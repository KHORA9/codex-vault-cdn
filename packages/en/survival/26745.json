J. J. VON TSCHUDI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN\r\n\r\n  BY THOMASINA ROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW EDITION, COMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK:\r\n  A. S. BARNES & CO., 51 JOHN-STREET.\r\n  CINCINNATI: H. W. DERBY.\r\n  1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Work from which the present Volume is translated consists of\r\nextracts from the Author's Journal, accompanied by his recollections\r\nand observations. The absence of chronological arrangement will be\r\nsufficiently accounted for, when it is explained that the zoological\r\ninvestigations for which the journey was undertaken frequently\r\nrequired the Author to make repeated visits to one particular place or\r\ndistrict, or to remain for a considerable time within the narrow\r\ncircuit of a few miles; and sometimes to travel rapidly over vast\r\ntracts of country. Disclaiming any intention of making one of those\r\ntravelling romances, with which the tourist literature of the day is\r\noverstocked, the Author has confined himself to a plain description of\r\nfacts and things as they came within the sphere of his own observation.\r\nBut though Dr. Tschudi lays claim to no merit beyond the truthfulness\r\nof his narrative, yet the reader will no doubt readily concede to him\r\nthe merit of extensive information, and happy descriptive talent. His\r\npictures of Nature, especially those relating to the animal world, are\r\nfrequently imbued with much of the charm of thought and style which\r\ncharacterizes the writings of Buffon.\r\n\r\nLima, the oldest and most interesting of the cities founded by the\r\nSpaniards on the western coast of South America, has been frequently\r\ndescribed; but no previous writer has painted so animated a picture of\r\nthe city and its inhabitants, as that contained in the following volume.\r\nAfter quitting the capital of Peru, Dr. Tschudi went over ground\r\npreviously untrodden by any European traveller. He visited the Western\r\nSierra, the mighty chain of the Cordilleras, the boundless level\r\nheights, the deep mountain valleys on the eastern declivity of the\r\nAndes, and the vast primeval forests. Whilst recounting his wanderings\r\nin these distant regions, he describes not only the country and the\r\npeople, but every object of novelty and interest in the animal,\r\nvegetable, and mineral creations.\r\n\r\nThose lovers of Natural History who are familiar with the German\r\nlanguage, and who may wish to make themselves extensively acquainted\r\nwith the animal world, in those parts of Peru visited by Dr. Tschudi,\r\nwill find abundant information on the subject in his work, with plates,\r\nentitled \"Untersuchungen über die Fauna Peruana.\" The present\r\nPublication, though containing a vast deal to interest the naturalist,\r\nis addressed to the general reader, and will, it is presumed, gratify\r\ncuriosity respecting the highly interesting and little known regions to\r\nwhich it relates. It may fairly be said that no previous writer has\r\ngiven so comprehensive a picture of Peru; combining, with animated\r\nsketches of life and manners, a fund of valuable information on Natural\r\nHistory and Commerce.\r\n\r\n                                                                 T.

French merchantman, was freighted with a\r\ncargo of Swiss manufactured goods, suited to any commercial transactions\r\nwhich might be entered into in the course of a circumnavigatory voyage.\r\nIt was a boisterous morning. A fall of snow and heavy clouds soon\r\nintercepted our view of the coast of France, and not one cheering\r\nsunbeam shone out to betoken for us a favorable voyage. We passed down\r\nthe British Channel, where the multitude of vessels, and the flags of\r\nall nations, presented an enlivening picture, and we finally cleared it\r\non the 5th of March. Favored by a brisk north wind, we soon reached\r\nMadeira and came in sight of Teneriffe, the peak being just perceptible\r\non the skirt of the horizon. Easterly breezes soon brought us to the\r\nisland of Fogo, which, having passed on the 35th day of our voyage, we\r\nreceived the usual marine baptism, and participated in all the\r\nceremonies observed on crossing the equator. We soon reached the tropic\r\nof Capricorn, and endeavored to gain the channel between the Falkland\r\nIslands and Patagonia; but unfavorable winds obliged us to direct our\r\ncourse eastwards, from the Island of Soledad to the Staten Islands. On\r\nthe 3d of March we made the longitude of Cape Horn, but were not able to\r\ndouble it until we got into the 60th degree of south latitude. In those\r\ndangerous waters, where it is admitted by the boldest English sailors\r\nthat the waves rage more furiously than in any other part of the world,\r\nwe encountered great risk and difficulty. For twenty-two days we were\r\ndriven about on the fearfully agitated sea, southward of Tierra del\r\nFuego, and were only saved from being buried in the deep, by the\r\nexcellent build and soundness of our ship.\r\n\r\nWe suffered much, and were long delayed by this storm; but when it\r\nsubsided, a smart breeze sprang up from the southward, and we held our\r\ncourse along the Pacific to the coast of Chile. After a voyage of 99\r\ndays we cast anchor on Sunday the 5th of June, in the Bay of San Carlos.\r\nLike the day of our departure from Europe, that of our arrival off\r\nChiloe was gloomy and overcast. Heavy clouds obscured the\r\nlong-looked-for island, and its picturesque shore could only be seen,\r\nwhen, at intervals, the wind dispersed the dark atmospheric veil. We had\r\nno sooner cast anchor than several boats came alongside rowed by\r\nIndians, who offered us potatoes, cabbage, fish, and water, in exchange\r\nfor tobacco. Only those who have been long at sea can form an idea of\r\nthe gratification which fresh provisions, especially vegetables, afford\r\nto the weary voyager. In a couple of hours, the harbor-master came on\r\nboard to examine the ship, the cargo, &c., and to give us permission to\r\ngo ashore. The long-boat being got out, and well manned, we stepped into\r\nit, and were conveyed to the harbor. The Bay of San Carlos being\r\nshallow, large ships, or vessels, heavily laden, are obliged to go three\r\nEnglish miles or more from the landing-place before they can anchor. Our\r\nboat was gaily decorated and newly painted; but this was mere outside\r\nshow, for it was in a very unsound condition. During our passage through\r\nthe tropics, the sun had melted the pitch between the planks of the\r\nboat, which lay on the deck keel uppermost. In this crazy boat, we had\r\nscarcely got a quarter of a league from the ship, when the water rushed\r\nin so forcibly through all the cracks and fissures, that it was soon\r\nmore than ankle deep. Unluckily the sailors had forgotten to put on\r\nboard a bucket or anything for baling out the water, so that we were\r\nobliged to use our hats and boots for that purpose. Fourteen persons\r\nwere crowded together in this leaky boat, and the water continued\r\nrising, until at length we began to be seriously apprehensive for our\r\nsafety, when, fortunately, our situation was observed by the people on\r\nshore. They promptly prepared to send out a boat to our assistance, but\r\njust as it was got afloat, we succeeded in reaching the pier, happy once\r\nmore to set our feet on _terra firma_.\r\n\r\nOur first business was to seek shelter and refreshment. There is no\r\ntavern in San Carlos, but there is a sort of substitute for one, kept\r\nby an old Corsican, named Filippi, where captains of ships usually\r\ntake up their quarters. Filippi, who recognized an old acquaintance in\r\none of our party, received us very kindly, and showed us to apartments\r\nwhich certainly had no claim to the merits of either cleanliness or\r\nconvenience. They were long, dark, quadrangular rooms, without\r\nwindows, and were destitute of any article of furniture, except a bed\r\nin a kind of recess.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I got on shore, I saw a multitude of small birds of prey.\r\nThey keep in flocks, like our sparrows, hopping about everywhere, and\r\nperching on the hedges and house-tops. I anxiously wished for an\r\nopportunity to make myself better acquainted with one of them.\r\nPresuming that shooting in the town might be displeasing to the\r\ninhabitants, who would naturally claim to themselves a sort of\r\nexclusive sporting right, I took my gun down to the sea-shore, and\r\nthere shot one of the birds. It belonged to the Gyr-Falcon family\r\n(_Polyboriniæ_), and was one of the species peculiar to South America\r\n(_Polyborus chimango_, Vieil). The whole of the upper part of the body\r\nis brown, but single feathers here and there have a whitish-brown\r\nedge. On the tail are several indistinct oblique stripes. The\r\nunder-part of the body is whitish-brown, and is also marked with\r\ntransverse stripes feebly defined. The bird I shot measured from the\r\npoint of the beak to the end of the tail 1 foot 6-1/2 inches. Though\r\nthese Gyr-Falcons live socially together, yet they are very greedy and\r\ncontentious about their prey. They snap up, as food, all the offal\r\nthrown out of doors; and thus they render themselves serviceable to\r\nthe inhabitants, who consequently do not destroy them. In some of the\r\nvalleys of Peru, I met with these birds again, but very rarely and\r\nalways single and solitary. I continued my excursions on the\r\nsea-shore, but with little satisfaction, for the pouring rain had\r\ndriven animals of every kind to their lurking-holes. After a few days,\r\nI went on board the \"Edmond,\" for the purpose of visiting PUNTA ARENA,\r\na town on the side of the bay, whither our boat used to be sent for\r\nfresh water. The ground surrounding the spring whence the ships obtain\r\nsupplies of water, is sandy, and it becomes exceedingly marshy further\r\ninland. After wandering about for a few hours, I found myself quite\r\nlost in a morass, out of which I had to work my way with no little\r\ndifficulty. The whole produce of my hard day's sport consisted of an\r\nawlbeak, a small dark-brown bird (_Opethiorhyncus patagonicus_), and\r\nsome land-snails. On our return, as we were nearing the ship, we\r\nkilled a seal (_Otaria chilensis_, Müll.), which was rising after a\r\ndive, close to the boat.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of June, all our ship's company were on board by order of\r\nthe captain. We weighed anchor, and cruized about for some time. At\r\nlength, about five in the afternoon, we returned, and the ship was\r\nanchored again precisely on the spot she had left a few hours before.\r\nIt was set down in the log-book that the wind was not sufficiently\r\nfavorable to allow the ship to pass out safely through the narrow\r\nentrance to the bay. But all on board were well aware that this was\r\nmerely a pretence on the part of the captain, who, for some reason or\r\nother, wished to stop longer at San Carlos.\r\n\r\nI was very much pleased at this opportunity of prolonging my stay at the\r\nIsland of Chiloe, hoping that better weather would enable me to make an\r\nexcursion into the interior. But the sky still continued overcast, and\r\nthe rain poured incessantly. One day, however, I undertook a journey to\r\nCastro, in company with the French Chargé d'Affaires to Peru, one of my\r\nfellow passengers on the voyage. A merchant accommodated us with two\r\nhorses, saddled in the Chilian manner; but he warned us to be on our\r\nguard, as horses were often restive when just returned from their summer\r\npasturage. We set off very promisingly. The commencement of our ride was\r\npleasant enough, though the road was steep and very difficult. It\r\nsometimes lay over smooth slippery stones, then through deep marshes, or\r\nover scattered logs of wood, which bore evidence of attempts to render\r\nthe ground passable, by this rude kind of paving. After we had ridden\r\nfor several hours in the forest, the rain checked our further progress,\r\nand we turned, to retrace our way back. Our horses seemed well pleased\r\nwith the project of returning home. For a time they proceeded with\r\nwonderful steadiness; but on coming to a part of the road where the\r\nground was comparatively level and firm, they quickened their pace, and\r\nat length dashed forward through the wood, uncontrolled by the bridle.\r\nThe long narrow saddle, with its woollen covering, the crescent-shaped\r\nwooden stirrups, and the heavy spurs, with their clumsy rowels, baffled\r\nall our skill in horsemanship, and it was with no little difficulty we\r\nkept our seats. We thought it best to give the animals the rein, and\r\nthey galloped through the umbrageous thickets, until at last, panting\r\nand breathless, they stuck in a morass. Here we recovered our control\r\nover them, and pursued the remainder of our journey without further\r\naccident, though we were drenched to the skin on our return to the town.\r\n\r\nOn subsequent days, I took my rambles on foot, and found myself richly\r\nrewarded thereby. The long evenings we spent in the company of our host\r\nand the harbor-master, from both of whom I obtained some useful\r\ninformation respecting the island.\r\n\r\nChiloe is one of the largest islands of the Archipelago which extends\r\nalong the west coast of South America, from 42° south lat. to the\r\nStraits of Magellan. It is about 23 German miles long, and 10 broad. A\r\nmagnificent, but almost inaccessible forest covers the unbroken line of\r\nhills stretching along Chiloe, and gives to the island a charming aspect\r\nof undulating luxuriance. Seldom, however, can the eye command a\r\ndistinct view of those verdant hills; for overhanging clouds surcharged\r\nwith rain, almost constantly veil the spreading tops of the trees. At\r\nmost parts of the shore the declivity is rapid. There are many inlets,\r\nwhich, though small, afford secure anchorage; but there are no harbors\r\nof any magnitude. While Castro was the capital of the island, Chacao was\r\nthe principal port; but San Carlos having become the residence of the\r\ngovernor, this latter place is considered the chief harbor; and with\r\nreason, for its secure, tranquil bay unites all the advantages the\r\nnavigator can desire on the stormy coast of South Chile. At Chacao, on\r\nthe contrary, reefs and strong currents render the entrance dangerous\r\nand the anchorage insecure.\r\n\r\nChiloe is but little cultivated, and scantily populated. If the\r\nstatement of my informant, the harbor-master, be correct, Chiloe and the\r\nadjacent small islands contain only from 48,000 to 50,000 inhabitants,\r\npart of whom live in _ranchos_ (huts), and part in a few villages. Next\r\nto San Carlos, and the half-deserted Castro, to which the title of\r\n\"City\" is given, the chief places are Chacao, Vilipilli, Cucao, Velinoe.\r\nIt is only in the neighborhood of these towns or villages that the\r\nforest trees have been felled, and their removal has uncovered a fertile\r\nsoil, which would reward by a hundred-fold the labor of the husbandman.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the island is moist and cool, and upon the whole very\r\nunpleasant. During the winter months, the sun is seldom seen; and it is\r\na proverbial saying in Chiloe, that it rains six days of the week, and\r\nis cloudy on the seventh. In summer there are occasionally fine days,\r\nthough seldom two in succession. The thick forests are therefore never\r\ndry, and beneath the trees, the vegetation of the marshy soil is\r\npeculiarly luxuriant. The constant moisture is one of the greatest\r\nobstacles to agriculture. To clear the ground for cultivation, it would\r\nbe necessary to burn the forests, and as the trees are always damp, that\r\ncould not be done without great difficulty. To some kinds of culture the\r\nsoil is not favorable. The cereals, for example, seldom thrive in\r\nChiloe; the seed rots after the ear is formed. Maize grows best; though\r\nit shoots too much into leaf, and bears only small grain. The damp soil,\r\non the other hand, is favorable to potatoes, of which vast quantities\r\nare planted. There is a degenerate kind of potato, very abundant in\r\nChiloe. On bisection it exhibits a greater or lesser number of\r\nconcentric rings, alternately white and violet; sometimes all of the\r\nlatter color. It is well known that southern Chile is the native land of\r\nthe potato. In Chiloe and also in the neighboring islands, potatoes grow\r\nwild; but, both in size and flavor, they are far inferior to the\r\ncultivated kind. Like the maize, they shoot up in large leaves and\r\nstalks. The climate is also very favorable to the different kinds of the\r\ncabbage plant; but peas and beans do not thrive there.\r\n\r\nIn the forests there are often clear spots on which the grass grows to a\r\ngreat height, and supplies excellent pasturage for numerous herds of\r\ncattle. The inhabitants of Chiloe breed for their own use, horses, oxen,\r\nsheep, and swine. The horses are small, and not handsomely formed, but\r\nvery spirited and strong. Some are scarcely twelve hands high. The cows\r\nare small and lank, and the same may be said of the swine and sheep. It\r\nis remarkable that all the rams have more than two horns; the greater\r\nnumber have three, and many are furnished with four or five. I\r\nafterwards observed the same in Peru. The domestic animals on this\r\nisland, notwithstanding the abundance of food, are small, and\r\nsickly-looking. I believe the cause to be want of care, for they remain\r\nall the year round exposed to every sort of weather and discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe population of Chiloe consists of Whites, Indians, and people of\r\nmixed blood. The Indians are now few in number, and those few are\r\nchiefly in the southern part of the island, and the adjacent islets.\r\nThey are of the Araucana race, and appear to be a sept between that\r\nrace and the people of Tierra del Fuego, on the one side, and the\r\nPampas Indians on the other. People of mixed races form by far the\r\ngreater portion of the population. They are met with in every variety\r\nof amalgamation. Taken in general, they are the reverse of handsome.\r\nThey are short and thick-set, and have long, straight coarse hair.\r\nTheir faces are round and full, their eyes small, and the expression\r\nof their countenances is unintelligent. The whites are either\r\nChilenos or Spaniards: the latter are almost the only Europeans\r\nwho have become settlers here.\r\n\r\nThe principal town, San Carlos, called by the natives \"Ancud,\" lies on\r\nthe northern coast of a very fine bay. Without a good chart, the\r\nentrance to this bay is difficult. Numerous small islands form a\r\nlabyrinth, out of which vessels, if not commanded by very experienced\r\npilots, cannot easily be extricated. Besides, near the land, the sky is\r\nusually obscured by clouds which prevent any observation for the\r\nlatitude, as the sun's altitude cannot be taken even at noon; and when\r\nthe sun gets lower, the hills, which would serve as guiding points,\r\ncease to be distinctly seen.\r\n\r\nSeveral whalers, which for some days vainly endeavored to work through\r\nthis passage, were afterwards obliged to direct their course northward,\r\nand to cast anchor in Valivia. One of the largest islands at the\r\nentrance of the bay is San Sebastian, where there are numerous herds of\r\ncattle. Cochino is a small island, distant only a few miles from San\r\nCarlos. It is hilly, and thickly crowned with brush-wood. It has only\r\none landing-place, and that is rather insecure for boats. The water of\r\nthe bay is remarkably clear and good; only round the little island of\r\nCochino, and along the harbor, it is covered with an immense quantity of\r\nsea-moss, which often renders the landing difficult. It frequently\r\nhappens that commanders of ships, wishing to go on board to make sail\r\nduring the night, get out of the right course, and instead of going to\r\nthe ship, steer to Cochino and get into the moss, where their boats\r\nstick fast, till returning daylight enables them to work their way out.\r\n\r\nThe poor inhabitants boil this sea-moss and eat it. It is very salt\r\nand slimy, and is difficult of digestion. Among the people of Chiloe,\r\nthis sea-moss occupies an important place in surgery. When a leg or an\r\narm is broken, after bringing the bone into its proper position, a\r\nbroad layer of the moss is bound round the fractured limb. In drying,\r\nthe slime causes it to adhere to the skin, and thus it forms a fast\r\nbandage, which cannot be ruffled or shifted. After the lapse of a few\r\nweeks, when the bones have become firmly united, the bandage is\r\nloosened by being bathed with tepid water, and it is then easily\r\nremoved. The Indians of Chiloe were acquainted, long before the French\r\nsurgeons, with the use of the paste bandage.\r\n\r\nThe town of San Carlos is dirty; the streets unpaved, narrow, and\r\ncrooked. The houses, with few exceptions, are wretched wooden huts, for\r\nthe most part without windows; but there is a board divided in the\r\nmiddle horizontally, the upper part of which being open, it serves for a\r\nwindow, and when both parts are open, it forms a door. The flooring\r\nusually consists merely of hard-trodden clay, covered with straw\r\nmatting. The furniture, like the apartments, is rude and inconvenient.\r\nThese remarks of course apply to the habitations of the very poor class\r\nof people. The richer families live in more comfortable style. Of the\r\npublic buildings, the custom-house and the governor's residence are the\r\nmost considerable, but both make a very indifferent appearance. In front\r\nof the governor's house, which occupies a tolerably large space of\r\nground, in the upper part of the town, a sentinel is constantly\r\nstationed. This sentinel parades to and fro, without shoes or stockings,\r\nand not unfrequently without a coat, his arms being covered only by his\r\nshirt sleeves. As to a cap, that seems to be considered as unnecessary a\r\npart of a well-conditioned uniform, as shoes and stockings. After sunset\r\nevery person who passes the governor's house is challenged. \"Who goes\r\nthere?\" is the first question; the second is _Que gente?_ (what\r\ncountry?) The sailors amuse themselves by returning jocular answers to\r\nthese challenges; and the sentinel, irritated by their jeers, sometimes\r\nruns after them through part of the town, and when weary of the chace\r\nreturns to his post.\r\n\r\nPoverty and uncleanliness vie with each other in San Carlos. The lower\r\nclass of the inhabitants are exceedingly filthy, particularly the women,\r\nwhose usual dress is a dirty woollen gown, and a greasy looking\r\nmantilla. In their damp gloomy habitations, they squat down on the\r\nfloor, close to the _brasero_ (chafing pan), which also serves them as a\r\nstove for cooking. They bruise maize between two stones, and make it\r\ninto a thick kind of soup or porridge. When employed in paring potatoes\r\nor apples, or in cutting cabbages, they throw the skins and waste leaves\r\non the ground, so that they are frequently surrounded by a mass of\r\nhalf-decayed vegetable matter. Their favorite beverage is _mate_ (the\r\nParaguay tea), of which they partake at all hours of the day. The mode\r\nof preparing and drinking the _mate_ is as follows: a portion of the\r\nherb is put into a sort of cup made from a gourd, and boiling water is\r\npoured over it. The mistress of the house then takes a reed or pipe, to\r\none end of which a strainer is affixed,[1] and putting it into the\r\ndecoction, she sucks up a mouthful of the liquid. She then hands the\r\napparatus to the person next to her, who partakes of it in the same\r\nmanner, and so it goes round. The mistress of the house and all her\r\nguests suck the aromatic fluid through the same pipe or _bombilla_.\r\n\r\nThe poverty of the people is extreme. Specie is seldom current, and is\r\nexclusively in the hands of a few traders, who supply the Indians with\r\nEuropean articles, in payment of their labor, or in exchange for the\r\nproduce of the island, which is sent to Chile and Peru. With much\r\nsurprise I learned that there is no saw-mill in Chiloe, where the vast\r\nabundance of trees would furnish a supply of excellent deals, for which\r\nready and good payment would be obtained in Peru.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants direct their industry chiefly to agriculture and\r\nnavigation. But rude and imperfect are their implements for field labor,\r\nas well as their nautical vessels. To a stranger nothing can appear more\r\nextraordinary than their mode of ploughing. As to a regular plough, I do\r\nnot believe such a thing is known in Chiloe. If a field is to be tilled,\r\nit is done by two Indians, who are furnished with long poles, pointed at\r\none end. The one thrusts his pole, pretty deeply, and in an oblique\r\ndirection, into the earth, so that it forms an angle with the surface of\r\nthe ground. The other Indian sticks his pole in at a little distance,\r\nand also obliquely, and he forces it beneath that of his fellow-laborer,\r\nso that the first pole lies as it were above the second. The first\r\nIndian then presses on his pole, and makes it work on the other, as a\r\nlever on its fulcrum, and the earth is thrown up by the point of the\r\npole. Thus they gradually advance, until the whole field is furrowed by\r\nthis laborious process.\r\n\r\nThe Chiloe boats are merely hulks. They obey the helm reluctantly, but\r\nthey bear away before the wind. Several individuals usually join\r\ntogether, and convey in these boats, the produce of their respective\r\nlocalities, in the southern villages, to San Carlos. Women as well as\r\nmen take their turn at rowing the boats, and after being out all day,\r\nthey run into some creek, where they pass the night. When a favorable\r\nbreeze springs up, they hoist a sail, made of _ponchos_. The poncho is\r\nan important article of male clothing in this country. It consists of a\r\npiece of woollen cloth, measuring from 5 to 7 feet long, and from 3 to 4\r\nfeet broad. In the middle there is a slit from 12 to 14 inches long;\r\nthrough this slit the wearer passes his head. The poncho thus rests on\r\nthe shoulders, and hangs down in front and behind as low as the knees.\r\nAt the sides, it reaches to the elbow, or middle of the forearm, and\r\nthus covers the whole of the body. The carters and wagoners in Swabia\r\nwear, in rainy weather, a covering somewhat resembling the poncho, which\r\nthey make out of their woollen horse-coverings. When a Chiloe boat is on\r\nits passage on the coast, and a sail happens to be wanted, the men give\r\nup their ponchos and the women their mantillas. The slits in the ponchos\r\nare stitched up, and both ponchos and mantillas being sewn together are\r\nfixed to a pole or bar of wood, which is hoisted to a proper position on\r\nthe mast. This patchwork sail can only be serviceable when the wind is\r\nfresh. At nightfall, when the boat runs into one of the creeks for\r\nshelter, the sail is lowered, and the sewing being unpicked, the ponchos\r\nand mantillas are returned to their respective owners, who wrap\r\nthemselves in them, and go to sleep.\r\n\r\nThere is but little trade in San Carlos, for Chile itself possesses in\r\nsuperfluity all the productions of Chiloe, and the inhabitants of the\r\nisland are so poor, and their wants so limited, that they require but\r\nfew foreign articles. The port is therefore seldom visited by any\r\ntrading vessel from Europe. Some of the Chiloe boats keep up a regular\r\ntraffic along the coast. They carry wood, brooms, hams, and potatoes, to\r\nValparaiso, Arica, Callao, &c., and they bring back in return, linen,\r\nwoollen and cotton cloths, ironware, tobacco, and spirits.\r\n\r\nNorth American and French whalers have for several years past been\r\nfrequent visitors to San Carlos, as they can there provide themselves,\r\nat a cheap rate, with provisions for the long fishing season. All the\r\ncaptains bring goods, which they smuggle on shore, where they sell or\r\nexchange them at a high profit. A custom-house officer is, indeed, sent\r\non board every vessel to examine what is to be unshipped; but a few\r\ndollars will silence him, and make him favor the contraband operations,\r\nwhich are carried on without much reserve. A French captain brought to\r\nChiloe a quantity of water-proof cloaks and hats, made of a sort of\r\nblack waxed cloth, and sold them to a dealer in San Carlos. To evade the\r\nduty, he sent his men on shore each wearing one of these hats and\r\ncloaks, which they deposited in the dealer's store, and then returned on\r\nboard the ship, dressed in their sailors' garb. This was repeated so\r\noften, that at length it was intimated to the captain that, if his men\r\nhad a fancy to come on shore with such hats and cloaks they would be\r\npermitted to do so, but it must be on condition of their returning on\r\nboard dressed in the same costume.\r\n\r\nThe people of Ancud (San Carlos), formerly so simple and artless, have\r\ngradually become corrupt and degenerate, since their frequent\r\nintercourse with the whale-fishers. Among the female portion of the\r\npopulation, depravity of morals and unbecoming boldness of manners have\r\nin a great degree superseded the natural simplicity which formerly\r\nprevailed. All the vices of the lowest class of sailors, of which the\r\ncrews of the South Sea Whalers are composed, have quickly taken root in\r\nSan Carlos, and the inseparable consequences of those vices will soon be\r\nfatal to the moral and physical welfare of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the island of Chiloe there are few quadrupeds. The\r\nlargest, the domestic animals excepted, is a fox (_Canis fulvipes_,\r\nWat.), which was first discovered by the naturalists who accompanied\r\nCapt. King's expedition. This is the only beast of prey. The coast\r\nabounds in seals of the sea-dog species (_Otaria chilensis_, Müll.,\r\n_Otaria Ursina_, Per., _Otaria jubata_, Desm.)--in sea-otters (_Otaria\r\nchilensis_, Ben.)--and in the water mouse (_Myopotamus Coypus_, J.\r\nGeoff). Among the birds, there are some very fine species of ducks, well\r\nworthy of notice, which are also found on the continent of South\r\nAmerica. There is the little Cheucau (_Pteroptochus rubecula_, Kettl.),\r\nto which the Chilotes attach various superstitious ideas, and pretend to\r\nforetell good or ill luck from its song. The modulations which this bird\r\nis capable of uttering are numerous, and the natives assign a particular\r\nmeaning to each. One day, when I wished to have some shooting, I took\r\nan Indian lad with me. Having levelled my gun at one of these birds,\r\nwhich was sitting in a low bush, and uttering its shrill _huit-huit_, my\r\nyoung companion firmly grasped my arm, earnestly entreating me not to\r\nshoot the bird, as it had sung its unlucky note. But my desire to\r\npossess a specimen was too great to be thus baffled, so I fired my gun\r\nand brought it down. I was engaged in examining the elegant little bird,\r\nwhen a mule, probably alarmed by the shot, came running at full speed\r\ntowards the spot where we were, and we deemed it prudent to get behind a\r\nhedge as speedily as possible. The infuriated mule made an attack on my\r\ngun, which was resting against the hedge. It was thrown down, bitten,\r\nand trampled on by the mule. The Indian boy turned to me, with a serious\r\ncountenance, and said:--\"It is well if we escape further danger! I told\r\nyou the bird had piped bad luck!\"\r\n\r\nThe day fixed for our departure from Chiloe now approached. The wind,\r\nwhich had heretofore been unfavorable for leaving the port, promised to\r\nchange, and we began to ship provisions. Whilst I was waiting for the\r\nboat which was to take me on board, I had an opportunity of observing\r\nthe dexterity with which the Indians slaughter their cattle. This\r\nbusiness is performed on the Mole, where, in the space of a quarter of\r\nan hour, and by two men only, an ox is killed, and the carcase cut up\r\ninto the proper pieces. When it is necessary to ship live oxen, the\r\nanimals are brought to the shore, where their feet are bound together,\r\nand then they are rolled over planks into the _lancha_ (boat). On\r\nnearing the ship, the Indians tie a rope round the animal's horns, and\r\nthen the sailors hoist him up with a strong tackle. It is a curious\r\nsight to behold a strongly-bound struggling ox, hanging by the tackle,\r\nand swinging between wind and water. My little Chilotean pony, which I\r\nintended to take to Peru, was dealt with more gently: he was got on\r\nboard with a girth, purposely made for hoisting horses on board ship.\r\n\r\nAt length we sailed out of the bay with a fresh easterly wind. Three\r\ncoasting boats, one of which was heavily laden with brooms, left the\r\nroads at the same time, and their crews said they hoped to reach\r\nValparaiso before us. But they had too great confidence in their\r\nround-bottomed keels, for they did not anchor in their place of\r\ndestination till five or six days after our arrival. The wind soon got\r\nup, blowing W.N.W., but rather flat. In the course of the night, during\r\nthe second watch, we were roused from our sleep by a heavy shock,\r\nfollowed by a peculiarly tremulous motion of the whole ship. We\r\nconcluded we had struck in passing over some hidden rock. The lead was\r\nthrown, but no ground was found; the pumps were set a-going, but we were\r\nfree of water. The captain attributed the shock to an earthquake, and on\r\nour arrival at Chile, his conjecture was confirmed. In Valdivia, in the\r\nlatitude of which place we were at the time, a severe shock of an\r\nearthquake had been experienced.\r\n\r\nAfter a pretty favorable passage of seven days, we anchored on the 30th\r\nof June in the harbor of Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Bombilla_ is the name given to this pipe, and the cup or\r\ngourd in which the decoction of the _mate_ is prepared, is called the\r\n_macerina_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nValparaiso and the adjacent country--The Bay--Aspect of the\r\nTown--Lighthouses--Forts--Custom House--Exchange--Hotels and\r\nTaverns--War with the Peru-Bolivian Confederation--First\r\nExpedition--Preparations for the Second Expedition--Embarkation\r\nof the Troops--Close of the Port--July Festival in honor of the\r\nFrench Revolution--The _Muele_, or Mole--Police--_Serenos_,\r\nor Watchmen--Moveable Prisons--Clubs--Trade of\r\nValparaiso--Santiago--Zoology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impression produced by the approach to Valparaiso on persons who see\r\nland for the first time after a sea voyage of several months' duration,\r\nmust be very different from that felt by those who anchor in the port\r\nafter a passage of a few days from the luxuriantly verdant shores of the\r\nislands lying to the south. Certainly, none of our ship's company would\r\nhave been disposed to give the name of \"Vale of Paradise\" to the\r\nsterile, monotonous coast which lay outstretched before us; and yet, to\r\nthe early navigators, its first aspect, after a long and dreary voyage,\r\nover the desert ocean, might naturally enough have suggested the idea of\r\nan earthly paradise.\r\n\r\nAlong the sea coast there extends a range of round-topped hills, 15 or\r\n16 hundred feet high, covered with a grey-brownish coating, relieved\r\nonly here and there by patches of dead green, and furrowed by clefts,\r\nwithin which the bright red of tile-roofed houses is discernible.\r\nHalf-withered cactus trees, the only plants which take root in the\r\nungenial soil, impart no life to the dreary landscape. The hills\r\ncontinue rising in undulating outlines, and extend into the interior of\r\nthe country, where they unite with the great chain of the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Valparaiso is open on the north and west; on the south it is\r\nprotected by a little promontory called the Punta de Coromilla. In this\r\ndirection the shore is steep and rocky, and the waves break against it\r\nwith great fury. From the Punta de Coromilla the bay extends from east\r\nto north-west in the form of a gently curved crescent, having a sloping,\r\nsandy beach, which rises very gradually towards the hills. On the north\r\nside of the bay there are several small inlets, almost inaccessible and\r\nedged with steep rocks. The bay is sometimes unsafe, for it is\r\ncompletely unsheltered on the north, and the heavy gales which blow from\r\nthat point frequently end in storms. At those times the bay is furiously\r\nagitated, the waves sometimes rising as high as in the open sea, and the\r\nships are obliged to cast their sheet-anchors. Many vessels have at\r\nvarious times been driven from their anchorage, cast ashore, and dashed\r\nto pieces on a rock called Little Cape Horn; for, when a violent gale\r\nblows from the north, it is impossible to get out to sea. Sailors are\r\naccustomed to say that in a violent storm they would rather be tossed\r\nabout on the wide ocean than be at anchor in the bay of Valparaiso. But\r\nagainst the south wind, though sometimes no less boisterous than the\r\nnorthern gales, the harbor affords secure refuge, being perfectly\r\nsheltered by the Punta de Coromilla.\r\n\r\nThe town of Valparaiso looks as if built on terraces at the foot of the\r\nrange of hills above mentioned. Northward it stretches out on the level\r\nsea shore, in a long double row of houses called the Almendral: towards\r\nthe south it rises in the direction of the hills. Two clefts or chasms\r\n(quebradas) divide this part of the town into three separate parts\r\nconsisting of low, shabby houses. These three districts have been named\r\nby the sailors after the English sea terms Fore-top, Main-top, and\r\nMizen-top. The numerous quebradas, which all intersect the ground in a\r\nparallel direction, are surrounded by poor-looking houses. The wretched,\r\nnarrow streets running along these quebradas are, in winter, and\r\nespecially at night, exceedingly dangerous, Valparaiso being very badly\r\nlighted. It sometimes happens that people fall over the edges of the\r\nchasms and are killed, accidents which not unfrequently occur to the\r\ndrunken sailors who infest these quarters of the town.\r\n\r\nViewed from the sea, Valparaiso has rather a pleasing aspect, and some\r\nneat detached houses built on little levels, artificially made on the\r\ndeclivities of the hills, have a very picturesque appearance. The\r\nscenery in the immediate background is gloomy; but, in the distance, the\r\nsummit of the volcano Aconcagua, which is 23,000 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, and which, on fine evenings, is gilded by the rays of the\r\nsetting sun, imparts a peculiar charm to the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe bay is protected by three small forts. The southernmost, situated\r\nbetween the lighthouse and the town, has five guns. The second, which is\r\nsomewhat larger, called el Castillo de San Antonio, is in the southern\r\ninlet of the bay. Though the most strongly fortified of the three, it is\r\nin reality a mere plaything. In the northern part of the town, on a\r\nlittle hillock, stands the third fort, called el Castillo del Rosario,\r\nwhich is furnished with six pieces of cannon. The churches of Valparaiso\r\nare exceedingly plain and simple, undistinguished either for\r\narchitecture or internal decoration.\r\n\r\nThe custom-house is especially worthy of mention. It is a beautiful and\r\nspacious building, and from its situation on the Muele (Mole) is an\r\nobject which attracts the attention of all who arrive at Valparaiso. In\r\nthe neighborhood of the custom-house is the exchange. It is a plain\r\nbuilding, and contains a large and elegant reading-room, in which may\r\nalways be found the principal European newspapers. In this reading-room\r\nthere is also an excellent telescope by Dollond, which is a source of\r\namusement, by affording a view of the comical scenes sometimes enacted\r\non board the ships in the port.\r\n\r\nThe taverns and hotels are very indifferent. The best are kept by\r\nFrenchmen, though even those are incommodious and expensive. The\r\napartments, which scarcely contain necessary articles of furniture, are\r\ndirty, and often infested with rats. In these houses, however, the table\r\nis tolerably well provided; for there is no want of good meat and\r\nvegetables in the market. The second-rate taverns are far beneath the\r\nvery worst in the towns of Europe.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival in Valparaiso, a vast deal of activity and bustle\r\nprevailed in the harbor. Chile had declared war against the\r\nPeru-Bolivian confederation, and was fitting out a new expedition for\r\nthe invasion of Peru. At its head were the banished Peruvian president\r\nDon Augustin Gamarra, and the Chilian general Bulnes. The growing power\r\nof Santa Cruz, who set himself up as protector of a confederation\r\nbetween Bolivia and Peru, had given alarm to the Chilian government. It\r\nwas apprehended, and not without reason, that the independence of Chile\r\nmight be threatened by so dangerous a neighbor. Santa Cruz had given\r\numbrage to Chile by several decrees, especially one, by which merchant\r\nvessels coming direct from Europe into a Bolivian or Peruvian port, and\r\nthere disposing of their cargoes, were subject to very low duties,\r\nwhilst heavy imposts were levied on ships landing any part of their\r\ncargoes in a Chilian port. This law greatly increased the trade of Peru;\r\nbut it was prejudicial to Chile. This and other grounds of offence,\r\njoined to the representations of the fugitive Ex-president Gamarra and\r\nhis adherents, determined the Chilian government to declare war. An\r\nexpedition under the command of General Blanco was sent to Peru; but\r\nSanta Cruz was prepared to receive the invaders, and in the valley of\r\nArequipa he surrounded the Chilian forces so completely that they were\r\nobliged to surrender without striking a blow. Santa Cruz magnanimously\r\nallowed General Blanco to make a very favorable capitulation. The\r\nsoldiers were sent home to their country; but the horses were detained\r\nand sold by the conquerors to the conquered.\r\n\r\nThe generosity of Don Andres Santa Cruz did not meet its due return on\r\nthe part of the Chilian government. The treaty of peace concluded by\r\nBlanco was not ratified in Santiago, the minister declaring that the\r\ngeneral was not authorized to negotiate it. Hostilities were kept up\r\nbetween the two states, and at length a second and more important\r\nexpedition was fitted out. It sailed whilst we were lying in the harbor.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had we cast anchor than several officers of the Chilian army\r\ncame on board to inquire whether we had any swords to dispose of,\r\nassuring us that they, together with the majority of their comrades,\r\nwere yet unprovided with arms, and knew not where to procure them. The\r\ncaptain informed them that there were no swords in our cargo; but that\r\nhe had a few sabres, &c., which he was very willing to sell. They were\r\nimmediately produced, and some were purchased; among the number was a\r\nheavy broad-sword, about five feet in length, which had once belonged\r\nto a cuirassier in Napoleon's guard. The Chilian officer who bargained\r\nfor it was a delicate-looking stripling, who, with both hands, could\r\nscarcely raise the heavy weapon. He, nevertheless, flattered himself\r\nthat it would enable him to achieve great deeds in battle and deal death\r\namong the Peruvians. Ten months afterwards I met this hero on a march\r\namong the mountains of Peru. He had, girded on, a light little sword,\r\nlike a tooth pick or a bodkin compared with the formidable weapon he had\r\ndiscarded, and which a sturdy negro was carrying behind him. I could not\r\nrefrain from asking the officer whether the trusty broad-sword had not\r\ndone good service in the battle of Yungay; but he candidly acknowledged\r\nthat he had not attempted to use it, as he found it much too unwieldy.\r\n\r\nThe Chilian squadron sent to Peru consisted of twenty-seven transport\r\nships, and eight ships of war. Almost all were in a wretched condition,\r\nhaving but few guns, and manned by very insufficient crews. The largest\r\nvessels were the three corvettes, Confederacion, Santa Cruz, and\r\nValparaiso. Only one ship, the schooner brig Colocolo, was distinguished\r\nfor solidity and swift sailing. The fleet was commanded by an admiral of\r\nlittle judgment and experience.\r\n\r\nAmong the crew there were but few Chilenos: most of the men were\r\nChilotes and French, English and American deserters. The officers\r\ncommanding the ships were almost all Englishmen. The transport ships\r\nwere heavily laden, some carrying troops, and others provisions. These\r\nprovisions consisted of sesino (dried beef), chalonas (whole sheep\r\ndried), maize, potatoes, dried fruits and barley, together with hay for\r\nthe horses. The embarkation of the horses was most clumsily managed:\r\nmany were strangled in being hoisted up the ships' sides, others slipped\r\nthrough their girths and were severely hurt by falling, and a\r\nconsiderable number of the poor animals died before the ships left the\r\nport. Every morning we saw dozens of dead horses thrown over board. The\r\ncontinued lurching of the vessels in which the cavalry was embarked,\r\nbore evidence of the inconvenient situation of the horses between decks.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of July the whole squadron sailed for the harbor of\r\nCoquimbo, where the troops were decimated by the small-pox.\r\n\r\nThere prevailed in Chile a feeling very adverse to this campaign; so\r\nmuch so that most of the troops were embarked by force. I was standing\r\non the _muele_ when the Santiago battalion was shipped. The soldiers,\r\nwho were in wretched uniforms, most of them wearing ponchos, and\r\nunarmed, were bound together two-and-two by ropes, and absolutely driven\r\ninto the boats.\r\n\r\nThis war proved most unfortunate to Peru, a result which, however,\r\ncannot certainly be ascribed either to the courage of the enemy's troops\r\nor the judgment of their commanders. We shall presently see the\r\ncircumstances which combined to secure triumph to the Chilenos.\r\n\r\nI and my fellow-voyagers were also sufferers by the war, our captain\r\nhaving imprudently announced his intention of selling the Edmond to the\r\nprotector Santa Cruz, as she might easily have been transformed into an\r\nexcellent corvette. She was a quick sailer, tight-built, carrying ten\r\nguns of moderate calibre, and she might easily have mounted ten more.\r\n\r\nThe captain's intention having reached the knowledge of the Chilian\r\ngovernment, the natural consequence was, that the port was closed, a\r\nmeasure deemed the more necessary inasmuch as an American captain was\r\nsuspected of entertaining the design of selling his ship to the\r\nPeruvians. It was not until the fleet had had time to reach Peru, and\r\nthe first blow was supposed to be struck, that the embargo was raised,\r\nand we obtained leave to depart. We lay in the port of Valparaiso\r\nfive-and-forty days. To me the most annoying circumstance attending this\r\ndelay was, that I could not absent myself from the port longer than\r\ntwenty-four hours at a time, as the ship was constantly in readiness to\r\nget under weigh, as soon as we should receive permission to sail, which\r\nwas hourly expected. My excursions were, therefore, confined to the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the town; and even there my walks and rides\r\nwere much impeded by constant stormy and rainy weather.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of July, preparations were made on board our ship for\r\ncelebrating the Paris revolution of 1830. At eight o'clock in the\r\nmorning we fired three guns, and the Edmond was soon decorated from her\r\ndeck to her mast-heads with flags and streamers. At the fore-mast gaily\r\nfloated the Swiss flag, probably the first time it had ever been seen in\r\nthe Pacific. When the guns on board the French ship-of-war had ceased\r\nfiring, we began our salute; but, as we had only ten guns, it was\r\nnecessary to load a second time. Our seamen, being unused to this kind\r\nof duty, did not observe due precaution, and the consequence was that\r\none of them had his hand so dreadfully shattered that immediate\r\namputation was indispensable. The day's rejoicing was thus suddenly\r\nbrought to a melancholy close.\r\n\r\nThe mole in front of the custom-house is exceedingly dangerous; so much\r\nso, that, during the prevalence of stormy north winds, it is impossible\r\nto pass along it. From the shore a sort of wooden jetty stretches into\r\nthe sea, at the distance of about sixty paces. This jetty has been\r\nsometimes partially, and at other times completely, destroyed by the\r\nwaves. The harbor-master's boats, and those belonging to the\r\nships-of-war, land on the right side; the left side is allotted to the\r\nboats of the merchant ships. On the shore there are always a number of\r\nboats ready to convey persons who wish to go on board the different\r\nships. Each boat is generally rowed by two Indians. Whenever any person\r\napproaches the shore he is beset by the boatmen, who throng round him,\r\nand alternately, in English and Spanish, importune him with the\r\nquestions,--\"Want a boat?\" \"Vamos á bordo?\"\r\n\r\nDay and night, parties of custom-house officers go round the port for\r\nthe purpose of preventing smuggling. In this, however, they only\r\npartially succeed; for they detect only petty smugglers, whilst those\r\nwho carry on contraband trade on a large scale elude their vigilance.\r\nThe captains of French vessels are notorious for this kind of traffic,\r\nand they frequently succeed in landing vast quantities of goods\r\nsurreptitiously.\r\n\r\nThe police of Valparaiso is probably as good as it is in any part of\r\nSouth America. _Serenos_ (watchmen) perambulate the streets on foot and\r\non horseback, and continually give signals one to another by blowing\r\nsmall whistles. For personal safety there is little risk, probably not\r\nmore than in the most populous cities of Europe. It is true that\r\nnocturnal murders sometimes take place; but the police speedily succeed\r\nin capturing the criminals, who, after a summary trial, are shot.\r\n\r\nIn Valparaiso, as in most of the towns on the western coast of South\r\nAmerica, the _serenos_ go about all night, calling the hours and\r\nannouncing the state of the weather. At ten o'clock they commence with\r\ntheir--\"_Viva Chile!_\"--\"_Ave Maria purissima!_\"--\"_Las diez han dado y\r\nsereno!_\" (past ten o'clock and a fine night!) or _nublado_\r\n(cloudy),--or _lloviendo_ (raining). Thus, they continue calling every\r\nhalf-hour till four o'clock in the morning. Should an earthquake take\r\nplace it is announced by the _sereno_ when he goes his round in the\r\nfollowing half hour. However, the phenomenon usually announces itself in\r\nso positive a way, that the inhabitants may easily dispense with the\r\ninformation of the _serenos_.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable objects in Valparaiso may be numbered the\r\nmoveable prison. It consists of a number of large covered wagons, not\r\nunlike those used for the conveyance of wild beasts. In the inside of\r\neach wagon, planks are fixed up like the board bedsteads in a\r\nguard-house, affording resting-places for eight or ten prisoners. A\r\nguard is stationed at the door, which is at the back of the wagon; and\r\nin the front a sort of kitchen is constructed. These wagons are drawn by\r\nthe prisoners themselves, who are for the most part destined to work in\r\nthe streets and roads, and, accordingly, they take their prison with\r\nthem when they are ordered to any considerable distance from the town.\r\nTo a country in which there may be said to be no winter, this sort of\r\nnomad prison is exceedingly well-suited, and the prisoners may be\r\nconveyed from place to place at very little expense.\r\n\r\nI went into some of these moveable prisons, and I must confess that I\r\nnever beheld such an assemblage of ill-looking faces as were collected\r\nwithin them. In the countenances of some of the prisoners unbridled\r\npassion and degrading sensuality were so plainly and so odiously\r\nportrayed, that one shuddered to reflect that such features could be\r\nan index of the human mind. Most of them were Creole Indians; but\r\nthere were a few Europeans among them. To me it was melancholy to\r\nbehold the European, who might be supposed to possess some little\r\nshare of education, mounting the prison steps chained to his\r\nfellow-criminal, the uncivilized Chileno.\r\n\r\nIn Valparaiso, as in all seaports, there is a heterogeneous mixture of\r\ndifferent countries, nations, languages, and manners, amidst which the\r\nnational character of the country is entirely lost. The trade in\r\nEuropean goods is very extensive, but almost exclusively in the hands\r\nof a few great North American and English houses, who supply the whole\r\ncountry with the articles they import. At times, such is the overstock\r\nof importations, that goods are sold at lower prices in Valparaiso\r\nthan in Europe. The warehouses are so filled with some sorts of\r\nmerchandise, that without any fresh supplies there would be sufficient\r\nfor some years to come.\r\n\r\nAmong the clerks in the mercantile houses I met with a great number of\r\nGermans, who all maintain an intimate association with each other. They\r\nhave formed themselves into a union, and they have a very commodious\r\nplace in which they hold their meetings. Following their example, the\r\nEnglish have united together and established several clubs. The French\r\nhave not gained any considerable footing in this part of South America,\r\nin which there are scarcely two French mercantile houses of any\r\nconsequence. On the other hand, there is abundance of French\r\nhairdressers, tailors, shoemakers, jewellers, confectioners, and\r\n_Chevaliers d'industrie_. Neither is there any want of _Modistes\r\nParisiennes et Bordelaises_.\r\n\r\nValparaiso is yearly increasing in extent and in the numbers of its\r\ninhabitants; but the town makes little improvement in beauty. That\r\nquarter which is built along the Quebradas is certainly susceptible of\r\nno improvement, owing to the unfavorable locality, and it is only the\r\nnewly-built houses on the heights that impart to the town anything like\r\na pleasing aspect. In laying out buildings in a place like Valparaiso,\r\nthe aid of art should make amends for the defects of nature. My visits\r\nto Valparaiso did not produce a very favorable impression on me. The\r\nexclusively mercantile occupations of the inhabitants, together with the\r\npoverty of the adjacent country, leave little to interest the attention\r\nof a mere transient visitor. The case may be different with persons\r\nwho, having longer time than I had to stay in the town, may enjoy\r\nopportunities of entering into society, and occasionally visiting the\r\npleasant valley of Quillota and the interesting capital Santiago.\r\n\r\nThe latter is thirty leagues distant from the port; but a very active\r\ncommunication is kept up between the two places, and better roads would,\r\nno doubt, increase the intercourse. A few years ago the roads were very\r\nunsafe; but now the journey may be performed without danger if the\r\n_Birlocheros_ (coach-drivers) are in the least degree careful.\r\n\r\nThe zoology of the neighborhood of Valparaiso is not very interesting,\r\nthough more so along the sea-shore than in parts further inland. Among\r\nthe Mammalia are sometimes seen the fox (_Canis Azaræ_, Wild.), and\r\nthe pole-cat. In the immediate vicinity of the town a very large mouse\r\nis seen in the burrows of the ground; it is of the eight-toothed\r\nspecies (_Octodon Cummingii_, Benn.), and has a brush-formed tail. As\r\nthe fields round Valparaiso are not cultivated these animals do no\r\nharm, otherwise they would be the plague of agriculture, and probably\r\nare so in the interior parts of the country. Now and then a sea-dog\r\nmay be observed in the bay; but the whale is seldom seen, and whenever\r\none appears he is immediately killed, as there is always a whaler at\r\nanchor and not far off.\r\n\r\nIn the market, live condors are frequently sold. These birds are caught\r\nin traps. A very fine one may be purchased for a dollar and a half. I\r\nsaw eight of these gigantic birds secured in a yard in a very singular\r\nmanner. A long narrow strap of leather was passed through the nostrils\r\nof the bird and firmly knotted at one end, whilst the other end was\r\nfastened to a wooden or iron peg fixed in the ground. By this means the\r\nmotion of the bird was not impeded: it could walk within the range of a\r\ntolerably wide circle; but on attempting to fly it fell to the ground\r\nhead foremost. It is no trifling matter to provide food for eight\r\ncondors; for they are among the most ravenous of birds of prey. The\r\nowner of those I saw assured me that, by way of experiment, he had\r\ngiven a condor, in the course of one day, eighteen pounds of meat\r\n(consisting of the entrails of oxen); that the bird devoured the\r\nwhole, and ate his allowance on the following day with as good an\r\nappetite as usual. I measured a very large male condor, and the width\r\nfrom the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was fourteen English\r\nfeet and two inches--an enormous expanse of wing, not equalled by any\r\nother bird except the white albatross. (_Diomedea exulans_, Linn.).\r\nThe snipes (_Scolopax frenata_, Ill.) found on the little plain\r\nbetween the bay and the light-house are in color precisely like those\r\nof Europe, from which, however, they differ in having two more\r\nfeathers in their tails. Small green parrots, little bigger than\r\nfinches, are tamed and brought to Valparaiso from the interior of the\r\ncountry. These parrots are very docile, and are easily taught to\r\nspeak; but they cannot endure cold, and require to be tended with very\r\ngreat care. In the bay itself there are numerous cormorants, and\r\noccasionally penguins and large flights of the cut-water or shear-bill\r\n(_Rhynchops nigra_, Linn.). The latter is distinguished by a\r\nsharp-pointed bill closing laterally, the under mandible being about\r\ndouble the length of the upper one. But the most beautiful bird in the\r\nbay of Valparaiso is the majestic swan (_Cygnus nigricollis_, Mol.),\r\nwhose body is of dazzling white, whilst the head and neck are black.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August we at length obtained leave to sail. Early on\r\nthe morning of the 14th we weighed anchor; and, as we sailed out of\r\nthe Bay of Valparaiso, the summit of Aconcagua soon disappeared in\r\nthe blue horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nJuan Fernandez--Robinson Crusoe--Passage to Callao--San\r\nLorenzo--Rise and fall of the coast--Mr. Darwin's opinions\r\non this subject--Callao--The Fortress--Siege by the\r\nSpaniards--General Rodil--Siege by the Chilians--The\r\nColocolo--Pirates--Zoology--Road to Lima.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a favorable east wind we reached, in thirty-six hours, the island\r\nof Juan Fernandez, which lies in the latitude of Valparaiso. Ships from\r\nEurope, bound to Peru, which do not go into Chile, usually touch at Juan\r\nFernandez to test their chronometers. It consists in fact of three\r\nislands, forming a small compact group. Two of them, in accordance with\r\nthe Spanish names, may be called the Inward Island and the Outward\r\nIsland, for the most easterly is called _Mas a Tierra_ (more to the main\r\nland), that to the west is called _Mas a Fuera_ (more towards the\r\noffing). That to the south, which is almost a naked rock, is the _Isla\r\nde Lobos_, which we may call Sea-dog Island. The two first are covered\r\nwith grass and trees. _Mas a Tierra_ is much longer, and better suited\r\nfor cultivation than _Mas a Fuera_. In form the two islands have a\r\nstriking resemblance to Flores and Cordua, islands of the group of the\r\nAzores. Until within these twenty years, _Mas a Tierra_ was the place of\r\nexportation for convicts from Chile; but as it was found that the\r\nfacility of escape is great, none are now sent there. In 1812 a number\r\nof prisoners of war were confined there, but the rats, which had\r\nincreased in an extraordinary degree, consumed all the provisions sent\r\nfrom Chile. Several fruitless attempts have been made to populate the\r\nisland, but that object is now given up, and it is only occasionally\r\nvisited by sea-dog hunters. Ulloa speaks of the great number of\r\nsea-calves or dogs with which the island was frequented, and\r\ndistinguishes kinds which belong to the short-eared species. Their skins\r\nare excellent, and they sell at a good price in England. Wild goats are\r\nnumerous, and their propagation would be excessive were it not for the\r\nmultitude of dogs, also wild, by which they are destroyed.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another kind of interest attached to Juan Fernandez. It was\r\non Mas a Tierra that, in 1704, the celebrated English navigator,\r\nDampier, landed his coxswain, Alexander Selkirk, with whom he had\r\nquarrelled, and left him there with a small quantity of provisions, and\r\na few tools. Selkirk had lived four years and four months on this\r\nuninhabited island, when he was found there by the bucaneers Woods and\r\nRogers, and brought back to Europe. From the notes which he made during\r\nhis solitary residence, the celebrated Daniel Defoe composed his\r\nincomparable work, ROBINSON CRUSOE.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued favorable, and in about a week we doubled the west\r\npoint of San Lorenzo Island, where some Chilian cruizers were watching\r\nthe coast. We soon entered the fine bay of Callao, and cast anchor in\r\nthe harbor of the _Ciudad de los Reyes_. While rounding the island, an\r\nAmerican corvette spoke us. She had left Valparaiso on the same day with\r\nus, and sailed also through the strait between San Lorenzo and the main\r\nland; yet, during the whole passage, we never saw each other.\r\n\r\nNo signals were exchanged between us and the shore, and no port-captain\r\ncame on board. We were exceedingly anxious to know the issue of the\r\nChilian expedition. Hostile ships of war lay off the port, but the\r\nPeruvian flag waved on the fort. At last a French naval cadet came on\r\nboard, and informed us that the Chilians had landed successfully, and\r\nhad taken Lima by storm two days previously. They were, at that moment,\r\nbesieging the fortress. We immediately went on shore.\r\n\r\nThe town presented a melancholy aspect. The houses and streets were\r\ndeserted. In all Callao we scarcely met a dozen persons, and the most\r\nof those we saw were negroes. Some of the inhabitants came gradually\r\nback, but in the course of a month scarcely a hundred had returned,\r\nand for safety they slept during the night on board merchant ships in\r\nthe bay. At the village of Bella Vista, a quarter of a mile from\r\nCallao, the Chilians had erected their batteries for bombarding the\r\nfortress. As it was difficult to obtain provisions, the commanders of\r\nthe foreign ships of war sent every morning a small detachment of\r\nsailors with a steward to Bella Vista, to purchase meat and\r\nvegetables. The merchant-ships joined in the practice, so that early\r\nevery morning a long procession of boats with flags flying proceeded\r\nto the Chilian camp. But a stop was soon put to this, as an English\r\nbutcher in Callao found means to go with the boats for the purpose of\r\npurchasing large quantities of meat, which he afterwards sold at an\r\nimmense profit, to the fortress. Though the besieged did not suffer\r\nfrom want, they were far from having superfluity.\r\n\r\nHaving sufficient time to make myself acquainted with the country in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of Callao, I took advantage of every opportunity for\r\nexcursions; going from place to place by water, which was more safe than\r\njourneying by land.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Callao is one of the largest and calmest on the west coast of\r\nSouth America. On the south-west, it is bounded by the sterile island of\r\nSan Lorenzo; on the north it flows into the creeks, which are terminated\r\nby the Punta Gorda, the Punta Pernal, the Punta de dos Playas, and the\r\nPunta de Doña Pancha. The beach is flat, for the most part shingly, and\r\nabout the mouth of the Rimac, somewhat marshy. Between the mouth of the\r\nRimac and that of the Rio de Chillon, which is a little southward of the\r\nPunta Gorda, there is a tract of rich marshy soil. A small boot-shaped\r\ntongue of land stretches from the fortress westward to San Lorenzo. On\r\nthis spot are the ruins of old Callao.\r\n\r\nSan Lorenzo is a small, long-shaped island, about 15 English miles in\r\ncircumference. It is intersected throughout its whole length by a ridge\r\nof sharp crested hills, of which the highest point is about 1387 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. On the north-eastern side, the declivity is\r\nless steep than on the south-west, where it descends almost\r\nperpendicularly into the sea. Seals and sea-otters inhabit the steep\r\nrocks of the southern declivity, and swarms of sea-birds nestle on the\r\ndesolate shore. San Lorenzo is separated on the southern side by a\r\nnarrow strait, from a small rocky island called El Fronton, which is\r\nalso the abode of numerous seals.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of Callao and San Lorenzo have undergone very remarkable\r\nchanges within a few centuries. Mr. Darwin, the English geologist, is\r\nof opinion that this part of Peru has risen eighty-five feet since it\r\nhas had human inhabitants. On the north-eastern declivity of San\r\nLorenzo, which is divided into three indistinctly marked terraces, there\r\nare numbers of shells of those same species of conchyliæ which are at\r\nthe present time found living on the coast. On an accurate examination\r\nof these shells, Mr. Darwin found many of them deeply corroded. \"They\r\nhave,\" he says, \"a much older and more decayed appearance than those at\r\nthe height of 500 or 600 feet on the coast of Chile. These shells are\r\nassociated with much common salt, a little sulphate of lime (both\r\nprobably left by the evaporation of the spray, as the land slowly rose),\r\ntogether with sulphate of soda, and muriate of lime. The rest are\r\nfragments of the underlying sand-stone, and are covered by a few inches\r\nthick of detritus. The shells higher up on this terrace could be traced\r\nscaling off in flakes, and falling into an impalpable powder; and on an\r\nupper terrace, at the height of 170 feet, and likewise at some\r\nconsiderably higher points, I found a layer of saline powder, of exactly\r\nsimilar appearance, and lying in the same relative position. I have no\r\ndoubt that the upper layer originally existed on a bed of shells, like\r\nthat on the eighty-five feet ledge, but it does not now contain even a\r\ntrace of organic structure.\"[2] Mr. Darwin adds, that on the terrace,\r\nwhich is eighty-five feet above the sea, he found embedded amidst the\r\nshells and much sea-drifted rubbish, some bits of cotton thread, plaited\r\nrush, and the head of a stalk of Indian corn.\r\n\r\nSan Lorenzo does not appear to have been inhabited in very early ages.\r\nThe fragments of human industry which have been found mixed in the\r\nshells have probably been brought thither by fishermen who visit the\r\nisland, and often pass the night on it.\r\n\r\nDarwin further remarks:--\"It has been stated that the land subsided\r\nduring this memorable shock (in 1746): I could not discover any proof\r\nof this; yet it seems far from improbable, for the form of the coast\r\nmust certainly have undergone some change since the foundation of the\r\nold town,\" &c.--\"On the island of San Lorenzo there are very\r\nsatisfactory proofs of elevation within a recent period; this, of\r\ncourse, is not opposed to the belief of a small sinking of the ground\r\nhaving subsequently taken place.\"\r\n\r\nBut satisfactory evidence of the sinking of the coast is not to be\r\nobtained in a visit of a few weeks' duration; nor must that evidence\r\nrest solely on geological facts, though doubtless they furnish much\r\nimportant data. History must aid the inquiry. Tradition and the\r\nrecollections of old persons must be attended to. According to these\r\nauthorities, a change more or less considerable has taken place in the\r\nlevel of the coast, after every great earthquake. If we refer to the\r\naccount given by Ulloa, and compare the plan of the harbor of Callao,\r\ndrawn by him in 1742, with the most correct modern charts, we do not\r\nfind much difference in the representations of the distance between\r\nthe main-land and San Lorenzo. Four years afterwards the great\r\nearthquake occurred, which destroyed the city of Callao, and plunged\r\nit into the sea. Subsequently there was a rising of the coast, which\r\ncould not be inconsiderable, for according to the statements of old\r\ninhabitants of Callao, the distance from the coast to San Lorenzo was\r\nso inconsiderable that boys used to throw stones over to the island.\r\nAt present the distance is nearly two English miles. I have no doubt\r\nof the general correctness of those statements, for a careful\r\ninvestigation of facts leads to the same conclusion; so that within\r\nthe last sixty or seventy years the sinking must have been\r\nconsiderable. It must be observed, however, that the ruins on the\r\nsmall tongue of land are not, as Darwin supposes, the remains of the\r\ncity of Callao, swallowed up by the sea in 1746, but of the Callao\r\nwhich was destroyed by the great earthquake of 1630.\r\n\r\nAnother proof of the sinking exists in the extensive shallow between\r\nthe coast of the main-land and San Lorenzo, called the Camotal. In\r\nearly times this shallow was dry land, producing vegetables, in\r\nparticular _Camotes_ (sweet potatoes), whence the name of this portion\r\nof the strait is derived. The inundation took place in the time of the\r\nSpaniards, but before 1746, either in the great earthquake of 1687, or\r\nin that of 1630.\r\n\r\nNorthward of the Bay of Callao, near the plantation of Boca Negra, there\r\nis a shallow, where, according to records, there existed a sugar\r\nplantation about fifty years ago. Turning to the south of Callao, in the\r\ndirection of Lurin, we find, at the distance of about two English miles\r\nfrom the coast, two islands or rocks, of which one is called Pachacamac,\r\nand the other Santa Domingo. At the time of the Spanish invasion these\r\nrocks were connected with the main-land, and formed a promontory. On one\r\nof them stood a temple or castle. At what period they were detached from\r\nthe coast I have not been able to ascertain authentically; but there\r\nappears reason to suppose that the separation took place during the\r\nviolent earthquake of 1586. Attentive investigations to the north of\r\nCallao--at Chancay, Huacho, Baranca, &c., would probably bring to light\r\nfurther evidence on this subject.\r\n\r\nBetween the facts stated by Mr. Darwin and those here adduced, there\r\nis considerable discrepancy. On the one hand they denote a rising, and\r\non the other a sinking. But it may be asked, might not both these\r\nphenomena have occurred at different times?[3] Mr. Darwin's opinion\r\nrespecting the still-continued rising of the coast does not appear to\r\nme to rest on satisfactory evidence. The relics of human industry\r\nwhich he found embedded among shells, at the height of eighty-five\r\nfeet above the sea, only prove that the elevation has taken place\r\nafter the land was inhabited by the human race, but do not mark the\r\nperiod at which that elevation occurred. Pieces of cotton thread and\r\nplaited rush are no proofs of a very refined degree of civilisation,\r\nsuch as the Spaniards brought with them to Peru, and cannot therefore\r\nbe taken as evidence that the elevation took place at any period\r\nsubsequent to the conquest. Garcilaso de la Vega traces the dynasty of\r\nthe Incas down to the year 1021, a period when the inhabitants of the\r\ncoast of Peru were tolerably well advanced in civilisation. Fernando\r\nMontesinos furnishes facts connected with the history of Peru, of\r\nseveral thousand years' earlier date; and, judging from the number of\r\ndynasties, the nature of the laws, &c., it may be inferred that\r\ncivilisation existed at a period of even more remote antiquity. It\r\ncannot therefore be determined with any accuracy at what time the\r\ndeposit at San Lorenzo, now eighty-five feet high, was level with the\r\nsea, or whether the rise suddenly followed one of those frightful\r\ncatastrophes which have so often visited the western coast of South\r\nAmerica. Then, again, the different degrees of decay presented by the\r\nbeds of shells seem to indicate that the rising has been gradual; and\r\nit may have been going on for thousands of years. Had the coast risen\r\neighty-five feet since the Spanish conquest--that is to say, within\r\nthe space of three hundred and sixty-two years--the Camotal would long\r\nsince have again risen above the surface of the sea; for it is very\r\nimprobable that it sank to a depth exceeding ninety or ninety-five\r\nfeet. It is evident that risings and sinkings have occurred at various\r\ntimes, and that causes contingent on earthquakes have produced the\r\nvariations in the rising and falling of the coast.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the accurate sounding of the depth of water in the\r\nCamotal, at stated intervals, would furnish the best means of\r\nascertaining the rising and sinking of the coast. A variety of\r\ncircumstances combine to favor the practicability of calculation by this\r\nmethod. For example, no river flows into that part of the bay in which\r\nthe Camotal is situated. The Rimac, whose mouth lies further to the\r\nnorth, is not sufficiently large to carry any considerable deposit into\r\nthe bed of the bay: moreover, there is but little tide, and the bay is\r\nalways calm, being sheltered on the south by the island of San Lorenzo,\r\nand north breezes are rare and never violent.\r\n\r\nI may here mention a singular phenomenon which has in latter times often\r\noccurred at Callao, and which, in 1841, I had myself the opportunity of\r\nobserving. About two in the morning the sea flowed from the shore with\r\ngreater force than in the strongest ebb; the ships farthest out were\r\nleft dry, which is never the case in an ebb tide. The alarm of the\r\ninhabitants was great when the sea rushed instantly back with increased\r\nforce. Nothing could withstand its fury. Meanwhile there was no\r\ncommotion of the earth, nor any marked change of temperature.\r\n\r\nIn the earthquake of 1746 Callao was completely overwhelmed by the\r\nsea. Several travellers have related that on calm days with a clear\r\nsky the old town may be seen beneath the waves. I have also heard the\r\nsame story from inhabitants of Callao. It is doubtless a mere fable.\r\nUnder the most favorable circumstances I have often examined the\r\nspot--the Mar brava, as it is called--without being able to discover a\r\ntrace of the ruins of old Callao.\r\n\r\nThe existing town of Callao is small, and by no means pleasant. In\r\nwinter it is damp and dirty, and in summer so dusty that in passing\r\nthrough the streets one is almost choked. Most of the houses are very\r\nslightly built, and they are usually only one story high. The walls are\r\nconstructed of reeds, plastered over with loam or red clay. All the\r\nroofs are flat, being made of straw mats laid on a frame-work of reeds,\r\nwhich is also plastered with loam on the under side. The windows are in\r\nthe roof, and consist of wooden trap-doors, which look very much like\r\nbird-cages. They have no glass panes, but gratings made of wooden spars.\r\nOn the inside there is a window-shutter, and a string hangs down into\r\nthe apartment, by means of which the shutter can be opened or closed.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting object seen in Callao is the splendid fortress.\r\nThough built on a flat surface close to the sea, it has a magnificent\r\nappearance. It consists of two castles, the largest of which the\r\nSpaniards named Real Filippe, but since the Revolution it is called\r\nCastillo de la Independencia. It has two round towers, wide, but not\r\nvery high. The court-yards are spacious. The walls are thick, rather\r\nlow, and surrounded by a ditch, which can be filled with water from the\r\nsea. To the south of this castle there is a smaller one, called El\r\nCastillo del Sol. Before the War of Independence they mounted both\r\ntogether four hundred pieces of cannon, many of which were of very large\r\ncalibre. At present they have only sixty pieces of cannon and\r\nseventy-one carronades.\r\n\r\nOn the fortress of Callao the Spanish flag waved long after independence\r\nwas declared in all the countries of Spanish South America. The Spanish\r\ngeneral, Rodil, threw himself into the castle, and with wonderful\r\nresolution held out against a siege of a year and a half. During the\r\nlast three months the Spaniards suffered all the privations and\r\nmiseries which a besieged army must endure within the tropics.\r\n\r\nLord Cochrane blockaded the fortress by sea, and General Bartolome Salom\r\ndrew up his army on the land side. More than 4,000 Spaniards fled to the\r\ncastle with all their valuable property, and took refuge under Rodil's\r\nprotection. The greater part of the fugitives belonged to the principal\r\nfamilies of the country. When provisions began to fail, the commandant\r\nfound it necessary to expel 400 women, and one morning they issued forth\r\nin a long line of procession. The besiegers supposed that the enemy was\r\nmaking a sortie, and directed the fire of their artillery against the\r\nhelpless beings, who, uttering loud shrieks, attempted to save\r\nthemselves by flight. As soon as the mistake was discovered the firing\r\nstopped, and the women were conveyed to Lima. Insurrections were several\r\ntimes attempted by the garrison of Callao; but the presence of mind and\r\ncool resolution of Rodil in every instance enabled him to suppress these\r\nmutinies. The guilty were punished with so much severity that the\r\nsoldiers soon gave up all further attempts. Horses, asses, dogs and\r\ncats, became at length the food of the besieged. Rodil at this time\r\ncarried on a traffic which does no honor to his character. He had a\r\nquantity of provisions stored, which he now sold at immense prices. For\r\na fowl he got from three to four gold ounces. He demanded proportional\r\nprices for bread, &c. A contagious fever broke out, and, of more than\r\n4000 persons who had taken refuge in the fortress, only about 200\r\nsurvived the siege. Hunger and disease at last obliged Rodil to yield.\r\nOn the 19th of February, 1826, he obtained an honorable capitulation,\r\nand embarked with his acquired wealth for Spain, where he was invested\r\nwith the rank of commander-in-chief of the infantry guards.\r\n\r\nSince the independence of Peru this fortress has often been the seat of\r\npartial revolutions. Its death-doom has been pronounced by different\r\ngovernments, and it will be a fortunate event for the country when it\r\nceases to exist as a place of warlike defence. It has lately been found\r\nuseful for other purposes, and a great portion of its vast space has\r\nbeen converted into custom-house warehouses.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Callao by the Chilians, of which we were eye-witnesses, was\r\nby no means such a serious affair as that undertaken by the patriots.\r\nThe squadron was weak, and the land army inconsiderable. Callao was only\r\ncannonaded during the night by some Chilian gun-boats commanded by\r\nEnglishmen. The artillery of the castle was inefficient, but the Chilian\r\nbombs did considerable damage. One Sunday afternoon the little Chilian\r\nbrig, \"Colocolo,\" sailed in close under the walls of the fortress, and\r\nthrew in some shot. The fire was immediately returned by all the guns\r\nthat could be directed to the sea-side; but in vain did the Peruvians\r\nexpend their shot. Every ball went over the \"Colocolo,\" and fell among\r\nthe neutral ships. The commander of the French squadron then sent a boat\r\nto the fortress, with a declaration that he would attack it in good\r\nearnest if the fire was not discontinued. The message had due effect.\r\n\r\nA few days after the affair with the \"Colocolo,\" the Peruvians had an\r\nopportunity of avenging the provocations they had received. The Chilian\r\nadmiral sent an officer, with seven sailors, to our ship to purchase\r\nshoes. The garrison having observed the Chilian boat, sent out a shallop\r\nwith twenty-five men, which came close alongside of us. In spite of our\r\nopposition the Chilian officer leaped into his boat and stood off. He\r\nwas, however, too late; for, just as he was leaving the ship's side, the\r\nhostile shallop passed under our bowsprit, and fired a volley into the\r\nChilian boat. Five sailors fell into the sea, either killed or wounded.\r\nOf three men picked up, one was the officer, who had received two wounds\r\nfrom musket balls. We saved one of the wounded sailors by throwing him a\r\nrope, by which we pulled him up, covering him with the French flag.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvians had no longer a fleet strong enough to keep at sea; but\r\nsoon after their government purchased the \"Edmond,\" and some other\r\nmerchantmen, and fitted them up as privateers. The command was given to\r\nM. Blanchet, who had been first pilot of the \"Edmond\" during our voyage\r\nfrom Europe. After he had taken the \"Arequipena,\" an old Chilian ship of\r\nwar, and burnt several transports, he attacked three Chilian corvettes\r\nin the harbor of Casma. They had already struck their flags, when\r\nBlanchet was shot while boarding one of them. His loss damped the\r\ncourage of the Corsairs, and the contest was soon given up. The shock of\r\nBlanchet's death had such an effect on the crew of the \"Edmond,\" that\r\nthey all went down between decks in great grief, except the cook, who\r\nfired a gun he had charged to the brim, and killed some men who were on\r\na bowsprit of one of the hostile vessels. He then sprang to the helm,\r\nand steered the ship safely into one of the inlets of the bay.\r\n\r\nThe lover of natural history finds in the bay of Callao numerous\r\nopportunities for gratifying his curiosity. The mammalia are not very\r\nnumerous. Sea otters and sea dogs are found there, as on all parts of\r\nthe South American coast. Two species (the _Otaria aurita_, Humb., and\r\nthe _O. Ulloæ_, Tsch.) inhabit the southern declivity of the Fronton.\r\nI went to hunt seals on the rock with the officers of a French ship of\r\nwar. When we landed, which was difficult on account of the breakers,\r\nwe fired at the animals and killed a number of them. A sailor waded\r\nthrough the breakers and bound the dead seals with a rope, by which he\r\ndrew them on board. As we shot a great number of birds, the Chilian\r\nadmiral, on hearing the firing, thought that one of his ships must be\r\nengaged with the Peruvian Corsairs; and, therefore, sent out the \"San\r\nLorenzo\" brig of war to see what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe bay abounds in fine water-fowl. Amongst the most remarkable is\r\nHumboldt's penguin (_Spheniscus Humboldti_, Mey.). A few are smaller\r\nthan the common grey penguin, and one is somewhat different in color on\r\nthe back and breast. The Peruvians call it _Paxaro niño_ (the child\r\nbird). It is easily tamed, becomes very social, and follows its master\r\nlike a dog. It is amusing to see it waddling along with its plump body\r\nand short legs, and keeping itself in equilibrium by moving its floating\r\nwings. I had one completely tame, which I bought from an Indian. It was\r\nnamed _Pepe_, and it answered readily to the name. When I was at my\r\nmeals he regularly placed himself beside my chair, and at night he slept\r\nunder my bed. When he wished to bathe he went into the kitchen and beat\r\nwith his bill on an earthen pan until somebody threw water over him, or\r\nbrought him a vessel full of water for a bath.\r\n\r\nI brought away a few of the marine birds which appeared the most\r\nremarkable. Among them was the banded cormorant (_Carbo Gaimardi_,\r\nLess.). On the back it is grey, marbled by white spots; the belly is\r\nfine ash-grey, and on each side of the throat there runs a broad white\r\nstripe or band. The bill is yellow and the feet are red. The iris is\r\npeculiar; I never saw its like in any other bird. It changes throughout\r\nthe whole circle in regular square spots, white and sea-green. Thousands\r\nof the spotted gannet (_Sula variegata_, Tsch.) inhabit the rocks of the\r\nisland of San Lorenzo. This bird is the greatest producer of guano. The\r\ninca tern (_Sterna luca_, Less.) is without doubt the finest of the\r\nwhole tern family. The color of the head is brown-grey; getting darker\r\ntowards the tail, and brighter on the lower body. From the root of the\r\nbill on either side there shoot out some white feathers slightly\r\ncurving, so that they give the appearance of white moustachios. Among\r\nthe land birds are some very fine colibri (_Trochilus Amazilia_, and\r\n_Tr. Cora_, Less.). The horse-protector (_Crotophaga sulcata_, Swains.)\r\nis a singular animal. It is about the size of a starling, with a short,\r\ncompressed and curved bill, having several deep furrows along its sides.\r\nThe tail is long and fan-shaped. The whole body is of a deep blue color,\r\nwith a slight metallic brightness. The bird is very social with cattle\r\nof all kinds, and more particularly with horses. It is fond of perching\r\non the back of a horse or an ass, and searching for insects which it\r\nfinds there in abundance. These animals are very sensible of the service\r\nthus rendered to them, and by the manner in which they move about when\r\nthe bird is perched on their heads or necks, show how much they are\r\ngratified by its presence.\r\n\r\nForeigners, when they visit the coast of Peru for the first time, are\r\nmuch surprised at the immense number of birds of the vulture species\r\nwhich they meet with about the roads and on the roofs of the houses. In\r\nCallao and in all other ports the Turkey vulture (_Cathartes aura_,\r\nIllig.) is frequently seen. It is called by the Spaniards _Gallinazo á\r\ncabéza colorada_ (red-headed vulture). Further in the interior of the\r\ncountry it is frequently seen, though there it is less common than the\r\nblack gallinazo (_Cathartes foetens_, Illig.). The color of the former\r\nis dark brownish-black; the unplumed head and throat are red; the\r\nthroat is full of wrinkles and warts. The latter is very like it in size\r\nand color, only the head and neck are greyish black. These birds are the\r\nsize of a turkey-cock; but they are lanker and more angular in form. The\r\nblack-headed gallinazo is inactive, heavy, and seldom flies far. When\r\nseeking food he hops about on the ground in short, regular springs. When\r\nhe wishes to move faster forwards he helps himself with his wings, but\r\nwithout flying. Its cry is seldom heard and never long continued. At\r\nnoon, sometimes from sixty to eighty of these birds perch themselves on\r\nthe tops of the houses or on the adjoining walls, and with the heads\r\nunder the wing they all go to roost. They are extremely voracious, and\r\ndevour every sort of animal substance they can find, however filthy it\r\nmay be. They are not in the least degree shy, for they hop about among\r\nmen and cattle in the most populous places. The Turkey vulture is far\r\nmore lively, and its movements are more light. It flies faster, and\r\ncontinues longer on the wing than the black-headed gallinazo. It is,\r\nhowever, more timid. It nestles in sandy rocks and uninhabited islands.\r\nThe female lays three or four whitish eggs, which are hatched in\r\nFebruary and March. The common gallinazo usually builds its nest on the\r\ntops of houses, churches, ruins, and high walls. The female lays three\r\nor four eggs, which are whitish brown and speckled, and are hatched in\r\nthe same months as the eggs of the Turkey vulture.\r\n\r\nAmong the amphibia in Callao, the iguana and land agama are numerous.\r\nSnakes abound in the low bushes at the mouth of the Rimac, and some\r\nkinds, which are venomous, live on the arid sand-banks. All the sea\r\ntortoises have been driven out of the bay, and now inhabit the detached\r\ncreeks of the uninhabited parts of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of fish are numerous.--Sharks, rays, ballancers, corvinas,\r\nbonitos, &c., are caught in abundance. Most of the corvinas and bonitos\r\nare carried to market. The flesh of the latter is firm, dry, and less\r\nsavory than the corvina. The _Pexe-rey_ (king-fish) is superior in\r\nflavor to the _Pexe-sapo_ (toad-fish), which is a little larger, and has\r\na thick, fleshy head. These fish are taken on rocks and under water,\r\nwhere they are struck by a kind of harpoon hooks and drawn out.\r\n\r\nWhen, on board the \"Edmond,\" I first saw the towers of Lima gilded by\r\nthe beams of the setting sun, and the chains of hills behind, rising by\r\ngradations, until in the farthest background they blended with the\r\ncloud-capped Cordilleras, I felt an inexpressible desire to advance\r\ntowards those regions, that I might breathe the air of the Andes, and\r\nthere behold nature under her wildest aspect. But these wishes were\r\nvain, and I was compelled to turn again to the desolate ocean; for it\r\nwas understood that our further voyage must be towards the north, and\r\nfrom there that we should proceed to the coast of Asia. I did not then\r\nforesee that my longing might be fulfilled, and that so much of\r\nenjoyment, together with so much toil and danger, awaited me in the\r\nmountainous regions of Peru.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the insecurity of the road to Lima I resolved to proceed\r\nthither. Carriages and horses were not to be procured in Callao, for the\r\nlatter were all either seized for the service of the government or\r\nconcealed. I could therefore travel only on foot. Don Manuel de la\r\nGuarda, the commander of the fortress, observed, whilst giving me a\r\npassport, that he would advise me to use speed, and to get as soon as\r\npossible out of the range of the guns, for he expected every moment to\r\nbe obliged to order the firing to commence. I did not neglect to follow\r\nhis advice. However I had not got more than a hundred paces from the\r\ncastle when the artillery began to play, and balls fell around on every\r\nside. I quickened my pace, and soon got near some fences, where men were\r\nfiring with muskets. There I was seized by some Chilian cuirassiers, who\r\nsent me forward from post to post, until at last in one of the posts I\r\nmet with an officer with whom I had been acquainted in Chile. When I was\r\ndining one day on board the corvette Confederacion in the bay of\r\nValparaiso, the young officer whom I have just alluded to sat next me.\r\nThe conversation happening to turn on phrenology, he insisted on my\r\nexamining his head, and pronouncing a phrenological diagnosis on it.\r\nThough I assured him that I attached no value on this alleged science,\r\nhe continued to urge me to make the examination. After feeling his head\r\nI observed to him, with great gravity: \"Here is the organ of\r\nmathematics pretty well developed, and it is probable that you may\r\ndistinguish yourself in that branch of knowledge.\" The fact was, I had\r\nobserved from his uniform that he belonged to the artillery, and since I\r\nwas obliged to say something, I thought it would be best to make my\r\nremarks refer to his profession. Don Antonio had not forgotten it, for\r\nas soon as he saw me at the outpost, he ran up to me quite overjoyed,\r\nand told me that I had judged rightly of his talent, for the guns which\r\nhe commanded always sent their balls direct into the fortress, and did\r\nmore execution than any other. By following my advice and cultivating\r\nhis mathematical organ, he assured me, he was enabled to direct a gun\r\nbetter than any other officer, and his aim could always be relied on. He\r\nimmediately procured me a pass, by which I was conducted all the\r\nremainder of my journey.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Callao to Lima is two Spanish leagues. The road is\r\ncovered with deep sand, and on either side are uncultivated fields and\r\nlow brushwood. After leaving Callao I came to Bella Vista, then to the\r\nruins of an old Indian village, and farther on inland reached some\r\nplantations. Halfway between Callao and Lima is the convent of _la\r\nVirgen del Carmen_, and also a chapel. The convent is now abandoned,\r\nbut in front of the chapel there constantly stands a monk, who begs\r\nfor alms. Close to the convent there is a Tambo,[4] in which brandy,\r\nlemonade, and bananas are sold. This place, which is called La Legna,\r\nis a Spanish league from both towns. The hired horses are so used\r\nto put up at this place, that it is only with great trouble they\r\ncan be got to pass it.\r\n\r\nThough much wearied by my journey on foot, I tried in vain to obtain\r\nsome refreshment here. Unluckily the Tambero, a Zambo, had decamped,\r\nas his house had often been plundered.\r\n\r\nIn the most oppressive heat I wandered over the shadeless plain, and\r\nat last reached the fine road called the _Alameda del Callao_, which\r\nextends from the Callao Gate of Lima to nearly half a league beyond\r\nthe city. Don Ambrosio O'Higgins, an Irishman by birth, first a small\r\nshopkeeper in Lima, then a soldier in Chile, and finally viceroy of\r\nPeru, with the title of _Marques de Osorno_, built the fine Callao\r\nGate and laid out the Alameda. On the 6th of January, 1800, it was\r\nsolemnly opened. The whole undertaking cost 340,964 dollars.\r\nResting-places are made in the Alameda at regular distances; and there\r\nare on each side charming gardens, with luxuriant fruit-trees. Happy\r\nin having reached the end of my wearisome journey, I quickly passed\r\nthrough the Callao Gate, and entered the City of the Kings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Natural History and Geology of the countries visited by the\r\nBeagle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. Darwin, in the work just quoted, says in reference to\r\nthis subject, \"Since our voyage, Dr. Tschudi has come to the conclusion,\r\nby the comparison of old and modern maps, that the earth both north and\r\nsouth of Lima has certainly subsided.\"--T.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Tambo_ is an Indian word, signifying an _Inn_. _Tambero_\r\nmeans _Inn-keeper_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nLima--Situation and extent of the City--Streets, Houses, Churches and\r\nConvents--San Pedro--The Jesuits--Nunneries--Beatarios--Hospitals--San\r\nAndres--The Foundling House--The Pantheon--The Palace--The Plaza\r\nMayor--Pizarro--The Cabildo--Fountains--Palace of the Inquisition--The\r\nUniversity--National Library--Museum of Natural History and\r\nAntiquities--Academy of Design--The Mint--The Theatre--Circus for\r\nCock-fighting--The Bridge--The City Wall--Santa Catalina--Barracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nLima is built on both banks of the river Rimac, which divides the town\r\ninto two unequal parts.[5] The larger part (the town, properly so\r\ncalled) is situated on the southern bank of the river; the smaller part,\r\nconsisting of the suburb San Lazaro, or the fifth section, is on the\r\nnorthern bank. The greatest extent of Lima is from east to west; from\r\nthe Gate of Maravillas to the Monserrate. Between those two points the\r\ndistance is 4471 varas,[6] or two-thirds of a Legua, or Spanish league;\r\nand the greatest breadth of the city, that is to say, from the Bridge\r\n(the suburb of San Lazaro not included) to the Gate of Guadalupe, is\r\n2515 varas, or two-fifths of a Legua. The utmost circumference of Lima\r\nis about ten English miles. The plain on which the city is built, takes\r\nrather a decided slope from east to west.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Lima intersect each other in right lines, and\r\nconsequently groups of houses form quadrangles: these are called\r\n_manzanas_. Each side of one of these manzanas measures on the average\r\nfrom 140 to 145 varas; and it may therefore be computed that,\r\ncollectively, they occupy a superficies of from 148,000 to 160,000.\r\nThere are in all 211 manzanas, of which those situated on the Periphery\r\nare the smallest and most irregularly constructed. Lima is divided into\r\nfive sections, which are again subdivided into ten districts and\r\nforty-six _Barrios_. It contains about 3380 houses, 56 churches and\r\nconvents (the latter occupying at least one-fourth of the superficies of\r\nthe city), 34 squares or open areas in front of the churches, and 419\r\nstreets. On the average the streets are about 34 feet wide and 386 feet\r\nlong. Most of them are very badly paved, but they have lateral\r\nfootpaths. According to the original plan for building Lima, it was\r\nintended that all the streets should run in one direction, viz., from\r\nsoutheast to northwest, so that the walls of the houses might afford\r\nshade both morning and afternoon. Between the Plaza Mayor and Santa\r\nClara this plan has been pretty uniformly carried out; but in other\r\nparts it has been less rigidly observed. At noon there can be no shade,\r\nas the city is situated in 12° of south latitude.\r\n\r\nThe impression produced at first sight of Lima is by no means favorable,\r\nfor the Periphery, the quarter which a stranger first enters, contains\r\nnone but old, dilapidated, and dirty houses; but on approaching the\r\nvicinity of the principal square, the place improves so greatly that the\r\nmiserable appearance it presents at first sight is easily forgotten.\r\n\r\nMost of the houses in Lima are only one story high, and some have only\r\nthe ground-floor. The larger class of houses correspond one with another\r\nin the style of building. In front they have two doors: one is called\r\nthe _Azaguan_, and is the principal entrance to the house; and next to\r\nit is the door of the _Cochera_ (coach-house). Either above the cochera\r\ndoor, or on one side of the house door, there is frequently a little\r\nchamber, having a window closed by a wooden railing. At this little\r\nrailed window the ladies are accustomed to sit and watch the\r\npassers-by--nor are they very much displeased when some of the latter\r\noccasionally make free to _reguardar la reja_ (to look at the railing).\r\nThe azaguan opens into a spacious court-yard called the _Patio_, on\r\neither side of which there are little rooms. Directly facing the\r\nazaguan, is the dwelling-house, round which there usually runs a\r\nbalcony. Two large folding-doors lead into the Hall (_Sala_), in which\r\nthe furniture consists of a sofa, a hammock, and a row of chairs: the\r\nfloor is covered with straw matting. From the sala a glazed door opens\r\ninto a smaller apartment, called the _Cuadro_, which is elegantly, often\r\nsplendidly furnished, and the floor is carpeted. This is the room into\r\nwhich visitors are shown. Adjoining the cuadro are the sleeping-rooms,\r\nthe dining-room, the nursery, &c. These apartments communicate with a\r\nsecond court-yard, called the _Traspatio_, the walls of which are often\r\nadorned with fresco paintings. This _Traspatio_, a portion of which is\r\nusually laid out as a little garden, communicates with the kitchen and\r\nthe stable (_corral_). A small avenue, called the _callejon_, forms a\r\ncommunication from the first to the second Patio, and is used as a\r\npassage for the horses. When there is no _callejon_, as is often the\r\ncase in the poorer class of houses, the horses are led through the sala\r\nand the cuadro. In the upper story the arrangement of the rooms differs\r\nfrom that of the ground-floor. Above the azaguan is the cuadro, opening\r\ninto a balcony, which is attached to most of the houses in Lima. The\r\nsala in the upper story forms an ante-room to the cuadro; and the rest\r\nof the apartments are built above the ranges of ground-floor rooms on\r\neither side of the patio. Above the sala and cuadro of the ground-floor,\r\nthere are no upper rooms. The roofs of those two apartments form a kind\r\nof large terrace called the _Azotea_, which is paved with freestone, and\r\nsurrounded by a railing. This _azotea_ serves as a play-ground for the\r\nchildren of the family; it is ornamented with flower-pots, and covered\r\nwith an awning to shade it from the sun. The upper story has a flat\r\nroof, composed of bamboos and mats, overspread with mortar or light\r\ntiles. In the houses of Lima, as in those of Callao, the windows of some\r\nof the rooms are made in the roofs. The other windows, of which there\r\nare but few, are on each side of the house door; they are tastefully\r\nornamented, and often have richly gilt lattices.\r\n\r\nThe style of house-building here described must of course be taken\r\nmerely as a general example; that there are numerous deviations from it\r\nmay naturally be supposed. In the large houses the walls are of brick,\r\nfaced with ornamental tiles (_adobes_). In the smaller houses, the walls\r\nconsist of double rows of bamboos, covered with plaster, and afterwards\r\npainted white or yellow. The fronts of the houses are usually quite\r\nplain, but here and there may be seen a house with a finely ornamented\r\nfaçade. The house of Torre Tagle, near San Pedro, and some others, are\r\nremarkable for the beauty of their ornaments, which attract the notice\r\nof all strangers visiting Lima.\r\n\r\nOwing to the heat of the climate, the doors and windows are almost\r\nalways kept open, so that the houses have not the privacy and comfort\r\nof European dwellings.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous churches and convents in Lima, some are deserving of\r\nparticular mention. The cathedral occupies the whole eastern side of\r\nthe Plaza Mayor. The foundation stone of this edifice was laid on the\r\n18th of January, 1534, by Don Francisco Pizarro, who named it the\r\nChurch of _Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion_. Ninety years elapsed\r\nbefore the building was completed, and on the 19th of October, 1625,\r\nit was consecrated by the Archbishop, Don Gonzalo de Ocampo. Such was\r\nthe pomp observed at this ceremony, that, though mass commenced at\r\nsix in the morning, it was five o'clock in the afternoon before the\r\nhost was raised.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the cathedral is exceedingly beautiful. The grand altar\r\nis ornamented with seven Ionic columns of silver, twelve feet high, and\r\none and a half thick, and is surmounted by a massive silver gilt crown.\r\nThe tabernacle is seven feet and a half high, and composed of\r\nexquisitely wrought gold, set with a profusion of diamonds and emeralds.\r\nOn each side of the altar there are massive silver candelabra, each\r\nweighing four and a half arobas (712-1/2 pounds). On high festival days,\r\nthe gorgeous splendor of the cathedral of Lima probably exceeds that of\r\nthe principal churches in Rome. The robes and ornaments worn by the\r\npriests correspond with the magnificence of the altar; they are\r\nembroidered in gold, and set with precious stones. The cathedral service\r\nis performed by the canons (Canonigos).\r\n\r\nAmong the Churches of Lima, San Lazaro is distinguished for its tasteful\r\nexterior, and the chaste simplicity of its internal decoration. The\r\nbodies of persons unknown, found dead in the streets, are conveyed to\r\nthe door of the church of San Lazaro, and there exposed for the space of\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe convent of San Francisco, the largest of the monastic\r\nestablishments in Lima, is an immense building, situated in the\r\nvicinity of the Plaza Mayor. In this convent mass is read daily every\r\nhalf-hour, from five in the morning till noon. A small chapel within\r\nthe convent is called the _Capilla de los Milagros_, and a\r\nsuperstitious tradition records that during the great earthquake of\r\n1630, the image of the Madonna, which surmounts the chapel door,\r\nturned towards the grand altar, and with folded hands invoked the\r\ndivine grace in favor of the city. By this intercession it is\r\nbelieved that Lima was saved from total destruction. The monk who\r\nconducted me over the convent, and who related to me this miracle,\r\nobserved with much simplicity that it was singular that the Madonna\r\ndid not repeat her gracious intercession in the year 1746.\r\n\r\nThe carved work which adorns the ceilings in the corridors is admirably\r\nexecuted, though not very beautiful in design. The cells of the monks\r\nare very simple, but perfectly comfortable for habitation. The spacious\r\nand well-arranged gardens within the area of the convent form a pleasing\r\ncontrast to the gloomy appearance of the external walls.\r\n\r\nTo the Franciscan monks also belongs the convent of _Los Descalzos_,\r\nsituated in the suburb of San Lazaro. A broad avenue planted with six\r\nrows of trees leads to Los Descalzos. It is a neat but not large\r\nedifice, and stands at the foot of a sterile hill. The extensive\r\ngarden which surrounds it, and which is in a very neglected\r\ncondition, contains three palm-trees, the only ones to be seen in the\r\nnear vicinity of Lima. The situation of the convent is not healthy,\r\nand in consequence the monks frequently suffer from intermittent\r\nfever. These monks go barefooted, and live entirely on alms. Every\r\nmorning two lay brethren ride on asses to the city, where they visit\r\nthe market-place, and obtain from the different saleswomen charitable\r\ndonations of fish, vegetables, or meat.\r\n\r\nAnother convent is the _Recoleta de San Diego_. During Lent, and\r\nespecially in Passion Week, many men retire to this place to prepare\r\nthemselves by mortification and prayer for confession and\r\nparticipation in the Holy Sacrament.\r\n\r\nThe convent of Santo Domingo is very rich. It enjoys a yearly revenue of\r\nfrom seventy to seventy-five thousand dollars, for the most part\r\naccruing from the ground-rents of houses in the city. The steeple of\r\nSanto Domingo is the loftiest in all Lima. It is 188 feet high, and is\r\nvisible at the distance of three leagues. It is built of wood, and\r\ninclines so considerably in its upper part, that there is little\r\nprobability of its surviving another earthquake like that of 1746. The\r\ninterior of the church is splendid. The grand altar almost vies with\r\nthat of the cathedral.\r\n\r\nSan Pedro must, doubtless, at a former period, have been the principal\r\nconvent in Lima. It belonged to the Jesuits, and was their _Colegio\r\nmaximo_. This establishment possessed enormous revenues, for all the\r\nfinest plantations and best houses in Lima were the property of the\r\norder. In 1773, the king of Spain, instigated by the celebrated Bull of\r\nthe 21st of June of that year (Dominus ac redemptor noster), dispatched\r\nan order to the viceroys of the provinces of South America, directing\r\nthem to arrest the Jesuits all in one night, to ship them off to Spain,\r\nand to confiscate their wealth. Of course the utmost secresy was\r\nobserved, and it is a well-authenticated fact, that in Peru, with the\r\nexception of the viceroy, and those of his agents whose assistance was\r\nindispensable, no one knew anything of the affair. But the same ship\r\nwhich conveyed the king's commands to the viceroy, had on board the\r\nnecessary instructions to the vicar-general in Lima, from the superior\r\nof the Jesuits in Madrid, who was fully acquainted with the king's\r\ndesign. The preparatory arrangements were made under the seal of perfect\r\nsecresy, and at ten o'clock at night the viceroy assembled his council,\r\nand communicated to them the royal commands. It was determined that no\r\none should be permitted to leave the council-chamber until the blow was\r\nstruck. At midnight some confidential officers, with the requisite\r\nassistance, were despatched to arrest the Jesuits, an accurate list of\r\nwhose names lay on the table before the viceroy. The patrols knocked at\r\nthe gate of San Pedro, which was immediately opened. The commanding\r\nofficer desired to see the vicar-general, and the porter ushered him\r\ninto the great hall of the convent, where all the members of the order\r\nwere assembled, evidently expecting his visit. The holy brethren were\r\nprepared for immediate departure, each being provided with a bag or\r\ntrunk containing such articles as were requisite on a sea voyage.\r\nSimilar preparations had been made in all the other convents belonging\r\nto the Jesuits. The surprise and disappointment of the viceroy on\r\nreceiving this information may be easier conceived than described.\r\nWithout delay he ordered the whole brotherhood to be conducted under a\r\nstrong escort to Callao, where they embarked. In the course of a few\r\ndays inventories were made of the effects in the convents. At San Pedro\r\nit was expected that vast treasures in specie would be found; but how\r\ngreat was the dismay, when, instead of the millions which it was well\r\nknown the order possessed, only a few thousand dollars could be\r\ncollected. All the keys, even that of the treasury, were politely laid\r\nout in the chamber of the superior. This was a cruel mockery! The\r\nJesuits could not have taken a more ample revenge on the treachery that\r\nhad been practised on them.\r\n\r\nIt was suspected that the treasures were concealed partly in the convent\r\nof San Pedro, and partly in the plantations. According to the evidence\r\nof an old negro, at that time in the service of the convent, he,\r\ntogether with some of his comrades, was employed during several nights\r\nin carrying heavy bags of money into the vaults of the convent. Their\r\neyes were bandaged, and they were conducted by two of the brethren, who\r\nhelped them to raise and set down the bags. The negro, moreover,\r\ndeclared his conviction that there was a subterraneous spring near the\r\nspot where the treasure was deposited. The searches hitherto made have\r\nbeen very superficial, and it seems not impossible that by dint of more\r\nactive exertions this concealed wealth may yet be brought to light.\r\n\r\nAt present San Pedro is occupied by about a dozen lay priests. They\r\nperform the spiritual service of the _Oratorio de San Felipe Neri_. They\r\nlive on the revenues derived from the rents of the few plantations which\r\nhave not been confiscated or sold. The chapel is prettily fitted up in\r\nthe interior, and the midnight mass at Christmas is performed there with\r\ngreat solemnity. The external walls of both the chapel and the convent\r\nare painted a reddish-brown color, which has a very sombre and ugly\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe convents of _Nuestra Señora de la Marced_ and _San Agustin_ are\r\nsituated at the back of San Pedro. The former is spacious, but not\r\nlargely endowed; the latter is a poor-looking edifice, but it possesses\r\nrich revenues. To San Agustin is attached the once eminent but now very\r\ninferior college of San Ildefonso.\r\n\r\nBesides the monastic establishments above named, Lima contains\r\nseveral smaller convents for friars, and sixteen nunneries. Of the\r\nlatter the largest is the Monasterio de la Concepcion. It is very\r\nrich, and has an annual revenue of upwards of 100,000 dollars; in\r\nother respects it is remarkable for nothing except the not very pious\r\nhabits of its inmates. _Santa Clara_ and the _Encarnacion_ are also\r\nlarge establishments, and well endowed. The nuns who observe the most\r\nrigorous conventual rules are the _Capuchinas de Jesus Maria_, the\r\n_Nazarenas_ and the _Trinitarias descalzas_. For extremely pious\r\nwomen, who wish to lead a cloistered life without taking the veil,\r\nthere are three establishments called _Beaterios_, which may be\r\nentered and quitted at pleasure:[7] these are the _Beaterio de\r\nPatrocinio_, the _Beaterio de Santa Rosa de Viterbo_, and the\r\n_Beaterio de Copacabana_. This last was originally established\r\nexclusively for Indian females. The _Refugio de San Jose_ is a place\r\nfor the reception of married women who wish to withdraw from the ill\r\ntreatment of bad husbands. On the other hand husbands who are of\r\nopinion that their wives may be improved by a little temporary\r\nseclusion and quiet meditation, can, with the permission of the\r\narchbishop, send them for a while to the _Refugio_. The _Recojidas_\r\nis another institution of the same kind, but destined for females of\r\nthe poorer class.\r\n\r\nLima possesses a great many hospitals, but all are lamentably\r\ndefective in internal arrangement, and above all in judicious medical\r\nattendance. The largest of the hospitals, San Andres, was founded in\r\nthe year 1552 by the Licentiate Francisco de Molina. Three years\r\nafterwards, the Viceroy Don Andres Hurtado de Mendoza, first Marquis\r\nde Cañete, placed it under the direction of the Government. Down to\r\nthe year 1826 this hospital was exclusively destined for the\r\nreception of sick Spaniards. San Andres contains five large and four\r\nsmaller wards, with 387 beds. One part of the establishment is set\r\napart for incurable patients. The annual outlay of the hospital\r\namounts to between 45,000 and 50,000 dollars. In the hospital of San\r\nAndres insane patients are received, and their number is always\r\nconsiderable. On the 30th of November (St. Andrew's Day) this\r\nhospital is opened for the admittance of the public, and one of the\r\nfavorite amusements of the inhabitants of Lima is to go to San Andres\r\nto see the lunatics. It is melancholy to observe these unfortunate\r\nbeings, thus made the objects of public exhibition, and irritated by\r\nthe idle throng who go to stare at them. The collection of alms from\r\nthe numerous visitors is, doubtless, the motive for keeping up this\r\ncustom, which, nevertheless, is exceedingly reprehensible.\r\n\r\nThe hospital _Santa Ana_ was founded in the year 1549, by Don Fray\r\nGeronimo de Loyza, first Archbishop of Lima, and was destined for\r\nIndians of both sexes. The benevolent founder, with the most earnest\r\nself-devotion, attended the patients, and with true Christian charity\r\nperformed the humblest duties of a sick-nurse. He died in 1575 in the\r\nhospital, to which he bequeathed a yearly revenue of 16,000 dollars.\r\nThe building contains five large wards, and 336 beds. Since the\r\ndeclaration of independence no Indian has been received into it. This\r\nhospital, alternately with those of San Andres and San Bartolome, was\r\nused as a military lazaretto; but since 1841 it has been allotted\r\nexclusively to female patients of all classes; for it was found\r\nnecessary to abandon the former female hospital of _La Caridad_, on\r\naccount of its damp situation.\r\n\r\n_San Bartolome_ was an hospital founded in the year 1661, for negro\r\npatients; but it has lately been closed. It contains eleven wards\r\nand 217 beds.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of Santo Toribio an hospital for incurable patients was\r\nestablished in the year 1669, by Don Domingo Cueto.\r\n\r\nIn 1702 it was consigned to the superintendence of an order of monks,\r\ncalled the padres Belemitas, and in 1822 it was incorporated with the\r\nhospital of San Lazaro. The latter establishment was founded by Anton\r\nSanchez, in the year 1563, and was exclusively destined for leprous\r\npatients. Persons afflicted with cutaneous diseases, and especially\r\nmaladies of a contagious nature, are sent thither.\r\n\r\nIn the convent of San Pedro there is a small hospital for poor priests.\r\nAttached to it is a dispensary, from whence the poor were supplied\r\ngratuitously with medicines, at the time when the convent was in the\r\npossession of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nLima also possesses a Foundling Hospital. Luis Ojeda, who humbly took to\r\nhimself the title of _Luis el Pecador_ (Luis the Sinner), bequeathed all\r\nhis fortune to the foundation of this establishment, which received the\r\nname of \"Collegio de Santa Cruz de los niños expositos.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe refuge for female penitents was founded in the year 1670 by the\r\nviceroy, Count de Lemos. The funds were derived from a legacy\r\nbequeathed for that object by Don Francisco Arcain in 1572. The\r\nestablishment has but few inmates.\r\n\r\nIn former times it was the custom in Lima to bury the dead in graves\r\ndug within the churches; but the heat of the climate, and the\r\ndifficulty of making the graves sufficiently deep, rendering this\r\npractice exceedingly objectionable, the viceroy, Don Jose Fernando\r\nAbascal, determined on making a burial place beyond the boundaries of\r\nthe city. A piece of ground was allotted for the purpose, and it was\r\nconsecrated on the 1st of January, 1808. It is called the _Cementerio\r\ngèneral_ or _Panteon_, and is situated eastward of the city on the\r\nhigh road leading to the Sierra de Tarma. It consists of two gardens,\r\nvery prettily planted, and inclosed by high walls. Along the walls,\r\non the inner side, there are niches, about a thousand in number,\r\nranged in sixteen different classes, and they may be purchased by\r\nthose who wish to possess them. Many of them belong to families and\r\nconvents. The graves are watched and kept in order by criminals who\r\nare condemned to this duty as a punishment. It is calculated that it\r\nwill be five years before this cemetery is filled. When room is\r\nwanting, the niches which have been first occupied will be cleared,\r\nand the bones deposited in a bone-house, of simple but appropriate\r\nconstruction. At the entrance of the Panteon there is a neat little\r\nchapel, where the funeral obsequies are performed. Burials are\r\npermitted to take place only in the morning; and when a funeral\r\nretinue arrives too late, the body remains uninterred until the\r\nfollowing morning. The rich are buried in coffins, the poor merely in\r\nwinding sheets, which are made after the pattern of the habits worn\r\nby the barefooted friars of the order of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe grand square of Lima, the _Plaza Mayor_, though not in the centre\r\nof the city, is nevertheless the central point of its life and\r\nbusiness. It is 426 feet distant from the Rimac, and presents a\r\nregular quadrangle, each side of which is 510 feet long. From each of\r\nthe four corners two handsome straight streets run at right angles.\r\nThere is no pavement, but the ground is covered with fine sand. The\r\ncathedral and the archbishop's palace occupy the eastern side of the\r\nsquare. The latter adjoins the sanctuary, and has rather a fine\r\nfaçade. The windows of the principal apartments open into a balcony,\r\ncommanding a view of the Plaza.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the square stands the government palace,\r\nformerly the residence of the all-powerful viceroys. Its exterior\r\naspect is mean. It is a square building, and the front next the Plaza\r\nis disfigured by a long range of shabby little shops (called _La\r\nrivera_), in which drugs are sold.[9] These shops are surmounted by a\r\nbalcony. A large double door opens from the Plaza into the great\r\ncourt-yard of the palace. Along the western side of the building there\r\nare also a number of little shops occupied by saddlers and dealers in\r\nold iron. The street, running in this direction, is called the Old\r\nIron Street (Calle del Fierro Viego). The principal entrance to the\r\npalace is on this side. On the south the building has no entrance, and\r\nit presents the gloomy aspect of a jail. On the east a door opens into\r\na small yard or court, within which are the office and prison of the\r\npolice. A few long flag-staffs, fixed on the roof of the palace, do\r\nnot add to the beauty of the edifice. The interior of the building\r\ncorresponds with its outward appearance, being at once tasteless and\r\nmean. The largest apartment formerly bore the name of the _Sala de los\r\nVireyes_. It is now used as a ball room when entertainments are given\r\nby the government. Under the Spanish domination this room was hung\r\nround with portraits of the viceroys, the size of life.[10] The series\r\nof vice-regal portraits from Pizarro to Pezuela, forty-four in number,\r\ncompletely filled the apartment at the time when the patriot army in\r\nLima revolted, and consequently the last viceroy, Don Jose de la\r\nSerna, who owed his elevation to the military revolution, could not\r\nhave a place assigned for his portrait among those of his\r\npredecessors.[11] The other apartments of the palace are small and\r\ninelegant. Some of the rooms are used as government offices.\r\n\r\nThe present palace was, as far as I have been able to ascertain, built\r\nabout the beginning of the seventeenth century. In the great\r\nearthquake of 1687 it was almost totally destroyed, but it was\r\nsubsequently restored. The palace which Don Francisco Pizarro built\r\nfor his own residence, stood, not on the site of the existing edifice,\r\nbut on the southern side of the Plaza, on the spot where now a narrow\r\ndirty alley, called the _Callejon de petateros_, forms a communication\r\nbetween the Plaza and the Silversmith's street (_Calle de Plateros_).\r\nIt was in that old palace that Juan de Herada, the friend and partisan\r\nof Don Diego de Almagra, carried into effect his plot against\r\nPizarro. On the 26th of June, 1546, the viceroy was seated at table\r\nwith a party of his friends, when the insurgents surrounded the\r\npalace, shouting \"Death to the tyrants!\" Pizarro, though warned of his\r\ndanger, had scarcely time to seize his sword. One of his principal\r\nofficers, Don Francisco de Chavez, was killed at the door of the\r\napartment, and several of the viceroy's friends and servants escaped\r\nby the windows. Among others who attempted to save themselves in this\r\nway was Pizarro's counsellor, Juan de Velasquez. Only on the previous\r\nevening this man had been heard to declare that no one would be found\r\nbold enough to join in an insurrection as long as he held in his hand\r\nhis staff of authority. This declaration was in a certain measure\r\nverified, for Velasquez, whilst descending from the window, held his\r\nstaff between his teeth, that he might be the better able to support\r\nhimself with his hands. Martin Pizarro, together with two noblemen and\r\ntwo pages, were the only persons who remained faithful to the viceroy.\r\nThe latter, with the bravery of a lion, made a long stand against his\r\nassailants. \"Courage, brother! Down with the traitors!\" exclaimed\r\nMartin Pizarro, who, the next moment, lay dead at the viceroy's feet.\r\nAt length Pizarro, exhausted by his efforts to defend himself, could\r\nno longer wield his hitherto victorious sword: he was overpowered, and\r\none of his assailants having stabbed him in the throat, he fell,\r\nmortally wounded. With his last faltering accents he implored the aid\r\nof a confessor; and after losing the power of utterance he traced with\r\nhis finger, on the ground, the sign of the cross, kissed it\r\nrepeatedly, and breathed his last. Such was the sad end of one of the\r\ngreatest heroes of his age;[12] a man guilty of many crimes, but also\r\nunjustly accused of many of which he was innocent. His acts were\r\nconsistent with the spirit of his age, and were influenced by the\r\nfrightful circumstances in which he was placed. In short, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that Pizarro was \"better than his fame.\"\r\n\r\nThe west side of the Plaza Mayor is occupied by the _Cabildo_, or\r\nsenate-house (formerly called the _Casa Consistorial_), together with\r\nthe city jail, and a row of houses of no very handsome appearance.\r\nThe south side is filled by a range of private dwelling-houses, with\r\nbalconies looking to the Plaza. The houses, both on the west and\r\nsouth sides of the square, are built above a colonnade, in which\r\nthere are numerous shops.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the Plaza is a magnificent bronze fountain with three\r\nbasins. From the middle basin rises a pillar, surmounted by a figure\r\nof Fame spouting the water from her trumpet. In the other two basins\r\nthe water is ejected from the mouths of four lions. The pillar and\r\nfigures for this triple fountain were cast in the year 1650, by the\r\nable artist Antonio Rivas, by order of the then reigning viceroy,\r\nCount de Salvatierra. Besides this principal fountain, there are\r\nseveral smaller ones, from which the public are permitted to supply\r\nthemselves with water.\r\n\r\nThe second large public square in Lima is the _Plaza de la\r\nInquisicion_, which, since the war of independence, has received the\r\nname of the Square of Independence (_Plazuela de la Independencia_).\r\nIt is of trapezi-form, widening in the eastern part, and is certainly\r\nno ornament to the town, for it is always in a very dirty condition.\r\nBeing the public market-place, it presents a very busy aspect during\r\nthe fore part of the day. Two buildings on this Plazuela attract\r\nattention, viz.--the Palace of the Inquisition and the University.\r\nThere are now but few remaining traces of the internal arrangements of\r\nthe fearful tribunal; for, on the suppression of the Inquisition by\r\nthe Cortes, the enraged populace forced their way into the building,\r\nwhere they gutted the rooms, and destroyed the furniture. Lima was the\r\nseat of spiritual jurisdiction for the whole western coast of South\r\nAmerica; and the rigor of its despotism was not far short of that of\r\nthe Inquisition of Madrid. Every year vast numbers of persons\r\nconvicted or suspected of crimes were brought from all the intervening\r\npoints between Chiloe and Columbia to the Tribunal of the Inquisition,\r\nand most of them were doomed to the most dreadful punishments. _Autos\r\nda fe_ were frequently held in Lima, and cases of other kinds of\r\nmartyrdom were exceedingly numerous. The lists, which have been only\r\npartially preserved, present melancholy results. One part of the\r\nPalace of the Inquisition is now converted into a store-house for\r\nprovisions, and the other part is used as a prison.\r\n\r\nThe University of Lima was once the most important seat of education\r\nin South America. It owes its origin to a decree of the emperor\r\nCharles V., issued at the solicitation of the dominican monk Maestro\r\nFray Tomas de San Martin. The decree was dated the 12th of May, 1551,\r\nbut it did not reach Lima until two years after that time. A papal\r\nbull of Pius V. confirmed the imperial decree, and conferred on the\r\ninstitution the same privileges as those enjoyed by the Spanish\r\nuniversity of Salamanca. The Lima university was originally\r\nestablished in the convent of Santo Domingo, but after the lapse of\r\nthree years it was removed to the building now occupied by San Marcel,\r\nand in 1576 it was installed in the site it now occupies. It received\r\nthe name of _Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Marcos_. In the year\r\n1572 the first lay rector was elected in the person of Gaspar\r\nMenendez, a doctor of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe building is situated on the east side of the _Plaza de la\r\nIndependencia_, next to the hospital of _la Caridad_. The façade is not\r\nhandsome, but is remarkable for a style not belonging to the age in\r\nwhich it was erected. The building is entered by a lofty door, opening\r\ninto a spacious quadrangular court, along the four sides of which there\r\nare pillared corridors. On the walls of these corridors the different\r\nbranches of science are allegorically represented in fresco paintings,\r\nand beneath these paintings are inscribed quotations from ancient\r\nclassic authors. The lecture rooms open into the corridors which run\r\nround the court. Facing the entrance door, in the left angle of the\r\ncourt, are great double doors opening into the Aula, which is spacious,\r\nand has rather an imposing aspect. In the middle of the wall, on the\r\nright-hand side, stands the rector's chair in a sort of niche,\r\nsurmounted by a canopy. On either side of this chair are ranged the\r\nseats of the professors, and the members of faculties. Opposite to the\r\nrector's seat, on the left-hand side of the Aula, is an elevated chair\r\noccupied by the president, when academic prizes are distributed. Below\r\nit is an arm-chair for the candidate. On each side of the president's\r\nseat are several rows of benches, for the members of the university and\r\nvisitors. Over the entrance door there is a gallery to which the public\r\nare admitted, and which, on the occasions when prizes are distributed,\r\nis usually occupied by ladies. On the walls of the Aula are hung\r\nportraits of celebrated learned men.\r\n\r\nThe National Library, situated near the convent of San Pedro, was\r\nfounded by a decree, dated the 28th of August, 1821. The books belonging\r\nto the university of San Marcos formed the nucleus of the National\r\nLibrary. To them were added the libraries of several of the monasteries,\r\nsome sequestrated works, and the collections of a few private\r\nindividuals. Of these latter, the most considerable was the collection\r\nof General San Martin, and a library of 7772 volumes bequeathed,\r\ntogether with a legacy of a thousand dollars, by Don Miguel de la Fuente\r\ny Pacheco. In November, 1841, the National Library of Peru contained\r\n26,344 printed volumes, 432 manuscripts, and a small collection of maps\r\nand copperplate engravings. It is particularly rich in old works on\r\nreligious and historical subjects. The books relating to the Conquest,\r\nand to the early period of the Spanish dominion, form in themselves a\r\ncomplete historical series. Of modern works there are but few. The\r\npecuniary support of the establishment is very inconsiderable. The\r\ngovernment exacts from it the import duty, three per cent., on European\r\nbooks, making an average annual sum of 400 dollars. In addition to this\r\nthe salaries of the librarians amount annually to 2794 dollars. The\r\nlibrary is open to the public every day (Friday and Sunday excepted)\r\nfrom eight in the morning till one in the afternoon, and from four in\r\nthe afternoon till six in the evening.\r\n\r\nIn the left wing of the same building is the museum, containing a\r\ncollection of objects of natural history, antiquities, and other\r\ncuriosities. This collection was first formed in the year 1826, in some\r\nof the spare rooms of the palace of the Inquisition, and was afterwards\r\nremoved from one place to another, until at length the government\r\nallotted to the purpose the two fine apartments in the building above\r\nmentioned. As yet the establishment is quite in its infancy. It contains\r\nnothing of scientific value, and but for the series of historical\r\nportraits already described, it would differ but little from the\r\ncollections of curiosities frequently formed by amateurs, in which all\r\nsorts of heterogeneous objects are jumbled together. The museum of Lima\r\nbids fair to remain for some time to come on the footing on which it was\r\nwhen I saw it, for the establishment has no funds, save a monthly\r\nallowance of thirty-two dollars, and out of that scanty pittance the\r\nexpense of fitting up the rooms, the glass cases, &c., has yet to be\r\ndefrayed. The museum is open to the public four days in the week.\r\n\r\nTwo other apartments in the same building are set aside for the Academy\r\nof Design (_Academia de Debujo_). On three evenings every week pupils\r\nare admitted to this academy to receive gratuitous instruction in\r\ndrawing. The number of the pupils amounts to between 80 and 100; but\r\nthere is convenient room for 200. The collection of models and drawing\r\ncopies for the use of the students is but indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe mint is situated in the vicinity of the Plazuela de la\r\nIndependencia. It was founded in Lima in the year 1565; in 1572\r\ntransferred to Potosi, and in 1683 removed back to Lima. For the space\r\nof seventy years this establishment was in the hands of private\r\nindividuals; but in the year 1753 the Spanish government took the\r\nmanagement of it, and erected the building in which it is still\r\nlocated. It is a large and handsome structure, but very defective in\r\nits internal arrangement. Until the year 1817 the machinery for\r\ncasting was worked by mules, ninety-two of those animals being\r\nemployed daily. Subsequently, under the direction of an Englishman,\r\nwater-power was introduced, by which expense was diminished and time\r\nsaved. A few years ago a French merchant made an arrangement with the\r\ngovernment for the use of a complex machine, which he proposed to\r\nbring from Europe. The machine arrived, but by an unlucky fatality it\r\nproved perfectly useless. For the space of four years repeated\r\nattempts were made to work it, but in vain; it fulfilled none of the\r\nrequired conditions. Its faults are manifold, and it reflects but\r\nlittle credit on the person by whom it was contrived. It has cost no\r\nless than 250,000 dollars, and has never been of the least use.\r\n\r\nIn the mint of Lima there are annually cast from two to two and a half\r\nmillions of dollars, which yield a profit of from 140,000 to 180,000\r\ndollars, out of which are paid the salaries of the persons employed.\r\nUnder the Spanish government these salaries amounted annually to\r\n48,906 dollars; now they make, together with other customary outlays,\r\nthe sum of 85,105 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe value of a mark of silver in the mint is 8 dollars 4 reales; that of\r\na mark of gold is 144 dollars 4 reales. The standard worth of the gold\r\nis 21 carats; that of the silver 20 grains.\r\n\r\nNext to the arena for bull-fights, situated in the Plaza firme del Acho,\r\nthe theatre is the principal place of public amusement in Lima. The\r\nfirst theatre, erected in the year 1602, was situated near the convent\r\nof San Augustin, in the street which still bears the name of \"Comedia\r\nvieja.\" It was destroyed in the earthquake of 1630, and rebuilt on the\r\nsame site. In 1662 it was pulled down to make room for a new street, and\r\nafterwards the present building was erected. Its external appearance is\r\nvery ugly and the interior is not much better. Before the orchestra\r\nthere are some commodious inclosed seats or stalls. The boxes, which are\r\ncompletely separated one from another by partitions, are narrow but\r\ndeep: the smaller ones are capable of containing eight persons, and the\r\nlarger ones twelve. In the centre of the first tier of boxes, and\r\nfronting the stage, is the government box, which occupies the space of\r\ntwo of the others. It contains seats for the prefect, the sub-prefect,\r\nand the members of the Cabildo. The president's box is likewise on the\r\nfirst tier, and on the left of the stage. Adjoining it there is a small\r\ncabinet, closed on the side next the pit by a wooden railing. Into this\r\ncabinet the president retires between the acts of the performance. The\r\nstage is small, and the scenery very indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe performances are for the most part wretched, both as regards the\r\nmerit of the pieces and the talent of the actors. Nothing can be in\r\nworse taste than the little farces called saynetes, which, according to\r\nSpanish custom, always close the performances, whether the principal\r\npiece be a tragedy or a comedy. Common-place intrigues form the subjects\r\nof these _saynetes_, and their dialogue consists of vulgar jokes. They\r\nare altogether calculated to banish any gratifying impression which\r\nmight by possibility be produced by the principal piece.\r\n\r\nFor some years past a company of Italians, settled in Lima, have given\r\noperatic performances on a small scale. One of them, Signora\r\nPantanelli, is an excellent singer, and would be heard with pleasure\r\neven in Europe. Some other members of the company have middling talents,\r\nbut the rest are decidedly bad. The operas performed are Giulietta y\r\nRomeo, Parisina, Lucia di Lammermuir, Marino Faliero, La Sonnambula, and\r\nIl Barbiere di Seviglia: these, together with a mutilated Norma, and a\r\nmuch curtailed Semiramide, form almost the whole repertory. Want of\r\nstage room is an obstacle to the representation of operas demanding\r\ngrand scenery and machinery. The costumes are for the most part\r\nexceedingly elegant, though seldom historically correct. The orchestra\r\nis defective, and ought to be much improved, to give satisfaction to a\r\npublic passionately fond of music.\r\n\r\nBut if the inhabitants of Lima are great lovers of music, dancing has no\r\nless powerful attractions for them. Though the time is gone, when the\r\ndress of any opera-dancer may be expected to reach below the knee, yet\r\nthe drapery of a Limanese Terpsichore appears to have attained even an\r\nultra degree of curtailment. The representation of ballets, properly so\r\ncalled, is not attempted; but the Bolero, the Fandango, the Cachucha,\r\nand Don Mateo, are favorite and often repeated performances.\r\n\r\nDuring the long intervals between the acts, smoking is permitted in the\r\npit and in the outer court of the theatre. There is also a plentiful\r\nsupply of very bad and very dear refreshments.\r\n\r\nAn intolerable annoyance experienced in visiting the theatre at Lima is\r\ncaused by the swarms of fleas which infest every part of the house, but\r\nmost especially the boxes. Unfortunately, this nuisance is irremediable,\r\nand the visitor must be blessed with a large amount of endurance who can\r\npatiently sit out a whole evening's entertainments.\r\n\r\nNot far from the theatre is situated the circus for cock-fighting\r\n(_Coliseo de gallos_), where fights (_peleas_) take place daily. The\r\nColiseo is a large amphitheatre, with an arena in the middle. The\r\ngame-cocks trained for this sport have the spur removed from the right\r\nfoot and in its stead is substituted a small sharp steel blade, curved\r\nand shaped like a scythe. One or other of the animals is frequently\r\nkilled at the first spring; and when that is not the case they continue\r\nfighting until they die of wounds and exhaustion. It is a cruel sport,\r\nand a worthy pendant to bull-fighting. The first Coliseo was erected in\r\n1762, by Don Juan Garrial. The present building, in the Plazuela de\r\nSanta Catalina, is a very handsome structure, and Lima may fairly boast\r\nof possessing the finest circus for cock-fighting in all the world.\r\n\r\nIn the same square with the _Coliseo de gallos_ is the tennis-court,\r\na spacious area, surrounded by high walls. It is not now so much\r\nresorted to as formerly, for the Creoles are not so fond of tennis\r\nas the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nA beautiful stone bridge unites the town with the suburb of San\r\nLazaro. This bridge was built in the years 1638-1640, when the Marquis\r\nde Montes Claros was viceroy of Peru. The plan was designed by Fray\r\nGeronimo Villegas, an Augustine monk. It is 530 feet long, and has six\r\narches rising thirty-seven feet above the surface of the water. The\r\nfoundation of the piers is composed of square blocks of stone, the\r\npiers themselves are of brick, and the parapet of cemented stone work.\r\nThe erection of this bridge cost 400,000 dollars. A sufficient proof\r\nof its strength and solidity is the fact that it survived the\r\nearthquakes of 1687 and 1746, which shattered all other parts of Lima.\r\nIn the earthquake of 1746 the first arch, on which stood an equestrian\r\nstatue of Philip V., was destroyed, but it is now restored. It has on\r\none side two towers, with a dial in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe city of Lima, with the exception of a portion of the north side,\r\nand the suburb of San Lazaro, is surrounded by a wall built of brick.\r\nThis wall was constructed in the year 1585, when the Duque de la Plata\r\nwas viceroy. It is the work of a Fleming, named Pedro Ramon. This wall\r\nis between eighteen and twenty feet high. Its breadth at the base is\r\nfrom ten to twelve feet, and at the top nine feet. It does not\r\ntherefore afford sufficient space for mounting large guns. Along the\r\nwhole extent of the wall there are thirty-four bastions. In the year\r\n1807, this wall, which had fallen into a very ruinous condition, was\r\nrepaired by order of the viceroy Abascal, and put into a condition to\r\nbe mounted with artillery. On each side commodious pathways were made,\r\nand along the inner side powder magazines were constructed. At present\r\nthese fortifications are in a state of complete dilapidation. The\r\npaths, which are obstructed by rubbish, are almost impassable, and\r\nthe powder magazines are destroyed. The city wall of Lima has nine\r\ngates (_Portadas_). Of these, six only are now open, viz., the\r\nPortadas of Maravillas, Barbones, Cocharcas, Guadelupe, Juan Simon,\r\nand Callao; the three others, the Portadas of Martinete, Monserrat,\r\nand Santa Catalina, are walled up. At every one of the open gates\r\nthere are stationed custom-house guards, whose chief duty consists in\r\npreventing the smuggled introduction of unstamped silver (_plata de\r\npiña_). In the direction of the suburb of San Lazaro, the city cannot\r\nbe closed, as the wall does not extend to that part. Between San\r\nLazaro, and the high road to Cero de Pasco, is the _Portada de Guias_;\r\nthis, however, is not properly a gate, but a small custom-house. In\r\nthis direction it is easy to gain entrance to the city from the river,\r\nand consequently it is here that most of the contraband silver,\r\nbrought from the mountains, is smuggled.\r\n\r\nAmong the fortifications of Lima may be included the pretty little\r\ncastle of Santa Catalina, situated at the eastern end of the city,\r\nbetween the Portada de Cocharcas and the Portada de Guadelupe, at the\r\ndistance of about two hundred yards from the city wall. It is\r\nsurrounded by rather high walls, and is flanked by two bastions. The\r\ninterior of this citadel is very well arranged, and is kept much\r\ncleaner than such places usually are in Peru. It contains stores of\r\narms and barracks for the artillery. The largest barracks in Lima are\r\nthose of the infantry, _Quartel de Infanteria_, in the Colegio. They\r\nare remarkable for want of cleanliness, and like most of the public\r\nbuildings in this interesting city, going fast to decay.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The city of Lima was founded by Don Francisco Pizarro on\r\nthe 6th of January, 1534.

It is curious\r\nto mark the progressive changes of costume, and to observe the various\r\nphysiognomies, especially if we reflect on the history of the men whose\r\ntraits denote such striking differences of character. Almost all these\r\nportraits are distinguished by an air of tranquil gravity which in some\r\nis combined with true kingly dignity, and in others with an expression\r\nof fierceness. The handsomest head of the whole series is decidedly\r\nthat of Francisco Pizarro. His features bear the stamp of manly energy,\r\nand his whole countenance is characterized by courage and candor. The\r\nnose has the prominent Arabic form, and the forehead is high and\r\nexpanded. The thick beard, covering the mouth and chin, gives a gloomy\r\nand resolute character to the face.

In the year 1764 the number of the inhabitants was stated\r\nto be 54,000; in 1810, 87,000; in 1826, 70,000; in 1836, 54,600; and in\r\n1842, 53,000. Of most of these estimates I entertain some degree of\r\ndistrust, as they are merely founded on general calculations, and are\r\nnot the results of careful numbering. Certain it is, however, that the\r\npopulation of Lima has very considerably decreased since the declaration\r\nof independence. This is sufficiently proved by the fact that several\r\nparts of the city are now totally uninhabited: the houses falling to\r\ndecay, and the gardens lying waste.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this diminished population is easily explained by the\r\nphysical and political condition of the country. Earthquakes have, at\r\nvarious times, buried thousands of people beneath the ruins of their own\r\ndwellings; the war of independence was attended by vast sacrifices of\r\nlife; banishment and voluntary emigration have removed from Lima the\r\nfamilies of some of the principal citizens; and epidemic disease, the\r\nnatural consequence of defective police regulations, has swept away\r\ncountless multitudes of the inhabitants. The number of new settlers is\r\nvery inconsiderable; and for several past years the number of deaths\r\nhas nearly doubled that of the births. There appears no reason to doubt\r\nthat this decrease of population will continue; because, as will\r\npresently be seen, the causes to which it is assignable cannot be\r\nchecked, inasmuch as they are intimately blended with the character of\r\nthe nation. Most of these causes operate not only in the capital, but\r\nover the whole country; indeed, in the latter their influence is in some\r\ninstances much greater; for example, in the interior of Peru the loss of\r\nlife attendant on the war was relatively much greater than in Lima. This\r\nfavored country, which extends from the 3d to the 22d degree of south\r\nlatitude, and which contained at the time of its conquest by the\r\nSpaniards an immense population, though its amount is not known with\r\nnumerical exactitude, now counts only 1,400,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn the tax registers, drawn up during the protectorate of Santa Cruz,\r\nin 1836, the number of the inhabitants of Lima is represented as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             Male.    Female.   Total.\r\n\r\n  1. White Creoles (being the\r\n       descendants of foreigners,\r\n       but chiefly of Spaniards)             9,423    10,170    19,593\r\n\r\n  2. Indians                                 2,561     2,731     5,292\r\n\r\n  3. People of Color (mixed races)          11,771    12,355    24,126\r\n\r\n  4. Slaves                                  2,186     3,606     4,792\r\n\r\n  5. Ecclesiastics (Lay and Monastic)          475       350       825\r\n                                            ------    ------    ------\r\n       In all                               26,416    29,212    54,628\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the above it appears that in every class (No. 5 excepted) there is\r\na preponderance of females; and that on the whole population of 54,628\r\nindividuals there is a surplus of 2796 women. About one in every\r\nsixty-six individuals belongs to the priesthood.\r\n\r\nPossibly in no other place in the world is there so much variety of\r\ncomplexion and physiognomy as in Lima. From the delicately fair creole\r\ndaughter of European parents, to the jet black Congo negro, people of\r\nevery gradation of color are seen living in intimate relation one with\r\nanother. The two extreme classes--the whites and blacks--are as\r\ndistinct in character as in color, and of either of those it is no\r\ndifficult task to give an accurate portraiture. But it is different\r\nwith the mixed races. To define their characteristics correctly would\r\nbe impossible, for their minds partake of the mixture of their blood.\r\nAs a general rule, it may fairly be said that they unite in themselves\r\nall the faults, without any of the virtues, of their progenitors. As\r\nmen they are greatly inferior to the pure races, and as members of\r\nsociety they are the worst class of citizens. Here, as well as in the\r\nfollowing delineations of the different races, I wish my observations\r\nto be understood only in a general sense. I have met with some\r\nhonorable exceptions; though, unfortunately, they were mere solitary\r\nluminaries, whose transient light has been speedily obscured by\r\nthe surrounding darkness.\r\n\r\nThe white Creoles, who, with very few exceptions, are the descendants of\r\nSpaniards, constitute somewhat less than a third part of the population\r\nof Lima. They are slender in figure and of middling height. Their\r\nfeatures are strongly marked, their complexions fair and pale, and their\r\nhair is of the darkest black. The men are feeble and look prematurely\r\nold. Their countenances, though not devoid of dignity, have a sort of\r\nsensual expression. They are effeminate, and disinclined to any kind of\r\nactive exertion. If they ride the distance of ten miles, they think they\r\nhave performed a feat of heroism worthy to be recorded in the state\r\narchives. If the white Creoles are inferior to the Spaniards in physical\r\norganization, they are no less beneath them in qualities of mind. They\r\nshrink from anything that demands intellectual exertion. In short, they\r\nare sworn enemies to business of every kind, and those who are obliged\r\nto work for their own support, make choice of some occupation which,\r\nlike that of a shopman, affords them ample time to smoke cigars and to\r\ngossip with their neighbors. The richer classes give themselves up\r\nwholly to idleness. They walk about and visit their acquaintances, or\r\nthey lounge in shops or at the corners of streets, and in that manner\r\nthey often amuse themselves for half a day. Those who are owners of\r\nplantations occasionally ride through them to receive reports from their\r\nmayordomos. Their afternoons are usually spent in the _Coliseo de\r\ngallos_, in the coffee-houses, or at the gaming-table. The white Creoles\r\nare as passionately fond of gaming as the Spaniards, and sums equal to\r\nthose staked at the gaming-tables of Mexico and the Havannah are daily\r\nlost and won in Lima. Though games of hazard are prohibited, yet they\r\nare very publicly played, and it is only now and then that the police\r\nenforce the regulations of the law by the seizure of a bank.\r\n\r\nGaming in Lima is carried on very quietly, and the most determined\r\ngamblers do not show themselves very much excited either by losses or\r\nwinnings. The discovery of false dice, however, creates bitter feelings\r\nof animosity, which not unfrequently lead to assassination. Of this I\r\nknew several instances when I was in the interior of the country.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual culture of the white Creole of Lima is exceedingly\r\ndefective. He is not wanting in talent; but an imperfect system of\r\neducation affords him no opportunity for the development of his\r\nfaculties, and innate indolence is a bar to his self-improvement by\r\nstudy. He seldom rises above the level of every-day life, and is\r\nignorant of everything beyond the boundary of the city, or, at all\r\nevents, of the province in which he was born. I have often been amazed\r\nat the monstrous ignorance of so-called educated Peruvians, respecting\r\nthe situation, the extent, the physical formation, and the productions\r\nof their native country.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must not be forgotten that Lima has been the\r\nbirthplace of several white Creoles, whose talents and learning have\r\nhonorably distinguished them from the rest of their countrymen. For\r\nexample, Don Tomas de Salazar, author of the \"Interpretaciones de los\r\nLeyes de Indias.\"[13] Don Miguel Nuñez de Rojas, the learned Judge of\r\nConfiscations in the Spanish war of succession, and Don Alonzo Conde de\r\nSan Donas, who in the reign of Philip IV. was Spanish Ambassador at the\r\nCourt of France. Among those eminent in literature may be named Don\r\nPedro de la Reyna Maldonado, and the poet Don Diego Martinez de Rivera,\r\nof whom Cervantes in his \"Galatea\" says--\r\n\r\n    Su divina ingenio ha producido\r\n    En Arequipa eterna Primavera.[14]\r\n\r\nSeveral monks distinguished for learning have been white Creoles,\r\nand an eminent individual of that race was Don Hipolito Unanue, the\r\nauthor of the \"Guide to Peru,\" and \"Observations on the Climate of\r\nLima, and its Influence on organized Beings, especially Man;\"[15] a\r\nTreatise on the Cocoa-tree, &c. In more recent times, Don Mariano\r\nEduardo de Rivero has zealously devoted himself to the study of\r\nnatural history and antiquities.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his faults, the Lima Creole has his good qualities.\r\nHe is an enemy to strong drinks. When he takes wine it is usually of\r\nsome sweet kind, and of that he partakes very sparingly. A white\r\nCreole in a state of intoxication would, indeed, be a rare sight. Not\r\nso in the interior of the country, where the whites are remarkable\r\nfor intemperate drinking.\r\n\r\nFar superior to the men, both physically and intellectually, are the\r\nwomen of Lima. Nature has lavishly endowed them with many of her\r\nchoicest gifts. In figure they are usually slender and rather tall, and\r\nthey are especially remarkable for small, elegantly formed feet. Their\r\nfair faces, from which the glowing breath of the tropics banishes every\r\ntrace of bloom, are animated by large, bright, dark eyes. Their features\r\nare pleasing--the nose being well formed, though in general not\r\nsmall--the mouth invariably adorned with two rows of brilliant white\r\nteeth,[16] and their long black hair, arranged in plaits, falls\r\ngracefully over the bosom and shoulders. Add to all this a captivating\r\ngrace of manner and deportment, joined to an exceeding degree of\r\ngentleness and amiability, and it will be readily admitted that the\r\nLimena is a noble specimen of female loveliness.\r\n\r\nAt home, especially in the summer season, the ladies of Lima dress\r\nlightly and even negligently. For visiting, or going to the theatres,\r\nthey adopt the French fashion. When walking in the streets, attending\r\nchurch, joining religious processions, &c., they appear in a very\r\nsingular costume, peculiar to Lima, and consisting of two garments\r\ncalled the _Saya_ and the _Manto_. Of the saya there are two kinds.\r\nThe one called the _Saya ajustada_, was formerly in general use, but\r\nis now seldom seen. It consists of a petticoat, or skirt of thick\r\nstiff silk, plaited at top and bottom, in small fluted folds, drawn\r\nvery close together at the waist and widening towards the ankles,\r\nbeneath which the saya does not descend. It is tight to the form, the\r\noutline of which it perfectly displays, and its closeness to the\r\nlimbs naturally impedes rapid movement. When wearing the _Saya\r\najustada_, the ladies find it no very easy task to kneel down at\r\nchurch, and at the termination of every genuflexion, they are obliged\r\nto twist and twirl about for a considerable time before they can\r\nagain stand on their feet.[17]\r\n\r\nThe other description of saya is called the Saya _culeça_, or the\r\n_Saya desplegada_. It is plaited close at the waist, and from thence\r\ndownwards it stands out like a hooped petticoat. This sort of saya is\r\nmade by first being plaited both at top and bottom like the _Saya\r\najustada_; but, afterwards, the lower plaits are undone to form the\r\n_Saya desplegada_. The saya is always made of some dark-colored silk,\r\nblack, green, blue, or cinnamon color.\r\n\r\nThe _Manto_ is a veil of thick black silk fastened by a band at the back\r\nof the waist, where it joins the _saya_. From thence it is brought over\r\nthe shoulders and head, and drawn over the face so closely that only a\r\nsmall triangular space, sufficient for one eye to peep through, is left\r\nuncovered. A rich shawl thrown over the shoulders conceals the whole of\r\nthe under garment, except the sleeves. One of the small, neatly-gloved\r\nhands, confines the folds of the _manto_, whilst the other holds a\r\nrichly embroidered pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\nAt first sight this costume has a very singular effect, and it is\r\nlong before the eye of a foreigner becomes reconciled to it. The\r\nnarrow saya is by no means graceful; the wide saya, on the other hand,\r\nis very becoming, and sets off to great advantage a good figure and\r\nelegant deportment. When I first arrived in Lima and saw the ladies\r\nclosely muffled up in their _mantos_, and carrying embroidered cambric\r\nhandkerchiefs and nosegays in their hands, it struck me that the nuns\r\nenjoyed greater freedom in that country than in any other part of the\r\nworld. After vespers, that is to say half-past seven in the evening,\r\nthe police regulations prohibit any woman from appearing in the\r\nstreets dressed in the saya.\r\n\r\nAs this garment may be worn over a dress of the ordinary kind, it is\r\nfound to be very convenient, inasmuch as it saves the trouble of a\r\ncareful toilette. During short visits the ladies do not take off the\r\nsaya; but when making long visits they usually lay it aside.\r\n\r\nThe Saya y Manto are found to be very useful auxiliaries in the numerous\r\nintrigues in which the Limeñas frequently engage.\r\n\r\nA _Tapada_[18] indulges in a vast deal of freedom when in the streets,\r\nand scruples not to make satirical observations on anybody or anything\r\nthat strikes her as strange or ludicrous. The veil, or manto, is sacred,\r\nand should a man attempt to remove it by force, he would run the risk of\r\nbeing severely handled by the populace.\r\n\r\nIn intrigues of gallantry the Saya y Manto play a conspicuous part. A\r\nlady has been known to arrange an assignation with a gentleman in the\r\nstreet, whilst her husband, standing at the distance of a few yards\r\nand conversing with a friend on some matter of business, has little\r\nsuspected that the _Tapada_ whose graceful figure he admired, was his\r\nown faithful better-half. It frequently happens that Doña Mariquita\r\nobliges Doña Merceditas, or Doña Panchita, with the loan of her saya,\r\nfor the purpose of hood-winking the Argus-eyes of a jealous\r\nhusband;--the lady being well convinced that her kind friends will\r\nrender her the like service in similar circumstances. Sometimes a\r\nlady may be seen in an old tattered saya, such as scarcely the poorest\r\nfemale might be expected to wear; but the costly shawl, the worked\r\npocket-handkerchief, the silk stockings, and satin shoes, betray the\r\nrank of the _Tapada_, and plainly denote that she has sallied forth on\r\nan adventure. It is difficult, nay almost impossible, to recognize a\r\nlady thus muffled up. The one eye alone visible, is, as may be\r\nsupposed, a very uncertain token of identity, and the figure and walk\r\nmay be easily disguised.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be supposed that these concealments sometimes occasion\r\nmortifying mistakes. On beholding a tall slender figure whose\r\nsymmetrical contour is discernible even through the unwieldy saya, and a\r\nbright dark eye beaming beneath the folds of the manto, one may be\r\ninduced to imagine that the charms of a Hebe are concealed beneath the\r\ndisfiguring garb. But how great is the disappointment when an accidental\r\nmovement of the manto discloses the wide mouth of an ugly mulatta\r\ngrinning from ear to ear.\r\n\r\nMost foreigners who marry Limeñas stipulate that from the time of\r\nbetrothal, their wives shall no longer wear the saya y manto. The\r\ncondition is agreed to; but how far it is faithfully observed the\r\nhusbands best know. Many, no doubt, lull themselves in the confidence\r\nof their wishes being implicitly obeyed; but female ingenuity readily\r\ndevises opportunities for deception. The women of Lima never willingly\r\nrenounce the saya y manto, for it is inseparably associated with\r\ncustoms to which they are, heart and soul, devoted.\r\n\r\nIf we follow the Limeña (the white Creole, be it understood) into the\r\nretirement of domestic life, we find that she is an affectionate mother,\r\nbut not a very clever housekeeper. Every lady has at her command a great\r\nmany more domestics than are necessary: some are servants, but most of\r\nthem slaves. The establishment usually consists of a cook, a nurse-maid,\r\none or two house-maids, a needle-woman, several men-servants, and a\r\nlittle negro or Indian, whose chief business is to carry a carpet behind\r\nhis mistress when she goes to church. These servants all do as they\r\nplease, and the lady of the house concerns herself very little about the\r\nindolence which her want of vigilance encourages. She rises at a late\r\nhour, and having dressed herself and decorated her hair with sprigs of\r\njasmine and orange blossom, she takes her breakfast. That meal being\r\nended, she goes out to make visits. During the sultry hours of mid-day\r\nshe reposes, either by swinging in a hammock or reclining on a sofa, and\r\nmeanwhile smokes a cigar. After dinner she again makes visits, and the\r\nevening is spent in the theatre, on the plaza, or on the bridge. Some\r\nfew ladies employ themselves in needle-work, in which they are often\r\nmost accomplished adepts; they especially excel in embroidery and fancy\r\nwork; but they never pursue these employments before company.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Lima are passionately fond of music. Most of them play the\r\npiano-forte or the guitar, and also sing; but for want of good\r\ninstruction neither their playing nor their singing is above mediocrity.\r\nSmoking is pretty general among females, at least those of mature age;\r\nbut they indulge in this practice only in their own apartments. Of late\r\nyears the custom of smoking has been on the decline in Lima, in\r\nproportion as it has been increased on the continent of the old world.\r\nThough snuff-taking is prohibited in the convents, yet the nuns practise\r\nit to a great extent. They use an exceedingly fine kind of red snuff,\r\nwhich has the effect of closing the breathing passage through the\r\nnostrils, and of producing a peculiar nasal tone of voice.\r\n\r\nWith the ladies of Lima, vanity and the love of dress appear to have\r\nreached their climax. To this passion for personal adornment they\r\nsacrifice everything. Formerly, when none but _real_ pearls and diamonds\r\nwere worn, many a lady was known to have ruined her husband by the\r\npurchase of those costly articles; now, however, thanks to French mock\r\njewelry, they are enabled to bedeck themselves in glittering ornaments\r\nat trivial expense. Another of their passions is a fondness for\r\nperfumes. They are continually besprinkling themselves with _eau de\r\nCologne_, _esprit de Lavande_, _agua rica_, or _mistura_. The latter is\r\na fragrant yellow-colored water, prepared from gillyflower, jasmine, and\r\nflor de mistela (_Talinum umbellatum_). They perfume their apartments\r\ndaily with _Sahumerios_ (pastiles). When the lady of the house wishes to\r\nshow particular attention to her visitors, she offers them perfumed\r\nwater, dropping it into the bosoms of the ladies, and on the\r\npocket-handkerchiefs of the gentlemen. Considering their free use of\r\nperfumes, it is not surprising that the fair Limeñas should be\r\nconstantly complaining of headache, vertigo, and other nervous ailments,\r\nor, to use their own phrase (_los nervios_).\r\n\r\nAbove all things the Limeñas pride themselves in the excessive smallness\r\nof their feet. Whether walking, standing, sitting, swinging in the\r\nhammock, or reclining on the sofa, the grand object invariably is to\r\ndisplay to advantage the tiny foot. To praise her virtue, her\r\nintelligence, her wit, or even her beauty, would be less complimentary\r\nto a Limeña than to admire the elegance of her feet. All possible care\r\nis taken to preserve the small form of the foot, and the Lima ladies\r\navoid everything that may tend to spread or enlarge it. Their shoes are\r\nusually made of embroidered velvet or satin, or of very fine kid, and\r\nare so exceedingly small, that they cannot be drawn on and off without\r\ndifficulty. It is usual to have two new pairs every week, and the\r\nexpense of a lady's shoes not unfrequently amounts to two hundred\r\ndollars per annum. A large foot is a thing held in horror by the\r\nLimeñas: they call it _una pataza inglesa_ (an English paw). I once\r\nheard some Lima ladies extolling in high terms the beauty of a fair\r\nEuropean; but all their praises ended with the words:--\"Pero que pie,\r\nvalgame Dios! parece una lancha.\" (But what a foot, good Heaven! It is\r\nlike a great boat.) Yet the feet of the lady alluded to would not, in\r\nEurope, have been thought by any means large.\r\n\r\n_Gourmanderie_ is one of the evil habits of the female inhabitants of\r\nLima. Between meals they are continually eating sweetmeats and a variety\r\nof things. At one moment they order _tamal_,[19] next _omitas_,[20] then\r\n_pan de chancay_ (a sweet sort of bread), and biscuits, then _masamorita\r\nmorada_,[21] or _frijoles coladas_,[22] &c.; and yet dinner is partaken\r\nwith as hearty an appetite as though none of these interludes had been\r\nintroduced. Can it be matter of surprise that the good ladies are\r\nconstantly complaining of indigestion and _mal de estomago_?\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the houses cleanliness does not extend beyond those\r\napartments which are open to visitors, namely, the _sala_ and the\r\n_cuadro_. The other rooms of the house frequently bear more\r\nresemblance to a stable than a human habitation, and their condition\r\nreflects little credit on the domestic habits of the female inmates.\r\nBut even this is typical of the national character,--a great outward\r\nshow and little inward worth.\r\n\r\nAt first a stranger is struck with the singularity of the names of many\r\nof the women of Lima. A child receives the name of the saint or of the\r\nfestival whose celebration falls on the day of its birth. Those who\r\nhappen to come into the world on the days on which the Romish Church\r\ncelebrates the several manifestations of the Virgin receive the most\r\nextraordinary names. For example, a child born on the anniversary day of\r\nthe manifestation to St. Francis on the Snow Mountain, is named _Nièves_\r\n(snow). _Pilar_ (fountain-basin) is another strange name, conferred in\r\nhonor of the manifestation of the Virgin at the Fountains in Saragossa.\r\nThen there are _Conceptions_, _Natividads_, and _Asuncions_, without\r\nnumber. A girl born on Candlemas-day is named _Candelaria_, and one born\r\non the first day of the year receives the name of Jesus. The singular\r\neffect of these names is heightened by the Spanish custom of using\r\ndiminutives, formed by adding to the name the particle _ito_ or _ita_,\r\nthe former being the masculine, the latter the feminine. It may be\r\nreadily imagined that a foreigner is not a little startled on hearing a\r\nyoung lady called Doña Jesusita. In some names the diminutive takes a\r\nform totally different from the full name; as, for example, Panchita for\r\nFrancisca, Pepita for Josefa, Conchita for Concepcion. A married woman\r\ndoes not take the family name of her husband, but retains her own,\r\nadding to it her husband's name preceded by the particle _de_, as, for\r\nexample, Doña Maria Juana Rodriguez de Salazar.\r\n\r\nOn attaining a certain age, the Limeñas totally alter their habits of\r\nlife. When their beauty fades, and they cease to be the objects of\r\ncompliment and flattery; or when weary of an idle, luxurious, and, in\r\ntoo many instances, a no very virtuous life, they betake themselves to\r\npiety, and become _Beatas_.[23] The Limeña who thus renounces the\r\nvanities of the world attends church two or three times every day,\r\nconfesses at least once every week, retires during Lent to a house of\r\npenitence; fasts, prays, and receives the visits of her confessor, to\r\nwhom she sends presents of sweetmeats;--and should the holy man, as is\r\nusually the case, prefer riding to walking, she shows her piety by\r\ngiving him the use of her _Calesa_ to convey him from place to place.\r\n\r\nThe women of Lima are gifted by nature with extraordinary natural\r\ntalent, though unfortunately it is rarely cultivated. They possess\r\nshrewd and penetrating intelligence, clear judgment, and in general\r\nvery just views on the ordinary affairs of life. Like the women of the\r\nsouthern provinces of Spain, they are remarkable for quickness and\r\nsmartness of repartee, and in a wordy contest a Limeña is sure to come\r\noff triumphant. They have a great deal of decision of character, and a\r\ndegree of courage which does not usually fall to the lot of the female\r\nsex. In these respects they are infinitely superior to the timid,\r\nspiritless men. In the various political revolutions of the country,\r\nthe women have often taken an active, and, in some instances, a more\r\ndecided part than the men.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in Lima form but a small portion of the population, being\r\nabout 5000 in number. Among them are as many emigrants as natives. Most\r\nof the former are from the mountainous districts, and but few are from\r\nplaces on the coast. Their character is, of course, much modified by\r\ncontinual intercourse with the whites; but I will endeavor to describe\r\nthem as they show themselves in their original purity, marking the\r\ndistinctions observable between the _Indio Costeño_ (the Coast\r\nIndian), and the _Indio Serrano_ (the mountain Indian). The Indians in\r\nLima are active and industrious. Many of them are shopkeepers, and by\r\nthe integrity of their dealings they stand on a footing of good credit\r\nwith the great commercial houses. Those who are employed as servants\r\nare less remarkable for industry and honesty. They are reserved and\r\nsuspicious; qualities especially observable when they have but\r\nrecently emigrated into Lima. They combine personal vanity with an\r\ninconceivable degree of dirtiness. Their intellectual faculties are\r\nfar beneath those of the white Creoles, of whom they stand in a\r\ndegree of fear, which is not easily eradicated.\r\n\r\nAt a former period there existed in Lima a college exclusively for\r\nnoble-born Indians; and the eldest sons of the families descended\r\nfrom the Incas, when they wished to study, were received at the\r\nexpense of the State into the College of San Carlos; but since the\r\ndeclaration of independence, all the privileges enjoyed by the\r\nIndians have been annulled.\r\n\r\nThe negroes in Lima form one-fifth part of the population. Their\r\nnumber amounts to upwards of 10,000, of which 4800 are slaves. Though\r\nan article in the Charter of Independence declares that \"in Peru no\r\nperson is born a slave,\" yet the National Congress has on various\r\noccasions thought fit to deviate from this principle. In Huaura it was\r\ndecreed that children born in slavery shall be free on attaining the\r\nage of twenty-five, and the Congress of Huancayo prolonged the period\r\nto fifty years. There are no new importations of negroes from Africa,\r\nfor an article in the Charter just mentioned sets forth that \"every\r\nperson who may be brought, as a slave, from another country to Peru,\r\nis free from the moment when he sets foot on the soil of that\r\nrepublic.\" Accordingly, if a Peruvian take his slave with him on a\r\njourney to Chile, and brings him back again, the slave may, on his\r\nreturn, claim his freedom. The only exception to this rule refers to\r\nrunaway negroes, who, even after years of absence, may be reclaimed on\r\ntheir return. The value of slaves is not so high in Peru as in the\r\nsouthern states of North America. In Lima, the average price of a\r\nyoung, strong, and healthy negro is 400 dollars; the price of a\r\nnegress, especially a _Negra de Chavra_ (capable of field work), is\r\n100 dollars higher. The value of those destined for domestic service\r\ndepends on character and qualifications. A negress who is a good cook\r\nor needlewoman, is of course worth more than a negro who is to be\r\nemployed as a water-carrier or a footman. In the plantations their\r\nvalue depends wholly on health and strength.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of slaves in Lima, especially by the Creoles, is\r\nexceedingly mild, and generally much on the same footing as the\r\ntreatment of servants in Europe. It is seldom that a master inflicts\r\nsevere corporal chastisement on a slave. If the latter requires\r\npunishment, he is sent into the _Panaderia_ (the bakehouse) to knead the\r\ndough and bake the bread, which work they perform under the supervision\r\nof a Mayordomo, who is usually a hard task-master. Owing to the heat of\r\nthe climate, working in the _Panaderia_ is more feared by the slaves\r\nthan any other kind of punishment.\r\n\r\nIn Lima the special laws for the protection of slaves are more\r\nfavorable to them than the similar laws of any other slave country.\r\nThe slaves bring their complaints before a particular judge, whose\r\nbusiness it is to protect them against ill-treatment. A slave is free\r\nwhenever he can pay the sum which his master demands for him,--which\r\nsum, in disputed cases, is fixed by legal decision. The slave also\r\npossesses the right of selling himself to another master, and the\r\nlatter may pay the purchase-money to the former owner, who, however\r\nunwillingly, is obliged to conclude the bargain. The negroes have\r\nample opportunities for saving money. They are permitted, during five\r\nor six hours of the day, to work for themselves; so that in the course\r\nof a few years they may with ease save the sum requisite for\r\npurchasing their independence. But in general they spend their\r\nearnings in mere idle enjoyments, and care but little about obtaining\r\ntheir freedom. As slaves they are provided with lodging, food, and\r\nclothing, and they are nursed in sickness; but as soon as they become\r\nfree, they must supply all these wants for themselves; an undertaking\r\nwhich their natural indolence renders them little inclined to. On the\r\nwhole, domestic negroes may be said to be willing slaves; it is\r\npossibly different with those employed in the plantations, who are\r\nliable to harder work and harsher treatment. I knew an old negro, who\r\nhad hoarded up 6000 dollars, and yet did not purchase his own\r\nfreedom, though he had paid for the liberation of his children and\r\nhis two sisters. He often observed to me, that he should not be half\r\nso well off if he were free.\r\n\r\nThe negroes brought from Africa, who are called _Bosales_, are far\r\nbetter than the Creole negroes. In physical strength they are inferior\r\nto the latter, and are less lively; yet they are patient, and much more\r\nfaithful and attached to their masters than the Creole negroes born in\r\nPeru. The Bosales all have a certain degree of pride, but especially\r\nthose who are of princely blood. A gentleman of old Spain bought a\r\nyoung negro princess, who not without the greatest difficulty could be\r\nbrought to perform the duties of servitude. When she was directed to go\r\nto market, she set her basket down on the ground, and signified that she\r\nhad been accustomed to be served, and not to serve. Some chastisement\r\nwas resorted to, with the view of compelling her to do the duty allotted\r\nto her; but in vain. Her pride and obstinacy remained unconquerable.\r\nSometimes she would sit for hours gloomily, with her eyes fixed on the\r\nground, and muttering between her teeth, in her broken Spanish, the\r\nwords, \"_Yo clavita! yo clavita!_\"[24] Then suddenly springing up, she\r\nwould strike her head against the wall until she became almost\r\nsenseless. As she showed a fondness for the children of the family, she\r\nwas relieved from household work, and became the nursery-maid. In that\r\nway she discharged the duties which devolved on her with the most\r\ntouching affection and fidelity; but she never would do anything,\r\nhowever trivial, which she considered to be menial service, and her\r\nmaster and mistress were reasonable enough not to require it.\r\n\r\nWhen the number of the African negroes in Lima was more considerable\r\nthan it now is, the various races kept together, and formed\r\nthemselves into unions, called _Cofradias_. They used to meet\r\ntogether at regular periods. At these meetings the negroes of\r\nprincely descent were treated with marks of respect which they could\r\nscarcely have received in their native home. Speeches were delivered,\r\nand religious ceremonies performed; whilst music, singing, and\r\ndancing, revived recollections of past happiness, and of the\r\nfar-distant native land. These Cofradias were also conducive to\r\nphilanthropic ends; for when a slave had a hard master, the sum\r\nrequisite for purchasing his freedom was raised by a general\r\nsubscription in the union to which he belonged. Since the\r\nindependence of Peru, and the consequent prohibition of the\r\nimportation of negroes, the Cofradias have declined, and have lost\r\nmuch of their original character. Creoles and free negroes have now\r\nbecome members of them. The places in which these meetings are held\r\nare situated in the suburb of San Lazaro. The walls of the rooms\r\nare painted with grotesque figures of negro kings, elephants,\r\ncamels, palm trees, &c.\r\n\r\nIn Lima, and indeed throughout the whole of Peru, the free negroes are a\r\nplague to society. Too indolent to support themselves by laborious\r\nindustry, they readily fall into any dishonest means of getting money.\r\nAlmost all the robbers who infest the roads on the coast of Peru are\r\nfree negroes. Dishonesty seems to be a part of their very nature; and\r\nmoreover, all their tastes and inclinations are coarse and sensual. Many\r\nwarm defenders of the negroes excuse these qualities by ascribing them\r\nto the want of education, the recollection of slavery, the spirit of\r\nrevenge, &c. But I here speak of free-born negroes, who are admitted\r\ninto the houses of wealthy families, who from their early childhood have\r\nreceived as good an education as falls to the share of many of the white\r\nCreoles--who are treated with kindness and liberally remunerated, and\r\nyet they do not differ from their half-savage brethren who are shut out\r\nfrom these advantages. If the negro has learned to read and write, and\r\nthereby made some little advance in education, he is transformed into a\r\nconceited coxcomb, who, instead of plundering travellers on the highway,\r\nfinds in city life a sphere for the indulgence of his evil propensities.\r\nWhat is the cause of this incorrigible turpitude of the negroes? To\r\nanswer this important question is not easy, if we admit the principle\r\nthat the negro is as capable of cultivation as the Caucasian; and in\r\nsupport of it the names of some highly-educated Ethiopians may be cited.\r\nThose who are disposed to maintain this principle, and who are at the\r\nsame time intimately acquainted with the social relations of the\r\ncountries in which free negroes are numerous, may solve the problem. My\r\nopinion is, that the negroes, in respect to capability for mental\r\nimprovement, are far behind the Europeans, and that, considered in the\r\naggregate, they will not, even with the advantages of careful education,\r\nattain a very high degree of cultivation; because the structure of the\r\nnegro skull, on which depends the development of the brain, approximates\r\nclosely to the animal form. The imitative faculty of the monkey is\r\nhighly developed in the negro, who readily seizes anything merely\r\nmechanical, whilst things demanding intelligence are beyond his reach.\r\nSensuality is the impulse which controls the thoughts, the acts, the\r\nwhole existence of the negroes. To them freedom can be only nominal; for\r\nif they conduct themselves well it is because they are compelled, not\r\nbecause they are inclined to do so. Herein lie at once the cause of, and\r\nthe apology for, their bad character.\r\n\r\nThe negro women differ but little from the men, in their general\r\ncharacteristics. They are, however, more active and industrious, and\r\nbetter tempered. As domestic servants they are superior to the mixed\r\nraces. They are much employed as nurses, and in those situations they\r\ndischarge their duties well. Their personal vanity is boundless, and\r\nevery real they can save is spent in dress and ornaments. It is amusing\r\nto see them, on festival days, parading about the streets, dressed in\r\nwhite muslin gowns trimmed with lace, and short sleeves displaying their\r\nblack arms. Very short petticoats, seldom extending below the ankle,\r\nserve to exhibit the tawdry finery of red silk stockings and light blue\r\nsatin shoes. From their ears are suspended long gold drops, and their\r\nuncovered necks are not unfrequently adorned with costly necklaces. A\r\nnegress, who was a slave belonging to a family of my acquaintance,\r\npossessed a necklace composed of fine Panama pearls, worth several\r\nthousand dollars. The pure white of the pearls was wonderfully\r\nheightened by the contrast of the jet-black skin of the wearer; and for\r\nthis reason they were more ornamental to the negress than they would\r\nhave been to the fairest lady in Europe.\r\n\r\nHaving noticed the principal races, we will now consider the variegated\r\nmass of people of mixed blood, who in Lima form a considerable portion\r\nof the population. Stevenson[25] gives a long list of these mixed races,\r\nand specifies the proportionate degree, that is to say, how many eighths\r\nor sixteenths of black, brown, or white color belong to each. But these\r\ndata respecting tint are fallacious, for, being founded solely on\r\nexternal appearance, they are liable to endless modifications. Stevenson\r\nfalls into the mistake of giving to the children of a negro father and\r\na white mother, the name of Zambos; whilst to the offspring of a white\r\nfather and a black mother, he gives the name of Mulattos. By a similar\r\nerror, he terms the children of a white man and a Cuarterona, Quinteros;\r\nand to those of a Cuarteron and a white woman, he gives the designation\r\nCuarterones. It is, however, an established rule, that the children bear\r\nthe designation, denoting the same degree of mixed blood, whatever may\r\nrespectively be the colors of the parents. Accordingly, the child of a\r\nnegro and a white woman is, properly speaking, a Mulatto; just the same\r\nas though the relations of race on the part of the parents were\r\ntransposed. When a man of mixed blood marries a woman darker than\r\nhimself, and his children thereby become further removed from the white\r\ntint, it is said to be _un paso atras_ (a step backwards).\r\n\r\nIn Europe it is very common to attach to the term _Creole_, the idea of\r\na particular complexion. This is a mistake. The designation Creole\r\nproperly belongs to all the natives of America born of parents who have\r\nemigrated from the Old World, be those parents Europeans or Africans.\r\nThere are, therefore, white as well as black Creoles.[26]\r\n\r\nThe subjoined list shows the parentage of the different varieties of\r\nhalf-casts, and also the proper designations of the latter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n           PARENTS.

The best criterion for determining\r\nthe varieties is the hair of the women: this is far less deceiving\r\nthan the complexion, for the color of the skin is sometimes\r\ndecidedly at variance with that characteristic of the race. Some of\r\nthe Mulatta females have complexions brilliantly fair, and features\r\nwhich, for regularity, may vie with those of the most beautiful\r\nwomen of Europe; but they bear the unmistakeable stamp of descent in\r\nthe short woolly hair.\r\n\r\nThe white Creole women of Lima have a peculiar quickness in detecting\r\na person of half-cast at the very first glance; and to the less\r\npractised observer they communicate their discoveries in this way,\r\nwith an air of triumph; for they have the very pardonable weakness of\r\npriding themselves in the purity of their European descent. Despite the\r\nrepublican constitution, there prevails throughout Peru a strong pride\r\nof cast, which shows itself at every opportunity. In quarrels, for\r\nexample, the fairer antagonist always taunts the darker one about his\r\ndescent. By all the varieties, the white skin is envied, and no one\r\nthinks of disputing its superiority of rank. The Indian looks with\r\nabhorrence on the Negro; the latter with scorn on the Indio. The\r\nMulatto fancies himself next to the European, and thinks that the\r\nlittle tinge of black in his skin does not justify his being ranked\r\nlower than the Mestizo, who after all is only an _Indio bruto_.[27]\r\nThe Zambo laughs at them all, and says \"if he himself is not worth\r\nmuch, yet he is better than his parents.\" In short, each race finds a\r\nreason for thinking itself better than another.\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of the present chapter I made the observation that\r\nthe people of mixed blood unite in themselves all the faults without\r\nany of the virtues of their progenitors. To this general remark,\r\nhowever, the Mestizos form an honorable exception. They inherit many\r\nof the good qualities both of the Whites and the Indians. They are\r\nmild and affectionate. Their feelings are very excitable, and they\r\nreadily perform an act of kindness or generosity on the impulse of\r\nthe moment--but they are irresolute and timid. They attach themselves\r\naffectionately to the Whites; but they are not partial to the\r\nIndians, whom they regard with some degree of contempt. In Lima their\r\nnumber is less considerable than in the interior of the country,\r\nwhere whole villages are inhabited solely by Mestizos. In those\r\nplaces they style themselves Whites, and hold themselves very much\r\naloof from the Indians. One cannot pay them a better compliment than\r\nto inquire whether they are Spaniards, a question which they always\r\nanswer in the affirmative, though their features are plainly\r\nimpressed with the Indian stamp. The complexion of the Mestizos is\r\nusually a clear brown; but in some individuals it has a very dark\r\ntinge. Their hair is sleek, long, and very strong. The women\r\nfrequently wear their hair in two long plaits descending nearly to\r\nthe knees. The men are strongly made, have marked features and but\r\nvery little beard. In Lima they are chiefly handicraftsmen and\r\ntraders. Most of the hawkers (Mercachifles) in Lima are Mestizos.\r\n\r\nThe Mulattos differ very widely from the Mestizos. In person they are\r\nless strongly made; but in intellect they are superior to any of the\r\nhalf-casts. They possess a very great aptitude for mechanical\r\nemployments, great dexterity and a remarkable degree of imitative\r\ntalent, which, if well directed, might be brilliantly developed. They\r\nare exceedingly impressionable, and all their feelings are readily\r\nexalted into passions. Indifferent to all out sensual enjoyments, they\r\nindulge in the fleeting pleasure of the present moment, and are\r\nregardless of the future. There is a certain class of Mulattos, who,\r\nin a psychological point of view, are very remarkable. They are\r\ndistinguished by the nick-name of _Palanganas_.[28] They are gifted\r\nwith wonderful memory, and after the lapse of years they will repeat,\r\nword for word, speeches or sermons which they have heard only once.\r\nWith this extraordinary power of memory, they combine a fertile fancy,\r\nand a boundless share of self-confidence. Wherever there is anything\r\nto be seen or heard, the Palanganas never fail to attend, and they\r\nrepeat with the most ludicrous attitudes and gestures all that they\r\nhear, be it a sermon in church, a speech in Congress, or an address\r\ndelivered at any public solemnity.\r\n\r\nThe Mulattos now study theology; for, since the establishment of\r\nindependence, the Indian law, which prohibited any person of mixed\r\nblood from entering the ecclesiastical state, is no longer observed.\r\nMany have devoted themselves to medicine; and most of the physicians\r\nin Lima are Mulattos; but they are remarkable only for their\r\nignorance, as they receive neither theoretical nor clinical\r\ninstruction. Nevertheless, they enjoy the full confidence of the\r\npublic, who rank the ignorant native far above the educated foreigner.\r\nThe business of a barber is one that is much followed by the Mulattos\r\nof Lima. In that occupation they are quite in their element, for they\r\npossess all the qualifications for which the members of that\r\nfraternity are distinguished in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nAmong the Mulatto females many are remarkably beautiful--though they\r\nare always wanting in that oval form of the face which is the first\r\ncondition of classic beauty. Their countenances are generally round\r\nand broad, their features strongly marked, and their expression\r\nimpassioned. Their beauty soon fades; and as they advance in life the\r\nnegro character of their features becomes distinctly defined. Their\r\nhair, which does not grow beyond a finger's length, is jet black and\r\nfrizzy. They plait it very ingeniously in small tresses, frequently\r\nmaking more than a hundred. Their complexions vary from white to\r\ndark-brown; but most of them are dark brunettes, with large black\r\neyes and pearl-white teeth.\r\n\r\nTheir vanity is quite equal to that of the Negresses, but it is\r\ncombined with a certain degree of taste, in which the latter are\r\nwanting. The Mulatto women are passionately fond of music, singing\r\nand dancing. They play the guitar and have pleasing voices, but\r\ntheir singing is quite uninstructed.\r\n\r\nThe Zambos are the most miserable class of half-casts. With them\r\nevery vice seems to have attained its utmost degree of development;\r\nand it may confidently be said that not one in a thousand is a useful\r\nmember of society, or a good subject of the state. Four-fifths of the\r\ncriminals in the city jail of Lima are Zambos. They commit the most\r\nhideous crimes with the utmost indifference, and their lawless\r\npropensities are continually bringing them into collision with the\r\nconstituted authorities. In moral nature they are below the Negroes;\r\nfor they are totally wanting in any good qualities possessed by the\r\nlatter. Their figures are athletic, and their color black, sometimes\r\nslightly tinged with olive-brown. Their noses are much less flat\r\nthan those of the Negroes, but their lips are quite as prominent.\r\nTheir eyes are sunk and penetrating, and their hair very little\r\nlonger than that of the Negroes, but curling in larger locks. The\r\nmen have very little beard.\r\n\r\nThe Chinos are but little superior to the Zambos. Indeed, in physical\r\nformation they are inferior to them, for they are small and\r\nattenuated. Their countenances are hideously ugly. They have the Negro\r\nnose and mouth, and the Indian forehead, cheeks and eyes. Their hair\r\nis black, rough, but less frizzy than that of the Mulattos. They are\r\ndeceitful, ill-tempered, and cruel. They never forget an offence, but\r\nbrood over it till an opportunity, however distant, presents itself\r\nfor wreaking their vengeance. They are very dangerous enemies.\r\n\r\nRespecting the half-casts of fairer complexion, especially the\r\nCuarterones and the Quinteros, there is but little to be said. Both\r\nphysically and morally they approximate closely to the whites, among\r\nwhom they almost rank themselves.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the foreigners in Lima, and indeed throughout the whole\r\nof Peru, are the families of the Spaniards from Europe, who emigrated to\r\nSouth America before the war of independence. Since the close of that\r\nstruggle there has been but little emigration, as the circumstances of\r\nthe country are not now very favorable to new settlers. The old Spanish\r\nfamilies are for the most part landed proprietors or merchants. They are\r\npeople of very temperate habits, but they are passionately fond of\r\ngaming, and in this respect they have bequeathed a dangerous inheritance\r\nto the Creoles. The pride and mercenary spirit which distinguished the\r\nSpaniards before the independence are now broken, if not entirely\r\nsubdued. The intercourse between them and the natives, though still\r\nsomewhat constrained, is every year becoming more and more friendly, as\r\nthe privileges enjoyed by the Spaniards, which were a continued cause of\r\nhostile feeling, are now removed.\r\n\r\nNext to the Spaniards, the most numerous class of foreigners are the\r\nItalians. These are chiefly Genoese, and the majority are run-away\r\nsailors and adventurers. They usually begin by setting up a Pulperia (a\r\nbrandy shop), or a spice shop, and gradually extend their traffic until,\r\nin the course of a few years, they amass money enough to return to their\r\nnative country. Some of them make good fortunes and possess extensive\r\nwarehouses.\r\n\r\nThe French in Lima occupy the same positions as their countrymen in\r\nValparaiso, viz., they are tailors and hair-dressers, dealers in\r\njewellery and millinery.\r\n\r\nThe English and North Americans, who are much better liked by the\r\nnatives than the French, are chiefly merchants. They are the heads of\r\nthe principal commercial houses, as Gibbs, Grawley & Co., Alsop & Co.,\r\nTempleman and Bergmann, Huth, Crüning & Co., &c. The enterprising\r\nspirit of the English and North Americans has led many of them into\r\nextensive mining speculations, which in some instances have proved\r\nvery unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe Germans in Lima are proportionally few. They are distinguished by\r\ntheir aptitude for business, and many of them fill high stations in the\r\ngreat English commercial houses. They are held in high esteem by the\r\nnatives. The general gravity of their manners has given rise, among the\r\nLimeños, to the saying, \"_Serio como un Aleman_\"--Serious as a German.\r\n\r\nSettlers from the other American republics have of late years\r\nconsiderably increased in Lima. After the Chilian expedition, many\r\nChilenos established themselves in Peru, and numbers of Argentinos,\r\nescaping from the terrorism of Rosas in Buenos Ayres, have taken refuge\r\nin Lima.\r\n\r\nForeigners being in general more industrious and more steady than the\r\nCreoles, the Limeños readily form connexions with them. The ladies\r\ngenerally prefer marrying a _Gringo_[29] to a _Paisanito_.[30]\r\n\r\nI may close this chapter on the inhabitants of Lima, with some remarks\r\non the Spanish language as spoken in the capital of Peru. The old\r\nSpaniards, who brought their various dialects into the New World, retain\r\nthem there unchanged. The Galician transposes the letters _g_ and _j_;\r\nthe Catalonian adds an _s_ to the final syllables of words, and gives a\r\npeculiarly harsh sound to the letter _j_; the Andalusian rolls the _r_\r\nover his tongue, and imparts a melodious expression even to\r\nharsh-sounding words; the Biscayan mingles a variety of provincialisms\r\nwith his own peculiar dialect. The Madrileño (native of Madrid) prides\r\nhimself here, as well as in Europe, in being far superior to the rest of\r\nhis countrymen in elegance of pronunciation. The Creoles, however, have\r\ngradually dropped the characteristic dialects of their progenitors, and\r\nhave adopted new ones, varying one from another in the different South\r\nAmerican provinces. The Spanish language, as spoken by the natives of\r\nPeru, differs widely from the correct and pure model of pronunciation.\r\nThe inhabitants of the coast have too soft an accent, and they\r\nfrequently confound, one with another, letters which have a mutual\r\nresemblance in sound. On the other hand, the people who dwell in the\r\nmountainous districts speak with a harsh accent, and very\r\nungrammatically. As the Swiss force out their guttural tones from the\r\nlowest depth of their throats, and with the strongest possible\r\naspiration, so do the Peruvians of the Cordillera. The inhabitants of\r\nthe sand flats of North Germany, on the contrary, impart a ludicrously\r\nsoft sound to the harsher consonants; and the same peculiarity is\r\nobservable in the people who inhabit the coast of Peru.\r\n\r\nOf all the inhabitants of Lima, the white Creoles speak the best\r\nSpanish; but still their language is far from pure. The ladies in\r\nparticular have the habit of substituting one letter for another in\r\ncertain words; for example, instead of _pulso_ (pulse) they say\r\n_purso_, and instead of _salsa_ (sauce) they say _sarsa_. In other\r\nwords they substitute _d_ for _r_, saying _amod_ for _amor_,\r\n_cavalledo_ for _cavallero_. The _ll_ is frequently sounded by the\r\nPeruvians like _y_, a blunder which foreigners are also very apt to\r\ncommit; for example, in the word _pollo_ (chicken), which they\r\npronounce as if it were spelled _poyo_, and _gallina_ (hen) they\r\npronounce as if spelled _gayina_. Not only do they confound single\r\nletters, but they frequently change whole syllables; as for instance,\r\nin the word _pared_ (wall), which they transform into _pader_. The\r\nname of the well-known ex-President Orbegoso was, by two-thirds of the\r\nnatives of Lima, pronounced as if written _Obregoso_. There is no word\r\nin the Spanish language beginning with an _s_ followed by a consonant,\r\nand the Limeños, when they attempt to pronounce foreign words or\r\nproper names commencing in the manner just described, never fail to\r\nprefix to them the letter _e_. I know not whether in the schools and\r\ncolleges of old Spain this method of prefixing the letter _e_ is\r\nadopted in teaching Latin; but the practice is universal among the\r\nstudents of all the colleges in Lima. For studium they say _estudium_;\r\nfor spurius, _espurius_; for sceleratus, _esceleratus_, &c.\r\n\r\nTo the Limeños the correct pronunciation of these words is extremely\r\ndifficult, and many have assured me that they find it impossible to\r\nomit the _e_ before the _s_. Still more arbitrary is their conversion\r\nof _h_ into _k_ in the words mihi, nihil, &c., which they pronounce\r\n_miki_, _nikil_.\r\n\r\nThe colored Creoles, who are generally uneducated, speak the Spanish\r\nlanguage much more corruptly than the whites. The Negroes have a very\r\nbad accent. Their tongues seem quite unfitted for the pronunciation of\r\nthe Spanish language, which many of them render unintelligible by\r\ntransposing letters and lopping off syllables.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Interpretations of the Indian Laws.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: His divine genius has produced eternal spring in\r\nArequipa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: \"Guia del Peru.\" \"Observaciones sobre el clima de Lima y\r\nsus influencias en los seres organizados en especial el hombre.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The women of Lima clean their teeth several times a day\r\nwith the root called _Raiz de dientes_ (literally _root for the teeth_),\r\nof which they keep a piece constantly in their pocket.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: It is related that, during the war of independence, when\r\nLima was alternately in possession of the Patriots and the Spaniards, a\r\nparty of the latter, in order to ascertain the spirit of the Limeños,\r\ndisguised themselves as Patriots and marched to the vicinity of the\r\ntown. On their approach becoming known, a great number of persons\r\nproceeded from Callao to the Alameda to meet them. Among those who went\r\nforth to welcome the supposed patriots were a number of women dressed in\r\nthe narrow _sayas_ above described.

There are thirty-six of these\r\nprimary schools, public and private; twenty for boys, and sixteen for\r\ngirls; and altogether about 2000 pupils[31] receive in these\r\nestablishments the first elements of juvenile instruction. The\r\nprincipal public institutions of this class are the Normal School of\r\nSanto Tomas (in which the Lancasterian system is adopted), and the\r\nCentral School of San Lazaro. Each contains from 320 to 350 pupils. Of\r\nthe private schools, some are very well conducted by Europeans. The\r\nCollege of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe was founded a few years ago by\r\ntwo Spanish merchants. In this establishment the sons of the wealthier\r\nclass of people may receive a better education than they can obtain in\r\nthe public schools. There are three Latin schools, and the number of\r\npupils attending them amounts to about two hundred.\r\n\r\nThe College of Santo Toribio is exclusively appropriated to students of\r\ntheology, who are likewise received into the College of San Carlos,\r\nthough the latter is chiefly destined for the study of jurisprudence.\r\nSan Carlos was founded in the year 1770 by the Viceroy Amat, who\r\nincorporated with it the previously existing Colleges of San Martin and\r\nSan Felipe. In the year 1822 the Colegio de Esquilache was likewise\r\nunited to San Carlos, which now contains about a hundred students. The\r\nbuilding is large and commodious, containing spacious halls, a fine\r\nrefectory, and a well-stored library. There are five professors of law\r\nand two of theology. French, English, geography, natural philosophy,\r\nmathematics, drawing, and music are likewise taught in this college. The\r\nannual revenue of the establishment, exclusively of the fees paid by the\r\nstudents, amounts to 19,000 dollars. During the war of emancipation,\r\nthis establishment for a time bore the name of Colegio de San Martin, in\r\nhonor of General San Martin, the liberator of Chile; but its original\r\ntitle was soon restored.\r\n\r\nThe Colegio de San Fernando was founded in 1810 by the Marques de la\r\nConcordia, for students of medicine. In the year 1826 this Institution\r\nreceived the name of _Colegio de la Medecina de la Independencia_, a\r\ntitle which it justly merits, for certainly medicine is taught there\r\nwith a singular independence of all rules and systems. The Professors,\r\nwho themselves have never received any regular instruction, communicate\r\ntheir scanty share of knowledge in a very imperfect manner to the\r\nstudents. The number of the students is between twelve and fifteen, and\r\nthere are two Professors. The clinical lectures are delivered in the\r\nHospital of San Andres, to which an anatomical amphitheatre was\r\nattached in 1792. The heat of the climate renders it necessary that\r\nburials should take place within twenty-four hours after death, a\r\ncircumstance which naturally operates as an impediment to the\r\nfundamental study of anatomy. It cannot therefore be matter of surprise\r\nthat the native surgeons should have but a superficial knowledge of\r\nthat important branch of science.\r\n\r\nIn the University of San Marcos no lectures are delivered, and the\r\ntwenty-five Professors' chairs are merely nominal. Honors and degrees\r\nare however conferred in San Marcos, and the same rules and ceremonies\r\nare observed as in the Spanish Universities. In the departments of\r\nmedicine and jurisprudence there are three degrees; those of Bachelor,\r\nLicentiate, and Doctor. In former times the dignity of Doctor was\r\nconferred with great pomp and solemnity, and the public were admitted in\r\nlarge numbers to witness the ceremony. The acquisition of the degree of\r\nDoctor was then attended by an expense of about two thousand dollars,\r\nchiefly expended in presents. The new Doctor was required to send to\r\nevery member of the University, from the Bachelors to the Rector, a new\r\ndollar, a goblet full of ice, and a dish of pastry.\r\n\r\nLima is overrun with monks, lay and conventual. The monastic regulations\r\nare not very strict, for the monks are permitted to leave the convents\r\nat all hours, according to their own pleasure. They avail themselves of\r\nthis liberty to the utmost extent. Friars of various orders are seen in\r\nthe streets in numbers. Most of them are fat Dominicans, who sit in the\r\nPortales playing at draughts, or lounge in shops staring at the\r\n_Tapadas_ as they pass by. Many of these ecclesiastics are remarkable\r\nfor their disregard of personal cleanliness; indeed it would be\r\ndifficult to meet with a more slovenly, ignorant, and common-place class\r\nof men. They frequent all places of public entertainment, the\r\ncoffee-houses, the chichereas, the bull-fights, and the theatres: these\r\ntwo last-mentioned places of amusement they visit in disguise. The\r\nFranciscans and the Mercenarias are little better than the Dominicans;\r\nbut the Descalzados (barefooted friars) lead a somewhat more strict and\r\nregular life. To the monks of the _Buena Muerte_ belongs the duty of\r\nadministering the last consolation to the dying. Whenever they hear of\r\nany person who is dangerously ill, they hasten to the house without\r\nwaiting till they are sent for, and they never leave the invalid until\r\nhe either recovers or dies. Day and night they sit by the sick-bed, and\r\nscarcely allow themselves time for necessary rest and refreshment. I\r\nhave known many of these monks who, from long experience and\r\nobservation, but without any medical knowledge, had acquired wonderful\r\nshrewdness in determining the degree of danger in cases of illness, and\r\nwho could foretel with almost unfailing certainty the moment of\r\ndissolution. As soon as the patient has breathed his last, the monk\r\nutters a short prayer, then giving the corpse a knock on the nose, he\r\nsilently takes his departure. I have frequently witnessed this singular\r\ncustom, but I never could discover its origin or motive. The habit worn\r\nby the monks of _Buena Muerte_ is black, with a large red cross on the\r\nbreast, and hats with high conical crowns.\r\n\r\nMany pious natives, or inhabitants of Lima, have been admitted among the\r\nnumber of the saints. Of these the most distinguished was the Spaniard\r\nToribio, who, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, filled the\r\narchiepiscopal chair in Lima. His kindness and charity have become\r\nproverbial, and his many acts of benevolence are still alive in the\r\nrecollection of the people. Of many anecdotes that are related of him, I\r\nmay here quote one. Late one night, the patrol who was on duty in the\r\nvicinity of the archbishop's palace, met a man in the street carrying a\r\nheavy load on his back. The challenge, \"Who goes there?\" was answered by\r\nthe name \"Toribio.\" The watch, uttering an oath, impatiently called out\r\n\"Que Toribio?\" (What Toribio?) \"El de la esquina!\" (He who dwells at the\r\ncorner!) was the simple reply. The soldier angrily stepped up to his\r\ninterlocutor, and, to his astonishment, recognized the archbishop, who\r\nwas carrying a sick person to the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe saint to whom the Limeños render the highest honor, is Santa Rosa,\r\nthe saint of the city. She was a native of Lima, and is the only\r\nPeruvian female who has attained the honor of being ranked among the\r\nsaints. On the 30th of August, the festival of Santa Rosa is\r\ncelebrated with great pomp in the cathedral, and her image, richly\r\nbedecked with gold and jewels, is carried in solemn procession from\r\nSanto Domingo to the Sagrario.\r\n\r\nReligious processions are among the most favorite amusements of the\r\ninhabitants of Lima. They are always very numerously attended; and it\r\nmay fairly be said that no merry-making would afford the Limeños so much\r\ndiversion as they derive from these pious solemnities. Vast numbers of\r\nladies join the processions as Tapadas, indulging in all sorts of\r\ncoquettish airs, and with thoughts evidently bent on any subject but\r\nreligion. The gentlemen station themselves in groups at the corners of\r\nthe streets, to admire the graceful figures of the Tapadas, whose faces\r\nare concealed; and when the procession has passed one corner they rush\r\nto another, to see it defile a second time; and in this manner continue\r\nmoving from place to place, as if they could never see enough of the\r\ninteresting spectacle. The most brilliant processions are those which\r\ntake place on the festivals of Corpus Christi, San Francisco, and Santo\r\nDomingo. A very solemn procession takes place on the 28th of October,\r\nthe anniversary of the great earthquake of 1746.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, at a quarter to nine, the great bell of the cathedral\r\nannounces the raising of the host, during the performance of high mass.\r\nImmediately every sound is hushed in the streets and squares. Coachmen\r\nstop the carriages, riders check their horses, and foot-passengers stand\r\nmotionless. Every one suspends his occupation or his conversation, and\r\nkneeling down, with head uncovered, mutters a prayer. But scarcely has\r\nthe third solemn stroke of the bell ceased to vibrate, when the noise\r\nand movement are resumed; the brief but solemn stillness of the few\r\npreceding moments being thus rendered the more impressive by contrast.\r\nThe same incident is renewed in the evening, between six and seven\r\no'clock, when the bell sounds for the Angelus (Oraciones). The cathedral\r\nbell gives the signal, by three slow, measured sounds, which are\r\nimmediately repeated from the belfries of all the churches in Lima. Life\r\nand action are then, as if by an invisible hand, suddenly suspended;\r\nnothing moves but the lips of the pious, whispering their prayers. The\r\n_Oracion_ being ended, every one makes the sign of the cross, and says\r\nto the person nearest him, _Bueñas noches_ (Good night). It is regarded\r\nas an act of courtesy to allow another to take precedence in saying\r\n\"Good night,\" and if several persons are together, it is expected that\r\nthe eldest or the most distinguished of the group should be the first to\r\nutter the greeting. It is considered polite to request the person next\r\none to say _Bueñas noches_; he with equal civility declines; and the\r\nalternate repetition of \"_diga Vm._\" (you say it), \"_No, Señor, diga\r\nVm._\" (No, Sir, you say it), threatens sometimes to be endless.\r\n\r\nThe effect produced by the three strokes of the cathedral bell is truly\r\nastonishing. The half-uttered oath dies on the lips of the uncouth\r\nnegro; the arm of the cruel Zambo, unmercifully beating his ass, drops\r\nas if paralyzed; the chattering mulatto seems as if suddenly struck\r\ndumb; the smart repartee of the lively Tapada is cut short in its\r\ndelivery; the shopkeeper lays down his measure; the artizan drops his\r\ntool; and the monk suspends his move on the draught-board: all, with one\r\naccord, join in the inaudible prayer. Here and there the sight of a\r\nforeigner walking along indifferently, and without raising his hat,\r\nmakes a painful impression on the minds of the people.\r\n\r\nChristmas-night (_Noche buena_) is a great festival in Lima. The streets\r\nand squares, especially the _Plaza Mayor_, are crowded with people,\r\namusing themselves in all sorts of ways. Hundreds of persons take their\r\nseats on the benches of the Plaza; there they regale themselves with\r\nsherbet, ices, and pastry, and look at the dancing of the negroes, &c.\r\nOn this occasion the midnight mass is performed with extraordinary\r\nsolemnity. On Christmas-day some of the families of Lima get up what are\r\ncalled _Nacimientos_, consisting of symbolical representations of the\r\nbirth of the Saviour. On some of these shows considerable expense and\r\ningenuity are bestowed.\r\n\r\nIn Carnival time Lima is so unpleasant a place of residence that many\r\nfamilies retire to the country during that season of misrule. One of the\r\nfavorite sports consists in sprinkling people with water; and from all\r\nthe balconies various kinds of liquids are thrown on the passers-by.\r\nGroups of Negroes post themselves at the corners of the streets, where\r\nthey seize people, and detain them prisoners, until they ransom\r\nthemselves by the payment of a certain sum of money. Those who do not\r\npay the money are rolled in the street gutters, and treated in the most\r\nmerciless way; whilst those who purchase grace escape with having a few\r\nhandfulls of dirty water thrown in their faces. Even in private houses,\r\nrelations and intimate acquaintances are guilty of the most\r\nunwarrantable annoyances. Parties of young men enter the houses of\r\nfamilies with whom they are acquainted, and begin sprinkling the ladies\r\nwith scented water. That being exhausted, spring water, or even dirty\r\nwater, is resorted to, so that what began in sport ends in reckless\r\nrudeness. The ladies, with their clothes dripping wet, are chased from\r\nroom to room, and thereby become heated. The consequence is, in many\r\ninstances, severe and dangerous illness. Inflammation of the lungs,\r\nague, rheumatism, &c., are the usual results of these carnival sports,\r\nto which many fall victims. A year never passes in which several murders\r\nare not committed, in revenge for offences perpetrated during the\r\nsaturnalia of the carnival.\r\n\r\nA very favorite trick adopted in carnival time, for frightening people\r\nas they pass along the streets, is the following:--a sack, filled with\r\nfragments of broken glass and porcelain, is fastened to the balcony by a\r\nstrong rope, of such a length that, when suspended from the window, the\r\nsack is about seven feet above the street. The apparatus being all\r\nready, a mischievous negress and her _amita_ (young mistress) watch the\r\npassers-by until they select one for their victim. The sack is then\r\nthrown over the front of the balcony, and a deafening crash ensues,\r\nthough the rope prevents its contents from hurting any one. It is well\r\nknown that in almost every street in Lima there is at least one balcony\r\nready prepared for the performance of this trick; yet the suddenness of\r\nthe crash always proves a shock, even to the strongest nerves. People\r\nstart and run to one side of the street, and are sometimes so terrified\r\nthat they drop down; then loud laughter and jeering remarks are heard in\r\nthe balcony. Every year this trick is prohibited by the police, but the\r\nprohibition is treated with contempt.\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular recreations of the Limeños, especially of the\r\npeople of color, is the _Paseo de Amancaes_, which takes place on St.\r\nJohn's Day. The Amancaes is a gently sloping plain, about half a mile\r\nnorth-west of Lima, and it is bounded by a semicircular range of hills,\r\nwhich rise from twelve to fifteen thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea. During the hot months of the year this plain is a parched and\r\nbarren waste; but when the misty and rainy season sets in, the Amancaes\r\nis covered with numerous flowers, among which a beautiful yellow lily is\r\nconspicuous. About the end of June this lily is in full bloom. On St.\r\nJohn's Day booths and stalls are fitted up for the sale of various kinds\r\nof refreshments, and throngs of people of all classes and colors are\r\nseen riding or walking in the direction of the Amancaes. There they\r\namuse themselves with dancing, playing, eating, drinking, and gathering\r\nflowers; and in the evening they return to Lima. It is amusing to see\r\nthe Mulattas and Zambas with bouquets of yellow lilies stuck in their\r\nheads and bosoms. These women crowd into heavily-laden vehicles, beside\r\nwhich their black cavaliers ride on horseback--all laughing, jesting,\r\nand giving vent to unrestrained mirth. From the 24th of June to the end\r\nof October, pleasure parties repair on Sundays and festival days, either\r\nto the Amancaes or to the Lomas. The latter is a range of hills a little\r\nfurther from Lima.\r\n\r\nThere is no want of promenades in the vicinity of the city. Leading from\r\nthe Callao gate is the fine long avenue of trees I have already\r\nmentioned. In the suburb of San Lazaro there is a fine broad promenade\r\nplanted with trees, called the _alameda vieja_, at the end of which is\r\nsituated the Convent of the Descalzos. Along the bank of the Rimac there\r\nis a new promenade planted with four rows of trees, called the _alameda\r\nnueva_. Behind it the _Paseo militar_, with two rows of trees, extending\r\nas far as _Piedra lisa_, on the road to the pleasant village of\r\nLurigancho. On the right of these promenades is the river, on the left\r\nthe pyramidal hill, of the Cerro de San Cristoval. At the extremity of\r\nthe Alameda nueva are the Puquio.[32] These baths are within a long\r\nlow-roofed building, covered on the top with straw mats.\r\n\r\nOn summer evenings the bridge and the Plaza Mayor are visited by\r\nthrongs of promenaders who there enjoy the refreshing breeze, which,\r\nafter sunset, is wafted from the Cordilleras, along the surface of the\r\nRimac. After the hour of the _Oraciones_ (evening prayers), the bridge\r\nis crowded with gentlemen, who walk up and down whilst the ladies sit\r\nin the rotundas built above each of the piers. Long rows of\r\npromenaders are seen moving to and fro, either going to the Alamedas,\r\nor returning from thence to the Plaza, to obtain refreshments. Before\r\nthe Portal de los Escribanos, on the Plaza Mayor, tables are laid out\r\nwith lemonade, almond milk and ices. The promenaders sit down on\r\nbenches, which are placed round these tables, and partake of\r\nrefreshments, none of which, however, are so delicious as the cool\r\nbreeze after the sultry heat of the day.\r\n\r\nTo the inhabitants of Lima, ice is one of the necessaries of life: it is\r\nconsidered so indispensable, that a scarcity of it, during several days,\r\nwould be sufficient to excite popular ferment. In all revolutions,\r\ntherefore, the leaders carefully avoid calling into requisition the\r\nservice of the mules employed in the transport of ice. It is obtained in\r\nthe Cordilleras, at the distance of about twenty-eight leagues from\r\nLima. The Indians who ascend the glaciers break the ice into blocks of\r\nabout six arobas in weight, which are lowered by ropes down the\r\ndeclivity of the mountain. The women and children then cover the blocks\r\nof ice with Ichu grass (_Joara ichu_, R. P.), after which they are drawn\r\nby another party of Indians to a depôt, about two leagues distant, where\r\nthey are packed on the backs of mules. Each mule carries two blocks.\r\nThirty mules form what is called a _Recua_, which daily proceeds from\r\nthe ice depôt to Lima. At intervals of two or three miles there are\r\nstations where relays of mules are in readiness. The operations of\r\nunloading and reloading are performed with the utmost possible speed,\r\nand the mules are driven at a brisk trot, wherever the roads will admit\r\nof it. In the space of eighteen or twenty hours, the ice reaches Lima,\r\nand as may be expected, considerably reduced in weight by melting. The\r\naverage loss on two blocks of ice is about one hundred pounds.[33] The\r\ndaily consumption of ice in Lima is between fifty and fifty-five cwt.\r\nAbout two-thirds of that quantity is used for preparing ices, most of\r\nwhich are made of milk or pine-apple juice. Ice is hawked about the\r\nstreets of Lima for sale, and all day long Indians, carrying pails on\r\ntheir heads, perambulate the streets, crying _helado_.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Lima, when they make visits, seldom go on foot. They\r\ngenerally ride in the _caleza_, a very ugly kind of vehicle, being\r\nnothing more than a square box raised on two high wheels, and drawn\r\nby a mule, on whose back a negro in livery is mounted. Many of the\r\nolder calezas, instead of being painted on the outside, are covered\r\nwith variegated paper. The calezin is a prettier kind of carriage,\r\nand is drawn by two horses or mules. Taste in the article of carriages\r\nis, however, improving in Lima, and several very elegant ones have\r\nbeen recently introduced.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years a regular line of omnibuses has been\r\nestablished between Callao and Lima. From each of those cities an\r\nomnibus starts daily, at eight in the morning and at four in the\r\nafternoon, and the journey occupies an hour and a half. To Miraflores,\r\nChorillos, Lurin, and other places on the coast, the conveyance is by\r\na _balanzin_, a sort of caleza, drawn by three horses harnessed\r\nabreast. This balanzin is one of the most awkward vehicles ever\r\ninvented, and the slightest shock it sustains is felt with double\r\nforce by the persons riding in it. At greater distances from the\r\ncapital, the want of proper roads renders the employment of vehicles a\r\nmatter of difficulty. Even along the coast to the south of Lima, a\r\njourney of about forty leagues cannot be accomplished without vast\r\ndifficulty and expense. On such a journey it is usual for a train of\r\nsixty or eighty horses to accompany the carriage; and it is found\r\nnecessary to change the horses every half-hour, owing to the\r\ndifficulty of drawing the carriage through the fine quicksand, which\r\nis often more than a foot deep. A Peruvian planter, who was accustomed\r\nto take his wife every year on a visit to his plantation, situated\r\nabout thirty-two leagues from Lima, assured me that the journey to and\r\nfro always cost him 1400 dollars.\r\n\r\nDuring the brilliant period of the Spanish domination, incredible sums\r\nwere frequently expended on carriages and mules. Not unfrequently the\r\ntires of the caleza wheels and the shoes of the mules were of silver\r\ninstead of iron.\r\n\r\nIn Peru, riding is a universal custom, and almost every person keeps\r\none or more horses. The ladies of Lima are distinguished as graceful\r\nhorsewomen. Their equestrian costume consists of a white riding-habit,\r\ntrowsers richly trimmed with lace, a fine white poncho, and a\r\nbroad-brimmed straw hat. Some of the females of the colored races make\r\nuse of men's saddles, and display great skill in the management of the\r\nmost unruly horses.\r\n\r\nThe horse-trappings used in Peru are often very costly. On the coast and\r\nin the interior, I have sometimes seen head-gear, bridle, and crupper,\r\ncomposed of finely-wrought silver rings, linked one into another. The\r\nsaddle is frequently ornamented with rich gold embroidery, and the\r\nholster inlaid with gold. The stirrups are usually the richest portion\r\nof the trappings. They are made of carved wood, and are of pyramidal\r\nshape; about a foot high and a foot broad at the base. In front and at\r\nthe sides they are close, and are open only at the back in the part\r\nwhere the foot rests. The edges are rimmed with silver, and the top of\r\nthe stirrup is surmounted by a bell of the same metal, with a ring\r\nthrough which the straps are passed. A priest with whom I was acquainted\r\nin the Sierra, got a saddle and a pair of stirrups made for me. The\r\nsilver ornaments on the stirrups alone weighed forty pounds. The\r\ndecorations of the saddle were of corresponding richness. The value of\r\nthe silver on both saddle and stirrups was about 1500 dollars. The spurs\r\nused in Peru are of colossal magnitude. Old custom ordains that they\r\nmust contain three marks (a pound and a half) of silver. The stirrup-bow\r\nis broad and richly wrought; the ornaments being either of the pattern\r\ncalled _hueso de tollo_,[34] or of that styled _hoja de laurel con\r\nsemilla_.[35] The rowel is one and a half or two inches in diameter, and\r\nthe points are about twenty-five or thirty inches long.\r\n\r\nIn the bridle, the bit and the snaffle are in one piece, and the reins\r\nare brought together by being passed through a ring, to which the long\r\nriding-whip is also fastened. The head-band and reins are commonly\r\ncomposed of narrow slips of untanned calf or sheep-skin, plaited\r\ntogether, and ornamented with silver buckles. The saddle is short and\r\nnarrow, and exceedingly awkward to riders unaccustomed to it. The front\r\nbolster is four or five inches high, and inclines backward; the hind one\r\nis lower, and is curved forward in the form of a half-moon; the\r\nintervening space just affording sufficient room for the thighs of the\r\nrider, who, in a saddle of this construction, is so firmly fixed that he\r\ncannot possibly fall. These saddles have, however, one great\r\ndisadvantage, viz., that if the horse starts off at a gallop, and the\r\nrider has not time to throw himself back in his seat, he is forced\r\nagainst the front saddle-bolster with such violence that some fatal\r\ninjury is usually the consequence. Under the saddle is laid a\r\nhorse-cloth, called the _pellon_, about a yard long, and a yard and a\r\nhalf wide. The common sort of pellones are composed of two rough\r\nsheep-skins, sewed together. In the finer kind, the raw wool is combed\r\nout, and divided into numberless little twists, of about the length of\r\none's finger; so that the pellon resembles the skin of some\r\nlong-haired animal. The finest Peruvian pellones are made of a mixture\r\nof sheep's wool and goat's hair. Between the saddle and the pellon are\r\nfastened the saddle-bags (_alforjas_), which, on long journeys, are\r\nfilled with provisions and other necessaries. These bags are made\r\neither of leather or strong woollen cloth; finally, the trappings of a\r\nPeruvian horse are not complete without the halter (_haquima_), which\r\nis ornamented in the same manner as the bridle. The halter-strap\r\n(_cabresto_) is wound round the front bolster of the saddle, and by it\r\nthe horse may be fastened whenever the rider alights, without the use\r\nof the reins for that purpose. At first a foreigner is apt to regard\r\nthe equipments of a Peruvian horse as superfluous and burthensome; but\r\nhe is soon convinced of their utility, and, when the eye becomes\r\nfamiliar to them, they have a pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nThe pure-bred Peruvian horse is more elegantly formed than his\r\nAndalusian progenitor. He is of middling size, seldom exceeding\r\nfourteen hands high. He has a strong expanded chest, slender legs,\r\nthin pasterns, a short muscular neck, a rather large head, small\r\npointed ears, and a fiery eye. He is spirited, docile, and enduring.\r\nIt is only in a few plantations that the purity of the race is\r\npreserved, and the animals fostered with due care. The common horse is\r\nhigher, leaner, less broad on the chest, and with the crupper thinner\r\nand more depressed. He is, however, not less fiery and capable of\r\nendurance than the horse of pure breed. The most inferior horses are\r\nill-looking, small, and rough-skinned.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Peru the horses are for the most part natural amblers,\r\nand, if they do not amble naturally, they are taught to do so. There are\r\nseveral varieties of amble peculiar to the Peruvian horse; the most\r\napproved is that called the _paso llano_. It is very rapid, but not\r\nattended by any jolting motion to the rider. A well-trained horse may\r\nsafely be ridden by a young child at the _paso llano_; the motion being\r\nso gentle and regular, that the rider may carry a cup of water in his\r\nhand without spilling a drop, at the same time going at the rate of two\r\nleagues an hour. Another variety of ambling is called the _paso\r\nportante_. It consists in the fore and hind foot of one side being\r\nraised simultaneously, and thrust forward. In this movement, the greater\r\nor less speed depends on the degree in which the hind foot is advanced\r\nin comparison with the fore one. It is a rapid, rocking sort of motion,\r\nand for long continuance is much more wearying to the rider than the\r\ncommon trot, as the body cannot be held upright, but must be kept in a\r\nconstant stooping position. The speed of a good ambler in the _paso\r\nportante_ is so great, that he will outstrip another horse at full\r\ngallop. The giraffe, as well as the Peruvian horse, has this peculiar\r\nmovement naturally. The _paso compañero_ is merely a nominal\r\nmodification of the _paso portante_. Many horses have no _paso llano_,\r\nbut in its stead a short trot. These have naturally the _paso portante_,\r\nbut they are little esteemed for travelling, though they are good\r\nworking animals. They are called _cavallos aguelillos_. Trotting horses\r\ncannot be taught the _paso llano_, though they easily acquire the _paso\r\nportante_. These are called _cavallos trabados_.\r\n\r\nIn Peru a horse is valued less for beauty of form than for the\r\nperfection of his amble. The finest trotters are sold at very low\r\nprices, and are used exclusively as carriage horses. If a horse when\r\nspurred has the habit of flapping his tail, it is considered a serious\r\nfault, and greatly depreciates the value of the animal. This vice is\r\ncalled _mosquear_ (literally brushing off the mosquitoes), and the\r\nPeruvians cure it by an incision in the muscle of the tail, by which\r\nmeans the horse is disabled from making the movement.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvians take very little care of their horses. The remark, that\r\nthe more the horse is tended, the worse he is, would seem to be a\r\ngenerally admitted truth in Peru. The stable (_coral_) is either totally\r\nroofless, or very indifferently sheltered. In the mountainous parts of\r\nthe country, and during the rainy season, horses are frequently, for the\r\nspace of six months, up to their knees in mud, and yet they never seem\r\nto be the worse for it. The fodder consists of lucern (_alfalfa_), or\r\nmaisillo, which is usually thrown down on the ground, though sometimes\r\nplaced in a stone trough, and the drink of the animals consists of\r\nimpure water collected from the ditches at the road sides. Occasionally\r\nthe horses are fed with maize, which they are very fond of. As no oats\r\nare grown in Peru, barley is given together with maize, especially in\r\nthe interior of the country. Mares and geldings have sometimes the hair\r\nbetween the ears cut off quite closely, and the mane arranged in short\r\ncurls, which gives them a resemblance to the horses in ancient\r\nsculpture. Mares are but little valued, so little indeed, that no\r\nrespectable person will ride one.\r\n\r\nThe horse-breakers (_chalanes_) are generally free men of color. They\r\npossess great bodily vigor, and understand their business thoroughly;\r\nbut they use the horses very cruelly, and thereby render them shy. For\r\nthe first three years foals are suffered to roam about with perfect\r\nfreedom; after that time they are saddled, an operation not performed\r\nwithout great difficulty, and sometimes found to be impracticable,\r\nuntil the animal is thrown on the ground and his limbs tied. The young\r\nhorse under the management of the _chalan_ is trained in all sorts of\r\nequestrian feats, especially the art of pirouetting (_voltear_). This\r\nconsists in turning either wholly or half round on the hind legs with\r\ngreat rapidity and when at full gallop. Another important object of\r\nthe _chalan_ is to teach the horse to stop short suddenly, and to\r\nstand perfectly motionless (_sentarse_) at the signal of his rider;\r\nand to go backward (_cejar_) for a considerable space in a straight\r\nline. When all this is accomplished, the horse is regarded as\r\ncompletely broken (_quebrantado_).\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the certainty with which a Peruvian horse will make a\r\npirouette (_voltata_) at the signal of his rider, I may mention the\r\nfollowing fact, which occurred under my own observation. A friend of\r\nmine, in Lima, rode at full gallop up to the city wall (which is\r\nscarcely nine feet broad), leaped upon it, and then made his horse\r\nperform a complete _voltata_, so that the fore-feet of the animal\r\ndescribed the segment of a circle beyond the edge of the wall. The feat\r\nhe performed several times in succession, and he assured me he could do\r\nthe same with all his horses.\r\n\r\nPeruvian taste requires that the neck of the horse should present a\r\nfinely-curved outline, and that the mouth should be drawn inward, so as\r\nto approach the breast. The horses called _Cavallos_ de Brazo are much\r\nesteemed. At every step they describe a large circle with their\r\nfore-feet, in such a manner that the horse-shoe strikes the lower part\r\nof the stirrup. This motion is exceedingly beautiful when combined with\r\nwhat is termed the \"Spanish pace,\" in which the noble form of the animal\r\nand his proud bearing are advantageously displayed.\r\n\r\nThe mule is a very important animal in Peru. The badness of the roads\r\nwould render commercial communication impracticable, were it not for\r\nmules. The Peruvian mules are fine, strong animals. The best are reared\r\nin Piura, and sent to Lima for sale. The amblers are selected for the\r\nsaddle, the trotters for harness, and the rest are used as beasts of\r\nburthen. The price of a mule of middling quality is one hundred dollars;\r\na better one double or treble that price; and the very best may even\r\ncost ten times as much. The endurance of these animals under fatigue and\r\nindifferent nurture is extraordinary, and without them the vast sand\r\nplains of Peru would present insuperable obstacles to intercourse\r\nbetween one place and another. In the power of continuous ambling they\r\nexceed the horses, and are often equal to them in speed.\r\n\r\nIn Lima there is a public lottery, which the Government farms to a\r\nprivate individual, for a considerable sum. The tickets are drawn\r\nweekly. The price of a ticket is one real. The largest prize is 1000\r\ndollars; the smaller prizes 500, 250, or 100 dollars. A lottery on a\r\nlarger scale is drawn every three months. The highest prize in this\r\nlottery is 4000 dollars, and the price of the ticket is four reals. To\r\nevery ticket is affixed a motto, usually consisting of an invocation to\r\na saint, and a prayer for good luck, and at the drawing of the lottery\r\nthis motto is read aloud when the number of the ticket is announced. Few\r\nof the inhabitants of Lima fail to buy at least one ticket in the weekly\r\nlottery. The negroes are particularly fond of trying their luck in this\r\nway, and in many instances fortune has been singularly kind to them.\r\n\r\n\"Eating and drinking keep soul and body together.\" So says the German\r\nproverb; and it may not be uninteresting to take a glance at the Limeños\r\nduring their performance of these two important operations. The hour of\r\nbreakfast is generally nine in the morning. The meal consists of boiled\r\nmutton (_Sancochado_), soup (_Caldo_), with yuccas, a very\r\npleasant-tasted root, and _Chupe_. This last-mentioned dish consists, in\r\nits simplest form, merely of potatoes boiled in very salt water, with\r\ncheese and Spanish pepper. When the chupe is made in better style, eggs,\r\ncrabs, and fried fish are added to the ingredients already named; and it\r\nis then a very savory dish. Chocolate and milk are afterwards served. A\r\nnegress brings the _Chocolatera_ into the breakfast-room, and pours out\r\na cup full for each person. The natives prefer the froth to the actual\r\nbeverage; and many of the negresses are such adepts in the art of\r\npouring out, that they will make the cup so overflow with foam, that it\r\ncontains scarcely a spoonful of liquid. Chocolate is the favorite\r\nbeverage of the Peruvians. In the southern parts of the country it is\r\ncustomary to offer it to visitors at all hours of the day. The visitor\r\nis no sooner seated than he is presented with a cup of coffee, which is\r\noften so thick that the spoon will stand upright in it. It would be a\r\nbreach of politeness to decline this refreshment, and whether agreeable\r\nor not it must be swallowed!\r\n\r\nThe best cocoa is obtained from the Montañas of Urubamba, and from the\r\nBolivian Yungas. The long land transport, however, renders it very\r\ndear, and therefore the nuts brought from Guayaquil are those commonly\r\nused in Lima.\r\n\r\nDinner, which takes place about two or three in the afternoon, commences\r\nwith a very insipid kind of soup. This is followed by the _Puchero_,\r\nwhich is the principal dish. Puchero, made in its best style, contains\r\nbeef, pork, bacon, ham, sausage, poultry, cabbage, yuccas, camotes (a\r\nsort of sweet potato), potatoes, rice, peas, _choclitas_ (grains of\r\nmaize), quince and banana. When served up, the different kinds of meat\r\nare placed in one dish, and the vegetable ingredients in another. I was\r\nat first astonished at the poorness of the soups in Lima, considering\r\nthe quantity of meat used in preparing them; but I soon discovered that\r\nthe soup served up to table was little more than water, and that the\r\nstrong gravy of the meat was either thrown away or given to the negroes.\r\nThere prevails an almost universal belief that the liquor in which the\r\nmeat is first stewed is injurious to health. Only a very few families\r\nare sufficiently free from this prejudice to allow the strong gravy to\r\nbe used in the preparation of _caldo_, &c. The Puchero is an excellent\r\nand nutritious dish, and would in itself suffice for a dinner, to which,\r\nhowever, in Lima, it is merely the introduction. Roast meat, fish,\r\nvegetables, preserves and salad are afterwards served. Another dish not\r\nless indispensable to a Lima dinner than _puchero_, is _picante_. Under\r\nthis denomination are included a variety of preparations, in which a\r\nvast quantity of cayenne pepper is introduced. The most favorite\r\n_picantes_ are the _calapulcra_, the _lagua_, the _zango_, the\r\n_charquican_, the _adobas_, the _picante de ullucos_, &c. The\r\n_calapulcra_ is composed of meat and potatoes dried and finely pounded;\r\nthe _lagua_ is made of maize flour and pork; the _zango_, of the same\r\ningredients, but differently prepared; the _adobas_ consists of pork\r\nalone; and the _picante de ullucos_ is made of a root resembling the\r\npotato, cut into small square bits. These dishes, though much too highly\r\nseasoned for European palates, are considered great dainties by the\r\nLimeños. All the _picantes_ have a very red color, owing to the quantity\r\nof cayenne used in preparing them; the _achote_ grains, which are also\r\nused, produce a beautiful vermilion tint. Another dish, common on the\r\ndinner-table in Lima, is called _ensalada de frutas_. It is a most\r\nheterogeneous compound, consisting of all sorts of fruits stewed in\r\nwater. To none but a Limanian stomach could such a mixture be agreeable.\r\nThe dessert consists of fruits and sweets (_dulces_). The Limeño must\r\nalways drink a glass of water after dinner, otherwise he imagines the\r\nrepast can do him no good; but to warrant the drinking of the water, or,\r\nas the phrase is, _para tomar agua_, it is necessary first to partake of\r\n_dulces_. The one without the other would be quite contrary to rule. The\r\ndulces consist of little cakes made of honey or of the pulp of the\r\nsugar-cane; or they are preserved fruits, viz., pine-apple, quince,\r\ncitron, and sometimes preserved beans or cocoa-nut. There is also a\r\nfavorite kind of dulce made from maize, called _masamora_.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvians have some very singular prejudices on the subject of\r\neating and drinking. Every article of food is, according to their\r\nnotions, either heating (_caliente_), or cooling (_frio_); and they\r\nbelieve that certain things are in opposition one to another, or, as the\r\nLimeños phrase it, _se oponen_. The presence in the stomach of two of\r\nthese opposing articles of food, for example, chocolate and rice, is\r\nbelieved to be highly dangerous, and sometimes fatal. It is amusing to\r\nobserve the Limeños when at dinner, seriously reflecting, before they\r\ntaste a particular dish, whether it is in opposition to something they\r\nhave already eaten. If they eat rice at dinner, they refrain from\r\ndrinking water, because the two things _se oponen_. To such an extreme\r\nis this notion carried, that they will not taste rice on days when they\r\nhave to wash, and laundresses never eat it. Frequently have I been asked\r\nby invalids whether it would be safe for them to take a foot-bath on\r\ngoing to bed, as they had eaten rice at dinner!\r\n\r\nThe white Creoles, as well as all the superior class of people in Lima,\r\nare exceedingly temperate in drinking. Water and a kind of sweet wine\r\nare their favorite beverage; but the lower classes and the people of\r\ncolor are by no means so abstemious. They make free use of fermented\r\ndrinks, especially brandy, chicha, and guarapo. The brandy of Peru is\r\nvery pure, and is prepared exclusively from the grape. On the warm sea\r\ncoast, the use of this liquor is not very injurious; there, its evil\r\neffects are counteracted by profuse perspiration. But one half the\r\nquantity that may be drunk with impunity on the coast, will be very\r\npernicious in the cool mountainous regions. An old and very just maxim\r\nof the Jesuits is, \"_En pais caliente, aguardiente; en pais frio, agua\r\nfria_\" (in the warm country, brandy; in the cold country, water).\r\n\r\nGuarapo is a fermented liquor, made of sugar-cane pulp and water. It\r\nis a very favorite beverage of the negroes. There are several kinds of\r\nguarapo. The best sorts are tolerably agreeable. _Chicha_ is a sort of\r\nbeer prepared from maize. The seeds of the maize are watered and left\r\nuntil they begin to sprout, after which they are dried in the sun.\r\nWhen sufficiently dry they are crushed, boiled in water, and then\r\nallowed to stand till fermentation takes place. The liquid is of a\r\ndark yellow color, and has a slightly bitter and sharp taste. Chicha\r\nis likewise made from rice, peas, barley, yuccas, pine-apples, and\r\neven bread. The kind most generally used is that made from maize. Even\r\nbefore the Spanish conquest of Peru, this maize beer was the common\r\nbeverage of the Indians. In Lima there are some very dirty and\r\nill-arranged _restaurations_, styled _picanterias_. These places are\r\ndivided by partitions into several small compartments, each of which\r\ncontains a table and two benches. The _restaurateur_, usually a zambo\r\nor a mulatto, prides himself in the superiority of his _picantes_ and\r\nhis _clicha_. The most motley assemblages frequent these places in the\r\nevening. The Congo negro, the grave Spaniard, the white Creole, the\r\nChino, together with monks and soldiers, may be seen, all grouped\r\ntogether, and devouring with evident relish refreshments, served out\r\nin a way not remarkable for cleanliness. Brandy and guarapo are\r\nlikewise sold in shops which are to be met with at the corner of\r\nalmost every street. The coffee-houses are very inferior; most of\r\nthem are very dirty, and the attendance is wretched.\r\n\r\nEvery street in Lima contains one or more cigar shops, in which\r\nmestizos and mulattos are busily employed in making cigars. Smoking is\r\na universal custom, and is practised everywhere except in the\r\nchurches. The cigars used in Lima are short, and the tobacco is rolled\r\nin paper, or in dried maize leaves. The tobacco is brought from the\r\nnorthern province, Jaen de Bracamoras, in very hard rolls called\r\n_masos_, about a yard long and two inches thick. Another kind of\r\ncigars is made of Peruvian or Columbian tobacco. They are scarcely\r\ninferior to the Havannah cigars, and would be quite equal to them, if\r\nthey were kept long enough and well dried: but in Lima they are smoked\r\nwithin a few hours after being made. When any one wants to light his\r\ncigar in the street, he accosts the first smoker he happens to meet,\r\nwhatever be his color, rank, or condition; and asks him for a light.\r\nThe slave smokes in the presence of his master, and when his cigar\r\ndies out, he unceremoniously asks leave to relight it at his master's.\r\nIt has been calculated that the daily cost of the cigars smoked in\r\nLima and the immediate vicinity amounts to 2,300 dollars.\r\n\r\nFormerly the market was held on the Plaza Mayor, and was always\r\nabundantly supplied with vegetables, fruit, and flowers. Now it is\r\nheld in the Plazuela de la Inquisicion, and it is very inferior to\r\nwhat it used to be. Along the sides of the Plaza are stalls kept by\r\nwomen, who sell sausages and fish. The central part of the market is\r\nappropriated to the sale of vegetables, of which there is always an\r\nexcellent supply. Facing the Palace of the Inquisition are the\r\nbutchers' shops. The meat is good, though not very plentifully\r\ndisplayed. The most abundant kinds of meat are mutton and beef. The\r\nslaughtering of young animals being strictly prohibited by law, veal,\r\nlamb, and sucking pigs are never seen in the market. The daily\r\nconsumption of butcher's meat in Lima is about twenty-eight or thirty\r\nheads of horned cattle, and between one hundred and sixty and two\r\nhundred sheep. Pork, neither fresh nor cured, is seen in the market;\r\nthough great numbers of swine are slaughtered. The fleshy parts of the\r\nanimal are cut into small square pieces, and boiled; the fat or lard\r\nis used in cookery, and the pieces of pork, which are spread over with\r\nlard, are called _chicharones_, and are held in high esteem by\r\nLimanian epicures. There is an abundant show of poultry in the market,\r\nespecially fowls and turkeys, which are brought from Huacho. Game is\r\nnever sold, and but very little is obtained in the neighborhood of\r\nLima. The flower market, which is held on the Plaza Mayor, is but\r\nsparingly supplied with the gifts of Flora. The ladies of Lima recal\r\npleasing recollections of the former glory of their flower market, and\r\nspeak with regret of its present degenerate condition. The\r\nmuch-vaunted _pucheros de flores_ are still occasionally displayed for\r\nsale. They are composed of a union of fragrant fruits and flowers.\r\nSeveral small fruits are laid on a banana leaf, and above them are\r\nplaced odoriferous flowers, tastefully arranged according to their\r\ncolors: the whole is surmounted with a strawberry, and is profusely\r\nsprinkled with _agua rica_, or lavender water. These _pucheros_ are\r\nvery pleasing to the eye, on account of the tasteful arrangement of\r\nthe flowers; but their powerful fragrance affects the nerves. They\r\nvary in price, according to the rarity of the fruits and flowers of\r\nwhich they are composed. Some cost as much as six or eight dollars.\r\nA _puchero de flores_ is one of the most acceptable presents that\r\ncan be offered to a Lima lady.\r\n\r\nA mingled feeling of disgust and surprise takes possession of the\r\nEuropean who witnesses the joy which pervades all classes of the\r\ninhabitants of Lima on the announcement of a bull-fight. For several\r\ndays the event is the exclusive topic of conversation, and, strange to\r\nsay, the female portion of the population takes greater interest in it\r\nthan the men. Bills notifying the approaching entertainment are stuck up\r\nat the corners of the streets; and every one is anxious to obtain a\r\n_lista de los toros_. When the season of the toros[36] commences, a\r\nbull-fight takes place every Monday, and then the whole city of Lima is\r\nthrown into a state of indescribable excitement. The ladies prepare\r\ntheir finest dresses for the occasion, and they consider it the greatest\r\npossible misfortune if anything occurs to prevent them going to the\r\nbull-fight: indeed, a Monday passed at home in the season of the toros\r\nwould be regarded as a lost day in the life of a Limeña. Those who\r\ncannot go to the _corrida_, resort to the bridge, or to the Alameda,\r\nwhere they sit and amuse themselves by looking at the throngs of people\r\npassing and repassing.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Viceroys, bull-fights frequently took place on the\r\nPlaza Mayor. Now there is a place expressly built for these\r\nentertainments, called the _Plaza firme del Acho_. It is a spacious\r\namphitheatre without a roof, and is erected at the end of the new avenue\r\nof the Alameda. The preparations for the sport commence at an early hour\r\nin the morning. Along the Alameda are placed rows of tables covered with\r\nrefreshments, consisting of lemonade, brandy, chicha, picantes, fish,\r\ndulces, &c. About twelve o'clock, those who have engaged places in the\r\namphitheatre begin to move towards the Plaza del Acho.\r\n\r\nMost European ladies would turn with horror, even from a description\r\nof these cruel sports, which the ladies of Lima gaze on with delight.\r\nThey are barbarous diversions, and though they form a part of national\r\ncustoms, they are nevertheless a national disgrace. At the same time\r\nit would be unjust to make this love of bull-fighting a ground for\r\nunqualified censure on the Limeños, or a reason for accusing them of\r\nan utter want of humanity. Being accustomed to these diversions from\r\nearly childhood, they regard them with perfect indifference; and\r\ncustom, no doubt, blinds them to the cruelties they witness in the\r\nbull-ring. The same extenuation may be urged in behalf of the women:\r\nand though to most of the Limeñas a bull-fight affords the highest\r\npossible gratification, yet there are some who form honorable\r\nexceptions to this remark, and who, with true feminine feeling, shrink\r\nwith horror from such scenes.\r\n\r\nPeru is the only one of the South American states in which bull-fights\r\nare included in the category of public amusements. As Peru was the last\r\nto answer the cry of independence, and to shake off the yoke of Spanish\r\ndomination, so she adheres with most tenacity to the customs of the\r\nmother country; for she has not the energy requisite for developing a\r\nnationality of her own. Even here is apparent that want of independence\r\nof character for which the Peruvians are remarkable. The faults of the\r\nSpaniards in them become vices, because, in imitating without\r\nreflecting, they push everything to an extreme. Thus, if bull-fights are\r\ncruel in Spain, they are barbarous in Lima. The government, too, finds\r\nit expedient to court popularity by favoring public entertainments,\r\namong which bull-fights take the lead. By allowing the people to indulge\r\nunrestrainedly in all their favorite amusements, the government gains a\r\ntwo-fold object, viz., that of securing the support, if not the love of\r\nthe people, and of averting public attention from political affairs.\r\nThese, it must be confessed, are important objects in a country which,\r\nlike Peru, is continually disturbed by revolutions caused by the\r\noutbreaks of a turbulent populace, or an undisciplined army.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: A very small number in a population of 55,000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Puquio_ in the Quichua language signifies springs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: These fine blocks of ice clearly refute the assertion\r\nmade by some travellers, that the first real glaciers are found in\r\n19° S. lat.

It may, however, be mentioned that the longitude from\r\nGreenwich is very differently stated. In sea charts and Manuals of\r\nGeography it is often marked 76° 50'. Humboldt makes it 77° 5' 5''; and\r\nMalaspina 77° 6' 45''. According to Ulloa it is 70° 37' west of Cadiz.\r\nThe latitude is very generally fixed at 12° 2' 3'' south. The height\r\nabove the level of the sea is also differently estimated. Rivero, in the\r\n_Memorial de Ciencias Naturales_, I., 2, page 112, states it to be 154\r\nmetres, or 462 French feet. On another occasion he makes it 184-4/5\r\nCastilian varas (each vara being equal to 33 inches English). He gives\r\nthe following account of heights, according to the barometer, between\r\nCallao and Lima, in varas, viz., Callao, 00; Baquijano, 24-3/5; _La\r\nLegua_, 50-2/5; Mirones, 94-3/20; Portada del Callao, 150; _Plaza de\r\nLima_, 184-4/5.\r\n\r\nThe first estimate given by Rivero is the most correct. Gay makes the\r\nheight of Lima, at the corner of the church of _Espiritu Santo_, 172·2\r\nCastilian varas; but most of his heights are incorrectly stated.\r\n\r\nThe conical hill in the north-east of Lima, called Cerro de San\r\nCristoval, is, according to trigonometrical measurements, made in 1737,\r\nby Don Jorge Juon, and De la Condamines, 312 varas higher than the Plaza\r\nMayor, or 134 toises above the sea; but one of the most exact\r\nmeasurements is Pentland's, who found the height to be 1275 English\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe average temperature during the hottest period of the year, from\r\nDecember to March, is 25° C. The medium temperature during the cold\r\nseason, from April to November, 17·5° C. Highest rise of the hygrometer,\r\n21·5°.\r\n\r\nThe low temperature of Lima at the distance of only twelve degrees from\r\nthe Equator is to be ascribed to the situation of the town, and the\r\nprevailing atmospheric currents. The Cordilleras, rising at the distance\r\nof only twenty-eight Spanish leagues east of the city, are crowned with\r\neternal snow; and on the west the sea is distant only two leagues. The\r\nprevailing wind blows from the south-south-west. West winds are not very\r\ncommon, though they sometimes blow with extraordinary violence for those\r\nregions, and breaking on the surrounding mountains, they form\r\natmospheric whirlwinds, which diffuse alarm through the whole\r\npopulation. In June, 1841, I had the opportunity of observing one of\r\nthese dreadful whirlwinds, which swept away huts, and tore up trees by\r\nthe roots. The atmospheric currents from the north, which pass over the\r\nhot sand-flats, are not of constant occurrence, but they are\r\noppressively sultry. There must be other causes for the low temperature\r\nof Lima, for in the villages, only a few miles from the city, and\r\nexposed to the same atmospheric influences, it is much higher.\r\n\r\nMiraflores is a small place, about one Spanish league and a half from\r\nLima, but it is much hotter. Among the records of the thermometer are\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n  December 20 to 27, maximum 31·8° C.; minimum, 25·9° C.\r\n\r\n  December 28, at 6 in the morning, 26·0° C.; at 2 P.M., 32·7° C.;\r\n    at 10 at night, 27·3° C.\r\n\r\n  January 1, at 2 P.M., 33·1° C., maximum of the day.\r\n\r\n  January 18, at 2 P.M., maximum 34·2° C.\r\n\r\nA comparison with the temperature of Lima, on the same days, gives an\r\naverage of 5·7° C. of heat in favor of Miraflores.\r\n\r\nThe River Rimac, which rises among the glaciers of the Cordilleras, and\r\nafter a course of no great length, intersects the city, doubtless\r\ncontributes to cool the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Lima is agreeable, but not very healthy. During six\r\nmonths, from April to October, a heavy, damp, but not cold mist,\r\noverhangs the city. The summer is always hot, but not oppressive. The\r\ntransition from one season to another is gradual, and almost\r\nimperceptible. In October and November the misty canopy begins to rise;\r\nit becomes thinner, and yields to the penetrating rays of the sun. In\r\nApril the horizon begins to resume the misty veil. The mornings are cool\r\nand overcast, but the middle of the day is clear. In a few weeks after,\r\nthe brightness of noon also disappears. The great humidity gives rise to\r\nmany diseases, particularly fevers, and the alternations from heat to\r\ndamp cause dysentery. On an average, the victims to this disease are\r\nvery numerous. It is endemic, and becomes, at apparently regular but\r\ndistant periods, epidemic. The intermittent fevers or agues, called\r\n_tercianos_, are throughout the whole of Peru very dangerous, both\r\nduring their course and in their consequences. It may be regarded as\r\ncertain that two-thirds of the people of Lima are suffering at all times\r\nfrom _tercianos_, or from the consequences of the disease. It usually\r\nattacks foreigners, not immediately on their arrival in Lima, but some\r\nyears afterwards. In general the tribute of acclimation is not so soon\r\npaid by emigrants in Lima as in other tropical regions.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the ignorance of the medical attendants, and the\r\nneglect of the police, the statistical tables of deaths are very\r\nimperfectly drawn up, and therefore cannot be entirely depended upon.\r\nI may, however, here subjoin one of them, which will afford the reader\r\nsome idea of the mortality of Lima.\r\n\r\nThe annual number of deaths in Lima varies from 2,500 to 2,800.\r\n\r\nIn the ten months, from the 1st of January to the 30th of October, 1841,\r\nthe number of marriages was 134, of which 46 were contracted by whites,\r\nand 88 by people of color.\r\n\r\n\r\n        DEATHS IN LIMA FROM JANUARY 1, TO OCTOBER 30, 1841:-\r\n\r\n  Diseases.

These are most decided proofs of the immorality and\r\ndegraded state of manners prevailing in Lima, particularly among the\r\ncolored part of the population. Though there is no certain evidence of\r\nthe fact, yet there is reason to conjecture that a considerable number\r\nof those infants are destroyed by the mothers. Of the children born out\r\nof marriage, nearly two-thirds, and of those exposed dead, full\r\nfour-fifths are Mulattos.\r\n\r\nThe important annual surplus of deaths over births is a matter of\r\nserious consideration for Lima. The above tables show, in the course of\r\nten months, a surplus of 562 deaths. By a comparison of the lists of\r\nbirths and deaths from 1826 to 1842, I find that on an average there are\r\nannually 550 more deaths than births. It would lead me too far to\r\nendeavor to investigate all the grounds of this disparity, but I may\r\nobserve that one of the causes, unquestionably, is the common, though\r\npunishable crime of producing abortion.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole coast of Peru the atmosphere is almost uniformly in a\r\nstate of repose. It is not illuminated by the lightning's flash, or\r\ndisturbed by the roar of the thunder: no deluges of rain, no fierce\r\nhurricanes destroy the fruits of the fields, and with them the hopes of\r\nthe husbandman. Even fire appears here to have lost its annihilating\r\npower, and the work of human hands seems to be sacred from its\r\nattack.[37] But the mildness of the elements above ground is frightfully\r\ncounterbalanced by their subterranean fury.\r\n\r\nLima is frequently visited by earthquakes, and several times the city\r\nhas been reduced to a mass of ruins. At an average forty-five shocks may\r\nbe counted on in a year. Most of them occur in the latter part of\r\nOctober, in November, December, January, May, and June. Experience gives\r\nreason to expect the visitation of two desolating earthquakes in a\r\ncentury. The period between the two is from forty to sixty years. The\r\nmost considerable catastrophes experienced in Lima since Europeans have\r\nvisited the west coast of South America, happened in the years 1586,\r\n1630, 1687, 1713, 1746, 1806. There is reason to fear that in the course\r\nof a few years this city may be the prey of another such visitation.\r\n\r\nThe slighter shocks are sometimes accompanied by a noise; at other\r\ntimes, they are merely perceptible by the motion of the earth. The\r\nsubterraneous noises are manifold. For the most part they resemble the\r\nrattling of a heavy loaded wagon, driven rapidly over arches. They\r\nusually accompany the shock, seldom precede it, and only in a few\r\ncases do they follow it; sounding like distant thunder. On one\r\noccasion the noise appeared to me like a groan from the depth of the\r\nearth, accompanied by sounds like the crepitation of wood in\r\npartitions when an old house is consumed by fire.\r\n\r\nOf the movements, the horizontal vibrations are the most frequent, and\r\nthey cause the least damage to the slightly-built habitations. Vertical\r\nshocks are most severe; they rend the walls, and raise the houses out of\r\ntheir foundations. The greatest vertical shock I ever felt was on the\r\n4th of July, 1839, at half-past seven in the evening, when I was in the\r\nold forests of the Chanchamoyo territory. Before my hut there was an\r\nimmense stem of a felled tree, which lay with its lower end on the stump\r\nof the root. I was leaning against it and reading, when suddenly, by a\r\nviolent movement, the stem rose about a foot and a half, and I was\r\nthrown backwards over it. By the same shock the neighboring river,\r\nAynamayo, was dislodged from its bed, and its course thereby changed for\r\na considerable length of way.\r\n\r\nI have had no experience of the rotatory movements of earthquakes.\r\nAccording to the statements of all who have observed them, they are very\r\ndestructive, though uncommon. In Lima I have often felt a kind of\r\nconcussion, which accords with that term in the strictest sense of the\r\nword. This movement had nothing in common with what may be called an\r\noscillation, a shock, or a twirl: it was a passing sensation, similar to\r\nthat which is felt when a man seizes another unexpectedly by the\r\nshoulder, and shakes him; or like the vibration felt on board a ship\r\nwhen the anchor is cast, at the moment it strikes the ground. I believe\r\nit is caused by short, rapid, irregular horizontal oscillations. The\r\nirregularity of the vibrations is attended by much danger, for very\r\nslight earthquakes of that kind tear away joists from their joinings,\r\nand throw down roofs, leaving the walls standing, which, in all other\r\nkinds of commotion, usually suffer first, and most severely.\r\n\r\nHumboldt says that the regularity of the hourly variations of the\r\nmagnetic needle and the atmospheric pressure is undisturbed on\r\nearthquake days within the tropics. In seventeen observations, which I\r\nmade during earthquakes in Lima with a good Lefevre barometer, I found,\r\nin fifteen instances, the position of the mercury quite unaltered. On\r\none occasion, shortly before a commotion, I observed it 2·4 lines lower\r\nthan it had been two hours before. Another time, I observed, also on\r\nthe approach of the shock and during the twelve following hours, a\r\nremarkable rising and sinking in the column. During these observations\r\nthe atmosphere was entirely tranquil.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric phenomena are frequent, but not infallible prognostics of\r\nan earthquake. I have known individuals in Lima, natives of the coast,\r\nwho were seldom wrong in predicting an earthquake, from their\r\nobservation of the atmosphere. In many places great meteors have been\r\nseen before the commotion. Before the dreadful earthquake of 1746,\r\nthere were seen fiery vapors (_exhalaciones encendidas_) rising out of\r\nthe earth. On the island of San Lorenzo these phenomena were\r\nparticularly remarked.\r\n\r\nMany persons have an obscure perception--a foreboding, which is to\r\nthem always indicative of an approaching earthquake. They experience a\r\nfeeling of anxiety and restlessness, a pressure of the breast, as if\r\nan immense weight were laid on it. A momentary shudder pervades the\r\nwhole frame, or there is a sudden trembling of the limbs. I, myself,\r\nhave several times experienced this foreboding, and there can scarcely\r\nbe a more painful sensation. It is felt with particular severity by\r\nthose who have already had the misfortune to have been exposed to the\r\ndangers of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nI will here only briefly mention the celebrated earthquake of 1746, as\r\nall its details are fully described in many publications. The reader\r\nneed scarcely be reminded that it happened on the 28th of October, the\r\nday of St. Simon and St. Jude. During the night, between ten and eleven\r\no'clock, the earth having begun to tremble, a loud howling was heard,\r\nand, in a few minutes, Lima became a heap of ruins. The first shock was\r\nso great, that the town was almost completely destroyed by it. Of more\r\nthan 3000 houses, only twenty-one remained. Still more horrible was the\r\ndestruction in the harbor of Callao. The movement of the earth had\r\nscarcely been felt there, when the sea, with frightful roaring, rushed\r\nover the shore, and submerged the whole town with its inhabitants. Five\r\nthousand persons were instantly buried beneath the waves. The Spanish\r\ncorvette San Fermin, which lay at anchor in the port, was thrown over\r\nthe walls of the fortress. A cross still marks the place where the stern\r\nof the vessel fell. Three merchant vessels, heavily laden, suffered the\r\nsame fate. The other ships which were at anchor, nineteen in number,\r\nwere sunk. The number of lives sacrificed by this earthquake has not\r\nbeen, with perfect accuracy, recorded.[38] Humboldt, in his Cosmos,\r\nmentions that during this earthquake a noise like subterraneous thunder\r\nwas heard at Truxillo, eighty-five leagues north of Callao. It was first\r\nobserved a quarter of an hour after the commotion occurred at Lima, but\r\nthere was no trembling of the earth. According to the old chronicle\r\nwriters, the earthquake of 1630 was more disastrous.\r\n\r\nThe serious commotions which take place on the Peruvian coast appear to\r\nacquire progressively greater extension, but only in the southern and\r\nnorthern directions. A shock, of which Lima is the centre, though felt\r\nfifty leagues towards the north, and as far towards the south, may,\r\nnevertheless, be imperceptible in the easterly direction (towards the\r\nmountains) at the distance of ten or twelve leagues. This peculiarity is\r\nmade manifest, not only by the terraqueous oscillations, but also by the\r\nundulations of the sound, which usually proceeds still further in a\r\ndirection towards the south or the north.\r\n\r\nSlight shocks are usually only local, and are not felt beyond the limits\r\nof a few square miles.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric phenomena during and after earthquakes are very\r\ndifferent. In general, the atmosphere is tranquil, but occasionally a\r\nstormy agitation is the harbinger of a change. I was unexpectedly\r\novertaken by a violent commotion on the sand-flat between Chancay and\r\nLima. The whole surface of the plain presented a kind of curling\r\nmovement, and on every side small columns of sand rose, and whirled\r\nround and round. The mules stopped of their own accord, and spread out\r\ntheir legs as for support and to secure themselves against\r\napprehended danger. The _arieros_ (mule-drivers) leaped from their\r\nsaddles, threw themselves on their knees beside the animals, and\r\nprayed to heaven for mercy.\r\n\r\nThe effect of earthquakes on the fertility of the soil is sometimes\r\nremarkable. Numerous observations tend to show that after violent\r\ncommotions luxuriant lands often become barren wastes, and for several\r\nyears produce no thriving vegetation. Several Quebradas in the province\r\nof Truxillo, formerly remarkable for their fertility in grain, were left\r\nfallow for twenty years after the earthquake of 1630, as the soil would\r\nproduce nothing. Similar cases occurred at Supe, Huaura, Lima, and Yca.\r\nAll kinds of grain appear to be very susceptible to the changes produced\r\nby earthquakes. Cases are recorded in which, after slight shocks, fields\r\nof maize in full bloom have withered; and in the course of a day or two\r\nthe crops have perished.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the frequent earthquakes on the coast of Lima are\r\ninvolved in an obscurity too deep to be unveiled. That they are\r\nconnected with volcanic phenomena seems probable. Lima is more than\r\nninety leagues distant from the nearest active volcano, that of\r\nArequipa. But the earthquakes of the Peruvian capital are uniformly\r\nindependent of any state of activity in that volcano, and it is\r\ncertain that the town of Arequipa, which lies at the foot of the\r\nmountain, experiences fewer earthquakes than Lima. Of the six serious\r\nearthquakes, the dates of which I have mentioned, only that of 1687\r\nstands in connection with a decided shock in Arequipa, and an eruption\r\nof the volcano. Earthquakes are of rarer occurrence in the mountainous\r\ndistricts than on the coast, yet Huancavellica, Tarma, Pasco,\r\nCaramarca, have been visited by heavy shocks; and within a recent\r\nperiod the village Quiquijana, in the Province of Quipichanchi,\r\nDepartment of Cusco, suffered from a serious commotion. In a letter\r\nfrom an eye-witness I received the following account of it.\r\n\r\n\"In November, 1840, the earth began to move faintly back and forward,\r\nand a dull, distant, subterraneous noise continued without interruption.\r\nThe first powerful shock occurred on the 23d of December. During the\r\nwhole month of January, 1841, heavy thunder prevailed, but without any\r\nmotion of the earth. On February 11th, we again had a smart shock, and\r\nfrom that day the vibrations recommenced, which, strange enough, were\r\nalways most violent on Mondays and Thursdays. The subterraneous noise\r\nresounded incessantly; but it was heard only in the village; for at the\r\ndistance of half a league from it all was tranquil. The heaviest shocks\r\nwere felt in a circuit within the radius of three leagues. From May 21st\r\nto June 2d, all was tranquil; after the last-mentioned date the\r\nvibrations recommenced, and frequently became heavy commotions. They\r\ncontinued until the middle of July, 1841. From that time we have not\r\nbeen disturbed, and we have now returned to the ruins of our village.\"\r\n\r\nThe volcano of Arequipa, which is forty-five leagues distant from\r\nQuiquijana, manifested, during the whole of this time, no unusual\r\nphenomena, a circumstance which speaks forcibly against the idea of any\r\nlocal connection between the earthquake and the volcano.\r\n\r\nOn most men earthquakes make a powerful and extraordinary impression.\r\nThe sudden surprise, often in sleep, the imminent danger, the\r\nimpossibility of escape, the dull subterraneous noise, the yielding of\r\nthe earth under the feet,--altogether make a formidable demand on the\r\nweakness of human nature.\r\n\r\nHumboldt in the Cosmos truly observes--\"What is most wonderful for us to\r\ncomprehend is the undeception which takes place with respect to the kind\r\nof innate belief which men entertain of the repose and immovability of\r\nthe terrestrial strata.\" And further on he says--\"The earthquake appears\r\nto men as something omnipresent and unlimited. From the eruption of a\r\ncrater, from a stream of lava running towards our dwellings, it appears\r\npossible to escape, but in an earthquake, whichever way flight is\r\ndirected the fugitive believes himself on the brink of destruction!\" No\r\nfamiliarity with the phenomenon can blunt this feeling. The inhabitant\r\nof Lima who, from childhood, has frequently witnessed these convulsions\r\nof nature, is roused from his sleep by the shock, and rushes from his\r\napartment with the cry of \"_Misericordia!_\" The foreigner from the north\r\nof Europe, who knows nothing of earthquakes but by description, waits\r\nwith impatience to feel the movement of the earth, and longs to hear\r\nwith his own ears the subterraneous sounds which he has hitherto\r\nconsidered fabulous. With levity he treats the apprehension of a coming\r\nconvulsion, and laughs at the fears of the natives. But as soon as his\r\nwish is gratified he is terror-stricken, and is involuntarily prompted\r\nto seek safety in flight.\r\n\r\nIn Lima, the painful impression produced by an earthquake is heightened\r\nby the universality of the exercise of the devotions (_plegarias_) on\r\nsuch a calamity. Immediately on the shock being felt, a signal is given\r\nfrom the cathedral, and the long-measured ten-minute tollings of all the\r\nchurch bells summon the inhabitants to prayers.\r\n\r\nTaking a comprehensive view of the whole coast of Peru, we perceive\r\nthat Lima lies in one of those oases which break the continuity of the\r\nextensive sand-flats. These valleys present themselves wherever a\r\nriver, after a short course from the Cordilleras, falls into the sea;\r\nthey are always fan-shaped widenings of the mountain ravines. The\r\nvalley of Lima lies in the widest extension of the Quebrada of\r\nMutucamas. This narrow gorge, which has its main direction from E.N.E.\r\nto W.S.W., widens at Cocachacra, and extends into San Pedro Mama,\r\nwhere the Quebrada of San Geronimo unites with it. It then runs down\r\nto the coast, extending more and more in width, and is intersected by\r\nthe Rimac.[39] This river rises in two branches, the largest of which\r\nhas its source in some small lagunes, in the upper part of Antarangra,\r\non a height 15,600 feet above the level of the sea. The second and\r\nshorter branch takes its source from a small lake in the heights of\r\nCarampoma, flows through the valley of San Geronimo, and near San\r\nPedro unites with the Rimac. The most considerable streams of the\r\nsouth-eastern confluence are those which rise in the heights of\r\nCarhuapampa, and near Tambo de Viso, flow into the main stream. During\r\nwinter the Rimac is very inconsiderable, but when the rainy season\r\nsets in it swells greatly, and in the upper regions, particularly\r\nbetween Surco and Cocachacra, causes great devastations. In the lower\r\npart where the bed becomes broad and the banks are not much built on,\r\nno considerable damage occurs.\r\n\r\nSeveral small conduits are brought from the Rimac, some for giving\r\nmoisture to fields, and others for filling the street trenches of Lima.\r\nThe water for supplying the fountains of the Capital does not, however,\r\ncome from the river, but from two springs situated 1-1/4 league from\r\nLima in a thicket near an old Indian settlement, called Santa Rosa, in\r\nthe valley of Surco. They are inclosed within a building called the\r\nPuello, or Atarrea, whence the waters are conveyed by a subterraneous\r\ntrench to the Reservoir (Caja de Santa Tomas), from which it is\r\ndistributed by pipes to 112 public and private fountains. During the\r\ninsurrection of the Indians in 1781, which was instigated by the\r\nunfortunate Cacique Don José Gabriel Tupac Amaru, one of the sworn\r\ndeterminations of the participators in that very extensive conspiracy\r\nwas to drive the Spaniards out of Lima by artifice or force. Among the\r\nnumerous plans for accomplishing that object, I will mention two which\r\nhave reference to the water of Lima. One scheme was to poison the whole\r\nof the inhabitants. For this purpose a rich Cacique of the vale of\r\nHuarochirin went to an apothecary near the bridge, and asked for two\r\nhundred weight of corrosive sublimate, saying that he would pay well for\r\nit. The apothecary had not entire confidence in the Indian, but he did\r\nnot think it right to forego the opportunity of making a very profitable\r\nsale; so, instead of the sublimate, he made up the same quantity of alum\r\nfor the Cacique and received the price he demanded. Next morning all the\r\nwater in Lima was unfit for use. On examination it was found that the\r\nenclosure of the Atarrea was broken down, and the source saturated with\r\nalum. The offender remained undiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe second plan was formed with more circumspection. The conspirators\r\nresolved on a certain day to send into the city a number of Indians, who\r\nwere to conceal themselves on the roofs of the shops (_Pulperias_), in\r\nwhich quantities of firewood were kept for sale. The moment the\r\ncathedral struck the hour of midnight, the concealed Indians were to set\r\nfire to the wood. Another division of Indians was immediately to dam up\r\nthe river at the convent of Santa Clara, and thereby lay the streets\r\nunder water. During the unavoidable confusion, which must have taken\r\nplace, the main body of the Indians was to enter the town and massacre\r\nall the whites. This well-combined plan was by mere accident discovered,\r\nwhen it was of course frustrated.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of the soil round Lima is very great when irrigation is\r\npracticable. Where this cannot be accomplished, the earth withholds\r\neven the most scanty vegetation. The _riego_, or irrigation, is thus\r\neffected. On certain days the water conduits are closed, and the\r\nfields are laid under water. When there is a deficient supply of\r\nwater, the trenches, or conduits, are not opened till the following\r\nday. When, however, the supply of water is abundant, the _riego_ takes\r\nplace early every morning.\r\n\r\nAs the same identical plants are cultivated along almost the whole\r\ncoast, I will here notice them, to save the necessity of returning to\r\nthem hereafter.\r\n\r\nCOTTON is cultivated only in a few plantations in the immediate\r\nvicinity of Lima; but it abounds more in the northern districts,\r\nparticularly in the department de la Libertad, in the coast province\r\nPiura, in Lambayeque, and in Truxillo. In the southern province, Yca,\r\na considerable quantity is also reared for exportation. The brown\r\ncotton was chiefly cultivated in the time of the Incas. Most of the\r\nbodies found in the ancient graves on the coast are enveloped in\r\nthis kind of cotton.\r\n\r\nThe SUGAR CANE is cultivated with success in all plantations where\r\nthere is sufficient moisture of soil; and of all the agricultural\r\nproduce of the country, yields the greatest profit. The sugar estates\r\nlie on the sea-coast, or along the banks of rivers. The vertical limit\r\nof the sugar cane growth is on the western declivity of the\r\nCordilleras, about 4500 feet above the level of the sea, at which\r\nheight I saw fields covered with it. The largest plantations, however,\r\ndo not rise above 1200 feet above the level of the sea; while those of\r\nthe same extent on the eastern declivity are at the height of 6000\r\nfeet. Within the last forty years the introduction of the Otaheitan\r\ncane has greatly improved the Peruvian plantations in quality, and has\r\nmore especially increased the quantity of their produce; for the\r\nOtaheitan canes are found to yield proportionally one third more than\r\nthe West India canes, which were previously cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the sugar is, as yet, conducted in a very rude and\r\nlaborious manner. In most of the plantations the cane is passed through\r\nwooden presses with brass rollers. These machines are called _trapiches_\r\nor _ingenios_. They are kept in motion by oxen or mules. In some large\r\nestates water power is employed, and in San Pedro de Lurin a\r\nsteam-engine has been put up, which certainly does the work quickly; but\r\nit often has to stand for a long time idle. A part of the sugar cane\r\njuice is used for making the liquor called guarapo, or distilled for\r\nmaking rum; for since the independence, the law which strictly\r\nprohibited the distillation of spirituous liquors in plantations has\r\nbeen repealed. The remainder is boiled down into a syrup, or further\r\nsimmered until it thickens into cakes, called chancacas, or brown sugar.\r\nAfter a careful purification it is made into the white cakes called\r\nalfajores, or prepared as white sugar. In fineness of grain and purity\r\nof color it is inferior to the Havannah sugar, which, however, it\r\nexceeds in sweetness. The regular weight of the sugarloaf is two arobas;\r\nonly for convenience of transport into the mountainous districts their\r\nweight is sometimes diminished. The consumption of sugar in the country\r\nis great and its export is considerable, but it goes only to Chile.\r\n\r\nOf the different kinds of grain, maize is most generally and most\r\nsuccessfully cultivated in Peru. It grows on the sandy shore, in the\r\nfertile mountain valleys, and on the margin of the forest, where the\r\nwarmth is great. There are several varieties of maize, which are\r\ndistinguished one from another by the size of the head and by the form\r\nand appearance of the grain. The most common kinds on the coast\r\nare--1st, the _Mais Morocho_, which has small bright yellow or reddish\r\nbrown grains; 2d, the _Mais Amarillo_, of which the grain is large,\r\nheart-shaped, solid and opaque; 3d, _Mais Amarillo de Chancay_, similar\r\nto the _Mais Amarillo_, but with a semi-transparent square-shaped grain,\r\nand an elongated head. The Morocho and Amarillo maize are chiefly\r\nplanted in the eastern declivity of the Andes. They run up in stalks\r\neight or nine feet high, and have enormously large heads. In one of them\r\nI counted seventy-five grains in a single row.\r\n\r\nMaize forms the bread of the Peruvians. It is almost the only sustenance\r\nof the Indians of the mountains, and is the principal food of the slaves\r\non the coast. Like the potatoe in Europe, it is cooked in a variety of\r\nways. Two of the most simple preparations of maize are those called\r\n_choclas_ and _mote_. _Choclas_ are the unripe maize heads merely soaked\r\nin warm water; they form a very agreeable and wholesome article of food.\r\n_Mote_ consists of ripe maize first boiled and then laid in hot ashes,\r\nafter which the husks are easily stripped off.\r\n\r\nAs to whether maize is indigenous to Peru, or when it was introduced\r\nthere, much has already been written, and I shall refrain from entering\r\ninto the investigation of the question here. I may, however, mention\r\nthat I have found very well preserved ears of maize in tombs, which,\r\njudging from their construction, belong to a period anterior to the\r\ndynasty of the Incas; and these were fragments of two kinds of maize\r\nwhich do not now grow in Peru. If I believed in the transmigration and\r\nsettlement of Asiatic races on the west coast of America, I should\r\nconsider it highly probable that maize, cotton, and the banana, had been\r\nbrought from Asia to the great west coast. But the supposed epoch of\r\nthis alleged immigration must carry us back to the earliest ages; for,\r\nthat the Incas were (as the greater number of inquirers into Peruvian\r\nhistory pretend) of Asiatic origin, is a mere vague hypothesis,\r\nunsupported by anything approximating to historical proof.\r\n\r\nSince the earthquake of 1687 the crops of maize on the Peruvian coast\r\nhave been very inconsiderable. In the mountainous parts it is somewhat\r\nmore abundant, but still far from sufficient to supply the wants of the\r\ncountry. Chile supplies, in return for sugar, the maize required in\r\nPeru. Of the other kinds of grain barley only is raised; but it does not\r\nthrive on the coast, and is cultivated successfully at the height of\r\nfrom 7000 to 13,200 feet above the level of the sea. The assertion of\r\nsome travellers, that barley was known to the Peruvians before the\r\narrival of the Spaniards, is groundless. It is true that barley is\r\nsometimes found in pots in Indian graves. Those graves, however, as I\r\nhave had repeated opportunities of being convinced, belong, without\r\nexception, to modern times, chiefly to the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nPotatoes are not planted on the coast, where, it appears, the climate\r\nand soil are unfavorable to them. In those parts they are small and\r\nwatery. On the higher ridges which intersect the coast at short\r\ndistances from the sea, the potatoe grows wild. I am inclined to believe\r\nthat the root is indigenous in these parts, as well as in Chiloe and\r\nChile, and that the ancient Peruvians did not obtain this root from the\r\nsouth, but that they removed it from their own high lands in order to\r\ncultivate it on a more favorable soil.[40] The best potatoe grows about\r\ntwenty-two leagues from Lima, in Huamantanga, which is about 7000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, to the north-west of the Quebrada of Canta.\r\nThis potatoe is small and round, with a thin white skin, and when\r\nbisected the color is a clear bright yellow. It is called the _Papa\r\namarilla_, and there is much demand for it in the markets, where it\r\nfetches a good price. The other potatoes come chiefly from the Quebrada\r\nof Huarochirin, and they are very well flavored.\r\n\r\nThe Camotes (_Convolvulus batatas_, L.), not improperly called sweet\r\npotatoes, grow to a considerable size. There are two kinds of camotes,\r\nthe yellow and the violet; the latter are called _Camotes moradas_.\r\nThese two kinds are much liked for their excellent flavor. Beyond the\r\nheight of 3500 feet above the level of the sea they cease to grow.\r\n\r\nThe Aracacha (_Conium moschatum_, H. B. Kth.) grows on the coast, but it\r\nis more abundant on the projecting ridges of the Cordilleras, and on the\r\neastern declivity of the Andes. It is a very agreeable and nutritive\r\nkind of tuberous vegetable, in flavor not unlike celery. It is cooked by\r\nbeing either simply boiled in water, or made into a kind of soup. In\r\nmany districts the aracacha yields two crops in the year.\r\n\r\nThe Yucca (_Jatropha manihot_) is one of the finest vegetables of\r\nPeru. The stalk of the plant is between five and six feet high, and\r\nabout the thickness of a finger. The roots are from one to two feet\r\nlong, somewhat of the turnip form. Internally they are pure white; but\r\nthe external skin is tough, somewhat elastic, and of a reddish-brown\r\ncolor. The roots are the edible parts of the plant. They are very\r\nagreeable in taste, and easy of digestion. When raw they are hard and\r\ntough, and their taste somewhat resembles chestnuts. When boiled in\r\nwater the root separates into fibres, and is rather waxy, but when\r\nlaid in hot ashes it becomes mealy.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Peru the Indians prepare a very fine flour from the\r\nyucca, and it is used for making fine kinds of bread, and especially a\r\nkind of biscuits called _biscochuelos_. The yucca roots are not good\r\nafter they have been more than three days out of the earth, and even\r\nduring that time they must be placed in water, otherwise green or black\r\nstripes appear on them, which in the cooking assume a pale red color.\r\nTheir taste is then disagreeable, and they quickly become rotten.\r\n\r\nTo propagate the yucca the stalk is cut, particularly under the thick\r\npart, into span-long pieces, which are stuck obliquely into the earth.\r\nIn five or six months the roots are fit for use, but they are usually\r\nallowed to remain some time longer in the earth. The stalks are\r\nsometimes cut off, and the roots left in the earth. They then put forth\r\nnew leaves and flowers, and after sixteen or eighteen months they become\r\nslightly woody. The Indians in the Montaña de Vitoc sent as a present to\r\ntheir officiating priest a yucca, which weighed thirty pounds, but yet\r\nwas very tender. On the western declivity of the Cordillera, the\r\nboundary elevation for the growth of the yucca is about 3000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea.\r\n\r\nAmong the pulse there are different kinds of peas (_garbanzos_) on the\r\ncoast; beans (_frijoles_), on the contrary, occupy the hilly grounds.\r\nAll vegetables of the cabbage and salad kinds cultivated in Europe will\r\ngrow in Peru. The climate, both of the coast and the hills, suits them\r\nperfectly; but the hot, damp temperature of the eastern declivity of the\r\nAndes is adverse to them. Numerous varieties of the genus _Cucurbita_\r\nare cultivated in the _chacras_, or Indian villages, on the coast. They\r\nare chiefly consumed by the colored population. I did not find them very\r\nagreeable to the taste. They are all sweetish and fibrous.\r\n\r\nAmong the edible plants which serve for seasoning or spicery, I must\r\nmention the love-apple (_Tomate_), which thrives well in all the warm\r\ndistricts of Peru; and the Spanish pepper (_Aji_), which is found only\r\non the coast and in the mild woody regions. There are many species of\r\nthe pepper (_Capsicum annuum, baccatum, frutescens, &c._), which are\r\nsometimes eaten green, and sometimes dried and pounded. In Peru the\r\nconsumption of aji is greater than that of salt; for with two-thirds of\r\nthe dishes brought to table, more of the former than of the latter is\r\nused. It is worthy of remark that salt diminishes, in a very striking\r\ndegree, the pungency of the aji; and it is still more remarkable that\r\nthe use of the latter, which in a manner may be called a superfluity,\r\nhas no injurious effect on the digestive organs. If two pods of aji,\r\nsteeped in warm vinegar, are laid as a sinapism on the skin, in the\r\nspace of a quarter of an hour the part becomes red, and the pain\r\nintolerable; within an hour the scarf-skin will be removed. Yet I have\r\nfrequently eaten twelve or fifteen of these pods without experiencing\r\nthe least injurious effect. However, before I accustomed myself to this\r\nluxury, it used to affect me with slight symptoms of gastritis. On the\r\neastern declivity of the Cordilleras I found no capsicum at a greater\r\nheight than 4800 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nLucern (_Medicago sativa_), called by the natives _alfa_ or _alfalfa_,\r\nis reared in great abundance throughout the whole of Peru, as fodder for\r\ncattle. It does not bear great humidity, nor severe heat or cold; yet\r\nits elevation boundary is about 11,100 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nOn the coast it flourishes very luxuriantly during the misty season; but\r\nduring the months of February and March it is almost entirely dried up.\r\nThe maisillo (_Paspalum purpureum_, R.) then supplies its place as\r\nfodder for cattle. In the mountainous districts it is also most abundant\r\nduring the humid season; but, as soon as the first frost sets in, it\r\ndecays, takes a rusty-brown color, and remains in a bad state until the\r\nbeginning of the rainy season. On an average, the _alfalfa_ may be cut\r\nfour times in the year; but in highlying districts only three times;\r\nand in humid soils on the coast, particularly in the neighborhood of\r\nrivers, five times. Once in every four or five years the clover-fields\r\nare broken up by the plough, and then sown with maize or barley. In the\r\nsixth year clover is again raised.\r\n\r\nThe olive-tree is cultivated chiefly in the southern provinces of the\r\ncoast. In flavor, its fruit approximates to the Spanish olive. That\r\nthe oil is not so fine is probably owing to the bad presses which are\r\nused, and the rude manner in which the operation is performed. The\r\nolives (_Aceytunas_) are preserved in a peculiar manner. They are\r\nallowed to ripen on the tree, when they are gathered, slightly\r\npressed, dried, and put up in small earthen vessels. By this process\r\nthey become shrivelled and quite black. When served up at table pieces\r\nof tomato and aji are laid on them: the latter is an excellent\r\naccompaniment to the oily fruit. Some preserve them in salt water, by\r\nwhich means they remain plump and green.\r\n\r\nThe castor-oil plant (_Ricinus communis_) grows wild, but it is also\r\ncultivated in many plantations. The considerable quantity of oil which\r\nis pressed out of the seeds is used unpurified in Lima for the street\r\nlamps, and also in the sugar plantations, for greasing the machines\r\nemployed in the works. The purified Ricinus oil required for medicine is\r\nimported from England or Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Piñoncillo tree (_Castiglionia lobata_, R.) is cultivated only about\r\nSurco, Huacho, and Lambayeque, in some of the Indian chacras; but it\r\ngrows wild in considerable abundance. Its bean-like fruit, when roasted,\r\nhas an agreeable flavor. When eaten raw, the etherial oil generated\r\nbetween the kernel and the epidermis is a strong aperient, and its\r\neffect can only be counteracted by drinking cold water. When an incision\r\nis made in the stem, a clear bright liquid flows out; but after some\r\ntime it becomes black and horny like. It is a very powerful caustic, and\r\nretains its extraordinary property for years.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the temperate climates of Europe thrive but indifferently\r\nin the warm regions of the coast of Peru. Apples and pears are for the\r\nmost part uneatable. Of stone fruits only the peach succeeds well. Vast\r\nquantities of apricots (called duraznos) grow in the mountain valleys.\r\nOf fifteen kinds which came under my observation, those called\r\n_blanquillos_ and _abridores_ are distinguished for fine flavor.\r\nCherries, plums, and chestnuts I did not see in Peru, yet I believe the\r\nclimate of the Sierra is very favorable to their growth. Generally\r\nspeaking, the interior of the country is well suited to all the fruits\r\nand grain of central Europe; and doubtless many of our forest trees\r\nwould flourish on those Peruvian hills which now present no traces of\r\nvegetation. But as yet no system of transplantation has been seriously\r\nset on foot. The praiseworthy attempts made by many Europeans, who have\r\nsent seeds and young plants to Peru, have failed of success, owing to\r\nthe indifference of the natives to the advancement of those objects.\r\n\r\nAll the fruits of southern Europe thrive luxuriantly in the warm regions\r\nof Peru. Oranges, pomegranates, lemons, limes, &c., grow in incredible\r\nabundance. Though the trees bloom and bear fruit the whole year round,\r\nyet there are particular times in which their produce is in the greatest\r\nperfection and abundance. On the coast, for example, at the commencement\r\nof winter, and in the woody districts in the months of February and\r\nMarch, melons and Sandyas (_water melons_) are particularly fine.\r\n\r\nThe figs are of two kinds: the one called _Higos_, and the other\r\n_Brevas_. In the former the pulp is red, in the latter it is white.\r\nThey are usually large, very soft, and may be ranked among the most\r\ndelicious fruits of the country. Fig-trees grow frequently wild in the\r\nneighborhood of the plantations and the Chacras: and the traveller may\r\npluck the fruit, and carry away a supply for his journey; for, beyond\r\na certain distance from Lima figs are not gathered, being a fruit not\r\neasy of transport in its fresh state; and when dried, it is not liked.\r\nPomegranates and quinces seldom grow on the coast: they are chiefly\r\nbrought to the Lima market from the neighboring Quebradas. The\r\nmulberry-tree flourishes luxuriantly and without cultivation; but its\r\nfruit is not thought worth gathering, and it is left as food for the\r\nbirds. In the southern province of Yca, the cultivation of the vine\r\nhas been attended by most successful results. In the neighborhood of\r\nLima grapes are seen only in a few Huertas (_orchards_); but for\r\nsize, sweetness, and aromatic flavor, there are no such grapes in any\r\nother part of the world.\r\n\r\nOf tropical fruits, the number is not so great in Peru as in the more\r\nnortherly district of Guayaquil. But there are some Peruvian fruits, the\r\ndelicious flavor of which cannot be excelled. One of these is the\r\nChirimoya (_Anona tripetala_). Hanke, in one of his letters, calls it \"a\r\nmaster-work of Nature.\" It would certainly be difficult to name any\r\nfruit possessing a more exquisite flavor.\r\n\r\nIn Lima the Chirimoya is comparatively small, often only the size of an\r\norange. Those who have tasted it only in Lima, can form but a very\r\nimperfect idea of its excellence. In Huanuco, its indigenous soil, it\r\ngrows in the greatest perfection, and often attains the weight of\r\nsixteen pounds, or upwards. The fruit is of roundish form, sometimes\r\npyramidal, or heart-shaped, the broad base uniting with the stem.\r\nExternally it is green, covered with small knobs and scales, and often\r\nhas black markings like net-work spread over it. When the fruit is very\r\nripe, it has black spots. The skin is rather thick and tough.\r\nInternally, the fruit is snow-white and juicy, and provided with a\r\nnumber of small seeds well covered with a delicate substance. The\r\nChirimoyas of Huanuco are also distinguished from those of the coast by\r\nhaving only from four to six seeds; whereas on the coast they are found\r\nwith from twenty-five to thirty. The question as to what the taste of\r\nthis fruit may be compared with, I can only answer by saying, that it is\r\nincomparable. Both the fruit and flowers of the Chirimoya emit a fine\r\nfragrance, which, when the tree is covered with blossom, is so strong as\r\nto be almost overpowering. The tree which bears this finest of all\r\nfruits is from fifteen to twenty feet high. It has a broad flat top, and\r\nis of a pale-green color.\r\n\r\nThe Palta (_Persea gatissima_, Gärt.) is a fruit of the pear form, and\r\ndark-brown in color. The rind is tough and elastic, but not very thick.\r\nThe edible substance, which is soft and green, encloses a kernel\r\nresembling a chestnut in form and color. This fruit is very astringent\r\nand bitter, and on being cut, a juice flows from it which is at first\r\nyellow, but soon turns black. The taste is peculiar, and at first not\r\nagreeable to a foreigner; but it is generally much liked when the palate\r\nbecomes accustomed to it. The fruit of the Palta dissolves like butter\r\non the tongue, and hence it is called in some of the French colonies\r\n_beurre végétale_. It is sometimes eaten without any accompaniment, and\r\nsometimes with a little salt, or with oil and vinegar. The kernels make\r\nvery good brandy. The Palta-tree is slender and very high, with a small\r\ndome-like top. On the eastern declivity of the Andes, I have seen some\r\nof these trees more than sixty feet high.\r\n\r\nThe Platanos (_Bananas_) thrive well in most of the Peruvian\r\nplantations. They require great heat and humidity. They grow in the\r\ngreatest perfection on the banks of small rivulets. On the coast the\r\ntree does not yield such abundance of fruit as in the woody regions,\r\nwhere it is not unusual to see a tree with three hundred heads of fruit\r\nlying one over another, like tiles on a roof. In the country adjacent to\r\nLima, and also on other parts of the coast, three favorite species are\r\ncultivated. The _Platano de la Isla_, or of Otaheite, was introduced\r\nfrom that archipelago in 1769. The fruits are from three to four inches\r\nlong, generally prismatic, as they grow thickly on the stem, and lie one\r\nover another. The skin is yellow, the fruit of a palish red, and rather\r\nmealy. The Limeños prefer this to any other species of the platano, and\r\nthey consider it the most wholesome. The fruits of the _Platano Guineo_\r\nare not longer, but much thicker than those of the _Platano de la Isla_,\r\nbut they are so full that they burst when quite ripe. They are straight\r\nand cylindrical in form, as they grow on the stem at some distance one\r\nfrom the other. They are of a bright yellow color, but near the stem\r\nspotted with black. The edible part is whiter and softer than that of\r\nthe _Platano de la Isla_, to which it is greatly superior in flavor and\r\naroma. The natives believe this fruit to be very unwholesome, and they\r\nmaintain that drinking brandy after eating Platanos Guineos causes\r\nimmediate death. This is, as my own often-repeated experiments have\r\nshown, one of the deep-rooted, groundless prejudices to which the\r\nPeruvians obstinately cling. On one of my excursions I had a controversy\r\non this subject with some persons who accompanied me. To prove how\r\nunfounded their notions were, I ate some platanos, and then washing down\r\none poison by the other, I immediately swallowed a mouthful of brandy.\r\nMy Peruvian friends were filled with dismay. Addressing me alternately\r\nin terms of compassion and reproach, they assured me I should never\r\nreturn to Lima alive. After spending a very agreeable day, we all\r\narrived quite well in the evening at Lima. At parting, one of my\r\ncompanions seriously observed that we should never see each other again.\r\nEarly next morning they anxiously called to inquire how I was, and\r\nfinding me in excellent health and spirits, they said:--\"Ah! you see, an\r\n_herege de gringo_ (a heretic of a foreigner) is quite of a different\r\nnature from us.\" A piece of the Platano Guineo soaked in brandy retains\r\nits color unchanged; but the rib-like fibres which connect the rind with\r\nthe pulp then become black, and imbibe a bitter taste.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the third kind of platano, the _Platano Largo_, is from six\r\nto eight inches long, rather narrow, and curved crescent-wise. The rind\r\nis of a light straw color, and when the fruit is very ripe it has large\r\nblack spots. The edible part is of a whitish hue, harder and drier than\r\nthat of the two species already described; and its flavor its quite as\r\nagreeable. Its fruit is less abundant than that of the Platano Guineo,\r\nand it requires longer time to become fully ripe. A fourth kind, which\r\ngrows in the forest regions, I have never seen on the coast. It is the\r\n_Platano Altahuillaca_. It bears at most from twenty to twenty-five\r\nheads of fruit. The stem is more than two inches thick, and above an ell\r\nlong. The color of the husk is light yellow, the enclosed substance is\r\nwhite, tough, and hard. In the raw state it is flavorless, but when\r\nroasted in hot ashes, or cooked with meat, it makes a fine dish.\r\n\r\nWhen the platanos of the uppermost row, that is, those which form the\r\nbase of the conical-formed reflex cluster, begin to turn yellow, or, as\r\nthe natives say, _pintar_, the whole is cut off, and hung up in an airy,\r\nshady situation, usually in an apartment of the Rancho, or hut, where it\r\nmay quickly ripen. The largest fruits are cut off as soon as they are\r\nyellow and soft, and so the cutting goes on gradually up to the top, for\r\nthey ripen so unequally that those at the base show symptoms of decay\r\nwhile those at the top are still hard and green. As soon as the\r\n_cabeza_, or cluster of fruit, is cut, the whole branch is immediately\r\nlopped off, in order to facilitate the shooting of the fresh sprouts.\r\nEach branch bears only one _cabeza_, and eight or ten months are the\r\nperiod usually required for its complete development.\r\n\r\nThe platanos belongs indisputably to the most useful class of fruit\r\ntrees, especially in regions where they can be cultivated extensively,\r\nfor then they may very adequately supply the place of bread. In\r\nnorthern Peru and Guayaquil, the platano fruit is prepared for food in\r\na variety of ways.\r\n\r\nPine-apples (_Ananas_) are not much cultivated on the coast of Peru. The\r\nmarket of Lima was formerly entirely supplied with this fruit from the\r\nMontaña de Vitoc. When brought from thence they used to be cut before\r\nthey were ripe, and packed on the backs of asses. The journey is of\r\nsixteen or twenty days' duration, and the road lies across two of the\r\nCordilleras. After being several days in the cold snowy region of the\r\nPuna, the fruit came to Lima in a very indifferent state; but since the\r\ncommunication by steam navigation with Guayaquil, pine-apples are\r\nbrought from the latter place in large quantities. They are large,\r\nsucculent, and very sweet.\r\n\r\nThe Granadilla (_Passiflora quadrangularis_) is about the size of an\r\napple, but rather oblong. The skin is reddish-yellow, hard, and rather\r\nthick. The edible part is grey and gelatinous, and it contains numerous\r\ndark-colored seeds. The fruit is very agreeable, and in taste resembles\r\nthe gooseberry, and is very cooling. The Granadilla is a shrub or bush,\r\nand it twines round the trunks of trees, or climbs up the walls of the\r\nRanchos. It is less abundant on the coast than in the adjacent valleys.\r\n\r\nThe Tunas are fruits of different species of Cactus. The husk, which is\r\ncovered with sharp prickles, is green, yellow, or red in color, and is\r\neasily separated from the pulp of the fruit. When being plucked, the\r\ntunas are rubbed with straw to remove the prickles, which, however, is\r\nnot always completely accomplished. It is therefore necessary to be\r\ncautious in handling the husks, for the small prickles cause\r\ninflammation when they get into the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe Pacay is the fruit of a tree of rather large size (_Prosopis\r\ndulcis_, Humb.), with a rather low and broad top. It consists of a pod\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-four inches long, enclosing black seeds, which are\r\nembedded in a white, soft, flaky substance. This flaky part is as white\r\nas snow, and is the only eatable part of the fruit. It tastes sweet,\r\nand, to my palate at least, it is very unpleasant; however, the Limeños\r\non the coast and the monkeys in the woods are very fond of the pacay.\r\n\r\nThe Lucuma is produced only in the southern provinces of the coast of\r\nPeru, and is chiefly imported from the north of Chile. The fruit is\r\nround. The grey-brown husk encloses a fibrous, dry, yellow-colored\r\nfruit with its kernel.\r\n\r\nThe Guayava (_Psidium pomiferum_) grows on a low shrub, chiefly in the\r\nvalleys of the coast, and on the eastern declivity of the Andes. It is\r\nof the form and size of a small apple. The rind is bright, yellow, and\r\nthin. The pulp is either white or red, and is full of little egg-shaped\r\ngranulations. Its flavor is pleasant, but not remarkably fine. In Lima\r\nit is not a favorite, for numerous insects lay their eggs in it, and,\r\nwhen the fruit is ripe, larvæ are found in it.\r\n\r\nThe Pepino (a _cucurbitacea_) is grown in great abundance in the fields.\r\nThe plant is only a foot and a half high, and it creeps on the ground.\r\nThe fruit is from four to five inches long, cylindrical, and at both\r\nends somewhat pointed. The husk is of a yellowish green color, with long\r\nrose-colored stripes. The pulp or edible part is solid, juicy, and\r\nwell-flavored. The kernel lies in the middle, in a long-shaped furrow.\r\nBy the natives the pepino is, and not altogether unreasonably, believed\r\nto be injurious. They maintain that this fruit is too cold in the\r\nstomach, and that a glass of brandy is necessary to counteract its\r\ninjurious properties. This much is certain, that the pepinos are very\r\nindigestible, and that eating them frequently, or at improper times,\r\nbrings on fits of illness.\r\n\r\nThe Mani, or Earth Almond (_Arachis hypogæa_), is produced in the\r\nnorthern provinces. The plant is from a foot and a half to two feet\r\nlong, and very leafy. The kernels have a grey, shrivelled husk: they\r\nare white, and contain much oil. When roasted and crushed, they are\r\neaten with sugar.\r\n\r\nThe Capulies (_Prunus capulin_, Ser.) grows in the open fields. In towns\r\nit is planted in gardens or in pots. The fruit is a little bigger than a\r\ncherry. It is of a deep yellow color, and has an acid taste. The\r\ncapulies are not frequently eaten. On account of their very pleasant\r\nodor, they are used in making _Pucheros de_ flores, or with other\r\nodoriferous flowers, they are besprinkled with agua rica, and laid in\r\ndrawers to perfume linen. The ladies of Lima wear them in their bosoms.\r\nThe same uses are made of the Palillos (_Campomanesia lineatifolia_,\r\nR.), which grow on trees from twenty to thirty feet high. The bright\r\nyellow fruit is as large as a moderately-sized apple. The palillo emits\r\nan exceedingly agreeable scent, and is one of the ingredients used in\r\nmaking the perfumed water called _mistura_. When rubbed between the\r\nfingers, the leaves smell like those of the myrtle; but they have an\r\nacid and a stringent taste.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Peru is poorly supplied with Palm-trees, either wild or\r\ncultivated. The Cocoa Palm is grown only in a few of the northern\r\nprovinces, and the Date Palm chiefly about Yca. With a very little\r\ncare, these trees would thrive excellently in all the oases of the\r\ncoast of Peru.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: A great fire is a thing almost unknown in Lima. The houses\r\nare of brick, and seldom have any wooden beams, so there is little food\r\nfor a fire. The only fire which I heard of in Lima was that of the 13th\r\nJanuary, 1835, when the interior of the _Capilla del Milagro_ of San\r\nFrancisco was destroyed. The repairs cost 50,000 dollars. On the 27th\r\nNovember, 1838, it was again solemnly consecrated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: The date of this catastrophe recalls the following passage\r\nin Schiller's William Tell:--\r\n\r\n          \"'s ist heut Simons und Judä\r\n    Da ras't der See und will sein Opfer haben.\"\r\n\r\n          \"'Tis the festival of Simon and Jude,\r\n    And the lake rages for its sacrifice.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: RIMAC is the present participle of _rimay_, to speak, to\r\nprattle.

These banditti are chiefly runaway\r\nslaves (simarrones, as they are called), free negroes, zambos, or\r\nmulattos. Occasionally they are joined by Indians, and these latter are\r\nalways conspicuous for the cruelties they perpetrate. Now and then a\r\nwhite man enters upon this lawless course; and, in the year 1839, a\r\nnative of North America, who had been a purser in a ship of war, was\r\nshot in Lima for highway robbery. These robbers are always well mounted,\r\nand their fleet-footed steeds usually enable them to elude pursuit. It\r\nis no unfrequent occurrence for slaves belonging to the plantations to\r\nmount their masters' finest horses, and after sunset, when their work is\r\nover, or on Sundays, when they have nothing to do, to sally forth on\r\nmarauding expeditions.\r\n\r\nMost of the highway robbers who infest the coast of Peru belong to an\r\nextensive and systematically-organized band, headed by formidable\r\nleaders, who maintain spies in the towns and villages, from whom they\r\nreceive regular reports. They sometimes prowl about in parties of thirty\r\nor forty, in the vicinity of the capital, and plunder every traveller\r\nthey encounter; but they are most frequently in smaller detachments. If\r\nthey meet with resistance they give no quarter; therefore, it is most\r\nprudent to submit to be plundered quietly, even when the parties\r\nattacked are stronger than the assailants, for the latter usually have\r\nconfederates at no great distance, and can summon reinforcements in case\r\nof need. Any person who kills a robber in self-defence must ever\r\nafterwards be in fear for his own life: even in Lima the dagger of the\r\nassassin will reach him, and possibly at the moment when he thinks\r\nhimself most safe.\r\n\r\nForeigners are more frequently waylaid than natives. Indeed, the rich\r\nand influential class of Peruvians are seldom subjected to these\r\nattacks,--a circumstance which may serve to explain why more stringent\r\npolice regulations are not adopted.\r\n\r\nThe most unsafe roads are those leading to Callao, Chorillos, and\r\nCavalleros. This last place is on the way to Cerro de Pasco, whither\r\ntransports of money are frequently sent. A few weeks before my departure\r\nfrom Lima a band of thirty robbers, after a short skirmish with a feeble\r\nescort, made themselves masters of a remittance of 100,000 dollars,\r\ndestined for the mine-workers of Pasco. The silver bars from Pasco are\r\nsent to Lima without any military guard, for they are suffered to pass\r\nunmolested, as the robbers find them heavy and cumbrous, and they cannot\r\neasily dispose of them. These depredations are committed close to the\r\ngates of Lima, and after having plundered a number of travellers, the\r\nrobbers will very coolly ride into the city.\r\n\r\nThe country people from the Sierra, who travel with their asses to Lima,\r\nand who carry with them money to make purchases in the capital, are the\r\nconstant prey of robbers, who, if they do not get money, maltreat or\r\nmurder their victims in the most merciless way.[41] In July, 1842, I was\r\nproceeding from the mountains back to Lima, and, passing near the Puente\r\nde Surco, a bridge about a league and a half from Lima, my horse\r\nsuddenly shied at something lying across the road. On alighting I\r\nfound that it was the dead body of an Indian, who had been murdered,\r\ndoubtless, by robbers. The skull was fractured in a shocking manner\r\nby stones. The body was still warm.\r\n\r\nThe zambo robbers are notorious for committing the most heartless\r\ncruelties. In June, 1842, one of them attacked the Indian who was\r\nconveying the mail to Huacho. \"Shall I,\" said the robber, \"kill you or\r\nput out your eyes?\" \"If I must choose,\" replied the Indian, \"pray kill\r\nme at once.\" The barbarian immediately drew forth his dagger and stuck\r\nit into the eyes of the unfortunate victim, and then left him lying on\r\nthe sand. In this state the poor Indian was found by a traveller, who\r\nconveyed him to a neighboring village. The following anecdote was\r\nrelated to me by an Indian, in whose dwelling I passed a night, at\r\nChancay:--About half a league from the village he met a negro, who\r\nadvanced towards him, with musket cocked, and commanded him to halt. My\r\nhost drew out a large riding pistol, and said, \"You may be thankful that\r\nthis is not loaded or you would be a dead man.\" The negro laughing\r\nscornfully, rode up and seized the Indian, when the latter suddenly\r\nfired the pistol, and shot him dead.\r\n\r\nWhen these Peruvian banditti are attacked by the military or the police,\r\nthey defend themselves with desperate courage. If they can effect their\r\nescape they fly for concealment into the woods and thickets, which, if\r\nnot too extensive, are surrounded and set on fire, so that the fugitives\r\nhave no alternative but to surrender, or to perish in the flames.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years, two negroes, named Escobar and Leon, were\r\ndaring leaders of banditti. Leon, who was originally a slave, commenced\r\nhis career of crime by the murder of his master. He eluded the pursuit\r\nof justice, became a highway robber, and for many years was the terror\r\nof the whole province of Lima. The police vainly endeavored to secure\r\nhim. Leon knew the country so well, that he constantly evaded his\r\npursuers. When the price of 2000 dollars was set upon his head, he\r\nboldly entered Lima every evening and slept in the city. At length\r\nplacards were posted about, calling on Leon's comrades to kill him, and\r\noffering to any one who might deliver him up dead into the hands of the\r\npolice the reward of 1000 dollars and a pardon. This measure had the\r\ndesired result, and Leon was strangled, whilst asleep, by a zambo, who\r\nwas his godfather. The body was, during three days, exposed to public\r\nview in front of the cathedral.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated bandit was the zambo, Jose Rayo. He took an active\r\npart in several of the political revolutions; and having, during those\r\ncommotions, been serviceable to the president, he was raised to the rank\r\nof a lieutenant-colonel, and made chief of the country police, called\r\nthe _Partida montada del campo_. This post he still fills, and he is\r\nadmirably well adapted to it, as experience has rendered him thoroughly\r\nacquainted with banditti life, and he knows every hiding-place in the\r\ncountry round Lima. Nevertheless he could not catch the negro Leon, or\r\npossibly he would not seize him, for Leon was his godfather, a\r\nrelationship which is held sacred throughout all classes in Peru. When\r\nRayo speaks of the president and ministers he always styles them _sus\r\nmejores amigos_ (his best friends). I fell in with him once, when\r\ntravelling on the road to Chaclacayo, and rode in company with him as\r\nfar as the Hacienda de Santa Clara. I found him exceedingly complaisant\r\nand courteous in his manners; but his true zambo nature was not wholly\r\nconcealed beneath the smooth surface.\r\n\r\nRobbers, when captured and brought to Lima, undergo a very summary\r\ntrial, and are then sentenced to be shot. The culprits have the\r\nprivilege of choosing their place of execution, and they generally fix\r\non the market-place. They are allowed the assistance of a priest for\r\ntwelve hours prior to their death, and they are conducted from the\r\nchapel to the place of execution, carrying a bench, on which they sit to\r\nundergo the punishment. Four soldiers fire at the distance of three\r\npaces from the culprit; two aiming at his head, and two at his breast.\r\nOn one of these occasions a singular instance of presence of mind and\r\ndexterity occurred a few years ago in Lima. A very daring zambo,\r\nconvicted of highway robbery, was sentenced to death. He made choice of\r\nthe Plaza de la Inquisicion as the scene of his execution. It was market\r\ntime, and the square was crowded with people. The culprit darted around\r\nhim a rapid and penetrating glance, and then composedly seated himself\r\non the bench. The soldiers according to custom levelled their muskets\r\nand fired; but how great was the surprise, when the cloud of smoke\r\ndispersed, and it was discovered that the zambo had vanished. He had\r\nclosely watched the movements of the soldiers, and when they pulled the\r\ntriggers of their muskets, he stooped down, and the balls passed over\r\nhis head. Then suddenly knocking down one of the guards who stood beside\r\nhim, he rushed into the midst of the crowd, where some of his friends\r\nhelped him to effect his escape.\r\n\r\nIn time of war a corps is raised, consisting chiefly of highway robbers\r\nand persons who, by various offences against the laws, have forfeited\r\ntheir freedom or their lives. This corps is called the Montoneros, and\r\nthey are very important auxiliaries when the coast is the theatre of the\r\nwar. The Montoneros, not being trained in military manoeuvres, are not\r\nemployed as regular cavalry, but only as outposts, scouts,\r\ndespatch-bearers, &c. They are good skirmishers, and they harass the\r\nenemy by their unexpected movements; sometimes attacking in front and\r\nsometimes in the rear. They have no regular uniform, and their usual\r\nclothing consists of dirty white trousers and jacket, a poncho, and a\r\nbroad-brimmed straw hat. Many of them are not even provided with shoes,\r\nand their spurs are fastened on their bare heels. Their arms consist\r\nof a short carbine and a sword. When the corps is strong, and is\r\nrequired for active service, it is placed under the command of a\r\nGeneral of the Army. In 1838, General Miller, now British Consul at\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, commanded a corps of 1000 Montoneros, who were\r\nin the service of Santa Cruz. They are held in the strictest\r\ndiscipline by their commanders, who punish theft with death. There is,\r\nhowever, one sort of robbery which they are suffered to commit with\r\nimpunity, viz, horse-stealing. The horses obtained in this way are\r\nused for mounting the cavalry; and detachments of Montoneros are sent\r\nto the plantations to collect horses. They are likewise taken from\r\ntravellers, and from the stables in the capital; but sometimes, after\r\nthe close of the campaign, the animals are returned to their owners.\r\nWhen the war is ended the Montoneros are disbanded, and most of them\r\nreturn to their occupation as highway robbers.\r\n\r\nIn all campaigns the Montoneros are sent forward, by one or two days'\r\nmarch in advance of the main army, either in small or large\r\ndetachments. When they enter a village they experience no difficulty in\r\nobtaining quarters and provisions, for the inhabitants are not disposed\r\nto refuse anything that such visitors may demand. A troop of Montoneros\r\nis a picturesque, but, at the same time, a very fearful sight. Their\r\nblack, yellow, and olive-colored faces, seared by scars, and expressive\r\nof every evil passion and savage feeling; their motley and tattered\r\ngarments; their weary and ill-saddled horses; their short firelocks and\r\nlong swords;--present altogether a most wild and disorderly aspect. The\r\ntraveller, who suddenly encounters such a band, may consider himself\r\nexceedingly lucky if he escapes with only the loss of his horse.\r\n\r\nA universal panic pervades the city of Lima whenever a detachment of\r\nMontoneros enters within the gates. On every side are heard cries of\r\n\"_Cierra puertas!_\" (close the doors!) \"_Los Montoneros!_\" Every person\r\npassing along the streets runs into the first house he comes to, and\r\ncloses the door after him. In a few moments the streets are cleared, and\r\nno sound is heard but the galloping of the Montoneros' horses.\r\n\r\nWithin the distance of a few leagues from Lima there are several pretty\r\nvillages, to which the wealthier class of the inhabitants of the capital\r\nresort in the summer seasons, for sea-bathing. The nearest, situated\r\nabout three-quarters of a league from Lima, is Magdalena, where the\r\nViceroy of Peru formerly had a beautiful summer residence. Miraflores,\r\nabout midway between Lima and Chorillos, is a small village containing a\r\nplaza and some neatly-built houses. Though the heat is greater here than\r\nin the capital, yet the air is purer, and Miraflores may be regarded as\r\nthe healthiest spot in the neighborhood of Lima. The sultry atmosphere\r\nis refreshed by the sea breezes. Surrounded by verdant though not\r\nluxuriant vegetation, and sufficiently distant from the marshes,\r\nMiraflores appears to combine within itself all that can be wished for\r\nin a summer residence. For asthmatic patients the air is particularly\r\nfavorable. An old Spaniard of my acquaintance, who was engaged during\r\nthe day in business in Lima, used to go every night to sleep at\r\nMiraflores: he assured me that if he slept a night in the capital he\r\nsuffered a severe attack of asthma.\r\n\r\nChorillos is a poor, ill-looking village. The streets are dirty and\r\ncrooked, and the houses are mere ranchos. It is built close to the sea,\r\non a steep sandy beach; but, though anything but a pleasant place,\r\nChorillos is the favorite resort of the wealthy Limayan families. Not a\r\ntree is visible in the neighborhood of the village, and the unshaded\r\nrays of the sun are reflected with twofold power from the hot sand. A\r\nbroad, steep road leads down to the bathing-place on the sea-beach,\r\nwhich is rough and shingly. A row of small huts, covered with matting,\r\nserve as dressing-rooms. Both ladies and gentlemen use bathing dresses,\r\nwhich are very neatly made of a kind of blue cloth. The ladies are\r\naccompanied by guides (_bañaderos_). These are Indians, who dwell in the\r\nvillage. In winter they employ themselves in fishing, and in summer they\r\nlive by what they get from the visitors who resort to Chorillos. They\r\nare a good-looking, hardy race of people.\r\n\r\nThe time for bathing is early in the morning. The interval between\r\nbreakfast and dinner is devoted to swinging in the hammock, either in\r\nthe sala or in the corridor. The afternoon and evening are spent on the\r\npromenade, and the later hours of the night at the gaming-table. The\r\nroutine of the day's occupations and amusements is much the same as in\r\nmost of the watering-places of Europe, excepting that, in the latter,\r\nthe hammock is suspended by the chair in the reading-room and\r\ncoffee-house, or the bench on the promenade. The sultry nights in\r\nChorillos are rendered doubly unpleasant by the swarms of vermin which\r\ninfest the houses. Fleas, bugs, mosquitoes and sancudos, combine to\r\nbanish rest from the couch of even the soundest sleeper.\r\n\r\nSurco is situated about half a league from Chorillos, and further into\r\nthe interior of the country. It is a poor but pleasant village,\r\nsurrounded by tropical trees and luxuriant vegetation. The climate is\r\nnot so hot as that of Lima or Chorillos. Surco is a very pretty spot,\r\nthough seldom resorted to by the inhabitants of the capital; because it\r\nboasts neither baths nor gaming-tables.\r\n\r\nTwo leagues eastward of Lima, in the direction of the mountains, is\r\nthe village El Ate. It lies in a fertile valley, and enjoys a pure\r\nand equal temperature. It is much resorted to by invalids suffering\r\nfrom pulmonary disorders, which, if not cured, are at least relieved\r\nby the pure air.\r\n\r\nLurin is situated five leagues south from the capital, and a quarter of\r\na league from the Rio de Lurin, which intersects the Quebrada of\r\nHuarochirin. Fine gardens, and well-cultivated lands, impart beauty to\r\nthe surrounding scenery. At Michaelmas Lurin is visited by many of the\r\ninhabitants of the capital, St. Michael being the patron saint of the\r\nplace. The village stands about a thousand paces from the margin of the\r\nsea-shore, which is two miles distant from the rocky islands of\r\nTarallones, Santo Domingo, and Pacchacamac. Prior to the Spanish\r\nconquest, the valley of Lurin was one of the most populous parts of the\r\ncoast of Peru. The whole of the broad valley was then called\r\nPacchacamac, because near the sea-shore and northward of the river,\r\nthere was a temple sacred to the \"Creator of the Earth.\"[42] Pacchacamac\r\nwas the greatest deity of the Yuncas, who did not worship the sun until\r\nafter their subjugation by the Incas. The temple of Pacchacamac was then\r\ndedicated to the sun by the Incas, who destroyed the idols which the\r\nYuncas had worshipped, and appointed to the service of the temple a\r\ncertain number of virgins of royal descent. In the year 1534, Pizarro\r\ninvaded the village of Lurin: his troops destroyed the temple, and the\r\nVirgins of the Sun were dishonored and murdered.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the temple of Pacchacamac are among the most interesting\r\nobjects on the coast of Peru. They are situated on a hill about 558\r\nfeet high. The summit of the hill is overlaid with a solid mass of\r\nbrick-work about thirty feet in height. On this artificial ridge stood\r\nthe temple, enclosed by high walls, rising in the form of an\r\namphitheatre. It is now a mass of ruins; all that remains of it being\r\nsome niches, the walls of which present faint traces of red and yellow\r\npainting. At the foot, and on the sides of the hill, are scattered\r\nruins which were formerly the walls of habitations. The whole was\r\nencircled by a wall eight feet in breadth, and it was probably of\r\nconsiderable height, for some of the parts now standing are twelve\r\nfeet high, though the average height does not exceed three or four\r\nfeet. The mania of digging for treasures every year makes\r\nencroachments on these vestiges of a bygone age, whose monuments\r\nare well deserving of more careful preservation.\r\n\r\nTravelling on the coast of Peru is difficult and tedious. The roads\r\nlead through plains of sand, where often not a trace of vegetation is\r\nto be seen, nor a drop of water to be found for twenty or thirty\r\nmiles. It is found desirable to take all possible advantage of the\r\nnight, in order to escape the scorching rays of a tropical sun; but\r\nwhen there is no moonlight, and above all, when clouds of mist obscure\r\nthe directing stars, the traveller runs the risk of getting out of his\r\ncourse, and at daybreak, discovering his error, he may have to retrace\r\nhis weary way. This extra fatigue may possibly disable his horse, so\r\nthat the animal cannot proceed further. In such an emergency a\r\ntraveller finds his life in jeopardy; for should he attempt to go\r\nforward on foot he may, in all probability, fall a sacrifice to\r\nfatigue and thirst. Numbers of beasts of burden sink every year under\r\nthe difficulties of such a journey; and their bones serve to mark the\r\ndirection of the road. Long journeys over these sand plains should be\r\nundertaken only with good and well-tried horses. For the most part the\r\nhorses cannot stand hunger and thirst forty-eight hours without\r\nbecoming so exhausted that the rider has the greatest difficulty in\r\nmaking them drag on; and if he is inconsiderate enough to force the\r\nanimal to take a quicker pace, the horse lies down and dies. The mule,\r\nwhich more easily supports the difficulties of a severe journey on the\r\nsparest food, is, in Peru, the camel of the desert. Without mules, a\r\nlong journey on most parts of the coast would be impracticable. The\r\nhorse obeys the spur until he falls dead under the rider. Not so the\r\nmule: when too weary to journey onward he stands stock still, and\r\nneither whip nor spur will move him until he has rested. After that he\r\nwill willingly proceed on his way. By this means the traveller has a\r\ncriterion by which he can judge of the powers of his animal.\r\n\r\nExcursions along the coast have been greatly facilitated by the\r\nintroduction of steam navigation, and travellers now eagerly avail\r\nthemselves of that rapid and secure mode of conveyance. Even in sailing\r\nvessels voyages from south to north can be conveniently performed in\r\nconsequence of the regularity of the tradewind.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence in Lima, in the commencement of the year 1841, I\r\nvisited the port of Huacho, situated to the north. A packet bound to\r\nPanama had permission to touch at Huacho, without casting anchor, as she\r\nhad to convey political prisoners under sentence of transportation to\r\nPanama. I was one of five passengers who landed at Huacho, and among the\r\nnumber was the pastor of the town, that very original individual, \"the\r\nCura Requena.\" The passage, which is usually made in fourteen hours,\r\nlasted two days and a half. Off the port we fell in with a Peruvian\r\nsloop of war, which, on our sailing from Callao, had been sent to watch\r\nus, and to stop the prisoners in case they attempted to escape. Our\r\ncaptain lay to, and we stepped into a boat. Our movements were\r\nobserved from the shore, where, for some days, a report had prevailed\r\nthat Santa Cruz was coming with Corsairs, to make a descent. The\r\ninhabitants believed that our ship must belong to that expedition.\r\nThey were the more confirmed in their notion, inasmuch as the\r\nappearance of a sloop of war, which had sailed about for some hours in\r\nthe bay, could not otherwise be explained. Accordingly the alarm bell\r\nwas rung. The custom-house officers and the coast guards, headed by\r\nthe port captain, and followed by a crowd of people, came down to the\r\nshore, some armed with muskets and pistols, others with swords and\r\ncudgels, to repel the intended attack.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the port of Huacho the breakers are so dangerous that\r\nan ordinary-sized boat cannot put in. Landing is therefore effected in\r\nthe small canoes of the Indians. When we approached the shore we made\r\nsignals, and called loudly for canoes, but in vain. The dismayed\r\nHuachanos showed no inclination to assist their supposed enemies. Our\r\ncaptain, who was with us in the boat, said, that as a fresh wind from\r\nthe shore was springing up he could wait no longer, and that he must\r\ntake us with him to Panama. This very unpleasant piece of information\r\nprompted us to put into execution a plan which was suggested by despair.\r\nThe tall, lank pastor, wrapped in the black ecclesiastical robe, called\r\nthe _talar_, was placed at the prow, where he stood up, making signs of\r\npeace and friendship to the natives. This had the desired effect. The\r\nport captain had a good glass, with which he quickly recognized the\r\nmarked features of the Cura, and several Indian boats were instantly\r\ndespatched to convey us on shore. These Indian canoes consist of long\r\nnarrow stumps of trees, hollowed longitudinally. On either side is\r\nnailed a _palo de balzas_, viz., a beam of a very porous kind of wood.\r\nOne Indian sits forward, another more backward, each having a short\r\nwooden shovel-shaped oar, with which they strike the water right and\r\nleft, and thus scull the boat onward. The passengers must crouch or\r\nkneel down in the middle, and dare not stir, for the least irregularity\r\nin the motion would upset the boat. We landed safely, and amused\r\nourselves by referring to the mistake of the brave guardians of the\r\ncoast. Horses were provided for us, and we rode to the town, which is\r\nsituated at about half a league up the gently-rising coast.\r\n\r\nMy principal occupation, during a six weeks' residence on this part of\r\nthe coast, which is very rich in fishes, was to augment my\r\nichthyological collection, and to make myself well acquainted with the\r\nenvirons of Huacho. Every morning, at five o'clock, I rode down to the\r\nshore, and waited on the strand to see the boats returning with what had\r\nbeen caught, during the night, by the fishers, who readily descried me\r\nat a distance, and held up, in their boat, such strange inhabitants of\r\nthe deep as had come into their possession. I succeeded in making out,\r\nfrom several hundred individual specimens, one hundred and twenty\r\ndistinct species of sea and river fish. But an unlucky fate hovered over\r\nthis fine collection. The fishes were all put into a cask with brandy,\r\nwhich, by neglect of the commissary of the port, was left on the Mole at\r\nCallao, for several months, in the burning heat of the sun: in\r\nconsequence its contents were utterly destroyed. A second collection was\r\nprepared, and immediately shipped for Europe, and in the packing the\r\ngreatest care was observed. Nevertheless it arrived, after a voyage of\r\nfifteen months, in a state quite useless. Thus the fruits of much labor\r\nand a considerable expense were entirely lost.\r\n\r\nHuacho is a little village, which, since the war of Independence, has\r\nreceived the title of \"city.\" It has more than 5000 inhabitants, of\r\nwhom four-fifths are Indians and the rest mestizes. Very few whites\r\nhave settled here. Among them I met an old lame Spaniard, \"Don Simon,\"\r\nwho, at the beginning of the present century, accompanied the\r\ncelebrated Alexander von Humboldt to the beds of salt situated a few\r\nmiles to the south. In relating, with enthusiastic pleasure, his\r\nrecollections of the youthful and indefatigable traveller, he told me\r\nthat, some years ago, he had read through the book which Humboldt\r\nwrote on America, and he added, with great simplicity, \"_pero, Señor,\r\nahi he perdido los estribos_.\"[43]\r\n\r\nThe natives employ themselves in fishing, agriculture, and the\r\nbreeding of poultry. Most of the poultry brought to market in Lima\r\ncomes from Huacho. Every Friday large caravan-like processions of\r\nIndian women repair to the capital with fowls, ducks, and turkeys.\r\nFifteen or twenty are tied together by the feet, and make a sort of\r\nbunch; and two of such bunches are hung at the pommel of the saddle,\r\nso that one hangs down on either side of the horse. The chola[44] sits\r\nin the middle. Under this burthen the poor animal has to travel two\r\ndays and a half. Only when the caravan halts does he enjoy the relief\r\nof being unsaddled and fed. Some of the Indians of Huacho work in the\r\nsalt-pits. The women plait coarse straw hats, and a kind of mats\r\ncalled _petates_, which they carry to Lima for sale.\r\n\r\nThe Huachanos cannot be ranked among the best classes of the Indians.\r\nThey are malicious, revengeful, and knavish. Their character has\r\nevidently deteriorated amidst the numerous revolutions which preceded\r\nthe establishment of the Republic, and the frequent passage of troops\r\nthrough the town. The Padre Requena sketched to me a terrible picture\r\nof his _Indios brutos_; but truly, under the guidance of such a\r\nshepherd, it were unreasonable to expect the flock to be very good.\r\nThis venerable Cura was a fair type of the Peruvian priesthood. He was\r\npassionately fond of hunting, and for the enjoyment of that recreation\r\nhe kept a number of excellent horses, and several packs of hounds,\r\nparticularly _galgos_ (greyhounds), for some of which he paid 150 or\r\n200 dollars. In the most shameless way he violated the ecclesiastical\r\nvow of celibacy, and he was usually surrounded by several of his own\r\nchildren, who called him _uncle_, addressing him by the appellation of\r\n_tio_, the term usually employed in Peru to express that sort of\r\nrelationship. The Padre used to boast of his alleged friendship with\r\nLord Cochrane, in which he affected to pride himself very greatly. He\r\ndied in a few weeks after his return to Huacho. He refused so long to\r\nmake his confession, that the Indians, uttering furious menaces,\r\nassembled in crowds about his house. Some even compelled a priest to go\r\nin to him, to represent the awful consequences of his obstinacy. On the\r\napproach of death, he declared that the thought which most occupied him\r\nwas his separation from his hounds, and when his hands were becoming\r\ncold he called to his negro to fetch a pair of buckskin hunting gloves,\r\nand desired to have them drawn on.\r\n\r\nIn Peru the clergy have no fixed stipend. Their emoluments are derived\r\nfrom the fees and perquisites which their ecclesiastical functions bring\r\nin. For baptisms, marriages, and masses, fixed sums are established; but\r\nit is not so with burials, for which the priest receives a present\r\nproportional to the circumstances of the deceased. The interment of a\r\npoor person (_entierro baxo_) costs at least from eight to ten dollars,\r\nwhich sum is extorted from the survivors with the most unrelenting\r\nrigor. For the burial of a rich person (_entierro alto_) the sum of two\r\nhundred dollars is frequently paid. If a wealthy man should express in\r\nhis will his desire for an _entierro baxo_, the priest sets this clause\r\naside, and proceeds with the costly ceremonies, the payment for which is\r\ninsured by the pious feelings of the family. Hence some of the richer\r\n_comunerias_, of which Huacho is one, yield to the priest annually from\r\n12,000 to 14,000 dollars. When a priest dies, the clergy of the\r\nneighboring villages meet and bury him with great pomp, free of any\r\npayment except a good banquet.\r\n\r\nA rich Indian of Huacho made a bargain with his countrymen that, on\r\ntheir paying him weekly a medio (the sixteenth part of a dollar), he\r\nwould defray the expenses of their funerals. By this agreement he\r\nrealized a considerable sum of money. The Cholos made it a condition\r\nthat they should be buried in coffins, which is not common with the\r\nlower classes in Peru. The Indian complied with this condition. When a\r\nCholo died, a coffin was sent to his residence. If too short, the corpse\r\nwas bent and forced into it. The interment then took place according to\r\nthe ritual of the Church. On the following night the Indian who had\r\ncontracted for the burials repaired with a confidential servant to the\r\nchurchyard, dug up the coffin, threw the body back into the grave, and\r\ncarried off the coffin, with the _mortaja_ (the funeral garment), which\r\nserved for the next customer. The contractor made each coffin last as\r\nlong as the boards would hold together. This system, at all events,\r\nsecured the Cholos against the danger of being buried alive.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard of Huacho presents a revolting spectacle. A low wall\r\nsurrounds a space of sandy ground, which is strewed with skulls, bones,\r\nfragments of burial clothes, and mutilated human bodies. The coffin\r\nplunderer, on replacing the corpse in the grave, merely throws some\r\nloose sand over it, and the consequence is that the remains of the dead\r\nfrequently become the prey of dogs, foxes, and other carrion feeders.\r\nWhen the family of a deceased person can contribute nothing to defray\r\nthe funeral expenses, the body is conveyed privately during the night to\r\nthe churchyard. In the morning it is found half consumed.\r\n\r\nThe environs of Huacho abound in fine fruit gardens, and productive\r\nIndian farms. The climate is healthful, though very hot. The vicinity of\r\nthe sea and the convenience of good bathing would render it an agreeable\r\nplace of residence, were it not infested with vermin. Fleas propagate in\r\nthe sand in almost incredible multitudes, especially in the neighborhood\r\nof the Indian huts, and any person entering them is in a moment covered\r\nwith hundreds of those tormentors. Bugs, too, swarm in the lime walls;\r\nthough that description of vermin is less numerous in Huacho than in\r\nsome of the more northern towns.\r\n\r\nIn a fine valley, about two short leagues from Huacho, the little town\r\nof Huaura is situated on the bank of a river of the same name. This Rio\r\nde Huaura is formed by the union of two rivers. The larger of the two\r\nrises in the Cordillera de Paria, and flows through the wild ravine of\r\nChuichin: the smaller river, called the Rio Chico de Sayan, rises from a\r\nlake of considerable size in the Altos de Huaquimarci. Both unite below\r\nthe village of Sayan. In the vicinity of Huaura the river forms several\r\nmarshes, in which malaria is generated. In very few places have I seen\r\nthe stratum of malaria so distinctly separated from the atmosphere as\r\nhere. It lies at an average about two, or two and a half feet above the\r\nmarsh, and is carried over it by strong atmospheric currents. It is\r\ndistinguished by a peculiar kind of opalization, and on certain\r\nchanges of light it exhibits a yellowish tint. This is particularly\r\nperceptible in the morning, on coming down from the high grounds. The\r\nmarshy plain then appears overhung with a thick color-changing sheet\r\nof malaria. Malignant intermittent fever and diseases of the skin are\r\nfrequent in Huaura. The town is thinly peopled; the number of\r\ninhabitants being not more than 2000.\r\n\r\nA great sugar plantation, called El Ingenio, is situated at about a\r\nquarter of a league from Huaura. It formerly belonged to the Jesuits,\r\nbut is now the property of a rich Lima family. The _trapiche_, or\r\nsugar-mill, is worked by a water-wheel, the first ever established in\r\nPeru, a circumstance of which the owner proudly boasts.\r\n\r\nThe valley which opens here is magnificent, and to ride through it\r\neasterly eleven leagues towards Sayan is one of the finest excursions\r\nwhich can be made in Peru. Over this beautiful district are scattered\r\nmany rich plantations. The one next in importance to El Ingenio is\r\nAcaray, which, though not very large, is most carefully cultivated:\r\nanother, called Huillcahuaura, has a splendid building erected on it. In\r\nthe middle of the valley is the extensive sugar plantation of Luhmayo.\r\nNear this place I saw, in a negro's hut, an ounce of immense size, which\r\nhad been killed a few weeks previously. More than fifty Negroes and\r\nIndians had been engaged in subduing this ferocious animal, which was\r\nnot killed until after a conflict of two days, in the course of which\r\nseveral negroes were dangerously wounded. This gigantic specimen\r\nmeasured, from the snout to the tip of the tail, eight feet three\r\ninches; the tail itself measuring two feet eight inches.\r\n\r\nAt the sugar works of Luhmayo, notwithstanding the number of pipes, and\r\nother methods of supplying water, the cylinders are always worked by\r\noxen, and are kept in motion day and night. I took a view of the works\r\nduring the night, and the extraordinary picture I beheld will never be\r\neffaced from my memory. In the middle of the spacious building\r\nappropriated to the operations blazed a large fire, fed by the refuse\r\nof sugar canes. Around lay negroes, some asleep, and others muttering\r\nto each other in an under-tone. Here and there sat one perfectly\r\nsilent, wrapped in his own reflections, and apparently brooding over\r\nsome gloomy plan. The oxen paced slowly round the pole, which directed\r\nthe movement of the cylinders; the animals alternately disappearing in\r\nthe obscure background, and returning to the point where the glare of\r\nthe fire, falling full upon them, lighted them up as if by the sudden\r\neffect of magic. Behind them stalked a tall black figure, driving them\r\non with a rod made of brambles. Groups of children were busily\r\nemployed in thrusting the full sugar canes between the cylinders; and\r\nafter they were pressed, collecting together the sapless reeds, and\r\npiling them up in regular heaps.\r\n\r\nNext morning the person who officiated as medical superintendant of the\r\nplantation, showed me all the arrangements of the establishment. He gave\r\nme an account of his cures and operations, and told me that he often\r\nfound it necessary to amputate, because the slaves purposely injure\r\ntheir fingers and arms in the _Phalangeles_ (machines) in order to\r\ndisable themselves. The worthy Æsculapius had never in his life read a\r\nregular medical work. He had originally been an overseer of slaves,\r\nand had afterwards turned doctor. He informed me that some time before\r\nI saw him, ninety negroes, his patients, had died of small-pox in the\r\nspace of nine months, whereby the owner of the plantation had lost\r\n45,000 dollars. The hospital was clean and well fitted up, but\r\nover-crowded with sick. Most of them died from intermitting fever, and\r\nfrom dropsy and rheumatism which followed it. Not a few of the male\r\nnegroes suffer from a peculiar kind of cutaneous disease, which shows\r\nitself by large pustules on the arms and breast. After suppuration\r\nthey dry and fall off, but leave indelible spots, which, on a black\r\nskin, are of a whitish color; on a brown skin, olive-green, and on a\r\nwhite skin, black. I never saw the disease in any other part of the\r\ncountry except in this valley. Negroes and persons of mixed blood are\r\nmore subject to it than the whites.\r\n\r\nThe two plantations on the east side of the valley are Chambara and\r\nQuipico. The latter is celebrated for the fine sugar it produces, and is\r\nalso well known on account of the original character of its late\r\nproprietor, Castilla. When I rode into the court, I was in a moment\r\nsurrounded by about fifty fine greyhounds, and from every side others\r\ncame springing forward. This was but a remnant of Castilla's collection.\r\nHe was passionately devoted to hunting, and generally kept from 200 to\r\n300 greyhounds, with which he rode out daily. A bell was rung at certain\r\nhours to collect the light-footed tribe to their meals. A gallows was\r\nerected in the court, where the intractable underwent capital punishment\r\nas a warning to the rest. One day when Castilla went out to hunt, he was\r\njoined in the chase by an Indian, who brought with him a common mongrel.\r\nThis animal outstripped some of the greyhounds in speed, and quickly\r\novertook the deer. Castilla immediately bought the dog, for which he\r\ngave the immense price of 350 dollars. A few days after he rode out to\r\nhunt with his best greyhounds, together with the newly-purchased dog.\r\nThe pack being let loose, all the dogs set off in full chase, but the\r\nmongrel remained quietly beside the horses. On returning to the\r\nplantation, he was hung up on the gallows as a warning example.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Huacho, the _Pampa del medio mundo_, a sand plain, seven\r\nleagues long, stretches out to the village of Supe. At short successive\r\ndistances farther to the north are the villages of _Baranca_,\r\n_Pativilca_ (or rather Pati Huillca), and _la Fortaleza_. Then there\r\nintervenes a vast waste, which extends nearly to Huarmay. Between that\r\nvillage and the Port of Casma there is a similar long plain of sand.\r\nThus do wastes, and fruitful valleys, alternate along the whole coast\r\nuntil near Tumbez, on the frontiers of the Republic of the Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThe whole district is rich in memorable monuments of the time of the\r\nIncas. The most important are the remains of the palace of King Chimu\r\nCancha, not far from the harbor of Huanchaco, and the ruins of\r\nParamanca, near la Fortaleza. Doctor Unanue[45] is of opinion that the\r\nlatter edifice was built to commemorate the peace between King Chimu\r\nCancha and his conqueror, Capac Yupanqui; and that of two other\r\nbuildings, one (the larger), situated towards the east, marks the\r\ndominions of the powerful Inca Pachacutec, and the other (the smaller),\r\ntowards the west, indicates the territory of the conquered Chimu. This\r\nsupposition is, in my opinion, quite erroneous. Independently of the\r\nplainly-recognizable character of those ruins, the construction of which\r\nshows them to have been fortifications, their situation bears evidence\r\nagainst the inference of Unanue. Supposing the larger building to have\r\nindicated the position of the Inca Empire, it ought to have been\r\nsituated to the south, and the smaller building would have been to the\r\nnorth. The only passable road along the coast led between these two\r\nfortified hills; and by them the road on that side to the Kingdom of\r\nChimu could be cut off. The Incas well knew, from experience, that the\r\nsubdued populations, usually after a longer or a shorter time, again\r\nrevolted, and endeavored to shake off their yoke, and therefore they\r\nwere on their guard against such an occurrence. Capac Yupanqui must\r\nhave greatly mistrusted an enemy so formidable as Chimu Cancha, who\r\nhad only yielded after the most obstinate resistance, and it is no\r\nslight proof of this that Paramanca[46] was built as a fortress to\r\nhold the subjugated nations in check. It was not, however, built as a\r\nmonument of victory, for such monuments were always erected in Cozco,\r\nthe capital, and never on the field of battle. Etymology affords no\r\nsolution of this question. Some write Paramonga, others Paramanca. I\r\nregard the latter as the most correct. Garcilaso de la Vega calls the\r\nvalley Parmunca. In the Quichua dialect _Paramanca_[47] signifies a\r\npot for rain. It is therefore possible that the name may indicate an\r\nallusion to heavy torrents of rain, which, though now unusual on this\r\nparticular part of the coast, may have occurred in this basin-like\r\nvalley after a great earthquake.\r\n\r\nFive leagues to the south of Huacho are the extensive _Salinas_, or salt\r\npits, which supply Peru and Chile with excellent salt. They spread from\r\nthe sea coast to the distance of half a league eastward, and present a\r\nmost extraordinary aspect. On approaching them the traveller might fancy\r\nhe beholds a field of glaciers, on which the sun's rays produce\r\nwonderful effects of variegated color.\r\n\r\nThis salt is the produce of a natural evaporation of the sea water,\r\nwhich trickles through the porous stones of the coast, and fills every\r\nintervening hollow. The whole space is parcelled into divisions, called\r\nfields, from which, according to a definite regulation, square masses,\r\nweighing each one hundred pounds, are cut. In a few days the holes are\r\nagain filled up with sea water, which, in the space of twelve to\r\nsixteen, or sometimes twenty to twenty-four months, being evaporated by\r\nthe sun, leaves a precipitate completely filling up the square holes.\r\nThe government has farmed the salinas to a private individual in Huacho,\r\nwho keeps on the spot an overseer with the necessary number of\r\nlaborers. This establishment is an inexhaustible source of wealth, and\r\nit can only be destroyed by a violent earthquake. In the bay on which\r\nthe salinas border there is very convenient and secure anchoring\r\nground, where coasters are constantly lying, ready to receive the\r\nsalt, and convey it to any Peruvian or Chilean port. Most of the\r\nlaborers employed in the salinas suffer from diseases of the skin and\r\nrheumatism. Water and provisions have to be brought from Huacho. The\r\nIndians, when they come from the mountains to convey salt, never take\r\ntheir llamas to the salinas. They go straight to Huacho, where the\r\nanimals are loaded at the great depôts. Each llama carries the weight\r\nof one hundred pounds, which, however, is not, like ordinary burthens,\r\nlaid on the bare back of the animal--beneath it is placed a layer of\r\nthick woollen cloth, called a _jerga_.\r\n\r\nThe road southward from the Salinas runs, for the distance of nine\r\nleagues, through deep sand, chiefly along the sea-coast, and is bounded\r\non the east by the _Lomas de Lachay_. Here flocks of strand snipes and\r\nflamingoes fly constantly before the traveller, as if to direct his\r\ncourse. In the _pescadores_ (fishermen's huts), five leagues from the\r\nSalinas, brackish water and broiled fish may be obtained, and sometimes\r\neven clover, which is brought hither, from the distance of several\r\nmiles, to feed the hungry horses. From the pescadores the road crosses\r\nsteep sand-hills, which rise from three to four hundred feet high, and\r\nfall with a declivity of more than sixty degrees towards the sea. The\r\nroad leads along the side of these hills, and, where the ground is not\r\nfirm, it is exceedingly dangerous. On a false step of the horse the\r\nground yields beneath his hoof, and rolls down the declivity; but by due\r\ncare the rider can easily recover a solid footing. There is on one of\r\nthese hills a very large stone, which at a certain distance presents in\r\ncolor and form a deceptious similarity to an enormous-sized seal. Almost\r\nperpendicularly under it is a small bay, inhabited by a multitude of\r\nseals. The dull crashing sound made by the breakers on the shore,\r\nmingling with the howling of these animals, makes a gloomy impression on\r\nthe traveller who is passing along the height above them, and creates a\r\nsort of shuddering sensation. The natives call this place and its sounds\r\nthe _Grita Lobos_ (the Sea-dog's Howl). From this hilly ground the road\r\ndescends into the fruitful valley of the _Pasamayo_, which contains two\r\nvillages and eighteen plantations.\r\n\r\nChancay, the principal town in this valley, is the residence of a\r\nsub-prefect. It is a league and a half from the river, and a short\r\nleague from the sea, where there is an inconsiderable and not very safe\r\nport, which can only be entered by small vessels. The number of\r\ninhabitants is about 1200, chiefly Indians and Mulattos. Excellent\r\nfruits and vegetables, good beef, mutton, and poultry, and well-flavored\r\nfish, are found here in abundance. The houses are all of the poorest\r\nstructure, and are sparingly and rudely furnished. In the neighboring\r\nfarms, some of which are large, as Torreblanco, Pasamayo, &c., maize is\r\nextensively cultivated for exportation and for food to the swine, which\r\nare very numerous. In no other valley of Peru are there so many\r\nearth-fleas, or _piques_, as they are called, particularly about the\r\nplantations. The _pique_ is a small, white insect, which lives in sand,\r\nbut fastens as a parasite on man and beast, more particularly on swine.\r\nIt attacks man by penetrating the skin, for the most part under the\r\ntoe-nails, where an egg is laid, from which a painful tumor is\r\nafterwards formed. Should this be neglected, the brood is developed, and\r\npenetrates further into the flesh. Then follow violent inflammations and\r\nimposthumes, which sometimes assume so serious a character that the\r\namputation of the foot becomes necessary. While the _pique_ is\r\npenetrating there is no sensation of its presence; it is first felt on\r\nthe development of the egg, and then it is still easy to remove the\r\nbag which contains it, and the mother with it. The Negresses\r\naccomplish this with great dexterity. They make an aperture in the\r\nskin by scratching it with a needle, and then they draw the bag out.\r\nShould it burst, they take out the egg with the needle; but this is a\r\nvery delicate operation. I have always been able to do it more\r\nspeedily and more securely with the lancet. The hole is commonly of\r\nthe size of a bean, and hot cigar ashes are put into it to destroy any\r\neggs or larvæ which may remain. These insects do not always confine\r\nthemselves to the feet; they sometimes attack the body and the face,\r\nand it is in general extremely difficult for the patient to discover\r\nhow or where he became acquainted with such troublesome companions. I\r\nonce had six tumors, caused by broods of _piques_, on my right foot,\r\nand I could not trace the annoyance to any other cause than having\r\nstopped for a few minutes, while my horse was being saddled, in the\r\n_corral_, or yard, of a plantation.\r\n\r\nThe road from Chancay to the Haciendas of Bisquira, Andahuasi, and the\r\nvillage of Sayan, extends in a northeasterly direction, through a dreary\r\nvalley of sand, between rows of sterile hillocks of the most singular\r\nforms. I had once to travel along twelve leagues of this wearisome road,\r\nunder the most oppressive heat of the sun. The mules were quite\r\novercome, and when we reached the _Cuesta de los ahorcados_ (the hill of\r\nthe hanged) they would not move another step. We had to descend and give\r\nthem a long rest. We stretched ourselves under the bellies of the\r\nanimals, the only shade we could get in this treeless waste. At last,\r\nafter a very difficult journey, during which we lost ourselves in a\r\nmarsh in the neighborhood of Bisquira, we arrived about midnight at\r\nAndahuasi. On this road, only two leagues from Chancay, near the\r\nHacienda of Chancayllo, are situated the Colcas, most remarkable\r\nsubterraneous structures, of the time of the Incas. According to\r\ntradition, they were built by the Yuncas, during the campaign of Capac\r\nYupanqui against Chimu Cancha, as provision magazines for the numerous\r\narmy, more than 120,000 strong.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Pasamayo, on the north bank, there are some salinas,\r\nwhich, however, are far more inconsiderable than those of Huacho.\r\n\r\nThe first time I went from Huacho to Lima, I wished to pass over the\r\nwhole road, twenty-eight leagues, in one uninterrupted ride; accordingly\r\nI left Huacho at two o'clock, P. M., in order that I might cross the\r\ngreat sand-flats during the night. A negro who knew the road accompanied\r\nme. We passed through Chancay at midnight. Some muleteers, lying before\r\na hut, called to us, and warned us to stop, as the river had swelled\r\nvery much. Nevertheless we proceeded onward, and by one o'clock we\r\nreached the Pasamayo, which, in consequence of the heavy rains from the\r\nmountains, had overflowed its banks. Several travellers had stretched\r\nthemselves on the ground to wait for the morning light, and in the hope\r\nthat the flood would by that time subside. No Chimbadores[48] were to be\r\nhad. My negro guide looked at the water with dismay, and declared that\r\nhe had never before witnessed so furious a swell. However, we had no\r\ntime to lose, and I resolved to attempt the passage of the river.\r\nTrusting to my well tried horse, which had already carried me safely\r\nthrough many difficult coasting journeys, I cautiously rode into the\r\nriver, which became deeper at every step. The overwhelming force of the\r\nstream was felt by my horse; and he presently lost his footing, though\r\nhe still continued to struggle vigorously against the force of the\r\ncurrent. At this juncture, some passing clouds obscured the moon, and I\r\nlost sight of a group of trees which, before leaving the opposite bank,\r\nI fixed my eye upon as a guiding beacon. Quite powerless, my horse\r\nand I were carried away by the stream, and driven against a rock in\r\nthe middle of the river. I now heard the anxious outcries of my negro\r\nand the travellers on the bank, whilst the waves rose over my head.\r\nWith a convulsive effort I pulled the bridle, and the horse then\r\nturning completely round, once more gained his solid footing. I then\r\ngave him the spur, and the courageous animal dashing again into the\r\nmidst of the current, swam with me to the bank. I rode forward with my\r\nnegro in search of a better fording-place, and after several fruitless\r\nattempts, we at length found one, and we crossed the river safely. The\r\nother travellers did not venture to follow our example, but called out\r\nbegging us not to leave them behind. I sent the negro back on my horse\r\nto bring them over; and the noble animal went backward and forward no\r\nless than seven times without making one false step. After all this\r\nexertion, he bore me with unflagging spirit into Lima, where we\r\narrived at noon on the following day.\r\n\r\nFrom the Pasamayo, the road runs for the space of two leagues\r\ntolerably level, and for the most part amidst plantations. Then\r\nsucceed steep sandy hills, for the distance of about four leagues.\r\nThe roads are very wearisome both to horse and rider, especially in\r\nthe declivities towards the plains, where the horse is frequently\r\nover his knees in sand. In those parts there are also some\r\nextraordinary atmospheric mirrors, in which we beheld ourselves in\r\nreflection, riding over our own heads, and our figures magnified to\r\ngigantic proportions. Six leagues from Chancay, there are two wretched\r\nhuts, forming the tambo, or inn, in which travellers obtain\r\nrefreshment. From thence the road runs through a stony tract,\r\npartially strewn with large masses of rock, called the _Piedras\r\ngordas_, and leading to the marshes which surround the Copacahuana\r\nplantations. Two leagues further on is the river Chillon, which, like\r\nthe Pasamayo, may generally be easily forded, but which swells\r\nfuriously during heavy falls of rain. At a short distance behind the\r\nriver, the road, called the Camino de Valles, joins that leading to\r\nCerro de Pasco. About a league from Lima there is a place called _Palo\r\nseco_, which, like _Piedras gordas_, is a celebrated haunt of robbers.\r\nThe traveller has reason to congratulate himself if he passes these\r\ntwo places without an attack.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The Indians resort to very artful methods of hiding their\r\nmoney. They sometimes conceal it between the boards of the boxes in\r\nwhich their eggs are packed, or stitch it into the stuffing of their\r\nasses' saddles.

Fruitful valleys, villages, and plantations, commodious\r\nsea-ports, and vast sandy wastes, alternate one with the other. Heat,\r\nsometimes almost insupportable, is succeeded by chilly and unhealthy\r\nmists; whilst here and there the scattered monuments of the wealth and\r\ngreatness of bygone ages present a remarkable and painful contrast to\r\npresent poverty and misery.\r\n\r\nProceeding southward of Lima by way of Lurin, we arrive at Chilca, a\r\nwretched village situated on a soil which affords nothing to supply the\r\nwants of human existence. It appears an incomprehensible mystery that\r\nman should have fixed his abode on a spot where Nature has granted\r\nnothing for his nourishment, not even a drop of pure water; whilst at\r\nthe distance of a few miles, luxuriant valleys offer, spontaneously,\r\nthose products which the most laborious toil must fail to extort from\r\nthe ungrateful soil of Chilca. The hope of wealth from commercial\r\nspeculation or mining industry has peopled many inhospitable shores, and\r\nhas raised populous towns on barren deserts; but at Chilca there are no\r\nsuch stimuli of interests. Nevertheless, they may possibly have existed\r\nin former ages, for the numerous ruins scattered around the village\r\ntend to confirm the opinion that the population was very extensive under\r\nthe government of the Incas. The force of custom and of local attachment\r\nwhich frequently chains man to the spot where his progenitors have lived\r\nhappily, is all that can bind the natives of Chilca to their miserable\r\ndwelling-place. In few villages, as in Chilca, have the Indians for more\r\nthan 300 years so carefully avoided mixing with people of other races.\r\nThey employ themselves in plaiting straw for hats and cigar-cases. The\r\nlatter they make in a singularly beautiful style with white and colored\r\nstraw, which they plait into various figures and patterns--sometimes\r\ninto names, and even lines of poetry. Some of these cigar-cases sell for\r\nupwards of a hundred dollars. Fishing is a less profitable occupation to\r\nthe people of Chilca, or, as they are called in the country, the\r\nChilqueños; for, owing to the great distance, only certain kinds of fish\r\ncan be sent to the Lima market. Near the village there is a bed of very\r\nstrong red-colored salt, which is exported to the mountains, but which\r\nsells at a lower price than the salt of Huacho.\r\n\r\nFive leagues south of Chilca, on the river of the same name, lies the\r\nvillage called Cañete, which is the residence of a Sub-prefect. The very\r\ninteresting province of Yauyos extends from this village in an easterly\r\ndirection towards the Cordilleras. The inhabitants of this province are\r\ndistinguishable by their faces and figures, and also by their manners\r\nand language, from the Indians of the coast and the mountains. In\r\nstature they are small. They have expanded foreheads, animated eyes,\r\nprominent cheek-bones, and wide mouths. Their limbs are slender, and\r\ntheir skin is of a swarthy brown. Their dialect, the Cauqui, contains\r\nmany radical words of the Quichua language. After this nation was\r\nsubjugated by the Incas their language was so intermixed with others,\r\nthat it is now very difficult to trace out its origin. It appears to be\r\ntotally different from the Chinchaysuyo language.\r\n\r\nSome very considerable sugar plantations, and several villages, lie\r\nbetween Cañete and Pisco. Among the villages, Lunahuana and Chincha\r\n(upper and lower) are celebrated for their great fertility. Two rivers,\r\nat the distance of five leagues from each other, flow in a parallel\r\ndirection between Chincha and Pisco, and to their waters the valleys are\r\nindebted for their rich vegetation. On account of their width these\r\nrivers can only be passed with the assistance of Chimbadores, and many\r\ntravellers annually perish in their incautious attempts to ford them.\r\nThe little town of Pisco is on the left bank of the south river, and\r\nhalf a league from it there is a secure harbor with good anchoring\r\nground. This town has acquired some importance by the exportation of\r\nbrandy; and it has recently become more active and populous owing to the\r\nnear vicinity of the Guano islands. The custom-house and the port\r\ncaptain's office are on the shore, where there is also a large building\r\nerected by Don Domingo Elias, for a brandy depôt. The little town of\r\nPisco has suffered much from the plundering attacks of European pirates,\r\nfrom earthquakes, and more recently from the War of Independence.\r\nSeveral parts of it have been rebuilt. Within the few last years much\r\nhas been done in the way of improving and ornamenting it. A broad trench\r\nhas been dug round the town, serving the purpose of drainage, and\r\nthereby greatly contributing to preserve the health of the place. Pisco\r\nis merely the key to the large interior town of Yca, which is fourteen\r\nleagues distant. I visited it in the year 1842. The steamer conveyed me\r\nin eighteen hours from Callao to Pisco, where I hired horses and a\r\nguide. He was a Catalonian, who had frequently travelled to Yca.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock, P. M., we left Pisco. At first the road passed over\r\nvery hard ground, then through deep sand, which continued till we got\r\nto Yca. Notwithstanding the heat, which in the month of February is\r\ninsupportable, I was wrapped up in my woollen poncho. Experience had\r\ntaught me that in the hotter districts the change of temperature which\r\ntakes place at night, and causes fever, is least injurious when the\r\ntraveller is protected in warm clothing. My Catalonian guide, who,\r\nwith his arms covered merely by his shirt sleeves, nevertheless\r\nsuffered greatly from the heat, could not comprehend why I had chosen\r\nsuch a dress. When I informed him that eleven days before I had, in\r\nthe same clothing, passed a night on the Cordilleras, in the midst of\r\nsnow, he shook his head in token of incredulity. Whilst the bell rang\r\nfor evening prayers we rode into the Huilla Curin Plantation, which\r\nis surrounded by a charming grove of palm trees. We stopped for a few\r\nmoments to gather some excellent figs. About midnight a heavy fog\r\nspread over the plain, and veiled from our sight a cross on the south,\r\nwhich had hitherto served to keep us in the right direction. We,\r\nhowever, advanced about a league farther. The Catalonian then often\r\nalighted to smell the sand, in order to ascertain whether we were\r\ntaking the proper course. This is a very good practical method; for in\r\ndeserts through which caravans frequently pass, the dung of the beasts\r\nof burthen mixed with the sand affords a sure indication of the track.\r\nWhen we had got about three quarters of a league farther on, we came\r\nclose against a rock, which my guide--in whose acquaintance with the\r\nlocality I had the most unbounded confidence--declared was quite\r\nunknown to him. There was therefore no doubt that we had got out of\r\nthe right course. I lighted a cigar, and on examining, by its feeble\r\nlight, my pocket compass, I discovered that instead of keeping to the\r\nsouth-east we had diverged to the west. As there was now no hope that\r\nthe fog would clear away before day-break, we rolled ourselves in the\r\nwarm sand, to await the coming morning.\r\n\r\nI afterwards learned that in this very spot numerous travellers had lost\r\ntheir way, and had perished of thirst. In the year 1823, a ship stranded\r\non this coast, with three hundred and twenty dragoons on board, under\r\nthe command of Colonel Lavalle. The soldiers succeeded in getting\r\nashore, but thirty-six hours afterwards they were lost in this sandy\r\ndesert. When intelligence of the shipwreck reached Pisco, a cavalry\r\nregiment was despatched to search for the sufferers, and to supply them\r\nwith provisions and water; but when they were found it was discovered\r\nthat one hundred and sixteen men had died from fatigue and thirst, and a\r\nfew days after fifty more perished from exhaustion. It is generally\r\nsupposed that a healthy man can live four or five days unsupplied with\r\nfood and drink. In the temperate climate of Europe, and with bodily\r\nrest, this, perhaps, may be the case; but in the burning wastes of Peru\r\nto be deprived of nourishment for only forty-eight hours, and at the\r\nsame time to wander about in deep sand, would be followed by certain\r\ndeath. Severe thirst is the most horrible of torments, especially when\r\nthe body is surrounded by a medium altogether of an arid nature. At sea\r\nit can be much longer endured than on a surface of sand.\r\n\r\nWhen the grey dawn of morning appeared we again mounted our horses, and\r\nrode by my compass in the direction of E.S.E. After riding a few\r\nleagues, we turned an acute angle, which brought us into the main road,\r\nand we arrived that forenoon in Yca.\r\n\r\nOn my return I so arranged my journey as to pass the night in Huilla\r\nCurin, where the horses were supplied with forage, consisting of the\r\nshoots and leaves of the Mastick-tree (_schinus molle_).\r\n\r\nYca is a moderately large and very agreeably situated town. Like most of\r\nthe larger towns on the coast it is peopled with inhabitants of all\r\ncolors, particularly Mestizos. It is the residence of a sub-prefect and\r\nmany rich planters. Scarcely anything but the vine is cultivated in the\r\nHaciendas of the environs; and this branch of husbandry contributes\r\ngreatly to enrich the province. It is astonishing to see with what\r\nfacility the vine thrives in a soil apparently so unfruitful. The young\r\nshoots are stuck into the sand almost half a foot deep, then tied up and\r\nleft to themselves. They quickly take root and shoot forth leaves.\r\nWhilst the surrounding country bears the appearance of a desert, the\r\nvineyards of Yca are clothed in delightful verdure. The grapes are of\r\nsuperior quality, very succulent and sweet. The greater part are used\r\nfor making brandy, which is extremely good and very well flavored. All\r\nPeru and a great part of Chile are supplied with this liquor from the\r\nVale of Yca. The common brandy is called _Aguardiente de Pisco_, because\r\nit is shipped at that port. A kind of brandy of superior quality, and\r\nmuch dearer, made from Muscatel grapes, is called _Aguardiente de\r\nItalia_. It is distinguished by a very exquisite flavor. Very little\r\nwine is made at Yca. In some plantations they make a thick dark-brown\r\nkind, which is very sweet, and much liked by the Peruvians, though not\r\nvery agreeable to a European palate. Only one planter, Don Domingo\r\nElias,[49] the richest and most speculative cultivator on the whole\r\ncoast, makes wine in the European manner. It is very like the wine of\r\nMadeira and Teneriffe, only it is more fiery, and contains a more\r\nconsiderable quantity of alcohol. Specimens which have been sent to\r\nEurope have obtained the unqualified approbation of connoisseurs. The\r\nflavor is considerably improved by a long sea voyage.\r\n\r\nThe brandy, which is exported by sea, is put into large vessels made of\r\nclay, called _botijas_. In form they are like a pear, the broad ends\r\nbeing downwards. At the top there is a small aperture, which is\r\nhermetically closed with gypsum. The large _botija_ when filled weighs\r\nsix or seven arobas. Two are a load for a mule. To the pack-saddle, or\r\n_aparejo_, two baskets are fastened, in which the _botijas_ are placed\r\nwith the small ends downwards. These _botijas_ were formerly also used\r\nfor conveying the brandy across the mountains; but, in consequence of\r\nthe dangerous, slippery roads, over which the mules often fell, many\r\nwere broken. Still greater damage was sustained at the springs and\r\nwells on the coast, for the poor animals, after their long journeys\r\nthrough the sandy wastes, rushed, on perceiving water, in full flight\r\nto the springs. As it happens that there is often room for only five\r\nor six mules, and from seventy to eighty were often pressing forward,\r\na great number of the _botijas_ were unavoidably dashed to pieces in\r\nspite of all the caution the arrieros could exercise. The annual loss\r\nof brandy was immense, and to counteract this evil, bags of goatskin\r\nwere introduced. These skins are now generally used for the\r\nconveyance of brandy across the mountains. The method of skinning the\r\ngoats is the most horribly cruel that can be conceived. A negro hangs\r\nthe living animal up by the horns, and makes a circular incision\r\nround his neck, which, however, goes no further than to the flesh. He\r\nthen draws the skin from the body of the writhing animal, which\r\nutters the most frightful cries. When the skin is completely removed,\r\nand not till then, is the suffering animal killed. The negroes assert\r\nthat the skin is most easily removed in this manner, and that the\r\n_odres_[50] become thereby more durable. It is to be hoped that\r\nhumanely disposed planters will soon put an end to this barbarous\r\nand unreasonable practice.\r\n\r\nI happened to be in Yca at the time of the celebration of the negro\r\ncarnival, which I will here briefly describe. In some of the principal\r\nstreets of the town large arches are erected, and gaily decorated with\r\nribbons. Round these arches negresses and mestizas dance, and endeavor\r\nto stop the negroes whilst riding at full gallop under the arches. The\r\nnegroes start from the distance of about one hundred paces, and gallop\r\nstraight to the boundary, where the women endeavor to seize the bridle,\r\nand to throw the rider from his saddle. The task of the men is to ride\r\npast the women without being stopped; and when they fail in so doing,\r\nthey have to pay a fine, and are hooted into the bargain. It is hard to\r\nsay which is most surprising;--the speed of the horses, the dexterity of\r\nthe riders, or the courage of the negresses, who fearlessly throw\r\nthemselves in the way of the galloping horses. During the race the\r\nnegroes are pelted with unripe oranges and lemons, which, when thrown by\r\nthe vigorous arm of a zamba, inflict a sufficiently heavy blow. I saw a\r\nnegro gallop to and fro for the space of an hour, at full speed, and\r\nevery time he passed under the arch he dexterously evaded the\r\noutstretched hands of the women; thus giving proof of uncommon bodily\r\nstrength. While dashing at full speed through the arch of the bridge,\r\nand leaning forward on the horse's neck, he seized two negresses, one\r\nwith each of his arms, and pulled them into the saddle beside him.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Yca is hot, and not altogether healthy, for the torrents\r\nof rain which fall from the hills swell the river so as to make it\r\noverflow its lower bank, where marshes are formed, in which malaria is\r\ndeveloped. Most of the plantations in the environs are more healthy.\r\n\r\nAll the bushes in the vicinity of the town are inhabited by a kind of\r\nGuinea pig (_Cavia Cuttleri_, King). These animals are exceedingly\r\nnumerous. After sunrise and towards evening, they leave their lurking\r\nplaces and play about in the grass. Upon the whole they are not shy,\r\nand they allow people to approach them pretty closely. The natives\r\ncall this little animal the _Cui del Montes_, and they believe it to\r\nbe the progenitor of the tame Guinea pig. This notion is, however,\r\nquite erroneous.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole of the Peruvian coast there is found a small animal of\r\nthe lizard kind, of which the natives are very much afraid. They call it\r\nthe _Salamanqueja_. It lives in the fissures of walls, and is sometimes\r\nseen creeping along the lime plaster of houses. Its bite is believed to\r\nbe mortal. From the descriptions given of this animal, I was curious to\r\nsee it, and I commissioned some persons to procure me one. At last, an\r\nIndian brought me a specimen very much crushed, and I found that I had\r\nalready got several of them in my collections. I now obtained more of\r\nthem, and the natives beheld me with astonishment carrying them alive in\r\nmy hand. Of the Salamanqueja there are two species, the _Diplodactylus\r\nlepidopygus_, Tsch., and the _Discodactylus phacophorus_, Tsch. They are\r\nnearly related to each other, being only distinguished by one species\r\nhaving an orifice in the thighs, serving as a passage for an issue from\r\na gland which secretes a very acrid fluid. This little animal never\r\nbites; but it is possible that the fluid by touching a fresh wound, or\r\nscratch, may cause very serious consequences.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Yca there are some large cotton plantations; the most\r\nconsiderable of which belong to Don Domingo Elias. The cotton for\r\nexportation is shipped at the port of San Nicolas. Many experienced\r\ncaptains of ships declare the bay of San Nicolas to be the safest and\r\nbest along the whole of the western coast of South America.\r\n\r\nThe Quebrada of Huaitara, which stretches to the east of Yca, is the\r\nprincipal channel of communication between this part of the coast and\r\nthe rich mountain provinces of Jauja and Huancavelica, and from the\r\nlatter places to Ayacucho and Cosco.\r\n\r\nOpposite to Pisco and Chinca there is a group of small islands, of which\r\nthe largest, Sangallan, is six English miles distant from Pisco. These\r\nislands have of late years become celebrated on account of the great\r\nquantity of guano that has been exported from them.\r\n\r\nGuano (or according to the more correct orthography, Huanu)[51] is\r\nfound on these islands in enormous layers of from 35 to 40 feet thick.\r\nThe upper strata are of a greyish-brown color, which lower down becomes\r\ndarker. In the lower strata the color is a rusty red, as if tinged by\r\noxide of iron. The Guano becomes progressively more and more solid from\r\nthe surface downward, a circumstance naturally accounted for by the\r\ngradual deposite of the strata, and the evaporation of the fluid\r\nparticles. Guano is found on all the islands, and on most of the\r\nuninhabited promontories of the west coast of South America, especially\r\nin those parts within the tropics. I have often been assured that beds\r\nof Guano several feet high, covered with earth, are found inland at some\r\ndistance from the sea; but I never met with any, and I have some doubt\r\nof the correctness of the statement. If, however, these inland strata\r\nreally exist, I am inclined to believe that they can only be found on\r\nhilly ground; and in that case they afford strong evidence of a\r\nconsiderable elevation of the coast.\r\n\r\nGuano is formed of the excrements of different kinds of marine birds,\r\nas mews, divers, sheerbeaks, &c.; but the species which I can name\r\nwith more precision are the following:--_Larus modestus_, Tsch.;\r\n_Rhinchops nigra_, Lin.; _Plotus Anhinga_, Lin.; _Pelecanus thayus_,\r\nMol.; _Phalacrocorax Gaimardii_, and _albigula_, Tsch. (_Pelecanus\r\nGaimardii_, Less., _Carbo albigula_, Brandt), and chiefly the _Sula\r\nvariegata_, Tsch.\r\n\r\nThe immense flocks of these birds as they fly along the coast appear\r\nlike clouds. When their vast numbers, their extraordinary voracity, and\r\nthe facility with which they procure their food, are considered, one\r\ncannot be surprised at the magnitude of the beds of Guano, which have\r\nresulted from uninterrupted accumulations during many thousands of\r\nyears. I kept for some days a living _Sula variegata_, which I fed\r\nabundantly with fish. The average weight of the excrement daily was\r\nfrom 3-1/2 to five ounces. I have no doubt that when the bird is in a\r\nstate of freedom the weight must be much greater, for these birds are\r\nconstantly plunging into the sea, in order to devour the fishes which\r\nthey find in extraordinary masses around all the islands. When an\r\nisland is inhabited by millions of sea-birds, though two-thirds of\r\nthe guano should be lost while flying, still a very considerable\r\nstratum would be accumulated in the course of a year.\r\n\r\nThe marine birds nestle on the uninhabited islands, or on rocks near the\r\nshore; but they never settle on the flat beach, or any place distant\r\nfrom it inland. On this fact, I ground my conjecture that those beds of\r\nguano in the interior, which may have been removed from the shore by\r\nimportant elevations of the coast, are to be found only on hills.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the deposit the strata are white, and the guano\r\nis then called _Guano Blanco_. In the opinion of the Peruvian\r\ncultivators, this is the most efficacious kind. It is found in the Punta\r\nde Hormillos, on the islands of Islay, Jesus, Margarita, &c.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the dealers in guano begin to work one of the beds, the\r\nisland on which it is formed, is abandoned by the birds. It has also\r\nbeen remarked, that since the increase of trade and navigation, they\r\nhave withdrawn from the islands in the neighborhood of the ports.\r\n\r\nMuch has recently been written on the employment and utility of guano;\r\nbut the manner in which it is applied as manure in Peru, seems to be but\r\nlittle known. The Peruvians use it chiefly in the cultivation of maize\r\nand potatoes. A few weeks after the seeds begin to shoot, a little\r\nhollow is dug round each root, and is filled up with guano, which is\r\nafterwards covered with a layer of earth. After the lapse of twelve or\r\nfifteen hours, the whole field is laid under water, and is left in that\r\nstate for some hours. Of the _Guano Blanco_ a less quantity suffices,\r\nand the field must be more speedily and abundantly watered, otherwise\r\nthe roots would be destroyed. The effect of this manure is incredibly\r\nrapid. In a few days the growth of a plant is doubled. If the manure be\r\nrepeated a second time, but in smaller quantity, a rich harvest is\r\ncertain. At least, the produce will be threefold that which would have\r\nbeen obtained from the unmanured soil.\r\n\r\nThe haciendas of the valley of Chancay have, during the last fifty\r\nyears, consumed annually from 33,000 to 36,000 bushels of guano brought\r\nfrom the islands of Chancha and Pisco. The price of the bushel of\r\ncolored guano is one dollar and a quarter, and the price of the white\r\nfrom two to three dollars. The price has recently undergone many\r\nfluctuations, in consequence of the great exports to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe employment of this kind of manure is very ancient in Peru; and there\r\nis authentic evidence of its having been used in the time of the Incas.\r\nThe white guano was then chiefly found on the islands opposite to\r\nChincha; so that for upwards of 600 years the deposit has been\r\nprogressively removed from those islands without any apparent decrease\r\nof the accumulation. The uniformity of climate on a coast where there is\r\nnot much rain, must contribute to render the Peruvian guano a more arid\r\nmanure than the African, as fewer of the saline particles of the former\r\nbeing in solution, they are consequently less subject to evaporation.\r\n\r\nFrom 3° 35' to 21° 48' south latitude, a plain of sand, 540 leagues\r\nlong, and varying from 3 to 20 leagues in breadth, stretches along the\r\ncoast of the Pacific Ocean. It is intersected by chains of small\r\nhillocks, which, extending westward from the Cordilleras, gradually\r\ndiminish in height, and either become blended with the plain, or form\r\nabrupt promontories, which project into the sea. Between the river Loa,\r\nwhich marks the southern frontier of the Peruvian coast, and the Tumbez,\r\non the northern boundary, fifty-nine rivers, great and small, pass\r\nthrough the line of coast. Proceeding from the avalanches of the Andes\r\nor the small alpine lakes, they force their way through narrow\r\nmountain-valleys, irrigate the waste grounds, and then, after brief\r\ncourses, flow into the great ocean.\r\n\r\nA fine light yellow drift sand covers hill and dale. It is only where\r\nrivers intersect the plain that oases of luxuriant vegetation are\r\nformed. The peril of traversing these plains is greatly increased by\r\nthe movability of the sand and the _Medanos_. The strong winds raise\r\nimmense clouds of dust and sand. The sand rises in columns of from\r\neighty to a hundred feet high, which whirl about in all directions, as\r\nif moved by magic. Sometimes they suddenly overshadow the traveller, who\r\nonly escapes from them by rapid riding.\r\n\r\nThe medanos are hillock-like elevations of sand, some having a firm,\r\nothers a loose base. The former, which are always crescent-shaped, are\r\nfrom ten to twenty feet high, and have an acute crest. The inner side is\r\nperpendicular, and the outer or bow side forms an angle with a steep\r\ninclination downward. When driven by violent winds, the medanos pass\r\nrapidly over the plains. The smaller and lighter ones move quickly\r\nforwards before the larger ones; but the latter soon overtake and crush\r\nthem, whilst they are themselves shivered by the collision. These\r\nmedanos assume all sorts of extraordinary figures, and sometimes move\r\nalong the plain in rows forming most intricate labyrinths, whereby what\r\nmight otherwise be visible in the distance is withdrawn from the view of\r\nthe traveller. A plain often appears to be covered with a row of\r\nmedanos, and some days afterwards it is again restored to its level and\r\nuniform aspect. Persons who have the greatest experience of the coast\r\nare apt to mistake their way, when they encounter these sand-hills.\r\n\r\nThe medanos with immovable bases are formed on the blocks of rock which\r\nare scattered about the plain. The sand is driven against them by the\r\nwind, and as soon as it reaches the top point it descends on the other\r\nside until that is likewise covered; thus gradually arises a\r\nconical-formed hill. Entire hillock-chain with acute crests are formed\r\nin a similar manner. The small hillock-chain, by which the coast is\r\nintersected obliquely from east to west, is a boundary which arrests the\r\nprogress of the wandering medanos; otherwise fruitful oases would soon\r\nbe converted into barren sand-flats. A correct observation of these\r\nhillock-chains affords a most certain scale for ascertaining the\r\ndirection of the prevailing wind. On their southern declivities are\r\nfound vast masses of sand drifted thither by the mid-day gales. The\r\nnorthern declivity, though not steeper than the southern, is only\r\nsparingly covered with sand. If a hillock-chain somewhat distant from\r\nthe sea extends in a line parallel with the Andes, namely from S.S.E. to\r\nN.N.W., the western declivity is almost entirely free of sand, as it is\r\ndriven to the plain below by the southeast wind, which constantly\r\nalternates with the wind from the south.\r\n\r\nThe movements and new formations in the deserts (like restorations\r\nfrom death to life) are only in full activity during the hot season;\r\nfor then the parched sand yields to the slightest pressure of the\r\natmosphere. In the cold season its weight increases by the absorption\r\nof humidity. The particles unite in masses, and more easily resist\r\nthe wind. In the meantime the hillocks also acquire more firmness or\r\ncompression by the increased weight which presses on them from above.\r\n\r\nIn November, summer commences. The rays of the sun are refracted on the\r\nlight grey sandy carpet, and are reflected back with scorching power.\r\nEvery living thing which does not quickly escape from their influence is\r\ndevoted to certain destruction. No plant takes root in the burning soil,\r\nand no animal finds food on the arid lifeless surface. No bird, no\r\ninsect moves in the burning atmosphere. Only in the very loftiest\r\nregions, the king of the air, the majestic condor, may be seen floating,\r\nwith daring wing, on his way to the sea coast. Only where the ocean and\r\nthe desert blend with each other is there life and movement. Flocks of\r\ncarrion crows swarm over the dead remains of marine animals scattered\r\nalong the shore. Otters and seals impart life to the inaccessible rocks;\r\nhosts of coast birds eagerly pounce on the fish and mollusca cast on\r\nshore; variegated lizards sport on the sand hillocks; and busy crabs and\r\nsea spiders work their way by furrows through the humid coast.\r\n\r\nThe scene changes in May. A thin veil of mist then overspreads the sea\r\nand the shore. In the following months the thickness of the mist\r\nincreases, and it is only in October that it begins to disperse. In the\r\nbeginning and at the end of the period called winter this mist commonly\r\nrises between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and disappears about\r\nthree, P.M. It is heaviest in August and September; and it then lies for\r\nweeks immoveable on the earth. It does not resolve into what may be\r\nproperly called rain, but it becomes a fine minute precipitate which the\r\nnatives call GARUA (thick fog or drizzling rain). Many travellers have\r\nalleged that there are places on the Peruvian coast which have been\r\nwithout rain for centuries. The assertion is to a certain degree\r\ncorrect, for there are many districts in which there never is rain\r\nexcept after an earthquake, and not always even then.\r\n\r\nThough the _garua_ sometimes falls in large drops, still there is\r\nthis distinction between it and rain, that it descends not from\r\nclouds at a great height, but is formed in the lower atmospheric\r\nregions, by the union of small bubbles of mist. The average\r\nperpendicular height over which this fog passes does not exceed one\r\nthousand two hundred feet; its medium boundary is from seven to eight\r\nhundred feet. That it is known only within a few miles of the sea is\r\na highly curious phenomenon; beyond those few miles it is superseded\r\nby heavy rains; and the boundary line between the rain and the mist\r\nmay be defined with mathematical precision. I know two plantations,\r\nthe one six leagues from Lima, the other in the neighborhood of\r\nHuacho: one half of these lands is watered by the garuas, the other\r\nhalf by rain, and the boundary line is marked by a wall.\r\n\r\nWhen the mists set in, the chain of hillocks (_Lomas_) bordering the\r\nsand-flats on the coasts undergoes a complete change. As if by a stroke\r\nof magic, blooming vegetation overspreads the soil, which, a few days\r\npreviously, was a mere barren wilderness. Horses and cattle are driven\r\ninto these parts for grazing, and during several months the animals find\r\nabundance of rich pasture. There is, however, no water; but they do not\r\nappear to suffer from the want of it, for they are always in good\r\nhealthy condition on leaving the Lomas.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of northern Peru, where the garuas are scanty, the\r\nfertility of the soil depends wholly on the mountain rains, for in\r\nsummer most of the rivers are dried up. When there is a deficiency of\r\nrain, the cattle on the coast suffer greatly. A few years ago a\r\nhaciendado, or cultivator, in the vale of Piura, lost 42,000 sheep;\r\nthe usual flood, without which the necessary fodder could not be\r\nraised, did not come on at the proper time. At Piura there is such a\r\ntotal absence of dew, that a sheet of paper left for a whole night\r\nin the open air does not, in the morning, exhibit the smallest trace\r\nof humidity. In central and south Peru the moisture scarcely\r\npenetrates half an inch into the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the oases the garuas are much heavier than in the adjacent wastes.\r\nAlong the whole of the coast there is no rain, and no vegetation\r\nthroughout a large circuit. The rain commences first in the north at\r\nTumbez, and there extensive woods are seen. Towards the east it begins\r\nfirst in the valleys of the Cordilleras, which abound in vegetation.\r\nThese very extraordinary phenomena remain as yet unexplained; they,\r\nhowever, merit the closest investigation of meteorologists.\r\n\r\nI may conclude this chapter by a brief view of the Fauna of the higher\r\nvertebral animals. In the region of the coast I have found twenty-six\r\nspecies of mammalia, only eight of which belong exclusively to the\r\ncoast. Sixteen of the other species are to be found in the mountains or\r\nin the forests. The relation of this number to the whole of the mammalia\r\nof Peru is 1:4, 3. Distributed by single orders, they are in the\r\nfollowing proportions:--Bats, four species, of which only one\r\n(_Vespertilio innoxius_, Gerv.) belongs to this region alone. Beasts of\r\nprey, ten kinds; among them one of the mephitic class, known to the\r\nnatives by the name of _zorillo_, or _añash_; an otter (_Lutra\r\nchilensis_, Ben.); a fox (_Canis azaræ_, Pr. Max.), which abounds in the\r\ncotton plantations in the neighborhood of Lima and throughout all the\r\nLomas, where he preys on the lambs; several of the feline race, among\r\nwhich are the two great American species--the puma and the ounce, which\r\nare seldom seen on the coast, but are considerably larger than those in\r\nthe mountains. The American lion is timid, and shuns man. When caught\r\nyoung he is easily tamed. The Indians of the northern provinces\r\nsometimes bring these lions to Lima, and get money for showing them.\r\nThey lead them by a string, or put them in large sacks, and carry them\r\nabout on their backs, until a show-loving crowd assembles around them.\r\nThe ounces are very bold and fierce. They penetrate into plantations,\r\nand attack children and horses. They very cunningly avoid the numerous\r\nsnares laid for them by the Indians. An encounter with this animal is\r\nserious and dangerous. A hunt seldom ends without some of the pursuers\r\nbeing killed or wounded by the animal.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the seals. There are three kinds of didelphic\r\nor marsupial animals on the coast. The natives call them _mucamuca_.\r\nThey live in bushes and shrubberies, and they often find their way into\r\nthe store-rooms of the plantations.\r\n\r\nOf the great section of the _Rodentia_, I know of only seven species in\r\nPeru; but I have no doubt that this number might be doubled by a careful\r\nsearch in the valleys on the coast. The common house-mouse is very\r\nnumerous in Lima. The brown rat appears seldom. It came to Peru only a\r\nfew years ago; but there is reason to apprehend that it will soon be\r\nvery numerous. Probably it has been imported by Hamburgh ships. In\r\nCallao I saw specimens of some that had been killed. I did not see the\r\ncommon black rat in Peru.\r\n\r\nThe Armadillo (_Dasypus tatuay, Desm._, L.) is seldom seen. It is found\r\nin some of the Yucca and Camote plantations. The negroes eat it, and its\r\nflesh is said to be good.\r\n\r\nOf wild ruminating animals there is only one on the coast: it is a kind\r\nof Roe (_Cervus nemorivagus_, F. Cuv., the _venado_ of the natives). The\r\nvenados chiefly inhabit the brushwood along the coast; but after sunset\r\nthey visit the plantations, where they commit considerable damage. They\r\nare smaller than our European roe, and somewhat more brown. Englishmen\r\nat Lima go out to hunt them. The natives do not take much interest in\r\nthe chase. This animal is also met with in the coldest regions of the\r\nCordilleras; but it does not come down to the old forests, where the Red\r\nDeer (_Cervus rufus_, F. Cuv.) supplies its absence.\r\n\r\nIn the woods which surround some of the plantations in the valleys of\r\nLima, wild boars (_Chanchos Simarones_) are occasionally found. They are\r\nof immense size. At the plantation called the _Hacienda de Caraponga_,\r\none was killed, of which the head alone was an ordinary burthen for a\r\nmule.\r\n\r\nThe number of birds in this very extensive quarter of Peru (the marine\r\nand river fowl being excepted) is very inconsiderable. The scarcity of\r\nwoods and high trees may probably account for this. Besides the carrion\r\nvulture, condors collect in great numbers on the shore to prey on the\r\nstranded whales. Falcons seldom appear, except the small Sparrow Hawk\r\n(_Falco sparverius_, L.), which is very numerous in Peru. One of the\r\nmost common birds is the little Earth Owl (_Noctua urucurea_, Less.),\r\nwhich is met with in nearly all the old ruins scattered along the coast.\r\nThe Pearl Owl (_Strix perlata_, L.) is bred in several plantations, as\r\nit is found useful in catching mice. Swallows are not very common; they\r\ndo not nestle on the housetops, but on walls at some distance from\r\ntowns. The Peruvians give them the euphonious name, _Palomitas de Santa\r\nRosa_ (Santa Rosa's little pigeons). Among the singing-birds the Crowned\r\nFly King (_Myoarchus coronatus_, Cab.) is the most distinguished. The\r\nhead, breast, and belly of this bird are deep red, the wings and back\r\nvery dark brown. He always plants himself on the highest point of a\r\ntree, flies perpendicularly upward, whirls about in the air singing, and\r\ndrops down again straight to his former perch. The Limeños have given\r\nthis elegant bird a very unbecoming name, which I need not repeat here.\r\nOn some parts of the coast it is called _Saca-tu-real_ (draw out your\r\nreal), because his song sounds like these words. Some fine Tanagers\r\n(_Tanagra frugilega_, Tsch.; _Tanagra analis_, Tsch.) visit the fruit\r\ngardens round Lima. I saw two birds, of the starling species, the\r\nred-bellied Picho (_Sturnella militaris_, Viell.), and the\r\nglossy-black Chivillo (_Cassicus palliatus_, Tsch.), which are kept\r\nin cages on account of their very melodious song. Three kinds of\r\nparrots, which abound in the valleys on the coast, commit great\r\ndepredations in the maize fields. The largest (_Conurus tumultuosus_,\r\nTsch.) is green, with a red forehead, and some red feathers scattered\r\nover the body. A second sort builds its nest chiefly on the sides of\r\nrocks (_Conurus rupicola_, Tsch.), and only occasionally visits the\r\nplantations. The third is the smallest, but at the same time the most\r\nbeautiful of the whole (_Conurus sitophaga_, Tsch.). A fine green\r\noverspreads all the upper part of the body, a blue fringe borders the\r\nfeathers of the wings; and a bright citron-yellow is diffused over\r\nthe forehead, neck, breast, and belly. It is only seven inches long.\r\nPigeons, large and small, swarm in such multitudes over the\r\ncorn-fields, and in the environs, that they may almost be called the\r\ngreat plague of the country. One of the finest is the little\r\n_Turtuli_ (_Chaemepelia gracilis_, Tsch.), on the wing of which\r\nthere is a row of very beautiful shining violet spots. The _Cuculi_,\r\none of the largest pigeons, is a great favorite. It is kept much in\r\ncages. Its song, which is monotonous, yet very melodious, is kept up\r\nfrom the earliest hours of the morning until midday, and it begins\r\nagain nearly at sunset. The song consists merely of a threefold\r\nrepetition of _cu-cu-li_. After a pause, it resumes the song again.\r\nThere are, however, some of those birds which repeat the _cuculi_\r\noftener than thrice, and their price increases according to the\r\nnumber of their uninterrupted repetitions, which seldom exceed five\r\nor six. In Cocachacra, however, I heard one of these birds which\r\nrepeated its _cuculi_ fourteen times. The owner would not sell it\r\nunder fourteen gold ounces.\r\n\r\nThe amphibia on the Peruvian coast are proportionally much better\r\nrepresented than the two foregoing classes. The gigantic tortoises\r\n(_Chelonia imbricata_ and _Ch. midas_, Schweig.) visit in great\r\nnumbers the few little frequented inlets. The elephant tortoise\r\n(_Testudo Schweigeri_) is often found on some islands, and in the\r\nmarshy mouths of several rivers.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of Crocodiles (_Champsa sclerops_ and _Ch. fissipes_, Wagl.)\r\ninhabit the Rio de la Chira. They grow to the length of fourteen\r\nor fifteen feet.\r\n\r\nAmong the lizard class of reptiles, very large bright green Iguanas are\r\nfound on the south coast; for instance, in the Caletas near Merillones,\r\n&c.; but there are great numbers of the land Agama, of which I found\r\nseveral new species, viz., _Steirolepis tigris_, _thoracica_,\r\n_quadrivittata_, _xanthostigma_, Tsch.; _Liolaemus elegans_, Tsch.;\r\n_Ctenoblepharys adspersa_, Tsch., &c., &c. I have already mentioned the\r\nGecko, called the _Salamanqueja_.\r\n\r\nSerpents upon the whole are rather seldom seen. They belong to\r\ndifferent kinds, some poisonous, some innoxious (for example,\r\n_Zacholus_, _Psammophis_, _Oxyrrhopus_, _Siphlophis_, _Ophis_, _Elaps_,\r\n&c., &c.). A very poisonous viper (_Echidna ocellata_, Tsch.) inhabits\r\nthe sugar-cane fields. Its bite is almost instantaneously mortal.\r\n\r\nThe genuine frog is not to be found on the coast, and of the bladder\r\nfrog only two kinds are known (_Cystignathus roseus_ and _nodosus_,\r\nDum. Bibr.). I have found three amphibia of the toad class. The Thorn\r\ntoad (_Bufo spinulosus_, Wiegam.), which has its body thickly covered\r\nwith a thorny kind of warts. The beautiful red spotted toad (_Bufo\r\nthaul_), and a very curious and ugly kind with a round, swelled out\r\nbody, a loose skin, and a large bladder under the chin (_Anaxyrus\r\nmelancholicus_, Tsch.). At night the cry of this animal is a discordant\r\nmelancholy howl.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Elias is eminent not only as an extensive landowner and\r\ncultivator, but as a statesman.

One runs\r\nnorthward through the valley of Canta, in the direction of the rich\r\nsilver mines of Cerro de Pasco; the other, taking a more southerly\r\ndirection, passes through the Quebrada of Matucanas, to the villages of\r\nTarma, Jauja, and Huancayo; and still further south, leads to\r\nHuancavelica, Ayacucho, and Cuzco. All the roads running from the coast\r\nto the Sierra, present a similarity of character. Taking an oblique\r\ndirection from the margin of the coast, they run into one or other of\r\nthe fan-shaped Cordillera valleys, all of which are intersected by\r\nrivers. Following the course of these rivers, the roads become steeper\r\nand steeper, and the valleys soon contract into mere ravines,\r\nterminating at the foot of the Cordillera. The traveller then threads\r\nhis way up the acclivity, amidst stupendous masses of rock, until he\r\nreaches the lofty ridge. Then a gradual descent leads to the level\r\nheights, and thence into the deep mountain valleys.\r\n\r\nFormer travellers having already described the route by way of Canta, I\r\nwill here trace the course through the Quebrada of Matucanas. In so\r\ndoing, I am enabled to present to the reader the results of some\r\nbarometrical observations which are the more interesting, inasmuch as\r\nthe Cordillera here advances more nearly to the coast than at any other\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe most easterly gate of the city of Lima (the Portada de Maravillas)\r\nopens upon a broad road, which runs directly eastward. At the distance\r\nof about a league and a half from the city, the road passes over a stone\r\nbridge called the _Puente de Surco_, a place famed for robbers. At this\r\npoint the surrounding country presents a wild and dreary aspect. Ranges\r\nof grey and barren hills encompass the valley; the ground is for the\r\nmost part covered with sand and gravel. Desolate remains of plantations\r\nand the ruins of habitations bear evidence of the life and activity that\r\nonce animated this desert region, now abandoned by all save the fierce\r\nbandit and his victim, the solitary traveller.\r\n\r\nAlong the margins of the river, patches of moor-ground here and there\r\nserve as pasture. Clover and maize are produced only in those parts\r\nwhere the soil is manured and artificially watered. Low brushwood and\r\nreeds, growing on the banks of the Rimac, supply firewood to the city of\r\nLima, and are a source of profit to some of the plantation-owners in\r\nthe valley. At Periachi, four leagues from the capital, the road takes\r\na turn to north-east, and continues in that direction, with but little\r\ndeviation, as far as the base of the Cordillera. Two leagues beyond\r\nPariachi we reach Chaclacayo, a village containing about thirty\r\nmiserable reed huts. The plantation of Santa Iñes, a little further\r\non, is situated at 2386 feet above the level of the sea.[52] Mr.\r\nMaclean, an English merchant in Lima, who has sent many interesting\r\nPeruvian plants to the hothouses of England, and who has made some\r\nvery attentive barometrical observations during a journey in the\r\ninterior of the country, calculates the altitude of Chaclacayo at 2265\r\nfeet above the sea.[53] Rivero makes it 2010 feet above that level.[54]\r\nThe difference between these calculations is remarkable; and in more\r\nconsiderable altitudes the discrepancy is still more considerable, being\r\nsometimes as much as from eight to nine hundred feet. I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that it is attributable less to inaccuracy of observation than\r\nto the very imperfect instrument made use of by Rivero. Maclean's\r\nobservations, with some trifling exceptions, correspond with mine. He\r\nused one of Fortin's barometers, and I one of Lefevre's, which, prior to\r\nmy departure from Europe, had, during several weeks, been regulated at\r\nthe observatory in Paris. Unluckily, this excellent instrument was\r\ninjured by a fall from my horse, and I found it impossible to get it\r\nrepaired. Some barometrical observations made by M. C. Gay, during a\r\njourney in Peru, in the years 1839-40, with one of Bunten's barometers,\r\ndeviate very considerably from all those above mentioned. Between the\r\ncalculations of Gay and Rivero there is an average difference of from\r\nsix hundred to one thousand feet.\r\n\r\nOn the road to Pasco, the Hacienda of Cavallero corresponds, in its\r\ndistance from the capital, with the village of Chaclacayo, on the road I\r\nam here describing. At Chaclacayo wheat and sugar are cultivated. The\r\nsugar cane thrives well, and might be grown in greater quantity. In some\r\nof the coast districts I have seen the sugar cane cultivated at the\r\nheight of 4500 feet above the sea; and I have seen it grow\r\nspontaneously, and attain perfect maturity, as high as 6800 feet.\r\n\r\nFrom Santa Iñes the road continues gradually ascending to the little\r\nvillage of San Pedro Mama, where the two rivers, San Mateo and Santa\r\nOlaya, unite and form the Rimac. The walls of mountain which enclose the\r\nvalley here rise almost perpendicularly, and afford nestling-places for\r\nsmall, richly-plumed parrots (_Conurus rupicola_, Tsch.). I was much\r\nsurprised to see these birds inhabiting the barren rocks, as the parrot\r\nalways dwells in woody regions, and is found in other places only when\r\non its passage. I know no other species of this family, save the one I\r\nhave just mentioned, which permanently nestles on mountains.\r\n\r\nThree leagues beyond San Pedro lies the village of Cocachacra. It is a\r\nsmall and poor place, but is picturesquely situated, and enjoys a fine\r\nclimate. Its name, signifying _coca-field_, or _plantation_, denotes\r\nthat coca must formerly have been cultivated here. At present that\r\nplant is not grown in any part near the coast, as it requires a damp and\r\nvery warm climate. Cocachacra is 5386 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nMaclean fixes the altitude of San Pedro Mama, Santa Olaya, and\r\nCocachacra, at 5331 feet. Supposing this calculation to be correct with\r\nrespect to the latter village, it cannot also apply to San Pedro Mama\r\nand Santa Olaya, which lie much lower. At the two last-mentioned places\r\nI made no barometrical observations.\r\n\r\nOn the Pasco road the hamlet of Llanga is situated, at twelve leagues\r\nfrom Lima. On the other road Cocachacra is the same distance from the\r\ncapital; but Cocachacra is about 2400 feet higher than Llanga. Between\r\nCavallero and Llanga there is an interesting geological phenomenon,\r\nwhich I will here describe.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of two leagues from Lima the road takes a turn. At first\r\nit runs direct north, or north-north-west; suddenly it turns to\r\nnorth-north-east, and advances along the bank of the river Chillon as\r\nfar as Cavallero. From thence, with slight deviations, it continues in\r\nthe same course to Llanga, but at a considerable distance from the\r\nriver, as the latter takes a wide sweep northward. From Cavallero the\r\nroad runs for the space of three leagues, still ascending, through a\r\nbarren district, along the dry bed of a river, called the Rio Seco. The\r\nlast half-league of the way is very steep, and leads to the ridge of a\r\nchain of hillocks running diagonally across the valley. The ground is\r\nstrewed with fragments of porphyry and other kinds of rock, like the bed\r\nof the Rimac. On reaching the ridge of the line of hillocks, the\r\ntraveller beholds on the other side a hollow basin, like the dry bed of\r\na lake: a furrow, extending lengthwise through this hollow, is the\r\ncontinuation of the bed of the river which is intersected by the chain\r\nof hills. Descending into the valley, and again following the course of\r\nthe Rio Seco to the distance of about three leagues, we reach the\r\nvillage of Alcocoto, and once more arrive on the bank of the Rio de\r\nChillon.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, we have evidence of the following remarkable facts,\r\nviz.:--that at some former period the river of Chillon flowed\r\nnorth-westward from Alcocoto to Cavallero, in the bed that is now\r\ndry; and that a chain of hills has been upheaved diagonally across the\r\nvalley and the river. By this chain of hills the water, being dammed\r\nup, formed a lake; then it was again driven back; until the stream\r\nbroke into a new course at Alcocoto, by which means the lake emptied\r\nitself, and, having no new supply of water, it dried up. Now the Rio\r\nde Chillon flows from Alcocoto to Cavallero, taking a wide turn, first\r\nwestward, next south-westward, and lastly, direct south, until, at a\r\nsharp angle, it unites with the old bed of the river. The point of\r\njunction is a quarter of a mile from the Hacienda Cavallero. This is,\r\nhowever, not a solitary example of the course of a river being\r\ninterrupted by the uplifting of a ridge of hills. A similar instance\r\nis mentioned by Mr. Darwin, who, however, did not see it himself, but\r\nwho describes it as follows, from the observation of his countryman,\r\nMr. Gill, the engineer:--\r\n\r\n\"Travelling from Casma to Huaraz, not far distant from Lima, he (Mr.\r\nGill) found a plain covered with ruins and marks of ancient cultivation,\r\nbut now quite barren. Near it was the dry course of a considerable\r\nriver, whence the water for irrigation had formerly been conducted.\r\nThere was nothing in the appearance of the water-course to indicate that\r\nthe river had not flowed there a few years previously; in some parts,\r\nbeds of sand and gravel were spread out; in others, the solid rock had\r\nbeen worn into a broad channel, which in one spot was about forty yards\r\nin breadth, and eight feet deep. It is self-evident that a person\r\nfollowing up the course of a stream will always ascend at a greater or\r\nless inclination. Mr. Gill, therefore, was much astonished, when walking\r\nup the bed of this ancient river, to find himself suddenly going down\r\nhill. He imagined that the downward slope had a fall of about forty or\r\nfifty feet perpendicular. We here have unequivocal evidence that a ridge\r\nhad been uplifted right across the old bed of the stream. From the\r\nmoment the river-course was thus arched the water must necessarily have\r\nbeen thrown back, and a new channel formed. From that period, also, the\r\nneighboring plain must have lost its fertilizing stream, and become a\r\ndesert.\"[55]\r\n\r\nThe inference here deduced is, that the rising took place at a period\r\nwhen the district was inhabited and cultivated by men. Of the period\r\nof the uplifting between Cavallero and Alcocoto I could discern no\r\nproofs. But the impression produced by the dry river bed involuntarily\r\nsuggests the idea that, at no very distant period, it must have been\r\nthe lodgment of a stream; for it is in all respects similar to the\r\ntemporary dry river beds so frequently met with on the coast of Peru.\r\n\r\nI made repeated visits to the Rio Seco, and I always contemplated with\r\nwonder the curious deviation of the river's course. But I must candidly\r\nconfess that during my abode in Peru, I did not venture to attribute\r\nthat deviation to so partial an uplifting; for I was ignorant of the\r\nexistence of any similar phenomenon which would have supported such an\r\nopinion. Now, however, the example referred to by the eminent English\r\ngeologist, and which has its existence on the same coast of Peru, sets\r\nall my doubts at rest, and I am quite convinced of the correctness of\r\nMr. Darwin's view of the subject.\r\n\r\nHaving made this digression, I must now carry the reader back to\r\nCocachacra. Pursuing the road to the distance of three leagues further,\r\nwe arrive at San Geronimo de Surco. The valley in this part becomes more\r\ncontracted; but on the whole its character is unchanged, with the\r\nexception that the mountains gradually become higher and steeper, and\r\nthe soil less fertile. The road frequently runs along lofty walls of\r\nrock, or winds round sharp projections, which overhang deep chasms, in\r\npassing which the greatest precaution is requisite.\r\n\r\nIn several of the valleys on the road from the coast to the Sierra, and\r\nabove all in the valley of Surco, there are certain springs, the water\r\nof which the Indians never drink. When a stranger unguardedly approaches\r\none of these springs for the purpose of quenching his thirst, he is\r\nsaluted by warning cries of _Es agua de Veruga!_ (It is veruga water!)\r\nEven horses and mules are not suffered to refresh themselves at these\r\nsprings, where the water is supposed to have the effect of producing a\r\ndisorder called the _Verugas_. As the existence of this disease is not\r\nknown in any other country, there appears ground for believing that it\r\nhas its origin in certain local circumstances. The verugas first\r\nmanifests itself by sore throat, pains in the bones, and other feverish\r\nsymptoms. In the course of a few days an eruption of red-colored\r\npimples, or boils, appears. These pimples sometimes increase in\r\nmagnitude, till, in some parts of the body, they become nearly as large\r\nas an egg, and blood flows from them to such an excess, that the\r\nstrength of the patient is exhausted, and consumption frequently\r\nfollows. From the small verugas the flow of blood is greatest. I knew an\r\ninstance of a half-caste Indian who from a small veruga below the ankle\r\nlost two pounds of blood.\r\n\r\nI was not able to trace this disease to any other cause than that which\r\nthe Indians assign to it. At all events, it is certain that travellers\r\nwho abstain from drinking the water of the condemned springs, escape the\r\nverugas; whilst those who only once taste such water, are attacked by\r\nthe disorder. It is the same with mules and horses. One of my mules\r\nwhich drank veruga water was attacked by a large tumor on the leg. The\r\ndisease is notoriously prevalent in the village of Santa Olaya.\r\n\r\nThe medical treatment of the Verugas by the Indians is quite empirical.\r\nThey administer to the patient the infusion of a plant which they call\r\n_Huajra-Huajra_; that is, Horn-Horn.[56] I never witnessed any\r\nconvincing proof of its efficacy. Its operation appears to be merely\r\nsudorific. A preparation of white maize is also frequently given, and\r\nit has the effect of assisting the action of the skin. When the\r\neruption of the verugas is tardy, a few spoonfuls of wine are found to\r\nbe of great service. Sudorific and purifying medicines, together with\r\ncutting out the large verugas, and keeping the wounds for a time in a\r\nstate of suppuration, have heretofore been found the best mode of\r\ntreatment. An accurate chemical analysis of the water which the Indians\r\ndeclare to be _agua de veruga_, would be very desirable.[57]\r\n\r\nIn the Quebrada of Canta, where the verugas are less common than in\r\nthat of Matucanas, another disease, called the Uta, is of very frequent\r\noccurrence. The uta is a sort of cancer, and it is more fearful in its\r\nconsequences than the verugas. Probably in no country in the world do\r\nso many local diseases prevail as in Peru. Every valley has its own\r\npeculiar disease, which frequently does not extend beyond the boundary\r\nof a few square miles, and is quite unknown in neighboring districts.\r\nThe origin of these disorders is, doubtless, to be traced to certain\r\nmineral or vegetable influences as yet unknown. It is remarkable how\r\nunequally these baneful visitations affect the different races of the\r\ninhabitants. The Indians and the lighter classes of half-castes are\r\nmost frequently attacked by the verugas; the whites are less liable to\r\nthe disease, whilst the negroes and people of the darker shades of\r\nmixed blood seldom suffer from it. The Indians and the Chinos are\r\nparticularly liable to the uta. The caracha, of which I have already\r\nspoken,[58] visits the Negroes, the Zamboes, and the Mulattoes; the\r\nlighter-complexioned races being much less liable to it.\r\n\r\nAt Quibe I saw a bird-catching spider (_mygale_), of extraordinary large\r\nsize. The back part of the body alone measured two inches. Being at some\r\ndistance I supposed it to be one of the rodent animals, and I fired at\r\nit. To my mortification I discovered my mistake when too late, for the\r\nspecimen was completely destroyed by the shot, and was useless for my\r\ncollection. The Indians assured me that on the margin of the stream\r\nwhich flowed near the plantation many larger individuals were to be\r\nfound; but I never saw another of such remarkable size as the one I\r\ninadvertently destroyed.\r\n\r\nSan Geronimo de Surco is 6945 feet above the level of the sea. It is a\r\nlong village, and is situated in one of the most fertile parts of the\r\nvalley. The houses are detached one from another, and each is\r\nsurrounded by a little chacra. This place may be regarded as the\r\nboundary-line between the coast and the Sierra. The climate is\r\nagreeable--rather hot than cold. Most of the coast plants thrive here\r\nwith little culture. Bananas, chirimoyas, superb granadillas,\r\npomegranates, camotes, &c., grow here in luxuriant abundance. Yuccas I\r\ndid not see: their elevation boundary is lower. San Geronimo de Surco\r\nis infested with swarms of annoying insects, especially sancudos\r\n(_Culex molestus_, Kell.), and stinging flies (species of _Simoleum_),\r\nwhich banish sleep from the resting-place of the weary traveller.\r\n\r\nIn this village there is an old Spaniard who keeps a tambo, and at the\r\nsame time exercises the calling of a farrier. One of my horse's shoes\r\nbeing loose, I got him to fasten it on. For hammering in eight nails he\r\nmade me pay half a gold ounce, and at first he demanded twelve dollars.\r\nHe doubtless bore in mind the old Spanish proverb: \"_Por un clavo se\r\npierde una herradura, por una herradura un cavallo, por un cavallo un\r\ncavallero_,\"[59] and he felt assured that I must have the damage repaired\r\nat any price. Shortly after my arrival in the Sierra I got myself\r\ninitiated in the art of horse-shoeing, and constantly carried about with\r\nme a supply of horse-shoes and nails, a plan which I found was generally\r\nadopted by travellers in those parts. It is only in the larger Indian\r\nvillages that farriers are to be met with, that is to say in places\r\nfifty or sixty leagues distant from each other.\r\n\r\nFrom Surco the road runs to the distance of two leagues tolerably\r\nlevel, and very close to the river, which, from Cocachacra, bears the\r\nname of Rio de San Mateo. The next village is San Juan de Matucanas, at\r\na little distance from which there is a tambo, situated at the height\r\nof 8105 feet above the sea.[60] These tambos of the Sierra are wretched\r\nplaces, but the traveller may find in them shelter, and possibly some\r\nmiserable kind of food. Even in Lima the tambos are not much better. In\r\nthe capital a tambo affords the traveller the accommodation of a room,\r\ncontaining a table, a chair, and a bedstead; for it is always\r\nunderstood that he brings his mattress and bedding along with him. In\r\nthe interior of the country the accommodation is limited to an empty\r\nspace on the floor, just large enough to spread a mattress upon.\r\nWhenever the state of the weather permitted I always preferred sleeping\r\nin the open air. Even on a rainy night a lodging on the outside of the\r\ndoor is preferable to the interior of the hut, where Indians, negroes,\r\ndogs and pigs are all huddled together. In these tambos there is\r\nseldom any scarcity of brandy or chicha; but the hungry traveller\r\nsometimes cannot get even a potatoe or a bit of maize. Frequently, when\r\nthe Indians really have provisions they will not produce them, because\r\nthey are fearful of not being paid. This suspicion is pardonable\r\nenough; for when troops march through the villages the inhabitants are\r\noften cheated by the officers, and ill-treated into the bargain.\r\nGenerally, in this part of the country, the people are civil, and will\r\nreadily sell provisions if they are paid. Not so the Indians of the\r\nhigher mountains eastward of the Cordillera. To the traveller's demand\r\nfor something to eat, their uniform reply is \"_Manam canchu_\" (we have\r\nnothing); and it is often found necessary to resort to force in order\r\nto convert this monotonous answer into the more agreeable \"_Ari\r\nconchu_\" (here is something).\r\n\r\nMatucanas, which is rather a large village, lies on the left bank of the\r\nRimac. The houses are of brick, and roofed with straw. The soil round\r\nthis village is fertile, though not favorable to the growth of those\r\nplants which demand a very warm temperature. The agricultural produce is\r\ntherefore limited to maize, wheat, lucerne (which is very abundant), and\r\npotatoes; the latter are sent in great quantities to the capital. The\r\ncactus grows on the hills, and its excellent fruit (_tunas_) forms also\r\nan article of trade.\r\n\r\nBeyond Matucanas the valley contracts into a narrow ravine no broader\r\nthan the bed of the river, and it gradually assumes a wilder character.\r\nThe way is difficult along the ridge of hills which borders the left\r\nbank of the river. The vegetation is less monotonous and scanty than in\r\nthe valleys of the coast, and all the fissures of the hills are filled\r\nwith verdure. The stunted willow (_Salix Humboldtii_, Wild.) grows along\r\nthe banks of the river, and on the less steep declivities is seen the\r\nred thorn-apple (_Datura sanguinea_, R. Pav.). To the latter the natives\r\ngive the names _Huacacachu_, _Yerba de Huaca_, or _Bovachevo_; and they\r\nprepare from its fruit a very powerful narcotic drink, called _tonga_.\r\nThe Indians believe that by drinking the tonga they are brought into\r\ncommunication with the spirits of their forefathers. I once had an\r\nopportunity of observing an Indian under the influence of this drink.\r\nShortly after having swallowed the beverage he fell into a heavy stupor:\r\nhe sat with his eyes vacantly fixed on the ground, his mouth\r\nconvulsively closed, and his nostrils dilated. In the course of about a\r\nquarter of an hour his eyes began to roll, foam issued from his\r\nhalf-opened lips, and his whole body was agitated by frightful\r\nconvulsions. These violent symptoms having subsided, a profound sleep of\r\nseveral hours succeeded. In the evening I again saw this Indian. He was\r\nrelating to a circle of attentive listeners the particulars of his\r\nvision, during which he alleged he had held communication with the\r\nspirits of his forefathers. He appeared very weak and exhausted.\r\n\r\nIn former times the Indian sorcerers, when they pretended to transport\r\nthemselves into the presence of their deities, drank the juice of the\r\nthorn-apple, in order to work themselves into a state of ecstasy. Though\r\nthe establishment of Christianity has weaned the Indians from their\r\nidolatry, yet it has not banished their old superstitions. They still\r\nbelieve that they can hold communications with the spirits of their\r\nancestors, and that they can obtain from them a clue to the treasures\r\nconcealed in the _huacas_, or graves; hence the Indian name of the\r\nthorn-apple--_huacacachu_, or grave plant.\r\n\r\nA few miles beyond Matucanas there is a lateral valley, larger and more\r\npleasant than the principal valley. It is called the Quebrada de Viso,\r\nand is watered by a little stream. At the point where this Quebrada\r\nforms a junction with the principal valley is situated the Tambo de\r\nViso. It is 9100 feet above the level of the sea.[61] At this tambo the\r\ntraveller may find a tolerable night's lodging for himself, and fodder\r\nfor his horse. Here the river is crossed by a bridge, and the road then\r\nproceeds along the left bank of the river, after having been on the\r\nright bank all the way from Lima. The bridges across these mountain\r\nstreams are always constructed at points where the river is most\r\ncontracted by the narrow confines of the ravine. They consist merely of\r\na few poles made of the trunk of the Maguay-tree (_Agave Americana_),\r\nand connected together by transverse ropes; the ropes being overlaid\r\nwith twisted branches and pieces of hoops. These bridges are not more\r\nthan three feet broad, and have no balustrades. When the space between\r\nthe banks of the river is too long for the Maguay stems, strong ropes\r\nmade of twisted ox-hides are substituted. In crossing these bridges\r\naccidents frequently happen, owing to the hoofs of the horses and mules\r\ngetting entangled in the plaited branches along the pathway. A little\r\nway beyond San Mateo I narrowly escaped being precipitated, with my\r\nmule, into the rocky chasm forming the bed of the river.\r\n\r\nThe road between Viso and San Mateo, a distance of about three\r\nleagues, is exceedingly difficult and dangerous. The ravine becomes\r\nnarrowed to a mere cleft, between walls of mountain rising on either\r\nside to the height of more than a thousand feet; sometimes\r\nperpendicularly, and at other times inclining inwards, so as to form\r\ngigantic arches. The path runs along the base of these mountains,\r\nwashed by the foaming waves of the stream; or it winds up the side of\r\nthe precipice, over huge fragments of rock, which, being loosened by\r\nthe rain, afford no secure footing for the heavily laden mules.\r\nFrequently these loosened blocks give way, and roll down into the\r\nvalley. The journey from Viso to San Mateo is associated in my mind\r\nwith the recollection of a most mortifying accident. A mass of rock,\r\nsuch as I have just described, gave way, and rolling down the\r\nprecipice, hurled one of my mules into the foaming abyss. My most\r\nvaluable instruments, a portion of my collections, my papers, and--to\r\nme an irreparable loss--a diary carefully and conscientiously kept for\r\nthe space of fourteen months, were in a moment buried in the river.\r\nTwo days afterward the current washed the dead mule ashore at\r\nMatucanas, but its load was irrecoverably lost.\r\n\r\nEvery year many beasts of burthen, and even travellers, perish on this\r\nroad. In the Tambo de Viso I met an officer who, with two of his sons,\r\nwas coming from the Sierra. He had placed the youngest before him, and\r\nthe other, a boy of ten years of age, was seated on the mule's\r\ncrupper. When they were within about half a league from Viso, a huge\r\nmass of rock, rolling down from the mountain, struck the elder boy,\r\nand hurled him into the river. The afflicted father was anxiously\r\nseeking to recover the body of his lost child.\r\n\r\nSan Mateo is on the right bank of the river, and is the largest\r\nvillage in this valley. It corresponds in situation with Culluay in\r\nthe Quebrada of Canta; as Matucanas corresponds with the village of\r\nObrajillo. San Mateo is 10,947 feet above the level of the sea.[62]\r\nThe soil produces abundance of potatoes, Ocas (_Oxalis tuberosa_) and\r\nUllucas (_Tropæolum tuberosum_). Maize ripens here perfectly, but the\r\nheads are small. The lucerne is also small, but very abundant; it is\r\nvery much exposed to injury from the frost, and is only good for use\r\nduring the five rainy months of the year. Five hundred feet higher,\r\nthat is to say, about 11,500 feet above the sea, is the boundary\r\nelevation for the growth of lucerne.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of hospitality, so generally prevalent among the Sierra\r\nIndians, does not seem to animate the Cholos of San Mateo. Their manners\r\nare rude and reserved, and they are very distrustful of strangers. As\r\nsoon as a traveller enters the village, the Alcade and the Rejidores\r\nmake their appearance, and demand his passport. If he cannot produce it,\r\nhe may possibly be put upon a donkey, and conducted to the nearest\r\nPrefect, or may moreover run the risk of being ill-treated. But,\r\nfortunately, it is easy to escape such annoyances. Any scrap of printed\r\nor written paper will answer for a passport, as it rarely happens that\r\neither the Alcade or the Rejidores can read. On one occasion when my\r\npassport was demanded, I discovered I had lost it. Fortunately, I had in\r\nmy pocket a bit of waste paper, which I had used instead of wadding in\r\nloading my gun. I ventured at all hazards to hand it to the Indian\r\nRejidor, who having unfolded it stared very gravely at the words _Lucia\r\ndi Lammermoor_, which he saw printed in large characters. It was the\r\nbill of the opera I had attended a few evenings before my departure from\r\nLima. After examining the bill very attentively, and then scanning me\r\nvery narrowly, the Rejidor returned the paper, with the observation that\r\nthe passport was quite correct.\r\n\r\nFrom San Mateo the road runs for half a league through a gloomy\r\nravine; and then suddenly takes a steep ascent up the side of the\r\nmountain, over fragments of stones, lying one above another like\r\nflights of steps. The stream dashes from rock to rock, covering the\r\nnarrow path with foam, and washing away the blocks of stone which, in\r\nsome of the most dangerous parts, serve as barriers along the edge of\r\nthe precipice. On this road long trains of mules are frequently met\r\ncoming from the Sierra. The traveller, at their approach, seeks some\r\nlittle recess into which he may creep, and there stand closely jammed\r\nagainst the mountain until the train passes by. This is attended by\r\ngreat loss of time, owing to the slow and cautious pace at which the\r\nmules proceed. On such a rencounter in a narrow mountain path, I was\r\nonce obliged to wait for several hours, whilst two hundred mules\r\npassed by; and at the spot where I and my horse stood, the laden\r\nanimals had scarcely space sufficient to set down their feet at the\r\nvery edge of the pathway. In some places it is perfectly impossible\r\neither to go on one side or to turn back; and when horses or mules\r\nmeet at these difficult points, one of the animals is obliged to\r\nplunge into the stream, before the other can have room to pass. The\r\nnumerous curvatures of the road, and the projecting masses of\r\nmountain, render it impossible to see advancing objects in sufficient\r\ntime to avoid collision.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed this difficult tract, which is called by the natives\r\nCacray, we reach the summit of the acclivity down which the mountain\r\nstream descends. Here the valley presents quite the Sierra character. It\r\nis no longer confined within steep and rugged mountain walls, but runs\r\nin undulating contours along the bases of the hills, and gently ascends\r\neastward towards the principal chain of the Cordillera. The road is\r\nsometimes on the right and sometimes on the left bank of the river. Two\r\nleagues beyond San Mateo lies Chicla, a miserable Indian village, which,\r\naccording to Maclean's calculation, is 12,712 feet above sea level. In\r\nsome of the more sheltered parts barley is planted; but it does not\r\nripen, and is merely used as fodder (_Alcazer_). Chicla is the last\r\nplace in this valley where the soil is in any degree capable of\r\ncultivation. Half a league further on, there are a few scattered Indian\r\nhuts, called the village of Acchahuari. One of these huts is a tambo,\r\nwhich can never be forgotten by any unfortunate traveller who may have\r\ntaken up his abode in it. Necessity several times compelled me to seek a\r\nnight's lodging in this horrible tambo; but I never could remain in it\r\ntill morning; and even amidst snow or rain I have been glad to get out,\r\nand take up my resting-place on the outside of the door. The hostess is\r\na dirty old Indian woman, assisted by her daughter; and the hut is\r\nfilthy beyond description. For supper, the old woman cooks a vile mess\r\ncalled _Chupe_, consisting of potatoes and water, mixed with Spanish\r\npepper; but it is so dirtily prepared, that nothing but the most deadly\r\nhunger would induce any one to taste it. The beds consist of sheep-skins\r\nspread on the damp floor; and one bedchamber serves for the hostess, her\r\ndaughter, her grandchildren, and the travellers; an immense woollen\r\ncounterpane or blanket being spread over the whole party. But woe to the\r\nunwary traveller who trusts himself in this dormitory! He soon finds\r\nhimself surrounded by enemies from whose attacks it is impossible to\r\nescape; for the hut is infested with vermin. Even should he withdraw\r\ninto a corner, and make a pillow of his saddle, the annoyance pursues\r\nhim. Add to all this a stifling smoke, and all sorts of mephitic\r\nexhalations, and troops of guinea-pigs who run about during the whole\r\nnight, and gambol over the faces and bodies of the sleepers,--and it may\r\nreadily be conceived how anxiously the traveller looks for the dawn of\r\nmorning, when he may escape from the horrors of this miserable tambo.\r\nAcchahuari is 13,056 feet above the sea level. The climate is very\r\nungenial. During the winter months, rain and snow fall without\r\nintermission; and even during the summer, heavy drifts of snow are not\r\nunfrequent. From April to July, the medium temperature during the night\r\nis 4° R.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Cacray the diminished atmospheric pressure begins to\r\nproduce an effect on coast horses which have not been accustomed to\r\ntravel in the Sierra. They are attacked with a malady called the _veta_,\r\nwhich shows itself by difficulty of breathing and trembling. The animals\r\nare frequently so overpowered that they are unable either to move or\r\nstand, and if they are not immediately unsaddled and allowed to rest\r\nthey perish. The arrieros consider bleeding a cure for this malady. They\r\nsometimes slit the horse's nostrils, a remedy which is probably\r\nefficacious, as it enables the animal to inhale the air freely. Chopped\r\ngarlic put into the nostrils is supposed to be a preventive of the veta.\r\nMules are less liable to the malady probably because they ascend the\r\nacclivities more slowly than horses. The disease does not attack the\r\nnative horses of the Sierra, for which reason they are better than the\r\ncoast horses for mountain travelling. Mules, however, are preferable to\r\neither. It is wonderful with what tact and penetration the mule chooses\r\nhis footing. When he doubts the firmness of the ground he passes his\r\nmuzzle over it, or turns up the loose parts with his hoof before he\r\nventures to step forward. When he finds himself getting into soft and\r\nmarshy ground he stands stock still, and refuses to obey either stirrup\r\nor whip. If by accident he sinks into a morass, he makes a halt, and\r\nwaits very contentedly until he receives assistance. But in spite of all\r\nthis sagacity the traveller will not do well to resign himself wholly to\r\nthe guidance of his mule. In ordinary cases these animals allow\r\nthemselves to be guided, and sometimes they appear to think it more safe\r\nto trust to the bridle than to themselves. One of my mules frequently\r\ngave me curious proofs of this sort of calculation. When, in very\r\ndifficult parts of the road, I dismounted, in order to walk and lead him\r\nby the bridle, I found it impossible to get the animal to move either by\r\nforce or persuasion. He spread out his legs, fixed his hoofs firmly into\r\nthe ground, and obstinately resisted all my endeavors to make him move.\r\nBut as soon as I remounted he willingly obeyed every movement of the\r\nbridle. With this mule I could ride through marshes, which I could never\r\ndo with any other. He appeared to reflect that, as I only dismounted\r\nwhen the road was unsafe, his life was in no less danger than mine.\r\n\r\nAbout a league beyond Acchahuari the valley is bounded by the\r\nprincipal chain of the Cordillera. The ascent may be gained by two\r\ndifferent roads. One, the steeper of the two, runs southward, across\r\nthe Piedra Parada; the other, on which the ascent is somewhat easier,\r\ntakes an easterly direction, over Antarangra. We will first trace the\r\nlatter course, which is the most frequented. At the extremity of the\r\nvalley, and twenty-eight leagues from the capital, is situated the\r\nlast village, Cashapalca, 13,236 feet above the sea. Its inhabitants\r\nare chiefly employed in mining. Formerly, vast quantities of silver\r\nwere obtained here. But most of the mines are now either under water\r\nor exhausted, and the village, with its mine works, has dwindled into\r\ninsignificance. Beyond Cashapalca there is a tract of marshy ground,\r\nwhich being passed, a narrow winding road of about two leagues leads\r\nup the acclivity. The soil is clayey, and thinly bestrewed with alpine\r\ngrass, intermingled with syngenesious and cruciferous plants. Two\r\nplants which are called by the natives _mala yerba_ and _garban\r\nzillos_, and are a deadly poison to mules and horses, grow in great\r\nabundance here. The numerous skeletons of beasts of burthen seen along\r\nthe road bear evidence of the fatal effects of those plants. Higher up\r\nthe ascent the vegetation becomes more and more scanty, until at\r\nlength it entirely disappears, and nothing is visible but the barren\r\nrock of the Sierra highlands.\r\n\r\nThe last division of acclivity is called by the natives the Antarangra\r\n(copper rock). On it there is a small heap of stones, which I shall\r\ndescribe by and by, and a cross made of the stems of the _Baccharis_.\r\nFrom this point the traveller catches a distant glimpse of the\r\nheaven-towering summit of the Cordillera.\r\n\r\nI speedily mounted the ascent, and reached the goal of my journey.\r\nHere I found myself disappointed in the expectation I had formed of\r\ncommanding an uninterrupted view over boundless space and distance.\r\nThe prospect is greatly circumscribed by numerous rocky elevations,\r\nwhich spring up in every direction. The mountain passes running across\r\nthe ridge of the Cordillera are bounded on all sides by rocks,\r\nsometimes not very high, but at other times rising to the elevation of\r\n1000 feet. The pass of Antarangra (also called Portachuelo del Tingo,\r\nor Pachachaca) is 15,600 above the sea.[63] Nevertheless it is, during\r\na great part of the year, free from snow. Scarcely a quarter of a\r\nleague further northward are the eternal glaciers, and they are\r\nseveral hundred feet lower than the Pass. That the Pass itself is not\r\npermanently covered with snow is a circumstance which may probably be\r\naccounted for by the direction of the atmospheric currents. The east\r\nwinds penetrate into the deep recesses of the valleys, which are\r\nsheltered against the cold south wind by the adjacent mountain ridge.\r\nThe passes have a gloomy character, and the rugged grandeur of the\r\nsurrounding country presents an aspect of chaotic wildness and\r\ndisorder. The ground is covered with huge masses of rock; and the\r\nungenial fruitless soil is shunned alike by plants and animals. The\r\nthin tendrils of a lichen, here and there twining on a damp mass of\r\nstone, are the only traces of life. Yet the remains of human industry\r\nand activity are everywhere observable. On all sides are seen the deep\r\ncavities which formed the entrances to the now exhausted mines. These\r\ncavities are sometimes situated at elevated points of the almost\r\ninaccessible walls of rock, and are occasionally found in the level\r\npart of the valley, and close on the roadway. Instances have occurred\r\nof travellers being killed by falling into these holes, when they have\r\nbeen covered by thick falls of snow.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, on the Pass of Antarangra, the partition of\r\nthe waters flowing into the two great oceans, the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific. Scarcely thirty paces distant from each other there are two\r\nsmall lagunas. That situated most to the west is one of the sources of\r\nthe Rio de San Mateo, which, under the name of the Rimac, falls into the\r\nPacific. The other laguna, that to the eastward, sends its waters\r\nthrough a succession of small mountain lakes into the Rio de Pachachaca,\r\na small tributary to the mighty Amazon river. It is amusing to take a\r\ncup of water from the one laguna and pour it into the other. I could not\r\nresist indulging this whim; and in so doing I thought I might possibly\r\nhave sent into the Pacific some drops of the water destined for the\r\nAtlantic. But the whim, puerile as it may be, nevertheless suggests\r\nserious reflections on the mighty power of nature, which has thrown up\r\nthese stupendous mountains from the bosom of the earth; and also on the\r\ntestaceous animals found on these heights, memorials of the time when\r\nthe ocean flowed over their lofty summits.\r\n\r\nFrom the ridge the road runs eastward along a branch of the principal\r\nmountain chain. This branch forms the southern boundary of a\r\ngently-sloping valley. The declivity is terrace-formed, and on each\r\nterrace there is a small clear lake. This series of lakes is called\r\n_Huascacocha_ (the chain of lakes). In their waters, as in most of the\r\nmountain rivers, there is found in great numbers a small species of\r\nshad-fish (_Pygidium dispar_, Tsch.). They are caught during the night\r\nin nets, or by lines, to which the bait is fastened by small\r\ncactus-thorns.\r\n\r\nThe third in the series of the lagunas is called _Morococha_ (the\r\ncolored lake). On its banks some buildings have been constructed, for\r\nthe smelting of copper ore. The mines which yield this metal are on the\r\nsouthern declivity, close to the road leading down from the Cordillera.\r\nFormerly these mines were worked for silver, but were not found very\r\nproductive of that metal. Now they are again actively worked, and copper\r\nis obtained from them. The working of the Peruvian copper mines has\r\nhitherto been much neglected, though copper ore is exceedingly abundant.\r\n\r\nThe road from Morococha to Pachachaca is very uniform. The latter\r\nvillage, which is situated 12,240 feet above the level of the sea, was\r\nformerly a place of much greater importance than it now is. In its\r\nneighborhood there are a number of spacious buildings constructed at\r\nthe time of the unfortunate English mining speculation. Most of them\r\nare only half finished. At the entrance of the village there is a\r\nlarge hacienda. In some of the apartments the flooring is of wood; a\r\nthing seldom seen in these parts, where the wood for such purposes\r\nmust be brought from the eastern declivity of the Andes: the\r\ndifficulty and expense attending this transport are so considerable,\r\nthat a wooden floor is a great rarity in the habitations of the\r\nCordillera. A mine belonging to the hacienda is situated five leagues\r\nnorth-west of Pachachaca, and yields rich silver ore; but a great\r\npart of it is at present under water, and its drainage would be a very\r\ndifficult undertaking.\r\n\r\nReturning to the point where the two roads across the Cordillera\r\nseparate at Cashapalca, we will now trace the route by way of Piedra\r\nParada. This way is shorter than that by Antarangra, but the ascents\r\nare much steeper. The first objects met with by the traveller on this\r\nroad are some Indian huts, called _yauliyacu_, and the ruined hacienda\r\nof San Rafael. These being passed, the ascent continues over broken\r\nmasses of rock. About 15,200 feet above the sea there is a huge block\r\nof mountain, called the Piedra Parada, close against which a chapel\r\nwas formerly erected; the mountain forming the back wall of the\r\nstructure. Now there is merely an iron cross, fixed on the upper part\r\nof the block of mountain. On this spot the Archbishop used formerly to\r\ncelebrate mass, when he was on his rounds through the diocese. The\r\nchapel was destroyed by lightning, and has not been rebuilt. The pass\r\nof the Piedra Parada is 16,008 feet above the sea, and is always\r\ncovered with snow. Travellers frequently lose their way in this pass,\r\nan accident which befel me in March, 1842, when I was proceeding alone\r\nby that route. Being overtaken by a violent fall of snow, I could\r\nscarcely see a few paces before me. After wandering about for several\r\nhours, my horse became weary, and I began to despair of extricating\r\nmyself from the dreary plains of snow. Late in the evening I reached a\r\nlittle valley, where, sheltered by some rocks, I passed the night. On\r\nthe following morning I renewed my journey, and after considerable\r\nexertion I arrived at an Indian hut, where I obtained such directions\r\nas enabled me to recover the right course.\r\n\r\nThe eastern declivity of the Pass of Piedra Parada is steeper than that\r\nof Huascacocha. After a difficult ride of about two leagues, we reach\r\nfirst the valley, and then the village of Yauli. The village lies at the\r\nheight of 13,100 feet above the sea, and consists of about one hundred\r\nand fifty miserable huts, affording habitations for between twelve and\r\nfourteen thousand Indians, most of whom are employed in mining.\r\n\r\nThe Cordillera, in the neighborhood of Yauli, is exceedingly rich in\r\nlead ore, containing silver. Within the circuit of a few miles, above\r\neight hundred shafts have been made, but they have not been found\r\nsufficiently productive to encourage extensive mining works. The\r\ndifficulties which impede mine-working in these parts are caused\r\nchiefly by the dearness of labor and the scarcity of fuel. There being\r\na total want of wood, the only fuel that can be obtained consists of\r\nthe dried dung of sheep, llamas, and huanacus. This fuel is called\r\n_taquia_. It produces a very brisk and intense flame, and most of the\r\nmine-owners prefer it to coal. The process of smelting, as practised\r\nby the Indians, though extremely rude and imperfect, is nevertheless\r\nadapted to local circumstances. All European attempts to improve the\r\nsystem of smelting in these districts have either totally failed, or\r\nin their results have proved less effective than the simple Indian\r\nmethod. Complicated furnaces made after European models are\r\nexceedingly expensive, whilst the natives can construct theirs at the\r\ncost of fifty or sixty dollars each. These Indian furnaces can,\r\nmoreover, be easily erected in the vicinity of the mines, and when the\r\nmetal is not very abundant the furnaces may be abandoned without any\r\ngreat sacrifice. For the price of one European furnace the Indians may\r\nbuild more than a dozen, in each of which, notwithstanding the paucity\r\nof fuel, a considerably greater quantity of metal may be smelted than\r\nin one of European construction.\r\n\r\nAbout half a league beyond Yauli there are upwards of twenty mineral\r\nsprings, all situated within a circuit of a quarter of a mile. Several\r\nof them contain saline properties. One is called the _Hervidero_ (the\r\nwhirlpool). It is in the form of a funnel, and at its upper part is\r\nbetween ten and twelve feet diameter. Its surface is covered with\r\nfoam. The temperature of the water is only 7° C. higher than the\r\natmosphere. Some of these springs are tepid and sulphuric; and the\r\ntemperature of one of them is as high as 89° C. Near some of the\r\nsprings quadrangular basins have been constructed for baths, which are\r\nsaid to be very efficacious in cutaneous and rheumatic complaints. The\r\nclimate of Yauli is exceedingly rigorous. In summer the medium\r\ntemperature of the night is 8° C., but the days are mild. In winter,\r\non the other hand, the night is +1° C., and the day scarcely +3° C.,\r\nas the sky is continually overhung with thick clouds, which disperse\r\nthemselves in continual falls of snow. I passed several weeks in Yauli\r\nand in the wild country around it, and during that time I made many\r\nvaluable additions to my natural history collection.\r\n\r\nThe distance between Yauli and Pachachaca is two leagues. The road\r\ndescends gently along the right bank of the Rio de Yauli, which forms\r\nthe principal source of the Rio de Oroya. In this direction, as well as\r\nin other parts adjacent to Yauli, there are numerous remains of mining\r\nworks, formerly the property of Portuguese. These works were destroyed\r\nat the time of the persecution of the Portuguese in Peru, when the\r\nconsul, Juan Bautista, was hanged by the Inquisition, in Lima. Over\r\nthose events there hangs a veil of mystery, which will probably never be\r\nremoved. The Portuguese were the most powerful and intelligent\r\nmine-owners in Peru, and their prosperity excited the envy of the\r\nSpanish viceroy. A number of Portuguese emigrants, who came from\r\nBrazil, to settle in the Peruvian province of Maynas, furnished the\r\nviceroy with a ground of complaint, real or pretended. He set forth\r\nthat the Portuguese of the eastern parts of South America intended to\r\nmake themselves masters of Peru, and conjointly with the Inquisition\r\nhe commenced coercive measures against them. Their consul was accused\r\nof heresy, condemned and hanged, and the emigrants were pursued and\r\nput to death. Some of them escaped into the forests, where they were\r\nmassacred by the Indians, and only a very few succeeded in getting\r\nback to Brazil. Many of the wealthy Portuguese mine-owners, seeing the\r\ndanger that threatened them, sank their vast treasures in lakes, or\r\nburied them in retired places in the plains. These treasures consisted\r\nchiefly of smelted ore and silver coin, and only a very small portion\r\nwas afterwards discovered. Thus were these active and intelligent\r\nmine-owners sacrificed, either to a chimerical and unfounded\r\nsuspicion, or to a feeling of avarice, which, after all, failed in\r\nattaining its object. The consequences were disastrous to the country.\r\nPeruvian mining has never recovered the prosperity which it enjoyed\r\nunder the management of the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nBetween Yauli and Pachachaca the way is difficult, and without an\r\naccurate knowledge of the route, the traveller is likely to lose his\r\nway, and may even incur the danger of sinking in the marshes which\r\nspread along the bank of the river. From Pachachaca a broad and gentle\r\nsloping valley conducts to La Oroya, a distance of about three leagues.\r\nIn the range of mountains forming the southern boundary of this valley,\r\nthe river winds its way through deep ravines. About half a league from\r\nPachachaca there is a ford where the road divides; one division passing\r\nover the steep mountains of Yanaclara to Jauja, and the other running\r\ninto the wild valleys of Huayhuay. Midway between Pachachaca and La\r\nOroya there is a small, miserable Indian village called Saco, which is\r\nseldom visited by travellers, as it is difficult to procure in it the\r\ncommonest necessaries of food. In this place there is a natural bridge\r\nacross the river, which has worked out a bed for itself beneath the\r\nrocks. At several points along the course of this river I observed\r\nsimilar bridges of rock, but this one only is passable for horses.\r\n\r\nLa Oroya lies on the left bank of the river of that name, and\r\ncommunicates with the right bank by means of a large hanging bridge\r\n(Puente de Soga). These bridges are composed of four ropes (sogas) made\r\nof twisted cow-hide, and about the thickness of a man's arm. The four\r\nropes are connected together by thinner ones of the same material,\r\nfastened over them transversely. The whole is covered with branches,\r\nstraw, and roots of the Agave tree. On either side, a rope rather more\r\nthan two feet above the bridge serves as a balustrade. The sogas are\r\nfastened on each bank of the river by piles, or riveted into the rock.\r\nDuring the long continuous rains these bridges become loose and require\r\nto be tightened; but they are always lower in the middle than at the\r\nends, and when passengers are crossing them they swing like hammocks. It\r\nrequires some practice, and a very steady head, to go over the soga\r\nbridges unaccompanied by a Puentero.[64] However strongly made, they are\r\nnot durable; for the changeableness of the weather quickly rots the\r\nropes, which are made of untanned leather. They frequently require\r\nrepairing, and travellers have sometimes no alternative but to wait for\r\nseveral days until a bridge is passable, or to make a circuit of 20 or\r\n30 leagues. The Puente de Soga of Oroya is fifty yards long, and one and\r\na half broad. It is one of the largest in Peru; but the bridge across\r\nthe Apurimac, in the province of Ayacucho, is nearly twice as long, and\r\nit is carried over a much deeper gulf.\r\n\r\nAnother curious kind of bridge is that called the Huaro. It consists\r\nof a thick rope extending over a river or across a rocky chasm. To\r\nthis rope are affixed a roller, and a strong piece of wood formed\r\nlike a yoke, and by means of two smaller ropes, this yoke is drawn\r\nalong the thick rope which forms the bridge. The passenger who has to\r\ncross the Huaro is tied to the yoke, and grasps it firmly with both\r\nhands. His feet, which are crossed one over the other, rest on the\r\nthick rope, and the head is held as erectly as possible. All these\r\npreliminaries being completed, an Indian, stationed on the opposite\r\nside of the river or chasm, draws the passenger across the Huaro. This\r\nis altogether the most disagreeable and dangerous mode of conveyance\r\nthat can possibly be conceived. If the rope breaks, an accident of no\r\nunfrequent occurrence, the hapless traveller has no chance of escaping\r\nwith life, for being fastened, he can make no effort to save himself.\r\nHorses and mules are driven by the Indians into the river, and are\r\nmade to swim across it, in doing which they frequently perish,\r\nespecially when being exhausted by a long journey, they have not\r\nstrength to contend against the force of the current.\r\n\r\nThe village of Oroya, about a quarter of a mile from the bridge, is\r\nbuilt on a declivity, and according to Maclean's calculation is 12,010\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. It contains fifty-one miserable huts,\r\nwhich are the habitations of about two hundred Indians. From Oroya\r\nseveral roads branch off into the different mountain districts. The most\r\nfrequented is that over the level height of Cachi-Cachi to Jauja. Along\r\nthis road there are extensive tracts of ground covered with calcareous\r\npetrifactions. Another road leading to Tarma passes by the ancient Inca\r\nfortress Huichay. A third, and much frequented road is that by way of\r\nHuaypacha, and from thence to Junin and Cerro de Pasco.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: All these calculations are by English feet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Jardine and Selby's Annals of Natural History.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Nivelacion barometrica desde el Callao hasta Pasco, por el\r\ncamino de Obrajillo, y desde el mismo lugar hasta la capital por via de\r\nTarma, hecha y calculada por Mariano Eduardo Rivero y Usturitz in\r\nMemorial de Ciencias naturales, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Darwin's Journal, p. 350]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: The Spaniards term this plant _Uña de gato_ (Cat's-claw),\r\nthe stalk being furnished with hooked thorns resembling claws.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: For further information relative to this disease, see my\r\ncommunication to Wunderlich and Roser's \"_Archiv für Physiologische\r\nHeilkunde_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: See page 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: By a nail is lost a shoe, by a shoe a horse, and by a\r\nhorse a rider.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: According to Maclean, the elevation of Matucanas is 8026\r\nfeet above the level of the sea.

The chain nearest the coast\r\nof the Pacific is at the average distance of from sixty to seventy\r\nEnglish miles from the sea. The other chain takes a parallel direction\r\nbut describes throughout its whole course a slight curve eastward. These\r\ntwo ranges of mountain are called the Cordilleras, or the Andes: both\r\nterms being used indiscriminately. Even the creoles of Peru confound\r\nthese two terms, sometimes calling the western chain by one name, and\r\nsometimes by the other. Nevertheless, a strict distinction ought to be\r\nobserved:--the western chain should properly be called the Cordillera,\r\nand the eastern chain the Andes. The latter name is derived from the\r\nQuichua word Antasuyu; _Anta_ signifying metal generally, but especially\r\ncopper, and _Suyu_ a district; the meaning of Antasuyu, therefore, is\r\nthe metal district. In common parlance, the word Suyu was dropped, and\r\nthe termination _a_ in _Anta_ was converted into _is_. Hence the word\r\n_Antis_, which is employed by all old writers and geographers; and even\r\nnow is in common use among the Indian population of Southern Peru. The\r\nSpaniards, according to their practice of corrupting the words of the\r\nQuichua language, have transformed Antis into _Andes_, and they apply\r\nthe name without distinction to the western and the eastern chain of\r\nmountains.[65]\r\n\r\nThe old inhabitants of Peru dwelt chiefly along the base of the eastern\r\nmountain chain, where they drew from the mines the metal which afforded\r\nmaterial for their tasteful and ingenious workmanship: those mountains\r\nconsequently retained the name of Antis or Andes. In the time of the\r\nIncas, both chains were called Ritisuyu (Snow-Districts). The Spaniards,\r\non the invasion of the country, advancing from the sea-coast, first\r\narrived at the western mountains, and to them they gave the name of\r\n_Cordillera_, the term commonly employed in the Spanish language, to\r\ndesignate any mountain chain. Most of the earlier travellers and\r\ntopographists named the western chain the _Cordillera de los Andes_, and\r\nregarded it as the principal chain, of which they considered the eastern\r\nmountains to be merely a branch. To the eastern range of mountains they\r\ngave the name of _Cordillera Oriental_. I will here strictly observe the\r\ncorrect denominations, calling the western chain the Cordillera, or the\r\ncoast mountains; and the eastern chain the Andes, or the inner\r\nCordillera.\r\n\r\nThese two great mountain chains stand in respect to height in an inverse\r\nrelation one to the other; that is to say, the greater the elevation of\r\nthe Cordillera, the more considerable is the depression of the Andes. In\r\nSouth Peru the ridge of the Cordillera is considerably lower than that\r\nportion of the Andes which stretches through Bolivia. The medium height\r\nof the Cordillera in South Peru is 15,000 feet above the sea; but here\r\nand there particular points rise to a much more considerable elevation.\r\nThe medium height of the Andes is 17,000 feet above the sea. In central\r\nPeru the Cordillera is higher than the Andes. There the altitude of the\r\nlatter along the body of the chain is 13,000 feet above the sea: on the\r\nridge there are a few points some hundred feet higher. Between Pasco\r\nand Loxas the average height of the Cordillera is between 11,000 and\r\n12,000 feet above the sea; and the average elevation of the Andes at the\r\ncorresponding point is about 2000 feet lower.\r\n\r\nThe passes do not run through valleys, but always over the ridges of the\r\nmountains. The highest mountain passes are the Rinconada (16,452 feet\r\nabove the sea); the Piedra Parada (16,008 feet); the Tingo (15,600\r\nfeet); the Huatillas (14,850 feet); the Portachuelo de la Viuda (14,544\r\nfeet); the Altos de Toledo (15,530 feet); and the Altos de los Huesos\r\n(14,300 feet). In both chains there are innumerable small lakes; these\r\nare met with in all the mountain passes, and most of them are the\r\nsources of small rivers.\r\n\r\nBoth the mountain chains, as well as their lateral branches, are rich in\r\nmetallic produce; but in the principal mountains gold is rare. Some rich\r\nmines on the coast, and in the province of Arequipa, are now nearly\r\nexhausted. Wash gold is plentiful in the rivers of North Peru, but it is\r\nnot carefully collected. Silver, which constitutes the principal wealth\r\nof Peru, is found in greatest abundance in the principal chains, viz.,\r\nin Northern and Central Peru, in the Cordillera; and in Southern Peru in\r\nthe Andes. It presents itself in all forms and combinations, from the\r\npure metal to the lead-ore mixed with silver. Even in the highest\r\nelevations, in parts scarcely trodden by human footsteps, rich veins of\r\nsilver are discovered. It is scarcely possible to pass half a day in\r\nthese regions without encountering new streaks. Quicksilver is likewise\r\nfound, but in such small quantities, that the gain does not pay the\r\nlabor of the miners. The only quicksilver vein of any magnitude is at\r\nHuancavelica. Both mountain chains are very rich in copper-ore; but it\r\nis extracted only from the Cordillera, for the distance of the Andes\r\nfrom the coast renders the transport too expensive. The lead and iron\r\nmines, though amazingly prolific, are not worked; the price of the metal\r\nbeing too low to pay the labor.\r\n\r\nThe Cordillera presents an aspect totally different from that of the\r\nAndes. It is more wild and rugged, its ridge is broader, and its summits\r\nless pyramidical. The summits of the Andes terminate in slender sharp\r\npoints like needles. The Cordillera descends in terraces to the level\r\nheights, whilst the slope of the Andes is uniform and unbroken. The\r\nsummits of the calcareous hills which stretch eastward from the great\r\nchain of the Cordillera are broken and rugged. Large cubical blocks of\r\nstone become detached from them, and roll down into the valleys. In the\r\nQuebrada of Huari near Yanaclara, which is 13,000 feet above the sea, I\r\ncollected among other fragments of rock some of a species which is found\r\nat Neufchatel in Switzerland. This disintegration, which is the effect\r\nof protracted rain and cold, imparts to the mountain ridges the most\r\nsingular and beautiful forms; their fantastic outlines appearing like\r\nthe work of human hands. Imagination may easily picture them to be\r\nmonuments of the time of the Incas; for viewed from a distance, they\r\nlook like groups of giants or colossal animals. In former times the\r\nIndians viewed these masses of rock with devout reverence, for they\r\nbelieved them to be the early inhabitants of the earth whom Pacchacamac\r\nin his anger transformed to stone. I may here notice some very curious\r\nforms of rock which have long been a subject of controversy among\r\nPeruvian travellers. On the road leading from Ayacucho to Huancavelica,\r\non the level height of Paucara, about a league beyond the village of\r\nParcos, there is a considerable number of sand-stone pyramids from eight\r\nto twenty-two feet high. They are of a reddish-white color; but in many\r\nplaces the inclemency of the weather has overspread them with a blackish\r\ncrust. They are detached one from another. Ulloa, in his _Noticias\r\nAmericanas_, after fully describing these pyramids, declares himself\r\ndoubtful whether they are the work of man or of nature. He inclines to\r\nregard them as human creations, and suggests that they may possibly have\r\nbeen the tombs of distinguished curacas and caciques; but he admits that\r\nhe is not acquainted with any similar monuments in Peru. As each pyramid\r\nconsists of only one block of stone, and all are very regularly shaped,\r\nUlloa is not indisposed to believe that the Indians possessed the secret\r\nart of melting stone. These blocks are, however, of sand-stone, and\r\ntheir fractures are the result of the inclemency of the weather. They\r\nare all pyramidal-shaped, and tolerably equal in size. In several of\r\nthem the points are as sharp and regular as though they had been wrought\r\nby the chisel of the sculptor. These curious pyramids cover the plateau\r\nalong a distance of more than two miles: sometimes standing closely\r\ntogether, and sometimes at considerable distances apart. The whole line\r\nof chalk and slate mountains extending from Ayacucho to Huancavelica is\r\nshattered, and presents similar, though less regular detritus.\r\n\r\nI have, in my last chapter, observed that the Cordillera is the point\r\nof partition between the waters of the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans.\r\nAll the waters of the eastern declivity of the Cordillera--all those\r\nwhich have their source on the level heights and on the western\r\ndeclivity of the Andes,--flow from thence in the direction of the east,\r\nand work their way through the eastern mountain chain. Throughout the\r\nwhole extent of South America there is not a single instance of the\r\nCordillera being intersected by a river; a fact the more remarkable\r\nbecause in Southern Peru and Bolivia, the coast chain is lower than the\r\nAndes. This interesting phenomenon, though it has deeply engaged the\r\nattention of geologists, has not yet been satisfactorily explained. I\r\nconcur in the view taken by Mr. Darwin, who observes that it would be\r\ntoo rash to assign to the eastern chain of Bolivia and Central Chile, a\r\nlater origin than the western chain (the nearest the Pacific), but that\r\nthe circumstance of the rivers of a lower mountain chain having forced\r\ntheir way through a higher chain seems, without this supposition, to be\r\nenigmatical. Mr. Darwin is of opinion that the phenomenon is assignable\r\nto a periodical and gradual elevation of the second mountain line (the\r\nAndes); for a chain of islets would at first appear, and as these were\r\nlifted up, the tides would be always wearing deeper and broader\r\nchannels between them.\r\n\r\nIn the heights of the Cordillera the effect of the diminished\r\natmospheric pressure on the human frame shows itself in intolerable\r\nsymptoms of weariness and an extreme difficulty of breathing. The\r\nnatives call this malady the _Puna_ or the _Soroche_; and the Spanish\r\nCreoles give it the names of _Mareo_ or _Veta_. Ignorant of its real\r\ncauses they ascribe it to the exhalations of metals, especially\r\nantimony, which is extensively used in the mining operations. The first\r\nsymptoms of the veta are usually felt at the elevation of 12,600 feet\r\nabove the sea. These symptoms are vertigo, dimness of sight and\r\nhearing, pains in the head and nausea. Blood flows from the eyes, nose,\r\nand lips. Fainting fits, spitting of blood, and other dangerous\r\nsymptoms, usually attend severe attacks of veta. The sensations which\r\naccompany this malady somewhat resemble those of sea-sickness, and hence\r\nits Spanish name _mareo_. But sea-sickness is unaccompanied by the\r\ndistressing difficulty of breathing experienced in the veta. This\r\ndisorder sometimes proves fatal, and I once witnessed a case in which\r\ndeath was the result. Inhabitants of the coast and Europeans, who for\r\nthe first time visit the lofty regions of the Cordillera, are usually\r\nattacked with this disorder. Persons in good health and of a spare habit\r\nspeedily recover from it, but on plethoric and stout individuals its\r\neffects are frequently very severe. After an abode of some time in the\r\nmountainous regions, the constitution becomes inured to the rarefied\r\natmosphere. I suffered only two attacks of the veta; but they were very\r\nsevere. The first was on one of the level heights; and the second on the\r\nmountain of Antaichahua. The first time I ascended the Cordillera I did\r\nnot experience the slightest illness, and I congratulated myself on\r\nhaving escaped the veta; but a year afterwards I had an attack of it,\r\nthough only of a few hours' duration. The veta is felt with great\r\nseverity in some districts of the Cordillera, whilst in others, where\r\nthe altitude is greater, the disorder is scarcely perceptible. Thus it\r\nwould seem that the malady is not caused by diminished atmospheric\r\npressure, but is dependent on some unknown climatic circumstances. The\r\ndistricts in which the veta prevails with greatest intensity are, for\r\nthe most part, rich in the production of metals, a circumstance which\r\nhas given rise to the idea that it is caused by metallic exhalations.\r\n\r\nI have already described the effect of the Puna climate on beasts of\r\nburthen. Its influence on some of the domestic animals is no less severe\r\nthan on the human race. To cats, it is very fatal, and at the elevation\r\nof 13,000 feet above the sea those animals cannot live. Numerous trials\r\nhave been made to rear them in the villages of the upper mountains, but\r\nwithout effect; for after a few days' abode in those regions, the\r\nanimals die in frightful convulsions; but when in this state they do not\r\nattempt to bite. I had two good opportunities of observing the disease\r\nat Yauli. Cats attacked in this way are called, by the natives,\r\n_azorochados_, and antimony is alleged to be the cause of the distemper.\r\nDogs are also liable to it, but it visits them less severely than cats,\r\nand with care they may be recovered.\r\n\r\nAnother scourge of the traveller in the Cordillera, is the disease\r\ncalled the _Surumpe_. It is a violent inflammation of the eyes, caused\r\nby the sudden reflection of the bright rays of the sun on the snow. By\r\nthe rarefied air and the cutting wind, the eyes, being kept in a\r\nconstant state of irritation, are thereby rendered very susceptible to\r\nthe effects of the glaring light. In these regions the sky is often\r\nfor a time completely overshadowed by snow clouds, and the greenish\r\nyellow of the plain is soon covered by a sheet of snow: then suddenly\r\nthe sun's rays burst through the breaking clouds, and the eyes,\r\nunprepared for the dazzling glare, are almost blinded. A sharp burning\r\npain is immediately felt, and it speedily increases to an intolerable\r\ndegree. The eyes become violently inflamed, and the lids swell and\r\nbleed. The pain of the surumpe is the most intense that can be\r\nimagined, and frequently brings on delirium. The sensation resembles\r\nthat which it may be imagined would be felt if cayenne pepper or\r\ngunpowder were rubbed into the eyes. Chronic inflammation, swelling of\r\nthe eyelids, dimness of sight, and even total blindness are the\r\nfrequent consequences of the surumpe. In the Cordillera, Indians are\r\noften seen sitting by the road-side shrieking in agony, and unable to\r\nproceed on their way. They are more liable to the disease than the\r\nCreoles, who, when travelling in the mountains, protect their eyes by\r\ngreen spectacles and veils.\r\n\r\nHeavy falls of snow in the Cordillera are usually accompanied by\r\nthunder and lightning. During five months of the year, from November to\r\nMarch, storms are of daily occurrence. They begin, with singular\r\nregularity, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and continue until\r\nfive or half-past five in the evening. After that time storms of\r\nthunder and lightning never occur; but the falls of snow sometimes\r\ncontinue till midnight. As evening approaches, cold mists are drifted\r\nfrom the mountain-tops down upon the plains; but they are dispersed by\r\nthe rays of the morning sun, which in a few hours melt the snow. The\r\nfurious tempests in these regions exceed any idea that can be formed\r\nof them, and can only be conceived by those who have witnessed them.\r\nSome of these mountain districts have acquired an ominous character for\r\nstorms; Antaichahua is one of the places to which this sort of fearful\r\ncelebrity belongs. For hours together flash follows flash, painting\r\nblood-red cataracts on the naked precipices. The forked lightning darts\r\nits zig-zag flashes on the mountain-tops, or, running along the ground,\r\nimprints deep furrows in its course; whilst the atmosphere quivers\r\namidst uninterrupted peals of thunder, repeated a thousandfold by the\r\nmountain echoes. The traveller, overtaken by these terrific storms,\r\ndismounts from his trembling horse, and takes refuge beneath the\r\nshelter of some overhanging rock.\r\n\r\nIn these sterile heights, Nature withholds her fostering influence\r\nalike from vegetable and animal life. The scantiest vegetation can\r\nscarcely draw nutriment from the ungenial soil, and animals shun the\r\ndreary and shelterless wilds. The condor alone finds itself in its\r\nnative element amidst these mountain deserts. On the inaccessible\r\nsummits of the Cordillera that bird builds its nest, and hatches its\r\nyoung in the months of April and May. Few animals have attained so\r\nuniversal a celebrity as the condor. That bird was known in Europe, at\r\na period when his native land was numbered among those fabulous\r\nregions which are regarded as the scenes of imaginary wonders. The\r\nmost extravagant accounts of the condor were written and read, and\r\ngeneral credence was granted to every story which travellers brought\r\nfrom the fairy land of gold and silver. It was only at the\r\ncommencement of the present century that Humboldt overthrew the\r\nextravagant notions that previously prevailed respecting the size,\r\nstrength, and habits of that extraordinary bird.\r\n\r\nThe full-grown condor measures, from the point of the beak to the end\r\nof the tail, from four feet ten inches to five feet; and from the tip\r\nof one wing to the other, from twelve to thirteen feet. This bird feeds\r\nchiefly on carrion: it is only when impelled by hunger that he seizes\r\nliving animals, and even then only the small and defenceless, such as\r\nthe young of sheep, vicuñas, and llamas. He cannot raise great weights\r\nwith his feet, which, however, he uses to aid the power of his beak.\r\nThe principal strength of the condor lies in his neck and in his feet;\r\nyet he cannot, when flying, carry a weight exceeding eight or ten\r\npounds. All accounts of sheep and calves being carried off by condors\r\nare mere exaggerations. This bird passes a great part of the day in\r\nsleep, and hovers in quest of prey chiefly in the morning and evening.\r\nWhilst soaring at a height beyond the reach of human eyes, the\r\nsharp-sighted condor discerns his prey on the level heights beneath\r\nhim, and darts down upon it with the swiftness of lightning. When a\r\nbait is laid, it is curious to observe the numbers of condors which\r\nassemble in a quarter of an hour, in a spot near which not one had been\r\npreviously visible. These birds possess the senses of sight and smell\r\nin a singularly powerful degree.\r\n\r\nSome old travellers, Ulloa among others, have affirmed that the plumage\r\nof the condor is invulnerable to a musket-ball. This absurdity is\r\nscarcely worthy of contradiction; but it is nevertheless true that the\r\nbird has a singular tenacity of life, and that it is seldom killed by\r\nfire-arms, unless when shot in some vital part. Its plumage,\r\nparticularly on the wings, is very strong and thick. The natives,\r\ntherefore, seldom attempt to shoot the condor: they usually catch him by\r\ntraps or by the laso, or kill him by stones flung from slings, or by the\r\n_Bolas_. A curious method of capturing the condor alive is practised in\r\nthe province of Abancay. A fresh cow-hide, with some fragments of flesh\r\nadhering to it, is spread out on one of the level heights, and an Indian\r\nprovided with ropes creeps beneath it, whilst some others station\r\nthemselves in ambush near the spot, ready to assist him. Presently a\r\ncondor, attracted by the smell of flesh, darts down upon the cow-hide,\r\nand then the Indian, who is concealed under it, seizes the bird by the\r\nlegs, and binds them fast in the skin, as if in a bag. The captured\r\ncondor flaps his wings, and makes ineffectual attempts to fly; but he is\r\nspeedily secured, and carried in triumph to the nearest village.\r\n\r\nThe Indians quote numerous instances of young children having been\r\nattacked by condors. That those birds are sometimes extremely fierce is\r\nvery certain. The following occurrence came within my own knowledge,\r\nwhilst I was in Lima. I had a condor, which, when he first came into my\r\npossession, was very young. To prevent his escape, as soon as he was\r\nable to fly, he was fastened by the leg to a chain, to which was\r\nattached a piece of iron of about six pounds weight. He had a large\r\ncourt to range in, and he dragged the piece of iron about after him all\r\nday. When he was a year and a half old he flew away, with the chain and\r\niron attached to his leg, and perched on the spire of the church of\r\nSanto Tomas, whence he was scared away by the carrion hawks. On\r\nalighting in the street, a Negro attempted to catch him for the purpose\r\nof bringing him home; upon which he seized the poor creature by the ear,\r\nand tore it completely off. He then attacked a child in the street (a\r\nnegro boy of three years old), threw him on the ground, and knocked him\r\non the head so severely with his beak, that the child died in\r\nconsequence of the injuries. I hoped to have brought this bird alive to\r\nEurope; but, after being at sea two months on our homeward voyage, he\r\ndied on board the ship in the latitude of Monte Video.\r\n\r\nBetween the Cordillera and the Andes, at the height of 12,000 feet\r\nabove the sea, there are vast tracts of uninhabited table-lands. These\r\nare called in the Quichua language the _Puna_; and the Spaniards give\r\nthem the name of the _Despoblado_ (the uninhabited). These table-lands\r\nform the upper mountain regions of the South American Highlands. They\r\nspread over the whole extent of Peru, from north-west to south-east, a\r\ndistance of 350 Spanish miles, continuing through Bolivia, and\r\ngradually running eastward into the Argentine Republic. With reference\r\nto geography and natural history, these table-lands present a curious\r\ncontrast to the _Llanos_ (plains) of South America, situated on the\r\nother side of the Andes to the north-east. Those boundless deserts,\r\nfull of organic life, are, like the Puna, among the most interesting\r\ncharacteristics of the New World.\r\n\r\nThe climate of these regions is not less rigorous than that of the high\r\nmountain ridges. Cold winds from the west and south-west, blow nearly\r\nall the year round from the ice-topped Cordillera; and for the space of\r\nfour months these winds are daily accompanied by thunder, lightning, and\r\nsnow-storms. The average state of the thermometer during the cold season\r\n(which is called summer, because it then seldom snows) is, during the\r\nnight, -5° R.; and at midday, +9° 7´ R. In winter the mercury seldom\r\nfalls during the night below freezing point, and it continues between\r\n+1° and 0° R.; but at noon it ascends only to 7° R. It is, however,\r\nquite impossible to determine with precision the medium temperature of\r\nthese regions. For the space of a few hours the heat will frequently\r\nvary between 18° and 20° R. The transition is the more sensibly felt on\r\nthe fall of the temperature, as it is usually accompanied by\r\nsharp-biting winds, so keen, that they cut the skin on the face and\r\nhands. A remarkable effect of the Puna wind is its power of speedily\r\ndrying animal bodies, and thereby preventing putridity. A dead mule is,\r\nin the course of a few days, converted into a mummy; not even the\r\nentrails presenting the least trace of decomposition.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that, after being long exposed to these cold\r\nwinds, the traveller enters warm atmospheric currents. These warm\r\nstreams are sometimes only two or three paces, and at other times,\r\nseveral hundred feet broad. They run in a parallel direction with each\r\nother, and one may pass through five or six of them in the course of a\r\nfew hours. On the level heights between Chacapalpa and Huancavelica, I\r\nremarked that they were especially frequent during the months of August\r\nand September. According to my repeated observations, I found that these\r\nwarm streams chiefly follow the direction of the Cordillera; namely,\r\nfrom S.S.W. to N.N.E. I once travelled the distance of several leagues\r\nthrough a succession of these currents of warm air, none of which\r\nexceeded seven-and-twenty paces in breadth. Their temperature was 11° R.\r\nhigher than that of the adjacent atmosphere. It would appear they are\r\nnot merely temporary, for the mule-drivers can often foretel with\r\ntolerable accuracy where they will be encountered. The causes of these\r\nphenomena well merit the investigation of meteorologists.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the Puna is singularly monotonous and dreary. The\r\nexpansive levels are scantily covered with grasses of a yellowish-brown\r\nhue, and are never enlivened by fresh-looking verdure. Here and there,\r\nat distant intervals, may be seen a few stunted Queñua trees\r\n(_Polylepis racemosa_, R. P.), or large patches of ground covered with\r\nthe Ratanhia shrub[66] (_Krameria triandria_, R. P.). Both are used by\r\nthe Indians as fuel, and for roofing their huts.\r\n\r\nThe cold climate and sterile soil of the Puna are formidable impediments\r\nto agriculture. Only one plant is cultivated in these regions with any\r\ndegree of success. It is the _maca_, a tuberous root grown like the\r\npotatoe, and like it used as an article of food. In many of the Puna\r\ndistricts the maca constitutes the principal sustenance of the\r\ninhabitants. It has an agreeable, and somewhat sweetish flavor, and when\r\nboiled in milk it tastes like the chestnut. As far as I am aware this\r\nplant has not been mentioned by any traveller, nor has its botanical\r\ncharacter yet been precisely determined. Possibly it is a species of\r\nTropæolum, but of this I am uncertain. The root is about the size of a\r\nlarge chestnut. Macas may be kept for more than a year, if, after being\r\ntaken from the earth, they are left a few days to dry in the sun, and\r\nthen exposed to the cold. By this means they become shrivelled and very\r\nhard. From these dried macas, the Indians prepare a sort of soup or\r\nrather syrup, which diffuses a sweet, sickly sort of odor, but which,\r\nwhen eaten with roasted maize, is not altogether unpalatable. The maca\r\nthrives best at the height of between 12,000 and 13,000 feet above the\r\nsea. In the lower districts it is not planted, for the Indians declare\r\nit to be flavorless when grown there. Besides the maca barley is reared\r\nin the Puna. I saw there fields of barley 13,200 feet above the sea. It\r\ndoes not, however, attain full maturity, seldom even shoots into ears,\r\nand is cut whilst green as fodder for horses.\r\n\r\nBut poor and scanty as is the vegetation of the Puna, the animal\r\nkingdom is there richly and beautifully represented. Those regions are\r\nthe native home of the great Mammalia, which Peru possessed before\r\nhorses and black cattle were introduced by the Spaniards. I allude to\r\nthe llama and his co-genera the alpaco, the huanacu, and the vicuña.\r\nOn these interesting animals I will subjoin a few observations.[67]\r\nThe two first are kept as domestic animals; the llama perfectly, and\r\nthe alpaco partially tame.\r\n\r\nThe llama measures from the sole of the hoof to the top of the head, 4\r\nfeet 6 to 8 inches; from the sole of the hoof to the shoulders, from 2\r\nfeet 11 inches to 3 feet. The female is usually smaller and less strong\r\nthan the male, but her wool is finer and better. The color is very\r\nvarious; generally brown, with shades of yellow or black; frequently\r\nspeckled, but very rarely quite white or black. The speckled brown llama\r\nis in some districts called the moromoro.\r\n\r\nThe young llamas are left with the dam for about the space of a year,\r\nafter which time they are removed and placed with flocks. When about\r\nfour years old, the males and females are separated; the former are\r\ntrained to carry burthens, and the latter are kept in the pastures of\r\nthe level heights. Most of the flocks of llamas are reared in the\r\nsouthern Puna provinces, viz.:--Cuzco and Ayacucho, and from thence\r\nthey are sent to the silver mines of North Peru. The price of a strong\r\nfull-grown llama is from three to four dollars; but if purchased in\r\nflocks in the provinces above named, they may be had for one and a\r\nhalf or two dollars each. Shortly after the conquest the price of one\r\nof these animals was between eighteen and twenty ducats; but the\r\nincrease of horses, mules, and sheep, lowered their value. The burthen\r\ncarried by the llama should not exceed one hundred and twenty-five\r\npounds, and the animal is seldom laden with more than a\r\nhundred-weight. When the llama finds his burthen too heavy he lies\r\ndown, and cannot be made to rise until some portion of the weight is\r\nremoved from his back. In the silver mines the llamas are of the most\r\nimportant utility, as they frequently carry the metal from the mines\r\nin places where the declivities are so steep that neither asses nor\r\nmules can keep their footing.\r\n\r\nThe Indians frequently proceed with large flocks of llamas to the coast,\r\nto procure salt. Their daily journeys are short, never exceeding three\r\nor four leagues; for the animals will not feed during the night, and\r\ntherefore they are allowed to graze as they go, or to halt for a few\r\nhours at feeding-time. When resting they make a peculiar humming noise,\r\nwhich, when proceeding from a numerous flock at a distance, is like a\r\nnumber of Æolian harps sounding in concert.\r\n\r\nA flock of laden llamas journeying over the table-lands is a beautiful\r\nsight. They proceed at a slow and measured pace, gazing eagerly around\r\non every side. When any strange object scares them, the flock\r\nseparates, and disperses in various directions, and the arrieros have\r\nno little difficulty in reassembling them. The Indians are very fond\r\nof these animals. They adorn them by tying bows of ribbon to their\r\nears, and hanging bells round their necks; and before loading, they\r\nalways fondle and caress them affectionately. If, during a journey,\r\none of the llamas is fatigued and lies down, the arriero kneels beside\r\nthe animal, and addresses to it the most coaxing and endearing\r\nexpressions. But notwithstanding all the care and attention bestowed\r\non them, many llamas perish on every journey to the coast, as they are\r\nnot able to bear the warm climate.\r\n\r\nSome old travellers have stated that the Indians employ the llama for\r\nriding and for draught; but these accounts are quite erroneous. It\r\nsometimes happens that when crossing a river an Indian lad, to avoid\r\ngetting wet, may mount on the back of one of the llamas; but in such a\r\ncase, he immediately dismounts on reaching the opposite bank. The flesh\r\nof the llama is spongy, and not agreeable in flavor. Its wool is used\r\nfor making coarse cloths.\r\n\r\nThe alpaco, or paco, is smaller than the llama. It measures from the\r\nlower part of the hoof to the top of the head only three feet three\r\ninches, and to the shoulders two feet and a half. In form it resembles\r\nthe sheep, but it has a longer neck and a more elegant head. The fleece\r\nof this animal is beautifully soft and very long; in some parts it is\r\nfour or five inches in length. Its color is usually either white or\r\nblack; but in some few instances it is speckled. The Indians make\r\nblankets and ponchos of the alpaco wool. It is also frequently exported\r\nto Europe, and it sells at a good price in England. The alpacos are kept\r\nin large flocks, and throughout the whole of the year they graze on the\r\nlevel heights. At shearing time only they are driven to the huts. They\r\nare in consequence very shy, and they run away at the approach of a\r\nstranger. The obstinacy of the alpaco is remarkable. When one of these\r\nanimals is separated from the flock, he throws himself on the ground,\r\nand neither force nor persuasion will induce him to rise;--sometimes\r\nsuffering the severest punishment rather than go the way the driver\r\nwishes. Few animals seem to require so imperatively the companionship of\r\nits own species, and it is only when brought to the Indian huts very\r\nyoung, that the alpacos can be separated from their flocks.\r\n\r\nThe largest animal of this family is the huanacu. It measures five feet\r\nfrom the bottom of the hoof to the top of the head, and three feet three\r\ninches to the shoulders. In form it so nearly resembles the llama, that\r\nuntil a very recent period, zoologists were of opinion that the llama\r\nwas an improved species of the huanacu, and that the latter was the\r\nllama in its wild state. In the \"Fauna Peruana\" I have explained the\r\nerroneousness of this opinion, and described the specific differences\r\nexisting between the two animals. On the neck, back, and thighs the\r\nhuanacu is of a uniform reddish-brown color. The under part of the body,\r\nthe middle line of the breast, and the inner side of the limbs are of a\r\ndingy white. The face is dark grey, and the lips of a clear white. Of\r\nthe huanacus there are not those varieties which are found among the\r\nllamas and the alpacos. The wool is shorter and coarser than that of the\r\nllama, and it is of nearly uniform length on all parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThe huanacus live in small herds of five or seven, seldom exceeding\r\nthe latter number. In some districts they are very shy, and retreat\r\nwhen any one approaches. If taken very young they may be tamed; but\r\nthey are always ready to fall back into their wild state. It is with\r\ngreat difficulty they can be trained as beasts of burthen. In the\r\nmenageries of Europe, huanacu brought from Chile are frequently\r\nrepresented to be llamas.\r\n\r\nThe vicuña is a more beautiful animal than any of those just\r\ndescribed. Its size is between that of the llama and the alpaco. It\r\nmeasures from the sole of the foot to the top of the head four feet\r\none inch, and two and a half feet to the shoulders. The neck is longer\r\nand more slender than in either of the other relative species; and\r\nfrom them the vicuña is also distinguished by the superior fineness of\r\nits short, curly wool. The crown of the head, the upper part of the\r\nneck, the back, and thighs, are of a peculiar reddish-yellow hue,\r\ncalled by the people of the country _color de vicuña_. The lower part\r\nof the neck, and the inner parts of the limbs, are of a bright ochre\r\ncolor, and the breast and lower part of the body are white.\r\n\r\nDuring the rainy season the vicuña inhabits the ridges of the\r\nCordillera, where some scanty vegetation is to be found. It never\r\nventures up to the naked rocky summits, for its hoofs being accustomed\r\nonly to turfy ground, are very soft and tender. It lives in herds,\r\nconsisting of from six to fifteen females, and one male, who is the\r\nprotector and leader of the herd. Whilst the females are quietly\r\ngrazing, the male stands at the distance of some paces apart, and\r\ncarefully keeps guard over them. At the approach of danger he gives a\r\nsignal, consisting of a sort of whistling sound, and a quick movement of\r\nthe foot. Immediately the herd draws closely together, each animal\r\nanxiously stretching out its head in the direction of the threatening\r\ndanger. They then take to flight; first moving leisurely and cautiously,\r\nand then quickening their pace to the utmost degree of speed; whilst the\r\nmale vicuña who covers the retreat frequently halts, to observe the\r\nmovements of the enemy. The females, with singular fidelity and\r\naffection, reward the watchful care of their protector. If he is wounded\r\nor killed, they gather round him in a circle, uttering their shrill\r\ntones of lamentation, and they will suffer themselves to be captured or\r\nkilled, rather than desert him by pursuing their flight. The neigh of\r\nthe vicuña, like that of the other animals of its class, resembles a\r\nshort, sharp whistle. But when the shrill sound vibrates through the\r\npure Puna air, the practised ear can readily distinguish the cry of the\r\nvicuña from that of the other animals of the same family.\r\n\r\nThe Indians seldom employ fire-arms in hunting the vicuñas. They catch\r\nthem by what they term the _chacu_. In this curious hunt, one man at\r\nleast belonging to each family in the Puna villages takes a part, and\r\nwomen accompany the train, to officiate as cooks to the hunters. The\r\nwhole company, frequently amounting to seventy or eighty individuals,\r\nproceeds to the Altos (the most secluded parts of the Puna), which are\r\nthe haunts of the vicuñas. They take with them stakes, and a great\r\nquantity of rope and cord. A spacious open plain is selected, and the\r\nstakes are driven into the ground in a circle, at intervals of from\r\ntwelve to fifteen feet apart, and are connected together by ropes\r\nfastened to them at the height of two or two and a half feet from the\r\nground. The circular space within the stakes is about half a league in\r\ncircumference, and an opening of about two hundred paces in width is\r\nleft for entrance. On the ropes by which the stakes are fastened\r\ntogether the women hang pieces of colored rags, which flutter about in\r\nthe wind. The chacu being fully prepared, the men, some of whom are\r\nmounted on horseback, range about within a circuit of several miles,\r\ndriving before them all the herds of vicuñas they meet with, and forcing\r\nthem into the chacu. When a sufficient number of vicuñas is collected,\r\nthe entrance is closed. The timid animals do not attempt to leap over\r\nthe ropes, being frightened by the fluttering rags suspended from them,\r\nand, when thus secured, the Indians easily kill them by the _bolas_.\r\nThese bolas consist of three balls, composed either of lead or stone;\r\ntwo of them heavy, and the third rather lighter. They are fastened to\r\nlong, elastic strings, made of twisted sinews of the vicuña, and the\r\nopposite ends of the strings are all tied together. The Indian holds the\r\nlightest of the three balls in his hand, and swings the two others in a\r\nwide circle above his head; then, taking his aim at the distance of\r\nabout fifteen or twenty paces, he lets go the hand-ball, upon which all\r\nthe three balls whirl in a circle, and twine round the object aimed at.\r\nThe aim is usually taken at the hind legs of the animals, and the cords\r\ntwisting round them, they become firmly bound. It requires great skill\r\nand long practice to throw the bolas dexterously, especially when on\r\nhorseback: a novice in the art incurs the risk of dangerously hurting\r\neither himself or his horse, by not giving the balls the proper swing,\r\nor by letting go the hand-ball too soon.\r\n\r\nThe vicuñas, after being secured by the bolas, are killed, and the flesh\r\nis distributed in equal portions among the hunters. The skins belong to\r\nthe Church. The price of a vicuña skin is four reals. When all the\r\nanimals are killed, the stakes, ropes, &c., are packed up carefully, and\r\nconveyed to another spot, some miles distant, where the chacu is again\r\nfixed up. The hunting is continued in this manner for the space of a\r\nweek. The number of animals killed during that interval varies according\r\nto circumstances, being sometimes fifty or sixty, and at other times\r\nseveral hundred. During five days I took part in a chacu hunt in the\r\nAltos of Huayhuay, and in that space of time 122 vicuñas were caught.\r\nWith the money obtained by the sale of the skins a new altar was erected\r\nin the church of the district. The flesh of the vicuña is more tender\r\nand better flavored than that of the llama. Fine cloth and hats are made\r\nof the wool. When taken young, the vicuñas are easily tamed, and become\r\nvery docile; but when old, they are intractable and malicious. At Tarma\r\nI possessed a large and very fine vicuña. It used to follow me like a\r\ndog whenever I went out, whether on foot or on horseback.\r\n\r\nThe frequent hunting seems not to have the effect of diminishing the\r\nnumbers of these animals. If in the vicinity of the villages where\r\nchacus are frequently established, they are less numerous than in\r\nother parts, it is because, to elude the pursuit of the hunters, they\r\nseek refuge in the Altos, where they are found in vast numbers.\r\nSeveral modern travellers have lamented the diminution of the vicuñas,\r\nbut without reason. In former times those animals were hunted more\r\nactively than at present.\r\n\r\nUnder the dynasty of the Incas, when every useful plant and animal was\r\nan object of veneration, the Peruvians rendered almost divine worship\r\nto the llama and his relatives, which exclusively furnished them with\r\nwool for clothing, and with flesh for food. The temples were adorned\r\nwith large figures of these animals made of gold and silver, and their\r\nforms were represented in domestic utensils made of stone and clay.\r\nIn the valuable collection of Baron Clemens von Hügel at Vienna, there\r\nare four of these vessels, composed of porphyry, basalt, and granite,\r\nrepresenting the four species, viz., the llama, the alpaco, the\r\nhuanacu, and the vicuña. These antiquities are exceedingly scarce, and\r\nwhen I was in Peru I was unable to obtain any of them. How the ancient\r\nPeruvians, without the aid of iron tools, were able to carve stone so\r\nbeautifully, is inconceivable.\r\n\r\nBesides the animals above mentioned, several others peculiar to the Puna\r\nare deserving of remark. Among these are the Tarush (_Cervus\r\nantisiensis_, Orb.); the timid roe, which inhabits the high forests\r\nskirting the Andes; the Viscacha (_Lagidium peruanum_, May, and _L.\r\npallipes_, Benn.), and the Chinchilla (_Eriomys Chinchilla_, Licht.),\r\nwhose skin supplies the beautiful fur so much prized by the ladies of\r\nEurope. The viscachas and chinchillas resemble the rabbit in form and\r\ncolor, but they have shorter ears and long rough tails. They live on the\r\nsteep rocky mountains, and in the morning and evening they creep out\r\nfrom their holes and crevices to nibble the alpine grasses. At night the\r\nIndians set before their holes traps made of horse-hair, in which the\r\nanimals are easily caught. The most remarkable of the beasts of prey in\r\nthese high regions is the Atoc (_Canis Azaræ_, Pr. Max.). It is a\r\nspecies of fox, which is found throughout the whole of South America.\r\nThe warmer Puna valleys are inhabited by the Cuguar (_Felis concolor_,\r\nL.), or, as the Indians call it, the Poma. When driven by hunger, this\r\nanimal ventures into the loftiest Puna regions, even to the boundary of\r\nthe eternal snow. The wild Hucumari (_Ursus ornatus_, Fr. Cuv.) but\r\nseldom wanders into the cold Puna. The hucumari is a large black bear,\r\nwith a white muzzle and light-colored stripes on the breast.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous Puna birds, the majority of which may be classed as\r\nwater-fowl, I will notice only a few of the most characteristic. Next\r\nto the condor, the most remarkable bird of prey is the Huarahuau, or\r\nthe Aloi (_Polylorus megalopterus_, Cob.),[68] one of the gyr-falcon\r\nspecies. This bird, which is a constant inhabitant of the level\r\nheights, preys on the carcases of dead horses, mules, &c., but never\r\nattempts to meddle with living animals. It is very harmless, and has\r\nso little timidity, that it suffers itself to be approached near\r\nenough to be knocked down with a stick. The Acacli, or Pito (_Colaptes\r\nrupicola_, Orb.), flutters about the mountains; it is a woodpecker,\r\nbrown-speckled, with a yellow belly. This bird is seen in very great\r\nnumbers, and it is difficult to imagine how it procures food in the\r\nPuna, where there are no insects. All the other woodpecker species\r\nexclusively confine themselves to woody regions.\r\n\r\nThe thickets of rushy grass are inhabited by the Pishacas, or Yutu, a\r\nspecies of partridge (_Tinamotis Pentlandii_, Vig.) which the Indians\r\ncatch by dogs. These dogs of the Puna Indians are a peculiar race\r\n(_Canis Ingæ_, Tsch.). They are distinguished by a small head, a\r\npointed muzzle, small erect ears, a tail curling upwards, and a thick\r\nshaggy skin. They are in a half-wild state, and very surly and\r\nsnappish. They furiously attack strangers, and even after having\r\nreceived a deadly wound they will crawl along the ground, and make an\r\neffort to bite. To white people they appear to have a particular\r\nantipathy; and sometimes it becomes rather a venturous undertaking for\r\na European traveller to approach an Indian hut, for these mountain\r\ndogs spring up to the sides of the horse, and try to bite the rider's\r\nlegs. They are snarlish and intractable even to their masters, who are\r\noften obliged to enforce obedience by the help of a stick. Yet these\r\ndogs are very useful animals for guarding flocks, and they have a keen\r\nscent for the pishacas, which they catch and kill with a single bite.\r\n\r\nThere is a very curious little bird in the Puna, about the size of a\r\nstarling. Its plumage is exceedingly pretty, being on the back brown,\r\nstriped with black; on the throat grey, with two dark stripes, and on\r\nthe breast white. This bird has the remarkable peculiarity of making a\r\nmonotonous sound at the close of every hour, during the night. The\r\nIndians call it the Ingahuallpa, or Cock of the Inga (_Thinocorus\r\nIngæ_, Tsch.), and they associate many superstitious notions with its\r\nregular hourly cry. The Puna morasses and lagunas are animated by\r\nnumerous feathered inhabitants. Among them is the huachua (_Chloephaga\r\nmelanoptera_, Eyt.), a species of goose. The plumage of the body is\r\ndazzlingly white, the wings green, shading into brilliant violet, and\r\nthe feet and beak of a bright red. The Licli (_Charadrius resplendens_,\r\nTsch.) is a plover, whose plumage in color is like that of the huachua,\r\nbut with a sort of metallic brightness. There are two species of ibis\r\nwhich belong to the Puna, though they are occasionally seen in some of\r\nthe lower valleys. One is the Bandurria (_Theristocus melanopis_,\r\nWagl.), and the other is the Yanahuico (_Ibis Ordi_, Bonap.). On the\r\nlagunas swim large flocks of Quiullas (_Larus serranus_, Tsch.), white\r\nmews, with black heads and red beaks, and the gigantic water-hen\r\n(_Fulica gigantea_, Soul.). The plumage of the latter is dark-grey, and\r\nat the root of the red beak there is a large yellow botch, in the form\r\nof a bean, whence the Indians give this bird the name of _Anash sinqui_,\r\nor bean nose. Among the few amphibia found in these regions one is\r\nparticularly remarkable. It is a small kind of toad (_Leiuperus\r\nviridis_, Tsch.), and inhabits the boundaries of the perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nThe grasses of the Puna are used as fodder, and in many of the sheltered\r\nvalleys there are farms (_Haciendas de Ganado_), where large herds of\r\ncattle are reared. The owners of some of these farms possess several\r\nthousand sheep, and from four to five hundred cows. During the rainy\r\nseason the cattle are driven into the Altos. They graze in those high\r\nregions, often at the altitude of 15,000 feet above the sea. When the\r\nfrost sets in they are brought down to the marshy valleys, and they\r\nsuffer much from insufficiency of pasture. From the wool of the sheep a\r\ncoarse kind of cloth, called Bayeta, is made in the Sierra. Some of this\r\nwool is exported, and is much prized in Europe. The old black cattle and\r\nsheep are slaughtered, and their flesh, when dried, is the principal\r\nfood of the inhabitants of the Puna, particularly of the mining\r\npopulation. The dried beef is called _Charqui_, and the mutton is called\r\n_Chalona_. The bulls graze in the remote Altos, and most of them are\r\nreserved for the bull fights in the Sierra villages. As they seldom see\r\na human being they become exceedingly wild; so much so that the herdsmen\r\nare often afraid to approach them. In the daytime they roam about marshy\r\nplaces, and at nightfall they retire for shelter beneath some\r\noverhanging rock. These animals render travelling in many parts of the\r\nPuna extremely dangerous, for they often attack people so suddenly as to\r\nafford no time for defence. It is true they usually announce their\r\napproach by a deep bellow; but the open plain seldom presents any\r\nopportunity for escape. On several occasions a well-aimed shot alone\r\nsaved me from the attack of one of these ferocious bulls.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the haciendas are of rough unhewn stone. They are divided\r\ninto large square rooms, always damp, cold, and uninhabitable. Beneath\r\nthe straw roofs there usually hang long rows of the stuffed skins of\r\nfoxes; for every Indian who kills an old fox receives, by way of\r\nreward, a sheep, and for a young one a lamb. The Cholos are therefore\r\nzealous fox-hunters, and they may possibly succeed in altogether\r\nextirpating that animal which in some districts is so numerous as to\r\nbe a perfect scourge.\r\n\r\nAs the sheep, even in the dry season, find pasture more easily than the\r\nhorned cattle, they are left during the whole year in the higher parts\r\nof the Puna, under the care of Indian shepherds. At night they are\r\ndriven into _cerales_, large square roofless buildings, and are guarded\r\nby dogs. The shepherds make a practice of every year burning the dry\r\ngrass of the Puna, in order to improve the growth of the fodder. A Puna\r\nfire does not, however, present the imposing spectacle of the prairie\r\nfires, as described by travellers in North America, possibly because the\r\nPuna straw is shorter, and is always somewhat damp.\r\n\r\nThe dwellings of the shepherds are built in the same rude style which\r\ncharacterizes all the huts in the Puna, and they impress the European\r\ntraveller with a very unfavorable notion of the intelligence of the\r\npeople. The architecture of these huts consists in laying down some\r\nlarge stones, in a circle of about eight or ten feet in diameter, by\r\nway of a foundation. These stones are covered with earth or turf, and\r\nthen with successive layers of stones and earth, until the wall\r\nattains the height of about four feet: at the point most sheltered\r\nfrom the wind, an opening of a foot and a half or two feet high serves\r\nas a door. On this low circular wall rests the roof, which is formed\r\nin the following manner. Six or eight magay[69] poles are fastened\r\ntogether, so as to form a point at the top. Over these poles thin\r\nlaths are laid horizontally, and fastened with straw-bands, and the\r\nwhole conical-formed frame-work is overlaid with a covering of Puna\r\nstraw. As a security against the wind, two thick straw-bands are\r\ncrossed over the point of the roof, and at their ends, which hang down\r\nto the ground, heavy stones are fastened. The whole fabric is then\r\ncompleted. The hut at its central point is about eight feet high; but\r\nat the sides, no more than three and a half or four feet. The entrance\r\nis so low, that one is obliged to creep in almost bent double; and\r\nbefore the aperture hangs a cow-hide, by way of a door.\r\n\r\nInternally these huts present miserable pictures of poverty and\r\nuncleanliness. Two stones serve as a stove, containing a scanty fire fed\r\nby dry dung (_buñegas_), and turf (_champo_). An earthen pot for cooking\r\nsoup, another for roasting maize, two or three gourd-shells for plates,\r\nand a porongo for containing water, make up the catalogue of the goods\r\nand chattels in a Puna hut. On dirty sheep-skins spread on the ground,\r\nsit the Indian and his wife, listlessly munching their coca; whilst the\r\nnaked children roll about paddling in pools of water formed by continual\r\ndrippings from the roof. The other inhabitants of the hut are usually\r\nthree or four hungry dogs, some lambs, and swarms of guinea-pigs.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it will readily be imagined that a Puna hut is no very\r\nagreeable or inviting retreat. Yet, when worn out by the dangers and\r\nfatigues of a long day's journey, and exposed to the fury of a\r\nmountain storm, the weary traveller, heedless of suffocating clouds of\r\nsmoke and mephitic odors, gladly creeps into the rude dwelling. Taking\r\nup his resting-place on the damp floor, with his saddle-cloth for a\r\npillow, he is thankful to find himself once again in a human\r\nhabitation, even though its occupants be not many degrees elevated\r\nabove the brute creation.\r\n\r\nIn the Puna there are many remains of the great high road of the Incas,\r\nwhich led from Cuzco to Quito, stretching through the whole extent of\r\nPeru. It was the grandest work that America possessed before European\r\ncivilisation found its way to that quarter of the world. Even those who\r\nare unacquainted with the wise dominion of the ancient Peruvian\r\nsovereigns, their comprehensive laws, and the high civilisation they\r\ndiffused over the whole country, must by this gigantic work be impressed\r\nwith the highest idea of the cultivation of the age; for\r\nwell-constructed roads may always be regarded as proofs of a nation's\r\nadvancement. There is not in Peru at the present time any modern road\r\nin the most remote degree comparable to the Incas' highway. The best\r\npreserved fragments which came under my observation were in the\r\nAltos, between Jauja and Tarma. Judging from these portions, it would\r\nappear that the road must have been from twenty-five to thirty feet\r\nbroad, and that it was paved with large flat stones. At intervals of\r\nabout twelve paces distant one from another there is a row of smaller\r\nstones, laid horizontally and a little elevated, so that the road\r\nascended, as it were, by a succession of terraces. It was edged on\r\neach side by a low wall of small stones.\r\n\r\nOther remains of ancient Peru, frequently met with in these parts, are\r\nsmall buildings, formerly used as stations for the messengers who\r\npromulgated the commands of the Incas through all parts of the country.\r\nSome of these buildings are still in a tolerably good state of\r\npreservation. They were always erected on little hillocks, and at such\r\ndistances apart, that from each station the nearest one on either side\r\nwas discernible. When a messenger was despatched from a station a signal\r\nwas hoisted, and a messenger from the next successive station met him\r\nhalfway, and received from him the despatch, which was in this manner\r\nforwarded from one station to another till it reached its destination. A\r\nconstant communication was thus kept up between the capital and the most\r\ndistant parts of the country. A proof of the extraordinary rapidity with\r\nwhich these communications were carried on is the fact, recorded on\r\nunquestionable authority, that the royal table in Cuzco was served with\r\nfresh fish, caught in the sea near the Temple of the Sun in Lurin, a\r\ndistance of more than 200 leagues from Cuzco.\r\n\r\nThe messenger stations have by some travellers been confounded with\r\nthe forts, of which remains are met with along the great Inca road. The\r\nforts were buildings destined for totally different purposes. They were\r\nmagazines for grain, and were built by the Incas to secure to their\r\narmies in these barren regions the requisite supplies of food. Vestiges\r\nof these forts are frequently seen in the Altos of Southern and Central\r\nPeru. They are broad round towers, usually built against a rocky\r\ndeclivity, and with numerous long apertures for the admission of air.\r\n\r\nEven the broad level heights in which no trace of human habitations is\r\ndiscoverable, have been excavated by the mercenary Peruvian mestizos and\r\ncreoles in search of hidden treasures. Their faith in the existence of\r\nconcealed riches is founded on the following tradition. When the last\r\nreigning Inca, Atabiliba or Atahuallpa, was made prisoner by Don\r\nFrancisco Pizarro, in Caxamarca, he proposed to ransom himself from the\r\nSpanish commander. The price he offered for his liberty was to fill with\r\ngold the cell in which he was confined, to the height of a certain line\r\non the wall, which Pizarro marked with his sword. The cell, it may be\r\nmentioned, was twenty-two feet long and seventeen broad. A quantity of\r\ngold which the Inca ordered to be collected in Caxamarca and its\r\nvicinity, when piled up on the floor of the cell, did not reach above\r\nhalfway to the given mark. The Inca then despatched messengers to Cuzco\r\nto obtain from the royal treasury the gold required to make up the\r\ndeficiency; and accordingly eleven thousand llamas were despatched from\r\nCuzco to Caxamarca, each laden with one hundred pounds of gold. But ere\r\nthe treasure reached its destination, Atahuallpa was hanged by the\r\nadvice of Don Diego de Almangra and the Dominican monk Vicente de\r\nValverde. The terror-stirring news flew like wild-fire through the land,\r\nand speedily reached the convoy of Indians, who were driving their\r\nrichly-laden llamas over the level heights into Central Peru. On the\r\nspot where the intelligence of Atahuallpa's death was communicated to\r\nthem, the dismayed Indians concealed the treasure, and then dispersed.\r\n\r\nWhether the number of the llamas was really so considerable as it is\r\nstated to have been, may fairly be doubted; but that a vast quantity\r\nof gold was on its way to Caxamarca, and was concealed, is a\r\nwell-authenticated fact. That the Indians should never have made any\r\nattempt to recover this treasure is quite consistent with their\r\ncharacter. It is not improbable that even now some particular\r\nindividuals among them may know the place of concealment; but a\r\ncertain feeling of awe transmitted through several centuries from\r\nfather to son, has, in their minds, associated the hidden treasure\r\nwith the blood of their last king, and this feeling doubtless prompts\r\nthem to keep the secret inviolate.\r\n\r\nFrom traditionary accounts, which bear the appearance of probability,\r\nit would appear that the gold was buried somewhere in the Altos of Mito,\r\nnear the valley of Jauja. Searches have frequently been made in that\r\nvicinity, but no clue to the hiding-place has yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Some derive the word Andes from the people called Antis,\r\nwho dwelt at the foot of these chains of mountains.

This is the celebrated Cerro de Pasco, famed\r\nthroughout the world for its rich silver mines. It is situated in 10°\r\n48' S. latitude and 76° 23' W. longitude, and at the height of 13,673\r\nfeet above the sea level. It is built in a basin-shaped hollow,\r\nencircled by barren and precipitous rocks. Between these rocks difficult\r\nwinding roads or paths lead down to the city, which spreads out in\r\nirregular divisions, surrounded on all sides by little lagunes, or\r\nswamps. The pleasing impression created by the first view of Cerro de\r\nPasco from the heights is very greatly modified on entering the town.\r\nCrooked, narrow, and dirty streets are bordered by rows of\r\nirregularly-built houses; and miserable Indian huts abut close against\r\nwell-built dwellings, whose size and structure give a certain European\r\ncharacter to the city when viewed from a distance. Without bestowing a\r\nglance on the busy throng which circulates through the streets and\r\nsquares, the varied styles of the buildings sufficiently indicate to the\r\nobserver how many different classes of people have united together to\r\nfound, in the tropics, and on the very confines of the perpetual snow, a\r\ncity of such magnitude, and of so motley an aspect. The wild barrenness\r\nof the surrounding scenery, and the extreme cold of the rigorous\r\nclimate--the remote and solitary position of the city--all denote that\r\none common bond of union must have drawn together the diversified\r\nelements which compose the population of Cerro de Pasco. And so it\r\nreally is. In this inhospitable region, where the surface of the soil\r\nproduces nothing, nature has buried boundless stores of wealth in the\r\nbowels of the earth, and the silver mines of Cerro de Pasco have drawn\r\npeople from all parts of the world to one point, and for one object.\r\n\r\nHistory relates that about two hundred and fifteen years ago an Indian\r\nshepherd, named Huari Capcha, tended his flocks on a small pampa to the\r\nsouth-east of the Lake of Llauricocha, the mother of the great river\r\nAmazon. One day, when the shepherd had wandered farther than usual from\r\nhis hut, he sought a resting-place on a declivity of the Cerro de\r\nSantiestevan, and when evening drew in he kindled a fire to protect\r\nhimself against the cold; he then lay down to sleep. When he awoke on\r\nthe following morning, he was amazed to find the stone beneath the ashes\r\nof his fire melted and turned to silver. He joyfully communicated the\r\ndiscovery to his master, Don Jose Ugarte, a Spaniard, who owned a\r\nhacienda in the Quebrada de Huariaca. Ugarte forthwith repaired to the\r\nspot, where he found indications of a very rich vein of silver ore,\r\nwhich he immediately made active preparations for working. In this mine,\r\nwhich is distinguished by the name of _La Descubridora_ (the\r\ndiscoverer), silver is still obtained. From the village of Pasco, about\r\ntwo leagues distant, where already productive mines were worked, several\r\nrich mine owners removed to Llauricocha; here they sought and discovered\r\nnew veins, and established new mining works. The vast abundance of the\r\nore drew new speculators to the spot; some to work the mines, and others\r\nto supply the necessary wants of the increasing population. In this\r\nmanner was rapidly founded a city, which, at times when the produce of\r\nmetal is very considerable, counts 18,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn Cerro de Pasco there are two very remarkable veins of silver. One of\r\nthem, the Veta de Colquirirca, runs nearly in a straight line from north\r\nto south, and has already been traced to the length of 9,600 feet, and\r\nthe breadth of 412; the other vein is the Veta de Pariarirca, which\r\ntakes a direction from east-south-east to west-north-west, and which\r\nintersects the Veta de Colquirirca precisely, it is supposed, under the\r\nmarket-place of the city. Its known extent is 6,400 feet in length, and\r\n380 feet in breadth. From these large veins numberless smaller ones\r\nbranch off in various directions, so that a net-work of silver may be\r\nsupposed to spread beneath the surface of the earth. Some thousand\r\nopenings or mouths (_bocaminas_) are the entrances to these mines. Most\r\nof these entrances are within the city itself, in small houses; and some\r\nare in the dwellings of the mine-owners. Many of them are exceedingly\r\nshallow, and not more than five hundred deserve the name of shafts. All\r\nare worked in a very disorderly and careless way; the grand object of\r\ntheir owners being to avoid expense. The dangerous parts in the shafts\r\nare never walled up, and the excavations proceed without the adoption\r\nof any measures of security. The consequence is, that accidents caused\r\nby the falling in of the galleries are of frequent occurrence; and\r\nevery year the lives of numbers of the Indian miners are sacrificed. A\r\nmelancholy example of the effects of this negligence is presented by\r\nthe now ruined mine of Matagente (literally _Kill People_), in which\r\nthree hundred laborers were killed by the falling in of a shaft. I\r\ndescended into several of the mines, among others into the\r\n_Descubridora_, which is one of the deepest, and I always felt that I\r\nhad good reason to congratulate myself on returning to the surface of\r\nthe earth in safety. Rotten blocks of wood and loose stones serve for\r\nsteps, and, where these cannot be placed, the shaft, which in most\r\ninstances runs nearly perpendicular, is descended by the help of rusty\r\nchains and ropes, whilst loose fragments of rubbish are continually\r\nfalling from the damp walls.\r\n\r\nThe mine laborers, all of whom are Indians, are of two classes. One\r\nclass consists of those who work in the mines all the year round without\r\nintermission, and who receive regular wages from the mine owners;--the\r\nother class consists of those who make only temporary visits to Cerro de\r\nPasco, when they are attracted thither by the _boyas_.[70] This latter\r\nclass of laborers are called _maquipuros_. Most of them come from the\r\ndistant provinces, and they return to their homes when the boya is at an\r\nend. The mine laborers are also subdivided into two classes, the one\r\ncalled _barreteros_, whose employment consists in breaking the ore; and\r\nthe other called _hapires_, or _chaquiris_, who bring up the ore from\r\nthe shaft. The work allotted to the hapires is exceedingly laborious.\r\nEach load consists of from fifty to seventy-five pounds of metal, which\r\nis carried in a very irksome and inconvenient manner in an untanned\r\nhide, called a capacho. The hapire performs his toilsome duty in a state\r\nof nudity, for, notwithstanding the coldness of the climate, he becomes\r\nso heated by his laborious exertion, that he is glad to divest himself\r\nof his clothing. As the work is carried on incessantly day and night,\r\nthe miners are divided into parties called _puntas_, each party working\r\nfor twelve successive hours. At six o'clock morning and evening the\r\n_puntas_ are relieved. Each one is under the inspection of a mayor-domo.\r\nWhen a mine yields a scanty supply of metal, the laborers are paid in\r\nmoney; the barreteros receiving six reals per day, and the hapires only\r\nfour. During the _boyas_ the laborers receive instead of their wages in\r\nmoney, a share of the ore. The Indians often try to appropriate to\r\nthemselves surreptitiously pieces of ore; but to do this requires great\r\ncunning and dexterity, so narrowly are they watched by the mayor-domos.\r\nNevertheless, they sometimes succeed. One of the hapires related to me\r\nhow he had contrived to carry off a most valuable piece of silver. He\r\nfastened it on his back, and then wrapping himself in his poncho, he\r\npretended to be so ill, that he obtained permission to quit the mine.\r\nTwo of his confederates who helped him out, assisted him in concealing\r\nthe treasure. The _polvorilla_, a dark powdery kind of ore, very full of\r\nsilver, used to be abstracted from the mines by the following stratagem.\r\nThe workmen would strip off their clothes, and having moistened the\r\nwhole of their bodies with water, would roll themselves in the\r\n_polvorilla_ which stuck to them. On their return home they washed off\r\nthe silver-dust and sold it for several dollars. But this trick being\r\ndetected, a stop was soon put to it, for, before leaving the mines, the\r\nlaborers are now required to strip in order to be searched.\r\n\r\nThe operation of separating the silver from the dross is performed at\r\nsome distance from Cerro de Pasco, in haciendas, belonging to the great\r\nmine owners. The process is executed in a very clumsy, imperfect, and at\r\nthe same time, a very expensive manner. The amalgamation of the\r\nquicksilver with the metal is effected by the tramping of horses. The\r\nanimals employed in this way are a small ill-looking race, brought from\r\nAyacucho and Cuzco, where they are found in numerous herds. The\r\nquicksilver speedily has a fatal effect on their hoofs, and after a few\r\nyears the animals become unfit for work. The separation of the metals is\r\nmanaged with as little judgment as the amalgamation, and the waste of\r\nquicksilver is enormous. It is computed that on each mark of silver,\r\nhalf a pound of quicksilver is expended. The quicksilver, with the\r\nexception of some little brought from Idria and Huancavelica, comes from\r\nSpain in iron jars, each containing about seventy-five pounds weight of\r\nthe metal. In Lima the price of these jars is from sixty to 100 dollars\r\neach, but they are occasionally sold as high as 135 or 140 dollars.\r\nConsidering the vast losses which the Peruvian mine owners sustain by\r\nthe waste of quicksilver and the defective mode of refining, it may\r\nfairly be inferred, that their profits are about one-third less than\r\nthey would be under a better system of management.\r\n\r\nIn Cerro de Pasco there are places called _boliches_, in which the\r\nsilver is separated from the dross by the same process as that practised\r\nin the _haciendas_, only on a smaller scale. In the _boliches_ the\r\namalgamation is performed, not by horses but by Indians, who mix the\r\nquicksilver with the ore by stamping on it with their feet for several\r\nhours in succession. This occupation they usually perform barefooted,\r\nand the consequence is, that paralysis and other diseases caused by the\r\naction of mercury, are very frequent among the persons thus employed.\r\nThe owners of the _boliches_, who are mostly Italians, are not mine\r\nproprietors. They obtain the metal from the Indians, who give them their\r\n_huachacas_[71] in exchange for brandy and other articles. On the other\r\nhand, the owners of the _boliches_ obtain the money required for their\r\nspeculations from capitalists, who make them pay an enormous interest.\r\nNevertheless, many amass considerable fortunes in the course of a few\r\nyears; for they scruple not to take the most unjust advantage of the\r\nIndians, whose laborious toil is rewarded by little gain.\r\n\r\nThe law requires that all the silver drawn from the mines of Cerro de\r\nPasco shall be conveyed to a government smelting-house, called the\r\n_Callana_, there to be cast into bars of one hundred pounds weight, to\r\nbe stamped, and charged with certain imposts. The value of silver in\r\nCerro de Pasco varies from seven to eight dollars per mark. The standard\r\nvalue in Lima is eight dollars and a half.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to form anything like an accurate estimate of the\r\nyearly produce of the mines of Cerro de Pasco; for a vast quantity of\r\nsilver is never taken to the Callana, but is smuggled to the coast,\r\nand from thence shipped for Europe. In the year 1838, no less than\r\n85,000 marks of contraband silver were conveyed to the sea port of\r\nHuacho, and safely shipped on board a schooner. The quantity of silver\r\nannually smelted and stamped in the Callana is from two to three\r\nhundred thousand marks--seldom exceeding the latter amount. From 1784\r\nto 1820, 1826, and 1827, the amount was 8,051,409 marks; in the year\r\n1784 it was 68,208 marks; and in 1785, 73,455 marks. During seventeen\r\nyears it was under 200,000 marks; and only during three years above\r\n300,000. The produce of the mines is exceedingly fluctuating. The\r\nsuccessive revolutions which have agitated the country have tended\r\nvery considerably to check mining operations. On the overthrow of\r\nSanta Cruz, Don Miguel Otero, the most active and intelligent mine\r\nowner of Cerro de Pasco, was banished; an event which had a very\r\ndepressing influence on all the mining transactions of that part of\r\nSouth America. Within the last few years, however, mining has\r\nreceived a new impetus, and attention has been directed to the\r\nadoption of a more speedy and less expensive system of amalgamation.\r\n\r\nAs a place of residence Cerro de Pasco is exceedingly disagreeable;\r\nnothing but the pursuit of wealth can reconcile any one to a long\r\nabode in it. The climate, like that of the higher Puna, is cold and\r\nstormy. The better sort of houses are well built, and are provided\r\nwith good English fire-places and chimneys. But however comfortably\r\nlodged, the new comer cannot easily reconcile himself to the\r\nreflection that the earth is hollow beneath his feet. Still less\r\nagreeable is it to be awakened in the night by the incessant hammering\r\nof the Indian miners. Luckily earthquakes are of rare occurrence in\r\nthose parts: it would require no very violent shock to bury the whole\r\ncity in the bosom of the earth.\r\n\r\nSilver being the only produce of the soil, the necessaries of life are\r\nall exceedingly dear in the Cerro, as they have to be brought from\r\ndistant places. The warehouses are, it is true, always plentifully\r\nsupplied even with the choicest luxuries; but the extortion of venders\r\nand the abundance of money render prices most exorbitant. The market\r\nis so well supplied with provisions that it may vie with that of Lima.\r\nThe products of the coast, of the table-lands and the forests, are all\r\nto be procured in the market of Cerro de Pasco; but the price demanded\r\nfor every article is invariably more than double its worth. House\r\nrents are also extravagantly high; and the keep of horses is\r\nexceedingly expensive.\r\n\r\nThe population of Cerro de Pasco presents a motley assemblage of human\r\nbeings, such as one would scarcely expect to find in a city situated\r\nat 14,000 feet above the sea, and encircled by wild mountains. The Old\r\nand the New Worlds seem there to have joined hands, and there is\r\nscarcely any nation of Europe or America that has not its\r\nrepresentative in Cerro de Pusco. The Swede and the Sicilian, the\r\nCanadian and the Argentinian, are all united here at one point, and\r\nfor one object. The inhabitants of this city may be ranked in two\r\ndivisions, viz., traders and miners--taking both terms in their most\r\ncomprehensive sense. The mercantile population consists chiefly of\r\nEuropeans or white Creoles, particularly those who are owners of large\r\nmagazines. The keepers of coffee houses and brandy shops are here, as\r\nin Lima, chiefly Italians from Genoa. Other shops are kept by the\r\nMestizos, and the provision-dealers are chiefly Indians, who bring\r\ntheir supplies from remote places.\r\n\r\nThe mining population may be divided into mine owners (_mineros_) and\r\nIndian laborers. The majority of the mineros are descendants of the old\r\nSpanish families, who, at an early period, became possessors of the\r\nmines, whence they derived enormous wealth, which most of them\r\ndissipated in prodigal extravagance. At the present time, only a very\r\nfew of the mineros are rich enough to defray, from their own resources,\r\nthe vast expense attending the operations of mining. They consequently\r\nraise the required money by loans from the capitalists of Lima, who\r\nrequire interest of 100 or 120 per cent., and, moreover, insist on\r\nhaving bars of silver at a price below standard value. To these hard\r\nconditions, together with the custom that has been forced upon the\r\nminers of paying their laborers in metal, at times when it is very\r\nabundant, may be traced the cause of the miserable system of\r\nmine-working practised in Cerro de Pasco. To liquidate his burthensome\r\ndebts the minero makes his laborers dig as much ore as possible from the\r\nmine, without any precautions being taken to guard against accidents.\r\nThe money-lenders, on the other hand, have no other security for the\r\nrecovery of their re-payment than the promise of the minero, and a\r\nfailure of the usual produce of a mine exposes them to the risk of\r\nlosing the money they have advanced.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it can scarcely be expected that the character\r\nand habits of the minero should qualify him to take a high rank in the\r\nsocial scale. His insatiable thirst for wealth continually prompts him\r\nto embark in new enterprises, whereby he frequently loses in one what he\r\ngains in another. After a mine has been worked without gain for a series\r\nof years, an unexpected _boya_ probably occurs, and an immense quantity\r\nof silver may be extracted. But a minero retiring on the proceeds of a\r\nboya is an event of rare occurrence. A vain hope of increasing fortune\r\nprompts him to risk the certain for the uncertain: and the result\r\nfrequently is, that the once prosperous minero has nothing to bequeath\r\nto his children but a mine heavily burthened with debt. The\r\npersevering ardor of persons engaged in mining is truly remarkable.\r\nUnchecked by disappointment, they pursue the career in which they have\r\nembarked. Even when ruin appears inevitable, the love of money subdues\r\nthe warnings of reason, and hope conjures up, from year to year,\r\nvisionary pictures of riches yet to come.\r\n\r\nJoined to this infatuated pursuit of the career once entered on, an\r\ninordinate passion for cards and dice contributes to ruin many of the\r\nmineros of Cerro de Pasco. In few other places are such vast sums staked\r\nat the gaming-table; for the superabundance of silver feeds that\r\nnational vice of the Spaniards and their descendants. From the earliest\r\nhours of morning cards and dice are in requisition. The mine owner\r\nleaves his silver stores, and the shop-keeper forsakes his counter, to\r\npass a few hours every day at the gaming-table; and card-playing is\r\nthe only amusement in the best houses of the town. The mayordomos,\r\nafter being engaged in the mines throughout the whole day, assemble\r\nwith their comrades in the evening, round the gaming-table, from which\r\nthey often do not rise until six in the morning, when the bell summons\r\nthem to resume their subterraneous occupations. They not unfrequently\r\ngamble away their share of a boya before any indication of one is\r\ndiscernible in the mine.\r\n\r\nThe working class of miners is composed of Indians, who throng to Cerro\r\nde Pasco from all the provinces, far and near, especially when boyas are\r\nexpected. At times, when the mines are not very productive, the number\r\nof Indian laborers amounts to between three and four thousand; but when\r\nthere is a great supply of metal, the ordinary number of mine-workers is\r\nmore than tripled. The Indians labor with a degree of patient industry,\r\nwhich it would be vain to expect from European workmen similarly\r\ncircumstanced. This observation applies to the hapires in particular.\r\nContent with wretched food, and still more wretched lodging, the hapire\r\ngoes through his hard day's work, partaking of no refreshment but coca,\r\nand at the end of the week (deduction being made for the food, &c.,\r\nobtained on credit from the minero), he, possibly, finds himself in\r\npossession of a dollar. This sum he spends on his Sunday holiday in\r\nchicha and brandy, of which he takes as much as his money will pay\r\nfor, or as he can get on credit. When excited by strong drinks, such\r\nas maize beer, chicha, and brandy, to which they are very much\r\naddicted, the Indian miners are exceedingly quarrelsome. The laborers\r\nbelonging to the different mines go about the streets rioting and\r\nattacking each other, and they frequently get involved in dangerous\r\naffrays. No Sunday or Friday passes over without the occurrence of\r\nbattles, in which knives, sticks, and stones are used as weapons; and\r\nthe actors in these scenes of violence inflict on each other severe\r\nand often fatal wounds. Any effective police interference to quell\r\nthese street riots, is out of the question.\r\n\r\nWhen an unusually abundant produce of the mines throws extra payment\r\ninto the hands of the mine laborers, they squander their money with the\r\nmost absurd extravagance, and they are excellent customers to the\r\nEuropean dealers in dress and other articles of luxury. Prompted by a\r\nludicrous spirit of imitation, the Indian, in his fits of drunkenness,\r\nwill purchase costly things which he can have no possible use for, and\r\nwhich he becomes weary of, after an hour's possession. I once saw an\r\nIndian purchase a cloak of fine cloth, for which he paid ninety-two\r\ndollars. He then repaired to a neighboring pulperia,[72] where he drank\r\ntill he became intoxicated, and then, staggering into the street, he\r\nfell down, and rolled in the kennel. On rising, and discovering that his\r\ncloak was besmeared with mud, he threw it off, and left it in the\r\nstreet, for any one who might choose to pick it up. Such acts of\r\nreckless prodigality are of daily occurrence. A watchmaker in Cerro de\r\nPasco informed me that one day an Indian came to his shop to purchase\r\na gold watch. He showed him one, observing that the price was twelve\r\ngold ounces (204 dollars), and that it would probably be too dear for\r\nhim. The Cholo paid the money, and took the watch; then, after having\r\nexamined it for a few minutes, he dashed it on the ground, observing\r\nthat the thing was of no use to him. When the Indian miner possesses\r\nmoney, he never thinks of laying by a part of it, as neither he nor\r\nany of his family feel the least ambition to improve their miserable\r\nway of life. With them, drinking is the highest of all gratifications,\r\nand in the enjoyment of the present moment, they lose sight of all\r\nconsiderations for the future. Even those Cholos who come from distant\r\nparts of the country to share in the rich harvest of the mines of\r\nCerro de Pasco, return to their homes as poor as when they left them,\r\nand with manners and morals vastly deteriorated.\r\n\r\nBesides the mines of Cerro de Pasco, which in point of importance are\r\nnowise inferior to those of Potosi, there are numerous very rich mining\r\ndistricts in Peru. Among the most prolific may be ranked the provinces\r\nof Pataz, Huamanchuco, Caxamarca, and Hualgayoc. In this last-named\r\nprovince is situated the Cerro de San Fernando, on which Alexander Von\r\nHumboldt has conferred so much celebrity. The rich silver veins were\r\ndiscovered there in the year 1771; and there are now upwards of 1400\r\nbocaminas. On the insulated mountain the veins of metal intersect each\r\nother in every direction, and they are alike remarkable for being easily\r\nworked and exceedingly prolific. The mines of Huantaxaya, situated on\r\nthe coast in the neighborhood of Iquique, were also very rich, and the\r\nsilver obtained from them was either pure or containing a very slight\r\nadmixture of foreign substances. They yielded an incredible quantity of\r\nmetal, but they were speedily exhausted; and are now totally barren. The\r\nchains of hills in the southern districts of Peru contain a multitude of\r\nvery rich mines, of which the most remarkable are those of San Antonio\r\nde Esquilache, Tamayos, Picotani, Cancharani, and Chupicos; but owing to\r\nbad working and defective drainage, many of the veins are in a very\r\nruinous state, and the metal drawn from them bears no proportion to the\r\nquantity they contain. The Salcedo mine is very celebrated for the vast\r\nabundance of its produce, and the tragical end of its original owner.\r\n\r\nDon Jose Salcedo, a poor Spaniard, who dwelt in Puno, was in love with a\r\nyoung Indian girl, whose mother promised, on condition of his marrying\r\nher daughter, that she would show him a rich silver mine. Salcedo\r\nfulfilled the condition, obtained possession of the mine, and worked it\r\nwith the greatest success. The report of his wealth soon roused the envy\r\nof the Count de Lemos, then viceroy of Peru, who sought to possess\r\nhimself of the mine. By his generosity and benevolence Salcedo had\r\nbecome a great favorite with the Indian population, and the viceroy took\r\nadvantage of this circumstance to accuse him of high treason, on the\r\nground that he was exciting the Indians against the Spanish government.\r\nSalcedo was arrested, tried, and condemned to death. Whilst he was in\r\nprison, he begged to be permitted to send to Madrid the documents\r\nrelating to his trial, and to appeal to the mercy of the king. He\r\nproposed, if the viceroy would grant his request, that he would pay him\r\nthe daily tribute of a bar of silver, from the time when the ship left\r\nthe port of Callao with the documents, until the day of her return. When\r\nit is recollected that at that period the voyage from Callao to Spain\r\noccupied from twelve to sixteen months, some idea may be formed of the\r\nenormous wealth of Salcedo and his mine. The viceroy rejected this\r\nproposition, ordered Salcedo to be hanged, and set out for Puno to take\r\npossession of the mine.[73]\r\n\r\nBut this cruel and unjust proceeding failed in the attainment of its\r\nobject. As soon as Salcedo's death-doom was pronounced, his\r\nmother-in-law, accompanied by a number of relations and friends,\r\nrepaired to the mine, flooded it with water, destroyed the works, and\r\nclosed up the entrance so effectually that it was impossible to trace it\r\nout. They then dispersed; but some of them, who were afterwards\r\ncaptured, could not be induced, either by promises or tortures, to\r\nreveal the position of the mouth of the mine, which to this day remains\r\nundiscovered. All that is known about it is that it was situated in the\r\nneighborhood of Cerro de Laycacota and Cananchari.\r\n\r\nAnother extraordinary example of the productiveness of the Peruvian\r\nmines, is found at San Jose, in the department of Huancavelica. The\r\nowner of the mines of San Jose requested the viceroy Castro, whose\r\nfriend he was, to become godfather to his first child. The viceroy\r\nconsented, but at the time fixed for the christening, some important\r\naffair of state prevented him from quitting the capital, and he sent\r\nthe vice-queen to officiate as his proxy. To render honor to his\r\nillustrious guest, the owner of the San Jose mines laid down a triple\r\nrow of silver bars along the whole way (and it was no very short\r\ndistance), from his house to church. Over this silver pavement the\r\nvice-queen accompanied the infant to the church, where it was\r\nbaptized. On her return, her munificent host presented to her the\r\nwhole of the silver road, in token of his gratitude for the honor she\r\nhad conferred on him. Since that time, the mines and the province in\r\nwhich they are situated have borne the name of Castrovireyna. In most\r\nof these mines the works have been discontinued. Owing to defective\r\narrangements, one of the richest of these mines fell in, and 122\r\nworkmen were buried in the ruins. Since that catastrophe, the Indians\r\nrefuse to enter the mines. Many stories are related of spirits and\r\napparitions said to haunt the mines of Castrovireyna. I was surprised\r\nto hear these tales, for the imagination of the Indian miners is not\r\nvery fertile in the creation of this sort of superstitious terrors.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the enormous amount of wealth, which the mines of Peru\r\nhave already yielded, and still continue to yield, only a very small\r\nportion of the silver veins has been worked. It is a well-known fact,\r\nthat the Indians are aware of the existence of many rich mines, the\r\nsituation of which they will never disclose to the whites, nor to the\r\ndetested mestizos. Heretofore mining has been to them all toil and\r\nlittle profit, and it has bound them in chains from which they will not\r\neasily emancipate themselves. For centuries past, the knowledge of some\r\nof the richest silver mines has been with inviolable secresy transmitted\r\nfrom father to son. All endeavors to prevail on them to divulge these\r\nsecrets have hitherto been fruitless. In the village of Huancayo, there\r\nlived, a few years ago, two brothers, Don Jose and Don Pedro Yriarte,\r\ntwo of the most eminent mineros of Peru. Having obtained certain\r\nintelligence that in the neighboring mountains there existed some veins\r\nof pure silver, they sent a young man, their agent, to endeavor to gain\r\nfurther information on the subject. The agent took up his abode in the\r\ncottage of a shepherd, to whom, however, he gave not the slightest\r\nintimation of the object of his mission. After a little time, an\r\nattachment arose between the young man and the shepherd's daughter, and\r\nthe girl promised to disclose to her lover the position of a very rich\r\nmine. On a certain day, when she was going out to tend her sheep, she\r\ntold him to follow her at a distance, and to notice the spot where she\r\nwould let fall her _manta_; by turning up the earth on that spot, she\r\nassured him he would find the mouth of a mine. The young man did as he\r\nwas directed, and after digging for a little time, he discovered a mine\r\nof considerable depth, containing rich ore. Whilst busily engaged in\r\nbreaking out the metal, he was joined by the girl's father, who\r\nexpressed himself delighted at the discovery, and offered to assist\r\nhim. After they had been at work for some hours, the old Indian handed\r\nto his companion a cup of chicha, which the young man thankfully\r\naccepted. But he had no sooner tasted the liquor than he felt ill, and\r\nhe soon became convinced that poison had been mixed with the beverage.\r\nHe snatched up the bag containing the metal he had collected, mounted\r\nhis horse, and with the utmost speed galloped off to Huancayo. There,\r\nhe related to Yriarte all that had occurred, described as accurately\r\nas he could the situation of the mine, and died on the following\r\nnight. Active measures were immediately set on foot, to trace out the\r\nmine, but without effect. The Indian and all his family had\r\ndisappeared, and the mine was never discovered.\r\n\r\nIn Huancayo there also dwelt a Franciscan monk. He was an inveterate\r\ngamester, and was involved in pecuniary embarrassments. The Indians in\r\nthe neighborhood of his dwelling-place were much attached to him, and\r\nfrequently sent him presents of poultry, cheese, butter, &c. One day,\r\nafter he had been a loser at the gaming-table, he complained bitterly of\r\nhis misfortunes to an Indian, who was his particular friend. After some\r\ndeliberation, the Indian observed, that possibly he could render him\r\nsome assistance; and, accordingly, on the following evening, he brought\r\nhim a large bag full of rich silver ore. This present was several times\r\nrepeated; but the monk, not satisfied, pressed the Indian to show him\r\nthe mine from whence the treasure was drawn. The Indian consented, and\r\non an appointed night he came, accompanied by two of his comrades, to\r\nthe dwelling of the Franciscan. They blindfolded him, and each in turn\r\ncarried him on his shoulders to a distance of several leagues, into the\r\nmountain passes. At length they set him down, and the bandage being\r\nremoved from his eyes, he discovered that he was in a small and somewhat\r\nshallow shaft, and was surrounded by bright masses of silver. He was\r\nallowed to take as much as he could carry, and when laden with the rich\r\nprize, he was again blindfolded, and conveyed home in the same manner as\r\nhe had been brought to the mine. Whilst the Indians were conducting him\r\nhome, he hit on the following stratagem. He unfastened his rosary, and\r\nhere and there dropped one of the beads, hoping by this means to be\r\nenabled to trace his way back on the following day; but in the course of\r\na couple of hours his Indian friend again knocked at his door, and\r\npresenting to him a handful of beads, said, \"Father, you dropped your\r\nrosary on the way, and I have picked it up.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Jauja, in the year 1841, an Indian whom I had previously\r\nknown, from his having accompanied me on one of my journeys in the\r\nSierra, came to me and asked me to lend him a crow-bar. I did so, and\r\nafter a few days, when he returned it, I observed that the end was\r\ncovered with silver. Some time afterwards I learned that this Indian had\r\nbeen imprisoned by order of the sub-prefect, because he had offered for\r\nsale some very rich silver ore, and on being questioned as to where he\r\nhad obtained it, his answer was that he found it on the road; a tale,\r\nthe truth of which was very naturally doubted. The following year, when\r\nI was again in Jauja, the Indian paid me another visit. He then informed\r\nme that he had been for several months confined in a dark dungeon and\r\nhalf-starved, because the sub-prefect wanted to compel him to reveal the\r\nsituation of a mine which he knew of, but that he would not disclose the\r\nsecret, and adhered firmly to the statement he had made of having found\r\nthe ore. After a little further conversation, he became more\r\ncommunicative than I had any reason to expect, though he was fully\r\nconvinced I would not betray him. He confessed to me that he actually\r\nknew of a large vein containing valuable silver, of which he showed me a\r\nspecimen. He further told me that it was only when he was much in want\r\nof money that he had recourse to the mine, of which the shaft was not\r\nvery deep; and, moreover, that after closing it up, he always carried\r\nthe loose rubbish away to a distance of some miles, and then covered\r\nthe opening so carefully with turf and cactus, that it was impossible\r\nfor any one to discern it. This Indian dwelt in a miserable hut, about\r\nthree leagues from Jauja, and his occupation was making wooden stirrups,\r\nwhich employment scarcely enabled him to earn a scanty subsistence. He\r\nassured me it was only when he was called upon to pay contributions,\r\nwhich the government exacts with merciless rigor, that he had recourse\r\nto the mine. He then extracted about half an aroba of ore, and sold it\r\nin Jauja, in order to pay the tax levied on him.\r\n\r\nI could quote many well-authenticated instances of the same kind; but\r\nthe above examples sufficiently prove the reluctance of the Indians to\r\ndisclose the secret of their hidden treasures, and their indifference\r\nabout obtaining wealth for themselves. It is true that the Indians are\r\nnot, in all parts of the country, so resolutely reserved as they are in\r\nHuancayo and Jauja, for all the most important mines have been made\r\nknown to the Spaniards by the natives. But the Peruvian Indians are\r\ncomposed of many different races, and though all were united by the\r\nIncas into one nation, yet they still differ from each other in manners\r\nand character. The sentiment of hatred towards the whites and their\r\ndescendants has not been kept up in an equal degree among them all. In\r\nproportion as some are friendly and social with the Creoles, others\r\nare reserved and distrustful. In general, the Indians regard with\r\nunfriendly feelings those whites who seek to trace out new mines; for\r\nthey cherish a bitter recollection of the fate of Huari Capcha, the\r\ndiscoverer of the mines of Cerro de Pasco, who, it is said, was thrown\r\ninto a dungeon by the Spaniard, Ugarte, and ended his days in\r\ncaptivity. I have not met with any proofs of the authenticity of this\r\nstory, but I frequently heard it related by the Indians, who referred\r\nto it as their justification for withholding from the whites any\r\ndirections for finding mines.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Cerro de Pasco. That city has, by its wealth, become\r\none of the most important in the Peruvian Republic; and under improved\r\nlegislation, and a judicious mining system, it might be rendered still\r\nmore prosperous and fully deserving of its title of \"Treasury of\r\nPeru.\" Though from its situation Cerro de Pasco is cut off from the\r\nprincipal lines of communication with other parts of Peru, yet the\r\ncity is itself the central point of four roads, on which there is\r\nconsiderable traffic. Westward runs the road to Lima, through the\r\nQuebrada of Canta, by which all the silver that is not contraband is\r\ntransported to the capital. The silver, when melted into bars, is\r\nconsigned to the care of the mule-drivers, merely on their giving a\r\nreceipt for it; and in this manner they are sometimes entrusted with\r\nloads of the value of several hundred thousand dollars, which they\r\nconvey to Lima unattended by any guards or escort. There is, however,\r\nno danger of their being plundered; for the robbers do not take the\r\nstamped bars of silver. The silver specie, on the other hand, which is\r\nsent from Lima, is escorted by a military guard as far as Llanga or\r\nSanta Rosa de Quibe. The escort is not, however, very adequate to\r\nresist the highway robbers, consisting of numerous bands of armed\r\nnegroes. On the east is the road running through the Quebrada de\r\nHuarriaca to the town of Huanuco and the Huallaga Forests. The road on\r\nthe north of Cerro de Pasco leads to the village of Huanuco el Viejo,\r\none of the most remarkable places of Peru, being full of interesting\r\nruins of the time of the Incas. From Huanuco the road leads to Huaraz,\r\nand from thence to the north coast. The south road passes over the\r\nlevel heights to Tarma, Jauja, and the other southern provinces.\r\n\r\nFrom the village of Pasco two roads diverge, the one leading to Lima,\r\nthe other to Tarma. The former crosses the Pampa of Bombon and the\r\nDiezmo, and continues onward to the Pass of La Viuda. The latter leads\r\nby way of the Tambo Ninacaca, and the village of Carhuamayo[74] to\r\nJunin, passing near a very large lake, situated at the height of 13,000\r\nfeet above the sea. This lake is the Laguna de Chinchaycocha,[75] which\r\nis twelve leagues long, and at its utmost breadth measures two leagues\r\nand a half. It is the largest of the South American lakes, next to the\r\nLaguna de Titicaca, which is eighty-four English miles long and\r\nforty-one broad. As the lake of Chinchaycocha loses by various outlets\r\nmuch more water than it receives from its tributary sources, it is\r\nevident that it must be fed by subterraneous springs. Its marshy banks\r\nare overgrown by totora (_Malacochæte Totora_), and are inhabited by\r\nnumerous water fowl. The Indians entertain a superstitious belief that\r\nthis lake is haunted by huge, fish-like animals, who at certain hours of\r\nthe night leave their watery abode to prowl about the adjacent pasture\r\nlands, where they commit great havoc among the cattle. The southwestern\r\nend of the lake is intersected by a marshy piece of ground, interspersed\r\nwith stones, called the Calzada, which forms a communication between the\r\ntwo banks of the lake. At the distance of about half a league from the\r\nlake is a village, which, under the Spanish domination, was called\r\nReyes. Adjacent to it is the celebrated Pampa of Junin, which, on the\r\n24th of August, 1824, was the scene of a battle between the Spanish\r\nforces, commanded by General Canterac, and the insurgents, headed by Don\r\nSimon Bolivar. The result of this battle had an important influence on\r\nthe destiny of Peru. It is generally believed that treachery in the\r\nSpanish army threw the victory into the hands of the insurgents. A few\r\ndays prior to the battle Bolivar is said to have received, from the\r\nSpanish camp, a letter in cypher, which he transmitted for explanation\r\nto his minister, Monteagudo, in Cerro de Pasco. The answer received\r\nfrom the minister was, that the letter recommended Bolivar to attack\r\nthe enemy without a moment's delay, for that on the part of the\r\nSpaniards the victory was insured to him. The bearer of the letter is\r\nstill living, and he does not deny that he was in the secret of the\r\nwhole plot. The insurgents were victorious, and in commemoration of\r\ntheir triumph they gave to the village of Reyes, and to the whole\r\nprovince, the name of Junin, calling them after the plain on which the\r\nbattle was fought.\r\n\r\nFrom Junin, the road runs to the distance of eight leagues across a\r\ndifficult level height, to Cacas, a hamlet containing only a few\r\nhuts. From thence, it is continued three leagues further, through\r\nseveral narrow Quebradas, and finally terminates in the beautiful\r\nvalley of Tarma.\r\n\r\nMany of the Indians in the neighborhood of Cerro de Pasco, especially\r\nthose who dwell in the Puna, in the direction of Cacas, infest the roads\r\nfor the purpose of plunder. They conceal themselves behind the rocks,\r\nwhere they lie in wait for travellers, whom they severely wound, and\r\nsometimes even kill, by stones hurled from their slings. When great\r\nboyas occur in the mines of the Cerro, these roads are so unsafe that it\r\nis not prudent to travel, except in well-armed parties. The solitary\r\ntraveller who seeks a night's lodging in one of the Puna huts, exposes\r\nhimself to great peril; for the host not unfrequently assassinates his\r\nsleeping guest. Nor is there much greater security in villages, such as\r\nJunin and Carhuamayo. Only a few years ago, the bodies of three\r\ntravellers were found in the house of the Alcalde of Junin, the\r\nprincipal authority in the village. The travellers had sought shelter\r\nfor the night, and were inhumanly murdered. Every year persons known to\r\nhave been travelling in these parts, mysteriously disappear, and there\r\nis every reason to believe they have been murdered by the Indians. Many\r\nof these Indians are mine laborers, who, for their incorrigible\r\nturpitude, have been banished from the Cerro, and who live by pillage.\r\n\r\nI will close this chapter with a brief description of four-and-twenty\r\nhours which I passed during a journey in the wildest part of the Puna\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of January, 1840, having passed the night in the hut of a\r\nPuna shepherd, I awoke next morning at day-break. The sun was just\r\nbeginning to cast a light tinge of red on the snow-capped tops of the\r\nCordillera. Through the aperture in the roof of the hut, which served\r\nthe purpose of a chimney, there penetrated a feeble light, just\r\nsufficient to show the misery and poverty that prevailed in the interior\r\nof the habitation. I rose from the resting-place on which, only a few\r\nhours previously, I had stretched myself exhausted by cold and fatigue,\r\nand raising the cow-hide, which closed the doorway of the hut, I crept\r\nout to make preparations for the continuance of my journey.\r\n\r\nI saddled my mule, and put into one of the saddle-bags a small supply\r\nof food. Whilst I was thus engaged, one of those fierce little dogs\r\nwhich are domiciled in every Indian hut, slily watched my movements;\r\nand though he had rested at the foot of my bed during the night, yet he\r\nwas only prevented, by the repeated threats of his master, from making\r\nan attack upon me. My Indian host handed me my gun; I paid for my\r\nnight's lodging by a few reals and some paper cigars; and having asked\r\nhim to direct me on my way, I rode off whilst he was expressing his\r\ngratitude, and his kind wishes in the words, \"_Dios lo pague!_\"\r\n\r\nThe sky was overhung by a thick mist, and the snow which had fallen\r\nduring the night covered the ground as far as the eye could reach. On my\r\nway I met an old Indian woman driving her sheep. The bleating flock\r\nmoved slowly on, leaving a deep furrow in the snow, and seeming\r\nimpatient till the genial sun should dispel the mist and dissolve the\r\nwhite covering which overspread their scanty pasture. A little further\r\non I met the son of this same Indian shepherdess. He and his dog were\r\nbusily engaged in catching partridges, destined to be sold on the\r\nfollowing Sunday, in the nearest village.\r\n\r\nMy road lay along a gentle acclivity, interspersed with rocks and\r\nswamps, which often obliged me to make wide detours. The swamps (or as\r\nthe natives call them, _Attoladeros_) are dangerous enemies to\r\ntravellers in the Puna, who, with their horses and mules, sometimes\r\nsink into them and perish. Even in the most open parts of the country\r\nit is not easy to discern the swamps, and the ground often sinks\r\nbeneath the rider where he least expects it. At length the sun began to\r\ndisperse the mist, and the snow gradually melted beneath his burning\r\nrays. Inspired with new vigor, I took a survey of the wild solitude\r\naround me. I was now on one of the level heights, about 14,000 feet\r\nabove the sea. On both sides arose the high Cordillera summits crowned\r\nwith eternal ice; detached peaks here and there towering to the skies.\r\nBehind me lay, deep and deeper, the dark valleys of the lower mountain\r\nregions, which, with the scarcely discernible Indian villages, receded\r\nin the distance, till they blended with the line of the horizon. Before\r\nme stretched the immeasurable extent of the level heights, at intervals\r\nbroken by ridges of hills. It seemed as though here, in the snow plains\r\nof the Cordillera, Nature had breathed out her last breath. Here life\r\nand death meet together as it were to maintain the eternal struggle\r\nbetween being and annihilation.\r\n\r\nHow little life had the sun yet wakened around me! The dull yellow Puna\r\ngrass, scarcely the length of one's finger, blended its tint with the\r\ngreenish hue of the glaciers. Advancing further on my onward course, how\r\njoyfully I greeted as old acquaintance the purple gentiana and the\r\nbrown calceolaria! With what pleasure I counted the yellow blossoms of\r\nthe echino-cactus! and presently the sight of the ananas-cactus pictured\r\nin my mind all the luxuriance of the primeval forests. These cacti were\r\ngrowing amidst rushes and mosses and syngeneses, which the frost had\r\nchanged to a rusty brown hue. Not a butterfly fluttered in the rarefied\r\natmosphere; no fly nor winged insect of any kind was discernible. A\r\nbeetle or a toad creeping from their holes, or a lizard warming himself\r\nin the sun, are all that reward the search of the naturalist.\r\n\r\nAs I journeyed onward, animate life awakened in rich variety around me.\r\nBirds, few in species, but numerous in individuals, everywhere met my\r\nview. Herds of vicuñas approached me with curious gaze, and then on a\r\nsudden fled with the swiftness of the wind. In the distance I observed\r\nstately groups of huanacus turning cautiously to look at me, and then\r\npassing on. The Puna stag (_tarush_) slowly advanced from his lair in\r\nthe mountain recesses, and fixed on me his large, black, wondering eyes;\r\nwhilst the nimble rock rabbits (_viscachas_) playfully disported and\r\nnibbled the scanty herbage growing in the mountain crevices.\r\n\r\nI had wandered for some hours admiring the varieties of life in this\r\npeculiar alpine region, when I stumbled against a dead mule. The poor\r\nanimal had probably sunk beneath his burthen, and had been left by his\r\ndriver to perish of cold and hunger. My presence startled three\r\nvoracious condors, which were feeding on the dead carcass. These kings\r\nof the air proudly shook their crowned heads, and darted at me furious\r\nglances with their blood-red eyes. Two of them rose on their giant\r\nwings, and in narrowing circles hovered threateningly above my head,\r\nwhilst the third, croaking fiercely, kept guard over the booty. I\r\ncocked my gun in readiness for defence, and cautiously rode past the\r\nmenacing group, without the least desire of further disturbing their\r\nbanquet. These condors were the only hostile animals I encountered in\r\nthis part of the Puna.\r\n\r\nIt was now two o'clock in the afternoon, and I had ridden on a\r\ncontinuous though gradual ascent since sunrise. My panting mule\r\nslackened his pace, and seemed unwilling to mount a rather steep ascent\r\nwhich we had now arrived at. To relieve him I dismounted, and began\r\nwalking at a rapid pace. But I soon felt the influence of the rarefied\r\natmosphere, and I experienced an oppressive sensation which I had never\r\nknown before. I stood still for a few moments to recover myself, and\r\nthen tried to advance; but an indescribable oppression overcame me. My\r\nheart throbbed audibly; my breathing was short and interrupted. A\r\nworld's weight seemed to lie upon my chest; my lips swelled and burst;\r\nthe capillary vessels of my eyelids gave way, and blood flowed from\r\nthem. In a few moments my senses began to leave me. I could neither see,\r\nhear, nor feel distinctly. A grey mist floated before my eyes, and I\r\nfelt myself involved in that struggle between life and death which, a\r\nshort time before, I fancied I could discern on the face of nature. Had\r\nall the riches of earth, or the glories of heaven, awaited me a hundred\r\nfeet higher, I could not have stretched out my hand towards them.\r\n\r\nIn this half senseless state I lay stretched on the ground, until I felt\r\nsufficiently recovered to remount my mule. One of the Puna storms was\r\nnow gathering, thunder and lightning accompanied a heavy fall of snow,\r\nwhich very soon lay a foot deep on the ground. In a short time I\r\ndiscovered that I had missed my way. Had I then known the Puna as well\r\nas I afterwards did, I should have shaped my course by the flight of\r\nbirds. But unluckily I pursued the fresh track of a herd of vicuñas,\r\nwhich led me directly into a swamp. My mule sank, and was unable to\r\nextricate himself. I was almost in despair. Nevertheless, I cautiously\r\nalighted, and with incredible difficulty I succeeded in digging out with\r\na dagger the mud in which the animal's legs were firmly fixed, and at\r\nlength I got him back to a solid footing. After wandering about in\r\nvarious directions, I at length recovered the right path, which was\r\nmarked by numerous skeletons protruding above the snow. These were the\r\nremains of beasts of burthen, which had perished on their journeys; a\r\nwelcome, though an ominous guide to the wandering traveller. The clouds\r\nnow suddenly separated, and the blazing light of the tropical sun glared\r\ndazzlingly on the white plain of snow. In a moment I felt my eyes\r\nstricken with _surumpe_.\r\n\r\nSuffering the most violent pain, and tormented by the apprehension of\r\nblindness, I with great difficulty pursued my way. My mule could\r\nscarcely wade through the sward, which was becoming more and more\r\nthick; and night was advancing. I had lost all feeling in my feet, my\r\nbenumbed fingers could scarcely hold the bridle, and I well knew that\r\nthe nearest point at which I could obtain the shelter of a human\r\nhabitation was eight German miles distant. I was beginning to give\r\nmyself up for lost, when I observed a cave beneath an overhanging rock.\r\nMother Nature, in whose service I had undertaken my long and perilous\r\nwanderings, at that critical juncture, provided for me a retreat,\r\nthough in one of her rudest sheltering places. I entered the cave,\r\nwhich protected me securely against the wind and the snow. Having\r\nunsaddled my mule, I made a bed of my saddle clothes and poncho. I tied\r\nthe animal to a stone, and whilst he eagerly regaled himself with the\r\nlittle grass that was not buried beneath the snow, I satisfied my\r\nhunger with some roasted maize and cheese.\r\n\r\nExhausted by the fatigue of the day, I lay down to sleep; but no sooner\r\nhad I fallen into a slumber, than I was awaked by a violent smarting\r\nin my eyes, occasioned by the _surumpe_. There was no longer any hope\r\nof sleep. The night seemed endless. When the dawn of morning appeared,\r\nI made an effort to open my eyes, which were closed with coagulated\r\nblood. On looking around me I beheld all the horror of my situation. A\r\nhuman corpse had served for my pillow. Shuddering I went in search of\r\nmy mule, for I was eager to hurry from this dismal spot; but my misery\r\nwas not yet at an end. The poor beast lay dead on the ground; in his\r\nravenous hunger he had eaten of the poisonous _garbancillo_. What\r\ncould I do! In despair I turned back to the cave.\r\n\r\nThe sun had now fully risen, and his genial rays diffused warmth over\r\nthis frozen region. Somewhat roused by the reviving light and life\r\naround me, I began to examine the body of my lifeless companion. Haply,\r\nthought I, he may be one of my own race; a traveller who has perished\r\nof cold and hunger. No. He was a half-caste Indian, and many deadly\r\nwounds on his head showed that he had died of the slings of Indian\r\nrobbers, who had stripped him even of his clothes, and concealed the\r\nbody in the cave.\r\n\r\nI seized my gun and shot a rock rabbit, then collecting some fuel, I\r\nkindled a fire, and roasted the little animal, which afforded me a no\r\nvery savory breakfast. I then waited patiently in the hope that some\r\ntimely help would deliver me from my dreary situation.\r\n\r\nIt was about noon. I heard a monotonous short cry. With joy I\r\nrecognized the well-known sound. I climbed up the nearest rock, and\r\nlooking down into a hollow, I perceived two Indians whom I had seen the\r\nday before, driving their llamas to the nearest mine works. I prevailed\r\non them, by the gift of a little tobacco, to let me have one of their\r\nllamas to carry my luggage, and having strewed a few handfuls of earth\r\non the corpse of the murdered man, I departed. The scene of the\r\nincidents above described was the Cave of Leñas, in the Altos which\r\nlead southward to the Quebrada of Huaitara.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: A mine is said to be in _boya_ when it yields an\r\nunusually abundant supply of metal.

These valleys\r\nare called the Sierra. The inhabitants of Lima usually comprehend under\r\nthe term Sierra, the whole interior of Peru, and every Indian who is not\r\nan inhabitant of the coast, or of the forest regions, is called by them\r\na _Serrano_. But strictly speaking, the Sierra includes only the valleys\r\nbetween the Cordillera and the Andes, and I shall here use the term in\r\nits more limited and proper sense.\r\n\r\nIn the Sierra there are only two seasons throughout the year. The winter\r\nor rainy season commences in October; but the rains are neither so heavy\r\nnor so continuous as in the forest districts. The falls of rain seldom\r\nlast longer than two or three days in succession. Storms of thunder and\r\nlightning are very frequent in the Sierra; they are not accompanied by\r\nsnow as in the Puna, but often by hail. The thermometer never falls\r\nbelow +4° R., and during the daytime it is on the average at +11° R. In\r\nApril the summer season sets in, bringing with it an uninterrupted\r\nsuccession of warm bright days. The nights in summer are colder than in\r\nwinter. In a summer night the thermometer will sometimes fall below\r\nfreezing point, and the cold is often very severe. About noon the heat\r\nis oppressive, though the average heat of the day does not exceed 13, 9°\r\nR. During the summer season the horizon is frequently obscured by heavy\r\ndark clouds, which seldom break over the valleys, but continue frowning\r\nover the hills. The natives call these portentous clouds _Misti\r\nManchari_ (terror of the whites),[76] because the inhabitants of the\r\ncoast always regard them as indicative of stormy weather.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Sierra favors the natural fruitfulness of the soil,\r\nwhich richly repays the labor of the husbandman; but plants, peculiar to\r\nthe warm tropical regions, do not thrive well here. Prior to the\r\nEuropean emigration to Peru, only maize, quinua (_Chenopodium Quinoa_,\r\nL.), and a few tuberous roots were grown in the Sierra; but since the\r\nSpanish conquest, the European cereals, lucerne, and various kinds of\r\nvegetables are cultivated with perfect success. But the eye of the\r\ntraveller seeks in vain for those stately forests which clothe the\r\nmountainous districts of Europe; the barren acclivities afford nurture\r\nonly for the agave-tree, and some very large species of cactus. Groups\r\nof willow trees (_Salix Humboldtii_), which attain the height of about\r\ntwenty or twenty-five feet, together with the quinua-tree, form here and\r\nthere little thickets on the banks of rivers.\r\n\r\nThese regions, so favored by nature, have from the earliest period\r\nbeen the chosen dwelling-places of the Peruvians; and therefore in the\r\nSierra, which, measured by its superficies, is not of very great\r\nextent, the population has increased more than in any other part of\r\nPeru. The valleys already contain numerous towns, villages, and\r\nhamlets, which would rise in importance, if they had greater facility\r\nof communication one with another. But they are surrounded on all\r\nsides by mountains, which can be crossed only by circuitous and\r\ndangerous routes. The few accessible pathways are alternately up\r\nrugged ascents, and down steep declivities; or winding through narrow\r\nravines, nearly choked up by broken fragments of rock, they lead to\r\nthe dreary and barren level heights.\r\n\r\nThe Serranos, or inhabitants of the Sierra, especially those who dwell\r\nin the smaller villages, are chiefly Indians. In the towns and larger\r\nvillages, the mestizos are numerous. The whites are very thinly\r\nscattered over the Sierra; but many of the mestizos are very anxious to\r\nbe thought white Creoles. A rich serrano, who bears in his features the\r\nstamp of his Indian descent, will frequently try to pass himself off to\r\na foreigner for an old Spaniard. Here, even more than on the coast, the\r\nmestizo is ambitious to rank himself on a level with the white, whilst\r\nhe affects to regard the Indian as an inferior being.\r\n\r\nThe few Spaniards who reside in the Sierra are men who have served in\r\nthe Spanish army, and who, at the close of the war of independence,\r\nsettled in that part of Peru. Many of them keep shops in the towns and\r\nvillages, and others, by advantageous marriages, have become the\r\npossessors of haciendas. Those who have enriched themselves in this way\r\nare remarkable alike for ignorance and pride, and give themselves the\r\nmost ludicrous airs of assumed dignity. The Creoles are the principal\r\ndealers in articles of European commerce. They journey to Lima twice or\r\nthrice a year to make their purchases, which consist in white and\r\nprinted calicoes, woollen cloths, hard-wares, leather, soap, wax, and\r\nindigo. In the Sierra, indigo is a very considerable article of traffic:\r\nthe Indians use a great quantity of it for dyeing their clothes; blue\r\nbeing their favorite color. Wax is also in great demand; for in the\r\nreligious ceremonies, which are almost of daily occurrence, a vast\r\nquantity of tapers is consumed. The principal articles of traffic\r\nproduced by the natives are woollen ponchos and blankets, unspun colored\r\nwool, saddle-cloths, stirrups and horseshoes. The last-named articles\r\nare purchased chiefly by the arrieros of the coast. It may seem strange\r\nthat stores of horseshoes should be kept ready made; but so it is; for\r\nthough in Europe we make the shoe to fit the hoof, yet in Peru it is the\r\npractice to cut the hoof to fit the shoe. On Yca brandy more money is\r\nexpended than on every other article of trade combined. The quantity of\r\nthat spirit annually transported to the Sierra exceeds belief. To see\r\nthe Indians on Sundays and festival days thronging to the shops of the\r\nspirit dealers, with their jugs and bottles, one might fairly presume\r\nthat more brandy is drunk in the Sierra in one day, than in many of the\r\ntowns of Europe in a year. In some parts--for example, in the province\r\nof Jauja--hens' eggs are circulated as small coin, forty-eight or fifty\r\nbeing counted for a dollar. In the market-place and in the shops the\r\nIndians make most of their purchases with this brittle sort of money:\r\none will give two or three eggs for brandy, another for indigo, and a\r\nthird for cigars. These eggs are packed in boxes by the shop-keepers,\r\nand sent to Lima. From Jauja alone, several thousand loads of eggs are\r\nannually forwarded to the capital.\r\n\r\nMost of the mestizos possess little estates (_chacras_), the produce of\r\nwhich, consisting of grain, vegetables and clover, is disposed of in the\r\ntowns of the Sierra, or in the mining districts of the Puna. As the\r\nprofits arising from the chacras usually suffice to provide their owners\r\nwith a comfortable subsistence, the mestizos pass their lives in\r\nidleness and pleasure. They spend the chief portion of the day in the\r\ntrue Spanish style, gossiping in groups in the streets, and wrapped in\r\ntheir mantles. When the state of the weather does not admit of this sort\r\nof out-door lounging the time is passed in gaming or cock-fighting. This\r\nlatter diversion is no less in favor in the Sierra than in Lima. Such\r\nenormous bets are laid at these cock-fights, that the losses frequently\r\nentail ruin on persons of tolerably good fortune.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of the Sierra is wholly consigned to the Indians, who\r\neither cultivate their own lands, or for very poor wages labor for the\r\nmestizos. In September, the ground is ploughed and prepared for sowing,\r\nwhich operation is performed in October, and the reaping takes place in\r\nApril or May. By this means the seed is left in the ground throughout\r\nall the rainy season. In February violent frost frequently comes on\r\nduring the night, by which the seed is so much injured that the harvest\r\nfails, and the scarcity occasions severe suffering and even famine. When\r\nthe cold clear nights create apprehensions of damage to the seed, the\r\npeople form themselves into processions, and go through the villages\r\nand towns imploring the mercy of Heaven. In the dead of the night it is\r\nno unusual thing to be aroused by the ringing of bells. The inhabitants\r\nthen get up and hurry to church, where the solemn processions are\r\nformed. Penitents clothed in sackcloth go through the streets, scourging\r\nthemselves; and the Indians, in their native language, utter prayers and\r\noffer up vows to Heaven. For the space of some hours an incessant\r\nmovement and agitation pervade the streets, and when day begins to dawn\r\nthe people return to their homes, trembling between hope and fear. The\r\nfate of the Indians, when their harvest fails them, is indeed truly\r\nmiserable, for, abstemious as they are, they can scarcely procure\r\nwherewith to satisfy their hunger. In the year 1840, which was a period\r\nof scarcity, I saw the starving Indian children roaming about the\r\nfields, and eating the grass like cattle.\r\n\r\nMaize is the species of grain most extensively cultivated in the Sierra:\r\nit is of excellent quality, though smaller than that grown on the coast.\r\nWheat, though it thrives well, is cultivated only in a very limited\r\nquantity, and the bread made from it is exceedingly bad. The other\r\nspecies of European grain, barley excepted, are unknown to the Serranos.\r\nTo compensate for the want of them, they have the quinua (_Chenopodium\r\nQuinoa_, L.), which is at once a nutritious, wholesome, and pleasant\r\narticle of food. The leaves of this plant, before it attains full\r\nmaturity, are eaten like spinach; but it is the seeds which are most\r\ngenerally used as food. They are prepared in a variety of ways, but most\r\nfrequently boiled in milk or in broth, and sometimes cooked with cheese\r\nand Spanish pepper. The dried stems of the quinua are used as fuel.\r\nExperiments in the cultivation of this plant have been tried in some\r\nparts of Germany, and with considerable success. It would appear,\r\nhowever, that its flavor is not much liked; a circumstance rather\r\nsurprising to the traveller who has tasted it in Peru, where it is\r\nregarded in the light of a delicacy. It were to be wished that the\r\ngeneral cultivation of the quinua could be introduced throughout Europe;\r\nfor during the prevalence of the potatoe disease this plant would be\r\nfound of the greatest utility. It is a well-known fact that potatoes and\r\ntea, two articles now in such universal use, were not liked on their\r\nfirst introduction into Europe. The quinua plant, which yields a\r\nwholesome article of food, would thrive perfectly in our hemisphere,\r\nand, though in its hitherto limited trial it has not found favor, there\r\nis no reason to conclude that it may not at a future time become an\r\nobject of general consumption.\r\n\r\nFour kinds of tuberous plants are successfully cultivated in the Sierra;\r\nviz., the potatoe, the ulluco, the oca, and the mashua. Of potatoes\r\nthere are several varieties, and all grow in perfection. The ulluco\r\n(_Tropæolum tuberosum_) is smaller than the potatoe, and is very various\r\nin its form, being either round, oblong, straight, or curved. The skin\r\nis thin, and of a reddish-yellow color, and the inside is green. When\r\nsimply boiled in water it is insipid, but is very savory when cooked as\r\na _picante_. The oca (_Oxalis tuberosa_) is an oval-shaped root; the\r\nskin pale red, and the inside white. It is watery, and has a sweetish\r\ntaste; for which reason it is much liked by the Peruvians. The mashua is\r\nthe root of a plant as yet unknown to botanists. It is cultivated and\r\ncooked in the same manner as those already described. In form, however,\r\nit differs from them all. It is of a flat pyramidal shape, and the lower\r\nend terminates in a fibrous point. It is watery, and insipid to the\r\ntaste; but is nevertheless much eaten by the Serranos. As the mashua\r\nroots will not keep, they are not transported from the places in which\r\nthey are grown, and, therefore, are not known in Lima. The Indians use\r\nthe mashua as a medicine: they consider it an efficacious remedy in\r\ncases of dropsy, indigestion, and dysentery.\r\n\r\nThe vegetables and fruits of Europe thrive luxuriantly in the warm\r\nSierra valleys; yet but few of them have been transplanted thither, and\r\nthose few are but little esteemed. Some of the cabbage and salad\r\nspecies, together with onions, garlic, and several kinds of pulse, are\r\nall that are cultivated. It is remarkable that in these regions no\r\nindigenous fruit-trees are to be seen. The only fruit really belonging\r\nto the Sierra is the Tuna. In some of the sheltered ravines, or, as they\r\nare called, Quebradas, oranges, lemons, and granadillas flourish at the\r\nheight of 10,000 feet above sea level. The fruits which have been\r\ntransplanted from Europe are for the most part indifferent, as not the\r\nleast care is bestowed on their cultivation. The effect of this neglect\r\nis particularly obvious in apples, pears, and damson-plums. Cherries and\r\nchestnuts are unknown in these parts; but on the other hand, peaches and\r\napricots (_duraznos_) grow in amazing abundance, and many very fine\r\nspecies are found, especially in the southern provinces. Excursions to\r\nthe _duraznales_ (apricot gardens), in the months of April and May, to\r\neat the ripe fruit fresh plucked from the trees, are among the most\r\nfavorite recreations of the Serranos. Some of the Sierra districts are\r\ncelebrated throughout Peru for their abundance of fruit. This luxuriance\r\nis particularly remarkable in several of the deep valleys, for instance,\r\nin Huanta; but, strictly speaking, these deep valleys partake less of\r\nthe character of the Sierra than of the higher forest regions.\r\n\r\nThe periods of sowing and reaping are celebrated by the Indians with\r\nmerry-making, a custom which has descended from the time of the Incas,\r\nwhen those periods corresponded with the two great divisions of the\r\nyear. Even a scanty harvest, an event of frequent occurrence, occasions\r\nno interruption to these rustic festivals. Bands of music, consisting of\r\ntrumpets, fiddles, and flutes, play whilst the corn is cut down, and\r\nduring their work, the laborers freely regale themselves with chicha,\r\nhuge barrels of which are placed for their unrestrained use. The\r\nconsequence is, that they are almost continually intoxicated; and yet\r\nwhilst in this state it is no unusual thing to see them dancing with\r\nheavy loads of sheaves on their heads. Their dinner is cooked in the\r\nfields, in large pots and kettles, and to partake of it they all sit\r\ndown on the ground in rows, one behind another. The wheat and barley\r\nwhen cut are spread out in little heaps on the ground, and, instead of\r\nthrashing, the grain is pressed out of the ears by the tramping of\r\nhorses, the animals being driven round and round in a circle. As soon as\r\nthis process is ended, the agents of the Government and the priests make\r\ntheir appearance to claim the tithes.\r\n\r\nIn the larger villages and towns of the Sierra, the Indians frequently\r\nemploy themselves in handicrafts, in some of which they attain a high\r\ndegree of perfection, for they are not wanting either in talent or in\r\nmechanical dexterity. As goldsmiths they are remarkably skilful, and in\r\nthis branch of industry they produce work which, for taste and\r\nexquisite finish, cannot be excelled in the capitals of Europe. The\r\nvarious kinds of vessels and figures of silver wire (_filigranas_), made\r\nby the cholos in Ayacucho, have always been favorite articles of\r\nornament in Spain. The Indians of Jauja are very skilful in working\r\niron, and the objects of their workmanship are much esteemed throughout\r\nPeru. Of leather also they make various things in very beautiful style;\r\nand saddle-cloths, bridles, &c., of their manufacture are much more\r\nelegant and infinitely cheaper than those made in Lima. In Cuzco and the\r\nadjacent provinces many of the Indians evince considerable talent in\r\noil-painting. Their productions in this way are, of course, far from\r\nbeing master-pieces; but when we look on the paintings which decorate\r\ntheir churches, and reflect that the artists have been shut out from the\r\nadvantages of education and study; and moreover, when we consider the\r\ncoarse materials with which the pictures have been painted, it must be\r\nacknowledged that they indicate a degree of talent, which, if duly\r\ncultivated, would soar far above mediocrity. In Tarma and its\r\nneighborhood the natives weave an exquisitely fine description of\r\nwoollen cloth. They make ponchos of vicuña wool, which sell for 100 or\r\n120 dollars each, and which are equal to the finest European cloth.\r\nThe beauty of these Indian textures is truly wonderful, considering\r\nthe rude process of weaving practised by the natives. They work\r\nvarious colors, figures, and inscriptions in the cloth, and do all\r\nthis with a rapidity which equals the operations of ordinary looms.\r\nThe most valuable textures they weave are those produced from the wool\r\nof the vicuña and the alpaco. They likewise make very fine textures of\r\ncotton and silk. It is curious that the Indians of each province have\r\nsome particular branch of industry to which they exclusively apply\r\nthemselves, to the neglect of all others.\r\n\r\nThe Serranos are a very sociable people. In the towns they keep up a\r\ncontinual round of evening parties, in which singing and dancing are\r\nfavorite amusements; but on these occasions they indulge in\r\nbrandy-drinking to a terrible excess. As soon as a party is assembled,\r\nbottles and glasses are introduced, and each individual, ladies as well\r\nas gentlemen, drinks to the health of the company. For a party of thirty\r\nor more persons, not more than three or four glasses are brought in, so\r\nthat one glass is passed repeatedly from hand to hand, and from mouth to\r\nmouth. The quantity of brandy drunk at one of the evening parties called\r\nin the Sierra _Jaranas_, is almost incredible. According to my\r\nobservation, I should say that a bottle to each individual, ladies\r\nincluded, is a fair average estimate, the bottles being of the size of\r\nthose used in Europe for claret. In the year 1839, whilst I was residing\r\nfor a time in one of the largest towns of the Sierra, a ball was given\r\nin honor of the Chilian General Bulnes; on that occasion the brandy\r\nflowed in such quantities, that, when morning came, some members of the\r\ncompany were found lying on the floor of the ball-room in a state of\r\nintoxication. These facts naturally create an impression very\r\nunfavorable to the inhabitants of the Sierra; but a due allowance must\r\nbe made for the want of education and the force of habit on the part of\r\nthose who fall into these excesses. These people possess so many\r\nexcellent moral qualities, that it would be unjust to condemn them\r\nsolely on account of these orgies. The Serrano is far from being\r\naddicted to habitual drunkenness, notwithstanding his intemperate use of\r\nstrong drinks amidst the excitement of company.\r\n\r\nBut if the vice of excessive drinking be occasionally indulged in among\r\nthe better class of people of the Sierra, it is much more frequent among\r\nthe Indian inhabitants. Every one of their often-recurring festivals is\r\ncelebrated by a drinking bout, at which enormous quantities of brandy\r\nand chicha are consumed. In some districts of the Sierra the chicha is\r\nprepared in a peculiar and very disgusting manner by the Indians.\r\nInstead of crushing the _jora_ (dried maize-grain) between two stones,\r\nwhich is the usual method, the Indians bruise it with their teeth. For\r\nthis purpose a group of men and women range themselves in a circle round\r\na heap of _jora_; each gathers up a handful, chews it, and then ejects\r\nit from the mouth into a vessel allotted for its reception. This mass,\r\nafter being boiled in water, and left to ferment, is the much admired\r\n_chicha mascada_ (that is to say, _chewed chicha_), the flavor of which\r\nis said to surpass that of the same beverage made in any other way. But\r\nthey who have been eye-witnesses of the disgusting process, and who bear\r\nin mind various other preparations of Indian cookery in which the teeth\r\nperform a part, require some fortitude ere they yield to the pressing\r\ninvitation of the hospitable Serrano, and taste the proffered nectar.\r\n\r\nWhen it is wished to make the chicha particularly strong and well\r\nflavored, it is poured into an earthen jar along with several pounds of\r\nbeef. This jar is made perfectly air-tight, and buried several feet deep\r\nin the ground, where it is left for the space of several years. On the\r\nbirth of a child it is customary to bury a _botija_ full of chicha,\r\nwhich, on the marriage of the same child, is opened and drunk. This\r\nchicha has a very agreeable flavor, but is so exceedingly potent, that a\r\nsingle glass of it is sufficient to intoxicate a practised\r\nchicha-drinker, or, as they say in the country, a _chichero_.\r\n\r\nEvery village in the Sierra has its own tutelary saint, whose festival\r\nis celebrated with great solemnity. Bull-fights and dances constitute\r\nthe principal diversions on these occasions. These dances are relics of\r\nthe _Raymí_ or monthly dances, by which the Incas used to mark the\r\ndivisions of time; and they are among the most interesting customs\r\npeculiar to these parts of Peru. The dancers wear dresses similar to\r\nthose worn by the ancient Peruvians when they took part in the _Raymí_.\r\nTheir faces and arms are painted in various colors, and they wear\r\nfeather caps and feather ponchos. They have bracelets and anklets, and\r\nthey are armed with clubs, wooden swords, and bows and arrows. Their\r\nmusic, too, is also similar to that of their forefathers. Their\r\ninstruments consist of a sort of pipe or flute made of reed, and a drum\r\ncomposed simply of a hoop with a skin stretched upon it. To the\r\ninharmonious sound of these instruments, accompanying monotonous Quichua\r\nsongs, the dances commence with those solemn movements with which the\r\nIncas used to worship the sun: they then suddenly assume a more joyous\r\ncharacter, and at last change to the wild war-dance, in which the mimic\r\ncontest, stimulated by copious libations of chicha, frequently ends in a\r\nreal fight. In the larger towns, where the Mestizo portion of the\r\npopulation predominates, these dances are discouraged, and in course of\r\ntime they will probably be entirely discontinued, though they are\r\nscrupulously adhered to by the Indians.\r\n\r\nOn festival days, bull-fights constitute the most favorite popular\r\ndiversion. In the Sierra this barbarous sport is conducted with even\r\nmore recklessness and cruelty than in the _Corridas_ of Lima. Every\r\noccasion on which an entertainment of this sort takes place is attended\r\nwith loss of life, and sometimes the sacrifice both of men and horses is\r\nvery considerable. During my residence in Jauja, fourteen Indians and\r\nnineteen horses were killed or seriously wounded in a bull-fight; yet\r\ncatastrophes of this kind appear to make no impression on the people.\r\n\r\nSome of the church festivals are celebrated by the Indians of the\r\nSierra, in a manner which imparts a peculiar coloring to the religious\r\nsolemnities. In the midnight mass on Christmas Eve, they imitate in the\r\nchurches the sounds made by various animals. The singing of birds, the\r\ncrowing of cocks, the braying of asses, the bleating of sheep, &c., are\r\nsimulated so perfectly, that a stranger is inclined to believe that the\r\nanimals have assembled in the temple to participate in the solemnity. At\r\nthe termination of the mass, troops of women perambulate the streets,\r\nduring the remainder of the night. Their long black hair flows loosely\r\nover their bare shoulders; and in their hands they carry poles with\r\nlong fluttering strips of paper fixed to the ends of them. They\r\noccasionally dance and sing peculiarly beautiful melodies, accompanied\r\nby a harp, a fiddle, and a flute; and they mark the measure of the\r\nmusic by the movement of their poles.\r\n\r\nThe celebration of Christmas-day is marked by the appearance of what are\r\ntermed the _Negritos_. These are Indians, with their faces concealed by\r\nhideous negro masks. Their dress consists of a loose red robe, richly\r\nwrought with gold and silver thread, white pantaloons, and their hats\r\nare adorned with waving black feathers. In their hands they carry gourd\r\nbottles, painted in various gay colors, and containing dried seeds.\r\nWhilst they sing, the _Negritos_ shake these gourds, and mark the time\r\nby the rattling of the dried seeds. They perform the dances of the\r\nGuinea negroes, and imitate the attitudes and language of a race which\r\nthey hold in abhorrence and contempt. For the space of three days and\r\nnights these negritos parade the streets, entering the houses and\r\ndemanding chicha and brandy, with which the inhabitants are glad to\r\nsupply them, to avoid violence and insult.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day other groups of mummers, called _Corcobados_,\r\nperambulate the streets. They are enveloped in cloaks of coarse grey\r\nwoollen cloth, their head-gear consists of an old vicuña hat, with a\r\nhorse's tail dangling behind. Their features are disguised by ludicrous\r\nmasks with long beards; and, bestriding long sticks or poles, they move\r\nabout accompanied by burlesque music. Every remarkable incident that has\r\noccurred in the families of the town during the course of the year, is\r\nmade the subject of a song in the Quichua language; and these songs are\r\nsung in the streets by the _Corcobados_. Matrimonial quarrels are\r\nfavorite subjects, and are always painted with high comic effect in\r\nthese satirical songs. The Corcobados go about for two days; and they\r\nusually wind up their performances by drinking and fighting. When two\r\ngroups of these Corcobados meet together, and the one party assails with\r\nridicule anything which the other is disposed to defend, a terrible\r\naffray usually ensues, and the sticks which have served as hobby-horses,\r\nare converted into weapons of attack.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the conversion of the idolatrous Indians, the\r\nSpanish monks who accompanied Pizarro's army, sought to render the\r\nChristian religion as attractive as possible in the eyes of the heathen\r\naborigines of Peru. With this view they conceived the idea of\r\ndramatizing certain scenes in the life of Christ, and having them\r\nrepresented in the churches. In the larger towns these performances have\r\nlong since been discontinued, but they are still kept up in most of the\r\nvillages of the Sierra; indeed the efforts made by enlightened\r\necclesiastics for their suppression, have been met with violent\r\nopposition on the part of the Indians.\r\n\r\nOn Palm Sunday, an image of the Saviour seated on an ass is paraded\r\nabout the principal streets of the town or village. The Indians strew\r\ntwigs of palm over the animal, and contend one with another for the\r\nhonor of throwing their ponchos down on the ground, in order that the\r\nass may walk over them. The animal employed in this ceremony is, when\r\nvery young, singled out for the purpose, and is never suffered to carry\r\nany burthen save the holy image. He is fed by the people, and at every\r\ndoor at which he stops, the inmates of the house pamper him up with the\r\nbest fodder they can procure. The ass is looked upon as something almost\r\nsacred, and is never named by any other appellation than the _Burro de\r\nNuestro Señor_ (our Lord's ass). In some villages I have seen these\r\nanimals so fat that they were scarcely able to walk.\r\n\r\nGood Friday is solemnized in a manner the effect of which, to the\r\nunprejudiced foreigner, is partly burlesque and partly seriously\r\nimpressive. From the early dawn of morning the church is thronged with\r\nIndians, who spend the day in fasting and prayer. At two in the\r\nafternoon a large image of the Saviour is brought from the sacristy and\r\nlaid down in front of the altar. Immediately all the persons in the\r\nchurch rush forward with pieces of cotton to touch the wounds. This\r\ngives rise to a struggle, in which angry words and blows are\r\ninterchanged; in short, there ensues a disgraceful scene of uproar,\r\nwhich is only checked by the interposition of one of the priests. Order\r\nbeing restored, the sacred image is fixed on the cross by three very\r\nlarge silver nails, and the head is encircled by a rich silver crown. On\r\neach side are the crosses of the two thieves. Having gaped at this\r\nspectacle to their hearts' content, the cholos retire from the church.\r\nAt eight in the evening they reassemble to witness the solemn ceremony\r\nof taking down the Saviour from the cross. The church is then\r\nbrilliantly lighted up. At the foot of the cross stand four white-robed\r\npriests, called _los Santos Varones_ (the holy men), whose office it is\r\nto take down the image. At a little distance from them, on a sort of\r\nstage or platform, stands a figure representing the Virgin Mary. This\r\nfigure is dressed in black, with a white cap on its head. A priest, in a\r\nlong discourse, explains the scene to the assembled people, and at the\r\nclose of the address, turning to the Santos Varones, he says, \"Ye holy\r\nmen, ascend the ladders of the cross, and bring down the body of the\r\nRedeemer!\" Two of the Santos Varones mount with hammers in their hands,\r\nand the priest then says, \"Ye holy man, on the right of the Saviour,\r\nstrike the first blow on the nail of the hand, and take it out!\" The\r\ncommand is obeyed, and no sooner is the stroke of the hammer heard, than\r\ndeep groans and sounds of anguish resound through the church; whilst the\r\ncry of \"_Misericordia! misericordia!_\" repeated by a thousand imploring\r\nvoices, produces an indescribable sensation of awe and melancholy. The\r\nnail is handed to one of the priests standing at the foot of the altar,\r\nwho transfers it to another, and this one in his turn presents it to the\r\nfigure of the Virgin. To that figure the priest then turns and addresses\r\nhimself, saying: \"Thou afflicted mother, approach and receive the nail\r\nwhich pierced the right hand of thy holy Son!\" The priest steps forward\r\na few paces, and the figure, by some concealed mechanism, advances to\r\nmeet him, receives the nail with both hands, lays it on a silver plate,\r\ndries its eyes, and then returns to its place in the middle of the\r\nplatform. The same ceremony is repeated when the two other nails are\r\ntaken out. Throughout the whole performance of these solemnities, an\r\nuninterrupted groaning and howling is kept up by the Indians, who at\r\nevery stroke of the hammer raise their cries of _Misericordia!_ These\r\nsounds of anguish reach their climax when the priest consigns the body\r\nof the Saviour to the charge of the Virgin. The image is laid in a\r\ncoffin tastefully adorned with flowers, which, together with the figure\r\nof the Virgin Mary, is paraded through the streets. Whilst this\r\nnocturnal procession, lighted by thousands of wax tapers, is making the\r\ncircuit of the town, a party of Indians busy themselves in erecting\r\nbefore the church door twelve arches decorated with flowers. Between\r\nevery two of the arches they lay flowers on the ground, arranging them\r\nin various figures and designs. These flower-carpets are singularly\r\ningenious and pretty. Each one is the work of two cholos, neither of\r\nwhom seems to bestow any attention to what his comrade is doing; and\r\nyet, with a wonderful harmony of operation, they create the most\r\ntasteful designs--arabesques, animals, and landscapes, which grow, as it\r\nwere by magic, under their hands. Whilst I was in Tarma, I was at once\r\ninterested and astonished to observe on one of these flower-carpets the\r\nfigure of the Austrian double eagle. On inquiry I learned from an Indian\r\nthat it had been copied from the quicksilver jars, exported from Idria\r\nto Peru. On the return of the procession to the church, a hymn, with\r\nharp accompaniment, is sung to the Virgin, as the figure is carried\r\nunder the arches of flowers. The bier of the Saviour is then deposited\r\nin the church, where it is watched throughout the night.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, at four o'clock, the ceremony of hanging Judas\r\ntakes place in front of the church. A figure of Judas, the size of\r\nlife, is filled with squibs and crackers, and is frequently made to bear\r\na resemblance to some obnoxious inhabitant of the place. After the match\r\nis applied to the combustible figure, the cholos dance around it, and\r\nexult in the blowing up of their enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the Sierra, as well as on the coast, the priests are usually the\r\ntyrants rather than the guardians of their flocks; and they would\r\nfrequently be the objects of hatred and vengeance but for the\r\ndeep-rooted and almost idolatrous reverence which the Indians cherish\r\nfor priestcraft. It is disgusting to see the Peruvian priests, who\r\nusually treat the Indians like brutes, behaving with the most degrading\r\nservility when they want to get money from them. The love of the Indians\r\nfor strong drinks is a vice which the priests turn to their own\r\nadvantage. For the sake of the fees they frequently order religious\r\nfestivals, which are joyfully hailed by the Indians, because they never\r\nfail to end in drinking bouts.\r\n\r\nAdded to the ill treatment of the priests, the Indians are most unjustly\r\noppressed by the civil authorities. In the frequent movements of troops\r\nfrom one place to another, they are exposed to great losses and\r\nvexations. They are compelled to perform the hardest duties without\r\npayment, and often the produce of their fields is laid under\r\ncontribution, or their horses and mules are pressed into the service of\r\nthe military. When intelligence is received of the march of a battalion,\r\nthe natives convey their cattle to some remote place of concealment in\r\nthe mountains, for they seldom recover possession of them if once they\r\nfall into the hands of the soldiery.\r\n\r\nEvery fortnight a mail is despatched with letters from Lima to Tarma,\r\nJauja, Huancavelica, Ayacucha, Cuzco, and into Bolivia; another\r\nproceeds to the northern provinces; a third to Arequipa and the\r\nsouthern provinces; and every week one is despatched to Cerro de\r\nPasco. In Lima, the letter-bag is consigned to the charge of an\r\nIndian, who conveys it on the back of a mule to the next station,[77]\r\nwhere it is received by another Indian; and in this manner, handed\r\nfrom cholo to cholo, the letter-bag traverses the whole of its\r\ndestined route, unaccompanied by an official courier. As soon as the\r\nmail arrives at a station, a flag is displayed at the house of the\r\npost-master, to intimate to those who expect letters that they may\r\nreceive them; for they are not sent round to the persons to whom they\r\nare addressed, and it is sometimes even a favor to get them three or\r\nfour days after their arrival. The Peruvian post is as tardy as it is\r\nill-regulated. On one of my journeys, I started from Lima two days\r\nafter the departure of the mail. On the road I overtook and passed the\r\nIndian who had charge of the letters, and, without hurrying myself, I\r\narrived in Tarma a day and a half before him. Ascending the\r\nCordillera, I once met an Indian very leisurely driving his ass before\r\nhim with the mail-bag fastened to its back. Between the towns which do\r\nnot lie in the regular line of route, there is no post-office\r\ncommunication; for example, between Pasco and Caxamarca, or between\r\nPasco and Tarma, or Jauja; and when it is wished to despatch letters\r\nfrom one to another of these towns, private messengers must be\r\nemployed. The consequence is, that business, which in Europe would be\r\nconducted through the medium of correspondence, can be arranged only\r\nby personal communication in Peru. Travelling is difficult, but not\r\nvery expensive, as every one possesses horses or mules.\r\n\r\nThe best mules employed in the Sierra are obtained from the province\r\nof Tucuman in Buenos Ayres. Formerly the arrieros used annually to\r\nbring droves of several thousand mules through Bolivia and the\r\nPeruvian Sierra, selling as many as they could on the way, and taking\r\nto Cerro de Pasco those that remained unsold. During the Spanish\r\ndomination, the mule trade was in the hands of the Government, to\r\nwhose agents it afforded ample opportunity for the exercise of\r\ninjustice and extortion. It was one of the most oppressive of the\r\n_repartimientos_.[78] Every Indian was compelled to purchase a mule,\r\nand was not allowed even the privilege of choosing the animal. The\r\nmules were distributed by the authorities, and were tied to the doors\r\nof the houses for whose occupants they were destined. After the\r\ndistribution of the mules, a collector went round to receive the\r\npayment. During the war in Buenos Ayres the traffic in mules suffered\r\nvery considerably. For the space of twelve years not a mule had been\r\nbrought from that part of South America to Peru, when in 1840 the\r\nTucumanians revisited the Sierra with their droves of mules. They were\r\njoyfully welcomed by the Serranos, who gave good prices for the\r\nanimals, and since then the traffic has begun to revive.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the characteristic features of the Sierra, I have as far as\r\npossible confined myself to generalities, and I will not now weary the\r\nreader by entering upon a minute description of particular towns and\r\nvillages. All are built pretty nearly after one model. The large\r\nquadrangular Plaza is closed on three of its sides with buildings, among\r\nwhich there is always the Government house (_cabildo_), and the public\r\njail; the fourth side is occupied by a church. From this Plaza run in\r\nstraight lines eight streets, more or less broad, and these streets are\r\ncrossed at right angles by others; all presenting the same uniformity as\r\nin Lima. The houses are roomy, surrounded by court-yards, and consist of\r\na ground-floor and a story above, but very frequently of the\r\nground-floor only. The walls are of brick, and the roofs are tiled.\r\nThe churches are in very bad taste, with the exception of a few in the\r\nlarger towns, which have a good appearance externally, and are richly\r\ndecorated within. The smaller Indian villages are poor and dirty, and\r\nare built with little attention to regularity. But even in them the\r\nquadrangular Plaza is never wanting, and at least four straight\r\nstreets issue from it.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra is by far the most populous part of Peru. The banks of the\r\nrivers flowing through the fertile valleys are thickly clustered with\r\nvillages, which give a peculiar charm to the landscape, doubly pleasing\r\nto the eye of the traveller who comes from the barren parts of the\r\ncountry. The cultivated lands afford evidence of progressive\r\nimprovement, and it is easy to imagine the flourishing condition to\r\nwhich this country might arrive with increased population.\r\n\r\nFrom the Sierra two separate roads lead to the eastern declivity of the\r\nAndes. One lies along the banks of the mountain rivers, and the other\r\npasses over the ridges of the mountains. The first way is very\r\ndifficult, and scarcely practicable, for in some parts the streams flow\r\nthrough narrow ravines, bordered on each side by perpendicular rocks,\r\nand occasionally their course is hidden amidst impenetrable forests. The\r\nother way, across the mountains, leads again into the Puna region, and\r\nfrom thence over the steep ridges of the Andes to their barren summits.\r\nDescending from these summits, we arrive on the sharp ridges of one of\r\nthe many side branches of the Puna Cordillera, which run eastward. The\r\nPeruvians call these sharp mountain ridges _Cuchillas_ (knives). After\r\ncrossing the Andes, and descending a few hundred feet lower, in the\r\ndirection of the east, the traveller beholds a country totally different\r\nfrom that which he left on the western declivity of the mountains. On\r\nthe eastern side the soil is richly covered with vegetation. From the\r\ncuchillas the road ascends to some higher ridges, crowned with stunted\r\ntrees and brushwood, which, gradually spreading upward, blend with the\r\nhigh forests. These wooded ridges are called by the natives _Ceja de la\r\nMontaña_ (the mist of the mountains). In these regions the climate is\r\ngenerally more mild than in the Sierra, for the mercury never falls to\r\nfreezing point, and in the middle part of the day it never rises so\r\nhigh as in the warm Sierra valleys. Throughout the whole year the\r\n_Ceja de la Montaña_ is overshadowed by thick mists, rising from the\r\nrivers in the valleys. In the dry season these mists are absorbed by\r\nthe sun's rays, but in winter they float in thick clouds over the\r\nhills, and discharge themselves in endless torrents of rain. The damp\r\nvapors have an injurious effect on the health of the inhabitants of\r\nthese districts, which are, however, very thinly populated, as the\r\nconstant moisture unfits the soil for the cultivation of anything\r\nexcept potatoes. The pure alpine air of the Puna is preferred by the\r\nIndians to the vapory atmosphere of the Ceja.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: The Indians apply the designation _Misti_, meaning\r\n_Mestizo_, to all persons except Indians or Negroes, whether they be\r\nEuropeans or White Creoles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: The distance from one station to another varies from six\r\nto twelve miles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: _Repartimientos_ (literally, distributions) were the\r\ncompulsory sale of articles by the provincial authorities.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nRoad to the Primeval Forests--Barbacoas, or Indian Suspension\r\nBridges--Vegetation--Hollow Passes--Zoology--the\r\nMontaña--Plantations--Inhabitants--Trade in Peruvian Bark--Wandering\r\nIndians--Wild Indians or Indios Bravos--Languages, Manners, and\r\nCustoms of the Indios Bravos--Dress--Warlike Weapons and Hunting\r\nArms--Dwellings--Religion--Physical formation of the Wild Indian\r\nTribes--Animals of the Aboriginal Forests--Mammalia--Hunting the\r\nOunce--Birds--Amphibia--Poisonous Serpents--Huaco--Insects--Plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Ceja de la Montaña, we will trace the route to the Aboriginal\r\nforests, which extend eastwardly from the bases of the Andes. The whole\r\nplain is overspread by a thick veil of mist, which does not disperse\r\nuntil about noon, and then an undulating dark green canopy clouds the\r\nvapory atmosphere. A European, whose heart throbs at the bare idea of\r\none of those vast virgin forests, gazes anxiously forward on the\r\nboundless distance, and finds the pace of his cautious mule too tardy\r\nfor his impatient hopes and wishes. He beholds in perspective the goal\r\nof his long journey. Nature, in all her virginal freshness and grandeur,\r\nopens to his astonished eyes, and he feels a sensation of delight he\r\nnever before experienced. Regardless of present toil and danger, he sees\r\nonly the pleasure to come. But he is soon drawn back to cool reality,\r\nand is forcibly reminded of the truth, that every enjoyment must be\r\nearned by labor. The road is broken, narrow, and steep; over the woody\r\nsides of the hill it is easily passable; but as soon as it begins to\r\ndescend, it presents all those difficulties which have been\r\ninterestingly described by the early travellers in Peru. The scanty\r\npopulation of the surrounding districts, the native listlessness of the\r\nIndians, and their indifference to the conveniences of life, are\r\nobstacles to the making of roads which might be passable without\r\ndifficulty and danger. However, where nature from the state of the\r\ncountry has compelled man to establish a communication, it is executed\r\nin the most rude and unsatisfactory manner. A most decided proof of this\r\nis apparent in the bridges called _barbacoas_, which are constructed\r\nwhere the way is through a _derumbo_, or a small narrow mountain-pass,\r\nor where there is an obstruction caused by a rock which cannot be passed\r\ncircuitously. The barbacoas are constructed in the following manner.\r\nStakes from three to three and a half feet long are driven into the\r\nground, or into the crevices of rocks. Over the ends of these stakes are\r\nfastened strong branches of trees, the interstices are filled up with\r\nmud, and the whole is covered by a sort of matting composed of plaited\r\nbranches and reeds. If the ground admits of it, which is seldom the\r\ncase, a pile of stones is built up beneath the barbacoa, extending to at\r\nleast one half its breadth. When it is considered that there is,\r\nprobably, on the one side of this bridge, a rock inclining at a very\r\nacute angle, or an almost perpendicular declivity of a hill of loose\r\nearth, and that on the other side there yawns a deep abyss against which\r\nthere is not the least protection, the traveller may well be pardoned if\r\nhe shudders as he passes over the creaking and shaking barbacoa. These\r\nfragile bridges are often so much worn, that the feet of the mules slip\r\nthrough the layers of mud and reeds, and whilst making efforts to\r\ndisengage themselves, the animals fall over the edge of the barbacoa,\r\nand are hurled into the chasm below, dragging down the crazy structure\r\nalong with them. In consequence of these accidents, the way is often for\r\nweeks, or even months, impassable.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of these rude bridges, I observed that the Indians,\r\nin their simplicity, always faithfully copy their great instructress,\r\nnature. The majority of the plants growing in these regions belong, if I\r\nmay use the expression, to an aërial vegetation. The small, gnarled,\r\nlow-branched trees, have often scarcely one half of their roots in the\r\nearth: the other half spreads over the surface of the soil; then winding\r\nround the roots or branches of some neighboring plant, fastens on it,\r\nand intimately uniting with it, forms a kind of suspension bridge, over\r\nwhich the intertwining of numerous luxuriant climbing plants makes a\r\nstrong, impenetrable network. All the trees and shrubs are covered with\r\ninnumerable parasites, which, in the higher regions, are met with in\r\ntheir smaller forms, as lichens, mosses, &c.; but lower down, in the\r\ncourse of the various transformations they undergo, they appear in\r\nlarger development.\r\n\r\nThe whole vegetable kingdom here is stamped by a peculiar character. It\r\npresents immense fulness and luxuriance: it spreads widely, with but\r\nlittle upward development, rising on the average only a few feet above\r\nthe earth. Trees, shrubs, and tendrils, in endless complication of\r\ncolor, entwine together, sometimes fostering, sometimes crushing each\r\nother. Out of the remains of the dead arises a new generation, with an\r\nincrease of vital impulse. It seems as though the ice-crowned Andes\r\nlooked down with envy on the luxuriant vegetation of the forests, and\r\nsought to blight it by sending down cold, nightly winds. The low\r\ntemperature of the night counteracts that extreme development which\r\nthe humidity of the soil and the great heat of the day promote. But\r\nwhat the vegetation loses in upward growth it gains in superficial\r\nextension, and thereby it secures more protection against the\r\never-alternating temperature.\r\n\r\nThe further we descend the eastern declivity, the more difficult becomes\r\nthe way. During the rainy season deep fissures are worked out by the\r\nflow of waters; the ground is slippery and full of holes. The sides of\r\nthese hollow passes are often so close together that the rider cannot\r\nkeep his legs down on each side of his mule, and is obliged to raise up\r\nhis feet and thrust them forward. When beasts of burthen, coming in\r\nopposite directions, meet in these places, the direst confusion ensues,\r\nand frequently sanguinary conflicts arise among the Indians. The weaker\r\nparty are then obliged to unload their mules, and the poor beasts are\r\ndragged backward by their hind legs, until they reach a point at which\r\nthere is sufficient space for the others to pass. When I was proceeding\r\nthrough one of these cavities on Christmas-eve, 1840, I encountered a\r\nheavily laden ass coming down a steep declivity. Ere I had time to leap\r\nfrom my saddle, the ass came direct upon me with such force that my\r\nhorse was driven backwards by the concussion, and I was thrown. Ten\r\nmonths afterwards, another encounter of the same kind threatened me with\r\na similar disaster, and to save myself I had no alternative but to shoot\r\nthe ass. The Indian who was driving the animal neglected the usual\r\nwarning cry, given by the arrieros when they enter those dangerous\r\npasses, and he was regardless of my repeated calls desiring him to stop.\r\n\r\nIn some steep places, with the view of improving the roads, the Indians\r\nlay down large stones in the form of steps; but to ride over these rude\r\nflights of steps is no easy task, for the stones are small, and are\r\nplaced at the distance of a foot and a half or two feet apart. The mule\r\nbegins by placing his hind feet on the first stone, then springing\r\nforward he reaches the third stone with his fore feet, at the same time\r\nplacing his hind feet to the second. By this manoeuvre the mule's body\r\nis kept at full stretch, and the rider is obliged to lean forward over\r\nthe animal's neck to avoid being thrown head-foremost by the violent\r\njerks when the mule springs from step to step. It is absolute torture\r\nto ride down a descent of five or six leagues, along a road such as I\r\nhave just described: willingly would the harassed rider dismount and\r\npursue his course on foot; but were he to attempt to do so, the mule\r\nwould stand stock still. I have already remarked the singular\r\nobstinacy with which the mules refuse to proceed when their riders\r\ndismount, and it sometimes gives rise to very comical scenes. On my\r\nway to Vitoc, I was passing through a ravine in which the uprooted\r\ntrunk of a tree was resting slantwise against a rock. Though there was\r\nnot room for me to ride under it, yet there was sufficient space to\r\nallow my mule to pass, and I accordingly dismounted; but all my\r\nefforts to drive the animal forward were fruitless. I had no\r\nalternative but to ride close up to the tree, then spurring the mule,\r\nI quickly slipped out of the saddle, and seizing the trunk of the\r\ntree, I hung to it until the mule had passed on.\r\n\r\nNo less difficult and dangerous are the steep declivities over loamy\r\nsoils, which are frequently met with in these districts. On them the\r\nmule has no firm footing, and is in danger of slipping down at every\r\nstep. But the wonderful instinct of these animals enables them to\r\novercome the difficulty. They approximate the hind and fore feet in\r\nthe manner of the Chamois goat, when he is about to make a spring, and\r\nlowering the hinder part of the body in a position, half sitting half\r\nstanding, they slide down the smooth declivity. At first this sliding\r\nmovement creates a very unpleasant feeling of apprehension, which is\r\nnot altogether removed by frequent repetitions. Accidents frequently\r\noccur, in which both mule and rider are mortally injured.\r\n\r\nThere is more variety of animals in these regions than in the\r\nmountainous parts; but they have few peculiarities of character. The\r\nswift-footed roe of the Cordillera roams here and dwells in the\r\nthickets, avoiding the warm forest. The dark brown coati (_Nasua\r\nmontana_, Tsch.) howls, and digs at the roots of trees in search of\r\nfood; the shy opossum crawls fearfully under the foliage; the lazy\r\narmadillo creeps into his hole; but the ounce and the lion seldom\r\nstray hither to contest with the black bear (_Ursus frugilegus_,\r\nTsch.) the possession of his territory. The little hairy tapir\r\n(_Tapirus villosus_, Wagn.) ventures only at twilight out of his close\r\nambush to forage in the long grass.\r\n\r\nOf the birds there is not much variety of species; but all are\r\nremarkable for gay-colored plumage. Among the most characteristic of\r\nthese districts are the red-bellied tanagra (_Tanagra igniventris_,\r\nOrb.), the fire-colored pyranga (_Phoenisoma bivittata_, Tsch.), two\r\nspecies of the crow, one of which is of a fine blue color (_Cyanocorax\r\nviridicyanus_, G. R. Gray), the other green on the back and bright\r\nyellow on the belly (_Cyanoc. peruanus_, Cab.). The Indians call the\r\nlatter _Quienquien_, as it utters a sort of screaming sound resembling\r\nthese syllables. Individual birds belonging to the Penelope family (_P.\r\nrufiventris_ and _adspersa_, Tsch.) and the green pepper-eater\r\n(_Pteroglossus cæruleo-cinctus_, Tsch., _Pt. atrogularis_, Sturm.) are\r\nfound in the lower forests.\r\n\r\nProceeding still further downward we at length reach the _Montaña_. The\r\nPeruvians apply this name to the vast aboriginal forests which extend\r\nacross the whole country from north to south along the eastern foot of\r\nthe Andes. Those which lie higher, and in which the spaces between the\r\nlofty trees are overgrown with thick masses of bushes and twining\r\nplants, are called by the natives simply _Montañas_. Those which are\r\nfree from these intermediate masses of vegetation they call _Montañas\r\nreales_ (royal mountains). At first sight they produce the impression of\r\na virgin forest of oaks.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the Ceja to the district properly called the Montaña\r\nis very various at different points. In some parts it takes six or\r\neight days' hard riding; in other directions the traveller may, in the\r\nmorning, leave the snow-covered Puna huts, and at sunset, on the\r\nuninhabited margin of the primeval forest, he may taste pine-apples\r\nand bananas of his own gathering. Such a day certainly deserves to\r\nform an epoch in his life; for in the course of a few hours he passes\r\nthrough the most opposite climates of the earth, and the gradual\r\nprogression of the development of the vegetable world is spread out in\r\nvisible reality before him.\r\n\r\nThe Montañas of Peru are, in general, but thinly peopled with Christian\r\nIndians. They are employed either in cultivating their own fields, or in\r\nworking as day-laborers in the great plantations. The productions of the\r\nhaciendas consist chiefly of sugar, coffee, maize, coca, tobacco,\r\noranges, bananas, and pine-apples, which are sent to the Sierra. The\r\ncultivation of bark, balsams, gums, honey and wax, also occupies a\r\ngreat number of Indians.\r\n\r\nThe plantation buildings stand on rising grounds. The walls are\r\nconstructed of reeds, the interstices being filled up with loam, and the\r\nroofs are of straw or palm leaves. Around the buildings are the fields\r\nallotted to cultivation, in which the soils favorable to the production\r\nof certain plants are selected. The coffee usually grows round the\r\nhouse, and an adjacent building contains the store-rooms. The\r\nfruit-trees grow along the margins of the maize fields; marshy ground\r\nis selected for the sugar fields; in the vicinity of brooks and\r\nstreams the useful banana flourishes; the pine-trees are ranged in\r\nrows on the hot, dry declivities, and the coca is found to thrive best\r\nin warm, hollow dells.\r\n\r\nAs the humidity of the atmosphere, added to the multitudes of insects,\r\nmice and rats, prevents any lengthened preservation of provisions, the\r\ncultivators sell or exchange them as speedily as possible; hence arises\r\na very active intercourse in business between the Montañas and the\r\nSierra. The mountain Indians bring llamas, dried meat, potatoes, bark,\r\nand salt, to exchange for fruit; it is very seldom that any money\r\ncirculates in this traffic. Only the owners of plantations sell their\r\nproductions for ready money, with which they purchase, in the upland\r\ntowns, European goods, particularly printed and plain cottons, coarse\r\nwoollen stuffs, knives, hatchets, fishing-tackle, &c.; with these goods\r\nthey pay their laborers, charging them for every article five or even\r\nsix times its value. As there is throughout these forest regions a great\r\nwant of men, the plantation owners endeavor to get the few Indians who\r\nsettle voluntarily on their property, fixed to it for ever. They sell\r\nthem indispensable necessaries at an extravagant price, on condition of\r\ntheir paying for them by field labor.\r\n\r\nI have seen an Indian give five days' labor, from six o'clock in the\r\nmorning to sunset, for a red pocket-handkerchief, which in Germany would\r\nnot be worth four groschen. The desire to possess showy articles, the\r\nnecessity of obtaining materials for his wretched clothing, or\r\nimplements to enable him, in his few free hours, to cultivate his own\r\nfield, and, above all, his passion for coca and intoxicating drinks, all\r\nprompt the Indian to incur debt upon debt to the plantation owner. The\r\nsugar-cane is seldom used in the forest plantations for making sugar.\r\nThe juice is usually converted into the cakes called _chancacas_, which\r\nhave been already mentioned, or it is made into _guarapo_, a strong\r\nliquor, which the Indians spare no effort to procure. When they begin to\r\nbe intoxicated, they desire more and more of the liquor, which is\r\nreadily given, as it is the interest of the owners to supply it. After\r\nsome days of extreme abstinence they return to their work, and then the\r\nMayordomo shows them how much their debt has increased, and the\r\nastonished Indian finds that he must labor for several months to pay it;\r\nthus these unfortunate beings are fastened in the fetters of slavery.\r\nTheir treatment is, in general, most tyrannical. The Negro slave is\r\nfar more happy than the free Indians in the haciendas of this part of\r\nPeru. At sunrise all the laborers must assemble in the courtyard of\r\nthe plantation, where the Mayordomo prescribes to them their day's\r\nwork, and gives them the necessary implements. They are compelled to\r\nwork in the most oppressive heat, and are only allowed to rest thrice\r\nfor a few minutes, at times fixed, for chewing their coca and for\r\ndinner. For indolence or obstinacy they suffer corporal punishment,\r\nusually by being put into a kind of stocks, called the CEPO, in which\r\nthe culprit stands from twelve to forty-eight hours, with his neck or\r\nlegs fixed between two blocks of wood.\r\n\r\nThe labor of bringing the forest lands into a productive state is one of\r\nthe severest tasks in the Montañas, and it can only be performed in the\r\nhottest season of the year. As the soil is always moist, and the\r\nvegetation full of sap, the trees must be cut down about the end of the\r\nrainy season, and after drying for some months they are burned; but they\r\nare seldom brought into a state of such aridity as to be destroyed by\r\nthe action of the fire. This is a considerable obstruction to the\r\nprogress of raising plants; for the seed must be sown between the felled\r\ntrees, which are perhaps only half-charred, and are still damp. In\r\nconsequence of this, the practice is, in the first year, to plant maize\r\nat the places where the burnt trees are laid; the maize grows in almost\r\nincredible abundance, and the result is a singularly rich harvest, after\r\nwhich, part of the burned wood is removed. The same process is renewed\r\nafter every harvest, until all the burnt trees are cleared off and a\r\nfree field gained for the cultivation of the perennial plants.\r\n\r\nFar more fortunate than the Indians who are neighbors of the\r\nplantations, are those who live far back in the interior of the\r\nforests, and who, in consequence of their great distance from any\r\nsettlement, seldom have intercourse with the civilized world. Content\r\nwith what bounteous nature offers them, and ignorant of the wants of\r\nmore refined life, they seek nothing beyond such things as they can,\r\nwithout any great efforts, obtain in the districts in which they\r\ndwell. There they plant their little patches of ground, the care of\r\nwhich is consigned to the women. The men takes their bows and arrows\r\nand set out on hunting expeditions, during which they are for weeks,\r\noften months, absent from their homes. The rainy season drives them\r\nback to their huts, where they indulge in indolent repose, which is\r\nonly occasionally suspended when they are engaged in fishing. The\r\nreturn of the sunny sky draws them out again on their expeditions, in\r\nwhich they collect a sufficient supply of food for the year.\r\n\r\nBut wherever these Indians have settled on the banks of great rivers,\r\nthe trading intercourse produces an alteration in their mode of life.\r\nEuropeans and Creoles then try to create among them, as among the\r\nplantation Indians, a desire to satisfy unnecessary wants, and thereby\r\nthey are induced to collect the valuable productions of the forests.\r\nIn the loftier districts of the Montañas the Peruvian bark is found:\r\nthe lower and more marshy places produce the sarsaparilla, and a sort\r\nof wood for dyeing called _Llangua_. This last-named article has not\r\nyet found its way to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May the Indians assemble to collect the Peruvian bark,\r\nfor which purpose they repair to the extensive Cinchona woods. One of\r\nthe party climbs a high tree to obtain, if possible, an uninterrupted\r\nview over the forest, and to spy out the _Manchas_, or spots where there\r\nare groups of Peruvian bark trees. The men who thus spy out the trees\r\nare called _Cateadores_, or searchers. It requires great experience to\r\nsingle out, in the dark leaf-covered expanse, the Cinchona groups merely\r\nby the particular tint of the foliage, which often differs but very\r\nlittle from that of the surrounding trees. As soon as the cateador has\r\nmarked out and correctly fixed upon the mancha, he descends to his\r\ncompanions, and leads them with wonderful precision through the almost\r\nimpenetrable forest to the group. A hut is immediately built, which\r\nserves as a resting-place during night, and is also used for drying\r\nand preserving the bark. The tree is felled as near the root as\r\npossible, divided into pieces, each from three to four feet long, and\r\nwith a short curved knife a longitudinal incision is made in the bark.\r\nAfter a few days, if the pieces are found to be getting dry, the bark\r\nalready incised is stripped off in long slips, which are placed in the\r\nhut, or in hot weather laid before it to dry. In many parts,\r\nparticularly in the central and southern districts of Peru, where the\r\nmoisture is not very great, the bark is dried in the forest, and the\r\nslips are packed in large bundles. In other districts, on the\r\ncontrary, the bark is rolled up green, and sent to the neighboring\r\nvillages, where it is dried. Towards the end of September the\r\n_Cascarilleros_[79] return to their homes.\r\n\r\nIn the more early periods of South American history, the bark was a\r\nprincipal article of Peruvian commerce. Since the commencement of the\r\npresent century its value has, however, considerably diminished, chiefly\r\nin consequence of adulterated and inferior kinds, which are supplied\r\nfrom other quarters, perhaps also on account of the more frequent use of\r\nquinine; for in the production of the alkaloids less bark is employed\r\nthan was formerly used in substance. During the war of independence the\r\nbark trade received its death-blow, and for the space of several years\r\nscarcely more than a few hundred-weights of bark were exported from\r\nPeru. The Montañas of Huanuco, which once furnished all the apothecaries\r\nof Europe with the \"divine medicine,\" are beginning again to yield\r\nsupplies. From the roots of the felled trees a vigorous after-growth has\r\ncommenced. In the Montañas of Huamalies a kind of bark is found, the\r\nnature of which is not yet defined by botanists; and from the Montañas\r\nof Urubamba comes the highly esteemed _Cascarilla de Cuzco_, which\r\ncontains an alkaloid, named _Cusconin_.[80] Possibly the medicinal\r\nbark may again become a flourishing branch of trade for Peru, though\r\nit can never again recover the importance which was attached to it a\r\ncentury ago. During my residence in Peru, a plan was in agitation for\r\nestablishing a quinine manufactory at Huanuco. The plan, if well\r\ncarried out, would certainly be attended with success. There is in\r\nBolivia an establishment of this kind conducted by a Frenchman; but\r\nthe quinine produced is very impure. The inhabitants of the Peruvian\r\nforests drink an infusion of the green bark as a remedy against\r\nintermitting fever. I have found it in many cases much more\r\nefficacious than the dried kind, for less than half the usual dose\r\nproduces, in a short time, convalescence, and the patient is secure\r\nagainst returning febrile attacks.\r\n\r\nA class of Indians who live far back in the heart of the woods of\r\nSouthern Peru and Bolivia employ themselves almost exclusively in\r\ngathering balsams and odorous gums from resinous plants, many of which\r\nare burned in the churches as incense. They also collect various\r\nobjects, supposed to be sympathetic remedies, such as the claws of the\r\ntapir, against falling sickness; and the teeth of poisonous snakes\r\nwhich, carefully fixed in leaves, and stuck into the tubes of rushes,\r\nare regarded as powerful specifics against headache and blindness.\r\nVarious salves, plasters, powders, seeds, roots, barks, &c., to each of\r\nwhich is attributed some infallible curative power, are prepared and\r\nbrought to market by the Indians. When the rainy season sets in they\r\nleave the forest and proceed in parties to the mountainous country. On\r\nthese occasions, contrary to the general custom of the Indians, the men,\r\nnot the women, carry the burthens. They are accompanied by the women as\r\nfar as the Sierra; for the loads, which are often very heavy, graze the\r\nbacks of the men who carry them, and the women then act as surgeons. The\r\ninjured part is first carefully washed with copaiba balsam, moistened,\r\nthen covered with leaves fixed on with small strips of leather, overlaid\r\nwith the hide of some forest animal. These operations being performed,\r\nthe loads are again fastened on the backs of the Indians. In their\r\nnative forests these people wear but little clothing. Their dress is\r\nlimited to a sort of loose tunic without sleeves for the women, and for\r\nthe men merely a piece of cloth fastened round the waist. They go\r\nbarefooted; but they paint their feet and legs with the juice of the\r\nHuito (_Genipa oblongifolia_, R. Pav.) in such a manner that they seem\r\nto be wearing half-boots. The juice of the Huito has the effect of\r\nprotecting them against the stings of insects. The coloring adheres so\r\nstrongly to the skin that it cannot be washed off by water; but oil\r\nspeedily removes it. In the Sierra these Indians put on warmer clothing,\r\nand on their feet they wear a kind of boots called _aspargetas_, made of\r\nthe plaited tendrils of plants.\r\n\r\nThe stock of balsams and drugs being disposed of, the Indians, after a\r\nfew months' absence, return to their homes. Some of them, however,\r\nwander to the distance of two or three hundred leagues from their native\r\nforests, traversing the greater part of Peru, and even visiting Lima,\r\ncarrying large flask gourds filled with balsams. These wandering tribes\r\nseek frequent contact with other nations. They are not distrustful and\r\nreserved, but, on the contrary, annoyingly communicative. It is not easy\r\nto discover the cause of this exception, or to ascertain the time when\r\nthe Indians began to travel the country as physicians and apothecaries.\r\nThe earliest writers on the oldest epochs of Peruvian history make no\r\nmention of this race of medical pedlars.\r\n\r\nThe Indians here alluded to all profess Christianity, and must, as\r\n_Indios Christianos_, in strict correctness, be distinguished from the\r\nwild Indians, _Indios Bravos_, who exclusively inhabit the eastern\r\nMontañas of Peru, towards the frontiers of Brazil. These Indios Bravos\r\ncomprehend numerous tribes, each of which has its own customs, religion,\r\nand also, in general, its own language. Only very few of them are known,\r\nfor since the overthrow of the missions there is little communication\r\nwith them. Respecting the Indios Bravos who inhabit the Montañas of\r\nSouthern Peru, I have been unable to collect any accurate information.\r\nThey remain quite unknown, for impenetrable wilds intervene between them\r\nand the civilized world, and seldom has a European foot ventured into\r\ntheir territory. The wild Indians in Central Peru are most set against\r\nthe Christians, particularly those called Iscuchanos, in the Montaña de\r\nHuanta, and those known by the name of Chunchos, in the Montaña de\r\nVitoc. The Iscuchanos sometimes maintain with the inhabitants of Huanta\r\na trade of barter; but this intercourse is occasionally interrupted by\r\nlong intervals of hostility, during which the Iscuchanos, though rather\r\nan inoffensive race, commit various depredations on the Huantanos;\r\ndriving the cattle from the pastures, carrying off the produce of the\r\nsoil, and spreading terror throughout the whole district. Some years\r\nago, when the inhabitants of Huanta had assembled for the procession of\r\nthe Festival of Corpus Christi, a troop of Iscuchanos came upon them\r\nwith wild bulls, turning the infuriated animals against the procession,\r\nwhich was dispersed, and many of the Huantanos were killed or severely\r\nwounded. These Iscuchanos are so favored by the locality of the district\r\nthey inhabit, that even were a military expedition sent to drive them\r\nfarther back into the woods, it would probably be unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe Chunchos are far more dangerous, and are one of the most formidable\r\nraces of the Indios Bravos. They inhabit the most southern part of the\r\nPampa del Sacramento (the terra incognita of Peru), and chiefly the\r\ndistrict through which flow the rivers Chanchamayo and Perene. Those\r\nregions are inhabited by a great number of tribes, most of which are\r\nonly known by name. The frontier neighbors of the Chunchos are the\r\nsanguinary Campas or Antes who destroyed the missions of Jesus Maria in\r\nPangoa, and who still occasionally pay hostile visits to San\r\nBuenaventura de Chavini, the extreme Christian outpost in the Montaña de\r\nAndamarca. The savage race of the Casibos, the enemies of all the\r\nsurrounding populations, inhabit the banks of the river Pachitea. This\r\nrace maintains incessant war with all the surrounding tribes, and\r\nconstantly seeks to destroy them. According to the accounts of the\r\nmissionaries, they, as well as the Antes and Chunchos, are still\r\ncannibals, and undertake warlike expeditions for the purpose of\r\ncapturing prisoners, whom they devour. After the rainy season, when\r\nthe Simirinches, the Amapuahas, or Consbos, hunt in the western\r\nforests, they often fall into the hands of the Casibos, who imitate in\r\nperfection the cries of the forest animals, so that the hunters are\r\ntreacherously misled, and being captured, are carried off as victims.\r\nMany horrible accounts of this barbarous tribe were related by the\r\nmissionaries centuries ago, when romantic stories and exaggerations of\r\nevery kind were the order of the day; but the most recent\r\ncommunications of the missionaries from Ocopa confirm the fact, that\r\nin the year 1842, the Casibos continued to be savage Anthropophagi. It\r\nis worthy of remark that they never eat women, a fact which some may\r\nbe inclined to attribute to respect for the female sex. It is,\r\nhowever, assignable to a different feeling. All the South American\r\nIndians, who still remain under the influence of sorcery and\r\nempiricism, consider women in the light of impure and evil beings, and\r\ncalculated to injure them. Among a few of the less rude nations this\r\naversion is apparent in domestic life, in a certain unconquerable\r\ncontempt of females. With the Anthropophagi the feeling extends,\r\nfortunately, to their flesh, which is held to be poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe languages spoken by the wild Indian tribes are very various. From\r\nthe Marañon to Omaguas, Quichua, the language of the Incas, is spoken.\r\nOn the left bank of the Ucayali the dialect of the Panos prevails. On\r\nthe right bank the Cascas, the Sinabus, and the Diabus, preserve their\r\nown idioms, which are so different that those races are reciprocally\r\nunable to communicate with each other. On Upper Ucayali evidences of\r\ncommon origin are said to be apparent between the Simirinches, Campas,\r\nRunaguas, and Mochobos. But on this subject no accurate conclusions\r\ncan be formed; for the accounts given by the missions in early periods\r\nwere very imperfect, and most of the races are so intractable that it\r\nhas since been impossible to collect correct information. According\r\nto the accounts of travelled missionaries which I had the opportunity\r\nof examining in the convent of Ocopa, it appears that, besides the\r\nQuichua, the idioms spoken by the Panos, Cascas, Simirinches, and the\r\nChunchos, may be set down as dialects of decidedly different origins.\r\n\r\nThe mode of living among all these Indians is very much the same. War\r\nand hunting in summer, and repairing their warlike weapons in winter,\r\nare the occupations of the men. The women cultivate the fields, lay up\r\nthe stores of provisions, fish, spin and cook. Their clothes are of the\r\nmost simple kind. Many of the races wear no clothing, and have their\r\nbodies wholly or partially bedaubed with paint. The men of some races\r\nwear a kind of shirt without sleeves, and the women a petticoat reaching\r\nfrom the waist to the knees. These garments are made of cotton obtained\r\nfrom the uncultivated tree _Bombax_, and their color is white, blue, or\r\nred. The custom of boring the ears, the nose, and the under lip, for the\r\ninsertion of some ornament, is much practised, particularly by the\r\nPanos, Shipeos, and Pirras. They paint their bodies, but not exactly in\r\nthe tattoo manner; they confine themselves to single stripes. The Sensis\r\nwomen draw two stripes from the shoulder, over each breast, down to the\r\npit of the stomach; the Pirras women paint a band in the form of a\r\ngirdle round the waist, and they have three of a darker color round each\r\nthigh. These stripes, when once laid on, can never be removed by\r\nwashing. They are made with the unripe fruit of one of the Rubiacaceæ.\r\nSome tribes paint the face only; others, on the contrary, do not touch\r\nthat part; but bedaub with colors their arms, feet, and breasts.\r\n\r\nIn hunting, bows and arrows are the principal weapons used by the\r\nIndians. In war they use, besides bows and arrows, clubs and a kind of\r\nsword made of wood. The arrows are reeds, five or six feet long, and\r\nof the thickness of a finger. The point is of very hard wood, and is\r\nstrongly barbed by notches and with sharp fish teeth about three\r\ninches long. To the other extremity of the arrow colored feathers are\r\nalways affixed.\r\n\r\nAmong many Indians, particularly in the western and northern districts\r\nof the Pampa del Sacramento, the _Pocuna_ is a weapon much used in\r\nhunting. It is made of a long reed, and measures eight or ten, or even\r\nmore, feet. At one end are fixed two teeth of a javali, or white-lipped\r\npeccary (_Dicotyles labiatus_), on which the reed is rested when taking\r\naim. The arrows, which are only one and a half or two inches long, are\r\nmade of the thick part of a strong cactus stem. In general their small\r\narrows are poisoned, for otherwise the wound would be too inconsiderable\r\nto kill even a little bird. The poison for arrows differs almost with\r\nevery tribe, and very mysterious ceremonies are observed at its\r\npreparation. On this account the art of preparing it, and the\r\ningredients employed, are only very partially known to Europeans. Their\r\nelements are obtained from several plants not yet defined botanically,\r\namong which the _Apihuasca_ and poison capsicum are much resorted to.\r\nInfusions of the leaves of a very strong kind of tobacco, and of the\r\nSanaño (_Tabernæmontana Sanaño_, R. P.), and of Euphorbiaceæ, are also\r\ntaken. Some modern travellers, contrary to the testimony of the oldest\r\nwriters on Peru, have asserted that no animal substance is employed in\r\nthe poison for arrows. I am, however, enabled to state, on the authority\r\nof an Indian who had himself often made the poison, that not only the\r\nblack and very poisonous emmet (_Cryptacereo atrato affin_), but also\r\nthe teeth of the formidable serpent, known to the Indians by the name of\r\nMiuamaru or Jergon (_Lachesis picta_, Tsch.), are used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe wound of the poisoned arrow is fatal and rapid. Men and large\r\nmammalia die in about four or five minutes after receiving the wound;\r\nthe smaller mammiferous animals and birds, in two minutes. The blow-reed\r\nsends these deadly arrows with great certainty to the distance of\r\nthirty-two or thirty-six paces. Hunting with the blow-reed must be long\r\npractised in order to acquire dexterity in its use, and great caution is\r\nrequisite to avoid being self-wounded by the small sharp arrows. An\r\nexample came to my knowledge in the case of an Indian who let an arrow\r\nfall unobserved from his quiver; he trod upon it, and it penetrated the\r\nsole of his foot; in a very short time he was a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe club called _Matusino_ is four or five feet long, and is encircled\r\nin a spiral form at the thick end, by a row of deer's horns. A single\r\nlong horn is fastened in the centre, the chief use of which is to\r\nstick it in the earth when the club is rested. Only a few races of\r\nupper and lower Ucayali and the Sensis use this formidable weapon,\r\nwhich is very inconvenient and obstructive in passing through thick\r\nforests. The _macana_, or wooden sword, is made of strong _chunta_.\r\nThe color of this wood is a deep blackish brown; it is very hard and\r\nheavy, and is always used for implements which require great\r\ndurability and strength. The macana is about four feet long, one inch\r\nthick, and from five to six inches broad; towards the hilt end the\r\nbreadth is about three inches, and it is rounded. It is so well cut\r\nand polished, that a sabre scarcely excels it in sharpness. The weapon\r\nis so heavy that it requires both hands to wield it.\r\n\r\nThere are not only offensive, but also defensive, weapons. One of the\r\nlatter is the _viche_, a very simple shield, one and a half or two feet\r\nin diameter. It consists of a strong frame of twisted creeping plants,\r\nover which the skin of a deer or tapir is stretched and fastened with\r\ntwine. On the inside there are two holds for the arm; the edge is\r\nadorned with colored feathers.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the races above noticed seldom live in villages, but\r\nchiefly in huts scattered through the forests. Sometimes they construct\r\na few of their dwellings near together, and so form a hamlet. Their huts\r\nare either quadrangular, oblong, or circular. The walls consist of\r\nstrong stems of trees, bound together by twining plants; and the roof is\r\nof palm leaves laid over a skeleton of reeds. The entrance, which is on\r\nthe side opposite to the prevailing wind, is left open, and but seldom\r\nprotected by a door. At Chanchamayo I saw a very simple kind of hut\r\namong the Chunchos. It resembled an open umbrella with the handle stuck\r\nin the earth. The single wall, which also formed its roof, consisted of\r\neight long reeds: they spread out below in the form of a fan, standing\r\nobliquely on the earth, and fastened to three stems of trees. On this\r\nsimple skeleton were laid lengthways the leaves of the omero, a kind of\r\npalm. A strong stem fixed firmly in the earth, extended obliquely to the\r\nmiddle of the inner side of the wall, and two thinner stems on each\r\nside, served as supports for this frail building. According to the\r\ndirection of the wind the hut is turned round.\r\n\r\nThe Indian huts all stand detached from each other, and they are seldom\r\ndivided internally into apartments. They occupy very little ground,\r\nnever more than sixty square feet of superficies. In the principal\r\nsettlement of an Indian race, the huts are scattered over a circuit of\r\nsome miles in the forests.\r\n\r\nAny form of government is a thing quite unknown to most of the Indios\r\nBravos of Peru. Uniformity of speech, manners, and arms, unite together\r\na number of Indians, who thus form a race, but there is among them no\r\nbond of subjection, or of duty to any government, either voluntarily\r\nchosen, or self-constituted. Among the inhabitants of Lower Ucayali,\r\nhowever, the oldest, or the bravest individuals of each race are either\r\npublicly, or silently recognised as chiefs. Respect to age prevails only\r\namong a few of the races, as the Setebos, Mayorhunas, and Panos. Among\r\nothers, as the Campos, Casibos, and Cunchos, the old are put to death.\r\nIt is a general custom of the wild Indians to kill their aged prisoners\r\nimmediately on their being captured.\r\n\r\nSocial meetings among these races are of rare occurrence. Gloomy,\r\nreserved, and distrustful, the Indian is only at ease in the circle he\r\nhas himself formed. When, however, the general interest of the race is\r\nin question, then he comes boldly forward in support of the whole. The\r\nusual assemblages are for the arrangement of long hunting excursions,\r\nand warlike expeditions. The departures and the returns are celebrated\r\nby tumultuous feasts, in which intoxicating drinks flow freely. Most of\r\nthe liquors are prepared from Yucca, or the fruits of the Chunta, called\r\nthe _Mazato_, or other species of palms. In the most remote forests, and\r\namong the most insulated tribes, the preparation of intoxicating liquors\r\nis known; and there certainly is not in all South America an Indian race\r\nwhich is not familiar with it. Wild dances form part of the\r\nentertainments, and the banquet usually ends with a sanguinary battle.\r\n\r\nMarriage in most races is celebrated socially, but not among those in\r\nwhich polygamy prevails. The formula observed on the occasion differs in\r\ndifferent tribes; in some the union is effected under painful ceremonies\r\nto the bride, in others with fasting and penitential torments to the\r\nbridegroom. In general the Indian selects a wife for himself. In the\r\ngreater number of tribes a maiden is set up as a prize, and the young\r\nmen commence a life or death contest for her. The oldest warriors are\r\narbitrators, and from their hands the conqueror receives the prize. This\r\nis the practice among the inhabitants of the Rio de Santa Catalina. With\r\nthem, as well as with most of the tribes of Western Ucayali, the birth\r\nof a child is festively celebrated. The oldest individuals of the race\r\nassemble to receive the child, which is repeatedly blown on to drive\r\ndemons and sickness away from it; the name of an animal is then given\r\nto it, and, according to Don Pedro Beltran, the witnesses of the\r\nceremony mark with a wooden pencil some hieroglyphic characters on two\r\nleaves, which are carefully preserved, and on the death of the Indian,\r\ndeposited in the grave with him.\r\n\r\nThe dead are buried in the huts. The survivors having testified their\r\nsorrow by a melancholy howl three times repeated, leave the place and\r\nbuild a new residence for themselves in a distant district. They break\r\nin pieces all the household furniture of the deceased, but they bury\r\nwith him his warlike weapons and his agricultural implements, under the\r\nconviction that he will use them in the place to which he is going. A\r\npeculiar custom among several races is this: the oldest son cuts a\r\npiece from the heel of his deceased father, which he hangs round his\r\nneck, and wears as a sacred relic. Some of the tribes on the Perene\r\nand Capanegua do not, like most wild nations, respect the remains of\r\nthe dead, but throw the bodies into the forest unburied, to be\r\ndevoured by beasts of prey.\r\n\r\nVery little is correctly known of the religion of the Peruvian Indios\r\nBravos. All believe in the existence of superior beings, and distinguish\r\nthem as good and evil; and they are accordingly venerated from\r\ngratitude, or from fear. The former they regard as beneficent; but the\r\nlatter as having the power of bringing into exercise all the destroying\r\nforces of nature. These people, therefore, find in the sky, in the air,\r\nand on the earth, objects for their adoration. Certain constellations\r\nare regarded as favorable phenomena, while others are looked at with a\r\nsecret horror. The sun is by all gladly worshipped, more particularly by\r\nthe descendants of those who in early times stood in connexion with the\r\nIncas. On the other hand, they pay but a reluctant tribute to the moon,\r\nperhaps because by its pale light fearful images are reflected around\r\nthem in the forests, and because its phases are to them involved in\r\nimpenetrable mystery. They ascribe thunder and lightning to demoniacal\r\ninfluences, and to the same origin they attribute certain winds which\r\nhave an injurious influence on their health. But their religious notions\r\nare not connected exclusively with the phenomena of nature, which are to\r\nthem inexplicable. With all their ideas on surrounding nature, two\r\nconflicting principles are invariably connected, one of which is\r\nbelieved to be beneficial, the other injurious to them. In the animals\r\nof the forest, the plants, the stones, in everything, they trace these\r\nbeneficent or demoniacal powers. Every idea, every action is with them a\r\nconsequence of the influence of one of these two powers, and free will\r\nis impossible. Though a rude materialism cripples the intelligence of\r\nthese Indians, yet they seem to be sensible of the connexion between\r\nthat which is perceptible to their senses, and something\r\nhigher--something beyond the sphere of corporeal perception. But of the\r\nnature of this higher something they have no comprehension, nor do they\r\nendeavor to render to themselves any account of it. They are satisfied\r\nwith an obscure idea of the difference between the visible and the\r\ninvisible; but still this idea is so contracted that they always give to\r\nthe spiritual a corporeal form: and they attribute to natural objects\r\nwith which they come most in contact, the possession of good or evil\r\nqualities, thus assigning to them the nature of spiritual beings.\r\n\r\nNone of these tribes appear, as yet, to have advanced so far as to be\r\nimpressed with the persuasion that the whole of nature is guided by\r\nunchangeable laws over which one will presides. In general, they have\r\nno idea of a spiritual unity, and are utter strangers to the knowledge\r\nof one God. They all, however, believe in the immortality of the soul.\r\nThey see the lifeless body, they have certain proof that the earthly\r\nintegument is no longer the abode of the soul; but, as they can form\r\nno notion of anything spiritual entirely self-existent, they imagine\r\nthat their dead will, in new life, appear under a new bodily form. The\r\nseveral tribes differ greatly in their belief of the nature of the\r\nmetamorphoses which they expect to take place. Those who look forward\r\nto the re-appearance of the deceased in human life, bury with the men\r\nhunting and agricultural instruments; but their notions even on this\r\nhead are not very clear, and when questioned on the subject their\r\nanswers are very confused. They say that they are going to a very\r\nbeautiful place, far from their present dwelling; but, according to\r\ntheir conception, it appears that the place, though distant, is still\r\non earth. Those races who believe in metamorphoses into the forms of\r\nthe lower animals, are persuaded that the dead in their new forms will\r\ninhabit the woods around their homes, and avenge the wrongs they have\r\nsuffered during life. This is the belief of the inhabitants of Upper\r\nUcayali and Pachitea.\r\n\r\nIn considering the physical formation of the wild Indians, we may class\r\nthem according to their natural divisions, viz., the inhabitants of the\r\nmore highly situated lands, or mountains, and those of the low hot flat\r\ncountry. The former dwell on the eastern side of the hill-chain,\r\ndividing the river territory of the Huallaga and Ucayali, and spreading\r\nto the banks of the Chauchamayo, Perene, and Apurimac. These are the\r\nIscuchanos. They are rather tall and generally slim; their limbs are\r\nvigorous; their hands and feet small, and in walking their toes are much\r\nturned in. The head is proportionally large, with very strong bones; the\r\nforehead is low, the eyes small and animated, the nose large and rather\r\nsharp, the cheek-bones a little prominent. The mouth is not large, and\r\nthe lips are delicately formed, but often disfigured by ornaments. The\r\nears are small, quite the reverse of those of the Indians of the flat\r\nlands. The pointed chin is only sparingly covered with beard, which does\r\nnot appear until advanced age, and on the cheeks there is none. The hair\r\nof the head is long, stiff, and of a brilliant black. Many of the tribes\r\ndye their hair; the Chunchos dye it red, and the Antis are said to dye\r\nit blue; as to the latter color it appears to me improbable, but I\r\nmention it on the authority of Friar Leceta. The skin is fine and soft,\r\nthe color a deep rusty brown. In speaking of the South American Indians,\r\nit is usual to describe their skin as copper color, but this term is\r\nincorrect, for there certainly is no single tribe to which it might be\r\nperfectly applicable. It appears to me that the color of all is much\r\nfainter, and tending more to brown or yellow. \"Rusty brown,\" if the\r\nexpression may be used, appears to me far more descriptive.\r\n\r\nThe second natural section of the wild Indians inhabits the northern\r\npart of the Pampa del Sacramento, the banks of the Ucayali, and of the\r\nMarañon. They are smaller than those just described. There is a\r\ncertain peculiarity in the make of these people; for though they are\r\nbroad over the shoulders yet their chests are flat, and their shoulder\r\nblades lie low. Their limbs are lank, and their hands rather small;\r\nthe soles of the feet are broad and flat. The face is broad, the eyes\r\nlong shaped, the pupil deeply set, the nose is flat, with large\r\noblique nostrils, and the cheek-bones are prominent. The mouth is\r\nwide, the lips thick, and among some tribes the mouth and nose are\r\nvery close together. The chin is small and round, the ears large and\r\nstanding out from the head. The hair and beard of these Indians are\r\nthe same as in those of the hilly country. The color of the skin\r\nvaries much; in some it is a light reddish brown; in others, a kind of\r\nyellow, very like that of the Mongols. The women of all these tribes\r\nare exceedingly ugly, and far from corresponding with the picture a\r\nEuropean imagination might form of the daughters of the aboriginal\r\nforests. These women soon become old, for they not only fulfil female\r\nduties, but execute the greater part of those severer labors which\r\nought to fall to the share of the stronger sex.\r\n\r\nTo the above outline sketch of the human inhabitants of the aboriginal\r\nforests, I will now add some description of the animal world, as it came\r\nunder my observation in those luxuriant regions.\r\n\r\nUnlike the peaceful repose which presides over animal life on the level\r\nheights, are the constant aggressions and combats which prevail in the\r\nforest regions. There the strong attack the weak, and the cunning\r\ninveigle the unwary: strength and intelligence, caution and instinct,\r\nare unceasingly in active operation. The variegated forms and colors\r\nwhich meet the eye, and the multifarious cries and tones which resound\r\nthrough the woods, form, altogether, the most singular contrast. The\r\ngold-feathered colibri hums lightly through the air, soaring over the\r\nheavy, sombre-colored tapir. The sprightly singing-bird pours forth his\r\nmelodious chants amidst the thick foliage of the aged trees, whilst the\r\nfierce ounce, prowling for his prey, growls as he passes over their\r\nenormous, spreading roots. Slowly do the eye and the ear learn to\r\ndistinguish individuals in the vast mass of apparent chaotic confusion,\r\nand to recognise quickly fleeting forms, or distant resounding sounds.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the animal world is here developed to the view, and it\r\nwould be difficult to assign the predominance to any one class. Yet,\r\nperhaps, the variegated feathered tribe is relatively most extensively\r\nrepresented. The number of the mammalia is also important. They are\r\nseldom seen by the hunter during the day, but twilight draws them from\r\ntheir hiding-places.\r\n\r\nTroops of monkeys skip from tree to tree, looking timidly around, and\r\nuttering mournful howls. Among them are swarms of the black marimonda\r\n(_Ateles_), with slender long arms and red-brown or black faces; in some\r\nthe faces are encircled with white hair (_Ateles marginatus_, Geoff.),\r\nwhich gives them a striking resemblance to an old negro. Next is seen a\r\ngroup of silver-grey monkeys (_Lagothrix Humboldtii_, Geoff.), stalking\r\nover heaps of broken branches and twigs in search of a resting-place.\r\nThese monkeys, which are the largest in South America, are about three\r\nfeet high, and are bold and vicious. When wounded they take a position\r\nof defence against the hunter, struggling, and uttering loud cries, upon\r\nwhich their companions hasten down from the trees to assist them. But\r\nsoon a short stifled cry is heard: it is the cry of mortal convulsion.\r\nThat sound drives them instantly back, and they disperse in wild flight.\r\nThe sly sayu ventures to approach the dwellings of men, where he\r\nplunders maize fields with incredible dexterity. The delicate\r\nsilky-haired monkey, shivering at every cool breeze or shower of rain,\r\nand starting at the slightest noise, creeps for shelter into the\r\nthicket, where he lies peeping with his penetrating eyes in the\r\ndirection of the apprehended danger.\r\n\r\nAt sunset swarms of bats flutter through field and forest in all\r\ndirections, and greedily devour the insects which in the twilight awaken\r\nto full activity. Some of these bats (_Phyllostoma hastatum_, Geoff.)\r\nare remarkable for their expanse of wing, which measures nearly two\r\nfeet. Others are distinguished for ugliness and for their offensive\r\nsmell. These latter fly into the Indian huts at night and greatly annoy\r\nthe inhabitants, who cannot get rid of them by fire or smoke, or any\r\nother means, until at the midnight hour they retire of their own accord.\r\nNot less troublesome are the leaf-nosed bats (_Phyllostoma_), which\r\nattack both man and beast. This bat rubs up the skin of his victim, from\r\nwhich he sucks the blood. The domestic animals suffer greatly from the\r\nnocturnal attacks of these bats, and many are destroyed by the\r\nexhaustion consequent on the repeated blood-sucking. The blood drawn by\r\nthe bat itself does not exceed a few ounces; but if, when satisfied, it\r\ndrops down to the ground, or flies away, the wound continues to bleed\r\nfor a long time, and in the morning the animal is often found in a very\r\nweak condition, and covered with blood. One of my mules, on which a\r\nleaf-nosed bat made a nightly attack, was only saved by having his back\r\nrubbed with an ointment made of spirits of camphor, soap and petroleum.\r\nThe blood-suckers have such an aversion to the smell of this ointment\r\nthat on its application they ceased to approach the mule. These bats are\r\nvery mischievous in the plantations of the forests, where beasts of\r\nburden and horned cattle are exposed to their attacks. Whether they\r\nventure to assail man has been a much disputed question. Several\r\ntravellers declare that they do not. I may, however, mention a case\r\nwhich occurred within my own knowledge. A bat (_Ph. erythromos_, Tsch.)\r\nfastened on the nose of an Indian lying intoxicated in a plantation, and\r\nsucked so much blood that it was unable to fly away. The slight wound\r\nwas followed by such severe inflammation and swelling that the features\r\nof the Cholo were not recognisable.\r\n\r\nMany beasts of prey, and among them some of formidable strength and\r\nfierceness, make havoc among the other animals of the forests. In the\r\nlofty Montañas the black bear (_U. frugilegus_, Tsch.) roams as wild as\r\nhis fellow-depredator of the Cordillera. He often enters the maize\r\nfields of the Indians, breaks the stalks of the plants and drags the\r\ngreen tops away to his hole. When this bear cannot obtain his customary\r\nvegetable food, consisting chiefly of the fruits of a pandanea\r\n(_Phytelephas_), he watches for the deer and wild boars, or attacks the\r\noxen employed to turn the machinery in the sugar-mills: he has even\r\nbeen known to assail solitary travellers. The lively coatis traverse the\r\nforests in flocks. They collect round the roots of trees and search for\r\nthe larvæ of insects; light-footed, they climb up bush and tree to find\r\nbirds' nests, and feast on the eggs and the young. With a monotonous\r\nhowl, not unlike that made by some dogs on a clear moonlight night, the\r\nyellow-breasted glutton (_Galictis barbara_, Wieg.), the omeyro of the\r\nIndians, announces his presence. But the most fierce of all these wild\r\nforest animals are those of the feline class. The spotless dark-grey\r\nyaguarundi, not much larger than the wild cat of Europe, pursues all\r\nkinds of birds, particularly the pigeon, the partridge, and the\r\npenelope. The oscollo (_F. celidogaster_, Tem.), the uturunca (_F.\r\npardalis_, L.), and the long-tailed, yellowish-grey tiger-cat (_F.\r\nmacrourura_, Pr. M.), all lie in wait, not only for the weaker mammalia,\r\nbut sometimes they even venture into the plantations and kill dogs and\r\npoultry. The maneless Mexican Lion (the puma) roams through the upper\r\nregions of the forest, where he has almost undisputed hunting-ground. He\r\nfearlessly assails victims who cannot effectually defend themselves,\r\nsuch as the horse, the mule, and the ass, and he tears large pieces of\r\nflesh from their ribs; but he does not venture to meddle with oxen. He\r\nshuns men, and in the forest he even flies from the unarmed Indian. I\r\nfired at a very large puma, which immediately fled, roaring loudly.\r\nWhen severely wounded and driven into a corner, this animal frequently\r\ncommences a combat of despair, and sometimes kills the hunter. The\r\npuma measures in length about four feet, and in height more than two\r\nfeet. More direful than any of the felines mentioned above is the\r\nsanguinary ounce,[81] which possesses vast strength, and is of a most\r\nsavage disposition. Though the favorite haunts of this animal are the\r\nexpansive Pajonales, yet he frequently takes up his abode in the\r\nvicinity of villages and plantations, spreading terror among the\r\ninhabitants. Far from being intimidated at the sight of men, he often\r\nattacks individuals, and when pressed by hunger is not afraid, even\r\nin broad daylight, to slip into the forest villages in order to carry\r\noff food, and the booty, when once seized, is not easily recovered.\r\n\r\nAn amusing example of this occurred in the Montaña of Vitoc. An Indian\r\none night heard his only pig squeaking loudly, as if in pain. He\r\nhastened to the door of his hut to see what was the matter, and he\r\ndiscovered that an ounce had seized the pig by the head, and was\r\ncarrying it off. The Cholo, who determined to make an effort to recover\r\nhis property, seized the pig by the hind legs, and endeavored to drag it\r\nfrom the grasp of the robber. This contest was kept up for some time,\r\nthe ounce, with his eyes glaring in the darkness, holding fast the head\r\nof the pig, and the Indian pulling it hard by the legs. At length the\r\nIndian's wife came to the door of the hut with a lighted fagot, and the\r\nscared ounce, with terrible howlings, slowly retired to the forest. In\r\ngeneral the Indians have a great dread of these animals, and seldom\r\nventure singly into the parts they frequent. The ounce hunter is the\r\nonly one who ventures to approach them. He is armed with a long spear,\r\nwith which he gives the ferocious animal a death-blow. He lets the ounce\r\ncome within a few paces of him without making the least show either of\r\nflight or attack. If, however, the stroke he aims does not immediately\r\nreach the seat of life, the hunter, in general, becomes the victim of\r\nhis bold attempt. Before he can stand on his defence, the wounded ounce\r\ndrags him to the ground, and tears the flesh from his bones.\r\n\r\nSometimes the villagers collect their dogs together for a general hunt.\r\nThey drive the ounce into a place from whence there is no escape, or\r\noften up a tree, where they shoot him with long arrows sent from their\r\nbows or blow-tubes. In a few places snares are laid, or large holes are\r\ndug, and a sharp-pointed stake is stuck in the middle, covered with\r\nstalks and branches of trees, on which the bait is laid. The ounce is,\r\nhowever, too cunning to be easily caught in traps, and it is only when\r\npressed by hunger that he can be tempted by a bait. In some districts\r\nthe ounces have increased so greatly, and done so much damage, that the\r\nnatives have been compelled to remove and settle in other places. I need\r\nonly refer to the Quebrada of Mayunmarca, in the Montaña of Huanta,\r\nnear the road to Anco. There once stood the little village of Mayumarca,\r\nwhich has been abandoned for more than a hundred years, as it was found\r\nthat the jaguars annually decimated the inhabitants; this Quebrada is\r\nstill in such bad repute that not a single Indian will venture into it.\r\n\r\nThere is a black variety of the ounce, by many erroneously regarded as a\r\ndistinct species. It has the identical marks of the common jaguar, or\r\nounce, only its color is a dark, blackish-brown, whereby the whole of\r\nthe black spots are rendered indistinct. On the lower banks of the\r\nUcayali and the Marañon this dark variety is more frequently met with\r\nthan in the higher forests; in the Montañas of Huanta and Urubamba it is\r\nalso not uncommon. It is upon the whole larger, stronger, and more\r\ndaring than the lighter kind, and I have actually seen many black\r\nskins which exceeded the usual length; but of specific distinctions\r\nthere is no indication. The superstitious Indians assign extraordinary\r\npowers to everything that departs from the common course; the black\r\nounce is, accordingly, supposed to possess singular properties. The\r\nyana chinca holds a prominent place in the religious ceremonies of\r\nsome of the Indian races.\r\n\r\nTurning from these fierce natives of the forest, we will now take a\r\nglimpse at the peaceful inhabitants of those umbrageous regions. In\r\nthe hollow stems of trees, or among their canopied branches, are found\r\nthe timid marsupial animals (_Did. impavida_, and _noctivaga_, Tsch.).\r\nThese animals remain in obscure holes until the sun sinks beneath the\r\nhorizon, when they slip out in search of insects and fruit. Not\r\nunfrequently they penetrate into the slightly guarded Indian huts,\r\ncreeping into every corner, until at last they are caught in traps\r\nbaited with pieces of banana and pine-apple. The lofty\r\n_Terebinthaceæ_, with their walnut-like fruit, are inhabited by\r\nswarms of squirrels, which strongly remind the European of his own\r\nwoods. Numbers of the mouse family, from the small tree-mouse\r\n(_Drymomys parvulus_, Tsch.) to the large, loathsome, spinous rat\r\n(_Echinomys leptosoma_, Wagn.) swarm over all the Montañas, and love\r\nto approximate to the dwellings of man. These animals destroy the\r\ngathered harvest, and even in these remote regions they become a\r\nplague. It is a striking fact, that certain animals are almost\r\ninseparable from man. They keep with him, or follow him wherever he\r\nsettles. The mouse genus is one of these. On the coast, mice are not\r\nthe same as on the mountains, and in the forests they are again\r\ndifferent. Everywhere they leave their original dwelling-places, which\r\nthey exchange for an abode with man. As the mouse and the rat attack\r\nthe gathered fruits of the earth, the agouti preys on those yet\r\nstanding in the field. These animals are seldom found in the depths of\r\nthe forest, but more frequently on its edge near the chacras of the\r\nIndians. Shortly before sunset they leave the thickets, and stealthily\r\nrepair to the maize, yucca, and anana fields, where they scratch up the\r\nroot and eat the grain and fruit; but the slightest noise drives them\r\nback to their holes. In the deeper recesses of the forest resounds the\r\nmonotonous, drawling cry of the sloth. Here we have a symbol of life\r\nunder the utmost degree of listlessness, and of the greatest\r\ninsensibility in a state of languid repose. This emblem of misery fixes\r\nitself on an almost leafless bough, and there remains defenceless; a\r\nready prey to any assailant. Better defended is the scale-covered\r\narmadillo, with his coat of mail. Towards evening he burrows deep holes\r\nin the earth, and searches for the larvæ of insects, or he ventures out\r\nof the forest, and visits the yucca fields, where he digs up the\r\nwell-flavored roots. The ant-eater rakes up with his long curved claws\r\nthe crowded resorts of ants, stretches out his long, spiral, and\r\nadhesive tongue, into the midst of the moving swarm, and draws it back\r\ncovered with a multitude of crawling insects.\r\n\r\nIn the soft marshy grounds, or in the damp shady recesses of the\r\nforests, the heavy tapir reposes during the heat of the day; but when\r\nthe fresh coolness of evening sets in, he roves through the forest,\r\ntears the tender twigs from the bushes, or seeks food in the\r\ngrass-covered Pajonales. Sometimes a multitude of tapirs sally from the\r\nforests into the cultivated fields, to the great alarm of the Indians. A\r\nbroad furrow marks the tract along which they have passed, and the\r\nplants they encounter in their progress are trampled down or devoured.\r\nSuch a visit is particularly fatal to the coca fields; for the tapirs\r\nare extremely fond of the leaves of the low-growing coca plant, and they\r\noften, in one night, destroy a coca field which has cost a poor Indian\r\nthe hard labor of a year.\r\n\r\nFlocks of the umbilical hog, or peccary, traverse the level Montañas. If\r\none of them is attacked by the hunter, a whole troop falls furiously on\r\nhim, and it is only by promptly climbing up a tree that he can escape;\r\nthen, whizzing and grunting, they surround the stem, and with their\r\nsnouts turn up the earth round the root, as if intending to pull down\r\nthe tree and so get at their enemy. The stag lurks in the thicket to\r\nwithdraw from the eyes of the greedy ounce; but towards evening he\r\nleaves his hiding place, and sometimes strays beyond the boundary of the\r\nforest; he ventures into the maize fields of the plantations, where he\r\ntarries until night is far advanced.\r\n\r\nThe same diversity of nature and habits is seen in the numerous hosts of\r\nbirds that inhabit the leafy canopies of the forest. On the loftiest\r\ntrees, or on detached rocks, eagles, kites, and falcons, build their\r\neyries. The most formidable of these birds of prey, both for boldness\r\nand strength, the _Morphnus harpyia_, Cab., darts down on the largest\r\nanimals, and fears not to encounter the fiercest inhabitants of the\r\nforest. The owl (_Noctua_, _Scops_, _Strix_), and the goat-milker\r\n(_Caprimulgus_, _Hydropsalis_, _Chordiles_), fly with softly flapping\r\nwings to their hunting quarters to surprise their victims while asleep.\r\nIn the hilly parts of the Montañas the black ox-bird (_Cephalopterus\r\nornatus_, Geoff.), the _Toropishu_ of the Indians, fills the forest with\r\nhis distant bellow, similar to the roaring of a bull. The _Tunqui_[82]\r\ninhabits the same district. This bird is of the size of a cock; the body\r\nis bright red, but the wings are black. The head is surmounted by a tuft\r\nof red feathers, beneath which the orange bill projects with a slight\r\ncurve. It lives sociably with other birds in thickets, or among Cinchona\r\ntrees, the fruit of which is part of its food. Its harsh cry resembles\r\nthe grunt of the hog, and forms a striking contrast to its beautiful\r\nplumage. Numberless fly-catchers and shrikes (_Muscicapidæ_ and\r\n_Laniadæ_) hover on tree and bush, watching for the passing insects,\r\nwhich they snatch up with extraordinary dexterity. Finches twitter on\r\nthe summits of the loftiest trees beyond the reach of the hunter's shot:\r\nthey are distinguished, like the _Ampelidæ_, who, however, live amongst\r\nthe lower bushes, by the lively and almost dazzling colors of their\r\nfeathers. In modest plumage of cinnamon-brown, with head and neck of\r\ndark olive, the _Organista_[83] raises, in the most woody parts of the\r\nforest, her enchanting song, which is usually the prognostic of an\r\napproaching storm. The tender, melancholy strains and the singular\r\nclearness of the innumerable modulations charm the ear of the astonished\r\ntraveller, who, as if arrested by an invisible power, stops to listen to\r\nthe syren, unmindful of the danger of the threatening storm. On old\r\ndecayed stumps of trees the busy creeper[84] and the variegated\r\nwoodpecker are seen pecking the insects from under the loose bark, or by\r\ntheir tapping bring them out of their concealed crevices; while the\r\nred-tailed potter-bird (_Opetiorynchus ruficandus_, Pr. Max.) builds his\r\ndwelling of potter's clay, or loam, as firmly as if it were destined to\r\nlast for ever. The pouched starlings[85] hang their nests, often four or\r\nfive feet long, on the slender branches of trees, where they swing to\r\nand fro with the slightest breath of wind. Like a dazzling flash of\r\ncolored light the colibri (humming-bird) appears and disappears. No\r\ncombination of gorgeous coloring can exceed that which is presented in\r\nthe plumage of the golden-tailed humming or fly-bird (_Trochilus\r\nchrysurus_, Cuv.) which haunts the warm primeval forests, but it is\r\nstill more frequently found in the pure atmosphere of the ceja-girded\r\nMontañas. The silky cuckoo (_Trogon heliothrix_, Tsch.) retires into the\r\nthickest masses of foliage, from which its soft rose-colored plumage\r\npeeps out like a flower. The cry of the voracious chuquimbis[86]\r\naccompanies the traveller from his first steps in the Montañas to his\r\nentrance into the primeval forests, where he finds their relative, _Dios\r\nte de_.[87] This bird accompanies its significant cry by throwing back\r\nits head and making a kind of rocking movement of its body. The Indians,\r\nwho are always disposed to connect superstitious ideas with the natural\r\nobjects they see around them, believe that some great misfortune will\r\nbefall any one who may shoot this bird, because it utters the sacred\r\nword, _Dios_. Long trains of green parrots fill the air with their noisy\r\nchattering. One kind of these birds (_Ps. mercenarius_, Tsch.) is\r\nremarkable for regular migrations. Every morning they sally forth in\r\nflocks from the upper to the lower forests, where they pass the day, and\r\nthey regularly return before sunset to their roosting-places. From year\r\nto year these parrots leave their night quarters daily at the same hour,\r\nand return with equal punctuality before sunset. This regularity of\r\ndeparting and returning has caused the natives to give them the name of\r\n_Jornaleros_ (day-laborers). From the depth of the forests sounds often\r\narise which resemble human voices, and the astonished hunter then\r\nbelieves that he is in the vicinity of his companions, or, perhaps, of\r\nhostile Indians. He eagerly listens, and it is only when well acquainted\r\nwith the sounds of the winged inhabitants of the woods that he can\r\nrecognise the melancholy tones of the wood-pigeons (_C. infuscata_,\r\nLicht.; _C. melancholica_, Tsch.). When day begins to depart, groups of\r\nthe pheasant-like Hachahuallpa[88] assemble, and with the cry of _Ven\r\nacá_, _Ven acá_,[89] summon their distant companions.\r\n\r\nNot only are the trees of the forests peopled with myriads of birds,\r\nbut the earth has also its feathered inhabitants, who seldom soar\r\nabove the level of the soil. They build their nests among the roots\r\nand fallen branches, and depend for movement more on their feet than\r\non their wings. Among those members of the winged tribe, who show no\r\ndisposition to soar into the regions of air, we find here the\r\nturcassa, a pigeon with richly-shaded plumage; the beautifully\r\nspeckled toothed fowl (_Odontophorus speciosus_, Tsch.), and\r\nshort-tailed grass fowl, or crake,[90] whose flesh when cooked is\r\ndelicately white and finely flavored. In marshy places and on the\r\nslimy banks of rivers, the jabiru (_Mycteria americana_, L.) loves to\r\nwade, together with the rose-colored spoon-bill (_Platalea ajaja_,\r\nL.); the fish-devouring ibis (_Tantalus loculator_, L.), the\r\ncurved-billed snipe (_Rhynchoea Hilærea_, Val.), the party-colored\r\ncranes, plovers, land-rails, shrites, and even sea-swallows.[91] In\r\nthe rivers there are ducks: these birds are, perhaps, carried down by\r\nthe currents from the Andes, or, possibly, they fly in great trains\r\nfrom the inner waters of Brazil.\r\n\r\nOf the amphibia in the principal forests of Peru, only the great\r\nfresh-water tortoise (_Hydraspis expansa_, Fitz.) is useful to the\r\nnatives. On the sandy banks of rivers this animal buries its eggs, from\r\nwhich the Indians extract oil: its flesh, also, supplies well-flavored\r\nfood. All other animals of this class are objects of terror, or at least\r\nof aversion, to the Indians. In the warm sand of the river banks, lies\r\nthe lazy caiman.[92] He keeps his jaws wide open, only closing them to\r\nswallow the innumerable flies which he catches on his tongue. To the\r\nhelplessness of these animals when on land, the natives have to be\r\nthankful that they are not the most dangerous scourges of the forest: in\r\nwater, their boldness and swiftness of motion are fearful. The number of\r\nlizards here is not great, nor do they attain so considerable a size as\r\nin other equatorial regions. The serpents are to be feared, and on\r\napproaching them, it is not easy to decide at the first view whether\r\nthey belong to a poisonous or innoxious species. In the forests, where\r\nthe fallen leaves lie in thick, moist layers, the foot of the hunter\r\nsinks deep at every step. Multitudes of venomous amphibia are hatched\r\nin the half-putrescent vegetable matter, and he who inadvertently steps\r\non one of these animals may consider himself uncommonly fortunate if he\r\ncan effect his retreat without being wounded. But it is not merely in\r\nthese places, which seem assigned by nature for their abode, that\r\nloathsome reptiles are found: they creep between the roots of large\r\ntrees, under the thickly interwoven brushwood, on the open grass plots,\r\nand in the maize and sugar-cane fields of the Indians: nay, they crawl\r\neven into their huts, and most fortunate is it for the inhabitants of\r\nthose districts that the number of the venomous, compared with the\r\ninnoxious reptiles, is comparatively small. Of the poisonous serpents,\r\nonly a few kinds are known whose bite is attended with very dangerous\r\nconsequences. The _Miuamaru_, or _Jergon_ (_Lachesis picta_, Tsch.), is,\r\nat most, three feet long, with a broad, heart-shaped head, and a thick\r\nupper lip. It haunts the higher forests, while in those lower down his\r\nplace is filled by his no less fearful relative _Flammon_ (_Lachesis\r\nrhombeata_, Prince Max.), which is six or seven feet in length. These\r\nserpents are usually seen coiled almost in a circle, the head thrust\r\nforward, and the fierce, treacherous-looking eyes glaring around,\r\nwatching for prey, upon which they pounce with the swiftness of an\r\narrow; then, coiling themselves up again, they look tranquilly on the\r\ndeath-struggle of the victim. It would appear that these amphibia have\r\na perfect consciousness of the dreadful effect of their poisonous\r\nweapon, for they use it when they are neither attacked nor threatened,\r\nand they wound not merely animals fit for their food, but all that\r\ncome within their reach. More formidable than the two snakes just\r\ndescribed, but happily much less common, is the brown, ten-inch long\r\nviper.[93] It is brown, with two rows of black circular spots. The\r\neffect of its bite is so rapid, that it kills a strong man in two or\r\nthree minutes. So convinced are the natives of its inevitably fatal\r\nresult, that they never seek any remedy; but immediately on receiving\r\nthe wound, lay themselves down to die. In the Montañas of Pangoa this\r\nviper abounds more than in any other district, and never without\r\napprehension do the Cholos undertake their annual journey for the coca\r\nharvest, as they fear to fall victims to the bite of this viper. The\r\nwarning sound of the rattlesnake is seldom heard in the hot Montañas,\r\nand never in the higher regions.\r\n\r\nNature, who in almost all things has established an equilibrium,\r\nsupplies the natives with remedies against the bite of the serpent. One\r\nof the cures most generally resorted to is the root of the amarucachu\r\n(_Polianthes tuberosa_, L.), cut into slips and laid upon the wound.\r\nAnother is the juice of the creeping plant called vejuco de huaco\r\n(_Mikania Huaco_, Kth.), which is already very widely celebrated. This\r\nlatter remedy was discovered by the negroes of the equatorial province,\r\nChoco. They remarked that a sparrow-hawk, called the _huaco_, picked up\r\nsnakes for its principal food, and when bitten by one it flew to the\r\nvejuco and ate some of the leaves. At length the Indians thought of\r\nmaking the experiment on themselves, and when bitten by serpents they\r\ndrank the expressed juice of the leaves of the vejuco, and constantly\r\nfound that the wound was thereby rendered harmless. The use of this\r\nexcellent plant soon became general; and in some places the belief of\r\nthe preservative power of the vejuco juice was carried so far that men\r\nin good health were inoculated with it. In this process some spoonfuls\r\nof the expressed fluid are drunk, and afterwards some drops are put into\r\nincisions made in the hands, feet, and breast. The fluid is rubbed into\r\nthe wounds by fresh vejuco leaves. After this operation, according to\r\nthe testimony of persons worthy of credit, the bite of the poisonous\r\nsnake fails for a long time to have any evil effect. Besides the two\r\nplants mentioned above, many others are used with more or less favorable\r\nresults. The inhabitants of the Montaña also resort to other means,\r\nwhich are too absurd to be detailed here; yet their medicines are often\r\nof benefit, for their operation is violently reactive. They usually\r\nproduce the effect of repeated emetics, and cause great perspiration.\r\nThere is much difference in the modes of external treatment of the\r\nwound, and burning is often employed. I saw an Indian apply to his\r\nwife's foot, which had been bitten, a plaster, consisting of moist\r\ngunpowder, pulverised sulphur, and finely-chopped tobacco, mixed up\r\ntogether. He laid this over the wounded part and set fire to it. This\r\napplication, in connexion with one of the nausea-exciting remedies taken\r\ninwardly, had a successful result.\r\n\r\nInnoxious snakes[94] wind on tendrilled climbing plants, or lie like\r\nnecklaces of coral on the brown decayed leaves (_Elap. affinis_, Fitz.).\r\nWhere the branches of rivers enter the gloomy forests and form little\r\nnarrow lagunes, over which the high trees spread in vaulted cupolas\r\nalmost impervious to the light of day, there dwells the powerful giant\r\nsnake (_Eunectes murinus_, Wagl.), called by the Indians, in their\r\nfigurative language, _yacumaman_, \"mother of the waters.\" Stretched in\r\nlistless repose, or winding round the stem of an old tree, bathing her\r\ntail in the cool lagune, she watches wistfully for the animals of the\r\nforest who come to the waters to quench their thirst. Whilst she gazes\r\nat her distant prey, the fascinating power of her eyes seems to subdue\r\nthe trembling victim, and, unable even to attempt escape, he falls an\r\neasy sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe amphibia of the frog species, which lie concealed in silent repose\r\nduring the day, raise, after sunset, their far-sounding voices. The\r\nviolet colored throat-bladder (_Cystignathus silvestris_, Tsch.)\r\nmaintains his loud, uniform croak beneath the bushes, or penetrates into\r\nthe huts of the inhabitants. The _trapichero_, or sugar-mill frog, is a\r\nlarge species, almost half a foot in length. Its croak resembles very\r\nmuch the grating sound caused by the working of a sugar mill, for which\r\nreason the natives have given it the name of trapichero, or the\r\n_sugar-miller_. The croaking of these frogs, whose manifold tones blend\r\ntogether in confused union, augments not a little the distressing\r\ndreariness of a forest night.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous species of insects which swarm in these regions, few are\r\nremarkable for beauty; but many fix attention by their peculiar habits.\r\nThe bites and stings of numbers of them are very dangerous, and it\r\nrequires much caution to guard against their attacks.\r\n\r\nVariegated butterflies flutter noiselessly among the spreading branches\r\nof the trees, or sun themselves on the warm masses of fallen leaves. The\r\nmost remarkable of these butterflies is the large atlas, whose\r\nbrilliant blue tints shine out with lustrous radiance in the dim light\r\nof the forest. Along the banks of rivers, and especially in hot marshy\r\nspots, small musquitoes swarm. The bite of this animal produces an\r\nintolerable burning sensation, and often causes considerable\r\ninflammation. But more troublesome, and also much more numerous, are the\r\nstinging-flies (_sancudos_). On my first arrival in the Montaña, I lay\r\nseveral days exceedingly ill in consequence of severe swelling of the\r\nhead and limbs, caused by the bites of these insects. To the inhabitant\r\nof the forest the sancudos are an incessant torment. In no season of the\r\nyear, in no hour of the day or night, is there any respite from their\r\nattacks. Rubbing the body with unctuous substances, together with the\r\ncaustic juices of certain plants, and at night enclosing one's self in a\r\ntent made of _tucuyo_ (cotton cloth), or palm-tree bast, are the only\r\nmeans of protection against their painful stings. The clothes commonly\r\nworn are not sufficient, for they are perforated by the long sting of\r\nthe larger species, particularly of the much-dreaded\r\n_huir-pasimi-sancudo_ (Lip-gnat). Regularly every evening at twilight\r\nfresh swarms of these mischievous insects make their appearance.\r\n\r\nThe ticks (_ixodes_) are a class of insects destined by nature for the\r\nsuction of plants; but they often forsake trees, shrubs, and grasses, to\r\nfasten on man and other animals. With their long sharp stings they make\r\npunctures, in which they insert their heads, and thereby occasion very\r\npainful sores. These insects appear to have no preference for any\r\nparticular class of animals. They are often found on the hair of dead\r\nmammalia, and among the feathers of birds which have been shot; even the\r\ntoad, the frog, and the scaly lizard are not spared by them. Much more\r\ntroublesome than these insects are the antanas, which are not visible to\r\nthe naked eye. They penetrate the surface of the skin, and introduce\r\nthemselves beneath it, where they propagate with incredible rapidity;\r\nand when some thousands of them are collected together, a blackish spot\r\nappears, which quickly spreads. If these insects are not destroyed when\r\nthey first introduce themselves into the punctures, they multiply with\r\nincalculable rapidity, destroying the skin, and all the tender parts in\r\ncontact with it. Washing with brandy, which is often found to be a\r\nremedy against the less mischievous isancos, is not sufficient for the\r\nremoval of the antanas. For their extirpation the only effectual remedy\r\nis frequently bathing the part affected with a mixture of spirits of\r\nwine and corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\nWho can describe the countless myriads of ants which swarm through the\r\nforests? Every shrub is full of creeping life, and the decayed\r\nvegetation affords harbor for some peculiar kinds of these insects.\r\nThe large yellow _puca-çiçi_ is seen in multitudes in the open air,\r\nand it even penetrates into the dwellings. This insect does not bite,\r\nbut its crawling creates great irritation to the skin. The small black\r\n_yana-çiçi_, on the contrary, inflicts most painful punctures. A very\r\nmischievous species of stinging ant is the black _sunchiron_. This\r\ninsect inflicts a puncture with a long sting, which he carries in the\r\nrear of his body. The wound is exceedingly painful, and is sometimes\r\nattended by dangerous consequences. My travelling companion, C. Klee,\r\nbeing stung by one of these ants, suffered such severe pain and\r\nfever, that he was for a short while delirious. A few nights\r\nafterwards, a similar attack was made on myself during sleep. It\r\nsuddenly awoke me, and caused me to start up with a convulsive\r\nspring. I must confess that I never, in my whole life, experienced\r\nsuch severe pain as I did at that moment.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable phenomenon is exhibited by the swarms of the species\r\ncalled the _ñaui-huacan-çiçi_,[95] the great _wandering ant_. They\r\nappear suddenly in trains of countless myriads, and proceed forward in\r\na straight direction, without stopping. The small, the weak, and the\r\nneuters are placed in the centre, while the large and the strong flank\r\nthe army, and look out for prey. These swarms, called by the natives\r\n_Chacus_, sometimes enter a hut and clear it of all insects, amphibia,\r\nand other disagreeable guests. This work being accomplished, they again\r\nform themselves into a long train, and move onwards. The united force\r\nof these small creatures is vast, and there is no approach to the\r\nfabulous, when it is related that not only snakes, but also large\r\nmammalia, such as agoutis, armadillas, &c., on being surprised by\r\nthem, are soon killed. On the light dry parts of the higher Montañas we\r\nfind the large conical dwellings of the termes so firmly built, that\r\nthey are impenetrable even to rifle shot. They sometimes stand singly,\r\nsometimes together, in long lines. In form they strongly resemble the\r\nsimple, conical Puna huts.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the animal kingdom of these forest regions, which I have\r\nhere sketched only briefly and fragmentally, I must notice two insects,\r\nthe _Cucaracha_ and the _Chilicabra_, species of the Cockroach\r\n(_Blatta_). They are exceedingly numerous and troublesome. The\r\nCucaracha, which more particularly infests the deep regions of the\r\nforest, is an inch and a half long, and above half an inch broad; it is\r\nreddish brown, with a yellow neck. The Chilicabra, though smaller, is\r\nmore mischievous, by reason of its greater numbers. They settle in the\r\nhuts, where they destroy provisions, gnaw clothes, get into beds, and\r\ninto the dishes at meal time. These insects defy every precaution that\r\ncan be taken against their tormenting attacks. Luckily, nature has\r\nprovided enemies for their destruction. Among these is a small reddish\r\nyellow ant, called by the Indians, the _Pucchu-çiçi_, a useful member\r\nof the ant family, for it pursues and destroys the mischievous\r\ncockroaches. There is also a very elegant little bird, called the\r\n_Cucarachero_ (_Troglodytes audax_, Tsch.) which wages war against\r\nthese insects. On seizing one of them it first bites off the head, then\r\ndevours the body, and throws away the tough wings. These operations\r\nbeing completed, it hops to the nearest bush, and tunes its melodious\r\nsong, the sounds of which closely resemble the words \"_Acabe la\r\ntarea!_\" a name which the Indians give to this bird.[96] I could yet\r\nfill many pages with descriptions of insects which are dangerous or\r\ntroublesome, and among them are included the julus, measuring six\r\ninches in length, the large black and red scorpion, not forgetting the\r\nnumerous poisonous wasps and the cicadas. However, those which have\r\nbeen noticed will suffice to afford an idea of the ever-active\r\nmovements of animal life in the forests.\r\n\r\nWillingly would I take a view of the vegetation of the virgin forests,\r\nand attempt to sketch its progressive developments and alternations\r\nfrom the hilly Montañas of the eastern declivities of the Andes to the\r\nhumid level banks of the larger rivers; but I do not feel myself\r\ncompetent to undertake a labor to which former travellers intimately\r\nacquainted with the world of plants have already rendered full\r\njustice.[97] Being devoted to the study of zoology, and,\r\nunfortunately, too little familiar with botany, I have confined myself\r\nto a description of the general impression produced by the luxuriant\r\ngrowth of the soil, without entering into the individualities of the\r\nvegetation. In the more highly situated Montañas, where the cinchona\r\nis found in the place of its nativity, the gigantic orchidæ, the\r\nnumerous fern plants, the tree-like nettles, the wonderful bignonias,\r\nand the numerous, impenetrable complications of climbing plants,\r\npowerfully rivet the attention of the observer. Lower down, in the\r\nlighter forest soil, amidst numerous shrubs and climbers, the eye\r\ndelights to dwell on the manifold forms of the stately palm, on the\r\nterebinthaceæ, on the thickly-leaved balsam-yielding leguminosæ, on\r\nthe luxuriant laurels, on the pandaneæ or the large-leaved heliconias,\r\nand on the solaneæ, with their gigantic blossoms and thousands of\r\nflowers. Descending still further, the flat lands of the forest assume\r\na dark and gloomy aspect. The massive foliage of trees overarches\r\nstems which are the growth of centuries, and form a canopy almost\r\nimpervious to the light of day. On the slimy soil no small shrub\r\nuprears its head, no flowering plant unfolds its blossom. The mighty\r\ntrees stand alone, and erect in rows, like gravestones in a\r\nchurchyard; and the child of darkness--the rapidly-shooting\r\nmushroom--finds genial nurture on the warm humid earth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Bark-gatherers.

It has on the one side, and at a\r\nshort distance, the populous villages of the Sierra, and on the other it\r\nborders on the forests, through which the wild Indians range in their\r\nhunting excursions. It was formerly the principal key to the missionary\r\nstations of the Pampa del Sacramento, the Chanchamayo, Perenc, and Upper\r\nUcayali. It is only twenty leagues distant from Tarma, from whence the\r\nroad leads through the fertile valley Acobamba, to Palca. Eastward of\r\nthe latter place are the ruins of a fort, which in former times must\r\nhave been a place of considerable importance. The wild Indians have\r\nrepeatedly made hostile sallies from their forests, and it is only by\r\nthis bulwark, which, with four small field-pieces, completely defends\r\nthe narrow valley, that they have been checked in their advance on\r\nTarma. An exceedingly steep path runs about a league and a half up the\r\nacclivity; then, becoming somewhat more level, it extends to the base of\r\nthe crest, which at that part is about 14,000 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. Here the aspect of the Andes is by no means so imposing as that\r\nof the Cordillera, for the glaciers and steep rocky summits are wanting.\r\nThe highest peaks rise only about 200 feet above the crest. As in the\r\nCordillera, the eastern declivity inclines much more gently than the\r\nwestern, but the road is marshy, and is interspersed with large\r\nhollows, into which the mules often fall and are killed. After passing\r\nover the Andes, two leagues further, we come to the hacienda\r\nMaraynioc, where numerous herds of cattle are kept. Round the hacienda\r\nthere are potato plantations, and the potatoes reared here are so\r\nexcellent, that they are celebrated throughout the whole Sierra. Every\r\nmorning the sky is obscured by heavy clouds; it rains regularly two days\r\nin the week, and there are frequent falls of snow; yet notwithstanding\r\nthis excessive humidity, a bad harvest is an event never to be\r\napprehended. The cultivation of maize is, however, found to be\r\nimpracticable here, for soon after germination the ears rot. A small\r\nstream flows past the hacienda, and after a course of about three\r\nleagues, it reaches the Montaña de Vitoc. Formerly, the road ran close\r\nalong the bank of this stream, but in consequence of the repeated\r\ndepopulation of Vitoc, it became neglected, and at length impassable.\r\nThe way is now over the Cuchillo, or sharp edge of a mountain ridge, and\r\nit must be at least four times longer than the course formerly taken.\r\nFrom Maraynioc the road proceeds, for the length of a league, through a\r\nvalley overgrown with brushwood, and then rises to a lateral branch of\r\nthe Andes, which is almost as high as the main chain. The Indians call\r\nthis ridge, _Manam rimacunan_ (\"Thou shall not speak!\"), for a heavy\r\nwind, accompanied by drifting snow, blows constantly, and renders it\r\nscarcely possible to open the mouth to utter a word. From Manarimacunan,\r\ndownwards, to the lower Montaña, the road passes over stones laid in\r\n_echelon_ form, and through a very slippery hollow way, which descends\r\nrapidly downward, and is surrounded by almost impenetrable woods; the\r\nonly open and level place is the field of Chilpes, which is a few\r\nhundred paces long.\r\n\r\nHere it is highly interesting to contemplate the rapid increase of\r\nvegetation, and the varied changes in the animal world. From the brink\r\nof a ridge where only feeble vegetation can be seen, we descend a few\r\nleagues and speedily find ourselves in the region of the Cinchona tree,\r\nand in the evening we are among lofty palms. The first human dwellings\r\nseen on entering the Montaña are half a dozen small huts, forming the\r\nhamlet Amaruyo, formerly called Sibis, and immediately after we come to\r\nthe village of Vitoc. It consists of about fifty wretched huts, and has\r\na small church, in which worship is performed twice a year for the\r\ninhabitants of the whole valley.\r\n\r\nVitoc is surrounded by two rivers, which unite in a sharp angle, called\r\nthe Tingo, and which separate the valley from the territory of the wild\r\nIndians. The valley is deep, and the surrounding heights are broken by\r\nmany quebradas. The soil is very fruitful, and the locality is less than\r\nsome others infested with troublesome insects; yet it is but scantily\r\npeopled, for, besides the two villages and the Hacienda of Maraynioc,\r\nalready mentioned, it contains only a few scattered chacras. The\r\ninhabitants of this, the most favored district of the Montañas, scarcely\r\namount to 200. The villagers employ themselves chiefly in the\r\ncultivation of pines, which are sent to Lima. The Indians of Palca and\r\nTapo bring them potatoes, salt, and butcher's meat, for which the\r\nvillagers exchange their pine-apples. The fruit is conveyed by asses\r\nto the coast, where, however, it seldom arrives in good condition. The\r\nother productions of the Montaña are maize, oranges, bananas, paltas,\r\nSpanish pepper, &c.; but these articles are sold only in the Sierra.\r\nEach inhabitant of the village cultivates his own piece of ground,\r\nwhich he can enlarge when he pleases; but these people are too\r\nindolent to devote themselves seriously to agriculture. It is only\r\nwhen the governor in Tarma compels them to pay the annual\r\ncontribution, that they make an effort to augment their earnings; they\r\nthen seek a market for the products of their cultivation, and sell\r\nthem for ready money. Vitoc and some of the villages in its\r\nneighborhood form altogether only one ecclesiastical community, whose\r\npastor lives in Tarma the whole year round. He goes to Pucara only\r\nonce in six or eight months, to read a couple of masses, and to\r\nsolemnize marriages and christenings, but chiefly to collect fees for\r\nburials which may have taken place during his absence.\r\n\r\nThe plantation of Pacchapata is of considerable extent, but produces\r\nvery little. The system of repartimientos, already described, by which\r\nthe poor Indian is kept in a state of slavery by advances of clothing,\r\nmeat, brandy, &c., is practised in this hacienda to a great extent. The\r\nlaborer who is set down in the plantation-book as a debtor for ten or\r\ntwelve dollars, has a good chance of remaining during the rest of his\r\nlife a tributary slave; for if he tries by prolonged labor to relieve\r\nhimself from the debt the owner of the plantation causes brandy to be\r\nmade, and this is too great a temptation to be resisted by an Indian.\r\nThe butcher's meat given to the laboring Indians in general consists of\r\n_Chalonas_, that is, the dried flesh of sheep which have died in the\r\nhaciendas of the hilly districts. For a meagre, tough, unwholesome\r\nchalona the Indian has to add a dollar and a half or two dollars to his\r\ndebt, while a living sheep in the Sierra would not cost half the price.\r\nIt is the same with other articles furnished by the haciendas. European\r\nimportations, such as can be purchased at very low prices in the Sierra,\r\nare sold at high profits by the owners of plantations to the poor\r\nIndians, who have to repay them by long and severe labor.\r\n\r\nAt Pacchapata, besides maize, yuccas, and fruits, sugar, coffee, and\r\ncoca are also cultivated. The sugar-cane grows in abundance, and is of\r\ngood quality. An excellent kind of coffee is grown here; the bean is\r\nslightly globular, and its color is a greenish blue. In former times the\r\nviceroy used to send the coffee of Vitoc as a highly-esteemed present to\r\nthe court of Madrid. The coca is also very fine, and yields three\r\nharvests in the year; which, however, is only the case in a few of the\r\nMontañas, as, for example, at Pangoa and Huanta. I may here subjoin\r\nsome notice of this highly interesting plant.\r\n\r\nThe coca (_Erythroxylon coca_, Lam.) is a shrub about six feet in\r\nheight, with bright green leaves and white blossoms. The latter are\r\nsucceeded by small scarlet berries. It is raised from the seed, in\r\ngarden-beds called _almazigas_. When the young shoots are one and a half\r\nor two feet high, they are removed to regularly laid out coca fields\r\n(_cocales_), where they are planted at the distance of about three spans\r\nfrom each other. The coca requires humidity; therefore, during the first\r\nyear or two after it is planted in the fields, maize is sown between the\r\n_matas_, or young shoots, to screen them from the too great influence of\r\nthe sun. When the leaves are ripe, that is to say, when on being bent\r\nthey crack or break off, the gathering commences. The leaves are\r\nstripped from the branches, a task usually performed by women, and it\r\nrequires great care lest the tender leaves and young twigs should be\r\ninjured. In some districts, the Indians are so very careful in\r\ngathering the coca, that, instead of stripping off the leaves, they cut\r\nthem from the stem by making an incision with their nails. The plant\r\nthus rendered leafless is soon again overgrown with verdant foliage.\r\nAfter being gathered, the leaves are spread out on coarse woollen cloths\r\nand dried in the sun. The color of the leaves when dried is a pale\r\ngreen. The drying is an operation which likewise demands great care\r\nand attention, for if the leaves imbibe damp, they become dark\r\ncolored, and then they sell for a much lower price than when they are\r\ngreen. The dry coca is finely packed in woollen sacks, and covered\r\nwith sand. These sacks are of various sizes and colors, in different\r\nparts of the Montañas. In Huanuco they are grey or black, and when\r\nfilled weigh from 75 to 80 pounds. In Vitoc they are grey and white,\r\nand contain 150 pounds. In Huanta and Anco they are small in size, and\r\nblack or brown in color, and contain merely one aroba. In the Montañas\r\nof Urubamba, Calca, and Paucartambo, the coca leaves are put into\r\nsmall baskets called _cestos_, and covered with sand. Great care is\r\nalso requisite in the carriage of the coca, for if damp be allowed to\r\npenetrate the sack, the leaves become hot, or as the natives express\r\nit, _Se calientan_, and are thereby rendered useless.\r\n\r\nThe Indians masticate the coca. Each individual carries a leathern\r\npouch, called the _huallqui_, or the _chuspa_, and a small flask gourd,\r\ncalled the _ishcupuru_. The pouch contains a supply of coca leaves, and\r\nthe gourd is filled with pulverised unslaked lime. Usually four times,\r\nbut never less than three times a day, the Indian suspends his labor,\r\nfor the purpose of masticating coca. This operation (which is termed\r\n_chacchar_ or _acullicar_) is performed in the following manner: some of\r\nthe coca leaves, the stalks having been carefully picked off, are\r\nmasticated until they form a small ball, or as it is called an\r\n_acullico_. A thin slip of damp wood is then thrust into the\r\n_ishcupuru_, or gourd, and when drawn out some portion of the powdered\r\nlime adheres to it. The _acullico_, or ball of masticated coca leaves,\r\nis, whilst still lying in the mouth, punctured with this slip of wood,\r\nuntil the lime mixing with it, gives it a proper relish, and the\r\nabundant flow of saliva thus excited is partly expectorated and partly\r\nswallowed. When the ball ceases to emit juice, it is thrown away, and\r\na new one is formed by the mastication of a fresh mouthfull of coca\r\nleaves. In Cerro de Pasco, and in places still further south, the\r\nIndians use, instead of unslaked lime, a preparation of the pungent\r\nashes of the quinua (_Chenopodium Quinua_, L.). This preparation is\r\ncalled _Llucta_ or _Llipta_. In using it a piece is broken off and\r\nmasticated along with the _acullico_. In some of the Montaña regions\r\nthe Llucta is made from the ashes of the musa root. The application of\r\nthe unslaked lime demands some precaution, for if it comes in direct\r\ncontact with the lips and gums, it causes a very painful burning.\r\nDuring a fatiguing ride across the level heights, where, owing to the\r\ncold wind, I experienced a difficulty of respiration, my Arriero\r\nrecommended me to chew coca, assuring me that I would experience great\r\nrelief from so doing. He lent me his _huallqui_, but owing to my\r\nawkward manner of using it, I cauterized my lips so severely that I\r\ndid not venture on a second experiment.\r\n\r\nThe flavor of coca is not unpleasant. It is slightly bitter, aromatic,\r\nand similar to the worst kind of green tea. When mixed with the ashes of\r\nthe musa root it is somewhat piquant, and more pleasant to European\r\npalates than it is without that addition. The smell of the fresh dried\r\nleaves in a mass is almost overpowering; but this smell entirely goes\r\nwhen they are packed in the sacks. All who masticate coca have a very\r\nbad breath, pale lips and gums, greenish and stumpy teeth, and an ugly\r\nblack mark at the angles of the mouth. An inveterate _coquero_, or coca\r\nchewer, is known at the first glance. His unsteady gait, his\r\nyellow-colored skin, his dim and sunken eyes encircled by a purple ring,\r\nhis quivering lips and his general apathy, all bear evidence of the\r\nbaneful effects of the coca juice when taken in excess. All the mountain\r\nIndians are addicted more or less to the practice of masticating coca.\r\nEach man consumes, on the average, between an ounce and an ounce and a\r\nhalf per day, and on festival days about double that quantity. The\r\nowners of mines and plantations allow their laborers to suspend their\r\nwork three times a day for the _chacchar_, which usually occupies\r\nupwards of a quarter of an hour; and after that they smoke a paper\r\ncigar, which they allege crowns the zest of the coca mastication. He\r\nwho indulges for a time in the use of coca finds it difficult, indeed\r\nalmost impossible, to relinquish it. This fact I saw exemplified in\r\nthe cases of several persons of high respectability in Lima, who are\r\nin the habit of retiring daily to a private apartment for the purpose\r\nof masticating coca. They could not do this openly, because among the\r\nrefined class of Peruvians the chacchar is looked upon as a low and\r\nvulgar practice, befitting only to the laboring Indians. Yet,\r\nEuropeans occasionally allow themselves to fall into this habit; and I\r\nknew two in Lima, the one an Italian and the other a Biscayan, who\r\nwere confirmed coqueros in the strictest sense of the word. In Cerro\r\nde Pasco there are societies having even Englishmen for their members,\r\nwhich meet on certain evenings for the chacchar. In these places,\r\ninstead of lime or ashes, sugar is served along with the coca leaves.\r\nA member of one of these clubs informed me that on the few first\r\ntrials the sugar was found very agreeable, but that afterwards the\r\npalate required some more pungent ingredient.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the coca is similar to that of narcotics administered\r\nin small doses. Its effects may be compared to those produced by the\r\nthorn-apple rather than to those arising from opium. I have already\r\nnoticed the consequences resulting from drinking the decoction of the\r\ndatura.[98] In the inveterate coquero similar symptoms are observable,\r\nbut in a mitigated degree. I may mention one circumstance attending the\r\nuse of coca, which appears hitherto to have escaped notice: it is,\r\nthat after the mastication of a great quantity of coca the eye seems\r\nunable to bear light, and there is a marked distension of the pupil. I\r\nhave also observed this peculiarity of the eye in one who had drunk a\r\nstrong extract of the infusion of coca leaves. In the effects\r\nconsequent on the use of opium and coca there is this distinction,\r\nthat coca, when taken even in the utmost excess, never causes a total\r\nalienation of the mental powers or induces sleep; but, like opium, it\r\nexcites the sensibility of the brain, and the repeated excitement,\r\noccasioned by its intemperate use after a series of years, wears out\r\nmental vigor and activity.\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact, confirmed by long observation and experience,\r\nthat the Indians who regularly masticate coca require but little food,\r\nand, nevertheless, go through excessive labor with apparent ease. They,\r\ntherefore, ascribe the most extraordinary qualities to the coca, and\r\neven believe that it might be made entirely a substitute for food.\r\nSetting aside all extravagant and visionary notions on the subject, I am\r\nclearly of opinion that the moderate use of coca is not merely\r\ninnoxious, but that it may even be very conducive to health. In support\r\nof this conclusion, I may refer to the numerous examples of longevity\r\namong Indians who, almost from the age of boyhood, have been\r\nin the habit of masticating coca three times a day, and who in the\r\ncourse of their lives have consumed no less than two thousand seven\r\nhundred pounds, yet, nevertheless, enjoy perfect health.[99] The food of\r\nthe Indians consists almost exclusively of vegetable substances,\r\nespecially roasted maize and barley converted into flour by crushing,\r\nwhich they eat without the admixture of any other substance. The\r\ncontinued use of this farinaceous food occasions severe obstructions,\r\nwhich the well known aperient qualities of the coca counteract, and many\r\nserious diseases are thereby prevented. That the coca is in the highest\r\ndegree nutritious, is a fact beyond dispute. The incredible fatigues\r\nendured by the Peruvian infantry, with very spare diet, but with the\r\nregular use of coca; the laborious toil of the Indian miner, kept up,\r\nunder similar circumstances, throughout a long series of years;\r\ncertainly afford sufficient ground for attributing to the coca leaves,\r\nnot a quality of mere temporary stimulus, but a powerful nutritive\r\nprinciple. Of the great power of the Indians in enduring fatigue with no\r\nother sustenance than coca, I may here mention an example. A Cholo of\r\nHuari, named Hatun Huamang, was employed by me in very laborious\r\ndigging. During the whole time he was in my service, viz., five days and\r\nnights, he never tasted any food, and took only two hours' sleep\r\nnightly. But at intervals of two and a half or three hours, he regularly\r\nmasticated about half an ounce of coca leaves, and he kept an acullico\r\ncontinually in his mouth. I was constantly beside him, and therefore I\r\nhad the opportunity of closely observing him. The work for which I\r\nengaged him being finished, he accompanied me on a two days' journey of\r\ntwenty-three leagues across the level heights. Though on foot, he kept\r\nup with the pace of my mule, and halted only for the _chacchar_. On\r\nleaving me, he declared that he would willingly engage himself again for\r\nthe same amount of work, and that he would go through it without food if\r\nI would but allow him a sufficient supply of coca. The village priest\r\nassured me that this man was sixty-two years of age, and that he had\r\nnever known him to be ill in his life.\r\n\r\nThe Indians maintain that coca is the best preventive of that difficulty\r\nof respiration felt in the rapid ascents of the Cordillera and the Puna.\r\nOf this fact I was fully convinced by my own personal experience. I\r\nspeak here, not of the mastication of the leaves, but of their decoction\r\ntaken as a beverage. When I was in the Puna, at the height of 14,000\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, I drank, always before going out to\r\nhunt, a strong infusion of coca leaves. I could then during the whole\r\nday climb the heights and follow the swift-footed wild animals without\r\nexperiencing any greater difficulty of breathing than I should have felt\r\nin similar rapid movement on the coast. Moreover, I did not suffer from\r\nthe symptoms of cerebral excitement or uneasiness which other travellers\r\nhave observed. The reason perhaps is, that I only drank this decoction\r\nin the cold Puna, where the nervous system is far less susceptible than\r\nin the climate of the forests. However, I always felt a sense of great\r\nsatiety after taking the coca infusion, and I did not feel a desire for\r\nmy next meal until after the time at which I usually took it.\r\n\r\nBy the Peruvian Indians the coca plant is regarded as something sacred\r\nand mysterious, and it sustained an important part in the religion of\r\nthe Incas. In all ceremonies, whether religious or warlike, it was\r\nintroduced, for producing smoke at the great offerings, or as the\r\nsacrifice itself. During divine worship the priests chewed coca leaves,\r\nand unless they were supplied with them, it was believed that the favor\r\nof the gods could not be propitiated. It was also deemed necessary that\r\nthe supplicator for divine grace should approach the priests with an\r\n_Acullico_ in his mouth. It was believed that any business undertaken\r\nwithout the benediction of coca leaves could not prosper; and to the\r\nshrub itself worship was rendered. During an interval of more than 300\r\nyears Christianity has not been able to subdue the deep-rooted idolatry;\r\nfor everywhere we find traces of belief in the mysterious power of this\r\nplant. The excavators in the mines of Cerro de Pasco throw masticated\r\ncoca on hard veins of metal, in the belief that it softens the ore, and\r\nrenders it more easy to work. The origin of this custom is easily\r\nexplained, when it is recollected, that in the time of the Incas it was\r\nbelieved that the _Coyas_, or the deities of metals, rendered the\r\nmountains impenetrable, if they were not propitiated by the odor of\r\ncoca. The Indians, even at the present time, put coca leaves into the\r\nmouths of dead persons, to secure to them a favorable reception on their\r\nentrance into another world, and when a Peruvian Indian on a journey\r\nfalls in with a mummy, he, with timid reverence, presents to it some\r\ncoca leaves as his pious offering.\r\n\r\nSoon after the conquest of Peru, when the Spaniards treated the Indians\r\nand all their customs with contempt, coca became an object of aversion\r\nto the whites. The reverence rendered by the natives to the coca plant\r\ninduced the Spaniards to believe that it possessed some demoniacal\r\ninfluence. The officers of the government and the clergy, therefore,\r\nendeavored, by all possible means, to extirpate its use, and this is one\r\ncause, hitherto overlooked, of the hatred with which the Indians\r\nregarded the Spaniards. In the second council held at Lima, in 1567,\r\ncoca was described \"as a worthless object, fitted for the misuse and\r\nsuperstition of the Indians;\" and a royal decree of October 18, 1569,\r\nexpressly declares that the notions entertained by the natives that coca\r\ngives them strength, is an \"illusion of the devil\" (_una elusion del\r\nDemonio_). The Peruvian mine owners were the first to discover the\r\nimportance of the _chacchar_ in assisting the Indians to go through\r\ntheir excessive labor, and they, together with the plantation owners,\r\nbecame the most earnest defenders of coca. The consequence was, that, in\r\ndefiance of royal and ecclesiastical ordinances, its use increased\r\nrather than diminished. One of the warmest advocates of the plant was\r\nthe Jesuit Don Antonio Julian, who, in a work entitled, \"Perla de\r\nAmerica,\" laments that coca is not introduced into Europe instead of\r\ntea and coffee. \"It is,\" he observes, \"melancholy to reflect that the\r\npoor of Europe cannot obtain this preservative against hunger and\r\nthirst; that our working people are not supported by this strengthening\r\nplant in their long-continued labors.\"[100] In the year 1793, Dr. Don\r\nPedro Nolasco Crespo pointed out in a treatise the important advantages\r\nthat would be derived from the use of the coca plant, if introduced into\r\nthe European navies, and he expresses a wish that experiments of its\r\nutility in that way could be tried. Though it is not probable that Dr.\r\nCrespo's wish will ever be realized, yet there is little doubt that the\r\nuse of coca as a beverage on board ship would be attended with very\r\nbeneficial results. It would afford a nutritious refreshment to seamen\r\nin the exercise of their laborious duties, and would greatly assist in\r\ncounteracting the unwholesome effects of salt provisions. As a stimulant\r\nit would be far less injurious than ardent spirits, for which it might\r\nbe substituted without fear of any of the evil consequences experienced\r\nby the _coqueros_. After a long and attentive observation of the effects\r\nof coca, I am fully convinced that its use, in moderation, is no way\r\ndetrimental to health; and that without it the Peruvian Indian, with his\r\nspare diet, would be incapable of going through the labor which he now\r\nperforms. The coca plant must be considered as a great blessing to Peru.\r\nIt is an essential means of preserving the nationality of the Indians,\r\nand in some measure mitigating the melancholy fate of that once great\r\nrace which disease and excessive labor now threaten to destroy.\r\n\r\nIn former times the cultivation of coca in the Montaña de Vitoc was very\r\nconsiderable. Upwards of 4,000 arobas used to be annually forwarded to\r\nthe market of Tarma. Now only fifty arobas are sent. Vitoc produces no\r\nfodder for horses or mules; those animals, therefore, are very lean and\r\nfeeble in this district, and are usually unfit for work after two years.\r\nIndeed, they suffer so much from the attacks of the blood-sucking bat\r\nand the gad-fly (_tabano_), that after being only a few weeks in the\r\nMontaña de Vitoc, their strength is exhausted, and they are scarcely\r\nable to reach the Puna. Black cattle, on the contrary, thrive\r\nexcellently; but it is not possible to keep up herds, for the young\r\ncalves are all devoured by the numerous animals of prey. The llamas,\r\nwhich the Cholos bring from Tapo to Vitoc, are so enfeebled and overcome\r\nby the journey, that on the second day after their arrival it is often\r\nfound necessary to send them to a colder district.\r\n\r\nIn this Montaña the large animals of prey seldom approach human\r\nhabitations, though sometimes the ounce pays them a visit, and the\r\nCuguar descends from the Ceja. Other animals of the feline genus are\r\nvery numerous, and their depredations render it impossible to breed\r\npoultry. Even the fabulous animal, called the _carbunculo_, is said to\r\nhave been seen oftener than once in Vitoc. In almost every place I\r\nvisited on the coast, in the Sierra, and in the Montañas, extraordinary\r\nstories concerning this animal were related; and many persons even\r\nassured me they had seen him. The carbunculo is represented to be of the\r\nsize of a fox, with long black hair, and is only visible at night, when\r\nit slinks slowly through the thickets. If followed, he opens a flap or\r\nvalve in the forehead, from under which an extraordinary, brilliant, and\r\ndazzling light issues. The natives believe that this light proceeds from\r\na brilliant precious stone, and that any fool hardy person who may\r\nventure to grasp at it rashly is blinded; then the flap is let down, and\r\nthe animal disappears in the darkness. Such are the stories related by\r\nthe Indians; and it appears that the belief of the existence of the\r\ncarbunculo has prevailed in Peru from the earliest times, and certainly\r\nbefore the conquest, so that its introduction cannot be attributed to\r\nthe Spaniards. It is even prevalent among many of the wild Indian\r\ntribes, by whom the early missionaries were told the stories which they\r\nin their turn repeated about the animal. As yet nobody has been\r\nfortunate enough to capture such an animal, though the Spaniards always\r\nshowed themselves very desirous to obtain possession of the precious\r\njewel; and the viceroys, in their official instructions to the\r\nmissionaries, placed the carbunculo in the first order of desiderata.\r\nWhat animal may have served as a foundation for those fabulous stories,\r\nit is certainly difficult to decide; probably a different one in each\r\nparticular district. On the coast it may have been the _añash_ (one of\r\nthe mephitic animals), which seeks for his food only at night. I have\r\noften observed for a moment a singularly brilliant flashing in the eyes\r\nof that animal when irritated.\r\n\r\nThe worst enemies of the delightful Montaña de Vitoc are the wild\r\nIndians, who are only separated from the Christian Indians by the two\r\nrivers Aynamayo and Tullumayo. They belong to the ferocious race of the\r\n_Chunchos_, and in their savage manners they somewhat resemble the\r\nCasibos and Campas. They have their chief residence in Chibatizo, nine\r\nleagues from Pucara. Only three leagues from Pacchapata, at the\r\nconfluence of the Chanchamayo and Tullumayo, they have a pretty large\r\nvillage; and Palmapata, which they temporarily took possession of, is\r\nsituated still nearer. They frequently extend their hunting excursions\r\nto the banks of the great rivers, and make inroads upon the territory of\r\nVitoc, cruelly murdering all the Cholos they meet with. Any kind of\r\nfriendly intercourse with them is impracticable. I took some pains to\r\naccomplish that object, but without success. While they were on their\r\nhunting expeditions I have left in their huts knives, fish-hooks,\r\near-rings, and other things. In return for these presents they left for\r\nme some of their edible roots, among which were yuccas, but all were\r\npoisoned, so that, had we not observed caution, I and my venturous\r\ncompanion, Klee, might have fallen victims to the treachery of these\r\nIndians. The Chunchos, when on their expeditions, are almost in a state\r\nof nudity. Sometimes they wear a short whitish-brown shirt without\r\nsleeves. This garment, when worn by the chiefs, is red. Most of them dye\r\ntheir hair with achote (_Bixa Orellana_, L.), a deep vermilion, and\r\npaint the face and breast of the same color. Their weapons consist of a\r\nbow of chonta (_Guilielma speciosa_), with which they use two kinds of\r\narrows. One kind are very long, with round points and barbs of chonta;\r\nthe others are shorter, and have points made of reed, which inflict deep\r\nwounds, very difficult to be healed. They also use the great wooden\r\nsword, the _macana_. A cross having been put up in the forest, they\r\nfastened to it a few days afterwards a macana and two arrows, as\r\nsymbols of irreconcilable enmity to Christians. Their warlike instrument\r\nis a reed, two feet long and four inches broad, through which their\r\nhowlings resound in horrible discord.\r\n\r\nIt is a custom with the inhabitants of Vitoc to undertake two\r\nexpeditions every year against the Chunchos. They are the most laughable\r\nenterprises imaginable. All the Cholos of the valley, with the Alcalde\r\nat their head, or rather in the midst of them, proceed, armed with\r\nsticks, axes, forest knives, and _two_ muskets,[101] to explore the banks\r\nof both rivers. The front ranks advance with drums beating, and a number\r\nof Indians carry large calabashes filled with guarapo, to which they pay\r\ntheir earnest devotions every half hour. When by accident some of the\r\nChunchos are seen, the Cholos fly with all the rapidity that terror can\r\ninspire, and cannot be got together again till they reach their village;\r\nthen they raise a tremendous shout, and when safe in their dwellings\r\nboast proudly of their heroic deeds.\r\n\r\nThe Chunchos are in possession of a very rich bed of salt, some twelve\r\nor fourteen leagues from Vitoc, from whence they permit the neighboring\r\ntribes with whom they are at peace, to supply themselves with salt.\r\nHostile tribes, such as the Campas and the Callisecas, sometimes attempt\r\nto carry away salt, and then a sanguinary contest ensues. This stratum\r\nof salt comes from the top of a hill, called the Cerro de la Sal, and it\r\nruns in the direction from south-west to north-east, to the length of\r\nnearly three leagues, covering a breadth of about thirty ells. The salt\r\nis mixed with red earth. It is probably a continuation of the great salt\r\nbed of Maynas, stretching eastward along the left bank of the Perene. It\r\nmay be presumed that it does not extend as far as the immense Pajonal,\r\nas the Campas go for their salt to the Cerro de la Sal.\r\n\r\nIn former times various attempts were made to convert the Chunchos to\r\nChristianity; and these attempts were partially successful. The first\r\nmissionary who ventured among them was the intrepid Fray Geronimo\r\nXimenes. In 1635 he penetrated from Huancabamba to the Cerro de la Sal,\r\nand there preached the gospel in the language of the people. He built a\r\nchapel, and then directed his course south-west to Vitoc, where he\r\nfounded the village San Buenaventura. Two years after he embarked on the\r\nChanchamayo, with the intention of extending his mission to the Campas\r\ntribe, by whom he was killed, together with his companion, Fray\r\nChristoval Larios, and twenty-eight other Spaniards. Several\r\nmissionaries subsequently proceeded to the Cerro de la Sal, and found\r\nfavor with the natives, so that in 1640 they had no less than seven\r\nvillages of converted Chunchos, Amagas, and Campas; but only a few years\r\nafterwards all the missionaries and soldiers were killed and the chapels\r\nwere destroyed. The Franciscan monks, inspired by their indefatigable\r\nzeal, ventured in 1671, on a new mission to the fatal Cerro de la Sal;\r\nand they had the good fortune to found a village in which eight hundred\r\nNeophytes were collected. A second and smaller village was founded in\r\nthe vicinity of the destroyed San Buenaventura, and named Santa Rosa de\r\nQuimiri; but the avarice of some Spaniards who fancied there were gold\r\nmines in the Cerro de la Sal, induced them to get the missions withdrawn\r\nfrom the superintendence of the priests, and to turn the whole into a\r\npolitical system. Then commenced the oppression of the Indians in those\r\nparts. The consequence was a great insurrection in 1674, when all the\r\nwhites were massacred. Thus were the labors of the missionaries a second\r\ntime annihilated. Every attempt for the conversion of Indians was for a\r\nlong time fruitless, and the missionaries who ventured to approach them\r\nwere shot. After the lapse of about thirty years, during which interval\r\nthe Chunchos had fallen back to their original savage state, the founder\r\nof the Convent of Ocopa, Fray Francisco de San Jose, with four priests\r\nand two lay brothers, penetrated into the valley of Vitoc, and entered\r\nupon the territory of the Chunchos. At this time (1709) Vitoc was first\r\npeopled, and in the course of twenty years six large villages were\r\nbuilt. In the year 1739 these missions, again flourishing, counted ten\r\nChristian villages and three thousand baptized Indians. Three years\r\nafterwards the Indian insurrection, headed by the apostate Juan Santos,\r\ndestroyed all the missions of Central Peru.\r\n\r\nJuan Santos was an Indian born at Huamanga, and he claimed descent from\r\nthe last of the Incas. This claim was probably well founded, for before\r\nthe revolt he was called Atahuallpa, which was the name of the Inca put\r\nto death by Pizarro. Juan Santos was haughty, high spirited, and clever.\r\nIn the year 1741 he killed, in a quarrel, a Spaniard of high rank, and\r\nto elude the pursuit of justice, he fled to the forests. There he\r\nbrooded over plans for taking vengeance on the oppressors of his\r\ncountry. He first addressed himself to the tribes of the Campas, and\r\nhaving gained them over, he proceeded to Quisopongo in the Pajonal. From\r\nthence, in the year 1742, he made his first attack on the mission of the\r\nCerro de la Sal. The Spaniards had already been warned of the intended\r\nrising, but they considered it too unimportant to call for serious\r\nmeasures of repression; and whilst lulling themselves in their imagined\r\nsecurity, they were surprised and massacred by the Indians. The\r\ninsurrection spread with incredible rapidity. Juan Santos himself led\r\nall the principal attacks. In one night he took the fortress of Quimiri\r\nwith sixty-five men, all of whom were massacred in the most cruel\r\nmanner. The well-defended fort of Paucartambo was next taken by a small\r\nnumber of Chunchos, commanded by Juan Santos. All the Christian churches\r\nwere destroyed by the insurgents. The sacred images and the priests were\r\ntied together, and cast into the rivers; the villages were burned, and\r\nthe cultivated fields laid waste. The number of Spanish soldiers killed\r\nin this insurrection was 245; the number of priests, 26. In the course\r\nof a few weeks all the missions of central Peru were completely\r\ndestroyed, and terror spread even to the mountains. The Spanish\r\ngovernment found it necessary to adopt the most vigorous measures, for\r\nthere was reason to fear that the mountain Indians would revolt. Castles\r\nand forts were built on the frontiers of all the Montañas and strongly\r\ngarrisoned; but the insurrection did not extend further. The ultimate\r\nfate of Juan Santos Atahuallpa has never been satisfactorily\r\nascertained. Some assert that he became a powerful ruler, and that as\r\nlong as he lived the races of the Chunchos, Pacañes, Chichirrenes,\r\nCampas, and Simirinches, were united. On an old manuscript in the\r\nmonastery of Ocopa I found a marginal note, in which it was said, \"As to\r\nthe monster, the apostate Juan Santos Atahuallpa, after his diabolical\r\ndestruction of our missions, the wrath of God was directed against him\r\nin the most fearful manner. He died the death of Herod, for his living\r\nbody was devoured by worms.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the tragical downfall of these missions, two priests, Fra\r\nFrancisco Otasua and Fray Salvador Pando, visited the ruins of Quimiri,\r\nand endeavored to conciliate the rebels; but in vain. After three\r\nmonths, during which they suffered dreadful ill treatment from the\r\nChunchos, they returned to the monastery of Ocopa.\r\n\r\nThese missionaries were all monks of the order of San Francisco. Their\r\nactive zeal and heroic submission to any sacrifice in furtherance of the\r\ncause in which they were embarked must excite at once astonishment and\r\nadmiration. Undaunted by incredible privations and laborious exertions\r\nin the pathless forests, without food or shelter; undismayed by the\r\ncontinual apprehension of a violent and cruel death, they courageously\r\nobeyed the inward impulse which inspired them to preach the gospel to\r\nthe wild Indians. When intelligence was received of the violent death of\r\none of the brotherhood, others immediately offered to supply the place\r\nof the victim, and the superiors of the order had much difficulty in\r\nrestraining the zealous monks. In the central and northern missions of\r\nPeru, 129 Franciscan monks were murdered by the wild Indians. Those\r\nwho compose that number are recorded by name, but many others\r\ndisappeared without leaving a trace of what had become of them, and of\r\ncourse they are not included in the list. The number of lay brethren\r\nwho perished is much greater. It is indeed melancholy to reflect how\r\nlittle advantage has been obtained by the sacrifice of so many\r\nvaluable lives. The missions have nearly all disappeared, and the\r\nIndians have now retrograded into the savage state in which they were\r\nbefore the conquest of Peru.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscan monks were mild and patient teachers. They proceeded on\r\nthe principle of leaving the Christian religion to act for itself, and\r\nthey scorned to promote it by any kind of compulsion. The Dominicans, on\r\nthe other hand, who came to Peru with the conquerors, preached\r\nChristianity with fire and sword. The Jesuits, who headed the missions\r\nof Southern Peru, adopted the one way or the other, as they found most\r\nadvantageous to the object they had in view. By this means they secured\r\nthe attachment of the neophytes, and retained most of their conversions.\r\nMany of the Jesuit missionaries were highly intelligent and\r\nwell-informed men. We are indebted to them for important geographical\r\nand statistical information, and in particular for some philological\r\nworks of great value, viz., a grammar and dictionary of the language of\r\nevery tribe they converted. The Dominican monks, who were mere ignorant\r\nfanatics, sacrificed to their blind zeal for conversion all the\r\nmonuments of the early civilization of the Peruvians, and restrained,\r\nrather than promoted, the intellectual development of the people. The\r\nFranciscans, animated by pious inspiration, earnestly preached the\r\ndoctrines of Christ to the wild inhabitants of the distant forests; but\r\nthey communicated little information to the rest of world. A few\r\nimperfect maps, and some scanty notices on the manners and customs of\r\nthe Indians, are the whole amount of their laical labors.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1779 an attempt was again made to penetrate to the Cerro de\r\nla Sal, and a road was opened leading from Palca to Chanchamayo, where a\r\nfort was built; but at the expiration of five years the government\r\ndestroyed it, as continued irruptions of the Chunchos could not be\r\nchecked. In 1784, the governor of Tarma, Don Juan Maria de Galvas,\r\nsupported by the Superior of Ocopa, Fray Manuel Sobreviela, visited the\r\nvalley of Vitoc, which had been abandoned since the Indian insurrection.\r\nThe new village of San Teodoro de Pucara was founded, and the destroyed\r\nfort, Santa Ana de Colla, was rebuilt. The Montaña was soon peopled, and\r\nin a short time it contained upwards of forty haciendas and large\r\nchacras. The village of Sorriano, scarcely two leagues from Colla, was\r\nthen inhabited by Chunchos, who showed a willingness to maintain\r\nfriendly intercourse with the occupants of Vitoc, from whom they took\r\nmeat, tools, and other things, which they repaid by agricultural labor.\r\nUnfortunately, the plantation owners soon began to take an undue\r\nadvantage of this friendly intercourse, and to charge exorbitant prices\r\nfor the articles required by the Indians. For a pin or a needle they\r\ndemanded two days' work, for a fishing-hook four, and for a wretched\r\nknife, eight, ten, or more. A rupture was the consequence. The Chunchos\r\nburned their own village, and returned again to Chanchamayo. Still,\r\nhowever, they continued on a sort of amicable footing with the Cholos,\r\nuntil one of the latter wantonly shot a Chuncho at a festival. The tribe\r\nthen mustered in thousands to avenge the murder. They destroyed the\r\nChristian villages, and massacred all the inhabitants who were not able\r\nto fly. Thus was Vitoc once more depopulated: Cardenas, the military\r\ngovernor of Tarma, made a fresh endeavor to restore the cultivation of\r\nthis fine valley. He made the road again passable, laid out the large\r\nplantation Chuntabamba, built and garrisoned the Colla fort. The site of\r\nthe former Chuncho village, Sorriano, was converted into a _cocal_ (or\r\ncoca field), and the Montaña began once more to assume a flourishing\r\naspect. Still, however, the Chunchos continued to harass their\r\nneighbors, particularly during the time of the coca harvest, which could\r\nnot be gathered without military protection. During one of the harvests\r\na laborer was shot by the wild Indians, which so terrified the Cholos,\r\nthat they all fled to Sorriano. Soon after, Cardenas died, and the coca\r\nplantation being neglected, became a waste. A few years afterwards the\r\nhacienda of Pacchapata was laid out. During the war of independence the\r\nSpaniards destroyed Fort Colla, and the inhabitants of Vitoc were left\r\nwithout any means of defence against their savage enemies. The last\r\nattempt to reduce the Chunchos to subjection and order was made by a\r\nmilitary expedition under the command of General Don Francisco de Paula\r\nde Otero, but owing to ill-arranged plans it totally failed. No more\r\nthan twenty-five years have elapsed since the valley of Vitoc, with its\r\nrich plantations, was in the most flourishing prosperity. Now only faint\r\ntraces of its past cultivation are discernible.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Montaña of Vitoc is the history of all the Montañas\r\nof Peru. In all, we perceive the alternate rise and decline of\r\ncultivation and civilization, caused by the efforts of the missionaries,\r\nand the incursions of the wild Indians. Throughout all these districts\r\nthe present condition exhibits a marked inferiority to the past, a\r\ncircumstance which may be accounted for by the long-continued civil war,\r\nduring the contest for independence. Nevertheless, the internal\r\ntranquillity of the country, and the increasing population, suggest\r\nfavorable prognostics for the future.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: See page 189.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: I allude here to individuals (and such cases are by no\r\nmeans singular) who have attained the great age of 130.

We find, indeed, an uninterrupted series of\r\nrevolutions and wars, arising out of the continued extension of the\r\nempire, to which nations differing one from another in language,\r\nreligion, and manners, were gradually annexed. For some time after their\r\nsubjugation these nations struggled to recover their independence, but\r\nthe wise and mild government of the Incas gradually restored peace, and\r\nestablished unity. In course of time, the magnitude of the empire led to\r\nits downfall. Huayna Inca-Capac divided his dominions between his two\r\nsons. To the elder, Huascar, he gave the southern portion of the empire,\r\nand to the younger, Atahuallpa, he gave the northern division. Between\r\nthe two brothers there arose disputes, which led to a sanguinary war;\r\nand in that fatal interval, Pizarro, with his invading forces, landed in\r\nPeru. With a degree of speed, which internal union among the people\r\nwould have rendered impossible, the Spaniards made themselves masters of\r\nthe country, massacred alike sovereigns and subjects, destroyed the\r\nsanctuaries, and established a new religion and new laws. The barbarous\r\ncruelties by which that religion and those laws were upheld are too well\r\nknown to require repetition here. Of the many oppressive measures to\r\nwhich the Spaniards enforced submission from the conquered people, I\r\nwill briefly notice two: the _Repartimiento_ and the _Mita_. The\r\nRepartimiento was the distribution, among the natives, of articles of\r\nEuropean production. These distributions were under the superintendence\r\nof the provincial authorities, the corregidores, and the sub-delegados.\r\nThe law was doubtless intended, in its origin, for the advantage and\r\nconvenience of the native Indians, by supplying them with necessaries at\r\na reasonable price. But, subsequently, the Repartimiento became a source\r\nof oppression and fraud, in the hands of the provincial authorities. All\r\nthe corregidores and sub-delegados became traders. They purchased\r\nconsignments of manufactured goods from Europe, at a cheap rate, and\r\nsold them to the Indians at exorbitant prices. To add to the grievance,\r\nthe articles thus forced upon the natives were, in many instances, not\r\nnecessaries, but objects of luxury utterly useless to them. Even more\r\noppressive and cruel than the Repartimiento, was the Mita, which\r\nconsisted of the forced labor of the Indians in the mines and\r\nplantations. Every Spaniard who wished to work a mine, obtained from the\r\ncorregidor a certain number of Indians, to each of whom he gave daily\r\nfour reals as wages, with the agreement of paying to the government a\r\nyearly tax of eight dollars. The condition of the Indians who were\r\ndistributed to the plantation owners was even worse than that of the\r\nmine laborers; they received only two reals per day, and were required\r\nto work in the fields from three in the morning until after sunset. The\r\nIndians employed in this compulsory labor, whether in the mines or the\r\nplantations, were called _Mitas_. But there was another sort of forced\r\nlabor, for which no wages were paid. It was indeed less toilsome than\r\nworking in the mines and plantations, yet the Indians employed in it\r\nwere frequently subject to much ill-treatment. I allude to domestic\r\nservice in the houses of the corregidores, sub-delegados, and priests.\r\nThe Indians thus employed were called _Pongos_, and they were required\r\nto continue in their places for the space of a year, after which they\r\nwere discharged. A corregidor frequently had half a dozen of these\r\npongos, whom he provided with miserable food and wretched clothing.[102]\r\n\r\nIn the mines and plantations countless numbers of Indians were annually\r\nswept away by the excessive labor consequent on the mita. Some writers\r\nestimate at nine millions the number of Indians sacrificed in the mines\r\nin the course of three centuries. This estimate is certainly too high;\r\nbut three millions more may be added for the number of victims of the\r\nmita in the plantations.\r\n\r\nThat the government in Spain should have tolerated this barbarous\r\nsystem, so obviously calculated to bring ruin on the nation, may\r\nnaturally be matter of surprise. But a glance at the Indian laws (_Leyes\r\nde Indias_) suffices to show the distinction between the intentions of\r\nthe Spanish government and the corrupt legislation of the country. The\r\nlaws are, with some few exceptions, conceived in a mild spirit, and show\r\nthat their framers had in view the well-being of the colonies. The\r\nexecution of these laws was consigned to the superintendence of what was\r\ntermed the Indian council (_Consejo de Indias_). This council consisted\r\nof a certain number of men who resided in Spain, and who either were\r\nonly in part acquainted with the real state of things in South America,\r\nor were bribed by Indian gold to wink at the abuses committed there.\r\nFrom this council were chosen the viceroys and high authorities of the\r\ncolonies, who, whilst in the exercise of their official functions,\r\namassed enormous wealth by unjust exactions from the Indians. One of the\r\nlatest viceroys of Peru was a man who arrived in Lima in a state of\r\nutter poverty, and who, in the short space of three years, amassed the\r\nimmense sum of five millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nCould it be matter of surprise if at length the Indians rose against\r\ntheir oppressors, and made an effort to shake off the heavy yoke of\r\ntheir tyrants? For two hundred years they had borne it silently, without\r\na single attempt to emancipate themselves. Juan Santos Atahuallpa was\r\nthe first who stirred up revolt against the Spaniards. The insurrection\r\nwhich he had headed, though deemed too insignificant to fix the\r\nattention of the short-sighted government of Lima, nevertheless,\r\nconvinced the Indians that they were strong enough to make a stand\r\nagainst their oppressors. Several partial risings in Southern Peru were\r\nspeedily put down; a leader was wanted to organize the disconnected\r\nplans and movements of the insurgents. This want was at length supplied\r\nin the person of the ill-fated Tupac Amaru, cacique of Tungasuca, a\r\ndescendant of the last Inca.\r\n\r\nThe event which caused Tupac Amaru to attempt a movement against the\r\nSpaniards occurred in 1780. In that year, the corregidor of Tinta, Don\r\nAntonio Ariaga, made repartimientos to the amount of 340,000 dollars,\r\nand with the most cruel rigor enforced payment of the useless articles\r\ndistributed. The cacique of Tungasuca assembled the irritated Indians,\r\nwho seized the corregidor and hanged him. This was the signal for a\r\ngeneral rising in all the neighboring districts. The forces of Tupac\r\nAmaru augmented daily. He was invested with the title of Inca, and\r\ntreated with the honors due to sovereignty. For several months an active\r\nwar was maintained in the Puna, where several towns and villages were\r\ntaken by the insurgents. Tupac Amaru had made himself master of the\r\nvillage of Chucuito, and was preparing to advance upon Cuzco, when,\r\nabout the end of April, 1781, he, and all his family, were made\r\nprisoners by the Spaniards. He was tried and condemned to death,\r\ntogether with his wife, two sons, his brother-in-law, and several other\r\nindividuals of note among the Indians.\r\n\r\nBut the execution of Tupac Amaru, which was marked by circumstances of\r\nmonstrous barbarity, far from stemming the tide of revolution, served\r\nonly to stimulate the vengeance of the insurgents. They once more\r\nmustered their warlike bands, under the command of Casimiro Tupac Amaru,\r\nthe brother of the late cacique, his son Andres, and an intrepid Indian\r\nchief, named Nicacatari. The latter, assisted by Andres, burned several\r\nvillages of Upper Peru, and murdered all the whites. They next advanced\r\nupon the strongly fortified town of Sorrata, whither the Spaniards of\r\nthe surrounding districts had fled for protection. The town was taken by\r\nthe insurgents, and the inhabitants, 22,000 in number, inhumanly put to\r\ndeath, with the exception of eighty-seven priests and monks. The Indians\r\nthen advanced westwards, defeating several Spanish corps, and spreading\r\nterror and dismay through the country. But, that which neither the arms\r\nnor the executions of the Spaniards could accomplish, was effected by\r\ntheir gold. A treacherous Indian, bribed by the promise of a large\r\nreward, conducted a division of Spanish soldiers to the spot where the\r\nchiefs were accustomed to meet, unattended by any guard, to hold their\r\ncouncil. They were surprised, captured, and condemned to death. Once\r\nmore deprived of leaders, the Indians disbanded and withdrew, some to\r\ntheir homes, and others into the forests. Numberless victims paid the\r\ndebt of retribution to the Spanish government, which now adopted every\r\nmeasure that could tend to annihilate the nationality of the native\r\nIndians. Their dances, their music, their dress--all that could revive\r\nthe remembrance of their progenitors, was condemned to rigorous\r\nprohibition; they were even forbidden the use of their mother tongue,\r\nthe Quichua language. The only beneficial result of these wars, in which\r\nupwards of a hundred thousand lives were sacrificed, was the abolition\r\nof the Repartimientos, which had been the cause of the insurrections.\r\n\r\nPeace was now, at least to appearance, restored; and if, occasionally,\r\nsymptoms of disturbance arose, they were immediately repressed. This\r\nstate of things continued until the Creoles themselves gave the signal\r\nof revolt, and the War of Independence broke out in all the Spanish\r\ncolonies of South America. In this enterprise the Indians readily took\r\npart. But it is a great mistake to suppose that the Indian natives made\r\ncommon cause with the Creoles against the Spaniards for the purpose of\r\nbringing about the present form of government. They wished to emancipate\r\nthemselves in order to establish their own dynasty and a government\r\nmodelled after that of their forefathers. They wanted not a republic,\r\nbut a monarchy, and a sovereign chosen from the sacred race of the\r\nIncas. Having no clear comprehension of the real object of the War of\r\nIndependence, the Indians, when they saw whites fighting against whites,\r\ndirected their hostility against all _Pucacuncas_ (pale faces) without\r\ndistinction, killing loyalists or patriots, just as they happened to\r\nfall in their way. This hatred was so bitterly manifested, that in some\r\nprovinces all the whites and mestizos were obliged to fly, even though\r\nthey were the most decided enemies of the Spanish loyalists. In Jauja\r\nthe Indians vowed not to leave even a white dog or a white fowl alive,\r\nand they even scraped the whitewash from the walls of the houses.\r\n\r\nThe provisional government ordered levies of troops to be made in the\r\nprovinces which had fallen into the hands of the patriots; and then, for\r\nthe first time, Indians were enrolled in the army as regular troops. But\r\nit was only in a very few districts that they voluntarily took part in\r\nthe conflict for independence: they performed the forced service of\r\nconscripts, and whenever an opportunity enabled them to retire from it,\r\nthey did so. The Spanish dominion being overthrown, the war terminated,\r\nand a republican constitution was established. The Indians then clearly\r\nperceived that they had been made the tools of the leaders of the\r\nrevolution. Upon the whole, their condition was but little improved; for\r\nif they were relieved from some oppressive laws, other hardships weighed\r\nheavily on them, and they found that they still were slaves in the land\r\nof their fathers. The creoles, like the Spaniards, will draw the string\r\nof despotism till it snaps. Then will arise another Indian insurrection\r\nlike that headed by Tupac Amaru, but with a more successful result.\r\nAfter a fearful struggle, they may reconquer their fatherland, and\r\nre-establish their ancient constitution; and can it be matter of\r\nsurprise if they wreak cruel vengeance on the enemies of their race?\r\n\r\nSince the War of Independence, the Indians have made immense progress.\r\nDuring the civil war, which was kept up uninterruptedly for the space of\r\ntwenty years, they were taught military manoeuvres and the use of\r\nfire-arms. After every lost battle the retreating Indians carried with\r\nthem in their flight their muskets, which they still keep carefully\r\nconcealed. They are also acquainted with the manufacture of gunpowder,\r\nof which in all their festivals they use great quantities for squibs and\r\nrockets. The materials for the preparation of gunpowder are found in\r\nabundance in the valleys of the Sierra.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1841, when I was passing through a miserable village on the\r\nconfines of one of the Montañas of Central Peru, I took up my abode for\r\nsome days in the hut of an Indian, and whilst there I accidentally saw\r\neighteen muskets which were deposited in a place of concealment. I,\r\nquite unsuspectingly, inquired of the Indian, why he thought it\r\nrequisite to keep so many weapons of defence? He replied, with a\r\nsinister frown, that the time would come when he should find them\r\nuseful. I could easily perceive that my accidental discovery was by no\r\nmeans agreeable to him; and from the very marked change which I observed\r\nin his manner. I deemed it prudent to withdraw from the village and its\r\nvicinity. Whilst my horse was being saddled, I noticed my host and some\r\nof his confidential friends engaged in very earnest conversation, and I\r\ncould easily perceive that I was the subject of it. On my departure the\r\nIndian asked me, with apparent friendliness of manner, which way I was\r\ngoing? When I was beyond the sphere of his observation, I deemed it\r\nprudent to proceed quite in an opposite direction from the route which I\r\ntold him I intended to take.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Peruvian Indian is essentially gloomy. It was not\r\nalways so, if we may give credit to the animated pictures drawn by early\r\ntravellers in Peru; but three hundred years of oppression and suffering\r\nhave impressed their melancholy stamp on the feelings and manners of the\r\npeople. This gloominess is strikingly manifested in their songs, their\r\ndances, their dress, and their whole domestic economy. The favorite\r\nmusical instruments of the Indians are those called the _Pututo_ and the\r\n_Jaina_. The former is a large conch, on which they perform mournful\r\nmusic, as the accompaniment of their funeral dances. In early times this\r\nconch was employed in the solemnities of royal interments; now its use\r\nis exclusively reserved for the anniversaries held in commemoration of\r\ncertain events connected with the fallen Inca dynasty. The _Jaina_\r\nappears to be of more modern origin; it is a rude kind of clarionet,\r\nmade from a reed. Its tone is indescribably melancholy, and it produces\r\nan extraordinary impression on the natives. If a group of Indians are\r\nrioting and drinking, or engaged in furious conflict with each other,\r\nand the sound of the _Jaina_ is suddenly heard, the tumult ceases, as if\r\nby a stroke of magic. A dead stillness prevails, and all listen devoutly\r\nto the magic tones of the simple reed; tones which frequently draw tears\r\nfrom the eyes of the apathetic Indian.\r\n\r\nTheir garments are all of dark and sombre hues. Dark blue is a favorite\r\ncolor, and appears to be generally adopted for mourning; for whenever\r\nthe Indians follow a corpse to the grave, they always wear dark blue\r\nponchos. The dress of the men usually consists of short trowsers, of\r\ncoarse brown cloth, fastened round the waist by a girdle, and a woollen\r\nor cotton shirt. They seldom wear a jacket, the ponchos of Alpaca wool\r\nbeing always the outer garment. On their feet they wear sandals of\r\nuntanned leather, which merely cover the toes, and are fastened round\r\nthe ancle.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the women consists of a loose under garment, without\r\nsleeves, and made of coarse blue woollen cloth. It is confined round the\r\nwaist by a broad girdle, called the _huccau_. Over the arms are drawn\r\nblack sleeves, reaching from the wrist to about the middle of the upper\r\narm. A sort of robe or tunic, called the _anacu_, descends from the\r\nshoulders to the knees. It is fastened, not in front, but on one side.\r\nThis garment is made of a thin sort of woollen stuff. It is always\r\nblack, being worn in token of mourning for the Incas. On the occasion of\r\ncertain festivals, the Indian women wear a particolored dress, called a\r\n_faldillin_. This garment frequently exhibits the most glaring contrasts\r\nof color, one half being bright red, and the other yellow, in addition\r\nto which it is sometimes adorned with flowers of brilliant hues, and\r\ntasteless, gold embroidery. A _mantilla_, consisting of a narrow piece\r\nof woollen cloth, passed over the shoulders, and fastened under the\r\nchin, either with a long silver pin, or a cactus-thorn, completes the\r\ncostume. In this mantilla, or in a poncho, mothers are accustomed to\r\nwrap their infants, and fastening them to their backs, they carry them\r\nabout in this manner for a whole day, whilst engaged in their work.\r\n\r\nIn their domestic relations, the Indians are unsocial and gloomy.\r\nHusband, wife, and children live together with but little appearance of\r\naffection. The children seem to approach their parents timidly, and\r\nwhole days sometimes elapse without the interchange of a word of\r\nkindness between them. When the Indian is not engaged in out-door work,\r\nhe sits gloomily in his hut, chewing coca, and brooding silently over\r\nhis own thoughts. To his friend he is more communicative than to his\r\nwife. With the former, he will often discourse, apparently on some\r\nsecret topic, for the space of half a night; nevertheless, he cannot be\r\naccused of treating his wife with any degree of cruelty, or of\r\nregarding her merely in the light of his slave, as is customary among\r\nmany uncivilized races of people.\r\n\r\nBesides the official authorities, to which the Government exacts\r\nobedience, the Peruvian Indian acknowledges other authorities, whose\r\nfunctions and power are similar to those which existed under the Inca\r\ndynasty. In like manner, though they have embraced the Christian faith,\r\nyet they obstinately adhere to certain religious ceremonies, which have\r\nbeen transmitted to them by their idolatrous progenitors. Thus their\r\nreligion is a singular combination of Christian principles and\r\nheathenish forms. Hitherto the most patient and intelligent of their\r\nreligious instructors have failed to outroot this attachment to old\r\nforms. The Christian religion has been spread among the Indians by\r\nforce; and for centuries past, they have regarded the priests only in\r\nthe light of tyrants, who make religion a cloak for the most scandalous\r\npecuniary extortions, and whose conduct is in direct opposition to the\r\ndoctrines they profess. If they render to them unconditional obedience,\r\naccompanied by a sort of timid reverence, it is to be attributed less to\r\nthe operation of the Christian principle, than to a lingering attachment\r\nto the theocratic government of the Incas, which has impressed the\r\nPeruvians with a sacred awe of religion.\r\n\r\nThe superstition with which the Indians are so deeply imbued is adverse\r\nto the inculcation of pure religious faith; it is the more difficult to\r\nbe eradicated, inasmuch as it has its origin in early tradition, and has\r\nin later times been singularly blended with the Catholic form of\r\nworship. Of this superstition I may here adduce some examples. As soon\r\nas a dying person draws his last breath, the relatives, or persons in\r\nattendance, put coca leaves into the mouth of the corpse, and light a\r\nwax candle. They then collect together the household goods and clothes\r\nof the deceased and wash them in the nearest river. They put on the dead\r\nclothes, which are made after the pattern of a monk's habit, and they\r\nhang round the neck of the corpse a little bag, containing seeds of\r\ncoca, maize, barley, quinua, &c., for his plantations in the next world.\r\nIn the evening ashes are strewed on the floor of the room, and the door\r\nis securely fastened. Next morning the ashes are carefully examined to\r\nascertain whether they show any impression of footsteps; and imagination\r\nreadily traces marks, which are alleged to have been produced by the\r\nfeet of birds, dogs, cats, oxen, or llamas. The destiny of the dead\r\nperson is construed by the foot-marks which are supposed to be\r\ndiscernible. The worst marks are those of hens' claws, which are\r\nbelieved to denote that the soul of the deceased is doomed to\r\nirrevocable perdition. The marks of the hoofs of llamas are considered\r\nfavorable, and are believed to indicate that the soul, after a short\r\npurgatory, will be transferred to the joys of paradise. The funeral is\r\nconducted according to Christian forms, and under the superintendence of\r\na priest. But as soon as the priest takes his departure food is put into\r\nthe grave along with the dead body, which is interred without a coffin.\r\nI have sometimes seen one of the nearest relatives leap into the grave\r\nand strike the body with his foot, but the meaning of this strange\r\nproceeding I never could clearly understand. Some curious ceremonies are\r\nobserved on All Souls' Day. In every house in which a member of the\r\nfamily has died in the course of the year, a table is laid out with\r\nbrandy, coca, tobacco, together with some of the favorite dishes of the\r\ndeceased person, and the chamber is kept closed the whole day. The\r\nfamily firmly believe that the spirit of their departed relative on that\r\nday revisits his earthly abode, and partakes of the repast that is\r\nspread out on the table. A widow usually wears mourning for the space of\r\ntwelve months. In some provinces, on the anniversary of her husband's\r\ndeath, the widow puts on a bridal dress, and over it her ordinary\r\ngarments. All her relatives visit her in her dwelling, where, to the\r\naccompaniment of doleful music, she takes the lead in a funeral dance.\r\nAs the hour approaches at which the husband died in the previous year,\r\nthe dancing and the music become more and more mournful; but whenever\r\nthe hour is past one of the female friends approaches the widow and\r\nremoves her black mantilla. The other females then strip off the rest of\r\nher mourning garments, and adorn her head with flowers. At length she\r\nappears in a complete bridal dress. The musicians strike up a lively\r\nstrain, to which the whole party dance, and the evening is passed in\r\ndrinking and merry-making.\r\n\r\nAmong the Peruvian Indians there are marked varieties of form and\r\ncomplexion. These differences are most distinctly observable between\r\nthe inhabitants of the coast and those of the mountain and forest\r\nregions. In general, the Peruvian Indian is of middle height, rather\r\nslender, and not very robust. The coast Indians are more plump than the\r\ninhabitants of other districts, because they lead a less laborious life,\r\nand are less exposed to privations. It is scarcely possible to trace any\r\nparticular national physiognomy among the Indians. In each province a\r\ndistinct character is observable in the features of the inhabitants. The\r\nvarieties of feature are less distinctly marked than the differences of\r\ncomplexion. The peculiar tints of the skin are decidedly defined, and\r\nindicate respectively the inhabitants of the three principal regions.\r\nThe colder the climate, the fairer is the skin. For example, the color\r\nof the Puna Indian is a dark red-brown; that of the native of the Sierra\r\nis considerably lighter; it is a rusty red, but still darker than that\r\nof the coast Indians; and the natives of the forests are yellow, nearly\r\napproaching to maize color. These differences are singularly striking,\r\nwhen one has an opportunity of seeing the inhabitants of the different\r\nregions in juxtaposition. It is curious that the Cholos of the Puna,\r\nwhen they settle in the forests, become only a very little clearer; and\r\nthat, on the other hand, the yellow Indians of the Montaña, after being\r\nseveral years in the Puna, still retain their characteristic tint. The\r\nwomen are, on the whole, extremely ugly, with round, inexpressive faces.\r\nTheir hands and feet are very small.\r\n\r\nThe Indians are, on the average, remarkable for longevity, though they\r\nfrequently shorten their lives by the intemperate use of strong drinks.\r\nInstances are not rare of Indians living to be 120 or 130 years of age,\r\nand retaining full possession of their bodily and mental powers.\r\nStevenson mentions that on examining the church registers of Barranca,\r\nhe found that within an interval of seven years, eleven Indians had been\r\ninterred, whose united ages amounted to 1207, being an average of 109\r\nyears to each. In the year 1839 there was living in the valley of Jauja\r\nan Indian who, according to the baptismal register shown to me by the\r\npriest, was born in the year 1697. He himself declared that he had not\r\nfor the space of ninety years tasted a drop of water, having drunk\r\nnothing but chicha. Since he was eleven years of age, he alleged that\r\nhe had masticated coca, at least three times every day, and that he had\r\neaten animal food only on Sundays; on all the other days of the week he\r\nhad lived on maize, quinua, and barley. The Indians retain their teeth\r\nand hair in extreme old age; and it is remarkable that their hair never\r\nbecomes white, and very seldom even grey. Those individuals whose\r\nadvanced ages have been mentioned above, had all fine black hair.\r\n\r\nSince the Spanish conquest, the population of Peru has diminished in an\r\nalmost incredible degree. When we read the accounts given by the old\r\nhistoriographers of the vast armies which the Incas had at their\r\ncommand; when we behold the ruins of the gigantic buildings, and of the\r\nnumerous towns and villages scattered over Peru, it is difficult to\r\nconceive how the land could have been so depopulated in the lapse of\r\nthree centuries. At the time of the conquest it was easy, in a short\r\nspace of time, to raise an army of 300,000 men, and, moreover, to form\r\nan important reserved force; whilst now, the Government, even with the\r\nutmost efforts, can scarcely assemble 10,000 or 12,000 men. According to\r\nthe census drawn up in 1836, Peru did not contain more than 1,400,000\r\nmen, being not quite so many as were contained at an earlier period in\r\nthe department of Cuzco alone. Unfortunately there is no possibility of\r\nobtaining anything approaching to accurate estimates of the population\r\nof early periods; and even if such documents existed, it would be\r\ndifficult to deduce from them a comparison between Peru as it now is,\r\nand Peru at the period when Bolivia, a part of Buenos Ayres, and\r\nColumbia, belonged to the mighty empire. I will here quote only one\r\nexample of the immense diminution of the population. Father Melendez\r\nmentions that shortly after the conquest, the parish of Ancallama, in\r\nthe province of Chancay, contained 30,000 Indians fit for service (that\r\nis to say, between the ages of eighteen and fifty); now, the same parish\r\ncontains at most 140 individuals, of whom one-third are Mestizos. The\r\nwhole coast of Peru, now almost totally depopulated, was once so thickly\r\ninhabited, that to subdue King Chimu, in North Peru alone, an army of\r\n80,000 men was requisite. The causes of the diminished Indian population\r\nof Peru have been so frequently and fully detailed by previous writers,\r\nthat I need not here do more than briefly advert to them. They are found\r\nin the extensive and reckless massacres committed by the Spaniards\r\nduring the struggle of the conquest; in the suicides and voluntary\r\ndeaths resorted to by the natives to escape from the power of their\r\noppressors; in the mita, the small-pox, the scarlet fever, and the\r\nintroduction of brandy. The mita alone, especially the labor in the\r\nmines, has swept away four times as many Indians as all the other causes\r\ncombined. Since the abolition of the mita, the Indian population has\r\nbeen on the increase, though there has not yet been time for any marked\r\nresult to become manifest; the more especially, considering the numbers\r\nof lives sacrificed during the frequent civil wars. Nevertheless, it is\r\neasy to foresee that a decided augmentation of the Indian inhabitants of\r\nthe western parts of South America will, ere long, be apparent.\r\n\r\nAmong the aboriginal inhabitants of Peru a variety of languages are in\r\nuse. In the southern parts of the country, particularly about Cuzco, the\r\n_Quichua_ is spoken. It was the dialect of the court, and that which was\r\nmost generally diffused, and the Spaniards therefore called it _la\r\nlengua general_. In the highlands of Central Peru, the Chinchaysuyo\r\nlanguage prevailed. The Indians of the coast, who belonged to the race\r\nof the Chunchos, spoke the _Yunga_. The _Kauqui_ was the language of\r\nthat part of Central Peru which corresponds with the present province of\r\nYauyos. The inhabitants of the north-eastern parts of Peru, as far as\r\nthe Huallaga, spoke the _Lama_ language,[103] and the natives of the\r\nhighland regions of Quito spoke the _Quiteña_.[104] These different\r\nlanguages, which, with the exception of the Lama, proceed all from one\r\nsource, differ so considerably, that the inhabitants of the several\r\ndistricts were reciprocally incapable of understanding each other, and\r\nthe Incas found it necessary to introduce the Quichua among all the\r\nnations they subdued. The other dialects were thereby much corrupted,\r\nand at the time of the Spanish invasion, they were seldom correctly\r\nspoken. This corruption was naturally increased more and more after the\r\narrival of the Spaniards, by the introduction of a new language. Only\r\nfor a few of the new articles brought by the Spaniards to Peru did the\r\nIndians form new names, taking the roots of the words from their own\r\nlanguage: for most things they adopted the Spanish names. By this means,\r\nbut still more by the future intercourse of the people with the\r\ninvaders, the purity of the natural language rapidly disappeared in\r\nproportion to the influence which the Spaniards obtained by their\r\nincrease in numbers and moral superiority. At present the Quichua is a\r\ncompound of all the dialects and the Spanish; it is spoken in the\r\ngreatest purity in the southern provinces, though even there it is much\r\nintermixed with Aymara words. In Central Peru the Chinchaysuyo prevails,\r\nand on the coast the Spanish and the Yunga. The present Indians and\r\npeople of mixed blood, who of necessity must speak the ever-changing\r\nQuichua, and also the Spanish, speak both in so corrupt a manner, that\r\nit is frequently almost impossible to understand them.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Incas had a secret language of their own, which was\r\nnot learned by subjects. This language is now almost totally lost, not\r\nmore than two dozen words of it being preserved. In early times, the\r\nQuichua language was much cultivated. It was used officially in public\r\nspeaking, and professors were sent by the Inca family into the provinces\r\nto teach it correctly. For poetry, the Quichua language was not very\r\nwell adapted, owing to the difficult conjugation of the verbs, and the\r\nawkward blending of pronouns with substantives. Nevertheless, the poetic\r\nart was zealously cultivated under the Incas. They paid certain poets\r\n(called the _Haravicus_), for writing festival dramas in verse, and also\r\nfor composing love-songs and heroic poems. Few of these heroic poems\r\nhave been preserved, a circumstance the more to be regretted, as many of\r\nthem would doubtless have been important historical documents; but for\r\nthat very reason, the Spaniards spared no pains to obliterate every\r\ntrace of them. Some of the love-songs have, however, been preserved. In\r\nQuichua poetry, the lines are short, and seldom thoroughly rhythmical.\r\nRhymes were only exceptional, and were never sought for. The poetry was,\r\ntherefore, merely a sort of broken prose.\r\n\r\nA specimen of one of the best of the Quichua love-songs is given by\r\n_Garcilaso de la Vega_, in his \"Commentaries and Poems.\" It is copied\r\nfrom papers left by a monk named Blas Valera; and some lines of it are\r\nhere subjoined. The subject is an old Peruvian tradition:--A maiden of\r\nroyal blood (_ñusta_) is appointed by the Creator of the world\r\n(_Pacchacamac_) in heaven, to pour water and snow on the earth out of\r\na pitcher; her brother breaks the pitcher, whereupon thunder and\r\nlightning arise.\r\n\r\n        Cumac ñusta      Beautiful Princess,\r\n        Turallayquim     Thy Pitcher\r\n        Puynuyquita      Thy brother hath broken\r\n        Paquicayan       Here in Pieces;\r\n        Hina mantara     For that blow\r\n        Cunuñunun        It thunders; and lightning\r\n        Yllapantac       Flashes all around.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, instances of versification which may properly be\r\ncalled poetry. Of this the _Yaravies_, or elegies, afford some fair\r\nexamples. These poems have for their subjects unfortunate love, or\r\nsorrow for the dead. They were recited or sung by one or more voices,\r\nwith an accompaniment of melancholy music, and made a great impression\r\non the hearers. A foreigner, who for the first time hears one of these\r\n_Yaravies_ sung, even though he may not understand the Quichua words, is\r\nnevertheless deeply moved by the melody. The strain is sad and sweet. No\r\nother music is at once so dismal and so tender. What the _donina_ is as\r\nan instrument, the _yaravie_ is in singing; both convey the expression\r\nof a deeply troubled heart. The _yaravie_ has been imitated by the\r\nSpaniards in their own language, and some of the imitations are very\r\nbeautiful; but they have not been able to reach the deep melancholy of\r\nthe Quichua elegy. The modern poetry of the Indians is inferior to the\r\nold; the words are a mixture of Quichua and Spanish, and are scarcely\r\nintelligible. The Spanish words have often Quichua terminations affixed\r\nto them; on the other hand, sometimes the Quichua words are inflected\r\nafter the Spanish manner, making altogether a barbarous compound.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Peruvians had no manuscript characters for single sounds;\r\nbut they had a method by which they composed words and incorporated\r\nideas. This method consisted in the dexterous intertwining of knots on\r\nstrings, so as to render them auxiliaries to the memory. The instrument\r\nconsisting of these strings and knots was called the QUIPU. It was\r\ncomposed of one thick head or top string, to which, at certain\r\ndistances, thinner ones were fastened. The top string was much thicker\r\nthan these pendent strings, and consisted of two doubly twisted threads,\r\nover which two single threads were wound. The branches, if I may apply\r\nthe term to these pendent strings, were fastened to the top ones by a\r\nsimple loop; the knots were made in the pendent strings, and were either\r\nsingle or manifold. The lengths of the strings used in making the quipu\r\nwere various. The transverse or top string often measures several yards,\r\nand sometimes only a foot long; the branches are seldom more than two\r\nfeet long, and in general they are much shorter.\r\n\r\nThe strings were often of different colors; each having its own\r\nparticular signification. The color for soldiers was red; for gold,\r\nyellow; for silver, white; for corn, green, &c. This writing by knots\r\nwas especially employed for numerical and statistical tables; each\r\nsingle knot representing ten; each double knot stood for one hundred;\r\neach triple knot for one thousand, &c.; two single knots standing\r\ntogether made twenty; and two double knots, two hundred.\r\n\r\nThis method of calculation is still practised by the shepherds of the\r\nPuna. They explained it to me, and I could, with very little trouble,\r\nconstrue their quipus. On the first branch or string they usually placed\r\nthe numbers of the bulls; on the second, that of the cows; the latter\r\nbeing classed into those which were milked, and those which were not\r\nmilked; on the next string were numbered the calves, according to their\r\nages and sizes. Then came the sheep, in several subdivisions. Next\r\nfollowed the number of foxes killed, the quantity of salt consumed,\r\nand, finally, the cattle that had been slaughtered. Other quipus showed\r\nthe produce of the herds in milk, cheese, wool, &c. Each list was\r\ndistinguished by a particular color, or by some peculiarity in the\r\ntwisting of the string.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the ancient Peruvians kept the accounts of their army. On\r\none string were numbered the soldiers armed with slings; on another, the\r\nspearmen; on a third, those who carried clubs, &c. In the same manner\r\nthe military reports were prepared. In every town some expert men were\r\nappointed to tie the knots of the quipu, and to explain them. These men\r\nwere called _quipucamayocuna_ (literally, officers of the knots).\r\nImperfect as was this method, yet in the flourishing period of the Inca\r\ngovernment the appointed officers had acquired great dexterity in\r\nunriddling the meaning of the knots. It, however, seldom happened that\r\nthey had to read a quipu without some verbal commentary. Something was\r\nalways required to be added if the quipu came from a distant province,\r\nto explain whether it related to the numbering of the population, to\r\ntributes, or to war, &c. Through long-continued practice, the officers\r\nwho had charge of the quipus became so perfect in their duties, that\r\nthey could with facility communicate the laws and ordinances, and all\r\nthe most important events of the kingdom, by their knots.\r\n\r\nAll attempts made in modern times to decipher Peruvian quipus have\r\nbeen unsatisfactory in their results. The principal obstacle to\r\ndeciphering those found in graves, consists in the want of the oral\r\ncommunication requisite for pointing out the subjects to which they\r\nrefer. Such communication was necessary, even in former times, to the\r\nmost learned quipucamayocuna. Most of the quipus here alluded to seem\r\nto be accounts of the population of particular towns or provinces,\r\ntax-lists, and information relating to the property of the deceased.\r\nSome Indians in the southern provinces of Peru are understood to\r\npossess a perfect knowledge of some of the ancient quipus, from\r\ninformation transmitted to them from their ancestors. But they keep\r\nthat knowledge profoundly secret, particularly from the whites. The\r\nancient Peruvians also used a certain kind of hieroglyphics, which\r\nthey engraved in stone, and preserved in their temples. Notices of\r\nthese hieroglyphics are given by some of the early writers. There\r\nappears to be a great similarity between these Peruvian hieroglyphics\r\nand those found in Mexico and Brazil.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned one of the largest and most wonderful works of\r\nPeruvian antiquity, namely, the great military road which passes through\r\nthe whole empire leading from Cuzco to Quitu, and which has many highly\r\nimportant lateral branches. The magnificent water-conduits, by which\r\nbarren sand wastes and sterile hills were converted into fruitful\r\nplantations, are monuments of equivalent greatness. Traces of these\r\nwater-conduits are to be seen throughout the whole of Peru, and even\r\nwhere the canals themselves no longer exist, the divisional boundaries\r\nof the fields they watered are still discernible. In many districts\r\nwhere the valleys of the Sierra run into the Puna--(I allude here only\r\nto the declivities above Tarmatambo, on the road towards Jauja)--there\r\nmay be seen many square fields of uniform size, each of which is\r\nsurrounded by a low stone wall; these fields are at present overgrown\r\nwith Puna grass, and are not fit for cultivation. They are what were\r\ncalled _Tapu_ lands, which were distributed to every subject of the Inca\r\nempire, so that each family enjoyed the produce arising from the\r\ncultivation of a certain portion of ground. These Tapu lands were\r\nwatered by skilfully constructed aqueducts, whereby they were rendered\r\nsuitable for agriculture. The Spaniards having destroyed the conduits,\r\nthe reservoirs dried up, and the soil became barren. Many of these\r\nconduits were subterraneous, and it is now no longer possible to find\r\nthem; in some parts they were constructed with pipes of gold, which the\r\nSpaniards eagerly seized as valuable booty.\r\n\r\nThere still exist vast remains of well-constructed colossal buildings,\r\nas palaces, fortresses, and temples. The walls of these edifices were\r\nbuilt of square stones, so finely cut, and joined so closely together,\r\nthat between any two there is not space sufficient to insert the edge of\r\nthe thinnest paper. In the royal palace of Cuzco, and in the Temple of\r\nthe Sun, a fusion of gold or silver was used for cement between the\r\nstones. This was, however, only employed as a luxury; for in other great\r\nedifices, for example, in the baths of Huamalies in the province of\r\nJauja, stones are kept together by their own weight and the precision of\r\nthe workmanship. These stones are of very considerable magnitude; some\r\nbeing from twelve to sixteen feet long, from eight to ten feet high, and\r\nequally broad. They are not all square; some are polygonal, and some\r\nspherical, but they were all joined one to another with the same\r\nexactness: of this a remarkable example is presented in the highly\r\ninteresting ruins of the palace of Limatambo. A question which naturally\r\nsuggests itself is,--how did the ancient Peruvians, without iron tools,\r\nhew these vast stones, and afterwards work the different fragments so\r\nskilfully? The first point is to me quite inexplicable; the second may\r\npossibly be accounted for by friction; the softest of two stones which\r\nwas to be brought into a particular shape being rubbed by a harder, and\r\nafterwards polished by pyritous plants. The removal of the block from\r\nthe quarry where it was excavated to the place of its destination, and\r\nthe raising of fragments of stone to considerable heights, could only\r\nhave been effected by the co-operation of thousands of men, for no kind\r\nof elevating machinery or lever was then known.\r\n\r\nThe fortresses give a high idea of the progress made by the ancient\r\nPeruvians in architectural art. These structures were surrounded by\r\nramparts and trenches. The larger ones were protected by the solidity of\r\nthe walls, and the smaller ones by difficulty of access. The approaches\r\nto them were chiefly subterraneous; and thereby, they were enabled to\r\nmaintain secret communication with the palaces and temples in their\r\nneighborhood. The subterraneous communications were carefully\r\nconstructed; they were of the height of a man, and in general from three\r\nto four feet broad. In some parts they contract suddenly in width, and\r\nthe walls on each side are built with sharp pointed stones, so that\r\nthere is no getting between them, except by a lateral movement. In other\r\nparts they occasionally become so low, that it is impossible to advance,\r\nexcept by creeping on all fours. Every circumstance had been made a\r\nsubject of strict calculation; it had been well considered how treasures\r\nmight be removed from the palaces and temples to the fortresses, and\r\nplaced securely beyond the reach of an enemy, for in the rear of every\r\nnarrow pass there were ample spaces for soldiers, who might dispute the\r\nadvance of a whole army. Besides the remains of the fortress of Cuzco,\r\nwhich are gradually disappearing every year, the most important are\r\nthose of Calcahilares and Huillcahuaman. Less interesting, though still\r\nvery curious, are the ruins of Chimu-canchu in Manische, near Truxillo,\r\nwhich are not of stone but of brick. The architecture of the small\r\nfortress of _Huichay_, two leagues from Tarma, which defended the\r\nentrance to that valley, is very remarkable. The front is built of small\r\nbut firmly united stones, and covers a large cavity, in which there are\r\nnumerous divisions, intended for the preservation of warlike stores, and\r\nfor quartering soldiers. On the steep declivity of the hill there had\r\nbeen a deep trench, between which there was a wall fourteen feet higher,\r\nflanked by three bastions. Around this fortress nitre is found in great\r\nabundance. It is now collected by the Huancas (the inhabitants of the\r\nvalley of Jauja), for making gunpowder. The diggings for nitre have\r\nalmost obliterated the entrance to the cavity, and the fortress is\r\nalready so much injured that possibly in another century scarcely a\r\ntrace of the edifice will remain. Notwithstanding a search of several\r\ndays, I did not succeed in discovering the mouth of the cavity, though\r\nan old Indian, who, years ago, had often visited it, pointed out to me\r\nwhat he supposed to be its precise situation. The walls of\r\nperpendicular rock in the neighborhood of Huichay are often 60 to 80\r\nfeet high, and the clefts or fissures in them are filled up with small\r\nstones. It would be incomprehensible how the Indians ascended to\r\nperform this labor, were it not perceived that they have hollowed\r\npassages in the mountain. It would appear they must have had\r\ndwellings, or stores for provisions, on the higher part of the hill,\r\nfor small windows are often perceptible in walls of masonry.\r\n\r\nThe old Indian villages of the Sierra are for the most part situated on\r\nheights, or sharp ridges, which are now completely barren, as they no\r\nlonger receive the artificial watering with which they were formerly\r\nsupplied. All lie open to the east, so that the inhabitants could behold\r\ntheir Deity the moment he appeared on the horizon. All large towns had a\r\nsquare in their centre, where the religious dances were performed. From\r\nthe square a certain number of regular roads or streets always ran in\r\nthe direction of the four quarters of the firmament. There are great\r\nvarieties in the construction of the houses. Small insignificant huts\r\noften stand close to a palace having twenty or twenty-five windows in\r\none front. Private dwellings in the mountainous parts are built of\r\nunhewn stone, cemented with a very strong calcareous mortar. On the\r\ncoast the walls are of brick. In the departments of Junin and Ayacucho,\r\nI met with the ruins of great villages, consisting of dwellings of a\r\npeculiar construction, in the form of a tower. Each house is\r\nquadrangular, with a diameter of about six feet, and seventeen or\r\neighteen feet high. The walls are from one to one and a half feet thick.\r\nThe doors, which open to the east or south, are only a foot and a half\r\nhigh, and two feet wide. After creeping in (which is a work of some\r\ndifficulty) the explorer finds himself in an apartment about five and a\r\nhalf feet in height, and of equal breadth, without any windows. In the\r\nwalls there are closets or cupboards, which served to contain domestic\r\nutensils, food, &c. Earthen pots with maize, coca, and other things, are\r\nstill often found in these closets. The ceiling of the room is\r\noverlaid with flat plates of stone, and in the centre an aperture, two\r\nfeet wide, is left, forming a communication with the second floor,\r\nwhich is precisely like the first, but has two small windows. The roof\r\nof this apartment has also an aperture, affording access to the third\r\nfloor, the ceiling of which forms the roof of the house, and consists\r\nof rather thick plates of stone. The upper room is usually less lofty\r\nthan the two rooms below it, and seems to have been used as a\r\nprovision store-room. I found in one of these upper rooms the mummy of\r\na child very well embalmed. The family appear to have lived chiefly on\r\nthe ground-floors. The place for cooking is often plainly perceptible.\r\nThe second floor was probably the sleeping apartment. In the course of\r\nmy travels, when overtaken by storms, I often retreated for shelter\r\ninto one of these ruined dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Peruvians frequently buried their dead in their own houses,\r\nand then removed from them. This custom appears to have been very\r\ngeneral about the time of the Spanish conquest, when a great number of\r\nIndians committed suicide in despair. Household utensils were placed in\r\nthe graves, when the dead were buried in the houses, as well as when\r\nthey were interred in other places. In many houses in which I made\r\ndiggings I regularly found the following arrangement. Under a stratum of\r\nearth two feet deep lay the body, in a state of good preservation, and\r\ngenerally, but not always, in a sitting posture. On clearing away\r\nanother stratum of earth equally deep there is found a variety of\r\nhousehold vessels for cooking, together with water-pots of clay, gourds,\r\nhunting and fishing implements, &c. There is frequently a third layer of\r\nearth, beneath which the gold and silver vessels and the household\r\ndeities are deposited. The idols are of clay, stone, and copper, or of\r\nthe precious metals. Those of clay are hollow, flat, compressed, and in\r\nmost instances the faces are painted. Those of stone are of granite,\r\nporphyry, or sand-stone. These stone images are solid, and often several\r\nfeet high. The golden idols are always hollow; but they exhibit no\r\ndistinct trace of the soldering. They are of various sizes; some of them\r\nweigh three quarters of a pound. Those of silver are always solid. All\r\nthese images of deities have the same physiognomy, and\r\ndisproportionately large head. In most instances the head is covered by\r\na peculiar kind of cap.\r\n\r\nThe vessels used for holding water or other liquids are very various in\r\ncolor and form. Most of them exhibit ludicrous caricatures of human\r\nfigures; others are unrecognisable representations of animals or fancy\r\nfigures. These vessels have in general two apertures, one by which they\r\nwere filled, and the other by which the liquid was poured out. On\r\nfilling them a feeble flute-like sound is heard. It is occasioned by the\r\nair escaping through the other aperture. Most of these vessels are made\r\nof red or black clay, well glazed. Those for holding chicha were very\r\ncapacious. Some of them, which have been found hermetically closed, have\r\ncontained chicha upwards of three hundred years old, and remarkable for\r\na very smoky flavor. On the vessels made of gourds fanciful figures are\r\ngenerally carved. Gold drinking cups have been found, adorned with well\r\nexecuted embossed ornaments, and like the images, showing no trace of\r\nsoldering. Among the warlike weapons, the stone battle-axes are very\r\nremarkable; they have at both ends a tube, in which the handle was fixed\r\nby ligatures. Articles for personal adornment, such as nose and lip\r\nrings, neck chains, pins, bracelets, and ancle bands, are usually of\r\ngold, and set with small colored shells. The sceptres of the Incas are\r\nof gold, and exquisitely wrought; those of the Curacas of silver; and\r\nthose of the Caciques of copper, sometimes gilt.\r\n\r\nIdols and utensils made of wood are very rarely found. It would appear\r\nthat the ancient Peruvians found more difficulty in the working of wood\r\nthan that of metal and stone. The Peruvians give to all objects dug up\r\nfrom the old graves, the name of _Huaqueros_, from Huaca, the word for\r\ngrave in the Quichua language.\r\n\r\nThe huacas or graves vary in form or magnitude. When destined for single\r\nindividuals they were made small; but when for families, they were of\r\nconsiderable extent. On the sandy soil of the coast, no elevation marks\r\nthe spot where the bodies are interred; but further inland (though still\r\nin the coast region), the graves are for the most part elevated and\r\narched, and are built of bricks. In the Sierra the tombs are of stone,\r\nquadrangular, oval, or of an obelisk form.\r\n\r\nIn the huacas, the bodies are found in a sitting position, and supported\r\nby stones or reeds: the face turned towards the east. In front of the\r\nbody it was customary to place two rows of pots containing quinua,\r\nmaize, potatoes, dried llama flesh, and other kinds of provisions, and\r\nthese pots were all covered with small lids. On each side of the body\r\nwere ranged cooking utensils, and vessels containing water and chicha.\r\nThe body and all the objects deposited in the grave were covered with a\r\nlayer of sand, above which were spread various articles of clothing.\r\nOver these was placed another layer of sand, and then the tomb was built\r\nabove the whole.\r\n\r\nThe bodies are found wrapped in several coverings; and when first taken\r\nout of the graves, they have the appearance of unfinished statues; the\r\nposition of the head, knees, and feet being alone recognisable. A strong\r\nnet-work, composed of twisted straw or bast incloses a thick rush mat,\r\nin which the body is wrapped. These coverings being removed, there is\r\nfound a broad, woollen bandage, passing round the body, and fastening\r\nthe rushes or sticks which support it in a sitting position. Under this\r\nbandage is a red or party-colored covering which goes over the whole\r\nbody; and beneath this are one or two yellowish-white coverings,\r\nstrongly sewed up. On removing these coverings, there are found some\r\npots or drinking cups, a few ornaments, the _Huallqui_ with coca, and in\r\nmost instances a silver or gold idol suspended from the neck of the\r\nbody. The undermost wrapper consists of a cloth of rather fine texture.\r\nProbably it was originally white, but time has changed it to a\r\nreddish-yellow. This covering being unsewed, the naked corpse appears;\r\nthe head alone being encircled with two or three bandages, called\r\n_Huinchas_. The body is always in a sitting posture; the knees being\r\ndrawn up towards the face, and the arms crossed over the breast, in\r\nsuch a manner that the chin rests between the two clenched hands. The\r\nwrists are tied together, and the ligature with which they are\r\nfastened is passed round the neck. This, which was evidently done only\r\nto keep the hands fixed in the required position, has led some\r\ncommentators on Peruvian antiquities to suppose that the bodies found\r\nwith strings round the necks were those of hanged persons. In the\r\nmouth there is a thin piece of gold, silver or copper; most of the\r\nbodies are in a good state of preservation, though the features are\r\nnot discernible. The hair is always found perfectly free from decay;\r\nand that of the females is beautifully plaited.\r\n\r\nThe question has arisen, whether these bodies were embalmed, or whether\r\ntheir preservation is merely the result of the mummifying nature of the\r\nclimate. Both conjectures have found zealous supporters. Don Francisco\r\nBarrero, keeper of the Museum of Natural History in Lima, mentions, in\r\nthe _Memorial de Ciencias Naturales_,[105] that among the ancient\r\nPeruvians certain men were appointed as embalmers, and he describes the\r\nprocess they adopted as follows:--They first extracted the brain through\r\nthe nose, then took out the eyes, and stopped up the sockets with\r\ncotton. The bowels, lungs, and even the tongue, were removed, after\r\nwhich the body and skull were filled with a kind of powder, which\r\nimmediately after it is taken out of the mummies, diffuses a slight\r\nodor of turpentine; this odor, however, it soon loses on being\r\nexposed to the action of the air. The face, hands, and feet, were\r\nrubbed over with an oily substance, after which the body was incased\r\nin the envelopes above described. I am disposed to believe that this\r\nprocess never had any existence, save in the imagination of Barrera:\r\nit indeed resembles the manner in which the Egyptians prepared their\r\nmummies; but no such method was practised among the Indians. The\r\nmummies collected in the museum of Lima present not the slightest\r\ntrace of this powder, or indeed of any kind of preservative\r\nmaterial--a fact which is mentioned by the director of that\r\nestablishment, Don E. Mariano de Rivero, in his _Antiguedades\r\nPeruanas_.[106]\r\n\r\nOn those parts of the coast where it never rains, the combined heat of\r\nthe sun and the sand has dried up the bodies; in the mountain districts,\r\nthe pure atmosphere and the peculiarly drying nature of the wind have\r\nproduced the same effect. Similar appearances may be traced to different\r\ncircumstances. Of this fact the burial ground of Huacho, and the\r\nmummified animals seen on the level heights, furnish the most convincing\r\nproofs. In districts exposed to frequent rain, mummies are found in very\r\nbad preservation, most of them being mere skeletons. All are in sitting\r\npostures. In those parts of the Sierra where the soil is impregnated\r\nwith nitre, bodies, which must have lain in the ground for several\r\ncenturies, are found in a very fresh condition, notwithstanding the\r\nhumidity.\r\n\r\nGarcilaso de la Vega and the Padre Acosta state that the ancient\r\nPeruvians were acquainted with the art of embalming, but that they\r\nemployed it only for the bodies of their kings. In the Temple of the Sun\r\nat Cuzco, there were found excellently preserved mummies of the Incas,\r\neach seated on a throne. Several years after the Spanish conquest, these\r\nmummies were conveyed to Lima, and were buried in the court of the\r\nhospital of San Andres. It is deeply to be deplored that the fanaticism\r\nof the Spanish conquerors should have destroyed these interesting\r\nremains of the ancient sovereigns of Peru.\r\n\r\nThe facts adduced in the course of this volume, relative to the\r\nbarbarous colonization system of the Spaniards, must sufficiently prove\r\nhow adverse was Spanish dominion to the improvement of the natives, and\r\nto the prosperity of the country. For Peru, Nature's bounteously favored\r\nland, let us hope that there is reserved a future, happier than either\r\nthe past or the present!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Even to this day the custom of forced domestic service is\r\nkept up in some parts of the Sierra, where the priest is allowed the\r\nservices of a female cook, who is called a _Mita_, and a man servant,\r\nfor whom the name of _Pongo_ is reserved. These servants are kept for\r\nthe space of a week.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Adelung, in his \"Review of all Languages,\" considers the\r\nCalchaqui (still spoken in Tucuman) to be a dialect of the Quichua.
