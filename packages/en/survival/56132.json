They may also originate from the untiring\r\nefforts of the meanest rodents or the most minute crustaceous animals\r\nburrowing passages for aqueous action, the chief agent of the\r\ninstability of the surface soils of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe ceaseless mutability of the created elements has been thus\r\nmagnificently described:—\r\n\r\n            “For know, whatever was created needs\r\n            To be sustain’d and fed; of elements\r\n            The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\r\n            Earth and the sea feed air, the air those fires\r\n            Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;\r\n            Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg’d\r\n            Vapours not yet into her substance turn’d.\r\n            Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale\r\n            From her moist continent to higher orbs.\r\n            The Sun, that light imparts to all, receives\r\n            From all his alimental recompense\r\n            In humid exhalations, and at even\r\n            Sups with the ocean.”\r\n\r\nIt is the constant absence of peace and rest in the earth that produces\r\ninstability, however great, however small, for the disastrous landslips\r\nthat have occurred in Switzerland and other parts of Europe, in India,\r\nand recently at Quebec, and in all regions of the world were caused by\r\nthe same disintegrating operations as those which generate an earth-slip\r\nof comparative insignificance. In proceeding to a practical\r\nconsideration of earthslips and subsidences, it may be well to call\r\nattention to the complexity of the subject, the character and conditions\r\nof earth and the impairing elements being so very variable and numerous\r\nthat it is impossible to determine any rules even for a particular soil;\r\nand, moreover, it is necessary to separately consider slips in cuttings\r\nand those in embankments, as movement is somewhat differently created,\r\nand it does not necessarily follow because earth stands well in a\r\ncutting that it will do so in an embankment, or _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nIt may be said every kind of earth will slip or weather under certain\r\nconditions, even the hardest rock if superimposed upon an unstable\r\nstratum; therefore, some of the main questions to be considered are:—\r\n\r\n  I. THE PROBABILITY OF THE OCCURRENCE OF A SLIP.\r\n\r\n  II. THE EFFECT OF A SLIP.\r\n\r\n  III. SHOULD EVERY PRECAUTION BE TAKEN TO PREVENT A SLIP WHEN A\r\n  CUTTING IS BEING EXCAVATED OR AN EMBANKMENT BEING DEPOSITED; OR IS\r\n  IT BETTER TO REPAIR A SLIP AS IT HAPPENS?\r\n\r\nIt is obvious in railway cuttings and embankments a mere crumbling of\r\nthe surface may be disregarded, but in dock, canal, or any works\r\ncontaining or expelling water, the smallest movement, crack, or aperture\r\nmust immediately receive due attention.\r\n\r\nIn order to effectually remedy a disease it is necessary to ascertain\r\nits character. Many of the primary causes of slips in cuttings and\r\nembankments are, therefore, here enumerated; but, of course, they are\r\nnot named in their order of importance, which cannot be established.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HEADS OF THE CHIEF CAUSES OF SLIPS AND SUBSIDENCES IN CUTTINGS.\r\n\r\n1. The want of uniformity of the earth, particularly as regards\r\npercolation, cohesive power, and resistance to change by the action of\r\nwater or meteorological influences.\r\n\r\n2. The temporary or permanent exposure of the earth to the effects of\r\nthe atmosphere, rain, frost, and snow.\r\n\r\n3. The opening to the air and weather, &c., of thin seams of an unstable\r\ncharacter, which, when unsupported, gradually crumble away and cease to\r\nsupport superimposed strata.\r\n\r\n4. The tapping of springs.\r\n\r\n5. The lower portion of a slope being impaired or undermined through an\r\ninfiltration and flow of water.\r\n\r\n6. The erosion of the slope.\r\n\r\n7. The earth having intermediate unstable seams.\r\n\r\n8. The unprotected surface of a cutting in light soil being loosened and\r\nblown away by a storm of wind, especially when it is accompanied by\r\nrain.\r\n\r\n9. The slopes being honey-combed and disturbed by rodents, particularly\r\nin clay soils, clay marls, and clay loams; and upon submerged earthwork,\r\nand in certain districts in the tropics by a mollusk which will\r\npenetrate and even destroy rocks.\r\n\r\n10. From one portion of a cutting being more exposed than another to\r\ndisintegrating meteorological influences.\r\n\r\n11. By the discharge of water from land drains following the old\r\ndrainage course, and by the localisation of the surface or land water\r\nflow.\r\n\r\n12. The improper or imperfect drainage of land outside a railway fence,\r\ncausing land water to accumulate in and discharge itself through the\r\nslope, thus disturbing the established equilibrium.\r\n\r\n13. By an interference with the natural flow of any underground waters.\r\n\r\n14. By allowing water to accumulate in the gullet, or upon the formation\r\nduring the process of the excavation of a cutting.\r\n\r\n15. The local percolation of water through the slopes of a cutting from\r\nthe defective construction, wrong location, or permeability of the\r\nsurface of a drain upon the cess.\r\n\r\n16. An accumulation of water caused by the unevenness of the slopes.\r\n\r\n17. The acceleration and inducement of a flow through the slope of any\r\nwater contained in land outside a railway fence, and consequent\r\nincitement to the land-water to exude.\r\n\r\n18. Vibration.\r\n\r\n19. Insufficient flatness of a slope either at the time of excavation or\r\nafter exposure to meteorological influences.\r\n\r\n20. The strain upon the face from lumps of earth being allowed to remain\r\nupon a slope during the construction of the works, or the gullet being\r\nexcavated for a considerable distance in advance; the cohesion of the\r\nsoil being thereby unduly and unequally strained.\r\n\r\n21. By overweighting.\r\n\r\n22. By unequal loading.\r\n\r\n23. The establishment of spoil banks upon the cess, or the additional\r\nloading of the ground near and outside a railway fence, in soft soils\r\nhaving practically no cohesion or tenacity.\r\n\r\n24. The excavation removed destroying the continuity of support,\r\nespecially in soils partaking of a semi-fluid character.\r\n\r\n25. The want of uniformity of the covering of a slope causing unequal\r\npercolation or exudation of water.\r\n\r\n26. The neglect to fill up, or otherwise remedy, cracks or fissures in\r\nthe slopes or cess.\r\n\r\n27. By artificial or irregular consolidation either of the formation or\r\nslopes superinducing movement and weathering in any portion not so\r\ncompacted.\r\n\r\n28. From an accumulation of water behind a retaining wall at the foot of\r\na slope, resulting in the stability of the wall being overcome by\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n29. By unequal pressure upon the foundations of a retaining wall at the\r\nfoot of a slope caused by lateral over-pressure tilting it, or by its\r\nunequal settlement.\r\n\r\n30. In sidelong ground, by the removal of support against the action of\r\nsliding, which, without artificial aid, may not be arrested until the\r\nslope of a cutting on the higher side approaches the steepest\r\ninclination of the face of the hill.\r\n\r\n31. By blasting laminated rock dipping at a considerable angle towards a\r\ncutting in the side of a hill; the result sometimes being that a cavity\r\nis made depriving the upper beds of support and causing them to\r\noverhang, and a mass extending to the top surface of the hill to slip\r\nalong the unsupported stratum.\r\n\r\nThe first ten “heads of the chief causes of slips in cuttings” might be\r\nclassed as NATURAL, _i.e._ produced or effected by nature and,\r\ntherefore, beyond the power of man to entirely prevent; the remaining\r\nheads as ARTIFICIAL, and therefore, in some degree to be prevented,\r\nunless obviously the result of the unavoidable exigencies of\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n   HEADS OF THE CHIEF CAUSES OF SLIPS AND SUBSIDENCES IN EMBANKMENTS.\r\n\r\n1. The percolation of surface water into the toe and under an embankment\r\nupon the original surface of the ground, and also downwards through the\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n2. Unequal percolation of water through the formation or the slopes.\r\n\r\n3. The surface of the ground upon which an embankment is tipped\r\ninclining in one direction, or falling on each side from the centre.\r\n\r\n4. The effects of rain, frost, snow, and the atmosphere on the deposited\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n5. By a crumbling of the lower portion of a slope.\r\n\r\n6. By a hurricane or extreme wind force, especially when accompanied by\r\nrain and the location is that of a narrow, steep valley, blowing away or\r\ndissipating the top and the surface of an uncovered embankment.\r\n\r\n7. By a slope becoming honey-combed by rodents, and in some few\r\ncountries by an embankment in a river or the sea being bored and\r\ndisturbed by crustacea.\r\n\r\n8. Insufficient slope for permanent stability at the time of or after\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\n9. The want of adhesion between the surface of the ground upon which an\r\nembankment is tipped and the deposited material.\r\n\r\n10. By the accumulation at the foot of an embankment of boulders or\r\nlumps having no cohesion, and no adhesion to the surface of the ground\r\nupon which they are deposited.\r\n\r\n11. The weight being too great upon the ground upon which an embankment\r\nrests.\r\n\r\n12. By unequal loading.\r\n\r\n13. An accumulation of water, caused by the unevenness of the surface of\r\nan embankment, or by the ground not being prepared so as to prevent a\r\nlodgment of water.\r\n\r\n14. By obstructing the established discharge of land-water or by\r\nattempting to divert the natural flow of underground waters.\r\n\r\n15. The localisation of the surface drainage.\r\n\r\n16. Water percolating into a benching trench, made to receive the toe of\r\na slope, thereby impairing the cohesion of the soil and reducing its\r\nweight-carrying capacity and stability.\r\n\r\n17. Vibration.\r\n\r\n18. The different nature and state of the earth tipped into an\r\nembankment and the consequent localisation of water in the more pervious\r\nsoil, causing unequal settlement, subsidence and movement.\r\n\r\n19. An embankment being tipped of material in a different state of\r\ndryness, moistness, hardness, softness, or in a frozen condition.\r\n\r\n20. The size and character of the earth, as excavated in the cuttings;\r\nfor instance, whether picked and shovelled soil, or lumps of excavation\r\nsimply barred away and deposited in small masses with earth approaching\r\na state of dirt or mud.\r\n\r\n21. Overpressure upon the material forming an embankment.\r\n\r\n22. The different conditions of the weather, when an embankment is\r\ntipped, causing portions to become dry, wet, or frozen.\r\n\r\n23. The lead or distance from a cutting to the place of deposition being\r\nof considerable length.\r\n\r\n24. The earth being loosened from vibration and concussion during\r\ntransit in the wagons, and in the process of deposition, thus causing it\r\nto be non-homogeneous.\r\n\r\n25. By the earth being tipped with greater impetus at one part than at\r\nanother place.\r\n\r\n26. An embankment not being tipped to its full width as it progresses,\r\nwhether in one or more wagon roads.\r\n\r\n27. First tipping the central portion of an embankment, and completing\r\nthe width and slope by side deposition after some time has elapsed.\r\n\r\n28. Tipping the contents of earth wagons from a considerable height,\r\nthereby loosening and separating the soil, causing the larger and\r\nheavier material to be near the foot of a slope and in lumps, and an\r\nembankment to have interstices and be temporarily or permanently\r\nunstable.\r\n\r\n29. Irregular consolidation, artificial or otherwise.\r\n\r\n30. Unequal exposure, particularly in embankments upon sidelong ground.\r\n\r\n31. Insufficient width of the formation, especially in high and exposed\r\nembankments.\r\n\r\n32. The junction of two embankments tipped from cuttings in different\r\nkinds of earth.\r\n\r\n33. No time being allowed for subsidence or consolidation before the\r\ndeposited earth is subject to varying loads and vibration.\r\n\r\n34. By allowing water to collect upon the formation and to form channels\r\ndown the slopes.\r\n\r\n35. The neglect to fill, or otherwise remedy, cracks or fissures.\r\n\r\n36. The want of uniformity of the covering of the slopes or top of an\r\nembankment causing unequal percolation of water.\r\n\r\n37. By a retaining wall at the toe of a slope preventing the discharge\r\nof water that has percolated through the formation and the slope.\r\n\r\n38. By an abnormal increase of the load upon the foundation of a wall\r\ncaused by lateral thrust and tilting forward, or fracture of the\r\nfootings or the concrete bed.\r\n\r\nThe first seven heads of “the chief causes of slips in embankments”\r\nmight be classed as NATURAL, _i.e._, produced by nature, and, therefore,\r\nbeyond the power of man to entirely prevent; the remainder as\r\nARTIFICIAL, and, therefore, more or less to be prevented.\r\n\r\nIn the case of earthworks made to contain or exclude water for the\r\npurposes of docks, canals, waterworks, reclamation of land, irrigation\r\nor drainage, &c., may be added, without reference to their\r\nconstruction:—\r\n\r\n1. Leakage along a discharge culvert, sluice, or tunnel in an\r\nembankment, or through the earthwork.\r\n\r\n2. Erosion of the land slope or backing of a retaining wall by waves, or\r\nspray falling thereon and necessarily passing over the top of an\r\nembankment.\r\n\r\n3. From abrasion and damage, caused by vessels or barges rubbing or\r\ncolliding against a slope.\r\n\r\n4. From erosion caused by wave action produced by the passage of boats\r\nor ships propelled by machinery; or by wind waves.\r\n\r\n5. Variation in the water level, causing unequal pressure.\r\n\r\n6. In the case of a reclamation embankment, it being closed from the\r\nends, and not by raising in layers, from the ground level.\r\n\r\n7. Variation of the submerged area, and consequent change in the degree\r\nof exposure to deteriorating influences.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the principal causes of slips in earthwork may be stated to\r\nbe air, water, frost and thaw, over-pressure, and vibration; the chief\r\nagent both in cuttings and embankments being water, which forces forward\r\nthe surface of the slopes and destroys the cohesion of the soil, and\r\nimpairs its frictional resistance until the earth is unable to sustain\r\nthe weight upon it; vibration aiding and completing the movement, as it\r\nnot only tends to loosen the soil, but may disturb the equilibrium of\r\nearthwork which is almost moving, and only requires a slight shock to\r\nset it in motion: in fact, vibration is frequently the complementary\r\nagency that causes a slip, and is obviously felt most in loose soils;\r\nbut if there should be fissures in earth of a tenacious character, or\r\nboulders in clay to disconnect it, the effect of vibration will be more\r\nserious in the latter case, as whole masses of earth may become\r\ndetached, instead of an equal settlement proceeding as with soils, such\r\nas sand and gravel, which may become consolidated by shaking, owing to\r\nwedging of the particles, should the slopes be sufficiently flat to\r\nprevent lateral movement; but it may detach portions of the slopes in\r\nsoil having little or no cohesion, and thus initiate a slip.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters the chief causes of slips in cuttings and\r\nembankments are considered, together with others bearing upon a solution\r\nof the subject, which is so interwoven that it is impracticable to\r\npreserve a successive order, but an endeavour has been made to\r\nseparately indicate the cause and some remedies that may be adopted: but\r\nbefore proceeding to particularise, it may be well to name a few\r\ndominant principles of the alignment of public works, which if duly\r\nregarded may tend to prevent slips of serious importance.\r\n\r\nConsequent upon financial and other causes, an engineer is usually\r\nrequired to so quickly prepare the necessary parliamentary plans and\r\nsections of public works, more particularly for railways, that it is\r\nbeyond the power of the most experienced to set out in a few hours the\r\nbest line of railway, &c., across a country, giving due consideration to\r\nthe parliamentary, constructional, economical working, district and\r\nthrough traffic, and financial requirements of the undertaking. There\r\nare, however, a few points which he may be able to regard respecting the\r\nstability of earthworks, some of which are now enumerated.\r\n\r\n1. Avoid cuttings or embankments in drift soil in or upon the side of a\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n2. Avoid all damming back or flow of the natural drainage waters, or\r\nheaping of snow by the erection of an embankment, especially in\r\nmountainous, hilly, or sidelong ground, and in an undrained district.\r\n\r\n3. When any excavation is in the side of a hill, observe the natural\r\nconfiguration of the ground in the wettest part, and remember that the\r\nslope of a cutting may not stand unless at the same inclination, or the\r\ntoe of the slope is supported by a massive retaining wall and extensive\r\ndraining, and that any disturbance may cause it to require a flatter\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\n4. Avoid river or stream diversions in earth of a very porous character;\r\nand should an embankment have to be erected near to a deep river having\r\na steep bank, locate the line a sufficient distance from the edge that\r\nthe slope of the river bank may be flattened when required, as an\r\nextraordinary flood may cause it to be unstable and to fall in, and in\r\norder to restore it to a condition of stability, it may be necessary to\r\nwiden the river and reduce the angle of inclination of its banks.\r\n\r\n5. In treacherous earth do not locate a railway close to a road, except\r\nat a station, as if the line be placed above the road, a slip upon the\r\nrailway may result in a slip upon the road; and should the line be below\r\na road, the extra weight or vibration may cause the road to follow the\r\nrailway and act, as it were, in unison with it.\r\n\r\n6. In treacherous soil, where practicable, have stations nearly upon the\r\nsurface of the natural ground.\r\n\r\n7. Remember that upon one side of even the narrowest gorge or valley the\r\nearth may be much more solid than upon the other.\r\n\r\n8. In exposed situations in a hilly country ascertain upon which side\r\nsnow remains the longer, note which receives the greater amount of\r\nsunshine, and is the wetter and more covered with trees and vegetation.\r\nIn a hill or mountain, the side to leeward of the prevailing winds\r\nalmost invariably receives the greater rainfall.\r\n\r\n9. In mountainous or hilly districts it may be advantageous to place a\r\nrailway or road at a high level upon the sunny side of a hill or valley,\r\nas obviously it dries quicker; snow does not accumulate with the same\r\nfacility, unless it happens to be exposed to the direction of the\r\nprevailing storms; the sunny side may be practically clear of snow, the\r\nshady almost impassable; but there is one drawback to the sunny side,\r\nnamely—the more frequent occurrence of snow-slips, which may or may not\r\nbe serious in extent. On the whole, experience seems to show that the\r\nwooded side of a valley is the best to select—sometimes one side is bare\r\nand the other wooded—unless there are special reasons to the contrary.\r\nIn the winter season in certain districts abroad, for instance, in parts\r\nof Afghanistan and the adjacent mountain passes, the days are sometimes\r\nas hot as the summer of European countries, but at night the thermometer\r\nmay fall below freezing-point, hence the value of tree-protection. It is\r\nobvious that in such climates the soil is peculiarly liable to\r\ndisintegrating forces, and likely to slip, unless of a solid character,\r\nand that upon one side earthworks may be stable, and upon the other\r\ntreacherous.\r\n\r\n10. In many countries it may be advisable to adopt a valley in\r\npreference to a hill-side line, especially if the district is free from\r\nfloods, or if the waters flowing down the side of the hills are\r\nconsiderable and suddenly appear, and there is a river and ample means\r\navailable of controlling the hill-side torrents and conducting them to\r\nthe river. If not, and the line must be on the mountain side, it may be\r\nadvisable, in exposed places where water rapidly accumulates and becomes\r\na torrent, to adopt the system of short tunnels round the hill spurs, in\r\npreference to deep cuttings, drainage, and slope protection works, and\r\nto place the railway or road at the highest level, so as to be free from\r\nthe influence of floods.\r\n\r\n11. Bear in mind that in high mountainous districts the drift deposit is\r\ngenerally torrential alluvium.\r\n\r\n12. Avoid as much as possible high embanked approaches to a river\r\nbridge, especially when a deep river, which frequently changes its\r\ncourse, is in a flat country.\r\n\r\n13. Consider if the simple erection of an embankment may in time cause\r\nits destruction, by the arrest or attempted diversion of the usual flow\r\nof the land waters.\r\n\r\n14. In treacherous soils, on the side of a cliff facing the sea,\r\ndetermine whether it is preferable to erect timber trestles at its base\r\ninstead of a solid embankment, or to place the line in a tunnel. The\r\ntrestles can either be erected upon sills, resting on the ground and on\r\nshort piles well secured from movement, or on piles driven some distance\r\ninto the ground. The system may also be adopted if the ground be of a\r\nyielding character.\r\n\r\n15. It has been noticed in some mountainous districts that the clouds\r\nbreak against the highest main ranges, discharge themselves on the\r\nsmaller ranges, and generally do not reach the inner ranges which rise\r\non the high table-lands; therefore, consider whether by locating a\r\nrailway or road near the latter, there is much less probability of a\r\nslip in the earthworks and less provision required for surface and flood\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n16. The configuration of a district through which a railway or road must\r\nbe aligned, may be such that its location becomes one more based upon\r\nplacing it on soil which is less bad or treacherous, than upon firm or\r\nstable ground. This is especially the case in hilly countries contiguous\r\nto the sea or large rivers. It may be optional to construct the works\r\nupon low or valley ground upon the side of a mountain or hill, or close\r\nto the sea shore or a river bank, which may require continuous defence\r\nworks to protect it from waves and erosion; or on table-land which,\r\nhowever, if impervious and retentive of moisture may act as a catchment\r\nreservoir between hills, and cause the ground to be always in a damp\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe character of the soil, the magnitude, and especially the average\r\nheight of the embankments, or the depth of the cuttings, the easy\r\ndrainage and discharge of the rainfall, and an economically constructed,\r\nmaintained, and worked line are the chief conditions to inseparably bear\r\nin mind in determining the location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE PROBABILITY OF A SLIP—TIME OF THE MOST FREQUENT OCCURRENCE—SOME\r\n    CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SLIPS AND SUBSIDENCES IN CUTTINGS AND\r\n    EMBANKMENTS MAY BE EXPECTED IN DIFFERENT EARTHS, SUCH AS ROCK,\r\n    CHALK, SAND, GRAVEL, CLAY, &C., &C.,—NOTES ON THE SLOPES OF REPOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of importance to know when serious slips are most likely to happen\r\nand under what conditions they are probable, for the process of\r\ndisintegration may commence immediately the earth is excavated, and be\r\nvery gradual, although the soil may remain stable for many months, or\r\neven a year or two, because the earth has not had time to be affected to\r\nthe point of instability.\r\n\r\nThe history of recorded slips appears to indicate that the most serious\r\nmovements of earth and those most difficult to remedy occur in the\r\nfollowing soils.\r\n\r\nDRIFT EARTH upon rock in sidelong ground.\r\n\r\nCHALK SOILS, as witness the slips in the early part of 1877 in the\r\ncuttings near Folkestone, and the more recent on the Calais-Boulogne\r\nRailway, and that in an embankment of chalk at Binham’s Wood, near\r\nBalcombe, in October 1853, when in a length of about 200 yards some\r\n70,000 cubic yards of earth slipped towards a valley. Probably this is\r\none of the most extensive recorded slips of a railway embankment of\r\nchalk; however, in this case the traffic was not stopped, but only\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nCLAY SOILS, especially the yellow clay; illustrated by the notable slip\r\nat New Cross, near London, when some 90,000 cubic yards of yellow clay\r\nmoved upon the smooth surface of a shaly clay bed and covered the\r\nformation: also the brown, and boulder clay, and the lias clays, as\r\nwitness the well-known recorded slips in the Midland counties of\r\nEngland, in which either aluminous or calcareous material may\r\npreponderate.\r\n\r\nThere are few, if any, earths in which the cohesion, weight-sustaining\r\npower and ability to resist the action of water and meteorological\r\ninfluences are practically the same at all depths, the different\r\nconditions, arrangement, and character in which they are found being\r\nalmost infinite, and there are earths which may become consolidated and\r\nwatertight if in a constantly moist and protected state, that when dry\r\nand exposed will shrink, fissure, and soon become unstable.\r\n\r\nConsequent upon cohesion, a cutting may stand for some time almost\r\nvertically; nevertheless stability cannot be considered as solely\r\nregulated by the cohesion of earth, for an embankment of gravel, sand,\r\nor broken rock with a proper slope and protected from erosion will\r\nusually safely bear more load than an embankment of clay, although the\r\nformer material may be said to have no cohesion; but the lateral thrust\r\nof dry, firm sand is known to be small, provided the sand is not\r\ndisturbed; also no earth can be said to be immovable under every\r\ncondition, but consideration of the soils particularly liable to\r\ndisturbance or mutation is, under ordinary circumstances, the main\r\nquestion to be determined.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions the exterior or faces of cuttings and embankments\r\nwill, at certain times, become impaired or soddened by the infiltration\r\nof water. In cuttings there is the additional danger, owing to the\r\ngeological formation, of the excavation reaching the depth at which\r\nwater is generally found in the locality, and it is therefore advisable\r\nto ascertain this level, and also to decide whether the ground must be\r\nexcavated below it, as necessarily there will be a downward flow, and\r\nthe slopes and formation will consequently have to sustain a pressure\r\ndue to the difference between the normal level of the water-bearing\r\nstratum in the neighbourhood and that of any depth beneath it. In such a\r\ncase, in addition to the usual softening and loosening aqueous action,\r\nthere is the particular insecurity of the formation and slopes being\r\nundermined and eroded by springs: also in pervious soil in a drained\r\ndistrict a cutting will be found to be comparatively dry to about the\r\nlevel of the bottom of the existing contiguous drains, but below that\r\ndepth water will be present, probably in considerable quantity. Land\r\ndrains also frequently cause slips, as they localise the flow of the\r\nsurface or underground waters, and when in excavating a cutting they are\r\nintercepted, the discharge should be led away from the slopes; but\r\ndifficulty may be encountered in effecting this, as water will usually\r\nfollow its original course, and it may be impossible to entirely divert\r\nthe direction of the flow, and the only thing to do may be to gently\r\nconduct the water down the slope by means of pipes, rubble, burnt brick,\r\ngravel surface drains, or timber ducts.\r\n\r\nAn important question to determine is, when are slips in earthwork most\r\nlikely to occur.\r\n\r\nIn Europe they are most frequent in the autumn and winter months; but no\r\nrule can be established, nor is it reasonable to conclude, because any\r\nearthwork has remained stable during the usual period when slips may be\r\nexpected, that, therefore, none will happen, for the heaviest rain may\r\ndescend at an unusual season, and as moisture is the chief cause of the\r\ninstability of all earths, it is rather to the quantity of the rainfall\r\nat any time than to the fixed seasons that attention should be directed.\r\n\r\nSpring being the driest season in England and autumn the wettest,\r\nOctober and November being the months of heaviest rainfall, slips are\r\nmore probable in the latter than the former season; but the first heavy\r\nand continuous rainfall after a period of estival drought is that\r\nparticularly to be feared, or the first rainy weather after a dry period\r\nirrespective of the season of the year; but serious slips may not occur\r\nfor many days or until the expiration of even a month or two after such\r\nrainfall, as the ground waters require time before they percolate to or\r\nreach the site of a cutting, and, therefore, all danger may be thought\r\nto be past when it is steadily approaching. The autumnal rains have to\r\nreplace the moisture that has evaporated during the summer, and this may\r\nnot, and usually does not if it slowly proceeds, produce instability in\r\nearthwork; but immediately the rainfall approaches or becomes in excess\r\nof the power of the natural absorption of the soil, the rain must flow\r\naway, for the earth being fully charged cannot contain it, the surface\r\nbecomes wet or the mass soaked, according to the degree of the\r\npermeability of the soil, and the quantity of rain necessary to produce\r\nsaturation; therefore, the state of the earth that induces a slip is\r\nthat most desirable to know; this cannot be absolutely established in\r\nevery case, for it depends upon so many influences, and obviously varies\r\naccording to the character of the earth, the varieties and conditions of\r\nwhich are practically infinite.\r\n\r\nIn countries that have dry and wet seasons, which cause the earth to\r\nbecome parched and then to be rapidly saturated, mere surface waters to\r\nbecome streams, and rivers torrents, slips are probable soon after the\r\ncommencement of the rainy season.\r\n\r\nWhen frost follows rain or a fall of snow, and the latter has descended\r\nupon a frozen surface and a thaw sets in, particularly if it be\r\naccompanied by a warm wind causing it to be very rapid in action, the\r\nearth is severely tried, for the frozen water in the ground becomes\r\nsuddenly liberated, while the surface is in a state of saturation.\r\nProbably the worst event that can occur for causing floods is when a\r\nsudden and rapid thaw follows a heavy snowfall upon frozen earth, as\r\nthen the snow will melt, and water cannot gently percolate the earth, as\r\nthe surface will be in a more or less frozen and impermeable condition,\r\nand the snow-water consequently must flow away.\r\n\r\nShould any excessive or violent rainfall succeed a period during which\r\nthe heat of the sun has caused fissures in the surface of the earth,\r\nallowing water to enter, the state of the soil is favourable to\r\nmovement. Land has also become unstable in mountainous countries because\r\na district has been deforested, or tree-protection much reduced,\r\nmovement of the earth usually happening after the first heavy rains or\r\nthaw succeeding frost or snow.\r\n\r\nIt has also been noticed that when an earth has become completely\r\nsaturated or water-charged, a sudden fall of the barometer to a low\r\npressure will liberate the pent up water which the soil cannot contain\r\nand cause it to burst out, the equilibrium having been so delicate.\r\nUnder such circumstances slips are nearly sure to ensue, and to be\r\nserious from their sudden action.\r\n\r\nExtensive slips in earthwork seldom occur during the excavation, or a\r\nshort time after the completion of a cutting; on the other hand,\r\nmovement in an embankment frequently happens during deposition. In the\r\ncase of an embankment, time may cause the earth to become consolidated,\r\nbut in a cutting the disintegrating and disturbing forces, and the\r\ncombined action of air and water percolating until they force forward\r\nthe earth, are usually gradual in their operation, and often require a\r\nyear or two to cause a state of instability; in fact, the history of\r\nslips, with a few exceptions, in soils whose condition is very readily\r\nchanged by water, indicates that serious movement in cuttings does not\r\ngenerally occur until a cycle or two of the seasons has elapsed, during\r\nwhich period meteorological influences, aided by vibration and other\r\ndeteriorating operations, are slowly and regularly proceeding, until at\r\nlength such a change in the general condition is caused that a slip\r\nhappens, apparently from some sudden agency, whereas the stability of\r\nthe earth has been gradually and surely wasting away for a long time;\r\nhence the importance of continual careful observation in cuttings even\r\nof moderate depth in doubtful soil.\r\n\r\nIn canals and works of a similar character constructed to contain water,\r\nif any movement or slip of earthwork takes place, it usually occurs\r\nwithin a short time of the water being admitted, and generally within a\r\nfew months and seldom after so long a period as a year, the ground in a\r\nshort time becoming consolidated, being exempt from severe vibration and\r\nmany of the disturbing agencies present in railway cuttings and\r\nembankments.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to ascertain the probability of a slip occurring, not\r\nonly should the superficial strata be considered, but also the original\r\nformation of the country; for instance, drift-soil, which is generally\r\nmet with upon the surface of sloping rocks, may consist of various\r\nearths intermixed in endless variety, and in every conceivable shape,\r\nand is not necessarily produced by a weathering of the rock upon which\r\nit lies, for it may have been brought from a distance. In any case,\r\ndrift-soil is the result of decomposition and disintegration, and from\r\nits nature is unreliable and ever subject to change, to slip, and to\r\nsubside, and so are most of the glacial deposits and moraine found in\r\nmountainous countries; and whenever the contour of a district is\r\nirregular and has numerous clefts, soft and marshy places, valleys and\r\nhills, earthworks will require to be protected against slips; also,\r\nshould a cutting be at the base of a cliff or hill, it will probably\r\nhave to be excavated in drift deposit and, perhaps, in silt if below the\r\nwater-level of adjacent sea or river, and the ground dips towards the\r\nnatural outfall of the land-waters. Such drift-soil may be alternately\r\ndry and charged with water from the rocks above, especially if they are\r\nmuch fissured and water-bearing and permit easy percolation of water,\r\nand must always be in a state of mutability.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ROCK.\r\n\r\nWith regard to slips in rock, or earth generally classed as rock, the\r\nunstratified or igneous rocks, although they are sometimes traversed by\r\nmineral veins and dykes, are the less likely to slip; but rocks liable\r\nto surface decomposition and disintegration, such as some varieties of\r\nbasalt and clay-slate, which latter by atmospheric and aqueous action\r\nwill partly return to its original state of being fine mud, thrown down\r\nfrom the metamorphic rocks, may change their condition and are likely to\r\nslip; and also limestone rock, which however resists the eroding action\r\nof water better than sandstone, may become separated by frost although\r\nits surface soon dries.\r\n\r\nSimply knowing the general character of a rock without ascertaining the\r\nproportion, state of the different particles of which it is composed,\r\nand whether any metamorphic action has taken place, is not necessarily a\r\nreliable guide to its stability. In districts situated at a high level,\r\nrocks are usually less permeable than in low-lying lands, and the\r\nsurface discharge is greater and quicker because of the increased\r\nrainfall, and less absorption and retention of water.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed whether there are dips in the surface of rock, as\r\nthey often contain unreliable material, such as pockets and pot-holes of\r\nclay, sand, mud, silt and detritus; and movement may be expected if it\r\nbe carelessly tipped with the rock into an embankment. Rocks which\r\noppose vegetation are usually hard and weather-resisting, and the faults\r\nand fissures local; but it is not so much the equal weathering of the\r\nface of rocks that is to be feared, as the presence and interspersion of\r\nseams, breaks and fissures, and it should always be borne in mind that\r\nthe condition of a rock varies considerably—it may be sound in one\r\nplace, and be fissured, disintegrated, and quickly weather in others—and\r\nthat all laminated and fissile earths are liable to slip because of the\r\npercolation of water down veins and crevices.\r\n\r\nThe durability of a rock may be approximately known by a careful\r\nexamination, commencing at the surface of the ground and proceeding\r\nuntil it is reached, the thickness and character of the different top\r\nsoils being noted, and particularly whether the degradation is uniform;\r\nbut rock, such as some sandstone, which allows water to ooze, permeate,\r\nor force a passage, is of doubtful stability. Weathering may be possible\r\nonly upon the surface or may gradually extend downwards, and as it can\r\nhardly be called a slip, the point to ascertain is not so much that it\r\nis sound and weather-resisting, as to know that there is no chance of\r\nany portion becoming detached or sliding, through the cohesion of the\r\njoints being impaired or destroyed by water, frost, or other agencies;\r\nfor in the case of rocks which show irregularities of stratification,\r\nmuch cleavage, or are separated by upheaval, or have synclinal and\r\nanticlinal folds, masses become detached along the line of cleavage and\r\nindependently of the normal stratification, therefore fissures or\r\nfaults, weak veins between masses of rock and crevices, or inclined beds\r\nthrough which water may flow and always be present; the direction and\r\ninclination of the dip of the strata, effects of weather upon the veins,\r\nand to know the weight upon sloping ground which the rock will bear\r\nwithout sliding down a hill are the main considerations; for rocks may\r\nbe distorted, upraised, contorted and tilted at every angle, and even\r\nhorizontal beds may repose upon the upturned edges of other strata.\r\n\r\nAn inclined water-bearing stratum between rock loosely bedded and\r\ninclined towards a cutting, unless drained and supported, will probably\r\ncause a slip consequent upon the action of water or frost; on the other\r\nhand, veins may alone hold the masses together, and, therefore, when\r\nthey are affected the cementing medium is destroyed; however, inclined\r\nwater seams are a frequent cause of slips, for where any water-bearing\r\nearth meets a closer and consequently less pervious stratum, damp\r\nsurfaces are produced, and an unstable condition; consequently, mixtures\r\nof rock, clay, and sand, are usually troublesome. Also in a cutting in\r\nsidelong ground if a stratified rock dips parallel, or nearly so, to the\r\nslope of a hill, slips are probable, as it may slide towards the\r\ncutting. Similarly, in a cutting in drift or alluvial soil, or any that\r\nwill quickly weather, resting upon rock, especially should it have a\r\nsmooth bed inclining towards the formation, the superimposed earth will\r\nusually be unstable, and even the act of penetrating the top stratum, or\r\nthe erection of a retaining wall or the weight of a small embankment\r\nupon it, may cause it to move; and when motion has commenced it is\r\ndifficult to arrest it; and should water trickle upon the surface of the\r\nrock, it may cause the upper stratum to slide; also when water flows or\r\nremains upon rock having a superimposed bed of shale or clay, the top\r\nstratum may not remain at rest even though the surface of the rock may\r\nbe nearly level and practically waterproof, and where rock beds overlie\r\nshale which is liable to become softened by time and water and to\r\nperish, particularly when the beds are twisted or contorted; as, for\r\ninstance, limestone or sandstone upon shale or marly-shale, the latter\r\nbecoming softened by the action of the atmosphere, water, or frost will\r\nform a sliding medium upon which the rock may move, or should shale\r\noverlie rock, as it frequently does, it may slide upon the hard surface.\r\nAll alternate beds of shale or any softer earth than the rock,\r\nparticularly broken shales when found mixed with sand and clay and the\r\nlias shales, and rock should be regarded as treacherous and liable to\r\nslip. Also some of the slate rocks, as they frequently have veins of\r\nlimestone, &c., and as the latter decomposes it mixes with the clay and\r\nbecomes of a marly character. Dark blue shale or indurated slaty clay is\r\nsometimes difficult to excavate, but when exposed to atmospheric and\r\naqueous action it breaks into pieces and becomes little better than a\r\ntreacherous clay. The cohesion of shale becomes less as it approaches a\r\ngreasy clayey condition, and, therefore, one readily affected by water\r\nor air, and it may then not stand at a steeper slope than 3 to 1. Rock\r\nand shale, which may stand at a steep inclination provided the beds are\r\nhorizontal, it has been found, do not permanently repose when they dip\r\ntowards a cutting until as flat a slope as 2 to 1 is given; and where\r\nclay and shale beds in cuttings are present, a slope of 1½ to 1 has been\r\ninsufficient, and they have not been stable till an inclination of 2 to\r\n1 has been adopted.\r\n\r\nAs cuttings in rock are frequently in the side of a hill, the dip of the\r\nstrata should be ascertained, and in the case of an unstratified rock,\r\nit should be known whether it is fissured or lies upon a solid and firm\r\nbed considerably below the level of a cutting, so that it may be\r\nprevented from movement. It should also be ascertained if the top\r\nstratum is a mere crust, such as a capping of conglomerate resting upon\r\nclay-rock, through which water may burst and cause it to separate, and\r\nsometimes the rock may be more solid in the valleys than upon the\r\nhill-side because of greater diluvial action, and induration caused by\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nThe crystalline rocks are the least easily destroyed and are generally\r\nrough and jagged. The science of geology shows that limestones,\r\nsandstones and clays, were originally heaps of mud deposited, removed or\r\narranged by water; and that boulders are transplanted masses from the\r\nparent rock, and are worn and rounded by mechanical attrition.\r\nConsideration of the manner in which rocks have been formed affords a\r\nfair indication of their stability in earthwork; for instance, many clay\r\nrocks are reduced to a pasty condition by the action of water and air,\r\nbut with different results according to their nature, some requiring\r\nblasting to excavate them. On the other hand, there are sandstones which\r\nalthough soft in the quarry become hardened when exposed to the\r\natmosphere. A dock cut in red sandstone when exposed to the atmosphere\r\nmay slip and fail, but if the rock be protected from the weather or\r\nconstantly covered with water it may be reliable.\r\n\r\nAs cuttings are near the surface and seldom at greater depths than 100\r\nfeet, it is hardly possible to know the angle at which a rock dips or\r\nwhether there are faults and fissures in it, unless an examination is\r\nmade upon the site, and this notwithstanding the geological character\r\nmay be thoroughly understood. Local conditions may cause peculiarities\r\nwhich no law can determine, and although at considerable depths, deeper\r\nthan railway or any works with the exception of well-sinking and mining\r\nare likely to reach, the nature of the earth is accurately ascertained;\r\nthe surface soil may be in almost every conceivable variety, and also so\r\ndislocated, denuded and rearranged, that usually horizontal strata may\r\nbe nearly vertical. Its character may be accurately known, but the lie\r\nof the surface beds or dip of the upper strata, or the order of\r\nsupraposition cannot be invariably absolutely established; for instance,\r\nwhen crevasses, fissures and veins are frequent in earth upheaved and\r\ndisintegrated by volcanic action, earthquakes and other disturbing\r\ncauses, as in parts of South America, Japan, and other eastern\r\ncountries, Italy, the Tyrol, Spain, &c., &c., slips of earthwork are to\r\nbe expected, and the soil is likely to be much inclined, full of faults\r\nand probably water-bearing seams.\r\n\r\nUnder the comprehensive name of rock is usually included any earth from\r\nthe hardest mass to be found to that which will crumble in the hand, as\r\nsoft sandstone rock. The chief absorbent rocks with which engineers have\r\nto do are the limestones, sandstones, chalk, and clay rocks. Rock may\r\nalso be simple or present the appearance of being homogeneous, or it may\r\nbe a mass of different substances, be flat bedded, have open or close\r\njoints, and be what is called—\r\n\r\nSolid rock.\r\n\r\nHard rock.\r\n\r\nDense, or compact, rock.\r\n\r\nLoose rock.\r\n\r\nRock in loose layers.\r\n\r\nLoose rock with cavities, caverns, and pot-holes of various earths.\r\n\r\nFissured rock.\r\n\r\nFriable rock.\r\n\r\nIndurated earth liable to be disintegrated by atmospheric influences.\r\n\r\nDecomposed rock.\r\n\r\nRotten decomposed rock.\r\n\r\nOr any mass of earth cemented together by a substance, weather-resisting\r\nor not, requiring blasting or that can be excavated by means of bars and\r\npicks.\r\n\r\nThe slope of repose required may range from overhanging or vertical to\r\nthat of the earth of which it consists when disintegrated and dissolved;\r\ntherefore the angle of repose varies considerably, but the following\r\ncardinal principles may be followed without fear under ordinary\r\ncircumstances and conditions.\r\n\r\nGranite. Quartz, if not fissured, and when little mica is present in it,\r\nand most of the igneous rocks,\r\n\r\n                   Overhanging, vertical, TO ⅛ to 1.\r\n\r\nAlso porphyry, gneiss, trap, but their stability varies considerably.\r\n\r\nCompact hard sandstone and limestone and other solid sedimentary rocks\r\nproducing stone sufficiently hard and weather-resisting that it can be\r\nused in construction,\r\n\r\n                       Perpendicular, TO ¼ to 1.\r\n\r\nBut, if non-weather-resisting,\r\n\r\n                           ½ to 1 TO 1 to 1,\r\n\r\nThe slope becoming flatter as the rock becomes softer and more easily\r\ndisintegrated.\r\n\r\nFriable rock, consisting of hard particles,\r\n\r\n                           ½ to 1 TO ¾ to 1.\r\n\r\nLoose rock,\r\n\r\n                           ¼ to 1 TO 1 to 1.\r\n\r\nSoft shaly limestone and the argillaceous rocks may not be permanently\r\nstable until the slope is,\r\n\r\n                           1½ to 1 TO 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nSchistose rock is troublesome in earthwork, being fissile in structure\r\nand deleteriously affected by rain and the atmosphere. On the Panama\r\ncanal works in the Culebra cutting, maximum depth 333 feet 6 inches,\r\nnumerous slips occurred, displaced the roads, and overturned the\r\nexcavators.\r\n\r\nMica-schist is variable and frequently has numerous water-bearing\r\nfissures. Its hardness depends upon the quantity of quartz it contains;\r\nwhen the proportion of mica is greater than the quartz it is soft and\r\nvery fissured and contains veins, sometimes of clay, often yielding a\r\nconsiderable flow of water. Should the percentage of quartz be large it\r\nbecomes hard, holds little water, and is of a gneissose character.\r\n\r\nAs water is the chief disintegrating agent and cause of instability, it\r\nmay be well to mention that Professor Prestwich has stated that “hard\r\nquartzites, slates and grits (Silurian), purple and grey shales, schists\r\nand fissile sandstones with hard compact limestones and dolomites\r\n(Devonian), rarely contain any _levels_ of water, and that it is only\r\nencountered in fissures”; hence the importance of knowing the position\r\nof the fissures, and taking the necessary precautions to promote\r\nstability. Where rocks, especially if generally known as water-bearing,\r\ncrop out at a high angle, and are in well-defined beds, water may be\r\nexpected, as although it may not percolate vertically, it will along the\r\ninclined beds. Sandstone and limestone bands in rock usually cause small\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nThe stability of a sandstone for earthwork and purposes of construction\r\nis dependent upon the material which cements or holds it together,\r\nwhether iron rust, lime, free silica, alumina, &c., &c., &c., its\r\nquantity and condition, and the degree of hardness imparted when it was\r\nformed, and the nature of the agglutinant; therefore the varieties and\r\ndegrees of fineness and hardness are numerous. Sandstones are generally\r\nfound to be laminated when hard; and bare of vegetation if pure and free\r\nfrom marls; they contain and part with water in different proportions,\r\nand sometimes have watertight bands crossing them, severing water\r\ncommunication, which may cause earthworks to be of unequal stability.\r\nThe firmest and strongest are close-grained and fine in texture, the\r\nweaker are coarse and gritty, and have a sandy appearance. They may be\r\nwhite, yellow, green, black, red, grey, brown, or other colour, and\r\nalthough of the same hue, their character may not be identical; for\r\ninstance, the red sandstone is hard and also very soft. Sandstone of a\r\ngreenish hue is generally hard, much fissured and full of water. When\r\nfirm, greensand may stand at a steep slope, the surface being protected;\r\nbut it varies considerably, and may at one place be close and yet be\r\ngradually deteriorated until it is of the character of fine loose sand.\r\n\r\nShould it be found upon excavating sandstone that it is not upon its\r\nnatural bed, but distorted, upheaved, or vertical, it will probably\r\nsplit and become detached under the destructive action of air and water.\r\nIn tropical climates it has been found that sandstones generally\r\ndissolve and become disintegrated when used in damp foundations.\r\nLimestone also varies much in character, and is treacherous, whether it\r\nis hard or soft, when pockets of clay or sand are present and beds of\r\nclay are contiguous. Percolated water having carbonic acid in it may\r\nalso soften or dissolve it. The softer kinds if in fragments as ballast,\r\nor when deposited in an embankment, often become quickly disintegrated\r\nby frost and the weather, as do sandstones.\r\n\r\nShould any rock strata be vertically inclined instead of horizontal,\r\nalthough it may be known in the latter case they are generally\r\nwatertight, fissures in the upheaved beds may become channels for the\r\npassage of the subsiding or rising waters, and may cause saturation of\r\nthe soil over a considerable area and induce a flow through the slopes\r\nor the seat of an embankment. Upon such a site no reservoir, dock,\r\ncanal, or any earthen structure to hold water should be placed; but\r\nalthough the nature of the ground may be fatal to the stability of such\r\nan embankment, so long as the underground waters do not rise to the\r\nlevel of the seat of a railway embankment or flood a cutting or burst\r\nthe slopes, they may not seriously affect the stability; for, unless the\r\nhead level of supply is great, more danger maybe expected from downward\r\npercolation saturating the ground upon which the embankment is placed\r\nthan from an upward flow. The insecurity of erecting a reservoir or\r\nsimilar work upon such a site, in which water is brought into a district\r\nin greater quantity than its natural flow, is obvious, as the earth may\r\ngradually become saturated from the constant leakage down the upheaved\r\nfissures, until it becomes in an unstable condition and finally slips\r\nand subsides.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHALK.\r\n\r\nAs in most public works, with the except:on of tunnels, wells and mines,\r\nthe chalk with which an engineer has to deal is surface chalk, or the\r\ntop layers of that deposit known as the upper chalk, almost invariably\r\ncontaining much more water than the lower chalk, although it rises\r\nquicker in the lower beds, as it is under greater pressure, and which\r\nvary in hardness, purity, and solidity and may have frequent fissures\r\nand holes, with or without flints, and be anything from hard, compact\r\nchalk rock to mere marly calcareous earth; considerable judgment is\r\nrequired to successfully determine the slope of stability and the\r\nprecautionary works that may be necessary to attain repose; for some of\r\nthe upper beds soon weather, and being soft, friable, and fissured are\r\npermeable and liable to slip; in fact, the Oolitic series, as it\r\nconsists of alternating bands of limestones and clays and occasionally\r\nsandstone, is frequently fissured and has loose joints and therefore\r\nrequires to be carefully treated.\r\n\r\nThe range of the slope of permanent stability obviously depends upon the\r\nnature of the chalk, whether it is denuded or covered or mere\r\nloose-jointed strata, the effect ground and surface waters may have upon\r\nit, and also the position of the beds, and whether a cutting or\r\nembankment is on the side or the base of a hill, and consequently at the\r\nplace where it is likely to be in a wet condition.\r\n\r\nThe Needle-rocks in the Isle of Wight and Beachy Head may be mentioned\r\nas familiar examples, showing that firm and comparatively pure chalk\r\nwill stand practically perpendicular, even when much exposed, if pure\r\nand free from faults and homogeneous in texture; and in blocks with beds\r\ninclined away from a cutting it will permanently stand\r\n\r\n            Almost vertically TO ½ to 1, at a great height,\r\n\r\na slow regular crumbling of the surface or falling down of small\r\nfragments, which seldom produce serious movement in such material, being\r\nthe only deleterious effect of weather influences.\r\n\r\nAs the chalk becomes broken and less evenly bedded,\r\n\r\n                             about 1 to 1.\r\n\r\nLoose, friable chalk in surface beds will often not permanently stand at\r\na less slope than from\r\n\r\n                           1 to 1 TO 1½ to 1,\r\n\r\naccording to the depth and degree of exposure. The most usual slopes\r\nbeing\r\n\r\n                           ½ to 1 TO 1 to 1.\r\n\r\nImpure wet chalk and marly chalk will require a slope not less than\r\n\r\n                                1½ to 1.\r\n\r\nMuch depends upon its freedom from faults, crevices, and pot-holes, as\r\nthey hold water, and the surrounding soil may fall away, for water\r\nquickly passes in quantity through the fissures and crevices which are\r\ngenerally numerous in the upper chalk, especially at the bottom of a bed\r\nof flints which in consequence of their impermeability lessen the upward\r\nflow; but flint beds in soft chalk are an advantage, as they act as\r\ndrains.\r\n\r\nThe affinity chalk has for water, which has been considered a reason for\r\nthe absence of important rivers in that formation, as water does not\r\nflow away freely upon it, causes it to be readily affected by rain and\r\ndisintegrated from the effects of the expansive and contracting action\r\nof frost and thaw; hence draining and covering the surface may be\r\nimportant, but care must be taken not to interfere with natural springs.\r\nThis property of chalk, viz., its affinity for water, although a\r\ndisturbing cause in earthwork in that formation is of value for covering\r\nor filling in open trenches, counterforts, or drains in _other_ soils,\r\nas the chalk attracts water, and therefore dries the surface of other\r\nearths.\r\n\r\nAnything that localizes the percolation or flow of water, or helps to\r\nmake water seams, veins, fissures, and hollows, which are sometimes\r\nfilled with sandy gravel, loam, and detritus readily admitting water,\r\nwill tend to break the chalk into separate masses and cause it to become\r\nloose and unstable by the action of rain, frost and thaw, and vibration.\r\nShould flint beds occur in chalk, and they frequently do in the upper\r\nbeds if they are horizontal or nearly so, much more water may be\r\nexpected to flow along their bed, as it forms a water-passage, than when\r\nthey are in inclined or vertical seams. As chalk absorbs much water, but\r\ndoes not readily exude it, although it may soon become dry upon the\r\nsurface after rain, it is advisable to lessen percolation in order to\r\nprevent slips. It is known that the angle of friction of water in chalk\r\nwill affect the flow and that the discharge varies greatly according to\r\nthe character, fracture, and other conditions of the soil; for instance,\r\nit has been proved that a hydrostatic pressure due to a gradient of\r\nabout 1 in 132 is required to enable water to pass through the chalk as\r\nfound at Dover, whereas in the Hertfordshire beds much less is required,\r\nnamely, that equal to a gradient of about 1 in 350 to 1 in 420. This is\r\nnamed as showing, even when unfissured, the varying perviousness and\r\ncharacter of chalk, and that it cannot be treated as a material of even\r\napproximate consistency of texture. The power of capillary attraction of\r\nchalk has been proved to be great and the evaporation from the surface\r\npractically unlimited. These properties and its known affinity for water\r\nrender it liable to constant change; also the particles of calcareous\r\nsoils being affected by moisture and to a certain extent soluble, water\r\nwill take up lime in them, and therefore they are treacherous earths and\r\nliable to slip and subside.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ansted has shown that a cubic foot of the upper chalk when\r\ndried will absorb 2½ gallons or 40 per cent. of its bulk of water; the\r\nlower chalk 2 gallons, or 33 per cent. of its bulk; and that the pores\r\nof a cubic foot of chalk are equal to 40 per cent. of the bulk, and are\r\ntherefore equivalent to the area of a pipe about 9 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nOrdinary drainage will not remove the water, hence chalk is a difficult\r\nsoil to treat successfully, and slips and subsidences may result in such\r\nlarge areas as the surface of cuttings and embankments simply through\r\nthe difficulty of preventing it becoming saturated.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of chalk, which requires careful observation to\r\nprevent slips, is that water does not generally issue through a mass, or\r\nequally over a consider able area, but is discharged through fissures,\r\nand crevices, and flint beds; hence one of the chief means of preventing\r\nslips cannot be adopted, namely, to disallow a localization of the flow\r\nof any water; therefore, the disturbing element of water seams is in\r\ngreater or less degree present in all chalk-earth that is not solid and\r\nhomogeneous in texture. The flow from such water-veins or seams should\r\nnot be interfered with, as any obstruction, and possibly diversion,\r\nwhich is likely to fail, will only result in the spring saturating the\r\nadjacent soil, and in its bursting out at another place. There is no\r\nsafe remedy but to gently lead away the water, for where springs occur,\r\neither in chalk or rock, they will find the line of least resistance;\r\nconsequently the waters of percolation will tend to flow to one place,\r\nand cause a spring.\r\n\r\nChalk is found in regularly stratified and separated masses, sometimes\r\ncaused by beds of flints, and although the position of the layers may\r\nindicate their successive ages, age can hardly be taken as an absolute\r\nindication of the increased stability of chalk in earthwork. When\r\noverlaid with clay it is usually harder than when bare, probably owing\r\nto pressure, non-exposure to atmospheric influences, and to the absorbed\r\nwater being of a different character, which has been proved by analyses.\r\nIt is especially advisable in chalk soils to know the head level of\r\nwater in the district, and to note if the bottom of a cutting is below\r\nthe usual water-bearing line in the open wells, which may not\r\nnecessarily be at the same depth; their average level being ascertained,\r\nan idea can be formed of the probability of springs bursting out, and\r\naccording as the rainfall is excessive or not, so usually will be the\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nIf chalk beds incline across a valley, and have an impervious stratum of\r\nclay upon them, it has been found that the most water issues at or about\r\nthe point where the impervious seam first overlies the chalk, _i.e._, at\r\nthe edge of the basin, and the greater its depth, the less the flow;\r\ntherefore, should a cutting be located at a place where this stratum is\r\nthinnest, more water from springs may be expected than at any point\r\nwhere the impervious layer is thicker.\r\n\r\nIt is also well to remember that the line of water-flow is not\r\nnecessarily a horizontal plane, for it frequently follows the contour of\r\nthe chalk, and that the causes of surface irregularities of subterranean\r\nwater are unknown; but rain-water accumulating in chalk principally\r\nrises and issues most rapidly along the bed lines; consequently the flow\r\nalong these must be gently discharged, or slips will occur; but chalk\r\nuniform in character and of solid and close texture, without flints and\r\nfissures, usually is not water-bearing, and will stand almost\r\nvertically. As a rule the cohesion of the upper beds, if they are\r\nhomogeneous, is greater than the lower beds, although the mass may be\r\nsofter.\r\n\r\nShould the drainage or natural outlet of the land waters of a chalk\r\ndistrict be obstructed or dammed back, from the quantity of water being\r\nin excess of that the fissures or water seams in a chalk hill can\r\ndischarge, and the pent up waters be unable to escape, hydrostatic\r\npressure, in addition to a weakened condition of the chalk through\r\nexcess of moisture, will be caused, and extensive slips may be expected\r\nalong the escarpment, the displacement being gradual, the ground\r\nseparating and fissuring until at length it is pushed out by hydrostatic\r\npressure. Such a slip usually occurs in large masses, resembling a\r\nfallen cliff, for the disturbing agent is all-powerful, and the area\r\naffected very considerable, and particularly so if the chalk is\r\nsuperimposed upon different soil, or harder ground, as then the whole\r\nmass will probably move forward.\r\n\r\nAlthough some approximate inclinations have been previously given, the\r\nvarieties of chalk are so numerous that no absolute slopes of repose can\r\nbe named, for chalk or calcareous earth may be:—\r\n\r\nMarble or crystalline limestone.\r\n\r\nOrdinary limestone rock.\r\n\r\nHard, compact chalk rock.\r\n\r\nLower white chalk.\r\n\r\nUpper white chalk.\r\n\r\nHard grey chalk.\r\n\r\nOrdinary grey chalk.\r\n\r\nPure white chalk.\r\n\r\nFriable white chalk.\r\n\r\nYellow, light and dark blue, soft chalk becoming of marly character.\r\n\r\nHard chalk marl.\r\n\r\nGrey marly chalk.\r\n\r\nGrey clayey chalk.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The preceding chalk marls contain so large a proportion of\r\nargillaceous matter as to become almost clays so far as regards\r\ntreatment in earthworks. Many serious slips have occurred in chalk\r\nsoils, and their history indicates that the chief disturbing element was\r\nwater, whether held back over a large surface until the hydrostatic\r\npressure became too great for the slopes to withstand it, or from its\r\nbursting out in springs, and so separating and disintegrating masses of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nNear the entrances to tunnels slips appear to be most frequent in\r\ncuttings in chalk. This would seem to lead to the belief that in places\r\nwhere it is known the chalk soil is likely to be troublesome from\r\nland-water and springs, it would be advantageous to prolong tunnels\r\nbeyond the economic depth of a cutting, and even to continue them until\r\nsuch a depth as 40 feet is reached, to so arrange the gradients that\r\nthey drain the interior, and to provide a complete system of pipes and\r\ndrains, even if side galleries have to be driven to tap the water,\r\nbefore it reaches the lining, to relieve the sides, crown, and invert of\r\na tunnel so that no water can pour down the roof or walls unless under\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nIn a tunnel so situated and liable to water-pressure, the thrust of the\r\nsoil will be very variable, and cannot be foreseen. At one place during\r\nconstruction, the walls and lining may be finished without movement of\r\nthe earth, at another, the pressure maybe great and act unequally,\r\neither upon the side walls or the arch. As a rule, at the entrances to\r\ntunnels the pressure is greater upon the arch than the sides, for then\r\nthe whole of the wedge-shaped mass within the boundary of the angle of\r\nrepose of the soil is disturbed, and its cohesion impaired or destroyed,\r\nand therefore it presses upon the arch, this pressure tending to\r\ncounteract the lateral pressure; but as the depth increases, the load\r\nfrom this wedged-shaped mass becomes less upon the arch, although\r\ngenerally greater than any lateral pressure, because the earth above is\r\nnot disturbed or impaired, consequent upon the depth of the hill being\r\ngreater and the cohesion and side-pressure of the earth tending to\r\nsupport it, but the lateral pressure is increased because the normal\r\npressure of the soil due to the depth is augmented. It is this\r\ndisturbance of such friable soil as chalk at tunnel entrances, causing\r\nthe particles to be loose and separated, and in a state especially\r\ndisposed to percolation of water, that probably causes the earth to be\r\nin a condition favourable to slips, and for them particularly to occur\r\nat or about the entrances to tunnels. When, therefore, the depth of open\r\ncutting at the entrances is reduced, any slip cannot be of the same\r\nmagnitude as it would be if it happened at a greater depth. The circular\r\nor one closely approaching it would appear to be the best form for the\r\nlining, where variable or great pressure, vertical or lateral, is to be\r\nexpected; for the pressure in a tunnel will always be unequal, and the\r\nsurface of the earth must be supported.\r\n\r\nIn some experiments to join substances by pressure it was found that\r\nthough great pressure forms chalk into hard blocks, the particles are\r\nnot firmly united, and that they separate along the surfaces of contact\r\nof the original particles and not through them; these tests tend to show\r\nthat masses of chalk are usually in a state not indisposed to\r\nseparation. The same result occurred in similarly testing pulverised\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SAND AND GRAVEL.\r\n\r\nIn fine sand-cuttings springs may be expected, and the earth become in a\r\nsemi-fluid state if there is water at a higher level to filter through\r\nit; also in the case of all porous and open soils. Any drawing away of\r\nthe sand must be prevented, as it will induce a slip, and cause the\r\nearth to become running sand, especially dangerous near buildings, for\r\nits egress must be prevented, or subsidence will ensue, and serious\r\nerosion. The excavation in such cases should be in as short lengths as\r\npracticable, so that the surfaces are not unsupported, and walls and\r\nstructures should be quickly erected. The sands that are met with in\r\nestuaries are frequently in such a condition, that a slight obstruction\r\nto the tidal flow will cause movement, the equilibrium being easily\r\ndestroyed. Should there be a break in the continuity of a clay stratum,\r\noverlying light loose soil, the latter will probably boil up, and in\r\ndetermining the depth of a cutting, care should be taken that this\r\nimpervious stratum is not broken or injured.\r\n\r\nMarl, clay and sand beds are likely to slip when they are superimposed,\r\nand there are some districts in which sandy soil is so charged with\r\nwater that, unless the drainage of the slopes and formation suffices to\r\ndrain for some distance the land outside a cutting, the sand will become\r\novercharged with moisture and will act as a fluid and slip, the lateral\r\nsupport being removed by the act of excavation and its normal condition\r\naltered. Being so delicately balanced the least additional disturbing\r\nforce, such as a spoil bank being tipped upon the surface, or the\r\ninducement or acceleration of a flow of water, will set it in motion and\r\nmake it a quicksand. For instance, small sand islands have been removed\r\nby making cuts in them from 15 to 20 feet in width, and by men shaking\r\nbars, &c., inserted in the soil; the sand along the edge becomes loose,\r\nfalls, and the current sweeps it away. As an example of the\r\nchangeability of the condition of sand may be named that in sinking pits\r\nby congelation in loose sand it has been found that the grains during\r\nthe freezing of the water, by means of tubes containing a freezing\r\nmixture, were additionally separated about 5 to 7 per centum.\r\n\r\nAs the sand met with in public works is seldom in very deep beds, it has\r\nnot been subject to the steadying forces which many earths have\r\nundergone, and it may have been constantly moving until its final\r\ndeposition, and therefore it is easily set in motion; and although sand\r\nwill subside less from a load after it is saturated with moisture, the\r\nwater in it trying to escape may cause it to slip upon an unsupported\r\nsurface such as a slope.\r\n\r\nMany experiments have shown that the power of absorption of sand\r\ndecreases with the fineness of the grain, and that sand when thoroughly\r\nwet will contain water equal to about one-third to two-fifths of its\r\nbulk, and that almost all this can be drained; hence its varying\r\ncondition and instability. If a well be sunk in sandstone and regularly\r\npumped it will drain the rock around for some distance, the drainage\r\nspace being conical, its vertex the bottom of the well, and its base the\r\nsurface, varying in extent according to the nature of the soil and depth\r\nof well, showing the porous nature of sand.\r\n\r\nThe interstices of silicious sea-sand, when not compressed, have been\r\nascertained by Mr. J. Watt Sandeman, M. Inst. C.E., to amount to about\r\n40 per cent. of the volume of sand. For coarse or fine sand, or a\r\nmixture of the two, the interstices did not vary much. When it was\r\ncompressed by a rammer in water, its bulk could be reduced to the extent\r\nof 12½ per cent. The interstices of broken red sandstone, varying in\r\nsize to that which would pass through an 8-inch ring, were found to be\r\n36 per cent. of the whole volume, but as the stones were in contact 10\r\nper cent, must be added, and if under water 15 per cent.\r\n\r\n                                                            Per cent. of\r\n                                                                the\r\n                                                            interstices.\r\n\r\n Broken Welsh limestone to pass a 3-inch ring                   50·9\r\n\r\n Gravel, free of sand.

Tipped\r\nsand when rammed will subside if saturated with water nearly as much as\r\nit can be beaten down, which shows how greatly its bulk is affected by\r\nwater, and although its rapid consolidation is an advantage in\r\nembankments, it is of importance that percolation should be equal.\r\n\r\nThe chief conditions of a safe foundation upon pure sand, namely, that\r\nit cannot escape laterally or be undermined, are obviously not to be\r\nattained in either cuttings or embankments, as the lateral support is\r\nremoved, and the slopes are liable to be undermined and unequally\r\ncharged with water, and the influence of water on sandy soils is the\r\nprincipal cause of their instability, for in excavating cuttings the\r\nface will frequently stand at a very steep slope if dry, but upon its\r\nbecoming saturated the sand may flow, and in the case of gravel and\r\nsand, although the stones forming gravel do not change, the whole\r\nsubsides.\r\n\r\nAs gravel is found in various conditions, it may be well to classify it\r\nas it is herein regarded.\r\n\r\nClean gravel is considered as that which nearly approaches the condition\r\nof a pebbly beach. If an appreciable quantity of sand is present, it is\r\nsandy gravel. If loam, or marl, or clay, it is loamy, marly, or clayey\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\nGravel hills are large accumulations of water-worn rocks, and may have\r\nboulders in them intermixed with the freshwater deposits of sands and\r\nmarls, and by means of natural cementing material between the particles\r\nseem to be firmly set and to be so conglomerated as to appear to be in a\r\nsimilar condition to weak concrete; but there is always a chance of the\r\nmatrix becoming dissolved, therefore it is advisable to test a mass by\r\nthe application of water and to expose it to the atmosphere before\r\nrelying upon its permanent stability, and with the view to determine\r\nwhether it is hard cemented gravel or not.\r\n\r\nGravel may be made more compact and will subside if water is pumped upon\r\nit and allowed to filter through, and in making an artificial foundation\r\nof gravel, it is not reliable without water percolation and\r\nconsolidation by ramming.\r\n\r\nAll earth consisting of particles having rounded surfaces is liable to\r\nbecome loose, and upon weight being placed upon it the grains are\r\ninclined to roll and become detached, but if they are angular fragments,\r\nwhich seldom is the case, this tendency will be lessened, and the angle\r\nof repose will be steeper.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the slopes necessary in sand and gravel, the more\r\nangular, rough, hard, and clean the particles, the steeper the\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nEarth that can be properly called gravel seldom requires a flatter slope\r\nthan 1½ to 1, and usually a less inclination is sufficient, but if loose\r\nit will not stand vertically even for a depth of a few feet.\r\n\r\nSolid indurated masses of gravel will stand perpendicularly and as rock.\r\n\r\nIf the gravel consists of quartz or sandstone boulders, or is very\r\ncoarse with stones of considerable size, or like a clean pebbly beach, 1\r\nto 1 TO 1¼ to 1.\r\n\r\nOrdinary clean gravel of uniform size at about 1 to 1.\r\n\r\nThoroughly compressed, hard, clean sand, about 1 to 1.\r\n\r\nLooser sand and light gravel, 1¼ to 1 TO 1½ to 1.\r\n\r\nIrregular beds of sand, gravel, clay, and fragments of rock, 1¼ to 1 TO\r\n1½ to 1.\r\n\r\nSand mixed with vegetable matter, argillaceous or loamy sand, about 1½\r\nto 1.\r\n\r\nAs the proportion of mould or clay in the sand becomes greater a flatter\r\nslope is necessary according to the nature of the earth with which it is\r\nincorporated, the degree of wetness, and also the exposure of the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nClay loams require slopes from 1½ to 1 TO 3 to 1, and shifting sand when\r\na current of water reaches it will become a quicksand, and not be stable\r\neven when horizontal, but if drained and the toe is secured it will\r\nusually stand at an inclination of from 3 to 1 TO 4 to 1. On the other\r\nhand, an embankment of hard, clean, angular sand, rammed but left bare,\r\nwhen exposed to tidal action with little wave disturbance, has reposed\r\nat 2 to 1 TO 2½ to 1 slopes.\r\n\r\nLoamy soil and vegetable mould will, for any height not exceeding about\r\n5 feet, stand nearly vertically for a reasonable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CLAY.\r\n\r\nWith respect to cuttings and embankments in clay soils, perhaps no earth\r\nis more affected by water and air, or more difficult to treat, as it\r\nwill expand if only exposed to the atmosphere and without contact with\r\nwater, 6 inches being no unusual dimension to allow for expansion in\r\ntunnel-work. This property and its contraction upon drying alone make it\r\nan earth particularly liable to slip and induce fissures and cracks\r\nthrough which water can trickle, notwithstanding the surface of the clay\r\nmay be almost impermeable. If clay could always be kept dry or in its\r\nnatural condition it would be stable and free from slips; but this\r\ncannot be effected, for water is held in suspension in clay for a\r\nconsiderable period, its plastic nature preventing gravitation, and\r\nevaporation is known to be a very slow process; and as the same clay\r\nunder different circumstances may stand nearly vertically or only at a\r\nvery flat slope, its liability to constant change makes it very\r\ntreacherous, and it should be classed as a most deceptive earth of a\r\ndangerously unstable and unsafe description, for it may be so hard as to\r\nnearly turn a pick, and yet water and air will rapidly cause its\r\ndisintegration, but if weather influences can be prevented from reaching\r\nit when in such a hard compact state it will afford a firm foundation.\r\n\r\nLondon clay in its natural condition usually contains about 10 per cent.\r\nof water. The more permeable the clay the more likely are slips to occur\r\nand the face to become soft, loose and disintegrated, slimy beds being\r\nthus produced which are difficult to prevent or remove; therefore a\r\ncovering of close grass turf, or layer of burnt ballast, ashes, or\r\nchalk, upon any damp place or fissure after it has been filled is\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\nSolid blue clay, which generally requires the use of the pick, of the\r\nclays is, perhaps, the most stable, being almost impermeable if free\r\nfrom delaceration; but yellow and most other clays are unequal in\r\ntexture, faults and breaks are frequently numerous, and water\r\npenetrating converts the surfaces and the mass into a muddy and\r\nsemi-fluid condition resting only when horizontal, which has been\r\npainfully experienced in the crushing in, during construction, of some\r\ntunnels in the London district. The trickling of water down fissures\r\nforms a slimy and easy-sliding surface most difficult to treat or\r\nprevent, and so long as the natural contour of the ground does not offer\r\nresistance to movement, a slip may extend for a long distance, either in\r\ndeep or shallow cuttings, and there may be considerable hydrostatic\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe disruptions, variableness of character, and existence of fissures\r\ncause any but the most homogeneous clays to be treacherous and likely to\r\nslip, particularly the yellow and any laminated clays, as they allow\r\nwater to enter by the veins which are usually frequent in the mass.\r\nYellow clay has a greater tendency to crack upon drying than blue clay\r\nand does so much more quickly, hence its dangerous nature, and although\r\na mass may be only damp, fissures will enable water to penetrate and\r\nreduce it to a state of instability; it is also not infrequently in a\r\nplastic state, having fissures and cavities full of water.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, not be forgotten that in the endeavour to prevent\r\nthe deleterious effects of aqueous action upon clay soils that they may\r\nbe over-drained, so that they become too dry, as then the clay will\r\nshrink, crack, and fissure; the chief aim should be to keep it always in\r\na sufficiently moist state so as to obviate the formation of cracks and\r\nfissures, and at the same time cause it to be dry enough to be firm, and\r\nnever in a pasty or pulpy condition; in other words, to maintain its\r\nnatural state if one of stability, and prevent any excess of water\r\npenetrating it or reaching its surface.\r\n\r\nThe lias clays are treacherous chiefly owing to the presence of much\r\ncalcareous matter, and therefore approach a marly state; heavy slips\r\nhave occurred in the has formation in the midland counties of England,\r\nnotwithstanding that a slope was adopted which experience had shown\r\nproduced stability, namely 3 to 1. A slight variation in the composition\r\nof this soil or an unfavourable position will cause a slip in such\r\ntreacherous earth.\r\n\r\nPure clay shrinks some 5 per cent. in drying, the contraction being less\r\nas sand is present in it, for when it is mixed with twice its weight of\r\nsand it is reduced to 3 per cent., and as impurities increase in clays\r\nthe less impervious they become. Most clays have silicious earth in\r\nthem, but if sand is present the clay is then more open, and water will\r\npermeate and drain more freely; but mixtures of clay and sand may assume\r\na pulpy condition when impregnated with water, consequently it is always\r\nadvisable to test such earth. The varieties of sandy clay are many, and\r\nall are usually more or less unstable. Among them may be named red clay\r\nwith sand and mica, blue sandy clay, sandy green clay, stiff red sandy\r\nclay, the loamy clays of various hues, dark grey, red sandy, and black\r\nclayey loams.\r\n\r\nIf clay could be kept in a moist state fissures would seldom occur. The\r\nconstant alternation of wetness and dryness creates the fissures, and\r\nwater completes the disintegration. There are a few clays which are\r\nstable when kept in solid masses, as then only a small surface is\r\naffected by air and water, but if they are loosened and broken up, as in\r\nthe process of excavation and deposition, they readily become in a muddy\r\ncondition. Any mud or silt which may be soft and readily pressed when\r\nwet, but cakes and shrinks in to detached lumps when dry or upon being\r\nexposed to the atmosphere, is a treacherous soil, as it will return to\r\nits original state upon becoming wet. Clays or any soils that cake\r\nshould always be regarded with suspicion, as although having the\r\nappearance of solidity and the possession of weather-resisting qualities\r\nin their natural position, when disturbed, quickly become worthless for\r\nearthwork purposes, and may stand in one situation almost as a soft\r\nclay, and when disturbed and wet assume a horizontal surface. Such\r\nground may repose at a 4 to 1 TO 8 to 1 slope, because its crust has\r\nbecome caked or case-hardened, yet when it is broken it may become, upon\r\nbeing exposed, simply fluid mud. To prevent clay soil weathering upon\r\nthe surface, a layer of gravel 1 foot or so in thickness has been placed\r\nupon it, the idea being that it is not only a protection, but the weight\r\nof the covering upon the clay will cause the water to be pressed out\r\nfrom the soil into the gravel through which it can percolate to the\r\ndrains.\r\n\r\nA crude test to indicate the probable character of a clay as regards its\r\nstability in earthwork is to burn a piece of it and notice the colour.\r\nIf it becomes white or of a whitish tint, the clay is generally less\r\nlikely to slip than when it is of a reddish or yellowish tinge. Another\r\nrough experiment can also be made. Get a piece of clay, place it in\r\nwater, and note the time taken and the depth to which the surface has\r\nbecome saturated, and whether it is very slimy and will easily slide\r\ndown a slightly inclined plane; its tenacity may then be approximately\r\njudged. Also by weighing, an idea of the amount of sand may be imagined;\r\nthe more sand there is in clay the lighter it will be, all other\r\nconditions being identical. A comparison between two clays will enable\r\nsome opinion to be formed of their relative stability in earthwork,\r\nthough, of course, there are many other features to be considered. All\r\nimpure clays, such as shaly clay, sandy clay, loamy clay, and marly clay\r\nrequire to be carefully treated, although they may be easier to manage\r\nthan yellow or brown clay.\r\n\r\nWhen two retentive clay beds overlap or overlie, and have no\r\nintermediate permeable stratum, they must be in a humid state, as is the\r\ncase in the Fen country, unless they are constantly drained; but serious\r\nslips are not so likely to occur in them as when two masses of clay have\r\nan interposing seam of sand or silt liable to be eroded by water falling\r\ndown fissures in the clay, which probably extend to considerable depths,\r\nwith the result that two slimy surfaces are formed and the clay slides.\r\nClay underlying gravel often contains numerous pockets and seams filled\r\nwith running sand, and should there be a permanent head of water the\r\ndischarge will be in large quantities and at a considerable velocity. A\r\ncutting in wet sandy clay is generally treacherous and difficult to\r\nmanage.\r\n\r\nAs a clay bed near the surface of the ground is sometimes upheaved, if a\r\npermeable stratum such as gravel or sand overlies it, the drainage of\r\nwater through or down the slopes will be arrested, and the earth at the\r\nback of the slope will be constantly wet and may ultimately become\r\nsaturated through the damming back of the water; then a slip may be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nAll upheaved, dislocated, and twisted superficial beds of clay, which\r\nwill generally be of varying consistency and therefore settle unequally;\r\nover or underlying seams of sand or gravel, are likely to slip and\r\nsubside, and their stability much depends upon whether or not the lie of\r\nthe beds obstructs the permeation of water. If the dip of the clay-beds\r\nis towards the natural outfall, most probably an adjacent river, slips\r\nare probable because of the creation of sliding surfaces and the\r\ncontinuity of the beds being destroyed by a cutting and the consequent\r\nloss of support.\r\n\r\nShould permeable soil lie between the top stratum and a bed of clay,\r\nwater will accumulate upon the clay, make it slimy and cause a flow upon\r\nthe bed; for example, when a thin bed of vegetable earth rests upon\r\ngravel, sand, or peat, and that upon clay, water will percolate, and\r\nperhaps air, through the top soils, and may cause them to slip upon the\r\nclay-bed. Also should a layer of clay overlie permeable strata, as clay\r\nupon sand, or clay upon gravel, unless it is sufficiently thick and\r\nsolid to prevent infiltration, it may slide upon the permeable soil as\r\nits lower surface becomes wet. When clay-hills have veins, water may\r\naccumulate in them and flow, and if very dark yellow clay overlies light\r\nyellow calcareous clay, which may rest upon hard blue clay, it is\r\nobvious each stratum is somewhat differently affected by weather and\r\nair, and therefore movement is to be expected. The edges of clay-hills\r\nare always likely to slip, especially should they be in the form of\r\nspurs.\r\n\r\nBoulder-clay is seldom reliable, because, although it may be hard and\r\nstand vertically in dry weather, in wet it swells, weathers quickly,\r\nbecomes soft and cakes upon drying. The stability of such soil is\r\ngoverned not only by the nature of the clay, but by that of the boulders\r\nand their effect upon the earth in which they are embedded, and much\r\ndepends upon the degree of changeableness upon exposure to air and\r\nmoisture of all the particles of which they are composed; hence\r\nboulder-clay, although hard to excavate, may quickly dissolve. On the\r\ncontrary, it may occasionally be so hard that it seems to be solid rock,\r\nand may even resist erosion and weathering as well as if it were rock;\r\nbut care must be taken to prevent indurated mud being mistaken for solid\r\nclay-rock, and therefore it is advisable to test the soil with water.\r\n\r\nSeams of silt, soft pasty soil, or soapy earth met with in clay, which\r\nhave become decomposed by atmospheric and aqueous action, are to be\r\nfeared, and the brown clay, especially when soft: red, or dark yellow\r\nclays that break into laminæ and crumble upon exposure to the air, and\r\nalthough tenacious in the flakes and when fresh-cut are loosely held\r\ntogether in bulk, often have thin veins of sand in them; and when water\r\npercolates it remains, and is very difficult to drain. It has also been\r\nfound that when minute non-adhesive particles of mica are present in\r\nclay that it will become disintegrated by water, although it may be hard\r\nto excavate. Some of the gault clays, although stable when dry, become\r\nsoapy when wet and are not easily managed, but the bluish grey gault is\r\nusually tenacious and almost impermeable. The gault clays have little\r\nsand in them but much calcareous matter, and, as a rule, they do not\r\nswell and bulge like the London clays.\r\n\r\nSome clays, when dry, appear to be stable and firm, though they are\r\noften drift or dried-up mud simply requiring the influence of water and\r\nthe atmosphere to cause them to return to their original state; the\r\nbrown and boulder-clays are of this nature and are distinctly perishing,\r\nand therefore treacherous clays.\r\n\r\nAs in clay and all retentive soils, water is always present, and as the\r\nimpervious nature of clay prevents water gravitating and being drained,\r\nand as owing to wet seasons the permeable portion of the clay may\r\ngradually become overcharged and be reduced to a muddy condition, slips\r\nmay occur years after a clay cutting has been excavated or an embankment\r\ndeposited. In clay embankments the greater weight upon the centre may\r\ngradually press water towards the slopes and cause them to slip; hence\r\nthe value of covering the formation in order to lessen percolation.\r\nCracks and fissures may be so produced in clay embankments, and the\r\ndanger is that they form sliding surfaces and cavities from the presence\r\nof water, and gradually soften the interior until it fails from the\r\nthrust of the earth and want of uniform support; therefore, clay earths\r\nare more difficult to treat than granular soils, as local weakness is\r\nthe cause of failure, a mass may be sound, but a crack or fissure may\r\nsoon become large and pass through an embankment to the seat or the\r\nslopes. Although the filtration of still water may not cause an\r\nembankment to slip as long as the water merely restores it to its normal\r\nabsorbing power, when that is exceeded the percolating water will be\r\ndammed-up and cause hydrostatic pressure and a soddened surface, destroy\r\ncohesion, and disintegrate the particles.\r\n\r\nWhen clay is contained within the walls of a building, injurious action\r\nand unequal settlement may arise, as the earth inside and outside may be\r\nin a different condition; consequently in soils that expand and contract\r\nthere may be external or internal pressure according to the state of\r\ndampness or dryness, consequent upon the ground outside being subject to\r\nweather influences and the contained earth being comparatively free from\r\nsuch operation.\r\n\r\nShale, whether black or brown, may become decomposed by water and be\r\nsoftened by time, and is either loose or firm. If loose, it requires\r\nprotection, and the surface should not be exposed to the weather. The\r\npresence of iron pyrites in shale has been found to be a cause of its\r\nbecoming treacherous when water has access to it, as the mass becomes\r\ndecomposed.\r\n\r\nMarly soils are of various hues, red, blue, grey, and yellow, and\r\nconsist principally of clay and lime, and are usually called clay-marls\r\nwhen clay preponderates, and marl-clays or chalk-marls when chalk is in\r\nexcess. They are dry to the touch and will effervesce with acids, the\r\npresence of lime being thus made evident by the ebullition produced, and\r\nsome idea of the relative quantity may be judged by comparing results\r\nwith different lumps: they vary in character according as lime or clay\r\npredominates.\r\n\r\nChalk-marl may act as an almost impermeable stratum and arrest the\r\npercolation of water from more permeable soil, but it is liable to slip\r\nbecause of fissures being present in it, which are common to most\r\ncalcareous earths; and when these crevices are bared in cuttings by the\r\nground being excavated, the flow from the previously-confined or\r\ndiverted springs is facilitated, and perhaps the harmless underground\r\npassage of water is prevented, and consequently the earth may become\r\nloosened and unstable owing to the changed condition.\r\n\r\nAlthough marl may be so hard that it cannot be excavated by picks and\r\nbars, but requires blasting, some varieties crumble and become soft\r\nunder weather influences, and the slopes need protection, or a constant\r\ntrickling and wearing away of the surface will result. Grey marl\r\ngenerally weathers quickly, and if there is much clay in it, it often\r\nfalls to pieces upon exposure to the air, and becomes broken and so\r\nsplit into disjointed pieces as to admit water, and as it sometimes\r\ncontains a considerable quantity of sand it is soon reduced to an\r\nunstable state, for marl-clay and sand beds are always likely to slip.\r\nThe variegated marls are treacherous, but red marl is usually stable,\r\nstill it must be lined in tunnels; and so are those that are impermeable\r\nor closely approach that condition, but any marl in which the lime may\r\nseparate from the mass is unstable. All clay or marl soils that soon\r\nwork into “slurry” may be classed as treacherous, or any earth that\r\nquickly becomes in a liquid state; for instance, some of the hard “pan”\r\nsoil met with in Canada melts away by the action of air, rain, snow and\r\nfrost, and becomes unmanageable and like blue paint, and will quickly\r\nfill drains and run down the slopes and cover the formation of a\r\ncutting. Also the top black cotton soil found in India expands by\r\naqueous action, and contracts in drying as clay, and is of doubtful\r\nstability.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the more argillaceous or clayey marls when exposed\r\nto weather influences expand, contract, and act almost as clays,\r\nbecoming decomposed, disjointed and separated, and when superimposed\r\nupon rock, especially if it be inclined, are very likely to slip, and\r\nare treacherous and unstable soils, as they soon become in a muddy state\r\nand have slimy surfaces, which, when resting upon any dipping bed, cause\r\nthem to be disposed to move upon the smallest disturbing element being\r\npresent or becoming increased, such as water or vibration. When a\r\ncomparatively permeable stratum overlies even hard marl, water will\r\npenetrate to the latter earth and the superimposed layer will rest upon\r\nan unstable bed, and therefore be likely to slip. Blue, or any marl when\r\nfound mixed with layers of small gravel and sandy clay is very\r\ntreacherous, as air and water cause it to swell and crumble, and it\r\nbecomes in a soft state requiring a very flat slope. All clay marls that\r\nswell when wet, and crack and fissure when dry, are unstable, as water\r\npercolates to them, and should sand veins occur in marl, water may\r\ntrickle to a considerable depth and cause the ground to be in a loose\r\nand doubtful condition below the formation or bottom of a cutting. Such\r\nsoil when tipped into an embankment is worse to treat than in a cutting,\r\nas it will absorb and retain water so that it is practically impossible\r\nto drain or extract it.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ansted has classed clay soils as under:—\r\n\r\nWhen combined with 30 or 40 per cent. of sand they are CLAY LOAMS.\r\n\r\nWhen combined with 40 to 70 per cent. of sand they are TRUE LOAMS and\r\nLOAMY SOILS.\r\n\r\nBut not until they have 90 per cent. of sand in them are they SANDY\r\nSOILS.\r\n\r\nWhen combined with from 5 to 20 per cent. of lime, the soils become\r\nMARLY.\r\n\r\nBut not until they have more than 20 per cent. of lime in them are they\r\nCALCAREOUS SOILS.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the slope of repose in clay earths, it may be anything\r\nfrom 1 to 1 TO 12 to 1, and when the clay is mere dried mud and becomes\r\nsaturated it may not be at rest until it is horizontal.\r\n\r\nIn cuttings, strong compact clay, if not seriously impaired by air and\r\nmoisture, will stand at from,\r\n\r\n                           1¼ to 1 TO 1 to 1.\r\n\r\nOrdinary clay, such as the blue clay, with protected slopes and proper\r\ndrainage, and firm boulder clay,\r\n\r\n                             about 1½ to 1\r\n\r\nPlastic clay from,\r\n\r\n                           2 to 1 TO 3 to 1.\r\n\r\nLias clays of doubtful character,\r\n\r\n                           3 to 1 TO 4 to 1.\r\n\r\nSuperficial beds of London clay,\r\n\r\n                                3 to 1,\r\n\r\nand not less for any weak clay.\r\n\r\nIn embankments, much depends upon the height, mode of tipping, state of\r\nthe soil when deposited, the protection afforded and uniform character\r\nof the mass, the larger it is the more difficult it will be to drain.\r\n\r\nAlthough firm clay may for a short time stand at nearly a vertical slope\r\nfor any height of face not exceeding about 10 to 12 feet, few clays will\r\npermanently stand at a less slope than,\r\n\r\n                     1½ to 1, for moderate heights,\r\n\r\nalthough they may for a time do so at 1 to 1 in unsubmerged work, but if\r\nthe slope is covered with water, as in a canal, and subject to wash or\r\nwave action, however shallow the depth, it is seldom they repose at a\r\nless inclination than 1½ to 1.\r\n\r\nShould an embankment be more than about 30 feet in height\r\n\r\n                            2 to 1, average.\r\n\r\nFirm clay from,\r\n\r\n              1½ to 1 TO 2½ to 1, according to the depth.\r\n\r\nPlastic-clay, consequent upon the percolation and pressure of water in\r\ncuttings, may stand at a steeper slope in a surface protected\r\nembankment, and if carefully tipped, it will repose at from\r\n\r\n                           1½ to 1 TO 2 to 1,\r\n\r\nbut from hydrostatic pressure the same clay may require from 2 to 1 TO 3\r\nto 1 slopes in cuttings, and even an inclination of 5 to 1 has been\r\nfound to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe varying slope-system is referred to in Chapter VI., as also the\r\nrange of slopes.\r\n\r\nIt is always well to bear in mind that in the case of clay, loamy or\r\nmarly soils, or any possessing soluble particles, the quantity of water\r\nin them governs the required flatness of the slope, and as it may be\r\nvariable, a clay that will repose at a certain angle may slip upon\r\nreceiving an additional amount of water, hence the importance of\r\ndrainage and protection. The cohesive strength of clay also varies\r\ngreatly; and as it is likely to be impaired, and, perhaps, destroyed by\r\nwater and other causes, it should be considered as of fluctuating value,\r\nand therefore as generally unreliable.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of repose required in river-banks have a wide range according\r\nto the degree of exposure and opposition to the free flow of water, and\r\nthe protection given to the surface. In canals, and drainage-channels,\r\nor ordinary rivers, they range from 1½ to 1, when protected, to 5 to 1;\r\nbut there are numerous small, shallow, and sluggish streams with almost\r\nvertical banks. As the earth of river-banks is frequently of a clayey\r\nnature the slopes are referred to under the head of Clay; usually it is\r\nmixed in character, and, therefore, the slope of stability cannot be\r\ndetermined from that of any particular and unalloyed soil. Towards the\r\nmouth the land often consists of detritus liable to be washed away by a\r\nstronger flood than that by which it was deposited; it may also be\r\neroded by constant or increased wave action. Ordinary clayey, loamy,\r\ntenacious, or not easily moved, silt and sand river-banks, in a current\r\nthat will not erode them at moderate depths, if the face is protected,\r\nwill stand at an inclination of about 1½ to 1, when the channel is\r\nfreshly cut.\r\n\r\nIf not covered or protected at from 2 to 1 TO 3 to 1, but when in clay\r\nsoil of a doubtful character and non-homogeneous, or boulder-clay, about\r\n4 to 1.\r\n\r\n2 to 1 TO 3 to 1 is the most general slope; but in marsh land, unless\r\nthe surface is protected, they may not permanently stand at 5 to 1.\r\nFascine-work may be the easiest and most convenient protection, or a\r\ngravel or turf-covering may suffice, and should new channels have to be\r\ncreated, the question to decide is, will it be cheaper to make the\r\nslopes sufficiently flat so that they can be left unprotected, or is it\r\npreferable to have a steep inclination, such as 1½ to 1, and to\r\ncarefully cover and protect the surfaces, the probable cost of\r\nmaintenance of the protecting cover being duly considered?\r\n\r\nAs a rule in homogeneous earth, such as clay, underground excavation is\r\nthe most free from water, and therefore from slips; but the enormous\r\nforce clay possesses upon swelling—and this disturbance of the soil may\r\noccur many times by the action of air and moisture—and its contraction\r\nupon drying, cause tunnels in clay to be risky undertakings. The chief\r\nprecautions against failure are to allow plenty of space for the\r\nexpansion of the clay, reduce the uncovered lengths to the least\r\ndimensions, have dry, yet hard and compressible, filling between the\r\narch and the walls and the clay, use the strongest bricks, or material\r\nwith great compressive strength for the lining, adopt a form giving as\r\nequal support as possible in every direction, _i.e._, one closely\r\napproaching the circular, leave plenty of weep-holes to prevent any\r\naccumulation of water, and thoroughly drain and gently conduct to the\r\nproper drainage channels all water as it exudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  THE GENERAL EFFECT OF A SLIP IN A CUTTING OR AN\r\n    EMBANKMENT.—ENUMERATION AND CONSIDERATION OF SOME PROTECTIVE AND\r\n    REMEDIAL WORKS.—TREATMENT OF THE SLIPPED EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the effect of a slip the chief consideration is, will it\r\nbe dangerous and prevent traffic or the unrestrained use of the work? A\r\nproblem most difficult to solve. Upon railways experience seems to show\r\nthat slips of earthwork in cuttings of a depth exceeding about 10 to 15\r\nfeet are more to be feared as likely to interfere and stop the traffic\r\nthan slips in embankments, and particularly as, except on sidelong\r\nground, slips in embankments seldom occur in which the whole of the\r\nformation is moved, or becomes too unstable for a slow train to pass\r\nover, and a temporary road can usually be maintained by timber trestles\r\nand baulks, or other usual means. When a slip happens in a cutting the\r\nfallen earth may cover the formation, and it is certain that it can move\r\nin no other direction. The permanent way may be entirely buried, and it\r\nmay be undesirable to excavate the slipped earth until other remedial\r\nworks have been completed, and therefore the traffic is stopped until\r\nthey are effected. In cuttings of little depth where a 3 or 4 to 1 slope\r\nassumed by a cutting originally excavated to, say, 1½ to 1 slopes, will\r\nnot touch the ballast, the serious consequences of a slip are reduced to\r\na minimum, and may not interfere with the traffic, and can be remedied\r\nby the road-men on the section; but not so in the case of embankments.\r\nConsequently the depth of a cutting or height of an embankment must be\r\nregarded as a governing condition apart from other considerations\r\nhereinafter named.\r\n\r\nThe height or depth at which a slip in an embankment or cutting becomes\r\ndisastrous cannot be ascertained by any rule, but knowledge of the\r\nflattest slope at which any particular earth has remained stable in the\r\nsame state as the embankment or cutting under deliberation, will enable\r\na close approximation to be determined of the point to which a slip in a\r\ncutting is likely to reach, and that to which an embankment will\r\nsubside. For instance, a cutting 15 feet in depth, having originally\r\nslopes of 1½ to 1, can assume practically 2 to 1 slopes without covering\r\nthe rails, and, similarly, a 10-feet cutting, a slightly flatter\r\ninclination than 2 to 1. Taking into consideration that for some little\r\ndepth from the surface a cutting, except in loose or treacherous soil,\r\nwill stand at a steeper slope than 2 to 1, perhaps, on the whole, apart\r\nfrom the formation of proper water-tables, an engineer is not justified\r\nin making expensive provision in cuttings, even in doubtful soil, unless\r\nupon an inclined bed towards the cutting, of a less depth than from 10\r\nto 15 feet, as they can be more economically remedied after they occur,\r\nand meteorological influences have shown the location of the unstable\r\nportion. Nevertheless heavy slips have taken place even in cuttings of\r\nsuch a moderate depth as about 10 feet, particularly in clay earths, and\r\nit has been necessary to entirely suspend the traffic consequent upon a\r\ncontinuous mass of earth of shallow depth moving forward upon an\r\nunguentous stratum slightly inclined towards the formation, and\r\ncompletely blocking up the cutting; but this was an exceptional case.\r\n\r\nThere are many cuttings in all parts of the world under very different\r\nconditions of weather and climate, and in every conceivable variety of\r\nearth, in which nothing has been done to prevent movement, with the\r\nexception, perhaps, of a surface-drain inside the fence and a\r\nwater-table, self-formed or otherwise, near the foot of the slope; and\r\nthere are many cuttings and embankments without any precautionary works.\r\nNevertheless they stand or require but little attention. This fact\r\nnaturally leads to the question: when ought any works to be executed\r\nwith the view of preventing movement in earthwork? Expenditure in\r\nprecautionary and preservative works, where they are not required, and\r\nthe serious consequences of a slip are reduced to a minimum, cannot be\r\ndefended; nor can the absence of such preventive measures in treacherous\r\nearth or soil so placed as to induce instability, and where the effect\r\nof a slip may be temporarily or permanently disastrous, notwithstanding\r\nthat economy in construction has now become the watch-word of\r\nrailway-extension; as then the expense of restoration and maintenance\r\nwill be very considerably increased and far exceed the comparatively\r\nsmall cost of initial protection, for public traffic may be stopped and\r\ninjury caused to life and property.\r\n\r\nThe preceding and the following pages have been written in the hope that\r\nthey may afford some assistance in arriving at a correct decision, with\r\nregard to the necessity of precautionary works, and with the view of\r\ncalling to remembrance many of the principal points to be considered in\r\norder to remedy slips, a matter usually demanding prompt decision. With\r\nrespect to the measures that should be adopted to prevent slips, and the\r\nworks required when they have occurred, it would be a mistake to\r\ngeneralize from any successful application of one method of reparation,\r\nas it is necessary to consider each soil separately, and to discover the\r\nreason of a slip; for an attempt to arrest the forward movement of a\r\nlarge mass will be futile; the disturbing cause must be ascertained and\r\nremoved, or so lessened and controlled as to obviate further motion or\r\ndeterioration; sand or porous strata, which may emit water uniformly,\r\nmust be treated differently to earth which sets free water in a\r\nparticular place, as also the same soil if it should be in a dissimilar\r\ncondition. The object of all such works is to support, maintain, and\r\ndrain the earth and prevent any accumulation of water in the slopes and\r\nformation, so that movement is improbable; therefore, water flowing\r\ntowards the slopes must be intercepted and led away before it has time\r\nto percolate; and the method of discharging it must be governed by the\r\nposition and nature of the soil, the chief aim of draining operations\r\nbeing to cause the earth to be always in its most consolidated\r\ncondition. Without obstruction to the drainage, a general preservative\r\nis to cover the surface, and protect it against the deleterious effects\r\nof rain, frost and thaw, particularly in the case of soils which\r\ndisintegrate rapidly under the influence of weather.\r\n\r\nSome of the means that can be adopted to prevent slips and subsidences\r\nin cuttings and embankments may be enumerated as follows.\r\n\r\n1. Systematic drainage of a cutting, and the natural ground and\r\ndeposited earth in an embankment, so as to augment its weight sustaining\r\npower and general stability.\r\n\r\n2. A side ditch near to the foot of each slope, and at the top of the\r\nslope adjacent to the fence line.\r\n\r\n3. Catchwater drains upon the slopes.\r\n\r\n4. Wells, filled with broken filtering material, contiguous to the fence\r\nline and connecting drains with them.\r\n\r\n5. Open timber trenches, strutted at intervals, and acting as drains and\r\ncounterforts, at the toe of a slope.\r\n\r\n6. A channel for the discharge of any water issuing from an intercepted\r\nfield drain.\r\n\r\n7. Tapping springs in the slopes or formation of a cutting, or that\r\nexist in the ground upon which an embankment has to be deposited.\r\n\r\n8. The profile of the formation being made higher in the centre, so that\r\nwater will flow into the side drains or water-table and not remain, due\r\nprovision being made for its discharge.\r\n\r\n9. Side drains being made before the excavation is commenced or\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\n10. No accumulation of water being allowed upon the ground upon which an\r\nembankment has to be deposited.\r\n\r\n11. Covering a slope with rammed earth, burnt ballast, chalk, gravel,\r\nashes, or other protective material.\r\n\r\n12. Turfing a slope, or sowing it with grass seed.\r\n\r\n13. Depositing layers of material, consolidated by ramming or otherwise,\r\nupon a slope at right angles or diagonally to the line of the foot of a\r\nslope.\r\n\r\n14. By benching, or a terrace or cess upon a slope.\r\n\r\n15. Covering the toe of a slope with stone pitching.\r\n\r\n16. Dividing a slope by trenches filled with stones or absorbent\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n17. Weighting a slope to counteract the pressure of the internal water,\r\nand to restore the equilibrium.\r\n\r\n18. A breast-high retaining wall at the toe of a slope.\r\n\r\n19. Covering part or the whole of a slope with fascine mattresses or\r\nbrushwood, systematically laid in combination with gravel, stone, broken\r\nbricks, ashes, &c.\r\n\r\n20. Counterforts of gravel, chalk, burnt ballast, ashes, rubble, &c., at\r\nthe toe and upon a slope.\r\n\r\n21. A dry wall at the toe of the slope of a stratum of unstable soil,\r\nfound above the formation level and superimposed upon rock or firm\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n22. Varying or increasing the flatness of a slope towards the bottom of\r\na cutting or embankment.\r\n\r\n23. In cuttings, by retaining walls, with or without overhead struts.\r\n\r\n24. Systematic planting upon the cess and slopes, trees, shrubs, or\r\nbushes having deep wide-spreading roots.\r\n\r\n25. The removal of any spoil bank that may have been tipped or cast out\r\nnear the top of the slope of a cutting.\r\n\r\n26. Removing the turf and all loose or decaying matter from the natural\r\nground before the earth is deposited.\r\n\r\n27. Clearing away all snow and frozen soil before tipping or excavating,\r\nand taking care that no frozen earth is deposited.\r\n\r\n28. Forming the ground upon which an embankment has to be tipped, at an\r\ninclination downward from the toe of a slope, towards the centre, and\r\nthe construction of a dry drain along the centre line so as to cause\r\npercolating water to flow away, or prevent it reaching the slopes.\r\n\r\n29. Benching the ground upon which an embankment has to be deposited.\r\n\r\n30. Covering the ground upon which an embankment is to be tipped with a\r\nhard permeable layer.\r\n\r\n31. Trenches filled with stones or other hard permeable material across\r\nthe base of an embankment.\r\n\r\n32. Covering the toe of the slope of an embankment with sods or making a\r\ncounterfort of turf.\r\n\r\n33. Running to spoil all saturated earth, and suspending operations for\r\na day or two after heavy and continuous rain or a fall of snow, or\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n34. Filling any large fissures as they appear.\r\n\r\n35. Weighting the earth so as to condense it.\r\n\r\n36. Increasing the area of the base of an embankment according to the\r\nbearing power of the soil.\r\n\r\n37. By the exclusion of all boulders, roots, turf, branches of trees, or\r\nbushes in forming an embankment.\r\n\r\n38. By aiding consolidation and preventing separation at the junction of\r\ntwo embankments.\r\n\r\n39. Tipping an embankment in such a way as to promote consolidation.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent chapters many protective and remedial measures are\r\nspecifically named. Here reference is made to the more general\r\nprinciples. The purpose for which a cutting has been excavated, or an\r\nembankment deposited must be taken into consideration in providing\r\nprotective works, for the surfaces may only be temporarily bared, as in\r\ntrenchwork for walls, or be partly covered with water, as in canals, and\r\nentirely unsubmerged upon one side as in canal, reservoir, and\r\nreclamation embankments; or be fully exposed to meteorological\r\ninfluences as in railway and road cuttings and embankments. There can be\r\nno stereotyped system of operations for treating a slip, but experience\r\nindicates that a frequently successful initiatory method is to divide\r\nthe earth into small portions, and to proceed to equally consolidate\r\nthem. However, in the case of deep cuttings, especially when excavated\r\nin the side of a hill, it may be necessary to drive a heading beneath\r\nthe formation and to connect it with a shaft upon the higher side, so as\r\nto tap the water-bearing soil, and to convey the water away to prevent\r\nit reaching the slopes; this may be considered as a slip requiring an\r\nexceptional remedy. Should a cutting be in moving ground or permeable\r\nsoil of doubtful stability, such a system of wells and covered\r\ngalleries, which are generally successful even in the worst soil, may be\r\nrequired. The wells should, if possible, be sunk a few feet into an\r\nimpermeable stratum, their diameter being the least a man can excavate,\r\nto any size required, and their distance apart, say, from 30 to 60 feet,\r\naccording to the quantity of water to be collected. They should be\r\nconnected by drifts. Smaller intermediate wells can be made between the\r\nmain wells. In order to be effectual such works must be carefully and\r\nuniformly constructed, or an accumulation of water will arise. When a\r\nslip is known to have occurred, simply from want of drainage, a\r\nsufficient remedy may be the removal of the slipped earth and the\r\ninsertion of drains. An advantage of the loose counterfort system of\r\ndrainage as compared with rigid and fixed drains, is that open drains\r\nwill follow a slight subsidence of the earth, and yet maintain their\r\nefficiency, but care must be taken that they do not become choked. In\r\nshifting or doubtful soil all works should be quickly finished, and in\r\nsidelong ground it is best to commence drainage operations on the valley\r\nside so as to tap the water, as if they are begun on the hill-side they\r\nmay, until through drainage is effected, form channels for the\r\naccumulation of water, and cause a slip. The repairs of a slip can be\r\ncommenced at several places simultaneously if at short distances apart,\r\nsuch as 20 feet or so, and, as a rule, it is preferable in an embankment\r\nthat the work proceeds towards the centre, and not from the central\r\nportion to the slopes. It is advisable to make ditches or galleries in\r\nshort lengths, not only to disturb the ground as little as possible, but\r\nalso to ensure perfect supervision, as if the work is not carefully and\r\nuniformly constructed, localization of water will ensue.\r\n\r\nThe extent of a slip will to some extent govern the remedy. Simple open\r\nstone-filled drains, 2 to 4 feet in width, and 1 foot to 2 feet in\r\ndepth, extending from the base to the top, may be sufficient for shallow\r\ncuttings or embankments, such as 10 to 15 feet, and larger and deeper\r\ntrenches above those depths or heights, and complete drainage of and\r\naround the slipped earth, and division of it by means of drains and\r\npipes.\r\n\r\nIn countries where there is an excessive rainfall in a short time, it\r\nhas been found necessary to catch as much of the surface flood waters\r\nand torrential streams as possible, and to reduce their velocity before\r\npassing through an embankment or down a cutting, and to provide a pond\r\nor “tumbling bay” at the base of a waterfall for such purpose, or to\r\nerect dams, when the force is not too great, so as to arrest and lessen\r\nthe velocity of the flow. Without such precautions, flood waters will\r\nerode the earth, and the beds become gradually deeper; and walls at the\r\ntoe, culverts, and dry stone filling across the whole width of an\r\nembankment, and stone covering upon the slopes where water issues or\r\nflows may be required. Catchment reservoirs have also proved of use in\r\ncontrolling the surface waters before they reach a cutting or\r\nembankment, and in permitting them to be controlled.\r\n\r\nMany of the chief causes of slips in embankments are enumerated in\r\nChapter I., &c. Some of the most important operations to prevent slips\r\nin an embankment are to thoroughly drain its seat, prevent a flow upon\r\nthe surface of the original ground, percolation of drainage waters into\r\nits lower part and filtration of rain-water at the crown, and to\r\ngenerally protect the surface.\r\n\r\nThe stability of an embankment is not regulated by the cohesiveness of\r\nthe soil, as a sand or gravel embankment, or that formed of any material\r\nwhose particles are not deleteriously affected, will stand with a\r\nsufficiently flat slope if protected against erosion, and be more stable\r\nthan a clay or any embankment in which the particles are soluble and\r\nsoon impaired by water, however great their original tenacity. If any\r\npart of an embankment has become saturated, the internal water must be\r\ntapped and drained; as the lower surface portion is almost certain to be\r\nthe wetter, the drains should be made at the base, trenches filled with\r\nopen porous material upon the slopes, and, perhaps, it may be necessary\r\nto sink a few shallow wells. The slopes and formation should be covered\r\nso that when the excess of moisture is extracted from the mass it cannot\r\nbe replaced. Porous earth counterforts can be adopted, 6 to 10 feet in\r\nwidth, placed at intervals depending upon the nature and condition of\r\nthe soil and height of an embankment, or a continuous bank of similar\r\nmaterial at the toe to support the embankment during the temporary\r\nweakening from drainage operations. One of the worst cases that may have\r\nto be treated in embankments is in clay or marl soils, when the central\r\nportion has been first tipped in a wet state in the winter months, and\r\nafter an interval the embankment completed to its required width in a\r\nfrozen condition, or nearly so, or one in which the earth becomes frozen\r\nwhen deposited.\r\n\r\nIn Russia it has been found that rain-water percolating into such an\r\nembankment cannot drain away, but accumulates and finally bursts the\r\nslopes, and that water will exude from frozen soil when it thaws, a\r\nconsiderable time elapsing before all the frozen earth has thawed; water\r\nis thus, as it were, taken into the mass, which in all retentive soils\r\nwill be difficult to drain without turning over the earth; and it will\r\ncause slimy surfaces and general instability. It will always be an\r\nexpensive operation to make such an embankment secure, and it cannot be\r\nmade as firm as one properly deposited. After subsidence has ceased, an\r\napproved remedy in such a case is to cover the formation with an\r\nimpermeable layer, and to raise the embankment to the rail level with\r\nsand, which is ultimately alone used for repairs, the slopes being\r\ncarefully trimmed and sown.\r\n\r\nAlthough not considered in the usual acceptation of the word as a slip,\r\nthe trickling of the surface soil is mentioned as it is a movement which\r\nmay, if allowed to proceed, cause a slip, and frequently necessitates\r\nattention because of the soil becoming in a liquid condition and flowing\r\nupon land beyond that acquired for any works, and also because it\r\nobstructs and chokes drains. It may be expected when a thaw occurs after\r\nsevere frost, or heavy rain succeeds drought, or subsequent to a rapid\r\nchange of weather in any earth of a clayey or calcareous nature, as, for\r\ninstance, in clay marl and argillaceous chalk cuttings or embankments,\r\nand if the configuration of the ground should be favourable to its\r\npassage to land outside that purchased, such issue must be prevented by\r\nprotecting the slopes by means of a covering, by draining, or by the\r\nconsolidation of the surface of the earth, which latter operation may be\r\ndifficult, or by the erection of a small mound near the fence line.\r\n\r\nIn ground containing salt or other solvents in appreciable quantity,\r\ncare should be taken that water does not reach it; if it should, the\r\nsoil immediately becomes damaged and subsides; also it is found that the\r\nearth from which soda nitrate is manufactured in North Chili must be\r\nkept perfectly dry to be secure as a foundation. All soils of a\r\nsalifiable character should be considered as likely to subside and slip.\r\n\r\nIn the salt-producing districts in England it is found that when the\r\nbrine, which is about 25 per cent. of the mass, is pumped up to the\r\nsurface to be made into white salt, the land will subside, as in effect\r\nit is pumping up the underground supporting stratum or rock salt bed;\r\nand when a river is contiguous or copious springs, the rock-salt will be\r\nsupplied with water to make it brine. The experience of those who have\r\nhad to maintain embankments in these districts indicates that so long as\r\nsubsidence is uniform embankments can be raised and maintained; but when\r\nwater penetrates into an old pit previously comparatively dry, unequal\r\nand dangerous slips and subsidences may be expected, and on so large a\r\nscale as to require much expenditure for restoration. If the settlement\r\nis uniform, the easiest way is to simply raise an embankment; the rate\r\nof sinking varies considerably, averaging, say, from 2 to 5 feet per\r\nannum, and depending upon the amount of brine extracted and the\r\npercolation of water, &c. It is obvious that embankments upon such land\r\nrequire constant attention to prevent serious slips.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of a cliff or hill where loose rock exists and is joined by\r\nclayey soil, but is sufficiently stable not to slip in a mass, it may be\r\nnecessary to have a cover shed over a railway or road to prevent\r\ndetached pieces of rock falling upon the surface, the slopes from being\r\ninjured, and larger masses sloping down. Covering a slope in such a case\r\nis useless, but an open deep trench, specially constructed to catch\r\npieces of rock, may suffice.\r\n\r\nImportant questions to determine when a slip has occurred are:—\r\n\r\n1. Should the whole or part of the earth that has slipped be removed?\r\n\r\n2. How are the voids to be filled that have been caused by the slip?\r\n\r\n3. Can the disturbed material be again used?\r\n\r\n4. What protective measures should be adopted?\r\n\r\nA thorough examination of the site of a slip and the slipped earth is\r\nabsolutely necessary before the most effectual and economical means of\r\nrestoration can be determined, for weakness or the presence of a\r\ndisturbing agent in the upper or lower portion of a cutting or\r\nembankment may be the cause of movement. An embankment may be solid in\r\nthe mass and only portions may slip and subside, but then may become\r\nunstable and require different treatment, or local restoration may alone\r\nbe necessary, and the slipped earth to be removed be small in quantity.\r\nExtensive slips of the whole of an embankment usually occur from springs\r\nin its seat or the existence of a flow of water upon the ground under\r\nthe base, producing a greasy surface. Should it happen that an\r\nembankment of pervious soil is tipped upon impervious ground having a\r\ndepression resembling a basin, water will accumulate until it reaches\r\nthe level of discharge, and a serious slip may result. In such a case\r\nthe slipped earth must be removed and the water tapped and permanently\r\ndrained. The upper portion of an embankment may slip and the lower be\r\nstable; if so, it is not so serious as when movement commences at the\r\ntoe and the slope bulges outwards and the embankment subsides; in the\r\nformer case, provided the lower portion is not affected or its drainage\r\nobstructed, it may not be necessary to remove the slipped earth, but it\r\nis advisable to drain it, and any localization or lodgment of water\r\nbetween the slipped mass and the firm part of an embankment must be\r\nprevented, or the toe of the slope will be made in an unstable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIn cuttings in order to keep open the formation the whole of the slipped\r\nearth may have to be excavated, but in embankments, so long as the soil\r\ndoes not extend outside the fencing, its entire removal becomes\r\noptional, and is unnecessary provided further movement be prevented, and\r\nthe soil drained; but in most treacherous earths, although a slip may be\r\narrested, it will generally be a place requiring constant watching, and\r\nbe one of doubtful stability. Earthwork slips require to be remedied as\r\nsoon as possible after they occur, not only to repair them and obviate\r\nan interruption of traffic, but in order that the unslipped portions may\r\nnot be deleteriously affected and movement be induced.\r\n\r\nWhen the earth is very soft, silty, and difficult to drain, the only\r\ncourse may be to remove the slipped material, although it may not be\r\nnecessary to excavate all of it, as it may form a reservoir for the\r\naccumulation of water, and is certain to be liable to disturbance from\r\nthe effects of weather; but in firmer soil a portion of the slipped\r\nearth may be excavated, and be rammed in layers inclining at right\r\nangles, or nearly so, to the surface of the slope, and a drain can be\r\ninserted at about the bottom of the line of the slip to prevent any\r\nwater that may percolate from the unslipped mass flowing into the rammed\r\nearth or any counterfort so constructed; but counterforts may afford\r\ninsufficient support in very treacherous soil, and it may be necessary\r\nto remove either the whole or a considerable part of a slope and replace\r\nit with the best available material watered and rammed: however, the\r\nsimple ramming of the earth and depositing it in inclined layers may not\r\nbe sufficient to ensure stability, and should it be found that the\r\nslipped material is very soft and cannot be readily drained, it must be\r\nexcavated, and solid and firm earth put in its place.\r\n\r\nWhen the base of a slip is level with the bottom of any side ditch that\r\nmay have existed before movement occurred, the drain should be below the\r\nlevel of the ditch, or a flow of water may be induced at the seat which\r\nwill probably cause further unsettlement; and if a slip extends below\r\nthe bottom of a cutting it is necessary to remove the slipped earth as\r\nfar as the solid ground, and to fill the void with dry material of\r\nsufficient weight to prevent the surface being uplifted, and to cause\r\nsolidity in order to avoid any movement of the toe of a slope.\r\n\r\nWhen the slipped soil is clay or shale it can be burnt _in situ_ down to\r\nthe solid ground, or upon an incombustible bed, and be converted into a\r\nkind of brick rubbish and then be restored to its original place; but\r\nthis may be an expensive method, and it may be cheaper to procure firm\r\nearth, nevertheless, should no other material be available it may be the\r\nonly economical means of repairing a slip. Before deciding whether clay\r\nor shale shall be burned _in situ_ it may be advisable to test the\r\namount of ballast that can be made by, say, 1 ton or more of coal, and\r\nthe cost including every item of expenditure: 10 or 12 cubic yards of\r\nballast may be obtained for every ton of coal burnt, but this quantity\r\nmay be so reduced that the cost of burning may prohibit the use of such\r\na method for replacing the slipped earth when made into firm soil. It\r\nmuch depends upon the quantity of water in the material, and also upon\r\nthe nature of the earth; for instance, burning becomes more difficult as\r\nthe amount of silica in the clay becomes greater, and the ballast is not\r\nso good as the quantity of lime increases in the clay; therefore pure\r\nclay makes the best burnt ballast. Should it be decided to burn the\r\nslipped earth, it is necessary that it be placed upon firm ground, and\r\nthat it rests upon an open layer of stone or material that will not\r\nkindle in order to obtain the necessary draught. The thickness of the\r\nlayers must be regulated by the degree of wetness of the soil, from 1 to\r\n2 feet being required for thorough burning, and should layers of a less\r\nthickness than 1 foot be required, the process of making the slipped\r\nearth into burnt ballast will usually be too expensive, but of course\r\nmuch depends upon the price of the coal upon the site. The burnt ballast\r\nmay cost anything from 1_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ a cubic yard; when the\r\nlatter price is reached, it may be cheaper to procure sound earth. If\r\nthe slipped earth approaches the condition of carbonaceous shale, black\r\nor dark brown in colour, it may kindle easily; the more argillaceous\r\nshales will require a little coal to convert them to burnt ballast, the\r\nquantity increasing as they gradually become of a clayey character. Blue\r\nclay, when thoroughly burnt, generally makes better ballast than most\r\nother clays, but as a drain the ballast is not equal to clean gravel.\r\n\r\nIn considering whether it is only necessary to simply replace the dried\r\nearth in its original position, it should be determined whether the\r\nundisturbed portion of an embankment will support the weight when\r\nunaided by counterforts with a foundation in solid ground at the toe of\r\nthe slope, trenches and drains upon the slopes, and perhaps a rough\r\nstone bed below the seat of the slip acting as an open drain over part\r\nor the whole of it. In any case provision must be made that there is no\r\nlocalization of water between the original embankment and the filling or\r\nthe counterfort. In some soils, particularly those having seams of sand\r\nor silt, the slipped earth frequently becomes displaced in layers, and\r\nif allowed to remain, each bed will form a water seam upon which any\r\nstratum can slide, and then the earth may not be at rest until the slope\r\nis very flat. The removal of the whole mass is the cheapest remedy. The\r\nsurface left bare by the slipped earth should be trimmed, and all\r\nfissures in it be filled so as to prevent any accumulation or lodgment\r\nof water, but the slipped earth should only be excavated in short\r\nlengths, as it may render support and keep part of the face covered, and\r\nit should be remembered that although the upper portion of the fallen\r\nearth may be the drier it may not be the most stable.\r\n\r\nThe system of removing the slipped earth, erecting rough rubble walls at\r\nintervals of 20 to 30 feet projecting as far as the face of the original\r\nslope, and then filling the intervening space with the material that has\r\nslipped, when turned over and punned, has been successfully adopted. It\r\nis advisable to cover with turf the replaced earth in the slope, unless\r\nsome other protection is supplied. When any signs of movement afterwards\r\ntake place a few additional counterforts, which, may also be made to act\r\nas drains, will generally restore the equilibrium. This system relies\r\nupon preventing movement in earth by separating the masses of the\r\nslipped soil, and draining and supporting them in detail. The\r\nfoundations of the counterforts must be in the solid ground and not\r\nmerely below the seat of the slip. It may be impossible to drain the\r\nsite of a slip or the soil that has moved without dividing it into\r\nportions, the chief object being to thoroughly drain the site and the\r\nslipped earth, so that it is practically encircled with drains and any\r\nwater prevented from collecting in or upon it.\r\n\r\nWhen the land is of little value and a cutting is in a mountain or\r\nhill-side, it may be advisable to assist an extensive slip, provided it\r\nhappens before any public works are opened for traffic; and to remove\r\nthe earth by loosening it by the action of a stream of water until it\r\nslides away, as draining or supporting it may be insufficient. Under\r\nsuch circumstances it is the best course to adopt, especially if a\r\nstream of water can be readily diverted to it as the unstable soil is\r\nfinally disengaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  NOTES ON THE PERCOLATION OF WATER.—SYSTEMS OF DRAINAGE OF CUTTINGS AND\r\n    EMBANKMENTS IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF EARTH AND UNDER DIVERSE\r\n    CONDITIONS.—THE CONSTRUCTION OF CULVERTS, PIPE-DRAINS, TRENCHES,\r\n    DITCHES, AND CATCHWATER DRAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the percolation and drainage of water in cuttings and\r\nembankments, in cuttings the chief consideration is to gently extract\r\nand conduct the water so as to avoid any accumulation or localised flow\r\nbeneath the original surface of the ground in order to prevent the\r\nsurface water eroding the slopes or collecting or forming a course,\r\nsaturating the ground outside them, and to ensure that the earth is not\r\nmore charged with water than when in its normal condition; for, as soon\r\nas the state of absorption has reached that of dissolving or separating\r\nthe particles, however fine, aqueous action is likely to produce slips,\r\nand a flow of water or vibration will supply the disturbing force\r\nnecessary to commence a movement. In embankments one of the chief\r\nprecautions is to obviate any flow of water upon or at a few feet\r\nbeneath the land upon which an embankment has to be deposited, as it\r\nwill disturb the feet of the slopes and the base, reduce the adhesion to\r\nand the friction of the tipped earth upon the ground and form a sliding\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nAn accumulation of water upon the formation must be prevented, and, as\r\nin the majority of cases a railway or road is not level, any collection\r\nof water at the commencement of an incline or at a change of gradient\r\nshould be provided against, and especially any localisation of flow down\r\nthe slopes from the formation; the main point being to keep a cutting or\r\nembankment in a uniform state so that settlement is equable. By\r\ncarefully watching the effect of heavy rain upon the slopes and the\r\nformation, the places where water amasses can be traced, and means used\r\nto restore the surface to the same condition as the other portions of a\r\ncutting or embankment. As water is the chief cause of slips, the\r\nfriction and cohesion of earth being impaired and, perhaps, destroyed by\r\nit, it is obvious that at the time percolation, which varies greatly\r\nwith the seasons, is at its maximum, _i.e._ when the earth becomes in a\r\ndamp or wet state, slips are to be most expected, and particularly soon\r\nafter the commencement of the wet season. It is known that upon the\r\nthawing of a heavy fall of snow, and of quickly succeeding and separate\r\nfalls of snow, percolation is great; also after heavy and continuous\r\nrains, especially if the strata dip towards a river, and in the case of\r\nsprings whose yield depends more upon percolation than the amount of\r\nrainfall, a wet winter will cause an increased flow some time after,\r\nwhen the earth may become saturated.\r\n\r\nIf it could be determined at what depth in any earth in any state\r\npercolation, evaporation, and meteorological influences would cease, and\r\nalso their effects, rules could be deduced for guidance in draining\r\ncuttings and embankments. The manner of the execution of ordinary\r\ncuttings and embankments is so dissimilar to that of filter-beds of\r\nwaterworks, that the experiments made for such purposes are only of\r\ncomparative value for the former works, for the condition as well as the\r\ncharacter of the soil affects its permeability by water. For instance,\r\nin cuttings, with the exception of some surface disturbance during the\r\nprocess of excavation, the removal of vegetation or a covering, and the\r\nexposure of the ground to the atmosphere, &c., the normal state of the\r\nearth is not much altered; but in embankments different soils may be\r\nintermingled in a manner almost unknown in nature, the varieties of\r\nmixtures of earth being most numerous, and they may be in every\r\ncondition of compactness, dryness, and dampness amounting almost to\r\nsaturation, and in any case, therefore, percolation is temporarily or\r\npermanently increased consequent upon the earth having been disturbed\r\nand loosened.\r\n\r\nThe general principles of the percolation of water are here only briefly\r\nreferred to, as they particularly concern slips in earthwork: but\r\nobviously the quantity of percolated water greatly affects the stability\r\nof a slope, for the surface water should not be guidelessly allowed to\r\nsoak into or be absorbed by the ground at the top, and so proceed\r\nthrough and down the slopes, as then the pent-up water tends to press\r\nout the face which may be temporarily sun-dried. As in excavating\r\ncuttings the surface is bared and vegetation removed from the soil,\r\nwater has easier access, and unless the ground when excavated is\r\nimmediately covered as before, its normal state is not preserved. One\r\npoint of considerable importance is to ascertain whether in any cutting\r\nor embankment percolation is uniform and regular; some infiltration will\r\nnecessarily take place, as water will gravitate from the top to the\r\nbottom and will find the easiest course or line of least resistance,\r\nwhich may not be at the lowest level.\r\n\r\nAs the amount of the annual rainfall varies greatly according to the\r\ncountry, and, even in England, considerably in a small area, the earth\r\nwill be more affected in one place than another; for instance, 48 to 50\r\ninches is approximately the annual average rainfall upon the extreme\r\nS.S.W. coast of England, being greatest at the highest level nearest the\r\nsea and to leeward; it diminishes gradually from W. to E. to from 26 to\r\n24 inches, the minimum of about 20 inches being in Essex. The\r\ndifferences of quantity must therefore be regarded; but such rainfall is\r\nas nothing compared with that of tropical lands, for the fall often\r\ncontinues many hours, and yet equals and perhaps exceeds an inch per\r\nhour. The heaviest fall and its usual time of appearance should be\r\nascertained, as earthworks may have to be constructed in a peculiar\r\ndistrict where the rainfall may be more than double that of the average\r\nwettest district, and it will often be much greater at the foot or the\r\ntop of neighbouring hills than on a flat coast. Local information from\r\nreliable sources is the best guide when confirmed by general knowledge.\r\nIn the tropics 100 to 200 inches in depth of rain instead of 20 to 30\r\ninches has to be treated, and frequently half the total annual rainfall\r\nin England comes down in twenty-four hours. It is almost superfluous to\r\nname that the protective works which would be amply sufficient in one\r\ncountry may be useless in another, simply because of the variation in\r\nthe amount of the rainfall and the capacity of different earths to\r\nresist or invite the percolation of water.\r\n\r\nObviously percolation will vary considerably with the seasons, and a\r\nsuccession of wet periods or a continuous downpour will increase the\r\nquantity of infiltrating water; but the effect of a fall may not be\r\nexperienced until some time after it occurs, as in districts or rivers\r\nthat are fed with water from the thawing of snow upon surrounding or\r\ndistant hills water reaches the lower tracts of country in hot and\r\nsunny, and therefore generally dry weather, when evaporation is the\r\ngreatest, and not in winter. Again, there is generally very little\r\nrainfall over flat deserts, but an excess upon mountain ranges which may\r\nsurround a desert, and especially in tropical countries experience has\r\nproved that storms and rainfall are often local and extend over a small\r\narea, one district being more liable to such a visitation than another;\r\nthey are also, as usual, of irregular duration and severity.\r\n\r\nThe position of a river may also affect the percolation of water more\r\nupon one side of a valley than another, for a river seldom has its\r\ncourse in the centre of a vale, but is generally nearest to the steeper\r\nand higher side of a hill. The configuration of a country governs to a\r\ngreat extent the flow and quantity of the rainfall that sinks into the\r\nearth, as in a hilly country and in impervious soil the water is quickly\r\ndischarged into an adjacent river, taking the easiest course. In a flat\r\ncountry and pervious soil rain percolates the earth and saturates the\r\nground, or reappears in springs.\r\n\r\nAs by drainage the retentive power of the soil is not allowed free\r\noperation, water rapidly flows into the drains instead of being chiefly\r\nheld by the earth and watercourses, and channels are sometimes created;\r\nand where the rainfall is heavy or occurs in a comparatively short time\r\nfloods may be caused, although the soil when drained, and therefore in a\r\ndrier state, absorbs more water than when undrained and in a damp\r\ncondition, water will pass through it quicker, and the discharge is thus\r\nincreased in volume and velocity.\r\n\r\nEarth may be in a damp state, either from mere surface percolation and\r\naccumulation of water, or from springs which may never cease to flow; on\r\nthe contrary, in rainless districts, from the almost perpetual daily\r\ndrying power of the sun, the earth is sometimes found to be firmest and\r\nhardest upon the top, and for a few feet below it, than at greater\r\ndepths. Separate masses of vegetation usually indicate damp places in a\r\nbare country.\r\n\r\nAs rain flows more quickly from non-absorbent soil, such as rock, and\r\nslowly permeable earth, as the clays, than from porous soil, the surface\r\ndischarge is greater; and unless the water is guided, pools are likely\r\nto be formed and weak places created, especially if the ground dips\r\ntowards a cutting. It is well to remember that a cutting being excavated\r\nupon the side of a hill or upon table-land may change the direction of\r\nthe flow of the drainage waters, and an embankment may obstruct and\r\ninterfere with them, and should the strata incline towards the\r\nexcavation, it obviously favours a discharge of water into it.\r\n\r\nIf water permeates the soil or trickles down through fissures or veins,\r\nit will continue to do so until an impervious layer is reached, when it\r\nwill be deflected and may become a current; therefore, whenever a\r\npermeable stratum overlies an impermeable, and the impermeable earth\r\ninclines, an increased flow may be expected, as also near the junction\r\nof tributary waters with streams or rivers.\r\n\r\nIn a drained district, water will not usually be encountered in large\r\nquantities until a depth is reached below the level of general drainage,\r\n_i.e._, about the invert of the nearest drains or sewers, especially in\r\nporous soils, but in the case of a pervious subsoil, such as sand or\r\ngravel, or if the tides rise in an adjacent river or the sea to the\r\nlevel of any foundations or above it, more water may percolate over the\r\nsite or drainage area than has time to flow away between tides, the\r\nwater will then rise, and systematic pumping becomes a necessity, unless\r\nthe volume of the ingressing waters can be sufficiently reduced by the\r\ndeposition of an impervious layer upon or in the river-bed or sea-shore,\r\nor by sheet-piling or other means, or the flow confined, which may be a\r\nrisky operation in loose soil, depending upon its resistance to scour.\r\n\r\nIn clay soils, so far as slips are concerned, the action especially to\r\nbe feared is the trickling of water down fissures which may extend to\r\ndepths below the bottom in cuttings and create slimy surfaces,\r\ndisconnecting masses of earth, and finally offering a ready means of\r\nmovement, which swelling of the clay or vibration may complete. The\r\nexperiments of Mr. Baldwin Latham, M. Inst. C.E., on the absorption and\r\nretention of water by clay soils, gave the following results:—The\r\nstiffest clays retained the greatest quantity of water. Clay soils can\r\nabsorb and retain from 40 to 60 per cent. of water by weight. Marly\r\nclays hold less water than the pure clays. In the case of loamy soils,\r\nthe percentage of water retained varied from 35 to 60 per cent. by\r\nweight, the mixture of sand and clay, therefore, limited the amount of\r\nwater which it would naturally hold.\r\n\r\nAs in chalk soils fissures occur, the percolation of water and the\r\neffects of the atmosphere through the pores causes movement, and even\r\ncrevices and breaks in rocks are not to be disregarded with impunity, as\r\nthey are channels of disintegration.\r\n\r\nMost earths when dry attract water, but if they are regularly irrigated,\r\nthey require less moisture, depending upon the nature of the earth, and\r\nslope and relative level of the land. All soils when broken, as in\r\nembankments, absorb more water than when in an unbroken state, as in\r\ncuttings; for instance, it has been found by experiment that clayey and\r\nretentive earths will absorb about 7 per cent. more water, and light\r\nporous soils about 6 per centum. Of course, the increment varies. Even\r\nwet retentive soil, if handled, becomes considerably less impervious to\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nMr. Evans, F.R.S., has proved by experiment that percolation through\r\npure chalk is much greater than through ordinary top soil consisting of\r\ngravel, loam, and mould, both being covered with turf, and that in\r\nwinter the average proportions of percolation are as about 1 for soil to\r\n1·5 for chalk; in summer 1 for soil to 2·6 for chalk. The depth also to\r\nwhich chalk will allow a passage of water is some 60 per cent. more than\r\nordinary top soil.\r\n\r\nRain will percolate through chalk or any open soil until it meets an\r\nimpervious stratum, or to that place which is in a state of saturation,\r\nwhen the water must either flow away or the level of saturation must\r\ngradually rise. This causes rivulets to burst out in places after heavy\r\nrain, when the water has had time to percolate, and the rainfall has\r\nexceeded the average, but such springs will cease when the local excess\r\nhas terminated. However, in cuttings it is the flow from fissures that\r\nis to be feared, and their size may indicate the quantity of water that\r\nmay be expected to issue from them. It seems to be generally agreed that\r\nthe supply of water from chalk is derived from rain, which percolates\r\nthrough innumerable fissures, and that in all rocks, whether limestone,\r\nsandstone, granite, sand, or clay, it is by means of the fissures,\r\nseams, and veins that the supply of water is obtained from rain, and\r\nsprings created.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the percolation of water through sand, it may always be\r\nexpected to be very considerable, and the soil may under certain\r\nconditions become water-charged. Mr. Greaves, M. Inst. C.E., has shown\r\nby experiments that the average percolation through ordinary top soil is\r\nonly about one-third of that of sand, but the evaporation from a surface\r\nof ordinary soil was about four times more than from a similar surface\r\nof sand, and also the amount of percolation in ordinary top earth was\r\nsmall on the whole, and, perhaps, the percolation through ordinary\r\nground would be about 25 per cent. of the rainfall, but 80 per cent. in\r\naverage sand.\r\n\r\nExperiments have also shown that the absorbent capacity of sand\r\ndecreases regularly according to the fineness of the grain, and that\r\n“some sandy soils will not absorb more than 20 per cent., but sandy soil\r\ncontaining peat, as moorland, as much as 80 per cent., both computed by\r\nweight.”\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water absorbed by loamy soil will vary considerably\r\naccording as clay or sand preponderates in the mass. Earth may become so\r\nmixed with coarse or fine sand that, when saturated, it approaches the\r\ncondition of a quicksand.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of percolation has been briefly described as follows.\r\nUpon water entering the pores of an earth it displaces the air or liquid\r\npreviously present, forcing the former upwards into the atmosphere, and\r\nthe latter downwards.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly referred to the percolation of water in cuttings and\r\nembankments, the drainage is now considered. It must be either\r\nprecautionary, _i.e._, to prevent a slip, or remedial, _i.e._, to drain\r\na slip.\r\n\r\nThe aim of any draining operations to prevent slips in earthwork is to\r\nsearch for the source of water discharge, to tap and gently conduct it\r\naway and prevent it reaching, accumulating, percolating, or being\r\nconfined within the slope of a cutting, which it may then reduce to a\r\npulpy condition; its free effluxion being most important, as also the\r\nlessening of the percolation of rain and surface-waters. The drainage of\r\ncuttings or embankments may consist of wells, culverts, closed or open\r\nchannels, pipes, and tile drains of every reasonable and economical\r\nform, and may be placed in various positions. To describe them and the\r\ndifferent systems of draining is to open up a subject requiring several\r\nvolumes; here the endeavour is made to indicate whether elaborate or\r\nordinary drainage is required, or mere water-tables and surface drains,\r\nand care in the process of excavation and deposition, protection of the\r\nslopes, and in giving them sufficient inclination to prevent movement.\r\nIf possible and time allows, the drainage in treacherous soils should\r\nalways be commenced before the main excavation, and, in any case,\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nRock and solid impermeable earth may merely require to be surface\r\ndrained, but all treacherous and porous soil, deep draining; and\r\ngranular soils, which usually exude water from the whole mass, demand\r\ndifferent treatment to those earths which discharge water at particular\r\nplaces; but it may be most difficult to drain a mixed soil, such as\r\nsandy loam and silt. With the exception of a counterfort and drain at\r\nthe foot of a slope, and an impermeable catchwater drain upon the slopes\r\nand top drains, to prevent and lessen surface percolation, the best\r\nmethod to adopt in earth of this description may be to sink wells at\r\nintervals to intercept the flow or percolation of any ground waters; to\r\nattempt to drain or draw out the water in the soil will end in\r\ncomparative failure. To reduce the volume of the percolating waters is\r\nthe object to be attained, and then evaporation, vibration, which tends\r\nto shake down water, and time may gradually convert the earth to the\r\ndesired drier condition. The wells can be filled with broken stone or\r\ncoarse gravel to support them, and prevent their closing.\r\n\r\nIt is an advantage to prevent the percolation of water into soil that\r\nwill not readily part with it, such as the clay earths, as it may be\r\neconomically impossible to drain or restore the earth to its normal\r\ncondition, and should the strata be upheaved, intermixed, and of a\r\npermeable and impermeable character, a scientific application of\r\ndrainage can alone succeed. When the source of the water is ascertained,\r\nit can be seen whether a complete system of drainage is necessary over\r\nthe whole of a cutting or only a portion of the slopes. Dampness and the\r\negression of water may be merely local; if so, by boring a hole and\r\ninserting a drain into a slope to tap the flow it may be cured, the\r\nsurface being made dry by a layer of ashes or other absorbent material.\r\nPipes or tile drains may be sufficient when springs exist, or the flow\r\nof water is local, and in loose soils it is especially advisable to\r\nprovide openings for cleaning any covered drains. Brickwork, masonry,\r\nconcrete, pipes, or other rigid drains, may not be suitable for ground\r\nlikely to unequally subside, as they will probably crack or leak, and\r\nloose-jointed pipes or over-lapping tile drains may be required. In\r\ntreacherous clay soils surface longitudinal and transverse drains will\r\nmost probably be insufficient, and deep draining of the mass be\r\nnecessary, also the ground upon which earth is deposited will require to\r\nbe drained and a layer of rubble stone placed upon it, a cutting or\r\nembankment being divided into small drainage areas by deep open dry\r\nstone trenches.\r\n\r\nWater may not sufficiently percolate into a hill, either because of its\r\nsurface being covered with vegetation, or the soil being of an\r\nimpervious nature. It may then flow down the slope of a cutting which\r\nwill probably be bare and unprotected. To prevent slips the discharge\r\nmust be carefully controlled and led away, particularly when the\r\nformation is drift soil upon rock, or the earth will be liable to\r\nsaturation and degradation; also to prevent a flow of water under its\r\nseat, and upon the natural ground, should an embankment be deposited\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nWhen a slope upon the hill-side of a cutting is of considerable length\r\nand steepness, it is advisable to bench it and divide it into a series\r\nof terraces and short slopes, and to provide catchwater drains, with\r\nimpermeable surfaces so as to prevent any surface water attaining a high\r\nvelocity, and scouring power. All surface water upon the side of a hill\r\nshould be controlled, and catchwater drains may suffice to do this.\r\n\r\nShould an impervious stratum be upheaved so as to make a reservoir wall\r\nfor water under the seat of an embankment, it is useless to\r\nsurface-drain the valley side of it in sidelong ground, as it will not\r\naffect the waters that trickle down the hill, which will be dammed up to\r\nthe top level of the impervious stratum, and may saturate the seat of an\r\nembankment and cause a slip. In such a case through drainage must be\r\ncreated from the hill to the valley, and the impervious upheaved cap\r\nmust be pierced so as not to interfere with the passage of water.\r\n\r\nIn countries where there is a certain dry and rainy season, the\r\nnecessary provision required for drainage must not be computed from the\r\nvisible effects of the rainfall soon after the wet season has commenced,\r\nbut the maximum flood may be discerned when the earth has absorbed or\r\nretains the moisture evaporated during the dry season, and becomes\r\nwater-charged. In the tropics or exceptionally wet districts the only\r\neffectual method of draining may be to divide the area into small\r\nportions, as the rainfall may be so great, sudden, and continuous that\r\nunless it naturally flows into a channel, which should not be diverted\r\nor its course be materially altered, it will be impossible to control\r\nthe waters. In an exceptional situation where a railway must be located\r\nin a ravine and close to a river, and the material of which an\r\nembankment is made is compact earth or the ground firm, it may be\r\nadvisable to allow the overflow waters of a river, or the flow of\r\nsurface water towards it, when the extreme flood level is known, to\r\ngently pass over a line of railway, it being kept at such a level as not\r\nto impede free working, and to ensure that any back water is not\r\nprevented from escaping. If not, an embankment may slip and require\r\nextensive and frequent bridges, culverts, or drainage channels in order\r\nto provide sufficient waterway, and to attain permanent stability of the\r\nembankment.\r\n\r\nIn all cases it is necessary to determine the depth to which the drains\r\nmust be placed to be effectual, and their position, extent and number,\r\nand it should be remembered that the fewer there are the greater will be\r\nthe velocity and discharge; also if many small drains are inserted the\r\nsoil may stand, but if only one or two are made the surface may succumb\r\nto the erosive action of the flowing waters. The provision of a\r\nwater-table or the mere surface drainage of a cutting, or the seat of an\r\nembankment may be of little use, as the superimposed soil may slide upon\r\na stratum, and unless this bed is thoroughly drained rain may quickly\r\ndestroy the equilibrium. Of course, in the case of a slip, the drains to\r\nbe effectual must be placed below its level and down to the layer upon\r\nwhich movement has occurred, especially in clay and retentive and\r\nimpervious earths, for instance, surface drainage in yellow clay is\r\nalmost useless.\r\n\r\nShould the source be known from which the water issues the drainage may\r\nbe local, and if a spring be unsealed it may be necessary to insert\r\npipes in the slope, for until the spring is tapped and guided no system\r\nof drains may be effectual.\r\n\r\nBy inserting a stand-pipe over a spring, the height to which the water\r\nwill rise will approximately show the head-level of the supply. If\r\npossible, this should be ascertained, as it may happen that the water\r\ncan be drained by gravitation in pipes without much excavation being\r\nrequired in the slopes or formation; but care should be taken that no\r\nwater is allowed to settle or accumulate for the purpose of its being\r\nconducted away unless upon a protected surface.\r\n\r\nWith regard to catchwater drains upon the cess at the top of the slopes,\r\nthey should be cut before the excavation is commenced; and it is\r\nimportant to remember that instead of their affording protection by\r\nguiding the surface waters, which would otherwise proceed towards the\r\nslopes, they may increase the percolation by localizing the water and\r\nallowing it to accumulate and find its way to the slope; and in sidelong\r\nground it may, therefore, be necessary to protect their valley more than\r\ntheir uphill side, as the surface water will impinge against it; but\r\nwhen they are practically impervious and gently direct the surface water\r\nthey are advantageous, and in permeable soil, unless they are so\r\nconstructed as to be impervious, perhaps it is better to have none. They\r\nshould be as reasonably distant from the top of the slope as is\r\nconvenient without weakening the foundations of the posts supporting any\r\nfencing, and in order to quickly discharge the water and lessen the\r\nchance of their becoming choked by detritus or ice, they should have\r\nconsiderable inclination. As the adoption of even a moderate fall in the\r\ndrains may erode the side ditches and cause water to percolate to the\r\nslopes and make a water-seam, it may be necessary to protect the bottom,\r\nand as the depth of the side drains in order to be effectual may be\r\nconsiderable, according to the character of the soil, the sides may also\r\nrequire to be covered and supported. In cuttings in many soils\r\nsufficient stones can be picked out to cover the surfaces of the side\r\ndrains, and they can be roughly packed, the smaller stones being rammed\r\ninto the interstices between the larger, which will gradually become\r\nfilled; also a covering of brushwood, rammed earth, or puddled clay can\r\nbe used, or other expedient which occasion may suggest. The inclination\r\nmust not be steeper than the natural or protected bed can bear without\r\nthe water scouring it, and yet should be sufficient to prevent any\r\ndeposit or choking, and the drains should be cleared regularly, and\r\nespecially in the autumn in England or before the wet season commences,\r\nand all depressions in which water can accumulate should be levelled in\r\norder to assist easy discharge. Small open drains become choked somewhat\r\neasily, and it is therefore advisable to make them according to the\r\nnature of the soil, situation, and requirements not less than 1 foot 6\r\ninches to 3 feet in width at the top and 1 foot at bottom; they may be\r\nfrom 1 foot to 3 feet in depth. Care should be taken that the bends are\r\nnot too abrupt or the water may make its own course. A gentle curve\r\nconsiderably increases the flow. The angle of a bend should be as easy\r\nas possible, and not exceed 26° or 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nIn sandy and loose soils, if unprotected, open drains may be difficult\r\nto maintain even when filled with broken stone, and covered or pipe\r\ndrains be necessary, and those loosely filled with stones or faggots may\r\nnot succeed; in any case no run of the sand must be allowed, and it is\r\nadvisable to rapidly construct them. In peaty soils, from subsidence of\r\nthe ground consequent upon draining, the drains often become choked. The\r\ndepth of a drain in the formation may require to be deeper than\r\nelsewhere, as at the toe of the slope, the weakest part, the water will\r\ngenerally be most abundant.\r\n\r\nUpon railways, the advantage of thorough drainage of the formation as\r\nregards the stability of the permanent way and reduction of the cost of\r\nrepairs is proverbial, but here is only named in its relation to the\r\nprevention and the reparation of slips.\r\n\r\nWhen field drains are intercepted in the slopes, drain pipes or timber\r\nducts should be joined to them and be connected with the general\r\ndrainage of a cutting. Draining the slopes, providing outlets for the\r\nwater, and also support to the earth can be effected by means of a\r\ncounterfort of permeable material at the toe of the slope, with its\r\nfoundation a few feet below formation level, with open drains at right\r\nangles or obliquely to it extending from the foe to the top of the\r\nslope.[1] These open drains and trenches can be filled with stones,\r\ngravel, hard chalk, ashes, brushwood and gravel, broken bricks, burnt\r\nclay or other suitable material; and a simple covering of picked ashes,\r\n&c., over a moist place in a clay cutting of little depth may be\r\nsufficient. The distance apart of such trenches in clay cuttings\r\ngenerally ranges between 10 and 33 feet; their location must be governed\r\nby the consideration that they exist in order to prevent a localization\r\nof water in the slopes: their width is usually from 2 feet to 8 feet,\r\nand most frequently 4 to 6 feet, and the depth from 1 foot 6 inches to 3\r\nfeet and upwards, below the surface of the slope, but in very wet\r\nembankments a width from 6 to 10 feet and of such a depth as the soil\r\nwill allow without extensive support. If the earth has not slipped, and\r\nit should be found that the ground is wet for from 6 to 8 feet or so\r\nbeneath the surface, and the depth of the trench is made about half that\r\nof the wetted soil, it is sufficient to collect the water, but if it has\r\nslipped most probably such drains will not be effectual until carried\r\ndown below the seat of movement. At the foot of a slope these drains\r\nshould be connected with longitudinal channels parallel to the formation\r\nto gently convey the water to the nearest outlet. The location, distance\r\napart, depth, width, and direction of the trenches must be governed by\r\nthe nature of the soil, the depth of a cutting or height of an\r\nembankment, the area of the surface to be drained, the quantity of water\r\nin it, the presence of water-seams and weak places, and by other minor\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Chap. VI., pp. 111, 112.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the material with which the trenches should be filled, a\r\nuniform substance having considerable power of absorption, and but few\r\nparticles between the interstices, is to be preferred, as the trickling\r\nof water and vibration causes the smaller material to fall towards the\r\nbottom of the trench, which, therefore, may become partly choked, and\r\nfree drainage be interrupted at the toe of the slope, the most\r\nvulnerable place. As sand is always present in unwashed gravel, it will\r\ngradually flow or fall to the base of the trench and will prevent equal\r\ndrainage, but properly burnt clay, being a more uniform and fragmentary\r\nsubstance, is better than sandy gravel, as it is dry and porous; but\r\nmuch depends upon it being well burnt or it may weather. Ashes and chalk\r\nare excellent collectors of water and are usually of an even character,\r\nbut ashes are better than chalk, as the latter material, unless very\r\nhard, is liable to become disintegrated by the action of the atmosphere,\r\nrain, and frost. The difficulty with respect to ashes is to obtain them\r\nin sufficient quantity, free from dust, and of the requisite size. When\r\nweight is required as well as drainage, burnt clay, gravel, or chalk is\r\nto be preferred to ashes. Burnt clay, although burned upon the site, is\r\ngenerally a more expensive material than gravel, but the amount of\r\nmoisture in the clay will principally determine the quantity of fuel\r\nnecessary to burn it, and therefore the cost. If shale is present, by\r\nthoroughly igniting it the expense of burning may be nearly reduced to\r\nthat of lighting and turning over, as it will usually burn unaided. All\r\ntrenches should drain into pipes placed below the formation or into open\r\ndrains at a sufficient distance from the toe of a slope as not to\r\ndeleteriously affect it, in order that the water may be controlled and\r\ngently conveyed to an outlet.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to open drains is that all excavated trenches or\r\ninserted drains in the slopes destroy the cohesion of the earth and aid\r\nin detaching portions of the surface. If the cohesion and adhesion of\r\nthe soil were the same under every condition, this would be a cogent\r\nreason against the system, but, as in earthwork, every degree of\r\nmoisture from dampness to saturation may be attained, the cohesive power\r\nis a very variable quantity, apart from the effects of vibration; and\r\nalso open drains undoubtedly do cause a slope to be drier, and moderate\r\nlocal humidity, and therefore increase the cohesion and general\r\nstability of the part drained; the only fear being that from inattention\r\nthey may become choked; then they are dangerous, as they will\r\npermanently collect and retain water instead of temporarily retaining\r\nand gently guiding it. A careful consideration of the circumstances may\r\nmuch reduce this objection by indicating whether it is advisable to have\r\nonly a few deep, or several small surface drains. Provided proper\r\nprecautions are taken, experience indicates that filled-in trenches in\r\nthe slopes are generally successful, and certainly are simpler and\r\ncheaper than a retaining wall at the toe of a slope. In pervious soil it\r\nmay be economically impossible to drain the slopes unless they are\r\ndivided into sections, and should the material in the trenches be\r\nwell-packed and pressed down, it may even increase the friction between\r\nthe separated portions.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the drainage of cuttings may be named that excavation\r\nshould not be allowed to be cast upon the cess unless some distance from\r\nthe edge of a slope, and only temporarily for purposes of ballasting and\r\nmetalling; as such spoil-banks increase the load and localize the water\r\nto be drained.\r\n\r\nA more complete system of drainage may be necessary than those\r\npreviously named, consisting of a combination of wells, open, or holding\r\nfiltering material; pipe-drains or filled-in trenches, wells with a pipe\r\nleading to a catchwater drain, &c., or other usual methods of land\r\ndrainage. For instance, it may be discovered that water issues from a\r\nspring outside the fence or cutting; if so, in order to drain the slopes\r\nit may be necessary to sink a well to a stratum below the formation\r\nlevel so as to tap the spring, thereby preventing an exudation of water\r\nupon the slope; this is a better plan than drawing the water into the\r\nslope and then draining it.\r\n\r\nWhen pervious earth overlies an impervious stratum, _i.e._, gravel or\r\nsand upon clay, rough-filled wells at intervals inside the fence\r\nextending 3 or 4 feet into the clay, with an outlet drain, may be\r\nrequired to prevent a flow of water upon the clay and a wetted surface\r\nupon which the gravel can slide; and it may be necessary to have a cess\r\non the slope between the top of the clay and the bottom of the gravel or\r\nsand, with a catchwater drain upon it, particularly in a cutting in\r\nsidelong ground.\r\n\r\nShould the soil be silty sand, or be charged with water, consequent upon\r\nthe formation of the country, it may be impossible to drain a cutting\r\nwithout a complete system of wells, catchwater drains and pipes, and\r\neven then it may be difficult to separate the water from the earth. In\r\nbuilding a drain-shaft it should be remembered that it may not only be\r\nsubject to a compressive strain, but also to transverse strain and\r\nflexure from different pressures of the earth at various depths,\r\nespecially when the soil is not the same throughout, and unequally damp.\r\n\r\nWhen “boils” occur in sand-cuttings, perhaps the cheapest expedient is\r\nto place a shaft over the boil, weight the bottom sufficiently to\r\nprevent a movement of the sand, but to allow the water to escape, and\r\nmake a discharge outlet after having ascertained its head level: _vide_\r\nChapter XII. On no account should a spring be stopped, as such action\r\nwill result in its diversion to some other place; but the water flowing\r\nfrom it should be guided and discharged. Weighting may arrest a slip in\r\nany sandy soil, also clay or any impervious material placed upon the\r\nsand, or sinking a well outside a cutting to a depth of some 5 feet\r\nbelow the bottom may effect a remedy by abstracting the surplus water,\r\nbut care must be taken not to disturb the sand.\r\n\r\nSlips in embankments frequently occur from the percolation of water\r\nthrough the formation to the slopes, and so to the toe, the lower\r\nportions become disintegrated by moisture and the effects of weather,\r\nand cause the upper parts to slide or move. To lessen percolation and to\r\nprevent an accumulation of water upon the formation, it is usual for its\r\ncentre to be raised a few inches above the level of the top of the\r\nslope. This is undoubtedly a good practice, as it also tends to drain\r\nthe ballast, but it may be nullified in time if the entire width of the\r\nformation be not covered with an impermeable layer or with ballast; for\r\nwhen an unprotected space remains between the toe of the slope of the\r\nballast and the top of the slope of an embankment, water is liable to\r\npercolate through the cess and cause a slope to become wet and unstable;\r\nparticularly so if the ballast is broken rock and has side walls instead\r\nof slopes, as then a depression will probably be made by the platelayers\r\nor signalmen walking upon the cess. In all cases where the material is\r\ntreacherous or likely to slip, it is advisable to cover the top of\r\nembankments of considerable height throughout their width with ballast\r\nor some impervious soil, provided the permanent way is also properly\r\ndrained. This is the simplest precaution to take respecting the\r\npreservation of the formation level or summit of an embankment. All\r\ngrass, dirt, and refuse should be regularly removed from it and anything\r\nthat obstructs free drainage. The nature of the ballast also affects the\r\nevenness of the surface of the formation, as if it consists of broken\r\nrock, the equal and regular packing of the sleepers is not so easily\r\neffected as with gravel ballast; the sleepers are frequently not\r\nuniformly supported throughout their length, the pressure upon the\r\nformation is localized, depressions are formed and water collected, and\r\nslips and subsidences in soils of a treacherous nature may be induced\r\nfrom this cause, as the equilibrium is soon disturbed. The formation\r\nshould be so drained and constructed that water cannot percolate to or\r\ncause the surface to become soft and work up into or through the\r\nballast, or a state of unsettlement will be produced by water soaking\r\nthrough the ballast to an embankment, and so saturating part of it and\r\nforcing out the upper portion of a slope. In all close granular ballast\r\ncross channels should be made to lead away the surface water. Transverse\r\nopen tile-drains may be required leading to an impervious channel. Water\r\nhas been known to percolate through a considerable depth of ballast when\r\nadded to restore a sunken embankment, even through as much as 7 to 10\r\nfeet when two falling gradients induced a flow of the surface waters to\r\none place. In certain situations it may be necessary should an\r\nembankment be of clay or treacherous soil when wet, to cover the\r\nformation with an impervious stratum to prevent percolation to the\r\nembankment, and to thoroughly and separately drain the ballast placed\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nAt the base of an embankment a ditch should be cut upon the higher side,\r\nor both sides, as near as convenient to the fence. When in addition to\r\nthe interception of any surface waters by an embankment the ground is\r\nvery retentive of moisture, it may be necessary to drain the seat; with\r\nthis object trenches can be excavated at intervals at right angles or\r\nobliquely to the centre line of the embankment, and be filled with some\r\nhard filtering substance, such as stone or gravel, so as to effect and\r\ncontrol the discharge of the waters. Should this be too expensive a\r\nmethod to adopt, and always provided the surface waters are prevented\r\nfrom flowing or trickling into the base of an embankment, the ground\r\nmight be excavated so as to equally incline downwards towards the\r\ncentre, the level at that point being 1 foot to 2 feet below the toe of\r\nthe slope on each side, according to the width of the base of the\r\nembankment; a small trench being cut in the centre and filled with\r\nstones, and covered at the top with brushwood or hurdles or other\r\nprovision necessary to ensure it being permanently an effectual water\r\nchannel, with occasional or other drains to lead the water to the\r\nnearest culvert or side ditch. When it is found that water passes over\r\nthe surface of firm soil upon which an embankment is deposited, the\r\nwater must be intercepted and led away; and should an embankment be of\r\nretentive earth, in order to tap the water that has flowed and\r\npercolated into it, and to restore the earth to its normal condition and\r\nprevent slips and subsidences, it may be necessary to sink shafts to a\r\ndepth of a few feet below the seat of an embankment until the mass is\r\ndrained.\r\n\r\nWith regard to culverts, a settlement or slip of an embankment over a\r\nculvert may unequally strain, fracture, and displace portions of it, and\r\ntherefore interrupt the flow of the drainage waters, which may then\r\nreach the seat of an embankment and cause it to be in a dangerous\r\ncondition. They are usually necessarily placed at the deepest point of\r\nan embankment, and consequently the most difficult to make repairs. In\r\nsuch a situation they should be built sufficiently large to allow of the\r\neasy passage of a man, in order that due inspection may be made, and be\r\nconstructed of materials of a durable character. Should a naturally firm\r\nbank exist on one or both sides of a stream, it should be stripped of\r\nall plant growth and decaying matter, and be preserved in order to form\r\na natural wall to relieve a culvert from side pressure, but firm or hard\r\nmaterial must be inserted between the back of the wall and the face of\r\nthe stream bank so as to support the wall against the pressure it\r\nreceives from the arch. This leads to a consideration of the best form\r\nof culvert. In clay soils, and those which exert pressure from\r\nexpansion, especially if the culvert is surrounded by clay earth, the\r\ncircular is generally considered to be the best form, and this has been\r\nproved to be so in tunnels in similar soil, with splayed wing-walls to\r\nassist and guide the flow and help to keep a clear entrance. In granular\r\nsoils, such as dry sand or gravel, the earth acts differently and more\r\nin accordance with the angle of repose theory of pressure, therefore the\r\nstrain upon the arch would be the greatest, and its thrust must be\r\ncounterbalanced at the sides, the strain upon the invert being probably\r\nvery little and due to the tendency to an overturning movement of either\r\nof the straight walls. However, in culverts as in tunnels, it is\r\nimpossible to say the exact amount or direction of the strain, although\r\nit may be approximately computed.\r\n\r\nShould it be necessary to erect a culvert upon soft ground, as much of\r\nit as practicable should be excavated and a concrete foundation be\r\nplaced thereon; it is also advisable to allow an extra length to that\r\nrequired by the calculated slope.\r\n\r\nA culvert should have an invert unless upon a hard rock bed, and care\r\nshould be taken that there shall be no leakage at the springing of the\r\ninverted arch or under it, or beneath the sidewalls at the level of the\r\nsurface of a flat stone drain or below it.\r\n\r\nThe banks of a stream or watercourse should be inspected occasionally,\r\nespecially on the up-stream side of a culvert, in order to note whether\r\nthey are stable or crumbling away, as then the course of the stream may\r\nbe widened or diverted, and so erode the toe of an embankment and cause\r\na slip of earth. Splayed wing-walls are a protection against such a\r\ndanger besides aiding the flow of water through them, and they also\r\nlessen the chance of a damming back of the water and undermining, as\r\nthey increase the discharge; for instance, a splay of 53° has been found\r\nto increase the flow about 25 per centum. The surface of the material of\r\nwhich a culvert is constructed should be as smooth as practicable, so as\r\nto reduce the friction of water flowing past it, which, in the case of\r\nunplaned timber, cast and wrought ironwork, ashlar masonry, brickwork,\r\nand concrete, is about the same, but is some 30 per cent. more when the\r\nsurface consists of rubble masonry.\r\n\r\nWhen an embankment crosses a narrow valley, in which no watercourse\r\nexists, instead of a culvert, a bed of loose stones has been placed upon\r\nthe ground under the whole area of the seat of an embankment at its\r\ngreatest depth, a proper fall and bed being given to it.\r\n\r\nThe toe of the slope on the up-stream side should be protected from any\r\nwash, and the stone layer be carried a few feet beyond the foot of the\r\nslope on the lower side.\r\n\r\nThe following general principles it is well to remember in designing\r\nculverts.\r\n\r\nWhen a culvert is of uniform section, which is almost invariably the\r\ncase, it should have the same inclination throughout.\r\n\r\nAvoid, or ease, all bends as much as possible.\r\n\r\nHave splayed wing-walls.\r\n\r\nMake provision against undermining by scour or percolation of water.\r\n\r\nHave smooth and even surfaces so as to reduce the friction and increase\r\nthe discharge.\r\n\r\nHave an arched invert to a culvert, and a flat bed stone to all small\r\nsurface drains, with complete connection to the side walls.\r\n\r\nIn some countries having a severe climate, or in high mountainous\r\ndistricts where the soil is rock and a heavy discharge of flood-waters\r\noccurs, instead of placing a culvert and gathering the waters at or\r\nabout the level of the toe of an embankment, in deep hillsides or\r\nravines an unlined tunnel is made under the embankment in the rock, thus\r\navoiding a masonry or brickwork structure, which could only be set in\r\nthe summer months, and preventing the waters touching the seat of an\r\nembankment and promoting a slip.\r\n\r\nWhen the level of a rivulet allows, and the waters are simply surface\r\ndischarge, the system has been used of making two open channels, one\r\nupon each side of a steep valley, thus retaining the waters, allowing\r\nthe adoption of two short span open culverts and two channels instead of\r\none large culvert at the deepest place, and saving expense, the original\r\nbed of watercourse being filled with the surplus excavation. The\r\nembankment consisting of broken rock or hard granular soil, any little\r\npercolation of water along the old bed will not deleteriously affect it,\r\nbut will find a passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  APPROXIMATE SAFE MAXIMUM LOAD UPON DIFFERENT EARTHS.—NORMAL\r\n    PRESSURE OF THE EARTH.—THE SAFE MAXIMUM LOAD UPON DEPOSITED\r\n    EARTH.—APPROXIMATE SAFE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF AN EMBANKMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no limit to the depth of a cutting except a due regard to\r\neconomical construction, provided the slopes are sufficiently flat, and\r\nthe lateral and upward fluid pressure in the slope, and formation and\r\nquantity of water not too great for the stability of the earth; but, in\r\nthe case of embankments, the load upon the ground and the deposited\r\nmaterial in great measure restricts the height, or necessitates an\r\nembankment being gradually spread out, so as to enlarge the bearing area\r\nas the weight is increased.\r\n\r\nThe following values of the safe maximum compressive load have been\r\ncompiled from actual practice, but are, of course, only intended as a\r\nguide to the safe load for foundations excavated in ground not\r\nartificially deposited. The condition of the earth in each case should\r\nbe considered, and in works of magnitude it is advisable to make\r\nexperiments extending as long as practicable, and for at least a month,\r\nand it is false economy not to carefully ascertain the character,\r\ncondition and other circumstances of a foundation destined to support\r\nany part of a structure, a failure of which may result in serious\r\nconsequences; and it should be borne in mind that a continuous surface\r\npossesses greater sustaining power than the same area in detached\r\nportions, as the adhesion of the sides is not destroyed; similarly, the\r\nload that a tenacious earth will support upon a small area is somewhat\r\ngreater than over a large area, because the lateral surfaces are\r\nrelatively larger in proportion to the area, and, therefore, the effect\r\nof cohesion is proportionately greater; but in loose soils it is not so,\r\nfor cohesion exists but in name, and the ground around would be upheaved\r\nupon an excessive load being superimposed. In testing the weight any\r\nearth will support, it is not so much the first settlement, provided it\r\nis not excessive, that it is desirous to know, but whether after the\r\nfirst settlement it ceases or the earth, as it were, reacts and\r\nrebounds, which it may do in firm ground to the extent of one-eighth to\r\nhalf an inch. If so, the ground is not overloaded.\r\n\r\nAfter ascertaining by experiment the pressure any earth will bear over a\r\ngiven area, the object should be to make the soil neither drier nor\r\nwetter than that of its natural state when experimenting, and it should\r\nbe maintained in that condition. In testing the weight which a soft\r\nearth will support, some days should be allowed for the sinking of the\r\ntest platform, and such subsidence should be ascertained periodically by\r\ncareful levels. A month is not too long for a reliable and complete\r\ntest, as many soft soils continue to yield. In soft clay soils\r\nconsiderable depression often proceeds for weeks after a load has been\r\napplied, but except in peculiar earths such settlement will ultimately\r\nbe imperceptible, and will practically cease. A considerable margin of\r\nstability should in all cases be allowed. Although it may not be\r\nabsolutely necessary to experiment when the nature of the ground is well\r\nknown, wherever stability is of great importance, the cost of a\r\npractical experiment being so small, there is no sufficient reason why\r\nan actual test of the sustaining power of the soil should not be made in\r\nthe majority of instances, for there are many earths whose friction and\r\ncohesiveness can alone be depended upon for resistance to displacement.\r\nIn such cases the initial pressure upon the earth should not be much\r\nexceeded.\r\n\r\n                   Description of Earth.

Compact gravel. 2. Clean gravel. 3. Sandy gravel. 4.\r\n Clayey or loamy gravel.\r\n\r\n Sound, clean, homogeneous Thames gravel has been weighted\r\n with 14 tons per square foot at a depth of only 3 to 5\r\n feet below the surface, and presented no indication of\r\n failure. This gravel was similar to that of a clean pebbly\r\n beach.\r\n\r\nIn loose non-cohesive earths the load may be increased, when the depth\r\nis considerable, as the soil has been subject to a greater normal\r\npressure due to the weight of the soil upon it at any depth; but it is\r\nnot advisable to consider such increase of bearing power of the soil,\r\nunless at any depth it is found that the normal pressure augments the\r\nbearing power and makes the earth more dense, which may be approximately\r\nascertained by experiment. In such event the load upon the base can be\r\nincreased by the weight of the normal pressure removed. Supposing 5 tons\r\nper square foot was known to be the safe load upon the surface of the\r\nground, and at any depth it was found that the normal pressure of the\r\nsoil was 2 tons; 5 + 2 = 7 tons placed at that depth would equal 5 tons\r\nat the surface. In the worst case, when the loose earth is of great\r\ndepth, and it is certain that it cannot be tapped or disturbed at the\r\ndepth at which it is decided to place the foundations of a structure,\r\nprovided the load is not more than the normal pressure, it is not\r\nprobable that it will subside or slip, as no additional weight is\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\nIn foundation and general work, rocks are usually not loaded with a\r\ngreater weight than from 8 to 18 tons per square foot, according to the\r\ncharacter of the rock. As the crushing strength has been principally\r\nascertained from cubes, and not from prisms, rectangular blocks, or\r\nirregularly shaped pieces, and as the resistance of rocks to transverse\r\nstrain or breaking across is considerably less than the compressive\r\nstrength, and varies greatly and not always according to the crushing\r\nresistance of the material, from 8 to 20 tons per square foot is a\r\nprudent limit for the safe load, and should not be exceeded unless under\r\nexceptional circumstances; as unequal bearing may greatly intensify the\r\nstrain, and irregularity in the texture may reduce the resisting powers\r\nto that of the weakest part. Sandstone rock that can be crumbled in the\r\nhand should not be loaded with more than 1½ to 1¾ ton per square foot,\r\nor it will probably begin to flake and disintegrate. The strength of\r\nsandstone varies very greatly, and in experiments it has been found that\r\nwhen fine close grained, it supported before being crushed five times\r\nthe weight that very coarse gritty sandstone, having a sandy appearance,\r\nwould sustain; the respective crushing pressures per square foot being\r\n362 and 67 tons.\r\n\r\nReference to authorities on the resistance of stones to crushing,\r\ntension and transverse strain, will give the approximate safe load per\r\nsquare foot; but in foundations, _i.e._, upon the rock in its natural\r\nlocation, it should not exceed one-tenth of the ultimate resistance, and\r\nthe compressive strength should not alone be taken as a guide to the\r\nsafe load, but the resistance of the rock to tensional and transverse\r\nstrain should be considered. The value given for crumbling sandstone is\r\nfor the softest material that can be called rock, and is merely stated\r\nto show that although some earths may be generally classed as rocks\r\ntheir bearing power may be limited. The safe load upon an artificial\r\nrubble mound foundation depends upon its character, and firmness and\r\nsolidity when deposited, and upon that of the ground on which it is\r\nplaced. No general values can be named, although it may be classed as\r\nclean or compact gravel.\r\n\r\nIn a cutting, by excavation, the normal pressure of the earth, which\r\nvaries with the depth and weight of the soil, is removed.\r\n\r\nLet\r\n\r\n  D = the depth in feet of a cutting from the original surface of the\r\n        ground,\r\n\r\n  W = the weight of a cubic foot of earth in decimals of a ton,\r\n\r\n  P = the normal pressure in tons per square foot at any given depth,\r\n\r\n        Then                     P = D × W.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the case of an embankment the normal load upon the\r\nearth is not affected, but an additional weight is superimposed;\r\nconsequently, to prevent slips or subsidence from overweighting, there\r\nis a limit to the height of an embankment, apart from economical\r\nconsiderations of its deposition. The problem to determine is,\r\ntherefore, the limit of the height to which an embankment may be\r\ndeposited without exceeding the safe load that the natural ground will\r\npermanently sustain. The safe load upon the earth of which an embankment\r\nis composed is referred to in due course.\r\n\r\nLet\r\n\r\n  S = the safe load in tons per square foot upon the original ground or\r\n        earth not artificially deposited.\r\n\r\n  H = the theoretical limiting height in feet of an embankment.\r\n\r\n  W = the weight in tons of a cubic foot of the deposited earth.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—When the earth is of a mixed character, the safe load should be\r\nthat of the weakest soil.\r\n\r\nThe condition of equilibrium is that the height is not greater than the\r\nsafe load divided by the weight of the ground, and is consequently given\r\nby the expression—\r\n\r\n                                H = S/W.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent a reference to other books, a table is appended of\r\nthe approximate weights of different earths in their ordinary condition,\r\ncompiled from the best authorities.\r\n\r\nThe weights are those of solid rock, therefore, when it is deposited\r\nthey will be lighter according to the volume of the interstices.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────\r\n             Name of Earth.             │            Weight.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────┬───────────────\r\n                                        │ Decimals of a │     Tons.\r\n                                        │     Ton.      │  Cubic Yard.\r\n                                        │  Cubic Foot.  │\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────\r\n Basalt, solid                          │     0·083     │           2·25\r\n Bath stone, solid                      │     0·052     │           1·40\r\n Chalk, damp to wet, loose to close     │0·056 to 0·074 │   1·50 to 2·00\r\n Clay                                   │0·054 to 0·059 │   1·45 to 1·60\r\n Flint, solid                           │     0·074     │           2·00\r\n Granite                                │     0·078     │           2·10\r\n Gravel and shingle                     │0·046 to 0·055 │   1·25 to 1·50\r\n Limestone.

Excavated earth cannot be restored in bulk to its original condition.\r\n\r\n2. When the earth is simply deposited from a tip head, it cannot be\r\nimmediately consolidated by the act of deposition.\r\n\r\n3. Until subsidence may, for all practical purposes, be considered at an\r\nend, no deposited earth can be regarded as stable; but a mere uniform\r\nweathering of the surface, which cannot be prevented when the exterior\r\nis uncovered, will generally not cause instability of the mass.\r\n\r\n4. Upon most public works the earth in an embankment is exposed in thin\r\nlayers.\r\n\r\n5. The earth is loaded, in the great majority of cases, soon after it is\r\ndeposited and before it has settled or become consolidated, and is also\r\nsubject to vibration from earth waggons, locomotives, &c.\r\n\r\n6. The comparative dry or wet state of the deposited earth and its power\r\nof resistance to meteorological deterioration. _Vide_ also Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration these and other deteriorating influences, the\r\nproblem to be solved is, what deduction must be made from the safe load\r\nupon unexcavated earth in foundations, in order to know the safe\r\nsustaining power of the same earth when deposited in an embankment? Much\r\ndepends upon the liability of the soil to become saturated or in a\r\ndamper state than that in which it is known to be stable. For this\r\nreason the height of embankments in clay soils, which are so\r\ndeleteriously affected by the weather, is generally made as little as\r\npossible. Of course, temporarily an embankment will stand with a greater\r\npressure, _i.e._, at a greater height than the safe height, and,\r\nprovided no lateral movement took place, an embankment would be stable\r\nuntil the earth was nearly crushed; but permanent stability and freedom\r\nfrom slips and subsidence is the object to be attained, and everything\r\nmust be subject to local conditions, such as the amount of rainfall, the\r\nsituation, the care exercised during deposition, the protection given to\r\nthe surface, and the general drainage, and these must always govern the\r\napplication of any general rule. It is, therefore, necessary to divide\r\nearths into two kinds, namely:—granular and non-granular; the former is\r\nassumed to have particles, for purposes of earthwork, insoluble in\r\nwater, the latter to be liable to be dissolved by aqueous action, or to\r\nbe so affected by it as to lessen the stability. It is impracticable to\r\ndetermine by a formula the permanent safe maximum height of an\r\nembankment; the values named are, however, an approximately reliable\r\nindication of the height, and are based upon the assumption that the\r\nslopes are sufficiently flat to be stable, and that the embankments are\r\ndeposited in the ordinary way, the width of the formation or top being\r\nnot less than about 15 feet. It is seldom economical to make an\r\nembankment more than 70 to 90 feet in height, except for short lengths,\r\nand where deep cuttings cannot be avoided, and it becomes a question of\r\ntipping spoil banks or main embankments, or the foundations for a\r\nviaduct are known to be of a treacherous and doubtful character. The\r\nheights named have been calculated under the worst conditions, _i.e._,\r\nthat any weight upon the formation will be directly communicated to the\r\nbase as in the case of a column, and not through the cross-section of an\r\nembankment, and over the whole area of the base; however, there is\r\nalways the danger that the central portion may subside, as the weight\r\nupon it is the greatest, and that the slopes may be disturbed and\r\npressed out, especially in soft or soluble earth likely to be quickly\r\naffected by moisture. The soil is considered to have no reliable\r\ncohesion.\r\n\r\nIn this country the limits of general practice for the height of\r\nembankments when unaided by retaining walls or other support, but with\r\nthe slopes soiled, covered with grass, and only externally drained, has\r\nbeen as follows:—\r\n\r\n Surface soils, about 20 to 30 feet.\r\n Boulder clay from 25 to 30 feet.\r\n Yellow, or ordinary clay, 30 to 40 feet.\r\n Ditto, ditto, in cuttings, 60 to 65 feet.\r\n Chalk, 30 to 40 feet.\r\n Gravel and sand, about 60 feet.\r\n Ditto, in cuttings, 80 feet.\r\n\r\nThese have, however, been exceeded in many instances, especially upon\r\nthe lower side of an embankment upon sidelong ground. Probably the\r\nhighest artificial embankments unsupported by walls or any protective\r\nworks, are quarry and mining-tips, and ballast-heaps. These have been\r\ncast out in all weathers, and allowed to assume any slope or shape, and\r\nto a height as great as 100 to 120 feet, and have remained stable,\r\nalthough usually in an exposed situation, but almost free from\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VI. a railway embankment 90 feet in height, in treacherous\r\nclay-soil is instanced, and there are many embankments of various earths\r\nfrom 70 to 90 feet in height on the centre line, but a railway\r\nembankment exceeding 100 feet in height on the centre line is rare,\r\nalthough the height from the toe of the slope to the formation level in\r\nsidelong ground may be frequently exceeded. A short and very high\r\nembankment may stand where one of considerable length would slip,\r\nconsequent upon variations in the character and condition of the earth,\r\nthe bearing capacity of the ground, the state of the weather, the flow\r\nof the surface water, general homogeneousness, the configuration of the\r\nground, and other deteriorating influences; but draining, careful\r\ndeposition, and a judicious adoption of the varying slope system, and\r\nother precautionary works, will conduce to stability. Unless in\r\nexceptional circumstances, it is advisable to avoid very high\r\nembankments, as a slip of earthwork seldom gives much prevenient notice,\r\nand the works of reparation can scarcely be effected by any means than\r\nmanual labour. The quantity of earth to be treated may be so large that\r\nbefore the remedial works can be completed a wet season may arrest\r\noperations and cause additional movement and subsidence of the earth.\r\n\r\n                            GRANULAR EARTHS.\r\n\r\n         Description of Earth Embankment.

At\r\n  a height of only 50 feet clear head, the pressure would be about 22\r\n  lbs. per square inch; therefore, it is not so much the weight the\r\n  deposited earth will bear as the effects of water upon the earth,\r\n  and the water pressure that have to be considered.\r\n\r\n                              OTHER EARTHS.\r\n\r\n         Description of Earth Embankment.

Almost all\r\naluminous or calcareous earths hold or retain water in varying quantity,\r\nand as in embankments this may constantly change, no safe permanent\r\nheight of an embankment in such soils can be established. The most solid\r\nimpermeable clay when separated into small pieces and impregnated with\r\nwater to any quantity above that it normally contains, will have its\r\nbearing power and general stability reduced, until, when saturated, it\r\nbecomes as mud. Impure and argillaceous chalk, marly clay, marl, and\r\nshale, are all more or less weakened by aqueous action, and their safe\r\npermanent height may be anything not exceeding the crushing strength of\r\nthe earth, with a due allowance for the deteriorating influences of\r\nweather, vibration, and internal water-pressure.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter reference has been made to certain limits of the safe\r\nheight of embankments; but were these to be adopted as _the_ maximum\r\nsafe height in each earth it would be an indefensible edict, for by the\r\nadoption of the required precautionary measures named in the several\r\nchapters of this book the height can be considerably increased, and what\r\nis more, has been much exceeded with impunity in numerous instances. The\r\ninclination that any earth assumes, after being exposed to the weather a\r\nsufficient time for it to be affected by it, will afford a good\r\nindication of the safe load it will support. As the slope of repose\r\nbecomes flatter, the bearing power of the soil in an embankment will be\r\nreduced, all the deteriorating influences being identical.\r\n\r\nFor the best information “On the actual lateral pressure of earthwork,”\r\n_vide_ the paper by Sir B.

An unnecessarily flat slope is not only a monetary waste but\r\nmay be a cause of instability, for it exposes a larger surface to\r\ndeterioration by the weather. By what means is a correct decision to be\r\nattained? Experience has shown that certain earths under known\r\nconditions will repose at particular inclinations; however, to\r\nempirically assume that any earth will always stand under any\r\ncircumstances is clearly imprudent and untenable. As a guide, a table of\r\nslopes for earths is valuable, but consideration of the consequences of\r\nmovement, and the distinctive features of each case should govern a\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nShould the earth be treacherous and require a flat slope, it may be\r\nadvisable to reduce the quantity of excavation by the erection of a\r\nretaining wall, not only to effect a saving in expenditure, but also to\r\npermanently support the soil, and prevent instability.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of neighbouring quarries and the waste tips, sand or\r\ngravel pits, hills and cliffs, cuttings and embankments for roads, river\r\nbanks, &c., will afford an indication of any local peculiarities caused\r\nby the climate or otherwise; and a comparison of the natural slopes\r\nassumed when the soil has to withstand vibration, and when not so\r\ndisturbed, will enable a judgment to be formed of its deleterious effect\r\nupon the earth; but above all, an examination of the cuttings and\r\nembankments passing through or upon the same geological formation.\r\nReliable evidence can be so obtained upon which the slope of permanent\r\nrepose can be determined according to the dictates of science and\r\nexperience, but the probable consequences of instability will demand a\r\ndue regard to provision against contingent deteriorating influences\r\nwhich may almost destroy cohesion and render it necessary to rely solely\r\nupon frictional resistance, the remaining resisting power against\r\nmovement of the earth, except in solid rock, which may stand with an\r\noverhanging or vertical face, whereas mud and quicksand may not be in a\r\nstate of rest even when horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe following table of slopes for different earths has been carefully\r\ncompiled to indicate the probable permanent slope, but it should not be\r\nseparately considered from the other chapters in this book, as\r\ncircumstances modify even a considerable range of inclinations; for\r\ninstance, earths that will be stable at a certain slope in temperate\r\nclimates will require a much flatter slope in tropical or very cold\r\ncountries. Those named are more especially for artificially deposited or\r\nembanked earths subject to vibration, and, therefore, in cuttings the\r\nslope might be steeper, although not so in aluminous soils or those in\r\nwhich the particles become decomposed upon exposure. In Chapter II.,\r\nunder the head of each kind of earth, the approximate slopes of repose\r\nare more exactly named, as they would occupy too much space in a table.\r\nWhen not mentioned in Chapter II. the slope is given.\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTE.—The slopes must be flatter according to the amount of\r\nwater in the same soil or to which it may be subject, the depth of a\r\ncutting and height of an embankment, and the presence of all other\r\ndisturbing influences. _Vide_ Chapter V. for the safe maximum depth of\r\ncuttings or height of embankments.\r\n\r\n\r\n               TABLE SHOWING THE GENERAL RANGE OF SLOPES.\r\n\r\n               Description of Earth.

The angle of repose\r\n will be less as the size of the particles become\r\n smaller, and between high water and a few feet\r\n below low-water mark will seldom be less, if not\r\n sheltered, than 4 to 1 to 6 to 1; but coarse firm\r\n sand that has become consolidated will often stand\r\n at a steeper inclination than a mass of rolling\r\n stones, however hard they may be.\r\n\r\n Compact gravel                                            1 to 1\r\n\r\n Ordinary road metalling, moderate height            1 to 1 (clean), TO\r\n                                                    1¼ to 1 (stacked, as\r\n                                                       excavated from\r\n                                                           road.)\r\n\r\n Large concrete blocks.

Exposed to sea                       2½ to 1 (sea slope.)\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—If an exposed coast, the rubble may require from 4 to 1 to 7\r\n  to 1 slope, depending upon its size, the currents, depth, and\r\n  “fetch” of the sea, and solidity of the mass.\r\n\r\nThe usual slopes adopted for cuttings and embankments may be said to\r\nrange from 1 to 1 for firm earth, having particles not seriously\r\naffected by water or weather, to 4 to 1, and the most frequent, 1 to 1\r\nTO 1½ to 1 in cuttings and 1½ to 1 in embankments.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the chief organ of stability in earths other than rock,\r\nnamely, the frictional resistance; friction during motion is generally\r\nconsidered to be less than the force necessary to overcome it when at\r\nrest, and undoubtedly this is the case when the surfaces are similar,\r\nand are smooth and hard and not easily impressed, as iron, granite,\r\nconcrete, and metals generally; but when they are comparatively soft and\r\nincapable of resisting indentation at any pressure that they may have to\r\nbear, the difference between the coefficient of friction during motion\r\nand that at the commencement of motion or of repose will not be so\r\nmarked, for other resistances may come into action not due _solely_ to\r\nsurface friction of the mass. A surface may become indented or roughened\r\nthus offering opposition to motion not existing at the commencement of\r\nmovement, and particularly so in any earth of a mixed character\r\npossessing hard particles, such as boulders, or sand in clay. On the\r\nother hand, in the case of hard rock, solid clay, or other homogeneous\r\nearth, the difference between friction during motion and that of\r\nfriction at rest may be reliably determined.\r\n\r\nIn soils of a granular or gritty nature small particles become detached\r\nduring motion, and by pressure occupy or become wedged into any cavities\r\nupon the surfaces, and therefore offer resistance which is not _alone_\r\ndue to friction of a mass upon a like mass. From this cause friction\r\nduring motion may seemingly even become greater than during rest, but\r\nwith material consisting of rounded particles that will not wedge, the\r\nfriction upon a sliding surface may be lessened by reason of the grains\r\nrevolving.\r\n\r\nIn deducing a slope of repose for earth, the lowest value of frictional\r\nresistance, whether during motion or at rest, should be taken, and\r\nalways as if the surfaces were wet. The coefficients of friction, F,\r\nduring motion usually range between 0·25 to 1·10, and the slope of\r\nrepose, S to 1, is consequently found by the expression—\r\n\r\n                                S = 1/F,\r\n\r\ntherefore, S would equal to 1/0·25 to 1/1·10 = 4 to 1 TO 0·91 to 1, say,\r\n1 to 1.\r\n\r\nThis is the required inclination to prevent movement provided no\r\npressure is exerted upon the surface, and not taking into consideration\r\nthe disturbing and weakening effects of vibration and all other\r\ndeteriorating influences, such as the variable degree of moisture of the\r\nsoil, the irregularity of its character, the destruction of the\r\ncontinuity of the surface by trenches or drains in a slope, the effect\r\nof gravity to detach a mass, the process of excavation or deposition,\r\nand the expansion and contraction of soils of an argillaceous nature.\r\nWhen any earth becomes suddenly water-charged or deteriorated by any of\r\nthe agencies previously and subsequently mentioned, movement may be\r\nexpected, and it should be remembered that in the same soil the\r\nresisting powers to disintegration frequently vary, consequent upon\r\ninequality in the quantity of moisture, the roughness, evenness,\r\nsmoothness, compactness, looseness, the degree of fineness of the earth,\r\nand also the manner in which strain is applied.\r\n\r\nFriction upon a dry surface is almost invariably greater than that upon\r\na wetted surface, and is so beyond all question upon any plane\r\nlubricated with an unguent. The disturbing and enfeebling effect of\r\nwater may be judged from a careful analysis of many reliable experiments\r\nto ascertain the frictional resistance in the case of the same material\r\nin a dry and in a wet state on an unplaned surface of cast iron and on\r\ntimber piles. It shows the following results in addition to those given\r\nin the table of coefficients of friction of earth upon earth in the next\r\npage.\r\n\r\nThe surface friction of masonry or brickwork upon dry clay is reduced by\r\nfrom 25 to 30 per cent. when the clay is wet.\r\n\r\nThe frictional resistance of an unplaned surface of cast iron upon wet\r\nsand is about 16 per cent. less than the resistance upon the same\r\nmaterial when dry. In the case of timber piles, it is about 12 per cent.\r\nless, and about 40 per cent. less in sandy clay and gravelly clay soil.\r\n\r\nIn sandy gravel the difference in the resistances is small, being only\r\nfrom 5 to 10 per cent. less when the earth is wet.\r\n\r\nSand has about 20 per cent. more friction than sandy gravel, both\r\nmaterials being in a wet state; and below a depth of from 10 to 15 feet,\r\nthe frictional resistance increases little in gravelly sand and gravelly\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a sufficient example under similar conditions and\r\ncircumstances, the most reliable method to ascertain the slope of repose\r\nof any earth is that of S, the slope of repose, to 1, = 1/F, any\r\ncohesion of the soil being disregarded and considered as a margin of\r\nstability liable to be much impaired; and, therefore, except in a mass,\r\nit is prudent to look upon it as non-existent in the whole of a slope;\r\nand when motion has commenced, as even a means of accelerating movement\r\nby causing lumps to become displaced instead of mere particles.\r\n\r\nThe following coefficients of friction during motion are here given in\r\nconfirmation of the frictional resistance of an earth being an indicator\r\nof its slope of repose.\r\n\r\nThey have been tabulated from different authorities, are the average\r\nresults of practical experiments, and have been compared with the\r\ninclination of slopes actually assumed under the ordinary conditions of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────┬────────────┬──────────────────\r\n    Description of Earth or Material.   │Coefficient │  Corresponding\r\n            Earth upon Earth.           │of Friction │      Slope.\r\n                                        │   during   │  S TO 1 = 1/F.\r\n                                        │ Motion—F.  │\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────┼────────────┼──────────────────\r\n Damp vegetable or loamy earth          │0·50 to 0·67│2 to 1 TO 1½ to 1\r\n Clean dry shingle or ballast, nearly   │0·75 to 0·80│1⅓ to 1 TO 1¼ to 1\r\n   without sand                         │            │\r\n Clean wet shingle or ballast, nearly   │    0·67    │     1¼ to 1\r\n   without sand                         │            │\r\n Shingle or ballast with ordinary       │    0·80    │     1¼ to 1\r\n   quantity of sand                     │            │\r\n NOTE.—The presence of sand in gravel   │            │\r\n increases the frictional resistance    │            │\r\n because it makes it gritty.            │            │\r\n Excavated hard road metalling, cast    │    0·80    │     1¼ to 1\r\n   into a mound                         │            │\r\n Fine dry sand                          │    0·75    │     1⅓ to 1\r\n Hard clay, slightly damp               │    0·67    │     1½ to 1\r\n Hard clay, damp to wet                 │0·40 to 0·50│2½ to 1 TO 2 to 1\r\n Damp lias, yellow, and most upheaved   │0·25 to 0·33│ 4 to 1 TO 3 to 1\r\n   clays in superficial beds            │            │\r\n Wet rubble on wet rubble, ordinary size│0·67 to 0·80│1½ to 1 TO 1¼ to 1\r\n   and character                        │            │\r\n Do., do., when the surfaces are unclean│    0·67    │     1½ to 1\r\n Do., do., Large to very large size.    │0·80 to 1·0 │1¼ to 1 TO 1 to 1\r\n   Surfaces clean                       │            │\r\n NOTE.—All rubble carefully deposited.  │            │\r\n Rough-faced granite on gravel and sand,│    0·54    │    1·85 to 1\r\n   both dry                             │            │\r\n Rough-faced granite on gravel and sand,│    0·48    │    2·09 to 1\r\n   both wet                             │            │\r\n Rough-faced granite on sand, both dry. │    0·70    │     1½ to 1\r\n Rough-faced granite on sand, both wet  │    0·53    │    1·88 to 1\r\n                                        │            │\r\n     CONSTRUCTED MATERIAL ON EARTH.     │            │\r\n                                        │            │\r\n Rubble masonry, or brickwork on clay,  │    0·50    │      2 to 1\r\n   dry                                  │            │\r\n Rubble masonry, or brickwork on clay,  │    0·33    │      3 to 1\r\n   wet                                  │            │\r\n                                        │            │\r\n NOTE.—_Vide_ Chapter II.               │            │\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────┴────────────┴──────────────────\r\n\r\nFriction is the chief cause of stability in granular soils and those\r\nreadily affected by moisture which have for practical purposes no\r\nimmutable cohesion. In few earths are both cohesion and friction of\r\nconsiderable and reliable value, one or the other quickly becoming\r\nimpaired or destroyed. Movement is caused by such various means that\r\neach earth must be separately considered, and also the circumstances\r\nunder which it is placed. The particles of the earth may be dissolved by\r\nwater and become in a muddy state, or they may be considered insoluble\r\nas in clean sand and gravel, although in compact sand or gravel the\r\ncementing material may crack and weather. Provided it was certain any\r\nearth would always remain as originally formed, a condition which it is\r\nimpossible to guarantee in work, the cohesion and frictional resistance\r\nbeing known, the correct slope could be mathematically determined, but\r\nas all earths are subject to varying deteriorating influences, such a\r\ndeduction is only valuable as a guide for reasonable inference. Cohesion\r\nmay be more quickly impaired by certain action than friction, and _vice\r\nversâ_. Probably, of all soils, that to be most distrusted is one that\r\nexpands and contracts, such as clay earth, which although possessing\r\nconsiderable cohesion may become upon drying a mere congregation of\r\ndisconnected lumps ready to move upon the return of wet weather, thus\r\nits considerable power of cohesion may practically be one of the chief\r\ncauses of a slip. On the contrary, clean sand, although devoid of\r\ncohesion, will not crack or have a greasy surface, but the particles may\r\nbe washed away.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain that any earth is uniformly affected throughout the mass,\r\nand to prevent or provide against deteriorating influences is the chief\r\naim. It is useless to declare any earth possesses considerable cohesion\r\nwhen the power can be quickly dissipated by ordinary atmospheric action\r\nand even become a cause of movement, and to rely for permanent stability\r\nupon such property. In ordinary earths, not rock, it will generally be\r\nfound that cohesion is small or insignificant in soil having a\r\ncoefficient of friction of some moment, and the reverse. In most earths\r\nfriction, although it is affected in a greater degree by vibration, has\r\nto be relied upon, and not cohesion, as the latter is variable and may\r\nexist almost unimpaired in a lump, which nevertheless may become\r\ndetached because of fissures. The coefficients of friction of different\r\nearths are also better known than the cohesion; but how easily even\r\nfriction is impaired may be gathered from the sudden manner in which\r\nbridge cylinders will sink after having hung for days by surface\r\nfriction, or been held by the transitory expansion of clay. Mr. Wilfrid\r\nAiry, B.A., in a series of experiments on the cohesion of earth, found\r\nthat in strong brick loam it is about 168 lbs. per square foot, in\r\ncompact clay and gravel it may reach 800 lbs. per square foot of\r\nsection, and in clean sand it is practically nihil.\r\n\r\nIn rock the slope of repose depends whether the earth is unstratified or\r\nstratified; and if stratified, upon the dip of the strata and their\r\nresistance to the effects of the weather. A vertical face may be stable\r\nin unstratified or stratified rock, provided in the latter case it does\r\nnot dip towards a cutting; or the requisite slope may range from ¼ to 1\r\nto such an inclination that the cohesion and friction, which vary\r\ngreatly, are sufficient to prevent movement. In sidelong ground should\r\nthe rock dip parallel to the surface the hill slope may require to be\r\nflat, whereas the valley slope may stand vertically.\r\n\r\nAlthough, perhaps, in many instances the slopes of cuttings and\r\nembankments have been arbitrarily fixed, it may be said, on the whole,\r\nno very serious interruptions to traffic have been caused from the _sole\r\nwant of sufficient initial flatness of a slope_, as that will soon\r\nbecome known. In determining the inclination it is not the angle at\r\nwhich the earth will stand at the time of excavation or deposition, and\r\nfor a few months after that is required to be ascertained, but that\r\nwhich will _permanently_ suffice to prevent movement. It is well known\r\nthat almost all freshly cut soil stands nearly vertically for a small\r\ndepth for a few days in ordinary weather but then begins to crumble and\r\nfinally break away.\r\n\r\nWhat then will be the slope of permanent stability? This chiefly depends\r\nupon the degree of exposure, the effects of the weather, water, and\r\nvibration upon the soil, and the depth or height of a cutting or\r\nembankment.\r\n\r\nEach earth requires to be duly considered; for instance, gravel and sand\r\nare pieces of rock, however small, and for earthwork purposes the\r\nparticles may be regarded as insoluble in water; nevertheless in the\r\ncase of sand, should it be charged with water, it may be necessary to\r\ntreat it as a fluid, the same as mud, although water does not change the\r\nparticles; however, slips in cuttings and embankments in sandy or\r\ngravelly soils are not usually caused by their becoming gradually\r\nsaturated throughout their mass, but by a flow of water which creates\r\nwater seams: the stability, therefore, is dependent upon equal\r\npercolation and drainage and protection of the surface; and the slope\r\nthat should be given to a sand cutting is also governed by the quantity\r\nof water it will have to hold, and whether the sand is pure or loamy.\r\nThe depth of a cutting in sand has a considerable influence upon the\r\nslope of stability, for frequently sand is in a dry state in the upper\r\nportion of a cutting, but beneath it is wet, and partakes more of a\r\nsilty character, and therefore may stand at a steeper inclination in the\r\nupper part, but require a flat slope in the lower portion. The same\r\nconditions are found in all soils, and the sides of a cutting vary, one\r\nmay be comparatively compact and free from water, the other in a wet\r\nstate and disintegrated. They will not permanently repose at the same\r\nangle, the slope varying according to the degree of dryness, size, and\r\nuniformity of the particles. In all earths in which cohesion is liable\r\nto be quickly destroyed, a straight slope is the best as having an even\r\nsurface, which prevents the formation of depressions and causes the\r\nwater to drain away, and also offers the least surface to the weather.\r\nIn all earth such as shingle, gravel, or sand, consisting of pieces of\r\nrock or rubble, or having round particles, it is important to remember\r\nthat any surface disturbance may cause serious movement, particularly\r\nshould it commence at the bottom of a slope, as then the revolving\r\naction may not cease until a flatter inclination is produced by material\r\nrolling from the top and not reposing until it nearly reaches the base.\r\nThe quantity of moisture is the chief governing condition of the slope\r\nof repose in clay soils, and it should not be forgotten that this may\r\nvary considerably. Clay when only slightly moist may stand at a 1 to 1\r\nor 1½ to 1 slope, but as it gradually becomes in a wet state will\r\nrequire a flatter inclination, and may not be at rest until the slope is\r\nat least 3 to 1, and it is not safe to rely upon a steeper slope than 3\r\nto 1 in the case of almost any surface clay beds liable to become\r\ncharged with water, and even 4 to 1, should the excavation be on the\r\nside of a clay hill and near houses, or the ground be loaded; but clay\r\nhaving some powers of cohesion which usually are greater as the clay is\r\nharder, is not so quickly disintegrated as in the case of more porous\r\nsoil, and the form of the slope it assumes is not a straight line; that\r\nmost usually approached by sand or gravel or a granular soil consisting\r\nof particles of the same character, although the lower part of the slope\r\nmay be flattened consequent upon the erosion of the finer particles\r\nwhich crumble and become deposited at the base.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the greater the cohesion of the soil the more curved is its\r\nnatural slope, the greatest pressure being at the base where the\r\ninclination is flatter, and is steeper towards the top, as the ground\r\nmay be held together by cohesion at a vertical face. The harder and\r\nlooser the particles the straighter will be the slope, and if the ground\r\ngradually increases in firmness it will usually be nearly straight; but\r\nif the contrary condition exists, the natural slope will be flatter\r\ntowards the base although nearly vertical for a few feet from the top.\r\n\r\nAs a proof how quickly clay becomes less stable and loses its cohesive\r\npower with the usual quantity of moisture in it, when first tipped it\r\nmay assume a slope of 1 to 1 TO 1½ to 1, but upon exposure to the\r\nweather, which causes the lumps to waste away and the clay to swell from\r\nmoisture and other agencies, the firmest clay in cuttings and\r\nembankments may be said to be unstable until a slope of at least 1½ to 1\r\nis reached in moderate depths, and 2 to 1 TO 3 to 1 in high embankments\r\nor deep cuttings. In all earths the chief cause of movement of earth is\r\nwater, and the main questions to be decided are so far as regards the\r\ninclination of the slope.\r\n\r\n1. Should the surfaces of a cutting be drained and protected and be\r\nexcavated to a comparatively steep slope; or,\r\n\r\n2. Should they be left undrained and uncovered and be excavated to a\r\nflat slope. Provided a cutting can be readily drained and covered and\r\nthere is no probability of any sudden or permanent increase of moisture,\r\nperhaps the first method is the more economical; but much depends upon\r\nthe quantity of water held by the earth in its normal state, whether it\r\nis of the same character throughout, and the depth of a cutting. Should\r\nthe beds be upheaved or intermixed, then a flat slope is necessary and\r\nno covering except a wall may make it stable at a steep slope, and, for\r\ninstance, should clay be always in a semi-saturated condition, 3 to 1 is\r\nthe least slope at which it will permanently stand, and it will usually\r\nrequire a more moderate inclination. A medium course to adopt is that of\r\nvarying the inclination of the slopes, the steepest, of course, being at\r\nthe top and the flattest towards the toe; this is in accordance with the\r\nlaws of pressure and a mathematical investigation of the theoretically\r\ncorrect slope, which nearly corresponds with the actual slope a high\r\nembankment will assume when allowed to weather and settle: for by\r\nvarying the inclination of the slope the latter becomes practically a\r\ncurved line and approximates to that of the curve of equilibrium. In\r\nalmost all slips the surface from which the fallen mass has become\r\ndetached is curved, the upper part being concave and the lower slightly\r\nconvex, the outline being caused from the upper portion falling, the\r\nlower receiving it and being pressed outwards; however, it may happen\r\nthat the lower part of a slope has remained intact, and only the upper\r\nslipped and become deposited upon it.\r\n\r\nThe varying slope system has recently been adopted by Mr. Francis Fox,\r\nM. Inst. C.E., upon the Scarborough and Whitby Railway, where an\r\nembankment about 90 feet in height in treacherous clay had slopes of 1½\r\nto 1 for the upper 30 feet in height, 2 to 1 for the middle 30 feet, and\r\n3 to 1 for the bottom 30 feet. Formation width 28 feet. A calculation of\r\nthe insistent weight per square foot, without a train, at stated heights\r\ngives the following results; taking the weight of the earth at 0·055 of\r\na ton a cubic foot, or 1½ ton a cubic yard, and assuming the worst case,\r\nthat of the earth for the width of the formation, viz., 28 feet, to act\r\nsimply as a column 1 foot square and the load as not being distributed\r\nover the area of the entire base at any point.\r\n\r\n  At the base of the upper 30 feet, 1½ to 1 slopes, it would be about\r\n  1·65 ton per square foot.\r\n\r\n  At the base of the middle 30 feet, 2 to 1 slopes, it would be about\r\n  3·30 tons per square foot.\r\n\r\n  At the base of the lower 30 feet, 3 to 1 slopes, it would be about\r\n  4·95 tons per square foot.\r\n\r\nIf the weight of 1 foot lineal of the embankment is taken and considered\r\nas equally distributed over the whole area of the base at the 30 feet\r\ndivisions, the strain per square foot would be as follows:\r\n\r\n  At the base of the upper 30 feet, 1½ to 1 slopes, about 1 ton per\r\n  square foot.\r\n\r\n  At the base of the middle 30 feet, 2 to 1 slopes, about 1¾ ton per\r\n  square foot.\r\n\r\n  At the base of the lower 30 feet, 3 to 1 slopes, about 2¼ tons per\r\n  square foot.\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—The actual strain is probably approximate to a mean between\r\n  the two values, and is nearer the latter than the former.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why the varying slope system should not be adopted in\r\nembankments of clay or soil having considerable powers of cohesion, as\r\nthe expense of trimming the slopes is very little more than making them\r\nto a straight line. To trim a slope to an elliptical, parabolic, or\r\ncycloidal curve would be a needless refinement requiring a template;\r\nmoreover, the surface is better when it consists of straight lines,\r\nprovided that at the junction of any two inclinations the point of\r\nmeeting is sufficiently rounded to prevent a lodgment of water. In\r\ncuttings in non-weathering tenacious soil the upper part might be left\r\nat a steep slope for 5 or 6 feet from the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the depth of a cutting or the height of an embankment\r\naffects the stability of the slopes, but some soils are so weak that an\r\nembankment of even little height will not be at rest until the toe of\r\nthe slope is supported. If the slopes were not pressed out the earth in\r\nthe central portion of an embankment would stand at any weight less than\r\nthat which would crush it when in its weakest condition; therefore, as\r\nthe load increases downwards it is a logical deduction that the slope\r\nshould be flatter as it approaches the base. In slips the form generally\r\nassumed in soils having considerable cohesive power nearly approaches\r\nthat of a parabolic curve, which shows that a straight slope is not the\r\ncorrect one in tenacious soil, and theory confirms it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of cuttings of considerable depth, apart from the question\r\nof the best form of slope, in order to lessen the velocity of the\r\nsurface water and the extent of a slip, and cause supported weight upon\r\nthe slopes, they can be divided by broad terraces or benchings, about 6\r\nfeet in width, and at vertical distances of 15 to 20 feet, upon which\r\ncan be impermeable catchwater drains. It is important not to allow a\r\nflow in a straight line or nearly so, as the velocity of the water may\r\nerode the slope. If the nature of the earth and its resistance to\r\nerosion will allow, the benches or steps should be abrupt, in order to\r\ncause the greatest resistance and deviation from a direct discharge. The\r\nslopes of the catchwater drains may require to be covered in a flood\r\ndistrict or one having a heavy rain or snowfall.—_Vide_ Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nIn excavating a cutting in soil likely to slip, care should be taken\r\nthat the surfaces are not strained by lumps being left upon them which\r\nare only retained by reason of the cohesion of the earth, as they will\r\ncause weak places less able to bear any pressure brought upon the slopes\r\nthrough the sides being deprived of continuity of support. Therefore, in\r\nsuch cases, the slopes should always be rough trimmed as quickly as\r\npossible after the gullet has been excavated. Also when the slope of a\r\ncutting is furrowed so that its surface consists of separate and\r\nunsupported masses of earth clinging to it, continuity of support is\r\ndestroyed and the earth is more exposed to meteorological dissipation;\r\nand in non-cohesive soils such as sandy or gravelly earth, in which\r\nespecially a straight and uncut surface is of importance, movement is\r\nincited. Therefore, when it is found necessary to insert open trenches\r\nin a slope, they should be at right angles to its foot, and the inserted\r\nmaterial should be well packed so as to support the sides and to\r\ninterfere as little as possible with the slope. Even in clay soils or\r\nany having considerable cohesion, trenches _diagonally or transversely_\r\ncut in the surface are generally inexpedient as disturbing and\r\ndestroying the continuity of support of the surface and increasing its\r\nexposure to the action of the weather; and although they may be\r\ntemporarily effectual as drains, such division of the inclined face\r\ncannot but induce a disunited condition which will at once be apparent\r\nshould the trench become choked and it miscarry as a drain; and a\r\ntemporary failure may so destroy the existing delicate equilibrium as to\r\ncause movement. Such trenches should be regarded with suspicion, as any\r\nstability caused by their draining or conducting away water may be\r\neffected at the cost of continuity of support, the deterioration of the\r\nresistance of the soil to weather, and the impairment of its frictional\r\nand cohesive properties. If placed upon a slope at right angles to the\r\nformation the preceding objections are removed.\r\n\r\nIt may become necessary to excavate or trim a slope to a steeper\r\ninclination than that which would otherwise be adopted and is considered\r\nto be its angle of repose, in order to widen a railway between the\r\nfences, or enlarge a station. Then, pre-eminently the question of the\r\neffects of a slip demand attention. The great majority of railway\r\nstations are located prior to the commencement of, or as the works\r\nprogress, but additional accommodation which, for reasons of economy\r\nmust proceed _pari passu_ with the development of a district, is usually\r\nrequired some time after a railway has been opened for public traffic,\r\nand it may be imperatively necessary to confine the works within the\r\nboundaries of the land originally purchased. Consideration of the\r\nseveral chapters in this book will recall to the mind the chief points\r\nto be regarded. Fortunately, stations are seldom placed in deep cuttings\r\nor upon high embankments; but frequently when a station is opened,\r\nhouses will be erected around it, thus causing any movement of the\r\nground to be of serious moment and dangerous. Assuming the railway must\r\nbe widened within the original fences, the position of the toe of the\r\nslope is fixed, and also that of the top of the slope. The questions\r\nthen in the case of a cutting are principally:—\r\n\r\n1. Will the slope be too precipitous for the earth to stand at one\r\ninclination?\r\n\r\n2. Can it be made sufficiently steep for 5 or 6 feet from the top to\r\nobtain an inclination for the lower portion at which it will have\r\npermanent stability?\r\n\r\n3. Can the earth be made to repose if the face is evenly protected under\r\ncircumstances 1 and 2?\r\n\r\n4. Is it necessary to erect a retaining wall to a distance a few feet\r\nfrom the original surface of the ground?\r\n\r\n5. If a wall be necessary, what should be its lowest height consistent\r\nwith the stability of the unsupported inclined earth above it?\r\n\r\nProvided there is no appreciable superincumbent weight to be borne\r\nnearer than 10 feet from the top of the slope, and that the foundations\r\nof a building are at a considerable depth in the ground, and the surface\r\nand back drainage waters properly controlled, no retaining wall may be\r\nrequired, assuming the original inclination under ordinary conditions to\r\nbe proved to be the permanent slope of stability; but should the\r\ndistance of the face of a building from the toe of the slope after\r\nwidening be insufficient to allow of the original slope being adopted, a\r\nretaining wall will be necessary, its height being chiefly governed by\r\nthe proximity of any building, and the necessity of nearly maintaining\r\nthe originally established steepest slope of repose in the case of any\r\nunsupported earth. The advantage of a sufficient cess in such a case is\r\nthat it makes provision against deterioration of the surface, and causes\r\nan imaginary slope of the same inclination as the original slope to be\r\ncontained within the space between the face of the building and that of\r\nthe retaining wall at formation level. In sandy or loose soil if any\r\nbuildings or wells near the site show signs of cracking, the excavation\r\nshould at once be stopped to see what preventive measures are requisite,\r\nand pumping water out of a trench may be dangerous. Any retaining wall\r\nin such a position should be erected in short lengths, so that the earth\r\nand foundations are exposed to the weather as little as practicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  NOTES UPON THE PRESERVATION OF THE FOOT OF A SLOPE.—VARIOUS METHODS OF\r\n    COVERING AND SUPPORTING A SLOPE.—PROTECTION FROM SNOW-DRIFTS.—THE\r\n    FORMATION WIDTH OF CUTTINGS AND EMBANKMENTS.—THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS\r\n    OF VIBRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe protection of the toe of a slope is of importance, as it is usually\r\nthe most vulnerable and the weakest part. When the earth is of the same\r\ncharacter, the quantity of water is usually greater at the lowest level\r\nthan above it, and the stability of the soil in its vicinity is\r\ntherefore lessened. In clay soils this softening action at the base may\r\ncause a slip and probably can only be prevented by reducing the\r\npercolation by surface drainage, which has been referred to in Chapter\r\nIV.; the matter under consideration being the counteraction of movement\r\nin the toe by other means than draining, although combined with it, such\r\nas by—\r\n\r\n1. An impervious retaining wall with a pervious backing of ashes, gravel\r\nor sand, and ample weep-holes, at the foot of a slope, which, by\r\npreference, should be of Portland cement concrete, a more homogeneous\r\nmaterial than brickwork or masonry, as it has no joints, and is\r\nparticularly to be preferred for retaining walls in clay soils, as it\r\napproaches in a greater degree the condition of air-tightness and that\r\nof equal resistance.\r\n\r\n2. By a pervious wall or counterfort of gravel, burnt ballast, hard\r\nchalk, rubble, strutted timber framework, or a covering of other firm\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nIn both the preceding cases, to ensure stability and to prevent any\r\nprotective works being pushed forward, the foundations must be below the\r\nformation or ground level. To lessen sliding action the foundation\r\nshould incline at right angles to the face, and should have a batter\r\neither for the whole width or for a distance not less than about\r\none-third to one-half of the bottom thickness in the case of low\r\nretaining walls. A wall having a steep batter upon each face, and\r\ntherefore a wide base as compared with its area, causes the centre of\r\ngravity to be at a greater distance from the exposed face, and therefore\r\nthe resistance to overturning is increased; but care must be taken that\r\nit does not slide forward. A foundation for such a wall upon clay or\r\ntenacious soil is to be preferred, provided there is no upheaval of the\r\nground in front, but it should not be upon a thin stratum, or the latter\r\nmay slide upon another.\r\n\r\nIn towns, or where land is of considerable value, the two sides of a\r\ncutting can be made to support each other, and one of the following\r\nprincipal methods may be adopted.\r\n\r\n1. An invert under the line.\r\n\r\n2. A heavy flat platform, arched on plan or solid throughout, under the\r\npermanent way or formation, to prevent a forward movement of the toe.\r\n\r\n3. Overhead arches and iron struts at intervals to resist and reduce the\r\npressure upon a wall.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation, should a tunnel or covered way be not required, any\r\nsubsidence of the earth may cause the destruction of valuable property,\r\nand the erection of a retaining wall be imperatively necessary from a\r\ndue consideration of prudential construction, and altogether regardless\r\nof the character or condition of the earth or its liability to become\r\nwater-charged. In order to prevent movement of the earth different forms\r\nof support may be required. In some cases, owing to excessive pressure,\r\na counterforted wall with an invert under the permanent way may be\r\nessential, or the invert may be flat and be arched on plan, thus\r\nsupporting the toe of a retaining wall between the intervals, in\r\ncombination with a vertical or inclined pilaster and a front counterfort\r\nsystem, and in addition flat overhead struts of iron or other material\r\nbetween the walls acting as an auxiliary support above the required\r\ntraffic space may have to be adopted where the walls have to sustain\r\nconsiderable thrust, the thickness of the retaining wall being thus\r\nreduced; or a simple retaining wall may be sufficient. A non-jointed\r\nmaterial as Portland cement concrete of equal character is to be\r\npreferred to a mass consisting of hard materials yet incapable of\r\npossessing a joint equal to their strength or durability.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the protection of the toe or lower portion, of a slope by\r\nmeans of a retaining wall, it may be the only effectual support in one\r\ncase, and not succeed in an exposed country without a complete system of\r\nopen or closed drains, and then its adoption may be superfluous. In the\r\nfollowing few paragraphs an endeavour is made to indicate some\r\nsituations in which retaining walls have or have not been completely\r\nsuccessful when erected for such purpose.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is most important that ample provision be made for draining\r\nthe back of the walls, for if the egression of the surface waters be\r\nobstructed, they must accumulate and cause hydrostatic pressure, soften\r\nthe lower portion of the earth, thereby failing to partly effect one of\r\nthe objects of their erection, and cease to protect the surface; the\r\nprobable result being that the wall is pushed forward, broken up, or\r\noverturned. The drainage must be regulated by the quantity and velocity\r\nof the flow, and ample weep-holes should be provided to prevent an\r\naccumulation of water at the back. In damp soil there should be one to\r\nabout every three or four superficial yards, and an outlet at each wet\r\nplace, or a wall may not stand. The wall should be backed with a\r\nfiltering medium such as coarse gravel, hard ashes, ballast, and no\r\nretentive earth should be used. In clay earths a retaining wall should\r\nalways have a dry porous backing, as it not only reduces any pressure\r\ndue to a head of water, but also allows of the earth swelling without\r\naffecting the stability of the wall, as it probably would if the clay\r\nrested against the back of the wall.\r\n\r\nRetaining or breast walls are particularly useful in loose soil having\r\nno cohesion, _i.e._, those of a sandy character or consisting of very\r\nsmall grains, and which upon saturation by water or by the action of its\r\nflow become in an unstable state or one of actual movement; in such, a\r\ncase not only is it requisite to protect the surface of a slope, but\r\nsupport at the toe is indispensable. In cohesive soil, such as clay or\r\nclay marls, surface protection, combined with systematic and thorough\r\ndrainage, may be all that is required to make a slope stable, and the\r\nerection of an impervious or solid high wall be unnecessary, always\r\nprovided the earth cannot slide from being superimposed upon an inclined\r\nstratum. In fact, retaining walls in retentive soil have been found to\r\ninduce a slip, because they neither drain the earth nor prevent the\r\nadditional impregnation of water, and they have consequently been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIn countries where floods or very heavy and sudden rainfall, frost and\r\nsnow quickly succeed, masonry or dry stone retaining walls at the foot\r\nof a slope soon become impaired, and require constant supervision and\r\ncareful maintenance, and cannot be considered as economically or\r\ngenerally effectual; and should the earth settle, as they are\r\ncomparatively solid they will not follow any subsidence of the surface;\r\ntherefore cracks occur and water accumulates in the hollows, the slope\r\nhas no longer uniform support, a localization of the egression of water\r\nis caused, owing to the fissures in the wall inducing a flow, and the\r\nwall becomes a cause of a slip instead of a protection against movement.\r\nShould such a wall bulge after it has been restored to the condition of\r\nbeing a continuous support, its forward movement may be arrested by the\r\nerection of counterforts with an inclined face in front from 10 to 30\r\nfeet apart according as weak places exist, having joints at right angles\r\nto the batter; and this is, perhaps, the cheapest and quickest remedy,\r\nbut the slope must be carefully drained and the number of weep-holes be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nIn order not to obstruct, but induce the through drainage of water,\r\nretaining walls to prevent slips have been erected, consisting of arches\r\nturned upon piers, the intervening space being dry walling which allows\r\na free flow of water, the idea being to afford the necessary support\r\nwithout interfering with the drainage. In some cases, as it tends to\r\ncondense the soil, weighting the toe of the slope may prevent movement,\r\nand on the side of a hill weight and mass, apart from slope protection\r\nor drainage, must be provided to arrest a slip or prevent further\r\nmovement, either by means of a continuous wall, or by the addition of\r\nfrequent counterforts, 5 or 6 feet in width, to an existing wall, if\r\nspace permits, the back and front having a considerable batter: the\r\ncentre of gravity of such a mass being low and the base large,\r\noverturning is improbable. Forward movement can be also guarded against\r\nby deep foundations, and as the earth will rest on the inside they can\r\nhave a flatly inclined base sloping towards the cutting, as it will tend\r\nto prevent overturning, the depth of the foundations at the face being\r\ntwo or three times that at the back. Such a structure can hardly be\r\ncalled a wall, being really an extensive and massive concrete toe.\r\n\r\nPerhaps generally the most economical and secure way of preventing\r\nmovement is to erect a low Portland cement concrete wall at the toe of a\r\nslope with a considerable batter; or to cut a trench at formation level\r\noutside the line of the slope, and to shore it by means of old sleepers\r\nstrutted at intervals when better and durable material cannot be readily\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe chief object of a protection at the toe in clay soils is to prevent\r\nthe bottom of a slope being softened by a lodgment of water, or fissured\r\nby heat or drought; this may be effected without a wall; but in the case\r\nof sand or fine granular earth cuttings liable to become quicksand,\r\nsupport at the base is absolutely necessary, and the best way to prevent\r\nmovement may be to erect a breast retaining wall at the toe a few feet\r\nin height, say 3 to 5 feet, the backing being of dry porous material\r\nsuch as ashes, coarse gravel, or broken stone, increasing according to\r\nthe depth or height of the earthwork and quantity of water, the\r\nthickness being more than sufficient to contain the drainage waters, and\r\nnot less than 1 foot 6 inches, in order that it may act as a filter and\r\ndrain the slope, &c., so as to lessen the percolation of water.\r\nSheet-piling and a backing of rubble acting as a drain 2 or 3 feet\r\nsquare, or a strutted timber duct, both made out of old sleepers, have\r\nbeen used with this object in quicksand where water rapidly percolated\r\nto and accumulated at the base. Instability of the toe may also be\r\nprevented by covering it with layers of gravel, but one of the reasons\r\nthat may cause a gravel counterfort to fail in loose porous soil is that\r\nsand or mould may be washed through the interstices in the stones\r\nforming the gravel; hence a more impermeable covering is to be\r\nrecommended in such a case.\r\n\r\nA toe of rammed coarse gravel or broken stone may supply the required\r\nsupport in the case of coarse and fine sand, when the latter is alone\r\nmovable. Experiments have shown that sand rammed in layers of about 5\r\ninches and earth mould 2 inches in thickness give the best results. The\r\nless the weight is increased by ramming the more solid the original\r\nearth. Brushwood or fascine work weighted with gravel, stone or broken\r\nbricks, and stone pitching can also be used for sandy soils, but a\r\nfiltering layer must cover the sand, or the latter will be eroded.\r\nCounterforts of well-rammed natural earth may be sufficient provided the\r\nsoil is firm and is made compact and uniform in texture. In otherwise\r\nstable soil, when it is known that a sand vein is the cause of a slip\r\nbecause of water percolating through it, it should be raked out as\r\ndeeply as practicable if not too large, and the space be filled with\r\nstones, coarse gravel, or dry material forming an open drain for the\r\nwater to issue without a flow of sand, thereby preventing any\r\naccumulation. When a stratum of shifting sand overlies beds of\r\nconglomerate and gravelly or clayey sand it will be necessary to support\r\nthe lower portion of its slope by a wall. The wettest places in a slope\r\nshould be noted and the surface be turfed or covered, and should the\r\ndepth of the unstable sand exceed 5 or 6 feet, narrow benchings can be\r\nmade 2 or 3 feet in width at every 5 or 6 feet of vertical height to\r\ndivide the flow of water and prevent it following a continuous course.\r\nIt also sometimes happens that two treacherous earths have a stratum of\r\nstable soil between them such as rock; in that event it is advisable to\r\nleave a cess between the bottom of the slope of the upper stratum of\r\nunstable soil and the underlying rock, so as to allow of weighting or\r\nother works to resist movement of the toe.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the adoption of open surface rubble drains upon the\r\nslopes, in Chapter IV., page 78, special reference is made to them as\r\ndrains, and in Chapter VI., pages 111, 112, an objection is examined;\r\nbut they are generally effective if cut at right angles to the formation\r\nand not diagonally or transversely. When a slip is repaired by replacing\r\nthe slipped earth when dried and rammed between such drains, it should\r\nbe determined whether it would be better to cover the slope or increase\r\nthe number of drainage channels. A simpler remedy is the insertion of a\r\ndry rubble lining on the surface of the original ground upon which a\r\nslip has occurred, and the restoration of the slope by means of firm\r\nearth or rammed and dried slipped soil; but the system of rammed earth\r\ncounterforts, although it has succeeded when effected during the dry\r\nseason, the earth being wetted sufficiently to make it cohesive by\r\nramming, will not succeed in wet or winter weather, as the soil cannot\r\nthen be consolidated by ramming operations, for it will be overcharged\r\nwith water from the effects of rain, frost, or snow. Fair or summer\r\nweather is required to ensure success.\r\n\r\nShould it be considered advisable, in addition to the erection of rammed\r\nearth counterforts to a height of from one-third to one-half of that of\r\nan embankment, a porous layer or wall of broken stone can be inserted\r\nbetween the slipped material, which is not touched, so that the waters\r\ncan filter away through it and the slope be restored; and the\r\ncounterfort have a channel at its base, in order to prevent a lodgment\r\nof water, to drain the slipped earth and the embankment, and to prevent\r\nthe counterfort becoming saturated. This method may be insufficient in\r\nany but comparatively firm soil, and it may be necessary to make a\r\ntrench at the toe of the slope having its base 2 or 3 feet below the\r\nseat of the slip or firm ground, it being filled with rock chippings,\r\nshingle, gravel, burnt ballast, broken bricks, ashes, coarse clean sand,\r\nor other material having equable frictional stability and particles that\r\nmay for earthwork purposes be considered as insoluble in water, and\r\ntherefore that form stable masses and yet act as drains; and to drain\r\nthe slopes by trenches varying in width according to the position and\r\ndepth of cutting, the depth of a trench may be little or have to be such\r\nthat it extends to the solid ground through the slip, or about 50 to 75\r\nper cent. of its depth, which must be determined in each case, may be\r\nsufficient. Such dry stone counterforts may be required at distances\r\nfrom centre to centre of 15 to 66 feet, and are sometimes placed in the\r\nsame right line and even through an embankment, and are connected with a\r\ndrain sufficiently deep to prevent any lodgment of water at the centre\r\nof the base of the embankment or near the foot of a slope.\r\n\r\nWith regard to covering a slope of a cutting or embankment, its\r\nprincipal use is to lessen deterioration from meteorological action, to\r\nkeep the ground underneath in an equable condition, to reduce\r\npercolation and make it uniform, to diminish the danger arising from\r\ncracks and fissures caused by heat, evaporation, or drought, to prevent\r\nthe erosion of the surface by a flow of water or the production of\r\nunctuous surfaces, and yet not interfere with effectual drainage.\r\n\r\nIt is known that percolation is decreased by vegetation, and that it is\r\nless through turf than bare ground, but varies greatly according to the\r\nkind of covering, the season of the year, the regular or irregular\r\ndistribution of the rainfall, and other causes. If the surface has to be\r\ncovered with vegetation it should be close, uniform, and vigorous\r\nthroughout the whole year, and nothing fulfils these conditions as well\r\nas grass or turf. The protecting value of turfing earthwork may be\r\njudged from an inspection of fortifications in which steep slopes, deep\r\nditches, and perfect maintenance are a necessity. As a consequence of\r\nthe binding and shielding of the earth by the roots of grasses and\r\nplants, and their protection of the surface, the slopes stand at a\r\nsteeper inclination than they otherwise would, and the system of\r\nclinching the exposed faces of the parapets of earthwork with a layer of\r\nsods laid header and stretcher is found to be a great support.\r\n\r\nIn earth possessing considerable cohesion, such as the clays, provided\r\nthe covering is uniform, grass having comparatively deep roots is not a\r\nparticular advantage, but the closeness of the growth of the plant and\r\nthe unimpaired maintenance of a complete cover is of importance, and the\r\nearth should be disturbed as little as possible so as to prevent any\r\nparticles comprising the soil becoming disintegrated and dissolved. When\r\nit is considered advisable to adopt a covering of grass, plants, shrubs,\r\nor trees, it should be remembered that some grasses, such as the\r\ncouch-grass, are injurious to other plants. To equally cover a slope\r\nwith sods of turf they should be cut to a regular form and depth of\r\nabout 6 inches, and be firmly pressed into their places so as to produce\r\nan even smooth surface. A steep slope or any less than 1 to 1, if of\r\nconsiderable depth, will not give a sufficiently flat surface for grass\r\nto properly grow upon it.\r\n\r\nIn sandy and gravelly ground, as the particles may be considered\r\ninsoluble in water and as possessing no cohesion, grass, if it will\r\ngrow, having deep roots is to be preferred, even if passing through any\r\nearth that has been placed upon a slope, in order to counteract the want\r\nof cohesion by a greater hold in the soil and any peeling of the turf or\r\ntufts forming or becoming detached, rolling down and leaving an unbared\r\nsurface. Bent-grass will usually grow on most sandy soils, and a shrub\r\nknown on the north-east coast of England as the sea buckthorn also\r\nrapidly vegetates, but marine grasses must be used in ground impregnated\r\nwith brackish or sea water. To prevent light sand from being scattered\r\nby the wind or washed away a species of rush (Bot. _Ammophila\r\narundinacea_) has been used in Holland and England, and is found to\r\nflourish in dry soils, and as it has spreading roots which often grow to\r\na length of 20 feet or more it binds the grains of sand. Experience in\r\nHolland has shown that grass upon sea embankments does not grow well or\r\nflourish at a steeper slope than about 6 to 1.\r\n\r\nIn countries where wind storms occur, or the soil is of so light a\r\ncharacter that the passage of a train at considerable speed raises the\r\nearth and moves it as dust, a covering of fine grass indigenous to the\r\ncountry has been found to be a protection and necessary to economical\r\nmaintenance. Planting the white basket willow, or withy, has been\r\nrecommended as a means of preventing slips in loose soil, as the roots\r\nform a network and bind the earth and cover the surface with shrub\r\ngrowth. In damp ground the cuttings need not be planted as deeply as in\r\ndry earth, but of course they will not flourish in all soils. Osiers\r\nhave also been adopted with good results in damp places.\r\n\r\nEmbankments of blown or drift sand, easily moved by the wind, have also\r\nbeen protected and maintained by branches of trees laid horizontally.\r\nThey were placed in regular courses alternately with a stratum of sand,\r\nthe ends projecting over and down the slopes, which were sown with\r\nindigenous plants that it is known will flourish upon it. Great\r\ndifficulty had been experienced in maintaining the embankment until its\r\nsurface was so shielded. Sandy dunes have also been prevented from\r\nslipping and being eroded and destroyed by the sea and wind by reducing\r\nthem to the same line, level, and slope, by filling all openings or\r\ndepressions, or, if curved, by trimming them to a regular exterior and\r\nthe largest radius, and by a covering of fascine work in the exposed\r\nplaces, and in any less exposed situation by planting them with grasses\r\nthat will grow upon such soil, the object being to remove all local\r\nobstruction to wind or wave force and cause equable resistance and\r\nprotection. In France, the drifting of blown sea-sand into cuttings,\r\nwhich not only may interfere with the free traffic but also be a\r\ndestructive agent to the rolling stock, has been prevented by planting\r\npine trees upon the cess.\r\n\r\nIn embankments in loose soil and across valleys, especially if they are\r\nnarrow and deep, repeated gusts of wind which have their maximum effect\r\nupon a flat surface at right angles to it, will produce a hammering\r\naction upon the windward side, and when the velocity is very great, upon\r\nthe leeward portion there may even be a partial vacuum created by the\r\nwind rushing over the top of an embankment. An actual maximum momentary\r\npressure of wind of 80 lbs. per square foot was registered at the\r\nLiverpool Observatory in 1869, equal to a hammering action of 0·55 lb.\r\nper square inch. It is here referred to in order to show that in exposed\r\nvalleys the surface of all embankments of light soil should be covered\r\nso that the particles cannot be blown away at the top or from the\r\nslopes, for a force of 80 lbs. per square foot nearly equals the weight\r\nof a cubic foot of dry open sand which cannot be taken as weighing much\r\nmore than 90 to 100 lbs.\r\n\r\nIf seed be sown upon a slope it is evident that it should be of uniform\r\nkind in order to create a general equable condition, and the growth of\r\nall rank vegetation should be prevented, for an unevenly protected or\r\ncovered surface will promote a localization of disturbing agencies, and\r\nespecially in treacherous ground when it has been covered, neither the\r\nsurface nor the turf should be allowed to be broken.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases where slips may be expected, soiling with mould or top\r\ndressing, and sowing the slopes may be sufficient, and turfing in others\r\nof small extent; but in retentive soluble soil, a filtering layer under\r\nthe turf may be required, so as to prevent spreading, particularly near\r\nthe toe of a slope; however, in mountainous or hilly districts,\r\nexperience seems to indicate that it is advisable to allow earthwork to\r\nbecome consolidated by the natural effect of rain and atmosphere before\r\nfinally trimming or covering the slopes: on the contrary it may be\r\nadvisable, especially in treacherous ground, to trim and cover with\r\nmould, sow, turf, plant, or cover the slopes as soon as possible after\r\nthey are excavated or deposited, in order to protect soluble soil from\r\nrain, frost, or snowstorms consequent upon the wet season being near. Of\r\ncourse, when experience shows that slips are improbable, the slopes can\r\nremain bare and simply be trimmed, and a covering of grass be left to\r\ntime to effect, and this is now the frequent practice. Should settlement\r\nbe expected or be unavoidable, the face protection can be so made that\r\nit will not be disturbed or broken. In such a case a short, straight\r\nslope with a flat inclined berm or cess, the length of the slope being\r\ndivided into three or four short continuous straight portions, has been\r\nadopted with success. Should sowing or planting the slopes be considered\r\nas too slow in producing a covering, experiments can be made by mixing\r\navailable soils, or with one earth; and by exposing the mixture or earth\r\nto the deteriorating weather influences it will have to resist, the best\r\nprotective covering to be readily obtained can be discovered.\r\n\r\nRespecting the planting of saplings or shrubs, laws have been enacted to\r\ncompel the planting of saplings and trees upon certain lands as a\r\nprotection against landslips, and it seems to be generally acknowledged\r\nthat trees, particularly when in plantations, are a protection, as they\r\nnot only absorb moisture and bind the earth with their roots, but also\r\nlessen any flow of water down the steep sides of a cutting or\r\nembankment; and instances have been recorded in which trees have been\r\nshown to preserve the alluvial banks of rivers, as when they were felled\r\nthe sides were eroded, or weakened, probably by the increase of moisture\r\nand exposure, with the result that the channel became widened. The\r\nsystematic planting of live slips of poplar or willow has been found to\r\neffectually protect soft banks of rivers, washed by the stream, against\r\nweathering and erosion. Also in treacherous clay marly-soils, in which\r\nslips of earth were numerous, acacia trees have afforded a good\r\nprotection, as their widely spreading roots conduced to hold the soil\r\ntogether, and their foliage and branches gently regulated and lessened\r\nthe effects of rain and prevented quick infiltration into the earth.\r\nHowever, care must be taken that the roots do not open or strain the\r\nsurface of the ground by force of the wind or otherwise, and increase\r\nand localize percolation; but they tend to prevent cracking and\r\nfissuring of the surface in clay and argillaceous earth, and form a\r\nprotection against the effects of the sun’s rays and drought.\r\nQuick-growing trees should be selected having large and deep roots and\r\nabundant foliage, especially in non-cohesive earths. Acacia and birch\r\ntrees appear to give satisfactory results. Unless in exceptional\r\nsituations, such as to protect a cutting from drifts of snow, or where\r\nfrom local experience they are proved to act upon the earth as a\r\nholdfast, it is questionable whether the indiscriminate and\r\nnon-systematic planting of saplings or bushes is not more likely to aid\r\ndisruption than promote stability, and, as a rule, other and less\r\nexpensive means of protecting a slope are to be preferred unless a\r\nuniform covering by trees or shrubs is practicable, whether over a small\r\nor large unstable area. Isolated trees should not be allowed within the\r\nfences of a cutting, although if just outside the toe of the slope of an\r\nembankment the roots may serve as a buttress, and therefore be\r\nbeneficial. Although in some dyke embankments in North Europe no trees\r\nor plants are allowed to grow upon them, so that any deterioration of\r\nthe mass maybe clearly and quickly apparent; in Holland the defensive\r\ncovering varies according to the character of the earth, fascines,\r\nwattling, sodding, a gravel coating, benching at the top of a slope and\r\nplanting it with reeds to protect an embankment from erosion and wash\r\ncaused by traffic; pitching, plank facing, and sheet planking at the\r\ntoe, when the ground is very soft, have all been used with success. On\r\nsilty land willows generally grow rapidly, and when planted a little\r\ndistance from the toe of the land slope in enclosure embankments they\r\nare found to protect the ground. In some situations it may be necessary\r\nto protect an embankment against boring by burrowing animals or\r\ncrustacea. Clay and clay loams are soils especially liable to be\r\nburrowed. Usually as the quantity of sand increases, the boring\r\ndecreases; a coating of hard ashes may afford the required protection:\r\nhowever, in the case of crustacea, local experience alone can indicate\r\nthe best protection, probably nothing less than stone pitching may\r\nsuffice, but as a general rule in this country, no precautions are\r\nnecessary; in warmer regions it may be otherwise.\r\n\r\nWith reference to fissures in a slope which tend to produce slips as\r\nthey allow water to trickle down them, which must either be absorbed by\r\nthe earth or find an outlet; a slippery surface is thus created and the\r\ntenacity and continuity of the soil impaired or destroyed; separation\r\nalso takes place in non-homogeneous earths such as boulder clay and in\r\nembankments formed of rock and earth tipped together. It is practically\r\nimpossible to fill or pun every fissure that may appear in a cutting or\r\nan embankment, but as there are generally places where slips are more\r\nprobable than others, it may be advantageous in treacherous soils to\r\nadopt a regular system of filling the fissures, especially before the\r\nwet season commences.\r\n\r\nCoverings can also be made of a thin coating of burnt ballast, hard\r\nchalk, or gravel, which will reduce the number of cracks or crevices, or\r\na mattress of fascine work can be used at the toe of the slope in\r\nsubmerged work, but care should be taken that the mattresses overlap and\r\nthat there are no open places between them, or, instead of being a\r\nprotection they will then be a source of danger by conducting water\r\nbetween the joints; for this reason, as with any other material having\r\nloose openings, it is advisable to use them over a continuous surface so\r\nthat percolation may be uniform and not simply for weak places or for\r\nthe purpose of repairing a slip in an earth embankment. The chief aim in\r\nfascine work is to thoroughly bind the work together so that it is of\r\nequal strength in all directions, and a little time after construction\r\nshould be allowed before deposition in order that the material may\r\nsettle, as an even surface is important. The most durable material\r\nshould be used in making a fascine covering, willow being the best, or\r\nit may require constant renewing. Alder, aspen, and the best available\r\nbrushwood are also employed, and straw and ordinary matting for shallow\r\nembankments, say up to 8 feet in height, which lasts only six to twelve\r\nmonths. The best time for cutting should be locally ascertained, and\r\nwhen they commence to deteriorate after being hewn, generally from three\r\nmonths to a year, depending upon the season in which they are cut, &c.,\r\n&c. In England, thorn switches have been used in lengths of 5 to 6 feet,\r\ntied up with tarred rope in bundles having a diameter of about 1 foot,\r\nevery endeavour being made to bind and interweave them. Care must be\r\ntaken that the mattresses are well loaded or they will float; the\r\nloading should commence at the centre, and be equally continued in all\r\ndirections, as that has been found to be the best method; they should be\r\nmade to sink evenly if they have to be lowered through water, and they\r\nmust be prevented from curling up at the edges. The props which fix them\r\nmust not be too close to the border, or near the centre, as then the\r\nextremities will be torn away or bent upwards. The system of fascine\r\nwork may be very useful for protecting sandy and soft foundations in\r\nsuch situations, to prevent slips in the slopes of an embankment and in\r\nproviding a firm bed, and also for making training banks, groynes, and\r\nspurs, for correcting and directing a current in a desired channel, and\r\nto secure freedom from slips in a river-bank. Depending upon the degree\r\nof looseness of the sand or sandy bed, loaded fascine mattresses will\r\nassume a slope of from 1 to 1 TO 5 to 1 if allowed to sink in the bed,\r\nand after they have settled and reached the angle of repose which the\r\naction of water will effect; the large number of structures standing\r\nupon them for many years in considerable depths of water proves, when\r\nthey are properly made, that they are to be trusted in comparatively\r\nunexposed situations.\r\n\r\nA covering of stone pitching may be necessary, but in unsubmerged work\r\nit has some disadvantages for, having joints, it allows unequal\r\npenetration of water through them and impedes the equal discharge of\r\nwater from the earth, although its weight is a recommendation as it\r\nopposes and may balance a pressure of water behind the slope. However,\r\nunless it is bedded upon a layer of soil of equal permeability, such as\r\ngravel laid upon a nearly impermeable bed of clay, which should always\r\nbe mixed with sand to prevent it fissuring and bursting by heat or\r\nwater, so as to convey the water that has percolated and also that which\r\nexudes through the slope; it may cause a localization of the flow, and,\r\nexcept in peculiar cases and provided the slopes are covered, there is\r\nno occasion for pitching if merely used to prevent slips and not\r\nerosion, as obviously weight and a secure protection may be obtained by\r\nother means and at less expense. For the protection of the slopes of\r\nrivers or canals or submerged work the case is different, as then\r\npitching prevents erosion and may be the only secure preservative in\r\nexposed situations, although generally the most expensive. The pitching\r\nshould rest upon a bed of permeable material, and this layer should have\r\na power of suction and distribution more than equal to the quantity of\r\nwater that may penetrate the joints of the pitching; there should be a\r\nbed of impermeable material next to the soil, and in exceptional cases\r\neven two to carry off any water that has percolated, so as to obviate\r\nany lodgment of water, due provision being made for the land drainage\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nSir James Brunlees, Past-President Inst. C.E., found by experiment that\r\nat a slope of 2 to 1 pitching has the greatest resistance to extraction,\r\n_i.e._, it requires a greater effort to extract a brick at that slope.\r\nTaking the slope of 2 to 1 as unity, the relative resistances were found\r\nto be as follows:—\r\n\r\n                           1 to 1 slope 0·71\r\n                           2 to 1 slope 1·00\r\n                           3 to 1 slope 0·97\r\n                           4 to 1 slope 0·66\r\n\r\nThe resistances at 2 to 1 and 3 to 1 are practically the same.\r\n\r\nShould it be determined to pitch the lower part only of a slope, in\r\norder to prevent slips, the pitching must continue to such a height that\r\na flow of water down the slope is impossible, or it may become detached.\r\nIf the pitching is not rough squared on the joints, but of various\r\nforms, it is preferable that the face having the largest area be laid\r\ndownwards, smaller stones being carefully wedged in between the\r\ninterstices. Any defective execution is usually followed by a falling of\r\nthe stones, and should this happen the surface will be broken and\r\nerosion and slips will ensue. In laying the stones they should be so\r\nplaced that if a few become removed those above or upon the sides will\r\nnot be disturbed, and in loose soil no pitching should be laid until an\r\nembankment has had time to settle and consolidate, which the necessities\r\nof rapid execution may prevent, for however even the pitching may be\r\nwhen first laid, it will settle and become more or less uneven in such\r\nsoil as sand or estuary slake, and every effort should be made to leave\r\nno hole or exposed surface, but to cause a continuous close covering.\r\nFascine mattresses may have to be used in such a situation, as they will\r\nfollow the contour of the slope. Should the slope be subject to\r\nconsiderable wave action, smooth surfaces offering the least frictional\r\nresistance, obviously aid the travel of a wave, which is undesirable,\r\nand provided the embankment is sufficiently strong a rougher surface is\r\nto be desired. Projecting stakes tend to subdivide a wave.\r\n\r\nShould pitching be required to be placed partly upon the face of a\r\ncutting and partly upon the slope of an embankment, as in the case of a\r\ncanal upon sidelong ground, care must be taken that it does not settle\r\nunequally, and provision should be made by setting it upon a pervious\r\nlayer, so that any damming back of drainage waters may be prevented. The\r\nweight of pitching upon a slope affords a counter-pressure to that of\r\nany water in the slopes which may be trying to emerge. Chalk rubble,\r\nalso hard chalk, or gravel has been used in lieu of stone pitching for\r\nprotecting slopes against erosion.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of retaining walls, the preceding may be considered\r\nas the principal means, used separately or in reasonable combination,\r\nfor covering the surface of a slope in a cutting or an embankment.\r\n\r\nA frequent cause of instability of the slopes in countries having severe\r\nwinters is the melting of unequal masses of snow, the result of drifts,\r\nand also from the thawing of a considerable snowfall. The chief\r\npreventive measures against snowdrifts and consequent protection to the\r\nslopes, although not a covering, may be stated to be as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. Locate the line in a naturally sheltered position, which it is most\r\nimprobable can be done throughout its length.\r\n\r\n2. Adopt tunnels, covered or sheltered galleries where the district is\r\nsubject to avalanches or snow-slips.\r\n\r\n3. Prevent drifts by permanent or portable screens such as earth mounds,\r\ntrees, hedges, fences, &c.\r\n\r\n4. Obstruct drifts by having deep trenches some distance from the top of\r\nthe slopes.\r\n\r\n5. Avoid cuttings as much as possible, and make the line upon an\r\nembankment of such a height as to be above the depth of the drift snow\r\nin similar situations.\r\n\r\n6. Construct the embankments from side cutting, instead of cutting, so\r\nthat the trenches may catch the snow before it reaches the railway.\r\n\r\n7. Make the slope much flatter than its angle of repose.\r\n\r\n8. Increase the width of the formation so as to lessen the depth of a\r\ndrift, and to enable a snow-plough to more readily discharge its\r\nexcavation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the preventive measures enumerated.\r\n\r\nNo. 1.—As a rule this can only be practised to a limited extent\r\nconsequent upon traffic requirements and the configuration of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNo. 2.—Shelter-galleries are found to be generally effectual, but\r\nobviously are expensive; they may, however, be the only means to adopt,\r\nas any obstruction to a snow-slip is avoided. The slope of the top of a\r\ncovered or shelter-gallery should not be steeper than that of the hill,\r\nso as to offer no impediment to the free passage of the snow.\r\n\r\nNo. 3.—Experience has proved that permanent screens are to be preferred\r\nto portable shields, and that ultimately they are the more economical.\r\nThe excavated material, either from a cutting, drains or fence-ditches,\r\nis generally used for the earth mounds so as to save expense; their\r\nheight, which is often from 7 to 10 feet, of course is governed by the\r\ngreatest depth of the snowfall, degree of exposure and usual direction\r\nof storms, wind, and drift. Should these vary much, in an open air line\r\nit may be impracticable to entirely shut out or prevent drifts, but the\r\nprotective works will lessen drifting and may reduce it to manageable\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nA simple earth dam is seldom sufficient, owing to the impelling power of\r\nthe wind upon the snow-flakes and the considerable height at which it\r\nacts; therefore, fencing has been fixed in the top of the mound, or\r\ntrees and shrubs planted, also old sleepers have been successful when\r\nsimply closely driven into the surface of the original ground. A screen,\r\nconsisting of one or more rows of trees or shrubs placed at a little\r\ndistance from the top of the slope of a cutting, is that most generally\r\npreferred. It is made either double or single, as may be thought\r\nnecessary. In Germany, hedges of fir trees similar to Christmas trees\r\nhave been found to afford excellent protection. In France, pine trees\r\nplanted upon the cess have effectually prevented serious snowdrifts.\r\n\r\nIn sloping ground, mounds or dams, screens, plantations of trees and\r\nhedges in very exposed places have been insufficient to prevent some\r\ndrifting and accumulation of snow in a cutting, and a mound or fence has\r\nconsequently been erected upon the plateau at the top of the hill a\r\nsufficiently safe distance from its face that snow-slips, which might be\r\nincreased into avalanches, were prevented from reaching the slopes or\r\nformation. A drain should be cut upon the higher side of such a hill-dam\r\nor fence so as to carry away the snow-water upon a thaw, and prevent the\r\nearth becoming in an unstable condition.\r\n\r\nNo. 4.—This system is generally used when an earth mound is also adopted\r\nand it has to be deposited from side cutting. The trench, of course,\r\nshould be on the side of the mound farthest from the main cutting. As a\r\nsnow-catcher it is successful, especially in shallow embankments, for it\r\nnot only retains snow that would otherwise heap, but drains an\r\nembankment.\r\n\r\nNo. 5.—This depends upon the configuration of the country, but as\r\ncuttings act as traps to catch snow, if possible they should be avoided;\r\nand particularly when of little depth, as it is found they quickly\r\nbecome choked, and want as much protection as deeper excavations, and\r\nfrom being more exposed to the cold air, the snow in them becomes caked\r\nand frozen, and requires breaking up before it can be removed.\r\nEmbankments of a height a little above the ground, and the greatest\r\ndepth of the uniform snowfall of the country, are to be preferred.\r\n\r\nNo. 6.—Generally approved, as not only affording an advanced\r\ncatch-trench, but because it acts as a permanent drain.\r\n\r\nNo. 7.—This is a controverted system. Some engineers object to it as\r\nfacilitating the deposition of snowdrifts; others approve, upon the\r\nground that by flattening the slopes the snow can drift freely and will\r\nfall equally upon the formation. The balance of experienced opinion\r\nseems to be rather against the adoption of flattened slopes, unless they\r\nare made very flat, such as from 4 to 1 TO 10 to 1, at which latter\r\nslope snow it is found does not usually accumulate but passes on\r\ndepositing only its general depth: and additional means of protection\r\nare afforded, and appears to indicate that the unaided system is only\r\nwell adapted for countries in which winds of great force are generated,\r\nsuch as the “blizzards” of North America.\r\n\r\nNo. 8.—It is found that increased width of the formation of a cutting is\r\nan advantage, as it retards choking, facilitates clearing operations,\r\nand provides room for shovelling snow from the permanent way, whether\r\neffected by a snow-plough or by manual labour.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the formation width, _i.e._, the width of the bottom of a\r\ncutting or the top of an embankment, and the prevention of slips in\r\nearthwork, ample breadth is necessary in cuttings for the purposes of\r\ndrainage, although less in a rock cutting than in that of ordinary soil,\r\nand the extent of the top of an embankment has some influence in the\r\npromotion of stability. The required width of the formation must be\r\nprincipally regulated by the character of the earth, the amount and\r\nsuddenness of the rainfall, the height of an embankment or depth of a\r\ncutting, the degree of exposure, the exigencies of the traffic, and the\r\nrequired drainage. In wet cuttings the formation should be wider than in\r\ndry earth, and the side ditches should be made larger, especially when\r\nthere is a steep gradient in a long cutting, in order to keep the\r\nformation and the permanent way in as dry a state as possible and aid\r\ntraction, for the coefficient of friction of the wheels of a locomotive\r\nwill then be greater than when the rails are damp and greasy. In cold\r\nclimates the width of the formation is often increased so as to lessen\r\nthe depth of snowdrifts, and to enable a snow-plough or men to more\r\nreadily deposit the excavated snow and clear the track, as has been\r\nreferred to in the immediately preceding pages; and in severe climates\r\nin wet places ample width in cuttings is found necessary, as drains\r\nfrequently have to be cut in them as deep as 4 to 5 feet to afford a\r\nfree flow for and to prevent an accumulation of water. In temperate\r\nclimates the width can be much reduced. When the formation is narrow the\r\nsimple percolation of water through the slopes of an embankment, unaided\r\nby any aqueous action caused by fissures, may gradually saturate the\r\nmass, and as the wider the formation the larger the cross-sectional area\r\nof an embankment, it follows that increased resisting power to\r\ndeterioration is obtained by widening the formation, as there is more\r\nearth to absorb the water.\r\n\r\nA train upon the permanent way will make a force act downwards until it\r\nmeets with sufficient resistance to cause reaction. The direction of the\r\nresolution of these forces is towards a slope, therefore, the farther\r\nthe surface of a slope is from the line of action and reaction, the\r\ngreater is its distance from the disturbing force and the lateral\r\nresistance it receives from the mass. In the case of a solid rock\r\nfoundation and a homogeneous embankment in the same state of\r\nconsolidation throughout its mass, the direction of the forces might be\r\naccurately delineated, but as such a uniformly homogeneous and equable\r\ncondition seldom exists in railway embankments, it cannot be absolutely\r\nsaid that the forces act throughout upon certain lines; however, it is\r\nadvisable to ascertain the probable direction of the forces.\r\n\r\nThe allowance for lateral settlement should be liberal and be regulated\r\nby the nature of the earth, the height of an embankment, and other local\r\nconditions of situation and rainfall that affect earth, many of which\r\nare named in other chapters. It will vary greatly, and may be anything,\r\nfrom 5 per cent. to 100 per cent. additional width of formation. An\r\naddition of from 5 to 10 per cent. of the height of an embankment is\r\nusually sufficient, but in clay sand and such soils an embankment may be\r\nslowly washed away by rain until it has shrunk to half its required\r\nwidth. As an embankment settles or weathers the width of the formation\r\nshould be maintained without having to steepen the slope, widen the top,\r\nor erect a wall upon the formation in order to hold the added earth. The\r\nadditional formation width of embankments is also a provision against\r\nthe effects which the “lurching” of an engine may cause by its weight\r\ntemporarily acting upon one rail, and the pressure to be in the 4 feet\r\n8½ inches gauge at a distance of about 2 feet 6 inches from the centre\r\nof the permanent way. For some distance upon each side of the point of\r\njunction of two high tip heads the top width should be increased, _vide_\r\nChap. IX., and in sidelong ground it is advisable to widen an embankment\r\nmore on the upper side than the lower, as slips seldom occur upon the\r\nhigher side; and in the case of railways, should the lower slope move,\r\nthe rails can be placed towards the hill, and perhaps away from the\r\nslipped portion of the embankment.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the deteriorating influence of vibration as regards the\r\nslope of a cutting or embankment, it is well established that vibration\r\nwill cause movement in a retaining wall which would otherwise be stable,\r\nand that soils possessing considerable powers of cohesion are not so\r\neasily affected by vibration as those of a looser character consisting\r\nof particles having more or less rounded surfaces; but the action of\r\nwater may produce seams in such earths as clay, and create a smooth\r\ngreasy sliding surface upon which any reposing mass may but require the\r\nleast disturbing force, on the principle that the least impact is\r\nsufficient to impart motion to the largest body; such as a man walking\r\nupon it or the tread of an animal, to unbalance the delicate state of\r\nequilibrium. This action may be gradual, continuous, and increasing, as\r\nthe earth will always be subject to changes of weather. On the contrary,\r\nvibration in soils having particles insoluble in water, provided water\r\ndoes not dissolve any cementing material between them, may cause them to\r\nequally settle and become firmer by being pressed together than if they\r\nwere not subject to such operation, and should the particles wedge by\r\nshaking and the slopes be sufficiently flat, vibratory motion may, under\r\nthese circumstances, tend to consolidate certain earths in an\r\nembankment; but not so in the slopes of a cutting which vibration must\r\ndisturb by reason of it agitating and loosening the surface and making\r\nit less dense. For instance, in sandy soils the surface friction on a\r\ncylinder, when sinking operations are not being prosecuted and when the\r\nmaterial is being raised from the interior, is different; the latter\r\nresistance being from 20 to 25 per cent. less than the former,\r\nconsequent upon the disturbance, and although fine, soft drift sand\r\nusually presents greater frictional resistance than firm sand, it\r\nobviously cannot be taken as equal to that of firm sand, as it is\r\nquickly dissipated.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of earth being so very diverse no rules can be deduced,\r\nfor even the effects of such stupendous force as that of earthquake\r\nvibrations vary according to the nature of the ground, however, the\r\nweakening effects of vibration are undoubtedly very considerable. It is\r\nknown that the lateral thrust of earth is thereby much augmented, and,\r\ntherefore, that the strain upon the frictional resistance and the\r\ncohesion of the earth is increased; and experiments have shown that when\r\na wall is nearly strained to the point of overturning, slight vibration\r\nwill quickly destroy the equilibrium, thus demonstrating that it adds to\r\nthe lateral pressure. An analysis of some reliable experiments proves\r\nthis increase to usually range from 10 to 60 per cent., but it is\r\nevident that the practical effect of any increase may be very much\r\ngreater than a mere computation of the increment, for it may supply the\r\nadditional strain, however small, necessary to initiate a movement,\r\nhence the danger.\r\n\r\nAs collateral testimony to the important effects of vibration may be\r\nmentioned:—\r\n\r\nA comparison of the coefficients of friction during motion and those at\r\nthe commencement of movement or of repose.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a nearly vertical face generally assumed, when unshaken\r\nby artificial means, in the bared top earth in a quarry, shallow well,\r\ngravel or sand pit, pond, and even a river-bank or a cliff, which\r\nexperience has proved could not be maintained when subject to vibration.\r\n\r\nThe fact that timber piles, which are chiefly supported by the\r\nfrictional resistance of their surfaces, will not sustain a rolling,\r\n_i.e._, a vibratory, load equal to that of a fixed load, and also that\r\nthe method of driving in soils easily disturbed, such as sand, is also\r\nconsidered as reducing the safe load according to the percussive action\r\nand frequent vibration caused by a pile-driver, whether worked by steam,\r\nhand, or by means of an explosive substance. As further proof may be\r\nnamed that in pile-driving, especially in open soil, piles continually\r\ndriven penetrate the earth considerably quicker and easier than if\r\ndriven at intervals, as the latter system allows the soil to settle\r\nround them and the loosening and friction destroying effects of\r\nvibration are lessened.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made by Mr. J. A. Longridge, M. Inst. C.E., for Mr. G.\r\nR. Stephenson, Past-President Inst. C.E., in Morecambe Bay, England,\r\nshowed that by vibration the bearing power of driven timber piles was\r\nreduced to one-fourth or one-fifth of that when subject to a steady\r\nnon-vibratory load.\r\n\r\nIts deleterious effect on the structure of such a solid substance as\r\niron, &c., particularly when it is loaded beyond its elastic limit.\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed that a substance is broken sooner when a load is\r\nintermittingly imposed than when the same load is permanently placed\r\nupon a structure.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Professor Stokes, 1849; M. Phillips, 1855; M.\r\nRenaudot, 1861; M. Bresse, 1866; and recently of Dr. Winkler and others,\r\nshow that the increase of the intensity of strain consequent upon the\r\ndynamic effect of a suddenly-applied moving load may be as much as 33\r\nper cent. more than that of the computed statical pressure.\r\n\r\nThe fact that in masonry piers of considerable height and small\r\ndimensions, as in piers of viaducts, the vibration caused by trains\r\nloosens the brickwork or masonry and necessitates frequent repairs.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the particles of all solid bodies may be in a state of\r\ncontinuous vibration and motion, though there may be no means of\r\nrendering their motion visible, has not been refuted by deductive\r\nreasoning; but, on the other hand, it is in accord with the theory that\r\n“motion communicates itself among material bodies, and is never lost;\r\nwhen it appears to be so, it in fact only passes from the moving body\r\ninto other bodies which are at rest, or are endued with a less velocity,\r\nand at length it becomes insensible in consequence of its enormous\r\ndiffusion. In fact, motion can only be destroyed by motion; resistances\r\nand friction disperse it, but do not destroy it.”\r\n\r\nThe laws of statics and dynamics are well established, and are fully\r\ndescribed in many admirable works upon mechanical philosophy; so far as\r\nthe subject of this book is concerned that which is required to be\r\nanswered is the question. Have the deleterious effects of vibration upon\r\nearthwork in various conditions been determined so as to be of practical\r\nvalue?\r\n\r\nNot by experiment upon a large scale, nor is it probable that they will\r\nbe; but they have been deduced from experience, reasonable inference,\r\nand experiments on a small scale, as has been before mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe effect of vibration is usually more marked in cuttings than in\r\nembankments, although it may nearly approach when they are of little\r\ndepth or height: because a train in a cutting is contained within the\r\narea excavated, whereas in an embankment it is without the area\r\ndeposited. In a cutting vibration commences upon the formation level and\r\nthe toe of the slopes, the latter the most vulnerable parts and those\r\nmost strained. In an embankment it proceeds through the formation to the\r\nbase and the toes of the slopes which are necessarily the most distant.\r\nOn the other hand, the material in an embankment is generally in a\r\nlooser and lighter condition, and therefore more inclined to move and to\r\nsuffer from vibration. It may also be greater upon one side consequent\r\nupon the “lurching” of the engine and carriages.\r\n\r\nObviously, vibration is increased with the speed and weight of a train;\r\nprobably a short, heavy train travelling at high speed causes a more\r\ndeleterious effect than a long heavy train travelling at a slow speed:\r\nalso the higher an embankment or the deeper a cutting the greater the\r\narea of the cross section. Assume a train weighs 100 tons, and the\r\nweight of the earth is 112 lbs a cubic foot, or 0·05 of a ton; it might\r\nbe considered that the effects of vibration would be less as the areas\r\nincreased. Consider the formation to be 18 feet in width and the slopes\r\n1½ to 1, the respective areas of cross section would be as follows:—\r\n\r\n ───────────┬───────────────────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────\r\n   Height.  │         Area.         │ Weight of │ Weight of │ Ratio of\r\n    Feet.   │                       │    the    │the Train. │the Weight\r\n            │                       │Embankment.│   Tons.   │ of 1 Foot\r\n            │                       │ Tons per  │           │ Lineal of\r\n            │                       │  Lineal   │           │    an\r\n            │                       │   Foot.   │           │Embankment\r\n            │                       │           │           │  to the\r\n            │                       │           │           │ Weight of\r\n            │                       │           │           │the Train.\r\n ───────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────\r\n            │Square  Lineal   Ton.  │           │           │\r\n            │ Feet.

Merely comparing the\r\nweight of a train with that of an embankment, and assuming that the\r\nresults of vibration at the same rate of speed are so governed is\r\nincorrect, for the effect of vibration at the formation level is not\r\nregulated by the height of an embankment or the depth of a cutting. The\r\nweight of a train may bear a very small relation to that of the quantity\r\nof earth slipped, yet the soil may have gradually become in such a state\r\nof delicate equilibrium that at last the least vibration will destroy\r\nit, even a little of the top soil falling upon the slope; and it\r\nfrequently occurs that a slip commences by the detachment of a few small\r\nlumps and increases until it becomes of serious dimensions; therefore,\r\nthe area of a cutting or embankment cannot necessarily be considered as\r\nreducing vibration although the source of disturbance may be more\r\ndistant; but, of course, the heavier the mass the greater the weight and\r\nspeed required to cause the whole to vibrate.\r\n\r\nLighthouses and such exposed works being constantly subject to\r\nvibration, the experience gained through their behaviour may be\r\nconsidered as indicating the direction in which the stability of\r\nstructures in analogous situations has to be sought. It is generally\r\nagreed that it favours weight and bulk, as they are unchangeable, and\r\nshows that although the form, execution, and the material may be\r\nperfect, a light fabric will gradually be deteriorated by constant\r\ntremor and vibratory motion, at length culminating in the loosening and\r\nseparation of the parts.\r\n\r\nExcept from actual experiment in each case, it is impossible to\r\ndetermine the greatest weight of and the speed at which a train should\r\nbe allowed to travel so as to prevent any deleterious effect from\r\nvibration, and the circumstances are so various that a practical rule\r\ncannot be deduced, except by assuming conditions from experience alone,\r\nwhich would so modify a formula as to make it show any desired result,\r\nand cause it to be regarded as too complaisant to be trusted. Perhaps\r\nthe best test of the effects of vibration that any earthworks can\r\nreceive is when a temporary railway is laid upon the formation or cess\r\nfor the carriage of materials, and in a lesser degree a steam excavator,\r\nas the weight and vibratory action may show the weak places in a\r\ncutting, or so shake portions of an embankment that should the earth be\r\nunstable a slip will soon occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  EARTHWORKS IN OR UPON SIDELONG GROUND.—SOME INSECURE\r\n    CONDITIONS.—PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES.—EMBANKMENTS UPON SOFT\r\n    GROUND.—EMBANKMENTS COMPOSED OF SOFT EARTH.—THE PROMOTION OF\r\n    STABILITY AND CONSOLIDATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to earthworks in or upon sidelong ground, the configuration\r\nof the surface conduces to a movement of the hill-slope of a cutting,\r\nand the centre of gravity of an embankment is not in the middle, and in\r\na narrow embankment may be outside the central portion, the tendency,\r\ntherefore, is for the slope of an embankment on the upper or hill-side\r\nto assume a steeper inclination than that on the lower, as the earth is\r\ntipped against the inclined ground until the point is reached where a\r\nperpendicular erected upon the surface of the ground cuts the top of the\r\ninside slope. This slope, if protected from weathering, might be allowed\r\nto stand at the inclination at which it remains when tipped, and be\r\nsimply trimmed and covered; but the toe of the slope on the lower or\r\nvalley side is especially likely to slip, and therefore, every\r\nprecaution should be taken to prevent movement. A retaining wall is a\r\ncertain protection, benching the ground, weighting the foot of the\r\nslope, dividing it into benches about 10 to 15 feet apart, varying in\r\nwidth from 5 feet and increasing according to the depth; the benches\r\nhaving sufficient inclination to prevent an accumulation of water;\r\ncounterforting the slopes in dry and mild weather with simple earth\r\ncounterforts 5 to 12 feet in width at intervals, and in length about\r\ntwice their height with a reasonable slope, the height being about half\r\nthat of the embankment; a dry retaining wall may also be erected in\r\ntemperate climates and in a comparatively unexposed situation: are all\r\nprecautionary measures that can be adopted. But in the case of a cutting\r\nin drift or permeable soil upon rock or an impermeable surface liable to\r\nbecome wet, which not infrequently occurs, the conditions of equilibrium\r\nmay easily be destroyed, and the slope upon the higher side may not\r\nstand at a less inclination than that of the hill. Obviously this slope\r\ncannot be obtained either in cuttings or embankments, therefore,\r\nprovided the drift is of considerable depth and treacherous, means must\r\nbe taken to prevent movement, and drains should be inserted so as to\r\nmake the earth capable of standing at a steeper inclination than it\r\nnaturally assumes; and in order to drain the ground at the seat of an\r\nembankment, a trench on the valley side filled with stones or supported\r\nby other means acting as a wall and drain can be made. Every precaution\r\nshould be taken to prevent any accumulation of water in earthworks in\r\nsidelong ground, and to gently control them, and to promote this object\r\nit is well that lateral outlets be opposite to each other so as to\r\nafford through drainage and an unobstructed flow.\r\n\r\nAs drift soil upon the inclined surface of a rock may be held by\r\nfriction, the least change may impair it sufficiently to cause movement,\r\ntherefore it is advisable to have a narrow gullet or heading excavated\r\nin short lengths, followed _pari passu_ with protective works, whether a\r\nretaining wall or not, so that the earth is weakened as little as\r\npossible by exposure and deprivation of its usual support; and there are\r\nmany places in which, unless the system of excavating in short lengths\r\nbe adopted, failure and slips must result.\r\n\r\nIn sidelong ground the formation is frequently partly in cutting and\r\npartly in embankment, if so, and the drain is impermeable and can be\r\nthoroughly relied upon, it may be advisable to make the formation\r\nincline towards the hill, so as to drain it, lessen, and perhaps prevent\r\npercolation into the semi-embankment or under its seat, for the soil\r\nbeing loosened by the process of excavation and deposition is in the\r\nmass more porous than in a cutting.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim of all drainage operations for the preservation of\r\nearthworks in sidelong ground is to prevent the hill waters guidelessly\r\nflowing into, upon, or under them, their accumulation, or any\r\nobstruction to their easy discharge; and to attain this object it is\r\nnecessary to know the location of the sources of the supply, the\r\nquantity, and other particulars, _vide_ Chap. IV. A proper system of\r\ndrains must therefore be made upon the hill-side to gather and gently\r\nguide the waters, to lead them by channels across the formation and\r\ndischarge them outside it, care being taken to protect and line the\r\nsurface of the drains so that no leakage occurs or any erosion of the\r\nface. In countries where the rainfall is excessive or sudden at certain\r\nplaces or entirely, it may be sufficient to protect the slopes so as to\r\nallow of a flow over them, and particularly upon the valley slope of an\r\nembankment, and in a lesser degree upon the hill-slope of a cutting.\r\n\r\nWhen the configuration of the country allows, it is advisable to avoid\r\ncuttings, and particularly embankments, in or upon drift soil lying upon\r\nan inclined surface of rock or impermeable soil, because it can so\r\neasily be disturbed, become unstable, and of the difficulty of restoring\r\nit to a state of equilibrium; in fact, this may be impossible, as\r\nvibration may cause it to move. In such a case the only means of\r\npreventing a slip is by erecting a wall at the toe of the slope, and as\r\nit is necessary that the foundations be in the rock beneath the surface\r\nearth, the simple operation of excavating may impel the drift down the\r\nhill. Also should an embankment be required upon drift soil its weight\r\nmay be sufficient to cause the mass to slide and a diversion of a\r\nrailway may be imperative, for the cost of a retaining wall, because of\r\nits height and the great pressure it would have to sustain, or be built\r\nto sustain, would prohibit the adoption of such a remedy. Therefore, an\r\nembankment is more to be feared than a cutting in such earth. Making\r\nbenchings in the rock below the drift to resist movement of an\r\nembankment will most probably be impracticable, and the soil may be in\r\nsuch a delicate condition that a shock or very little additional weight\r\nmay make it slip, and when once it has moved, its stability may not be\r\npermanently restored. Such a case may be considered as one of the worst\r\nthat can be encountered, and certainly the simple removal of detached\r\nmasses of rock that may slide upon the formation is easier to effect\r\nthan to treat drift soil upon an inclined rock bed.\r\n\r\nIt is always well to remember that in sidelong ground a hill may be\r\nreposing at the steepest slope of stability, and when the earth is rock\r\nit may dip in the direction of a cutting or be imposed upon a perishable\r\nstratum, such as porous or inferior shale. Support upon the valley side\r\nis then absolutely necessary to restore its normal equilibrium, and\r\nevery care should be taken to prevent water reaching the embankment or\r\ntrickling under its base, and to control all water that may permeate\r\nthrough fissures in the rock face, especially should it be loosely\r\nbedded. Earthworks in such positions require to be regularly watched.\r\n\r\nIn forming an embankment upon sidelong ground every means should be\r\nadopted to increase the friction between the tipped material and the\r\nsoil; consequently all turf or herbage should be removed in order that\r\nthe embankment may be upon the bare earth, care being taken that no\r\nloose top mould or turf is deposited, but only the firm soil. It may be\r\nadvisable to only tip earth excavated from the solid hill-side, and not\r\ntop soil such as that obtained from side cutting, and unless in rock or\r\nfirm soil to avoid partly side cutting and embankment.\r\n\r\nShould an embankment have to be tipped upon rock, care must be taken to\r\nprevent the surface water flowing under its base, and to counteract\r\nsliding movement the ground should be benched and a drain made on the\r\nhigher side; also in a deep cutting the slope or face should be stepped,\r\nor have a cess at about mid-height, or where desirable, to lessen the\r\neffect of the trickling of the surface water and to prevent a flow in a\r\ndirect line, which might make the velocity of any leakage waters\r\ndangerous, especially after a rapid thaw. On a mid-cess a catchwater\r\ndrain should be cut to intercept the surface water, which may not\r\npercolate but flow upon the slope, and, unless diverted and conducted to\r\nan outlet, may saturate or erode the bottom.\r\n\r\nBefore a cutting in drift soil upon the side of a hill can be drained,\r\nit may be necessary to sink a shaft upon the higher side some distance\r\nfrom the slope and construct a complete series of drains under the\r\nformation. Also should an embankment in sidelong ground be near to a\r\nriver, the exposed river-bank face must be protected, and in any case,\r\nwhen a pier of a bridge has to be placed close to the edge of a rock,\r\nthe face of the earth should be preserved by a substantial Portland\r\ncement concrete covering in order to prevent disintegration culminating\r\nin a slip or subsidence.\r\n\r\nIn setting out a line of railway or a canal care should be taken to\r\navoid, if practicable, either cuttings or embankments in soil resting\r\nupon inclined rock, as slips are almost sure to occur. However, should\r\nit be unavoidable, their depth and height should be reduced to a minimum\r\nand, if possible, the formation be raised until the bare rock crops out,\r\nand this can frequently be effected within the limits of deviation. Also\r\ndeep cuttings in clay or earth, having particles soon affected by\r\nweather, should be avoided, but they may be necessary; and should any\r\nhave to be located upon a sharp curve, it is advisable to excavate the\r\nprojecting spur on the convex side of the curve more than that required\r\nto obtain the formation width, as it is peculiarly exposed, and\r\ntherefore more likely to slip. When cuttings are upon the escarpment of\r\na clay hill the slope upon the valley side need not be so flat as that\r\nagainst the hill. An inclination of 3 or 4 to 1 may be necessary upon\r\nthe hill-side, whereas a 1½ to 1 slope may be sufficient upon the other.\r\nWhen a slip may involve the destruction or injury of any adjacent\r\nbuildings, the best plan is to erect a retaining wall at the foot of a\r\nslope, not less than about one-fourth of the height of an embankment or\r\nthe depth of a cutting, ample provision being made for drainage and the\r\nexpansion of the earth. It is a sure protection and support, and the\r\nconsequences of a slip may be most serious in such a position. The\r\nprotection of the slope and a breast wall may, however, be alone\r\nnecessary upon the valley-side.\r\n\r\nThe construction of embankments upon soft soil is here referred to so\r\nfar as regards lateral movement, or where vertical settlement causes\r\nsuch action by drawing asunder. Whenever the surface of the ground\r\nbulges or upheaves upon earth being tipped upon it or pressure applied,\r\nit shows that the disturbing harbingers of instability are in action and\r\nthat its sustaining power has been reached, its surface ruptured, and\r\nany more soil placed thereon will only sink and displace the earth until\r\nit meets the solid ground beneath, or the material becomes sufficiently\r\ncompressed and dense for it to sustain the load; such a condition of\r\nunrest generally proceeds from over-pressure and will loosen the soil,\r\nincrease percolation, and aid disintegration. When it is known that\r\nsoft, peaty, muddy, or silty earth overlies level solid ground, and it\r\nis certain it cannot escape, and can only be condensed by weighting\r\nuntil it will permanently bear the strain required, it can be built\r\nupon; although should there be more pressure at one place than another,\r\nor the character of the soil vary, in certain places be swampy and in\r\nothers dry, the surrounding ground will probably rise where the weight\r\nis the least; therefore, increased bearing area of an embankment maybe\r\nnecessary until the sustaining power of the earth is not exceeded, or\r\nslips and subsidences will occur, for the weight of an embankment in\r\nsuch a situation cannot be diminished by retaining walls, as stable\r\nfoundations are not to be obtained. It is obvious the width of the\r\nformation cannot be reduced and therefore the only way of lessening the\r\nload upon the base per square foot, assuming the embankment to act as a\r\nmass, and of distributing its weight, is by flattening the slope and\r\nmaking a platform under the seat of an embankment. All earths, however,\r\nthat are not hard rock subside upon being weighted, and in the case of\r\ntenacious clay soils, upon a considerable load being applied over a\r\nsmall area, a trifling contiguous uplifting of the ground will generally\r\nbe noticed. If such rise of the soil does not exceed about one-sixth of\r\nthe settlement of the clay under the load it may be disregarded as not\r\nlikely to cause a slip or serious lateral movement.\r\n\r\nWhen the foundation consists of a firm stratum of gravel, sand, or solid\r\nearth overlying soft soil such as quicksand or silt, _i.e._, mud and\r\nsand; or alluvial deposit, care must be taken that the latter is not\r\nforced up at a weak place by the additional weight of an embankment, and\r\nthe firm stratum undermined, as then it will sink, fissure, and be\r\nunsafe. Any disturbance of the bed or water of an estuary or lake other\r\nthan by the tides, currents, or wind is an indication that the earth\r\nbeneath the firm soil is overloaded, and that subsidences and slips will\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nBefore determining upon the necessary precautions that must be taken,\r\nthe deposits should be thoroughly examined and tests made of the amount\r\nof soluble and insoluble material in a certain mass, as although the\r\nearth may have the appearance of being mud, it may contain a\r\npreponderating proportion of insoluble particles of sand, and its\r\ncharacter may hardly be that of mud or silt. When a marsh rests upon\r\nclay it usually requires only reasonable care, but if upon mud or loose\r\nsand it may always be in a more or less unstable condition.\r\n\r\nThe chief means of consolidation in the construction of embankments of\r\nsoft soil upon soft ground may be stated to be as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. Draining, which must be deep, and should be effected before the earth\r\nembankment is deposited.\r\n\r\n2. Weighting the ground outside the slopes with firm material so as to\r\nconsolidate the soil by intermixture with it.\r\n\r\n3. The formation of terraces of earth, and by allowing the ground to\r\nsubside until movement is arrested, but there may be a porous seam of\r\nharder soil, such as gravel, under the soft ground, then care must be\r\ntaken not to dam back the flow of the underground waters by the\r\nsubsidence of the added earth or the whole embankment may slide, become\r\nsoftened and finally be swept away; therefore, through drainage must be\r\nmaintained under an embankment.\r\n\r\n4. Making the load as light as possible consistent with due\r\nconsolidation.\r\n\r\n5. Constructing an embankment in equal and regular layers of ashes or\r\nother dry, light, stable soil, and by drying the earth to be deposited\r\nby separation, wind, sun, or by burning.\r\n\r\nTo prevent slips in such situations, draining, although causing\r\nsubsidence, should be executed as long as possible before the embankment\r\nis tipped, is more effectual and certain in its action than any system\r\nof lessening the load or of counterweighting the soil, which may thereby\r\ntemporarily be brought to rest but afterwards give way; and any damming\r\nback of water may cause additional sinking, and change the condition of\r\nthe earth from a state of dampness to that of saturation. It may be easy\r\nto calculate the weight per square foot that will have to be sustained\r\nby the ground from an embankment and the heaviest train, but to make the\r\nnecessary allowance for the effects of vibration is not so readily\r\ncomputed. The ground can be weighted to ascertain the limit of its\r\nsustaining power. The test should extend for a period of several weeks\r\nto be thoroughly reliable, which time can seldom be afforded upon works;\r\ntherefore a considerable excess of sustaining power over the load should\r\nbe allowed.\r\n\r\nIn draining the site of an embankment in peat soil, it is advisable\r\nfirst to ascertain the depth to which trenches can be cut without the\r\nsides falling in. It generally varies from about 1 foot 6 inches to 3\r\nfeet. As the ground becomes firmer the drains can be deepened if\r\nrequired. The width should not be less than 2 feet 6 inches to 3 feet.\r\nCross drains can be cut at every 20 to 40 feet according to the state of\r\nthe soil. Peat usually drains freely at the surface when its level is\r\nnot at or below the water-bearing line of the country. A successful\r\nmethod of thoroughly draining the surface of peat moorland is to first\r\nmake a drain about 1 foot 6 inches in width and the depth of an ordinary\r\nspade, and leave it for a time until the top soil to that depth becomes\r\nfirmer, then repeat the operation until a depth of 3 feet is obtained,\r\nthe sides being excavated to a perpendicular face, the top turf being\r\ncarefully cut and stacked upon the surface to dry. Along the centre of\r\nthe bottom of the trench a small cut is made about 1 foot in depth and 6\r\ninches in width, leaving a 6-inch ledge upon each side, then the dry\r\nstacked turf 1 foot 6 inches in width previously excavated, is placed\r\nupon the ledge, the grass downwards and the layers reversed in rotation\r\nto the order in which they were excavated. This system in moss peat land\r\nis cheaper and better than tile or rough stone drains, as they often\r\nsettle unequally. The underneath drain will not close up provided the\r\nexcavated turf is carefully deposited, and water will not disintegrate\r\nthe peat. These drains should be cut about 20 feet apart.\r\n\r\nA more extensive system may be necessary, and a comparatively large area\r\nmay be required to be drained in order to obtain a firm foundation and\r\nto prevent breaking away of the ground. In such event the first drain on\r\neach side parallel to an embankment should be at a distance from the\r\ncentre line of the formation at least equal to the bottom width of an\r\nembankment, and as deep as the soil will allow, so as to drain the land\r\nwithin the fences. A cut should also be made outside the fencing at a\r\ndistance of not less than 10 feet from the inside drain, to catch the\r\nsurface waters and prevent their flowing upon the enclosed land. Cross\r\ndrains may be required at intervals of from 15 to 50 feet according to\r\nthe character and depth of the bog. The sides of the open drains may\r\nrequire to be supported. Branches of trees and rough fascine work laid\r\nin them have been used to an extent so as not to interfere with the\r\nflow; and when a spoil or fence bank has to be deposited it should be\r\nmade a reasonable distance from the drains or they may become closed.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should be directed to make the drainage of the same degree\r\nthroughout the area; it is therefore necessary to know whether the water\r\ncan be discharged into a channel or adjacent river, or if the bottom of\r\nthe drains will be above the general water-discharge level of the\r\ndistrict so as to prevent the ground being in the condition of a sponge\r\nalways full of water and becoming a floating mass. When the peat soil is\r\nof little depth and rests upon sand or clay, drainage can be effected by\r\nside drains reaching to the underlying stratum, and the drains can be\r\nopen and be filled with gravel to prevent the sides falling or the\r\nbottom rising. Few serious slips will take place in bog-land when the\r\nprecautionary works named in this chapter are more or less executed;\r\nsubsidence is then the chief difficulty. It cannot be entirely\r\nprevented, but it may be lessened. It is frequently very considerable,\r\ndepending principally upon the depth, situation, and character of the\r\ndeposit and the proportion of water in it. Deep bog-lands upon being\r\ndrained have subsided as much as 4 to 5 feet the first year, and 10 to\r\n12 feet the second, and in the worst situations they will continue to\r\nsubside until the earth is sufficiently compact to support the insistent\r\nweight, and they have sunk as much as 30 feet before the ground became\r\nconsolidated. Burnt ballast, fine gravel, or sandy gravel, is to be\r\npreferred as ballast upon peat embankments, as affording an even coating\r\nand tending to consolidate the earth, whereas broken rock ballast breaks\r\nup the surface, as the pieces are not uniform in size and are\r\nfragmentary. The cost of maintenance on bog or marsh-land is sure to be\r\nheavy for two or three years, but then the road will generally have\r\nbecome firm. The chief points in maintenance are to cause equal loading\r\nand to promote thorough drainage. Baulks laid under the sleepers, or the\r\nlongitudinal system of permanent way, is not advantageous in soft soil,\r\nand even should a longitudinal bearer be placed upon the cross sleepers\r\nthe road is difficult to lift or pack, and less timber will be required\r\nby a reduction of the distance between the cross sleepers. The rail\r\njoints should also be stiffened so as to make the depth of the\r\nundulations consequent upon the passage of a train as regular as\r\npossible, and the number of the sleepers can be increased with this\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe sustaining power of peat moss, and peat which is sometimes found\r\nunder a bed of gravel and upon a substratum of clay or marl; and\r\nbog-land varies greatly. As a rule high bog-land will bear the greater\r\nweight. The only reliable method of ascertaining its sustaining\r\ncapabilities is by an actual test, and such experiments are the more\r\nrequisite in unreliable soils such as mud and slake, alluvial deposits,\r\npeat and bog-land. It is known that some mossy peat and bog-land will\r\nnot even resist the weight of a stone of ordinary size, but will upheave\r\nand shake upon very little pressure being applied. By draining and other\r\nconsolidating operations such land may be rendered capable of sustaining\r\na load if the weight be spread over a considerable area upon a platform\r\nof poles, timber, or fascine work, as it then as it were, floats upon\r\nthe surface; but piling is not successful, as the piles disunite the\r\nparticles, destroy the continuity of the layers and make a passage for\r\nwater. The elasticity of bog-land is manifest even when a road-bed has\r\nbecome sufficiently firm and even-bearing for traffic, by the agitation\r\nof the water in any adjoining drains.\r\n\r\nIn low bog-land, peat-moss, or peat-land, it is important to ascertain\r\nwhether the deposit extends to a considerable depth, as in Holland it\r\nhas been found that some marshes simply rest upon a bed of water, being\r\nnothing but floating peat moss, although having as great a thickness as\r\n20 feet. It has also been noticed that marsh-lands often rest upon peat\r\nmosses with a small layer or film of loam upon them, and that they are\r\nfloating masses, although the water upon which they float may not be\r\ndeep; its depth may be known by the insertion of a bar or boring-tool,\r\nfor when it sinks suddenly it has probably reached the water, and until\r\nits downward movement stops it shows that water exists.\r\n\r\nPeat bogs consist of decomposed mosses, grasses, aquatic plants, and\r\nmud. In mountainous districts when they are superimposed upon hard or\r\nnon-weathering rock, such as quartz, they have little thickness; if upon\r\nclay rock, or any that decomposes under weather influences, they are\r\nusually of considerable depth. As a rule, the greater the specific\r\ngravity of peat, the firmer it is and also the darker. The top layers\r\nare generally the most fibrous and the driest, although spongy and\r\ncontaining vegetable matter, and are of a light brown colour, and of\r\nless specific gravity than the next deposit, which is of a darker brown\r\ntint, and is denser and more decomposed; the peat then becomes brown\r\nblack or black in hue and approaches a coaly condition. Compact turf\r\nusually contains little water, but should it be of a mossy nature it is\r\ngenerally saturated. Wet bog, peat, or moorland may contain as much as\r\n80 per cent. of water, and any soil having so large a proportion must\r\nnecessarily subside and change upon being thoroughly and regularly\r\ndrained, and have its bearing power increased in a ratio approximate to\r\nthe percentage of water in it before draining and that after such\r\noperation has been effected, other conditions being similar. The depth\r\nand character of the top layers will indicate the best method of\r\nprocedure, and whether it is advisable to excavate them and deposit an\r\nembankment upon the lower and firmer bed.\r\n\r\nIn Holland, where the peat is superimposed upon sandy soil, in order to\r\nprevent slips in embankments it is found advisable to excavate a trench\r\nabout 15 to 20 feet in width and as wide as the formation width of a\r\nrailway or road, until it reaches the subsoil, and to fill it with sand;\r\nand when an embankment has to be formed of very porous earth, to make a\r\ntrench at the toe of each slope, and to fill it with sand so as to act\r\nas a counterfort. Peat and sand have been found to laterally spread the\r\nmost, clay and sand less, and therefore the latter soil stands at a\r\nsteeper slope.\r\n\r\nOn the South Austrian system of railways marsh-land has been made firm,\r\nand malaria-fever almost annihilated by depositing ashes over the earth.\r\nWhen they are mixed with the bog or swamp deposit, it is found that they\r\ncause it to become fertile.\r\n\r\nPeaty soils and peat bogs, which latter it should always be remembered\r\nmay be almost floating upon water and have a surface layer of vegetation\r\nand moss, must be differently treated to other soft soils, and thorough\r\ndrainage may be economically impossible in deep deposits. In such a\r\nsituation, as the peat is alone capable of bearing the pressure, it\r\nshould not be disturbed or the particles disunited, for the continuity\r\nof the layers will then be destroyed, and probably cause an upward flow\r\nor other passage of water upon pressure being applied. This state is\r\nfrequently met with where inland waters have existed, as in that case\r\nthe peat moss covering has sunk, the depression depending upon the depth\r\nof the peat underneath it and the distance at which the firm ground is\r\nreached. It is, therefore, advisable to ascertain this, as then some\r\nidea of the probable subsidence may be known.\r\n\r\nThe system of a platform of poles, hurdles, or fascine-work is well\r\nknown, and has been proved to be effectual in preventing any dangerous\r\nlateral or vertical movement. Sand, fine gravel, ashes, or other binding\r\nmaterial, spread over the surface of peat consolidates it and assists in\r\npreventing movement, and it is well if such a covering extends for some\r\ndistance in front and at the sides of an embankment to keep the ground\r\nfrom rising. Upon soft soil, a thick layer of clean sand, well wetted\r\nand consolidated, 5 feet or more in depth, has been used in lieu of\r\npiles for forming a bed upon which to deposit a Portland cement concrete\r\nfoundation to receive heavy masonry piers of a bridge, and at much less\r\nexpense and with greater expedition, and no slip or subsidence of the\r\nground has occurred.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious the earth should be deposited in even layers, similarly to\r\nthe general method of closing reclamation embankments from the bottom\r\nupwards; staging is, therefore, necessary for the waggons to run upon\r\nand discharge their contents, but piles should not be driven, as they\r\ndisturb and upheave the earth and do not consolidate any soil. A\r\nsuccessful system of depositing embankments of bog or peat earth is to\r\nthoroughly cut up, pun, and tread down the soil in order that it may not\r\nshrink in cakes. If an embankment subsides and must be raised, only\r\nlight earth or material should be used. “Forming” or embankments of\r\nlittle height are usually made from the drain excavation, and when more\r\nearth is required the outer ditches are widened and deepened so that the\r\nfenced-in land is made as firm as possible upon which a railway or a\r\nroad has to be maintained.\r\n\r\nFascine mattresses, to prevent slips and subsidence in an embankment in\r\nvery soft ground, such as loose sand, are to be recommended, and\r\nexperienced engineers have expressed their belief that they are the best\r\nmeans of procuring a firm foundation and securing it from scour in loose\r\nsandy and soft deposits; and their employment may become necessary when\r\nthe earth is very wet, and the contour of the district renders effective\r\ndrainage or consolidation of the soil difficult or impracticable. Should\r\nthe ground after drainage be only damp, brushwood, or heather, so laid\r\nas to offer the firmest and most even bed may be sufficient; and if sand\r\ncan be used with it, it is very advantageous; but the fascine or a more\r\nsolid method of distributing weight may have to be adopted. Fascines\r\nshould be laid over the whole base of an embankment and extend some\r\nlittle distance upon each side, beyond the toe of the slope, and be made\r\nstronger according to the load they have to support, which, of course,\r\nincreases towards the centre of an embankment, where it is greatest, in\r\norder to prevent their breaking apart and becoming detached.\r\n\r\nIn peaty soils an embankment should be formed of light dry materials, be\r\nspread out, have equal bearing, and be of as little height as possible,\r\nand all hollows and depressions should be carefully filled. The worst\r\nstate of peaty or bog soils upon which an embankment has to be tipped is\r\nwhen they are no better than a floating mass.\r\n\r\nWhere a stratum of sound firm soil, such as gravel, lies upon a soft bed\r\nof great depth, by increasing the bearing area upon the firm earth and\r\nnot interfering with it, a stable foundation for an embankment may be\r\nobtained. In such a case a cutting should be avoided, for if care be\r\ntaken not to impair or injure the firm top layer it may stand without\r\nserious subsidence, but under other conditions it would be unstable, and\r\nwhen a soft stratum is affected and its natural condition altered, it\r\nmay be very difficult to restore it to a state of permanent equilibrium\r\nin consequence of it being in almost a constant state of mutation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  THE DEPOSITION OF AN EMBANKMENT.—PREPARATION OF THE GROUND UPON\r\n    WHICH AN EMBANKMENT HAS TO BE DEPOSITED.—METHODS OF\r\n    PROCEDURE.—CONSIDERATION OF SOME OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.—THE\r\n    EFFECT OF THE HEIGHT OF A TIP AND THE LENGTH OF A LEAD.—THE STEAM\r\n    NAVVY AND EMBANKMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the deposition of an embankment, one of the chief objects\r\nto be accomplished is to make it homogeneous and prevent the formation\r\nof solid layers, which may become detached along the line of\r\nstratification from less compact strata. Careless and intermittent\r\ntipping conducted in dry and wet weather and with different kinds of\r\nearth, probably in various conditions, will cause slips and subsidences;\r\nas also any local disturbance of the soil, which is always more porous\r\nand absorbent of water than when in its natural unexcavated state,\r\nalthough it may be free from water-pressure which may exist in a\r\ncutting: and particularly so when fresh-tipped, as then the pressure and\r\nstrain upon it is at the maximum, its tendency to unstableness gradually\r\ndecreasing as it becomes consolidated. In hard granular soils this is\r\nalmost certainly the case, but consequent upon percolation of water into\r\na mass deposited in a dry state that expands; it may not be so in\r\naluminous or other earth having particles affected by moisture, for an\r\nadditional or an unequal load after a settlement may cause further\r\nmovement and irregular density. In countries where the ground becomes\r\ncaked or parched during the dry season, the change to a wet or saturated\r\ncondition affects them much more than in variable climates, as they are\r\nthen generally in a moist state.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to decree that no embankment shall be made of any earth of a\r\ntreacherous character, if the circumstances are known to conduce to\r\ninstability, and to rigidly specify what shall be done and what shall\r\nnot be done, but the exigencies of an undertaking may cause such\r\nstipulations to be impracticable. For instance, it may be found that no\r\nother earth may be available except that which is proscribed. No one\r\nwith a knowledge of earthwork would desire to erect an embankment of\r\nconsiderable height of yellow or sandy clay, or excavate a deep cutting\r\nin such soil unless a considerable allowance be made to provide against\r\ncontingencies; nevertheless, it has to be done, and will have to be\r\ndone. The precisianism and delicate refinement of a specification\r\nreplete with good intentions has, therefore, very frequently to be toned\r\ndown in order to allow of the execution of work.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious the care that is bestowed upon a reservoir embankment,\r\nsuch as the damping, punning, rolling, mixing of the material, and\r\nraising it in layers, is not necessary in a railway or ordinary\r\nembankment; however, certain precautions should be observed and may be\r\neffected at a small cost, and it is well to remember that errors of\r\nconstruction will cause undue strain upon particular parts. A fruitful\r\ncause of a slip or subsidence in an embankment is the variation of the\r\ncharacter and condition of the tipped earth. It seldom happens that the\r\nsoil of a cutting of considerable extent is the same throughout in\r\ncharacter and condition; and the earth in an embankment tipped at one\r\nend may be different to that deposited at the other, and therefore the\r\npoint of contact of the two earths will probably be troublesome. When a\r\nseam of unstable soil occurs in a clay cutting, it should not be tipped\r\nbut be run to spoil. Such layers are usually of small extent, yet in an\r\nembankment they may cause portions to run in rainy or frosty weather.\r\n\r\nSide cuttings are a protection against slips in embankments when they\r\nare sufficiently far from the toe of the slope, as they form drainage\r\nchannels, but the excavation being top soil is loose and porous,\r\ntherefore, when the lower portion of an embankment is made from side\r\ncutting and the upper from a cutting, the firm material may be at the\r\ntop and the more open earth at the base; consequently, if an embankment\r\nin soil of a doubtful character must be partly constructed from side\r\ncutting and partly from cutting, especial care is required in forming it\r\nso as to prevent slips and subsidence, and also, in excavating any\r\nground for such purposes, it is advisable not to interfere with any\r\nditches, or join them, as by concentration a stream may be created. In\r\ncountries where land is of little value, contractor’s plant expensive,\r\nnot to be obtained in the district, and carriage costly, embankments in\r\nmost cases can be more cheaply and quickly deposited from side cutting\r\nthan cutting, the excavation from the latter being run to spoil instead\r\nof tipped by waggons into the embankment, therefore, their erection by\r\nsuch means becomes imperative for reasons of economy.\r\n\r\nIn depositing embankments it is well to remember that experience has\r\nproved that materials uniform in size and homogeneous in character form\r\nthe most compact and impenetrable masses. The great stability of\r\nbreakwaters formed of materials of uniform size and the firmness of\r\nmacadamized roads are proofs of this. The same rule applies to soils. It\r\nis the separation of the larger bodies from the smaller that causes a\r\nwant of cohesiveness and weight-sustaining power.\r\n\r\nTo prevent embankments of little height as in “forming,” spreading,\r\nslipping or weathering, as they are usually constructed from side\r\ncutting and loose top soil, the sods over the site of the side cutting\r\nshould be removed and a turf wall be made of them on each side of the\r\nformation, the excavation being deposited within them, when it will\r\nsettle equally and become consolidated, the wall preventing it spreading\r\nand also saving expense in maintenance.\r\n\r\nIn an embankment of soft earth that weathers quickly, the tipped\r\nmaterial should be allowed to take its natural slope, and then every\r\neffort should be made to prevent its equilibrium being destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhere heavy and sudden rainfall occurs the edges of the formation have\r\nbeen purposely tipped and maintained from 6 to 12 inches above the\r\nheight of the centre, in order to prevent during construction gutters or\r\neroded channels being formed upon the slopes, the central portion being\r\ndrained and the water led away. However, aqueous action may not\r\ndeleteriously affect earth when tipped into an embankment\r\nnotwithstanding that the soil cannot be made in the same state as before\r\nexcavation, and that deposited material is more open and subject to\r\npercolation than the solid unexcavated earth; on the other hand,\r\nalthough the percolation and degree of exposure to the atmosphere are\r\ngreater, in some soils this may tend to drain and render them harder and\r\nmore stable. In fact, special circumstances may alter the general\r\nbehaviour of any earth, but the material forming an embankment should be\r\nregarded as in the same condition as if it had been exposed to\r\nmeteorological influences, and it should be remembered that in railway,\r\ndock, or canal works the deposited earth is seldom uniform throughout,\r\nit being either soft at one place and hard at another, or intermixed in\r\na manner unknown in nature, and that exceptionally difficult cases may\r\noccur which can hardly be treated by any particular method of procedure\r\nor even in the way which experience has proved to be effectual in\r\nseveral instances in similar soils under apparently like conditions.\r\n\r\nThe system of tipping has some influence upon the stability of an\r\nembankment and the prevention of slips and subsidences.\r\n\r\nThe first operation is the preparation of the ground upon which an\r\nembankment will be deposited. Solid hillocks or firm mounds that in any\r\nway tend to arrest motion should not be removed, but vegetable or bush\r\ngrowth should be destroyed, and where slips and subsidences are likely\r\nto occur, turf and all soft soapy matter should be stripped so that the\r\ndeposited earth rests upon a sound stratum. In the dyke countries of\r\nNorth West Europe, before an embankment is deposited, care is taken to\r\nremove all trees and roots so as to effect a thorough connection between\r\nthe ground and the earth forming the embankment.\r\n\r\nIt is well if the ground be ploughed, raked, or harrowed, so as to offer\r\na rough and similar surface to the tipped material, and also to obviate\r\nany arrest of the percolation of water, which upon reaching a turf or\r\nsmooth or less permeable surface, may form a water seam at the foot of\r\nan embankment. It may not be necessary to strip the turf for the full\r\nwidth of the base of an embankment, but only for some 20 feet from the\r\ntoe of the slope on each side. As the earth is bared it should be\r\ncovered in order not to expose it to the weather, for should the surface\r\nbe coated with mud, water will accumulate, as it cannot drain away or\r\nevaporate as quickly as when the ground at the seat is laid bare; and\r\nalso if the top soil be mere dust moisture will convert it into mud.\r\nWhen the surface of the ground is inclined it can be benched or bared,\r\nand it is open to question whether baring and harrowing the surface is\r\nnot a better practice than benching, as it gives uniform support and\r\nincreases friction and prevents a sliding surface, and is generally a\r\nquicker and cheaper method to adopt as the soil need not be so prepared\r\nfor a greater depth than 6 to 9 inches. Benching may be the better\r\nsystem to adopt, in loose and non-cohesive earths which require support\r\nto prevent rolling, but it must be carefully made with the necessary\r\nslopes and inclination of cess to prevent a localization of water, or\r\nthe ledges may slip and carry away the material deposited upon them. The\r\nground at the seat of an embankment can also be prepared by ploughing\r\nover it and removing the disturbed earth with a scraper.\r\n\r\nThe drainage of the ground is most important in order that water cannot\r\nreach the seat of an embankment. Many systems are referred to in Chapter\r\nIV., and others are herein named. A complete system of drains may be\r\nnecessary, but much depends upon the character and sound condition of\r\nthe earth and whether the slopes and formation are protected. Simply\r\ncovering the whole area of the seat, or that upon which the base of the\r\nslopes rests, with broken stone obtained from the cuttings may suffice,\r\nthe stone being so deposited that water flows from the centre to the\r\nsides, with a rough drain here and there, or central, diagonal, and\r\nlateral drains may be required; but the pressure of the deposited earth\r\nfrequently causes land springs to issue in the seat of an embankment,\r\nthe existence of which was not conjectured, hence the effect of tipping\r\nshould be watched.\r\n\r\nSlips and subsidences are induced in embankments by the material being\r\ndeposited when the soil is dry, and in every state of humidity from\r\ndampness to saturation; consequently the earth settles unequally, is\r\ndenser in parts, and a stratification is caused as if it were composed\r\nof dissimilar earths. Should any soil be deposited in the same condition\r\nthroughout, and be punned or rammed in layers, it becomes as near its\r\noriginal texture as is possible to quickly attain; but in depositing\r\nrailway embankments, which cannot be punned or rammed, the perfect\r\nincorporation of any soil is not effected by the simple operation of\r\ntipping from a spurn head, and stratification of earth is\r\ndisadvantageous, inasmuch as the layers may not be homogeneous, and in\r\nrailway embankments are, with a few exceptions, in a different state\r\nowing to changes in the character of the soil, the effects of weather,\r\nmode of excavation, and in a lesser degree the height and length of the\r\nlead or distance from the cutting to the tip; the stratification,\r\ntherefore, becomes varied and irregular, and depressions are formed\r\nwhich may hold water, and none should be permitted to accumulate in or\r\nupon a freshly tipped embankment, for then it is in its most permeable\r\ncondition, and in retentive soil especially the existence of a wet place\r\nmay cause it to become so deteriorated that it cannot be made stable\r\nwithout being drained, and when the earth is liable to become\r\nalternately very wet and dry, every means must be taken to lessen the\r\ndeleterious effects.\r\n\r\nProvided an embankment is tipped of one kind of earth, although it will\r\nbe in a more open state than the solid unexcavated ground, the slopes\r\ngiven to it are flatter than the angle of repose, the weight brought\r\nupon it does not exceed the safe load, that it is deposited upon level\r\nground in regular and equal particles and the soil of ordinary\r\ncharacter, there is no reason that it should slip or subside unequally\r\nif it be not undermined by aqueous action. Under these conditions\r\nsettlement would be equal, or nearly so, and as all deep embankments\r\nmust necessarily subside from about 10 to 40 per centum, and in extreme\r\ncases one-half, the object to be gained is to cause the settlement to be\r\neven and regular towards the centre. Benching the ground so as to\r\nprevent a movement of the toe, does not aid equal settlement nor keep\r\nthe portion of an embankment above the level of the ground from\r\nspreading, except from the resistance offered by the cohesion and\r\nfriction of the soil; whereas, if the ground slopes inwards towards the\r\ncentre the earth has a tendency to rest and come together, and therefore\r\nnot to slip upon the slopes. This system is subsequently referred to.\r\n\r\nAll saturated or wet earth should, if practicable, be run to spoil, but\r\nit is not easily effected, as it cannot well be filled into one waggon\r\nof a set, for it may be present throughout the whole surface of a\r\ncutting, nor in variable weather can operations be conveniently\r\nsuspended until the exposed faces of a cutting are dry, but means are\r\ngenerally available by which any serious deterioration may be lessened.\r\n\r\nNo turf, mould, mud, peat-moss, soft pasty earth, frozen soil, or snow,\r\nshould be deposited in an embankment, but only firm earth; and no solid\r\nlumps of large size intermixed with shovelled material unless they are\r\nbroken up and trimmed when tipped, as the absorption of water will be\r\ngreater in the earth having the smaller particles; and should it happen\r\nthat several waggon-loads of such material are tipped and are succeeded\r\nby others containing large lumps, an embankment cannot be a homogeneous\r\nmass, but will consist of more or less consolidated portions in a\r\ncomparatively dry state, and others which are less impervious and\r\ntherefore more subject to the effects of water and settlement. All snow\r\nor frozen soil or muddy earth should be cleared away from the spurn\r\nhead, and if it can be avoided no material should be tipped in bad\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the loosening of the soil by the process of tipping,\r\ntaking into consideration that railway embankments are almost invariably\r\nformed in masses of 2, 3, or 4 cubic yards, according to the capacity of\r\na waggon, it is obvious almost the whole bulk has been disturbed, and\r\nthat the condition of the solid earth in a cutting is not maintained,\r\nfor the soil in addition to being unbound by the process of excavation,\r\ncasting into waggons, and shaking during transition, is ejected with\r\nforce down the slope of the tip, the impetus having to be dispersed. It\r\nis certain the size of earth waggons cannot conveniently be much\r\nincreased, and that little would be gained if a cubic yard or two were\r\nadded to their contents; and that the higher an embankment the greater\r\nthe velocity of the soil down the slope of the tip and the loosening\r\naction which causes the earth to be lighter and to take a flatter slope\r\nthan when deposited in layers from a moderate height, also the greater\r\nthe length of the lead, the greater the vibration and agitation. In the\r\ncase of certain soils the particles of which become soft or dissolved\r\nwhen in a wet state, such as sandy clay, loamy soil, and some varieties\r\nof clay, _vide_ Chapter II., the effect of a long lead or even a short\r\none will be that the more solid portion of the contents of a waggon will\r\nsettle, leaving the loose or mud at the top, and when a waggon is tipped\r\nthe loose top “slurry” will roll down the tip almost as a fluid and\r\nproceed beyond the spurn head, thus making a wet sliding surface, the\r\nbottom toil frequently remaining in the waggons and requiring to be\r\nexcavated from it. Nothing can be done in such a case but wait until the\r\nearth has had time to dry, or preferably the wet mud should be run to\r\nspoil. In fact a long lead, especially when aided by deposition from a\r\nconsiderable height, will cause friable soil possessing particles\r\nreadily impaired or dissolved in water to become dust when in a dry\r\nstate, or mud if saturated.\r\n\r\nThe gradients and leads chiefly determine the manner in which earthwork\r\ncan be economically executed, and are, in great measure, governed by the\r\nconfiguration and roads of the country; therefore, it will usually\r\nhappen that the length of the lead cannot be reduced, and the only\r\nresource is to lessen the height of the tip, and, consequently, the\r\nmomentum of the earth down the slope, and to reduce the inclination of\r\nthe temporary road at the tip head to that sufficient to cause the\r\ncontents of a waggon to be freely ejected and no more. This cannot be\r\neffected at the same cost as depositing an embankment to the full\r\nheight, although in the case of an uphill lead a down gradient upon\r\nwhich the waggons will run freely by force of gravity can be made from\r\nthe commencement of a cutting to the required width, the embankment\r\nbeing raised to its desired height without extra expense but assuming\r\nthe case of an embankment 60 feet in height, and that in order to make\r\nit as dense and firm as possible it has to be tipped in three heights\r\naveraging 20 feet, it involves the laying, maintaining, and removal of\r\nthree temporary roads instead of one, and cannot be erected without\r\nextra expenditure. The large majority of railway embankments have been\r\ndeposited to the full height and width, and they stand; although the\r\neffect of tipping loose soil upon loose soil, which has not had time to\r\nconsolidate, is at each addition to cause a movement of the surface. It\r\nis obvious the higher the tip the greater the disturbance, but it may be\r\nsaid in firm and hard granular earth, if always dry, this unbinding,\r\nalthough temporarily a disturbing element, may really tend to produce\r\nultimate homogeneity and stability; on the other hand, in tipping dry\r\nclay from a considerable height it often separates and becomes loose and\r\nmere dust.\r\n\r\nIn an embankment of moderate height the day’s excavation from a cutting\r\nwill increase its length several yards, and the material from each set\r\nof waggons will only be exposed to the weather for a short time. On the\r\ncontrary, in a high embankment, the effect of the deposition of the\r\ncontents of a set of waggons upon the tip head is hardly perceptible,\r\nand is, until the toe of the slope is approached, the superimposition of\r\na thin layer of earth which a shower of rain can convert into mud or\r\ncause to be in a soft or disunited condition, especially in the case of\r\nsoils having easily soluble particles. The deteriorating influence of\r\nhigh deposition may be judged from the closing of an embankment of\r\nconsiderable height, as it is often a tedious and somewhat anxious\r\nundertaking, as might be expected from excavated, shaken, and loosened\r\nearth being deposited upon soil in a similar condition, instead of upon\r\nthe solid ground like the other portions of an embankment. Also water\r\nfrequently percolates and trickles down the approaching slopes, and\r\npenetrates them and loosens the soil, whereas if one tip is proceeding,\r\nany surface waters may flow away upon the slope and the solid ground,\r\nand the earth has time to become in a similar state throughout. To\r\nlessen these disintegrating effects, if it can be done without\r\ninterfering with the due progress of the works, it is well to allow one\r\ntip end to consolidate for some time, and to complete the closure of the\r\nembankment solely from the other, suitable means being adopted to effect\r\na firm junction. Should closing from a single tip head be impracticable,\r\nthe earth from the meeting point of the toe of the slopes of the tip\r\nheads should be similar in character and be deposited in the same\r\ncondition; in any case additional care should be taken to adopt every\r\nreasonable precaution to secure equal consolidation. As evidence of the\r\ndissipation of earth at and near to the junction of two high tip heads\r\nmay be stated that they require more material to close them than would\r\nappear to be necessary from a computation based upon measurements taken\r\nfrom cross sections. In non-granular earths few cases will occur in\r\nwhich high tipping is an advantage; one of the few is when loose rock\r\nand firm earth are deposited, then the rock having larger particles, and\r\nconsequently being heavier, will roll to the foot of the tip before the\r\nsmaller material, and so form a broken stone seat for the embankment. In\r\ngranular earths, such as gravel or sand, the height of a tip head is not\r\na matter requiring much careful attention, as the particles are not\r\ndeleteriously affected by water. When they are of nearly equal size, an\r\nembankment will settle equally, but in gravelly sand the stone will\r\nseparate to some extent during transit and the process of deposition\r\nwill be at the base; a varying slope may then be assumed, and it may\r\nhere be named that it is known when sand is differently deposited,\r\nalthough its appearance is unaltered, it will exert dissimilar thrusts.\r\nAn embankment of little height may be deposited in bad weather without\r\nslipping or subsidence, but when a high embankment is similarly tipped\r\nthe surface of the earth is in an unfit state, and operations should be\r\nsuspended for a few days.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the systems of tipping and the prevention of slips, as a\r\ngeneral rule an embankment should be deposited to the full width, for if\r\nit be not erected at one operation the earth may be of a different\r\ncharacter in diverse conditions, and will be more exposed to the\r\nvicissitudes of weather; and in wide embankments, should the system be\r\nadopted of tipping two outer roads and one central road, the three tips\r\nshould equally proceed in order that the earth may be in a similar state\r\nand be subject to equal exposure; or weathered surfaces will be created\r\ndown which water will more easily percolate than through the solid mass.\r\nIn the three tip system the two sides have a tendency to lean towards\r\neach other, and cause the greatest pressure to be upon the inner\r\nmaterial during construction, and therefore the embankment is supposed\r\nto be more consolidated and less likely to slip; but, unless the\r\nconditions are exactly similar, the advantage of this arrangement is\r\nmore fanciful than real, for should the inside slopes of the outer roads\r\nmeet first, the earth deposited from the centre tip has not an equal\r\ndistance to descend and, therefore, the mass has not been tipped from\r\nthe same height, the looser material, temporarily or permanently, being\r\nupon the outer tips and the denser in the centre; whereas the slopes,\r\nbeing the most exposed, should be the more compact, and when they settle\r\ntowards the centre without an outward movement at the foot, so much the\r\nbetter for the stability of the embankment. The pressure upon the seat\r\nis more regular when it is deposited to the full width, as weight is\r\nthen not irregularly added, probably after some settlement. Instead of\r\ndividing the tips into two outer roads and one central road, and in that\r\nway endeavouring to obtain permanent stability, it is better to diminish\r\nthe height the earth has to be cast, and to deposit it as far as\r\npracticable in lifts, and to the full width. In treacherous soils such\r\nas some of the clays, embankments that would not stand at a depth of 30\r\nfeet have been permanently stable when the seat was drained, and they\r\nwere tipped in lifts of 15 to 20 feet in soft clay, and 20 to 25 feet in\r\nfirmer clay, at double the height at which they previously slipped.\r\n\r\nThis method involves the expense of moving the temporary roads, but\r\nallows more time for subsidence, and the mass of an embankment is not so\r\nexposed to the weather; however, in a dry season, an embankment can\r\noften be tipped to the full height, whereas in wet or changeable weather\r\nit would not stand if so deposited, and two lifts may be required. Care\r\nshould be taken that the width is always sufficient to receive the top\r\nlift. It is more in the direction of equally reducing the height the\r\nmaterial has to be tipped, especially in treacherous soils, that\r\nsolidity is to be attained, than in an attempt to consolidate earth by\r\nendeavouring to cause it to fall together by deposition from two or more\r\nseparate parallel roads at the same level.\r\n\r\nMany slips and failures of embankments have been caused by the central\r\nportion being deposited of one material, such as clay, and the slopes\r\nafterwards made of a different earth, as rock. The latter will then slip\r\nupon the greasy surface of the clay, the porous nature of the broken\r\nrock readily admitting water and air. In fact, a more flagrant example\r\nof effecting that which on no account should be done is not easy to\r\nimagine. In treacherous soil the system of tipping an embankment wider\r\nthan that required from considerations of lateral and vertical\r\nsettlement, and allowing it to stand at a steeper slope than its\r\npermanent angle of repose, and paring down the top unnecessary width is\r\nnot to be commended, as the earth is then strained, and the lower\r\nportion is in the looser condition and the toe the weakest part:\r\nhowever, in the construction of a single line of railway with a narrow\r\nformation width, it is very convenient as affording room for roads for\r\nloaded and empty waggons, and in any soils other than aluminous and\r\ncalcareous earths it may be done with impunity, provided all slimy and\r\nslippery surfaces are removed. No side tipping should be allowed in\r\ndepositing a new embankment, and any addition of soil to a slope should\r\nbe avoided as much as practicable, although in trimming some filling may\r\nbe necessary, but the slopes should be rough trimmed by the bank-head\r\nmen as the earth is deposited so as to prevent hollows and depressions,\r\nform a comparatively even and regular surface, cause the mass to be\r\nequally exposed to the weather, and prevent any lodgment of water. The\r\nform a tip head naturally assumes will afford some indication of the\r\nstability, for should it be regular and approach a semicircular shape it\r\nshows the earth is of a comparatively uniform character and is subsiding\r\nequally. When it is uneven and jagged, with streaks down the tip, it\r\nindicates unevenness of soil and condition.\r\n\r\nCircumstances arise which necessitate a departure from any generally\r\napproved method, for frequently an embankment must be widened to provide\r\nfor increased traffic, and tipping upon a consolidated surface must be\r\neffected. Chapter VIII. and this refer to such a condition of work. It\r\nsometimes occurs when a slip has taken place that only a narrow tip can\r\nbe adopted, as the soil may not temporarily be able to bear the weight\r\nof a larger mass unless equally diffused; then there is no other\r\nreasonable course to pursue than to complete an embankment to the\r\nrequired width and slopes by dry side-filling, such as ashes, broken\r\nbricks, or other absorbent firm material regularly and carefully\r\ndeposited. In order to prevent slips and subsidence and increase\r\nfriction, when an embankment must be widened by tipping upon its side,\r\nthe existing slope should be stripped of all turf or covering, but only\r\nso as to leave no uncovered surface exposed to the weather; and the\r\nbared earth should be made to present an even surface. When the slope is\r\nbenched, care should be taken that the benchings do not localise water,\r\nand that it cannot percolate down the face of the old bank at its point\r\nof junction with the new; also in tipping an embankment upon sidelong\r\nground or upon the slope of an old bank, the seat should be bared,\r\nparticularly on the lower side, as the earth meets with no resistance\r\nfrom the ground except from friction; but upon the upper side, the\r\nmaterial being tipped partly against the hill has a less distance to\r\ntravel, and, therefore, the upper or lesser slope is not so loose as the\r\nlower or longer slope, which latter is the more likely to admit water,\r\nand requires a flatter inclination than the denser portion of the\r\nembankment. In the absence of other protective works, it is advisable to\r\nform on the lower side an earth wall or counterfort covered with turf at\r\nthe toe of the slope in advance of the tip, and to make it of the\r\nhardest and largest material deposited and with a foundation upon bared\r\nsoil, as it is the part most liable to injury. This is a simple\r\nprecaution against slips, and will save its cost in lessening the\r\nexpense of repairing and trimming the slopes.\r\n\r\nAs the steam navvy or excavator has now become necessary plant upon most\r\nlarge public works, and greatly accelerates the speed at which cuttings\r\ncan be executed, always provided the excavation is not of a treacherous\r\nnature, and is in such quantity that if not so used it would have to be\r\nrun to spoil, many narrow valleys in the near future will probably be\r\nwholly or nearly closed with an earthen embankment, thereby effecting an\r\nimportant saving of time and expense; or the number of spans of a\r\nviaduct will be lessened, and only made sufficient to cross a road or\r\nallow the required waterway for a river or the discharge of any drainage\r\nor surface waters. The tendency, therefore, will be to increase the\r\nheight of embankments of earth; and in countries where the first cost of\r\nan iron, masonry, or brickwork viaduct is too great, and the use of\r\ntimber rendered necessary, earth embankments, except in treacherous soil\r\nor upon soft ground, are to be preferred to wooden pile and trestle\r\nbridges or culverts, whose average life in America, which probably now\r\npossesses as many as all other countries, is from eight to ten years,\r\nand that of timber truss bridges nine to eleven years.\r\n\r\nIn addition to other recommendations, the steam navvy usually excavates\r\nthe earth in small pieces of nearly uniform size, and as it will perform\r\nthe work of many men it may be most useful in treacherous soil, as it\r\nmay enable a cutting to be excavated in dry weather and be protected\r\nbefore the commencement of the wet season. The slopes should be\r\nexcavated in such earth as soon as possible after the gullet has been\r\nremoved so as to prevent a slip, and it may be necessary to\r\nclose-sleeper or consolidate the ground in order that the weight of the\r\nmachine can be supported upon soft ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  NOTES UPON THE LOCATION, PRESERVATION, AND PROTECTION OF SEA, ESTUARY,\r\n    RECLAMATION, CANAL, AND RESERVOIR EMBANKMENTS OF EARTH CONSTRUCTED\r\n    TO CONTAIN OR EXPEL WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first place, care should be taken in determining the site of an\r\nembankment across an estuary that there shall be no concentration or\r\nalteration of the general direction of the currents, or scouring action\r\nwill be created; for the erosive and other deleterious effects of wave\r\naction upon a shore are influenced by the angle at which they are\r\nimpelled against it. A prudent course to adopt is to carefully preserve\r\nthe usual channels by means of bridges, particularly in ground of a\r\nloose character, such as is usually found in partly landlocked waters;\r\nfor if the velocity is increased, the earth which has been deposited by\r\nthe original current being reduced or impeded resulting in the suspended\r\nmatter in the water falling to the bottom, will be subject to a force\r\nthat will again disturb and cause it to return to its previous\r\nsuspensory condition; and any disturbance of the normal currents may\r\ndestroy the equilibrium of stability and alter the flow, and when they\r\nare affected it may be most difficult to restore them to their original\r\nstate, for water will always endeavour to obtain the easiest channel.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to know the heaviest flood discharge of any river that\r\nmay flow into an estuary, the greatest depth and velocity of the river,\r\nthe normal and flood channels, their sectional area and direction, and\r\nthe extent and shape of the catchment area, so as to establish the\r\nrequired opening to give the natural waterway; for it is important not\r\nto interfere with the tidal capacity of an estuary or the volume or flow\r\nof any upland waters into the sea, as a navigable channel may become\r\nfilled with silt, especially when the shore is flat or sandbanks exist;\r\nand upon a sandy coast an embankment across an estuary with openings for\r\na navigable channel will probably cause it to become difficult to\r\nnavigate and, perhaps, impossible, without constant dredging and other\r\nworks of maintenance, as an embankment may obstruct and deflect the\r\ncurrents and prevent them carrying away the suspended matter. An open\r\nviaduct instead of an embankment is almost always to be preferred, and\r\nmay be necessary; for the power of a current to scour or move particles\r\nis greatly augmented by a small increase of the velocity, and the earth\r\nmay be in such a delicately balanced condition that any increase of\r\nscouring action may destroy the seat of an embankment.\r\n\r\nTo prevent leakage and scour of the base of an embankment near a river\r\nresting upon loose soil, curtain walls are sometimes inserted upon both\r\nsides extending to a considerable depth, thereby affording security\r\nagainst an embankment merely resting upon a mound which may gradually\r\nerode, with the result that it must finally slip and be destroyed; and\r\nit may happen, unless the foundations are carried down into impervious\r\nsoil, that water may escape underneath and undermine it; such action is\r\nobstructed by carrying the slopes a few feet below the ground so as to\r\nprevent through surface percolation.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, an embankment across an estuary with one or two openings in\r\nit is to be avoided, and it should be most carefully considered whether\r\nit will not be better to expend a larger sum and erect a pile viaduct\r\nwhich will not interfere with the currents or channels and only require\r\nordinary precautions to be taken against erosion, instead of depositing\r\nan embankment with openings at the channels and the necessary protective\r\nworks which may consist of pitching the slopes, covering them with\r\nfascines, mattress work, or sods, erecting short or long, low or high,\r\ngroynes, as the former may be ineffectual in causing a deposit or a\r\nshoal in front of the toe of the slope and in preventing scour, for in\r\nloose silty and sandy soil of considerable depth and not sufficiently\r\nfirm to resist erosion, they will probably fail by reason of the space\r\nbetween them being washed away; and a complete covering of the foreshore\r\nmay be requisite, or a protecting apron of homogeneous impermeable soil,\r\nand continuous training walls to prevent the creation of shoals: all of\r\nwhich protective works will constantly need to be repaired, and the\r\nfailure of any one may cause not only an embankment to give way but the\r\nremaining preservative works. Undoubtedly there are many estuaries upon\r\nwhich if an embankment even with many openings for channels had been\r\ndeposited, it would have failed, the soil being in such a tender state\r\nthat the least additional weight upon the surface would destroy the\r\nequilibrium. Also interference with the littoral currents is a risky\r\noperation in any but a hard rock bed as regards the foundations, quite\r\napart from injury to navigable channels. When there are numerous\r\nditches, creeks, or channels crossing the line of a proposed estuary\r\nembankment of variable stability, especially should hills be near and\r\nthe earth be so porous as to be saturated every tide, without doubt the\r\nsafer plan is to erect a low viaduct, as the old waterways will be an\r\nendless source of trouble should the ground be anything but firm clay,\r\nand interference with the currents will not be preventable, as either\r\ntheir velocity will be increased or decreased, the result being scour or\r\nfresh deposits which will affect the channels; and such alteration may\r\nchange the direction of the motion of the waters, which must be\r\nprevented in front of an estuary embankment; or waves will be created by\r\nthe water travelling and rushing over shoals, for the even configuration\r\nof the bottom is a wave lessener, and should there be a deep channel\r\nnear an estuary embankment severe wave action may be created. The piers\r\nor piles of such a viaduct should be cylindrical, thus offering no flat\r\nsurface for the waves to break against, and yet temporarily to divide\r\nthem without serious shock to a structure. When of very considerable\r\nlength, a projecting embankment deposited upon a flat shore of a tidal\r\nestuary has caused a heaping up of the water on one side at low tide,\r\nand therefore it is unequally strained. This was found to be the case\r\nwith an estuary embankment on the Scheldt, 2½ miles in length.\r\n\r\nThe form of the slope has also to be considered, but all the principles\r\nthat determine the best profile in each case of a pier or breakwater do\r\nnot necessarily apply to an embankment in an estuary. The recoil of the\r\nwaves washing away the ground in front and at the toe is particularly to\r\nbe guarded against, and the action of spray or a broken mass of water\r\nfalling upon the formation, as also the direct action of the waves. A\r\nconcave form should not be adopted throughout, as waves roll up until\r\nthey approach the top portion, when they turn over and fall upon the\r\nflatter portion and often breach it, but when the face is straight,\r\nexcepting for a few feet at the toe, the waves are diffused in\r\ntravelling up, although they proceed to a higher point upon a flat slope\r\nthan a steep one, and the recoil is greatly diminished, but with the\r\nview of avoiding direct wave action, when the ground is inclined in\r\nfront of a sea or estuary embankment, it is well to curve the lower part\r\nof the slope and to make it cycloidal to the surface of the ground and\r\nthe slope for a little distance, so as to reduce obstruction to a\r\nminimum. The method of making a level terrace or stepping the slope\r\ninstead of a curved face has the advantage of checking the rising of the\r\nsea up the face, altering its direction and acting as a wave-breaker,\r\nand also combines these effects with giving as large an area of the base\r\nas can be obtained by a curved face, and in bringing the centre of\r\ngravity of the cross section of the embankment nearer to the seat, but\r\nthe face must be securely protected. The width of the cess should\r\nincrease according to the degree of exposure. If an embankment consists\r\nof earth the slope of the cess should be from 6 to 10 to 1, or the\r\nsystem is better avoided and a continuous face adopted.\r\n\r\nShort groynes will often protect the toe of an embankment and prevent\r\nany longitudinal current undermining it. As a rule, in a tidal estuary\r\nthe cost of protecting the slopes is considerable, and more above\r\nlow-water level than below it. In adopting groynes formed of single or\r\ndouble rows of piles, in order to prevent erosion of the toe and a slip\r\nand subsidence in an estuary or sea embankment, the littoral currents\r\nmust be considered before determining their direction and position, the\r\nobject of their erection being to prevent the waves, and especially the\r\nprevailing waves, from scouring the shore, and also to cause a general\r\ndeposition of shingle, and, therefore, they are usually placed at an\r\nangle to the set of the waves, so as to cause the latter to be diffused.\r\nThe angle will vary; the best guide is to examine the effects of any\r\nthat may be erected in a similar position to that to be built. An angle\r\nof 50° to 70° with the foreshore, in a leeward direction is frequently\r\nadopted, and with respect to the distance apart, this depends\r\nprincipally upon the direction of the current and prevailing wind,\r\ncontour of the shore, degree of exposure, and the length of the groynes.\r\nWhen the whole of an open coast has to be protected, no natural defence\r\nexisting, the line of the prevailing set of the current and wind on a\r\nstraight shore can be set off at the end of a groyne, and before the\r\npoint at which it meets the foreshore another can be erected. They are\r\ngenerally successful when properly placed, and are most frequently\r\nstraight; if not, they have a concave face to the direction of maximum\r\neroding force; a convex must be avoided, as it will not permanently\r\nretain the deposits; their practical effect being that the breach is\r\nheaped up or retained upon the prevailing wind, set of current, or\r\nwind-wave side to a height of some feet above the leeward side,\r\ntherefore, a groyne should be so constructed that planks can be added to\r\nit as required. They have been proved to prevent the formation of bars\r\nwhen judiciously located, but their success greatly depends upon their\r\nproper position and direction, or in loose soils such as sand they may\r\ncause a deposit upon the windward and prevailing current side, but an\r\nerosion and falling away upon the other; and when placed in front of a\r\nreclamation embankment upon shifting sand until the ground at the back\r\nof the embankment becomes dry by the tidal waters being excluded, or the\r\nsurface is impermeably coated, they may be of comparatively little use\r\nto prevent a slip or movement of the shore; for as the tide recedes\r\nbelow the level of the toe of the slope, a seaward flow of the tidal and\r\nland waters will be created in very porous soil under the seat of an\r\nembankment, and may continue until the tide returns and rises to the\r\nlevel of the ground, thus causing the shore to be constantly changing\r\nplace and permanently established accumulation impossible. Short\r\ntransverse spurs have been adopted to lessen this action but their\r\neffect is hardly noticeable. As failure of a groyne will probably cause\r\nerosion of the foot of an embankment and a slip, a cheap and effective\r\nmeans, attested by the experience of nearly half a century, of\r\npreserving the timber from the attacks of most marine worms may here be\r\nnamed. It consists in scorching the piles, thus preventing fermentation\r\nof the sap, and immediately tarring them: also in placing the wood in\r\nthe opposite direction to that in which it grew; the latter operation\r\nhas been found to increase the durability 50 per cent., the reason, it\r\nis believed, being that the capillary tubes in the trees are so adjusted\r\nas to oppose the rising of moisture when the wood is inverted.\r\n\r\nIn excavating for an enclosure embankment, the earth should not be\r\ndisturbed nearer than is economically necessary, and a cess should be\r\nleft of about 40 to 50 feet in loose permeable soil, the width being\r\ngoverned by the character of the earth, the depth of the excavation, and\r\nthe height of the embankment. Should dredging have to be executed near\r\nan embankment, a considerable distance should be left between the toe of\r\nthe slope and the line of operations. Before commencing an estuary or\r\nenclosure embankment, it is advisable to notice whether a deposit is\r\nleft upon the shore by the incoming tide, and to ascertain whether it\r\nforms in some degree a protective covering, for if this should be the\r\ncase, any increase of the velocity of the flowing water which might be\r\ncaused by dredging or a concentration of the littoral currents should be\r\navoided, or the tidal matter in a state of suspension will not gradually\r\nsink to the ground. The tidal deposit, although the earth forming the\r\nembankment should not be tipped upon it, may also be of importance as\r\ntending to prevent or lessen any percolation of water through the\r\nforeshore and under the seat of an embankment; for instance, on the\r\nNile, the deposited slime is found to make a practically watertight\r\ncovering on the loose sand. Mr. Thomas Stevenson has also stated that,\r\naccording to the depth below the surface of low water that mud reposes,\r\nmay be approximately judged the force of wave disturbance and degree of\r\nexposure; the less the depth, the less the power possessed by the waves.\r\n\r\nIn the case of treacherous soil which circumstances compelled to be\r\npartly used in a reclamation embankment of moderate height, but which it\r\nwas found would gradually become firm by compression, rough sheet piles\r\nwith a plank at top have been inserted, giving the outline of the\r\nfinished slope of the material to be afterwards tipped upon it, the\r\npiles and planking not being removed, and, therefore, affording the\r\nrequired temporary support before the earth became consolidated and\r\nstable by compression and time.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IX. the deposition of embankments is referred to as it\r\naffects slips and subsidences in earthwork, but in an enclosure\r\nembankment an additional precaution is particularly necessary, namely,\r\nthat immediately tipping from the ends increases the velocity of the\r\nflow of the outgoing or incoming tidal water through the opening, and\r\nconsequently augments its scouring action; its deposition from a spurn\r\nhead should be abandoned, and the embankment be uniformly raised from\r\nthe base. The employment of cofferdams, piling and planking for\r\neffecting a closure is now generally discarded in favour of the\r\nhorizontal system of equally raising the height of an embankment from\r\nits base; and is even to be preferred to fascines, unless the latter are\r\nmerely used to distribute the weight over the base, to protect the\r\nsurface of a slope, or form a shield against scour either temporarily or\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\nIn previous chapters the protection of a slope is examined; here some\r\nreference is made to the particular preservation of the slopes of an\r\nestuary or reclamation embankment.\r\n\r\nWhen the protection afforded is not uniform care must be taken that\r\nalthough it makes one part secure it does not weaken another. In the\r\ncase of river-banks in a soil that is in a delicate state of\r\nequilibrium, it may occur that soon after one portion has been\r\nprotected, another is being scoured, whereas previously it was stable;\r\ntherefore, to prevent localization of the erosive action, whether on the\r\nforeshore of an estuary, reclamation, or a river-bank, and consequent\r\nslips and subsidences, the covering should extend over a considerable\r\nlength. In a sheltered position simply sodding the slopes may be\r\neffectual. Some other means of protection are a hard chalk or gravel\r\ncounterfort founded a few feet below the ground at the toe of an\r\nembankment, and a covering of similar chalk or gravel upon the slope,\r\nshould the soil be favourable. When an embankment of earth in an estuary\r\nor river is of firm soil and only requires to be made proof against wave\r\naction, stones may be simply deposited evenly upon a slope and so that\r\nthey will not be washed out, and pitching be not required, as the rough\r\nface will tend to break up the waves; but where a simple covering is\r\nadopted, whether close or comparatively loose, the slope should be\r\nstraight, as a concave form causing a recoil of the waves will in time\r\ndamage or separate the face shield. A coating of clay about 2 feet in\r\nthickness, upon a slope with stakes driven into it, and large bushy\r\nboughs of trees fixed thereon with the tops downwards, is frequently\r\nused in India as a protective cover to a crumbling bank of a river, and\r\nto training spurs erected to prevent erosion and slips. Mattresses,\r\nfascine or wattled work, besides being expensive, will slide down a\r\nslope unless well secured to it, and therefore a constant strain is\r\nproduced as in all stake-held coverings; it has also been observed by\r\nthe experienced that although so largely and successfully used in\r\nHolland and on its coast, there is very little ground swell on the Dutch\r\nshores, and that in a very exposed situation, or where heavy ground\r\nswells exist, they may not answer, and may become disintegrated by the\r\nmuch greater weight and force of the sea; and this, notwithstanding the\r\nsurface breakers of thin water and little mass broken up by the wind may\r\nproduce more visible agitation.\r\n\r\nTo prevent a river-bank slipping, and also to maintain a channel in a\r\nmuddy river, half-tide longitudinal training walls made of wattled work\r\nor fascines have been used, so as to cause the deposition of the\r\nsuspended matter in the tidal water and to gradually restore the\r\nimpaired slope and secure it from crumbling into the river. The stones\r\nbrought down by heavy floods have also been used to maintain a river\r\nchannel and protect its banks from slipping, the interstices gradually\r\nbecoming filled with mud deposited by the water when the floods subside.\r\n\r\nWhen sudden and unexpected scour of the slope or bed near an estuary\r\nembankment upon soft soil has to be immediately arrested to prevent a\r\nslip, gunny bags filled with sand afford a ready means of repairing any\r\ncavities, the interstices between the bags usually being filled rapidly.\r\nMaterial should be added as required and any concentration of the\r\nerosive currents should be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe required height has to be determined of an embankment in an estuary\r\nor the sea to prevent any flow over it or waves falling upon the inner\r\nslope; 4 to 5 feet above the highest water mark appears to be adopted in\r\nthe lower reaches of the Thames and unexposed estuaries in England. In\r\nHolland 10 to 15 feet, depending upon the degree of exposure. It is of\r\nparamount importance to prevent any waves washing over the top, as\r\ndamage and, perhaps, a breach may be caused thereby. The height of the\r\nhighest known wave must therefore be ascertained.\r\n\r\nShould the shore be sandy and loose, a characteristic of estuarine\r\naccumulations, although its usual bed may be preserved in any storm,\r\nwhen an embankment is erected the rapid and ceaseless process of wasting\r\nof the sand and loose soil by the recoil of the waves from the face may\r\nin time lay bare the toe of a steep slope and undermine it; for it has\r\nbeen found where the foundation was sand and a rubble mound, which\r\nshould be so constructed that its interstices become filled in order to\r\nmake it more solid and stable, was placed upon it, and the\r\nsuperstructure upon the mound, that the sea being resisted by a vertical\r\nwall recoiled and made the soil a quicksand, although the sand would be\r\nstable at its natural slope in still water. Obviously the less the\r\naction of the waves is impeded, the less the looseness of the sand.\r\nExperiments have shown that a slope of 1 to 1 will reflect waves, on a\r\nflatter slope they are broken. In such situations light structures,\r\noffering little resistance to the action of the waves and not causing an\r\nimpediment to the current, should be adopted in preference to a massive\r\nor solid erection; but when an embankment is necessary, it should have a\r\nlong sloping mound or foreshore upon which the waves will gradually\r\nbecome lessened and dispersed, the desired object being to prevent deep\r\nwater close to the work. When a railway or road follows the shore,\r\ninstead of erecting a retaining wall to protect an embankment, a\r\npreferable plan to adopt may be to have open trestle-work offering the\r\nleast possible obstruction, and when the formation is at the base of a\r\ncliff of variable and doubtful soil it is the best construction, as the\r\ncliff is not touched, and slips and subsidences are avoided. Should the\r\ndeposition of an artificial beach be considered necessary for the\r\npreservation of the foot of a cliff in addition to the trestle road,\r\nexperience seems to indicate that the contour affording the most\r\nprotection is one in which the slope has a flat terrace or cess at not\r\nabove three-fourths of the vertical height, another short slope, and a\r\nnearly horizontal space some distance from the foot of the cliff; but a\r\nstorm will straighten the face, and it may be impossible to economically\r\nmaintain it; however, should such a slope be assumed it should not be\r\ndisturbed. _Vide_ Chapter VI. for information respecting slopes. When a\r\nsea or an estuary retaining wall is necessary in order to prevent the\r\nslipping of an embankment consisting of loose soil, an inner dwarf wall\r\nat the edge of the formation upon the land side should be erected so as\r\nto hold the embankment in a box, and not allow any spray or water\r\npassing over the retaining wall to erode the inner portion.\r\n\r\nDeep water is generally required close to the work in railway piers or\r\njetties to enable vessels to get alongside; a heavy and monolithic wall\r\nmust consequently be erected; however, in the case of loose soil, the\r\nvertical system simply should not be used unless the foundation is\r\nthoroughly protected and below the reach or effect of wave action, and\r\nno re-entering or right angles should exist, as they increase the action\r\nof the waves. When a rubble mound is cast in and a vertical structure\r\nplaced thereon, great care must be taken that there are no holes, except\r\nthe natural interstices between the stones, and that they have a firm\r\nfoundation and sink equally, or the random mound may give way and the\r\nsuperstructure will then necessarily follow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DATA.—Sand embankment: Width of formation, 30 ft.;\r\ninclination of the slopes, 3 to 1; height of embankment from the surface\r\nof the ground, 30 ft.; depth of water, 20 ft.; height of wave, 5 ft.]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the deleterious effects of the recoil of waves may\r\nbe mentioned that a high vertical wall with a parapet has been found to\r\nendanger the toe, but when the parapet has been removed in order to\r\nallow the head of the waves to leap over the top of the work, the\r\nstructure remained stable. To prevent the recoil of the sea and the\r\nscooping away of the base and the foreshore in much exposed situations,\r\nand consequent slips and subsidences, breakwaters which simply act as\r\nwave screens, and not as wind screens, are sometimes kept a little below\r\nhigh-water mark so that the heads of the waves may have free action,\r\nalthough their onward motion is prevented. On the contrary, light open\r\nwork, such as a lattice screen, although it may somewhat lessen wave\r\naction, does not prevent it passing through.\r\n\r\nThe principal causes of the failure of vertical walls when placed upon\r\nan easily eroded foundation are by the scouring action of the recoiling\r\nwaves, therefore their magnitude should be reduced to the lowest limit:\r\nby the impounded air driving out particles of the structure: by waves\r\ntravelling upon the top, therefore their forward motion should be\r\ndeflected and rendered vertical: by the hammering action of the mass\r\ncaused by its being alternately quickly submerged and unsubmerged; the\r\npractical effect being that the foundation is intermittingly released of\r\na portion of the load and then fully strained, therefore the height of\r\nthe waves should be reduced as much as possible. Respecting the action\r\nof falling water, experiments were recently made in India, which proved\r\nthat “the greatest intensity of pressure does not exceed that due to a\r\ncolumn of water of a height equal to the fall;” the greatest intensity\r\nof pressure being always fractionally under the hydrostatic head.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the constant change of the load upon the\r\nfoundations of an embankment in tidal waters, the following calculations\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\nThe weight of a cubic foot of sea water is taken as 0·028 ton.\r\n\r\nThe weight of a cubic foot of sand is here taken as 0·056 ton.\r\n\r\nA.

At high water the weight of the embankment is reduced by the weight\r\nof the water displaced, which equals 84 tons, calculated as under.\r\n\r\nThe submerged contents of the embankment are—\r\n\r\n                                                        Cubic\r\n                                                         ft.\r\n The central portion          30 ft. × 20 ft. × 1 ft. =   600\r\n The two inclined portions  2/30 ft. × 20 ft. × 1 ft. = 1,200\r\n                              60 ft. × 20 ft. × 1 ft. = 1,200\r\n                                                        —————  Ton.

At high water a vertical pressure is imposed upon the ground beyond\r\nthe toe of the slope due to the 20 feet head of water—\r\n\r\n       20 ft. × 1 ft. × 1 ft. × 0·028 = 0·56 ton per square foot.\r\n\r\nThis latter weight and element of stability tends to prevent movement of\r\nthe ground, and also the toe of the slope, but is entirely removed at\r\nlow water when the insistent pressure at the foot of the embankment is\r\nthe greatest.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of illustrating the varying load upon the surface of\r\nthe ground caused by a rise and fall of a tide, it will be sufficient to\r\ntake one slope of the embankment.\r\n\r\nE.

The flotation power =\r\n\r\n                525 cubic ft. × 0·028 ton = 14·70 tons.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this calculation, this weight is taken as if it were\r\nspread over the whole area of the seat of the embankment at a depth of\r\n15 feet from the top =\r\n\r\n      45 ft. + 30 ft. + 45 ft. = 120 ft. × 1 ft. = 120 square ft.\r\n\r\nThe vertical pressure per square foot therefore =\r\n\r\n                   14·70/120 = 0·123 ton = 275 lbs.,\r\n\r\nwhich is equivalent to a hammering action upon the foundations of\r\n275/144 = say, 2 lbs. per square inch occurring each time the 5 feet\r\nwaves recoil.\r\n\r\nThe weight, 1·05 ton upon each slope, of the water upon that portion of\r\nthe slope which is alternately submerged and unsubmerged is not\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThis wave action may, and generally will, happen upon one side only of\r\nan embankment owing to the direction of the wind, the current, and the\r\n“fetch” of the water. In that event the lateral pressure upon the\r\nembankment will also constantly change, and there will be a varying\r\nhorizontal force from the 5 feet in height wave and its percussive\r\naction upon the slope tending to produce unequal strain and movement.\r\n\r\nThe object of the preceding calculations is to show _the variation of\r\npressures_ an embankment in an estuary or a tidal river has to sustain\r\nin addition to those of an ordinary embankment upon dry land, and its\r\nespecial liability to slip and subside; and also to demonstrate that the\r\nvertical and necessarily the horizontal pressures may be in a perpetual\r\nstate of mutation and vary considerably, and that the vertical pressure\r\nof the water outside an enclosure embankment may reach a point when the\r\nwater may be forced upward upon the land side. Usually, subsidence is\r\ngreatest in the wet seasons and at the time of the lowest tides.\r\n\r\nIn choosing between two materials for submerged work practically equal\r\nin other respects, the heavier should be preferred, as by reason of its\r\nown weight it has greater power to resist the action of the waves and\r\nscour, and the decrease of its specific gravity by the weight of the\r\nbulk of water displaced is relatively not so large.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the earthwork of canals and embankments constructed to\r\nhold water, each chapter of this book contains information relating to\r\nthe promotion of the stability of the soil, and it is not here intended\r\nto refer to the most approved methods of construction, but only to name\r\nsome points requiring attention.\r\n\r\nA barge or ordinary ship canal is usually placed at a shallow depth in\r\nthe ground and meanders through a district, avoiding deep cuttings and\r\nheavy embankments, such an undertaking as the Suez, or the Panama, ship\r\ncanals being altogether exceptional undertakings; and also the\r\nManchester Ship Canal. Some of the most treacherous soils are named in\r\nChapter II., but probably the worst earth in which a canal can be made\r\nis peat-bog land; the method of procedure is then different to that\r\nrequired in making a railway or a road, and in such soil the\r\nconstruction of a canal should be avoided, as it necessitates most\r\nexperienced and skilful treatment and extensive drainage, which causes\r\nsubsidence; difficult maintenance to preserve the channel and retain the\r\nwater of navigation, control the drainage waters, and keep unimpaired\r\nthe towing-path, which must be firmly covered throughout. Fine sand is\r\nalso an unfavourable soil as it so readily becomes a quicksand, but\r\nalmost all other earths usually met with can be so protected that\r\nfailure should be an improbable contingency, except when the cuttings\r\nare of extraordinary depth, as on the Panama Canal; the chief danger\r\nbeing when there is considerable diversity, irregularity, fissuring,\r\nlooseness, and upheaval of the soil, for varieties of almost every\r\nsurface earth may be encountered, each with its own characteristics and\r\nbehaviour when dry or water-charged, and requiring great attention,\r\nespecially at the joints, and not a few separate treatment, not only of\r\nthe soil but of the same earth in a cutting and in an embankment.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that there is not enough clayey earth to form a\r\ncanal bank, but if the whole of the excavation, except the mere surface\r\nearth, is used there is sufficient, and that it must be employed for\r\nreasons of economical construction. In such a case the clayey earth\r\nshould be deposited upon the water side, and the gravelly or sandy soil\r\non the land side and as a towing-path covering, great care being\r\nexercised that no stratification of the earth takes place, or it may\r\nseparate, and water seams be created. The bottom and slopes of a canal\r\nembankment must be covered with an impervious layer, puddle or concrete\r\nbeing most frequently used for the bottom, and puddle or a coating of\r\nwell rammed vegetable soil sown closely with grass seeds for the slopes,\r\nor stone pitching in a wide canal liable to wash: also in loose or\r\ndoubtful soil. In canal cuttings when the water is drawn off the\r\ncounter-thrust against the slopes is removed, and unless this is\r\nmaintained the earth, if in a delicate or loosened condition, may slip,\r\nas a flow may be caused of previously dammed up waters. Prior to any\r\nworks being commenced upon a canal embankment it is advisable to\r\nstrengthen it for a distance of not less than about 60 feet in length on\r\neach side of a proposed railway bridge or other structure, particularly\r\nwhen it will be subject to vibration.\r\n\r\nWater will soon find a weak place in any earthwork and, certainly, when\r\nan engineer can maintain heavy earthworks in treacherous soils in canal\r\nconstruction, where part of one slope is submerged in an embankment and\r\nthe other dry, and in a cutting part wet and part dry, he should be able\r\nto do so in any analogous situation, making due provision for vibration,\r\nthe chief disturbing agency canals are not subject to, but which is so\r\npotent in its effect upon railway earthwork.\r\n\r\nCanal and reservoir embankments are so similar as regards the stability\r\nof earthwork that they are here considered under one head. The object of\r\na canal, reservoir, or river embankment is in a desired position to hold\r\nwater without leakage, subsidence, or deterioration of the earth, or\r\nother works connected with the general construction. In dock, canal, or\r\nany earthworks made for the purpose of containing or expelling water, it\r\nis obvious the position is entirely dissimilar to that of railway works:\r\nfor whereas a slip or a subsidence in an embankment upon railway work\r\nmay be of slight moment and give comparatively little trouble or\r\nanxiety, any movement in earthwork constructed for the purposes named is\r\nof grave importance, as it may mean the destruction of the work, loss of\r\nlife and property, not only upon the site but also in the surrounding\r\ndistrict. No leakage or marked weeping of such an embankment should be\r\ndisregarded, as unless arrested it will gradually deteriorate the earth\r\nuntil the equilibrium becomes so affected that the embankment fails. As\r\na rule, upon railway works, serious slips, except in very unstable soil,\r\nsuch as drift earth, or those quickly decomposed by atmospheric\r\ninfluences, seldom occur, _vide_ Chapter II., until a year or two has\r\nelapsed, the process of disintegration from water being necessarily\r\nslower in its action, the material having an opportunity to return to\r\nits normal condition, and the surface being more equally exposed. In\r\nearthwork for hydraulic purposes, although not subject to frequent and\r\nsudden vibration, the slopes being unequally exposed and part generally\r\neither permanently or temporarily submerged or alternately wet and dry,\r\nand the top and land side unsubmerged and fully open to the action of\r\nthe weather, percolation cannot be equal and regular upon its surfaces,\r\nand slips and subsidences therefore usually occur within a short time,\r\nvarying from a few weeks to a few months; and after about a year or a\r\ncycle of seasons they are not frequent, unless the inherent design and\r\nconstruction of an embankment is faulty, permitting leakage through the\r\nsubmerged slope or bottom, pools of water to collect upon the top, and\r\nthe bank to become fissured and unequally wet or dry. Especial care\r\nshould be exercised to ensure a complete and impermeable connection with\r\nthe earth upon which it is placed.\r\n\r\nIn embankments to contain or expel water time should always be allowed\r\nfor an embankment to consolidate before the admission of the water, but\r\nin the case of a cutting the presence of the navigation water as soon\r\nafter construction as practicable may be an advantage, depending upon\r\nthe nature of the earth in each case; as it may protect the submerged\r\nportions of the slopes from the deteriorating effects of being in a\r\nconstantly changing degree of dryness and wetness, and shield them from\r\nthe sun and drying winds. Except under peculiar circumstances the\r\nunstable places will be known in a few months, and provided a canal is\r\nproperly constructed, it will not cause much trouble after six months or\r\na year from earthwork movement if the embankments and cuttings receive\r\nordinary attention, as the navigation water will quickly indicate the\r\nunconsolidated places. In clay, clay marls, clay loams, and where loamy\r\nsoil is intermixed with permeable and water-bearing strata, movement of\r\nthe earth in canals will speedily occur unless proper precautions have\r\nbeen taken in the construction, as they are seldom homogeneous.\r\n\r\nEarthworks to contain or expel water should be made proof against even\r\nimprobable deterioration and accident, and in proportion as the soil is\r\nless solid and firm it should be consolidated by ramming or other means,\r\nor be covered and protected to prevent it cracking, and only firm and\r\nbinding material should be used in canal embankments or those holding or\r\nexpelling water in order to prevent slips and subsidences. Chapter II.\r\ntreats of some conditions under which slips and subsidences may be\r\nexpected. No precaution should be omitted that will render the work\r\nsolid and uniform, and nothing should be left to chance. The location is\r\nof great importance, for the earth may vary in stability within a very\r\nshort distance, not only in character but as regards the superimposition\r\nof the strata. Upheaved and distorted beds should be avoided, and all\r\nloose and fissured earths, especially rock or other soils having more or\r\nless vertical seams: for all embankments constructed upon fissured soils\r\nare sure to cause anxiety and trouble, and will always be liable to\r\nbecome in a dangerous state from an excessive rainfall. Impermeable\r\nhorizontally deposited earth of considerable thickness is that to be\r\ndesired, or firm ground that cannot slide upon another stratum or be\r\naffected by any artificially brought addition to the percolating waters\r\nconsequent upon the construction of waterworks. Having carefully\r\nselected a site, which for waterworks purposes must almost invariably be\r\nupon high ground and may have to be upon the top cap soil of a hill and\r\nbe peculiarly exposed, the next step to guard against a slip or a\r\nsubsidence is to prepare the foundations so that no leakage or trickling\r\nof water can undermine or gradually deteriorate the seat of the\r\nembankment; and, therefore, a thorough connection between the deposited\r\nembankment and the ground must be established and the whole be prevented\r\nfrom movement.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the best available earth is one requiring careful\r\nconsideration, and it may be necessary to experiment to test the\r\ncapability of the soil to be made watertight by compression or other\r\ncomparatively inexpensive means. In some cases none may be obtainable;\r\nif so, the only course to pursue may be to consolidate the earth as much\r\nas possible, and protect it with an impermeable homogeneous and durable\r\ncovering, and one that experience has shown can be trusted to equally\r\nresist percolation. The whole practice of stable earth dam construction\r\nis comprised in the employment of homogeneous, fine, and tenacious earth\r\nuniformly deposited in thin layers, gently watered sufficiently to aid\r\nramming and consolidation, rolled, pressed, or trodden down by the\r\npassage of carts, men, or animals, and in its due surface protection.\r\nHeavy rolling is to be preferred, for it is more effective than ramming,\r\nas may be judged by the greater compression; the thickness of the layers\r\nand the weight being so regulated that it compresses the earth to its\r\nstate of maximum solidity, and does not pulverize it, as the compression\r\nis more uniform, and irregularly compact masses are not created, which\r\nnot only destroy uniformity of condition of the mass, but cause seams\r\nand veins and destroy homogeneity. After rolling, the compressed layer\r\nshould be gently watered, as the weight of the roller will have made the\r\ntop crust drier than the lower portion, unless it has been made into too\r\nmoist a state. The thickness of the layers should not exceed, when the\r\nsoil is to be heavy steam-rolled, about 6 inches in earth, and 4 inches\r\nin clay soils; they may be compressed to about four-fifths to two-thirds\r\nof their normal thickness, the degree of compression to ensure maximum\r\nsolidity indicating the openness of the original earth. In sand, the\r\nlayers when simply wetted and rammed with an ordinary rammer, should be\r\nabout 4 to 5 inches in thickness, and ordinary earth about 2 inches. The\r\nvolume of the sand will be reduced from 10 to 15 per cent. Simple\r\nramming of sand will only reduce it about 6 to about 9 per cent., and\r\nwater about 4 to 6 per cent., making the total compression as before\r\nstated, the quantity of water used being some 20 per cent. of the volume\r\nof the sand. Embankments of moderate height have been made of sand when\r\nno other earth was available, except clay loamy soil in comparatively\r\nsmall quantities, the surface of the embankment being worked by thin\r\nbars, and the loam being incorporated with the sand and made to fill its\r\ninterstices, surface protection being thus afforded, and all the usual\r\nmeans to promote consolidation being adopted. Wet earth well mixed with\r\na grout of quicklime has also been used to make a firm embankment of\r\nlittle height. Clay is not a good material to use unless it is\r\nincorporated with a considerable percentage of sand to prevent fissures\r\nand to lessen expansion. Many prefer the sand to be in the proportion of\r\nabout two-thirds of the mass, only one-third being clay; the soil being\r\nthen a loam, and cannot be classed as a clay.\r\n\r\nThere is much diversity of opinion as to the relative value of a central\r\npuddle wall or protection of the slope and toe. Such a wall is placed in\r\nthe centre, not only to give support to an earth embankment and prevent\r\nany through leakage, but also to keep the puddle in a uniformly moist\r\ncondition, and therefore to prevent it fissuring and cracking from\r\nexposure to the sun or air. In an embankment erected upon an earth\r\nfoundation it may be advantageous and warrant the expense, but when the\r\nembankment of earth is placed upon rock it should not be erected, for it\r\nis impossible to make a watertight joint between rock and clay puddle,\r\nand should it be placed in a rock trench leakage will not be prevented\r\nby it, and water will accumulate when it does not at once pass through\r\nthe seat of an embankment until the surface of its base becomes\r\nsoftened, and the whole mass almost worthless either as a means of\r\nsupport or of prevention of through percolation; and, moreover, there is\r\nthe danger that the clay will draw away from the sides of the rock. What\r\nis wanted is, as it were, to insert as far as the top of an embankment\r\nan artificial rock having a thorough connection with the foundation,\r\nconsequently a Portland cement concrete wall should be adopted in such a\r\ncase and not one consisting of clay puddle. Two great advantages of a\r\nPortland cement concrete central support over that of a clay puddle wall\r\nare that it does not settle and the weight is evenly distributed,\r\nwhereas a puddle wall in subsiding may draw away from the earth of the\r\nembankment and cause cavities and cracks and consequent leakage. The\r\nchief consideration is to produce an embankment having impermeability,\r\nsolidity, and homogeneity, and a thorough connection at the foundations;\r\nand as the central puddle wall system rarely does so, and usually only\r\nunder circumstances which would probably hardly warrant the expense of\r\nits adoption, it is in a state of obsolescence; and should central wall\r\nsupport be necessary, which may not infrequently be the case, Portland\r\ncement concrete is being adopted in its place, a solid and durable\r\nmaterial being used instead of one varying in shape and size, according\r\nto its state of dryness or wetness, liable to fissure, and incapable of\r\nbeing permanently and firmly joined to any material. This system may be\r\ndescribed as one of arresting the percolation of water in the interior\r\nof an embankment; but the great aim is to prevent any percolation into\r\nthe mass, as when once a passage is made the water will escape along the\r\nline of least resistance, and a fissure become a cavity, a cavity a\r\nbreach.\r\n\r\nThe protection of the slope and toe has for its object the prevention of\r\nany percolation into the mass, and it may effect all that is requisite,\r\nbut its efficiency and completeness much depends upon the preparation\r\nand deposition of the layers during the construction of an embankment,\r\nand also the time that can be allowed for consolidation, so as to\r\nprevent any cracking or fissuring of the face covering from settlement\r\nof the embankment. It is obvious in the case of a reservoir embankment\r\nor a slope alternately submerged and unsubmerged, that an exposed clay\r\npuddle covering cannot be used, as heat or the sun’s rays will cause it\r\nto crack, although if constantly wet it would succeed. A puddled clay\r\ncovering with a broken stone bed placed upon it to receive dry or\r\nmortar-set stone pitching has been frequently adopted; a simple cement\r\nconcrete facing about 6 to 12 inches in thickness, depending upon the\r\ndepth of the water and the nature of the soil, or in conjunction with an\r\nasphalt coating of ordinary thickness. In the two latter cases care must\r\nbe taken that they do not separate from the embankment either from the\r\nforce of pent-up water, frost, or shrinking of the earth embankment.\r\n\r\nAs any perforation of the surface must be prevented, in certain\r\ndistricts the covering should be capable of resisting the attacks of\r\nrodents and crustacea, and, therefore, a stone pitched or concrete\r\ncovered slope is necessary, or the puddle towards the surface must be\r\nwell incorporated with small stones or ashes or other tough material. In\r\nEuropean countries the effects of the burrowing of rats may be\r\ninsignificant, but in warmer climates, as, for instance, on the coast of\r\nCoromandel and in some parts of Bengal, where rats may measure as much\r\nas 2 feet in length, their attacks are not to be disregarded with\r\nimpunity.\r\n\r\nThe causes of failure of water-containing embankments afford an\r\nindication of the direction in which especial care should be exercised\r\nin their construction. Assuming a reservoir embankment to be of the\r\nnecessary form and bulk, and to be properly constructed, the principal\r\ncauses of failure are as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. Leakage along the line of a culvert or pipe passing through the lower\r\nportion of an embankment.\r\n\r\n2. Leakage under the seat of an embankment.\r\n\r\n3. Water overflowing the top and eroding the land slope and so\r\ndestroying the equilibrium.\r\n\r\n4. Bursting of springs over the site. _Vide_ Chapter XII. on “boils” in\r\nloose soils.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first, the most frequent cause of the failure of a\r\nwater enclosure embankment; the culvert or outlet passages have been\r\nrendered unnecessary by conducting the waters in a tunnel passage under\r\nthe seat of the embankment and without interfering with it; but this\r\nmethod is expensive. One of the causes of failure is the weight of the\r\nembankment owing to unequal settlement producing a breach in a culvert,\r\nthe probable result of insecure foundations or want of a firm concrete\r\nbase to the culvert to evenly distribute the weight; or it being placed\r\nupon clay puddle, which should never be done; or the embankment being\r\nconstructed without due care. All culverts should be sufficiently large\r\nfor a man to easily pass through and should be equally watertight within\r\nand without, for a leakage from the culvert to the bank is equally\r\ndangerous, and means should be provided so that it can be closed in\r\nshort lengths. Reports on the temporary failures of reservoir\r\nembankments almost invariably state, failure occurred from water\r\npenetrating between the puddle and the culvert, from water percolating\r\nbetween the rock foundation and the central puddle wall, or the\r\nembankment gave way as water issued through interstices in it caused by\r\nsettlement of the masonry outlet passage.\r\n\r\nCareless construction has often been shown by inspection to be the\r\nreason of so many embankments yielding along the line of the culvert;\r\nbut when the latter is properly designed and built it seldom causes a\r\ntemporary failure of a well-made reservoir embankment. Respecting the\r\nsecond cause of failure, it generally proceeds from want of care in\r\nthoroughly binding an embankment to the solid ground and protecting the\r\ntoe; by “boils” in the foundations; or by a porous earth seam, such as\r\nfine sand, existing under the stratum upon which the embankment is\r\nerected becoming a quicksand on flowing water reaching it.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the third, it may be said that it is not a frequent\r\ncause of failure, as provision is almost always made to prevent it, but\r\nit may occur in a reservoir embankment from extraordinary circumstances,\r\nor in a much less degree from sufficiently high waves being generated\r\nupon a lake or impounding reservoir that the top of the bank may be\r\nloosened, and the water dash over it and erode the land slope, and\r\nconvert it into a kind of tail-race; tarpaulins have been temporarily\r\nlaid upon the surface on an emergency to protect a soft place, also sand\r\nbags and planking to prevent an overflow. In an embankment erected for\r\nsuch a purpose the top width is more severely strained, consequent upon\r\nthe greater exposure, than in a reservoir embankment, and the height\r\nmust be sufficient to prevent water passing over it.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the fourth cause of failure, “boils” in loose soil and\r\nthe bursting of springs are referred to in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nWhen a reservoir is emptied the weight of the water on its bottom is\r\nremoved, but the load from the embankment is the same, and should the\r\nground be soft the embankment may subside towards the reservoir and the\r\nbed be uplifted; hence it may be advisable not to draw off the water\r\nunless the bottom is weighted or movement prevented.\r\n\r\nDue regard of the different causes of failure herein enumerated and care\r\nin construction, will reduce to a minimum the probability of a slip or a\r\nsubsidence in an earth embankment erected to contain or expel water.\r\n\r\nThe temporary or permanent diversion of rivers or streams being so often\r\nnecessary in public works, a few paragraphs are here devoted to it so\r\nfar as regards earthslips and subsidences. If it be possible when the\r\nsoil is very porous and incapable of retaining water, it is advisable\r\nnot to divert a river.\r\n\r\nSome of the most vulnerable places in a newly-formed river-bank are:\r\n\r\nThe ends that join it to the old bank or to the land, to which it should\r\nbe thoroughly connected.\r\n\r\nThe toe of the slope and seat, which should be tied into the bed of the\r\nriver or be well protected by making the slope flat towards the base.\r\n\r\nAny abrupt bends or angles should always be avoided as they increase\r\nerosive action.\r\n\r\nThe wind and water line which requires especial protection.\r\n\r\nProvided these points are remembered and the usual precautions taken in\r\nforming a river-bank to make it thoroughly sound and homogeneous, a slip\r\nor subsidence of serious moment is improbable.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the sandy bed of a river and to prevent the banks\r\nslipping and subsiding, it may be necessary to guard against scour of\r\nthe bed and consequently of the toe of the banks. Stone thrown in will\r\nsettle and compress the bed by weighting and consolidation. By\r\nperiodical depositions the sand becomes more protected and the quantity\r\nof stone required is reduced, but especial care should be taken to\r\npreserve the normal bed, to offer no obstruction, and not to cause\r\nwhirlpools or to interfere with the current except to direct and train\r\nit, or the erosive action so created will cause movement. Stones simply\r\ncast in and allowed to sink and find a permanent bed until the regular\r\nsurface of the bottom of a river is so reached, have been proved in many\r\ninstances to be a sure protection in sandy soils provided eddies do not\r\nexist. The preservation of the slopes is particularly referred to in\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  NOTES UPON THE FAILURE OF DOCK AND OTHER WALLS FROM A FORWARD MOVEMENT\r\n    OF THE EARTH FILLING OR BACKING.—CONSIDERATION OF THE CAUSES OF SUCH\r\n    ACTION AND SOME PREVENTIVE AND REMEDIAL MEASURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most serious consequences often result from slips or “boils” of sand\r\nor loose soil during the construction of docks, and from the sliding\r\nforward or subsidence of quay walls, as in addition to the great expense\r\nof restoring the damaged wall must be considered the loss of receipts\r\ncaused either by delay in opening the docks or from interference with\r\nthe traffic. In this chapter no attempt is made to lay down rules and to\r\ndeclare that if they are followed failures from pressure, subsidence, or\r\na slip of earth, can be obviated by careful attention to them. Many of\r\nthe most renowned engineers and contractors throughout the world, whose\r\nscientific attainments and practical knowledge are universally and\r\ndeferentially acknowledged by those competent to form a judgment, have\r\nhad anything but pleasant experiences in the construction of docks and\r\nsimilar works.\r\n\r\nThe two banes of dockworks may be said to be:—\r\n\r\n1. Defective foundations.\r\n\r\n2. “Boils,” or the rushing up of loose soil and water in the\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nTo say that a failure of a dock-wall cannot but be the result of\r\ndefective engineering is a statement which it would be difficult to\r\nsubstantiate. To disturb the earth below the required depth of the\r\nfoundations at intervals over the area of such works in treacherous\r\nsoils in order to ascertain its character would simply be to offer a\r\ngeneral invitation to it to commence movement, _vide_ p. 208. It would\r\nbe worthy to rank with the erudite report of a local committee formed to\r\ndeclare the best means of preventing floods in a district, which, after\r\ndeep consideration reported: “That the committee were of opinion the\r\nfloods would be permanently removed provided the engineer diverts all\r\nrivers, streams, watercourses, and ditches, to the next valley, and\r\ncloses the up-stream hole in the hill, or causes the water to be\r\ndischarged elsewhere, and reduces the rainfall within the limits\r\nrequired from time to time by the inhabitants of the district.”\r\n\r\nInasmuch as it is impracticable to ascertain the exact character and\r\ncondition of any earth over a large area in such a location as that\r\nusually occupied by a dock, and to be certain that no unstable seams\r\nexist, and as the forces of nature are infinitely more powerful than\r\nthose of man, it cannot be said that a failure is absolutely impossible.\r\nAll that can be done is to render improbable any slip or subsidence by\r\nthe employment of every known means to promote stability justified by\r\nthe importance of the work and with a due regard to economy.\r\n\r\nDock-works are peculiarly liable to slips and subsidences because of\r\ntheir position necessarily being near to the sea, an estuary, river, or\r\nlake, and therefore in usually treacherous superficial soil of an\r\ninsecure, water-charged character. The foundations are also at but\r\ncomparatively little depth below the lowest water-level, and although\r\nthey are not subject to the frequent vibration railway cuttings and\r\nembankments have to withstand, they are jarred by blows from vessels and\r\nfalls of heavy goods, vibration from cranes and machinery, and also are\r\nliable to be suddenly and unevenly surcharged. The earth backing may\r\nalso become quickly water-charged, and a force caused by the tide\r\nvarying in height has to be considered in earth embankments for docks or\r\nreclamation purposes, particularly in sandy or loose soil, namely, that\r\nof the foundations being “blown” up by the upward pressure of the tidal\r\nor permanent head of water above the level of the bottom of the\r\nfoundation; thus inside an enclosure embankment, or cofferdam, a depth\r\nof water of 30 feet would give an upward pressure of, say, 0·85 ton per\r\nsquare foot, and when the excavation has extended to a depth of 30 feet\r\nan insistent natural weight of a column of sand 1 foot square upon the\r\nfoundation has been removed by the excavation equal to 1·65 ton, _vide_\r\nChapter V. Thus the upward and relieved pressure 0·85 + 1·65 equals 2·50\r\ntons per square foot, 0·85 ton of which constantly varies. It is obvious\r\nthat in very permeable soils, such as sand, the hydrostatic pressure\r\nwill be most felt, and should the range of tide be considerable the\r\nstrain upon the earth will change and an active disturbing force be\r\nconstantly present. This varying disturbing agent must be seriously\r\nconsidered in all dockwork or excavation near the sea or a tidal river,\r\nand also approximate to water, for there will always be danger of the\r\nwater percolating, and when the foundations are not sufficiently deep of\r\ntheir being undermined. The weight and depth must therefore be\r\nsufficient to balance or exceed any upward pressure of the water in the\r\nsoil due to its head level. The bottom of the foundation will almost\r\ninvariably be below the depth at which water is usually found in the\r\nlocality, and it should not be forgotten that sooner or later the earth\r\nupon which dock-walls rest is nearly certain to become wet and perhaps\r\nsaturated, and that when saturated any additional water must flow away.\r\nIn sandy or loose soils this may become dangerous. Care must also be\r\ntaken in loose soil that it is not loaded by any temporary works so as\r\nto force the earth in any direction, or a slip will occur and any\r\ntrenches may become filled, and every effort should be made to cause\r\nequal loading and pressure and to prevent unequal settlement.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the site of a dock is generally confined within narrow\r\nlimits such as railway connection, roads, location of the want of dock\r\naccommodation, currents, the proper position of the entrances, &c., &c.;\r\nnevertheless the nature of the soil should be considered, for upon a\r\ntidal river a few hundred feet one way or other may cause the works to\r\nbe upon various kinds of earth each more or less treacherous, and when\r\nintermixed perhaps more unstable. Even upon one side of a comparatively\r\nnarrow river the earth may be in a much more stable condition than upon\r\nthe other; and when an old watercourse or a dry ditch passes across the\r\nsite of a dock it must not be disregarded, as failures and damage have\r\noccurred because the same section of a wall was continued throughout. It\r\nis then necessary to adopt a system of construction suitable for softer\r\nor less stable ground, and especially so if the wall has to be built\r\nupon a firm stratum overlying sand, as a diminution in the thickness of\r\nthe bed may cause a settlement and the wall to be pushed forward; for\r\nthere is always danger in sandy soils, unless the superimposed layer is\r\nof considerable thickness, that the latter may be pierced and the whole\r\nsite be in jeopardy from a flow of the sand.\r\n\r\nIt may be that a dock must be built at a particular place, although the\r\nground may be full of springs, the beds inclined, or a level stratum\r\noverlies an inclined bed of rock or softer earth incapable of standing\r\nat any but a flat slope, the whole being an unstable mass, for the\r\ndeposits may extend to such considerable depths that to go below them is\r\nimpracticable; however, uniform weighting and consolidation by the\r\ndeposition of firm soils having insoluble particles will generally make\r\nit firmer, and by compression and admixture will ultimately cause the\r\nground to be more solid. It should be loaded as long as possible, and\r\nthe material be deposited beyond the site so as to prevent the outside\r\nand less consolidated earth slipping upon the works, and as it will be\r\ndisturbed by the loaded portion having subsided it may require slight\r\nsupport upon the lower portion of the slope. When the settlement over\r\nthe base and the slopes to the original bed is equal and regular and\r\ncare is taken that the soft soil cannot run, by a due protection of its\r\nsurface it can be built upon. The rise of the mud in front and for some\r\ndistance from the wall is generally from about one-third to one-half of\r\nits subsidence when loaded. The rate of sinking and uplifting of the\r\nsoil should be noticed, and whether it is equable and the depth to which\r\nsettlement extends is the same over a considerable area and practically\r\nceases at a certain depth.\r\n\r\nWhere a dry dock had to be made upon soft fine sand, Portland cement\r\nconcrete has been successfully used to cover the whole site. In such\r\nsoils, to avoid the danger of the bottom being blown up when a dock is\r\nempty, and has not the counterbalancing weight of a ship, arrangements\r\nshould be made so that sufficient water is let in to counteract the\r\nuplifting force. If it can be avoided it is advisable not to erect a\r\ngraving dock upon very porous earth, as the expense of an impervious\r\nlining, whether of Portland cement concrete or clay puddle, and of\r\nkeeping it dry will be considerable; and when unequal settlement takes\r\nplace a run of the soil may occur and a slip of earth cause it to become\r\nfissured and separated, especially in an estuary or bay with headlands,\r\nas natural springs may make the sand a quicksand. Much depends upon the\r\nhead, if the water comes from the adjoining hills it may be so great as\r\nto prevent any but a strongly constructed dock, acting as a watertight\r\nbox, being successful. The bearing power of the soil will also be\r\npractically the same whether the foundations are a few feet or at a\r\nconsiderable depth, as the head will be sufficient to make the springs\r\nissue, and therefore disturb the earth.\r\n\r\nThe drainage of the site requires to be carefully deliberated, and no\r\nrules can be laid down, but the flow of all surface water and springs\r\nshould be controlled. The chief aim should be rather to prevent water\r\nreaching the site than to allow it to be present and then pump it away,\r\nhence it is well to have the deepest sump and all water-raising\r\napparatus, if possible, outside the area of the works of art and in the\r\ndirection of the land or river flow. The first operation in draining the\r\nsite is to construct the necessary surface drains around it and also the\r\nsinking of a sump, cylinder, or wells where required, which to be\r\neffectual must be some few feet deeper than the lowest level of the\r\nworks of construction; but the depth should be no more than is\r\nabsolutely requisite, as the greater the lift of a pump the less the\r\nefficiency; care being taken that the bottom of the sump is sufficiently\r\nlow that water gravitates to it, and that the pumping apparatus is at\r\nsuch a height that it cannot be “drowned.” When the soil is of so loose\r\na character that pumping will cause it to “run,” the bottom can be\r\nclosed and holes made in the ring and water pumped in through them, and\r\nin addition coarse gravel or broken stone can be inserted to act as a\r\nfilter. The act of drainage may cause soil that has been full of springs\r\nto be entirely free from them, and cannot but always tend to\r\nconsolidation, if only because of settlement and the interstices or\r\nfissures being less occupied by water or being reduced in size. In loose\r\nsoils, especially at the commencement of pumping operations, it is\r\nadvisable that it be not very rapid, as a quick change of condition may\r\ncause the ground to be disturbed too much, whereas slow pumping may\r\nclear the water as effectually and enable the soil to settle to its new\r\nstate. The location of the sump should be at or about the lowest level\r\nof the ground well away from any wall or the dock area, and on the line\r\nof the greatest flow of the land waters or natural watercourse, thus,\r\ndealing with them before they reach the site of the works.\r\n\r\nIn loose and almost all earth the foundations should be covered up\r\nquickly so as to preserve the natural condition of the soil. It is also\r\nimportant to offer every possible support to the earth to prevent\r\ninitial movement, and slight assistance may afford the required\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nUnless there are cogent reasons to the contrary, the excavation for\r\ndock-walls is better executed in trenches, the frames of which being\r\nstruck as the work progresses can be used again; the wall can thus be\r\nsupported by the earth on either side, and no lateral thrust is brought\r\nupon the wall until it has set, and therefore the danger of bringing,\r\nperhaps, the greatest strain upon it when in an imperfectly solid\r\ncondition is obviated, the back and top of the wall being protected from\r\nthe weather, and any movement or slip of the earth prevented; hence a\r\nwall should act as quickly as practicable as a monolithic mass, and the\r\nmaterial forming it be thoroughly bonded and set in Portland cement or\r\nthe best hydraulic lime mortar, or be wholly of strong Portland cement\r\nconcrete.\r\n\r\nThe trench system of constructing dock-walls, covered ways, and all work\r\nbelow ground is the safest to adopt, and in loose soils or clay that\r\nexpands and is quickly affected by atmospheric influences, and where\r\nthere are buildings or the ground is weighted, the erection of side\r\nwalls in trenches, and then the completion of the invert or arch is\r\noften the only way in which the work can be executed. Even should the\r\nformation be rocky, and the beds be inclined towards the site, the short\r\n15 to 20 feet in length trench system is the best to adopt; and it may\r\nbe advisable or necessary to work day and night in order that the ground\r\nmay be left exposed for the least possible time and as machine mixed\r\nPortland cement concrete walls can be erected much quicker than masonry\r\nor brickwork, in such situations it is the best material to use. The\r\nexcavation for the walls should be confined within the smallest limits,\r\nbut no under-cutting should be allowed in the excavation trenches, or\r\nthe portion undercut may strain the upper part and cause it to slip and\r\nsubside.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VIII. soft soil or weak ground is referred to, and as in\r\ndockworks this so frequently occurs, the necessity of making every\r\nreasonable provision against undue settlement is apparent. In such\r\nfoundations the weight upon them should be as equable as possible, for\r\nany excess of load will cause subsidence at that place, and a large\r\nbearing area is required which may not be easy to obtain, except by\r\nincreasing the area at the back, as the face must be nearly straight, or\r\nonly slightly curved, to enable vessels to get alongside, but the wall\r\nshould not be the heavier in front as it will aid an overturning\r\nmovement. Any dredging operations should be effected at such a distance\r\nthat the stability of a wall cannot be impaired, or a slip of earth may\r\noccur, as the bared soil may commence to “blow” or run consequent upon\r\nthe dredging having relieved the ground of weight and, perhaps, removed\r\nan impervious covering. A row of sheet piles inserted before dredging is\r\ncommenced, if well supported in front, may be sufficient to prevent\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nIn dockwork, the margin allowed to resist lateral strain being\r\nconsiderable, walls seldom fail by being fractured from excess of\r\nlateral pressure; but either by vertical or lateral pressure causing\r\nsubsidence or the whole of a wall to slide forward upon the foundations;\r\nand not from defective form, workmanship, or materials; but from a\r\ncompressive strain upon the face of a wall caused by a force tending to\r\noverturn it; and, as a rule, when a wall inclines towards the face very\r\nlittle more pressure will upset it. Generally the foundations are\r\nsufficiently firm to support the insistent load, and the chief cause of\r\nfailure or undue movement is principally the result of slipping forward\r\nand the want of adhesion of the soil and frictional resistance of the\r\nwall upon it. How can this forward movement of the earth be prevented?\r\nBefore proceeding to name some means that can be employed it is\r\nadvisable to remember the cardinal principles of the construction of\r\ndock-walls to resist lateral thrust, because a structure may be so\r\ndesigned as to induce a movement or a slip of earth. They may be briefly\r\nstated to be as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. That the maximum weight is not required in the front of a dock-wall\r\nbut at the back, in order that the centre of gravity may be as far\r\ndistant from the face as the exigencies of sound construction will\r\nallow.\r\n\r\n2. That the centre of gravity should be as low as possible consistent\r\nwith the due strength of the upper portions of a wall so as to increase\r\nthe resistance to an overturning movement.\r\n\r\n3. To have an equal load upon the ground, and to guard against any extra\r\nstrain upon the foundations near the face of a wall consequent upon the\r\nlateral thrust, which has a tendency to cause a wall to overturn.\r\n\r\n4. Particularly to provide against any forward movement either by having\r\ndeep foundations, protective works at the base of a wall, or by other\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—It is obvious, in order to counteract a sliding movement, that\r\n  the foundations should be at right angles to the face batter at the\r\n  base, and not be horizontal. These inclining inward foundations,\r\n  however, can only conveniently extend for a portion of the width in\r\n  very thick walls, but throughout in those of less thickness. When no\r\n  support is possible in the front of a wall, such as an extra depth\r\n  of foundations, an invert, or a firm connection between the lower\r\n  portion of opposite dock-walls, &c., it is advisable to counterfort\r\n  the wall.\r\n\r\n5. That the wall should be as symmetrical in form as possible,\r\nparticularly upon a soft foundation, in order to ensure equal loading\r\nand settlement, and that it subsides without a forward movement or\r\ntilting.\r\n\r\n6. That it should be homogeneous, especially when the strata dip toward\r\nit, sufficient provision being made to prevent any lodgment of water at\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\n7. That it must have the usual margin of stability above the sufficient\r\nweight and mass to resist the calculated lateral thrust of the earth and\r\nthat caused by it being surcharged by buildings, goods, cranes, or\r\nmachinery, which may cause unequal and sudden loading and strain; and to\r\nwithstand in sidelong ground the additional lateral thrust caused by the\r\ninclination of the strata.\r\n\r\n8. That the face be sufficiently perpendicular to allow ships to lay\r\nclose alongside, and that it be of the required hardness to resist the\r\nrubbing of vessels, and especially of barges.\r\n\r\n9. That, when a wall is constructed of different materials, a complete\r\nunion is effected of all the parts, and anything tending to make it of\r\nvarying strength, unless exceptionally required, should be avoided; such\r\nas the junction of lime concrete with Portland cement concrete, or the\r\nemployment of the hardest and strongest bricks or stones and their\r\nconnection by means of a weak mortar.\r\n\r\n10. That the resultant of the vertical and lateral pressure of the wall,\r\nwhether surcharged or not, falls well within the middle third of the\r\nwall at its base. If not, the foundations will be unequally strained.\r\n\r\n11. That any mooring posts or bollards, gate or sluice chamber machinery\r\nbe so placed and secured that they cause no serious additional strain\r\nupon a dock-wall.\r\n\r\n12. In soils that expand, such as the clays, dry backing should be\r\nprovided of absorbent and even material capable of compression\r\nsufficiently to relieve a wall of severe pressure from the expansion of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n13. That selected material be used for the backing, and that it be\r\nraised in layers inclining in a direction opposite to that of the wall,\r\ncare being taken that it cannot become water-charged.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly referred to a few of the chief principles of construction\r\nof dock-walls, the connection between them and slips and subsidence in\r\nearthwork has to be considered.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom a dock-wall fails from insufficient mass or incorrect\r\ndesign. The chief element of danger being imperfect foundations causing\r\na forward movement of the wall, which may either result in a bulge or a\r\ncomplete advance of the whole section for a considerable distance, and\r\nusually when this forward motion commences it extends for a long length,\r\nand has an apex, and is not only of a disastrous character, but also\r\ndifficult to quickly and permanently restore to a state of stability.\r\nThe wall may be most carefully designed, and be amply sufficient to\r\nresist lateral thrust due to the pressure of the earth and any load upon\r\nthe quay, and nevertheless, although as a wall it is perfect and\r\nunimpaired, the whole mass from want of sufficient depth of the\r\nfoundations or hold in the ground frequently slides forward: and there\r\nare few extensive docks that have been constructed in any but the\r\nfirmest earth that have been free from such a mishap. In order to limit\r\nthe extent of a sliding movement, it might be said, reduce the lengths\r\nof the wall and make the unsupported from the front length as short as\r\npossible, and in doubtful earth it may be advisable to abandon all long\r\nstraight walls and adopt the system of short jetties, with ample width\r\nat their heads for unloading and loading operations, for a vessel to lay\r\nalongside, for store-house room, and a double line of rails and the\r\nnecessary free action of machinery; so as to avoid the expense of slips\r\npushing forward the wall: but to do this may almost ruin the commercial\r\nprospects of a dock, for naturally owners and captains of ships will\r\nsend their vessels where the greatest facilities are offered and the\r\nimpediments to movement the least. Local considerations in each case\r\nalone can determine the shortest required clear length. However, in\r\ndesigning jetties to dock-walls it is advisable to so construct them\r\nthat they may act also as face counterforts to a wall, and be located at\r\nany apparently weak place so as to give support where it is needed.\r\n\r\nThe chief danger is from variation of the earth in the foundations and\r\nthe existence of thin seams of an unstable character, or fissures in\r\nrocky soil allowing percolation of water, most difficult, if not\r\nbordering upon the impossible, to discover unless by trial pits and\r\nborings over the whole area of the site of a dock, which would be a most\r\nunwise proceeding, as has been previously named in this chapter. The\r\nmarvellous labours of geologists and others have enabled an accurate\r\nopinion to be formed of the locality and the depth at which water and\r\ncertain minerals are to be found and also to indicate the earths in\r\nwhich fissures and seams are frequent; but it must ever be impossible\r\nfor man to absolutely state that no unstable seams or veins exist over a\r\nconsiderable area of ground, more especially in the superficial beds\r\nupon which a dock-wall has to be constructed, although the probability\r\nof their presence may be determined with some degree of precision. The\r\nimportance of a complete examination of the ground of the site and\r\nneighbourhood is imperative, and particularly of any cuttings and\r\nembankments in the locality.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter II. many conditions of earth are referred to in which slips\r\nand movement are probable, but that now under consideration is usually\r\ncaused by a wall resting upon seams or weak veins of unstable soil;\r\ntherefore, there is danger when a comparatively thin seam of soft slimy\r\nearth interposes between the hard bed upon which the foundations may\r\nrest and one below the vein; for, but a little additional moisture may\r\nsufficiently lubricate the surface to enable the firm bed to slide upon\r\nit, the frictional resistance being thereby so reduced that movement\r\nresults. Similarly, in the case of a seam of gravel overlying clay, the\r\nfirm gravel bed may slide upon the clay: the foundations should then be\r\ncarried down to the clay. Piles at the base driven into the gravel will\r\nbe of little use; in fact, for permanent work, they are now almost\r\nabandoned except for jetties, cills, aprons, dolphins, &c., for\r\nuniformity of support is very difficult to obtain in pilework and cannot\r\nbe proved to exist; but piles may be useful to help to sustain a\r\nstructure until it has taken its permanent bearing and is in possession\r\nof its full strength. For purposes of permanent support they are\r\nsomewhat unreliable, for failures have happened because of their\r\nweakness, and walls have consequently been overturned; their chief use\r\nis as auxiliary temporary aids to lateral stability, such as confining\r\nconcrete or lessening the percolation of water. However, the earth may\r\nbe in such a condition that it cannot retain them in position when they\r\nare strained, then they are useless for lateral support. Their\r\nresistance to horizontal strain varies much with the nature of the soil\r\nand not necessarily according to its cohesive power; for instance,\r\nexperiments have shown sand to afford the greatest horizontal\r\nresistance; clay, less; and in loose ashes the power is further reduced.\r\n\r\nWhen a clay stratum is thin and overlies gravel or sand, provided the\r\nnecessary precautions are taken that the sand does not “boil,” it is\r\nbetter to have the foundations upon the underlying gravel or sand, as\r\nthe layer of clay may bulge and slide upon the gravel and thrust out the\r\nwall. Should a stratum of clay be superimposed upon another of similar\r\ncharacter, it will always be in a damp state conducive to lateral\r\ninstability, as there will be two sliding surfaces, and the upper may be\r\nforced forward and carry the wall with it, and should a seam of sand be\r\ninterposed it may become “quick” and flow away. In such cases the\r\nfoundations should extend to a safe depth in the lower clay stratum or\r\nbe below the unstable seam, and when the depth of silt or unstable soil\r\noverlying a firm bed, as rock, is considerable, the well system can be\r\nadopted, provided the bottom is levelled. As seams, weak veins, and\r\nfissures are so frequently met with the examples might be continued\r\nalmost _ad infinitum_. To ascertain whether they exist and their\r\nlocation is one of the primary precautions to be observed, as dock-walls\r\nusually fail from bulging or slipping forward, causing fracture or\r\noverturning.\r\n\r\nAdditional weight or increase of the thickness of a wall may not suffice\r\nto arrest movement of the base or forward motion of the earth. To place\r\nthe foundations at a greater depth may be impracticable, although it may\r\nbe the best method of restoration; it then becomes necessary to insert\r\nan invert or strut between the walls in a narrow dock, or in a large\r\ndock to attempt to remove the unstable seam in front of the wall and\r\nprevent movement of the vein by a curtain-wall, additional weight, or\r\nother means of consolidation; or by removing the solid backing, draining\r\nthe back, and the erection of a timber platform instead of the earth, so\r\nthat it reposes at its natural slope without creating a thrust upon the\r\nwall; or by having packed rubble filling instead of ordinary solid\r\nbacking so as to remove or lighten the lateral pressure upon it, by\r\ndraining the ground at the back; or by counterforts from the foundation\r\nto the ground level, at the front of the wall, especial care being taken\r\nto prevent their parting from the main wall.\r\n\r\nThe arched wall system is sometimes adopted for docks, but as it\r\nrequires a longer time to construct, and is obviously more liable to be\r\ndamaged from settlement and by pressure of the earth and the failure of\r\njoints and weak places, solid walls of Portland cement concrete with a\r\nhard face are more to be desired; as in such situations a monolithic and\r\nequally resisting mass is required, weight and mass being of importance.\r\nThe relative bulk of materials for a certain expenditure should be\r\nconsidered, as it may happen that greatly increased weight and mass may\r\nbe obtained for no extra expense by the employment of a certain\r\nsubstance. Combinations of brickwork and masonry and concrete are being\r\nabandoned in favour of one homogeneous material throughout, and no yet\r\nknown aggregate fulfils this condition for such work as Portland cement\r\nconcrete, owing to the difficulty of making secure and perfect joints,\r\nalthough hard brick facing may be necessary to protect the face from\r\nwear by the rubbing of vessels. By a judicious adoption of material for\r\na dock-wall in order to give it weight and mass, and sufficiently deep\r\nfoundations, neither counterforts nor other special means of protection\r\nagainst failure may be required, and slips and movements of the earth\r\nmay be prevented.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a stratum of soft soil of considerable depth overlying a\r\nfirm foundation, dock and quay-walls upon arches, not exceeding about 30\r\nfeet span, have been successfully erected upon wells sunk in or to the\r\nsolid ground, when by reason of the cost it was impracticable to carry a\r\nsolid wall to the firm ground; and no slipping, sliding forward, or\r\nsubsidence has occurred.\r\n\r\nTo prevent movement of the earth at the back of a wall pushing or\r\nfracturing it and being the cause of a slip, it may be well to briefly\r\nstate a few points to which attention should be especially directed.\r\n\r\nIn adopting two systems of design of a wall, it is advisable that the\r\nchange of form be gradual and not made abruptly, or cracks may occur\r\nfrom unequal settlement or load upon the foundations, and also when a\r\nconcrete bed is used under a wall a lime concrete layer cannot be firmly\r\njoined to one composed of more solid and unyielding material, such as\r\nPortland cement concrete. Similar walls erected upon different soils are\r\nnot equally strained, as one earth may scarcely change from the effects\r\nof air and water, and another may vary daily according to the weather.\r\n\r\nTo counteract any overturning tendency, a wall should have a large\r\nbearing area under the face portion, all projections and heavy copings\r\nshould be avoided, or anything that increases the load near the face at\r\nthe top. Weight and width of base and considerable depth of foundations\r\nare most important, for well designed walls when placed upon stable\r\nground have been pushed forward simply from an insufficiently deep hold\r\nin the ground; and the load upon the earth must be within its safe\r\nbearing power. A wall should be designed so that its centre of gravity\r\nis as far from the face as practicable, and when it is constructed of\r\nstone or brick it is necessary that the joints be as strong as possible,\r\nand be capable of resisting varying strains. Should lime mortar be used\r\nit is probable it will be partly washed out, and Portland cement mortar\r\nshould always be preferred upon the face, or water may percolate into\r\nthe wall and even pass through it to the earth and cause slips and\r\nsubsidences.\r\n\r\nCounterforts erected upon the outer face of retaining walls are much to\r\nbe preferred to any placed at the back, for support at the face is what\r\nis required: in the latter case there is always a chance of their\r\nbecoming separated from the main wall, although when so located at the\r\nback they are considered to lessen the lateral pressure of the earth by\r\ndividing it, but any reduction caused by friction of the soil against\r\nthe sides may vary so greatly, according to the condition and subsidence\r\nof the earth, that it is prudent to disregard it, and it is well to\r\nremember that the pressure may become intensified or uneven upon the\r\nmain wall by deflection and concentration caused by the counterforts,\r\nthe result being the creation of weak and unduly strained places; it may\r\ntherefore be better to uniformly increase the thickness of the wall.\r\nCounterforts of triangular shape on plan have been adopted in order to\r\nlessen the lateral thrust by directing it to the sides of the triangles,\r\ntheir bases being against the wall. It is doubtful whether the thrust of\r\nthe earth so acts under the usual varying conditions of work. The\r\nnecessity of mooring vessels alongside a dock or quay-wall prevents the\r\nadoption of face counterforts except to a very limited extent; however,\r\nalthough the form of a ship permits of only a slight batter for the\r\nupper half, the lower portion may be inclined for a few feet from the\r\nbottom. As the adoption of a batter on the face increases the area of\r\nthe base of a wall and its frictional surface upon the ground, and tends\r\nto lessen overturning movement and undue strain upon the face, a dock,\r\nquay, or retaining wall having a batter is to be preferred to one with a\r\nvertical face; in fact, it acts as a triangular front counterfort, with\r\nthe great advantage of being an inherent part of a wall.\r\n\r\nIn foundations of a sandy or silty character, a dock or quay-wall having\r\nwells in the cross section to within a few feet of its base filled with\r\nrammed light dry material, the width of the bottom nearly approaching\r\nthat of the depth of water, has been adopted in preference to a solid\r\nwall of less thickness, as affording a wider base, greater resistance to\r\noverturning, and a reduction of the weight upon the foundations.\r\n\r\nA slip of the earth backing is frequently caused from insufficient\r\ndrainage and a consequent accumulation of water behind a wall, producing\r\nsuch pressure that the friction of the weight of the wall upon the\r\nfoundations is impaired and the support in front insufficient to resist\r\na forward movement, therefore the back drainage should receive due\r\nattention. When a dock-wall has been thrust forward by the earth it may\r\nbe a serious movement, likely to increase and culminate in the\r\ndestruction of the wall, or be merely a slight lateral settlement. Such\r\nslips are usually of considerable length, and have an apex where the\r\ngreatest forward motion has occurred. The chief remedies consist in\r\nsecuring the foundations, supporting the face, lightening or removing\r\nthe pressure of the backing, draining the backwaters and preventing\r\ntheir reaching the wall. Provided a wall is intact and not damaged, but\r\nsolidly and horizontally pushed forward, it need not be taken down, but\r\nif vertical subsidence has taken place, or a settlement, at the face\r\nonly, it is generally of serious importance, and it may be necessary to\r\nremove and replace it.\r\n\r\nWhen a wall bulges slightly from the pressure of the earth at the back\r\nand then ceases to move, the ground behind may have become in a state of\r\npermanent equilibrium, and the lateral thrust, which before movement was\r\ntoo great, may be so reduced that in the altered position it may remain\r\nstable, provided the void is filled with light porous backing, and the\r\ndrainage of the earth receives due attention. Counterforts of piles\r\nreaching to the level of the ground in front of the face have been\r\nadopted to arrest and prevent a forward movement, but when the ground is\r\nmuch disturbed and in a loose state, it is unadvisable to drive piles\r\nbecause of vibration which may induce further motion. Instead of timber\r\npile counterforts, trenches might be cut at intervals along the toe and\r\nbe filled with quick-setting cement concrete, the filling to follow the\r\nexcavation as closely as possible, and no unsupported earth to be\r\nallowed to remain.\r\n\r\nAs improper backing often induces a slip and subsidence of the earth and\r\nthe failure of a wall, it is of importance that it should be carefully\r\nexecuted, for many well-designed walls have failed or bulged from being\r\nbadly and hurriedly backed with unsuitable and soft retentive material\r\nin a deteriorated condition, the result being movement of the earth.\r\nCare should be taken that the material of which the backing is composed\r\nwill always maintain the slope of repose upon which the calculations\r\nhave been based that determined the dimensions of the wall; therefore,\r\nit should always have an angle of repose which is not much affected by\r\nmoisture. It is important to remember that according to the nature of\r\nthe backing so will be the pressure upon a wall, depending principally\r\nupon the coefficient of friction of the earth upon similar earth, its\r\ncohesion, its friction upon the surface of the back of a wall, the\r\ninclination of the layers, the general character of the soil and the\r\neffect of moisture upon it; and no vegetable, decayed, or “made” earth\r\nshould be used for such a purpose, nor material which gives a varying\r\nthrust according to the state of dampness or dryness, and the lightest\r\ndry, firm, and stable earth should be preferred. When rubble backing is\r\nadopted and is carefully packed, the lateral thrust may be greatly\r\nreduced, as in some degree, instead of backing a dry wall may be\r\nconsidered to have been built at the back of the face wall. Clean ashes\r\nare an excellent material for filling damp places in a wall, because\r\nthey not only absorb moisture, but are light, and stand permanently at a\r\nslope of about 1 to 1 TO 1¼ to 1, but they can seldom be obtained in\r\nsufficient quantity to be used in considerable masses; also broken\r\nbricks and burnt ballast, although heavier, make good backing.\r\n\r\nEarth that is much affected by air or water, or that expands, contracts,\r\nor fissures, such as clay, is not good for filling, and dry masonry\r\nretaining walls should not be hacked with earth but with rubble, or in\r\ncountries with a heavy rainfall the wall will most probably be forced\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to have plenty of weep-holes in a wall so as to\r\nobviate any accumulation of water, and it is well if the back has a\r\nrough face in order to increase friction and prevent cavities in the\r\nbacking down which water may percolate. During construction a few\r\nweep-holes in a dock or quay-wall should always be provided, until the\r\nwater is to be let in to a dock, when it is best to fill them with\r\nstrong Portland cement concrete as water would proceed along them from\r\nthe face and accumulate at the back of a wall; the permanent drainage\r\nbeing affected by other means.\r\n\r\nIn pulling down walls that have been built with offsets at the back it\r\nwill usually be noticed that the filling does not rest upon them, but\r\nthat hollows occur as the earth subsides; for this reason, a straight\r\nbatter at the back is to be preferred. No support from the weight of the\r\nearth, which is supposed to be upon them, should be relied upon,\r\nalthough it may temporarily exist.\r\n\r\nThe filling should be commenced at the wall, and the layers be so\r\ndeposited that their slope approximates to that of being at right angles\r\nto the surface of the slope of the ground rather than parallel to it.\r\nWhen thought desirable and the natural ground is solid, it can be\r\nbenched, and the backing be damped and rammed.\r\n\r\nThe backing of a wall may consist not only of an inverted triangular\r\npiece of earth, but extend for some distance to the rear, and may have a\r\ntop surface at a considerable height above it; the wall will then have\r\nto sustain a severe thrust. The angle of repose of the earth should be\r\nascertained and the filling be thoroughly drained, or it may be\r\ndisintegrated by moisture, the whole mass gradually become unstable, and\r\nfinally push the wall forward with great force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  NOTES UPON SLIPS OF EARTH, SUBSIDENCES AND MOVEMENT IN FOUNDATIONS\r\n    CAUSED BY “BOILS” OR AN UPWARD RUSH OF WATER IN LOOSE\r\n    EARTHS.—CONSIDERATION OF SOME PRECAUTIONARY AND REMEDIAL OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to “boils” in sandy soils and the general drainage of the\r\nsite of dockworks, operations should be commenced as long as possible\r\nbefore the works of construction, so as to lessen the probability of the\r\noccurrence of slips, subsidences, and movement of earthwork. In order to\r\nreduce infiltration, it is well to make a trench round the area of any\r\nground that has to be excavated, which may embrace the whole site. A\r\nsystem of drains and conduits should be established within it, and at\r\nthe lowest level a sump at a convenient position, and to a depth a few\r\nfeet below that of the work; it can then be made the chief pumping\r\nstation of the dock; but all drawing away or flow of the earth must be\r\nprevented: and to obviate erosion of the drains, they may require to be\r\nrough lined with an impervious covering such as clay. The sump should\r\nconsist of an iron cylinder with proper provision against a run of soil.\r\nIn all loose earths the pumping station should be some distance from\r\nbuildings or roads so as to avoid any settlement.\r\n\r\nWhen a choice of sites exists and the position of a dock is not\r\nabsolutely fixed, it may be possible to have the foundations of the\r\nwhole work in one kind of earth; if otherwise, one portion may be stable\r\nand another unstable, always treacherous, and liable to slip and\r\nsubside. In any case settlement is not likely to be equal, and therefore\r\na foundation which is well able to sustain an evenly distributed load\r\nmay yield from unequal strain and excess of lateral thrust. Consequent\r\nupon the situation of docks, the superficial beds upon which they have\r\nto be erected frequently vary in stability and reliability; and the\r\nlocation being altered in any direction may result most seriously; the\r\nearth upon one side of a comparatively narrow river being stable in\r\ncharacter and on the opposite bank most treacherous. Difficulties often\r\narise in foundations, especially in sandy soils, from making borings and\r\ntrial pits too near the important parts of the work; they should be made\r\nas reasonably far away as is convenient. In boring, a sand flow may\r\noccur, when it may be necessary to fill the bore-hole and sustain the\r\nsoil by a covering, or by consolidating the sand by means of Portland\r\ncement, and then, perhaps, reliable operations may be continued. Borings\r\nshould be considered as unreliable if merely superficial; in any case of\r\nimportance they should only be trusted for the place where they are\r\nmade, and not as indicating the nature or condition of the soil over a\r\nconsiderable area. When pits cannot be sunk, it is desirable that in a\r\nsuspectedly treacherous site the bore-holes should be at every 200 or\r\n300 feet.\r\n\r\nExcavating pits, using test-bars, and driving piles are some of the\r\nmethods of determining the character of foundations, but care should be\r\ntaken to ascertain in boring that boulders, or thin strata of hard\r\ngravel, are not mistaken for solid rock. In sand, mud, or soft clay they\r\ncan be made by means of an iron pipe and the water-jet system.\r\nExperience has proved that boring with an auger is not so reliable as\r\nboring with a tube, such as is used for artesian wells. In the case of\r\naugers, when boulders are encountered, further boring is usually\r\narrested in that place and another bore-hole has to be commenced. Trial\r\npits, where practicable, should be preferred to boring, and they should\r\nbe sunk to a depth considerably below the lowest level of the intended\r\nfoundations, and then they may do for sump holes for pumping operations.\r\nIn testing ground by borings, several should be made, as one hole might\r\nencounter a boulder or some hard soil, such as indurated clay, and the\r\nlatter may adhere to the auger and arrest its progress; the specimens\r\nthen brought up, being crushed and pressed together, will appear to be\r\nfirmer than the actual condition of the ground.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly referred to the preliminary drainage, and some methods of\r\nascertaining the nature of the ground, the former to lessen, and the\r\nlatter to aid discovery of the character of any probable upward lushes\r\nof soil: “boils” in foundations are more specifically considered. It may\r\nbe said that they generally proceed from an impervious top stratum being\r\npierced, thereby tapping the water in a pervious bed which may be\r\nimposed upon another impervious layer; for the upper bed being excavated\r\nremoves the weight upon the lower strata and induces a flow of the\r\npreviously confined water.\r\n\r\nThe source of disturbance may be either from surface-water in the top\r\nsoil or from deep underground springs, depending in great measure upon\r\nthe extent of the catchment area and head-water level of the district,\r\nas its quantity and uplifting pressure will be principally governed by\r\nthem. When the soil is in a delicate state of equilibrium it only\r\nrequires a slight deteriorating alteration of the normal condition to\r\ninitiate a movement. The disturbance of the ground may be merely\r\nsuperficial, nevertheless its effect may be sufficient to start a\r\n“boil,” although the chief cause potently exists at some considerable\r\ndepth and distance.\r\n\r\n“Boils” produced by simply surface-water require one system of\r\ntreatment; if from underground waters, another remedy is necessary.\r\nEvery effort should be made to know the reason, trace the origin, and to\r\nascertain the power of the disturbing forces. It may be possible to\r\ndetermine them, although generally it can only be done by deductive\r\nreasoning and logical inference. In any event immediate action is\r\ninvaluable when a “boil” appears. Weighting the ground around a “boil”\r\nwith an impervious mass of clay, and the insertion of a stand-pipe will\r\nindicate the level to which the water will rise, varying according to\r\nthe seasons, and will give an approximate idea of the head supply and\r\npressure; care being taken that the pipe does not become obstructed and\r\nthat the water has a free flow. It may also be ascertained by the\r\ninsertion of pipe-rods to different depths, and by noticing the effects,\r\nsuch as the rapidity, the quantity and the character of the discharge.\r\nThere may be an appreciable difference in the height to which the water\r\nrises in various stand-pipes; if so, its flow is obstructed or the\r\nsource is not identical. An examination of the colour and nature of the\r\nsuspended matter in the water and a comparison of it with the strata may\r\nshow its source, but it is not always reliable unless the same colour is\r\nmaintained for the lowest depths.\r\n\r\nA perusal of Chapter II. will indicate some situations in which “boils”\r\nmay be expected. The conditions under which they may appear are so\r\nnumerous that it may be stated they generally occur in any situation\r\nwhen a layer of loose soil has a superimposed bed of more or less\r\nimpervious boil upon it which is perforated by the excavation for a dock\r\nor other work; and especially should a water-bearing stratum, such as\r\nchalk, underlie a sand stratum; also when a water-bearing stratum is\r\nsuperimposed upon sand which lies upon an impervious bed such as clay,\r\nas water will percolate to the sand; and when sand overlies a\r\nwater-charged stratum; or at the outcrop of chalk hills near the site;\r\nor where sand is below an impervious layer of clay and the latter is\r\ntapped. The “boils,” of course, become more serious as the head of water\r\nincreases, and also when the strata dip towards the site.\r\n\r\nAn impervious bed may be of such thickness, that when the lowest\r\nfoundation is excavated there may be no fear of water from any\r\nunderground source being forced up through it; however, unless the\r\nthickness of the upper layer is known to be nearly uniform over the site\r\nof a dock, which is seldom the case, the water pressure, aided by the\r\nweight of the structure, may separate or loosen the soil at a weak\r\nplace, and then a “boil” will be the result. The thickness of the crust\r\nrequired, which may be anything from about 15 feet upward, may be\r\napproximately ascertained by weighting the earth considerably above the\r\nload it will permanently have to sustain, and by watching the subsidence\r\nand general effect. Great care should be taken not to perforate the firm\r\nstratum, as danger will at once ensue should loose soil, such as sand,\r\nbe tapped, for cavities will then be produced causing subsidence,\r\nprobable fracture of the firm stratum, “boils,” and slips of serious\r\nextent. When a heavy structure has to be built upon such a soil, and it\r\nis impossible because of the expense to place the foundations except\r\nupon this superficial bed, experiments in the direction indicated should\r\nalways be made, and any other means of proof that circumstances may\r\nallow other than by perforation of the stratum: in any case every effort\r\nshould be made to reliably ascertain that the firm stratum is of uniform\r\ndepth and character.\r\n\r\nThe discharge channel of any underground waters likely to disturb the\r\nfoundations should be discovered, and when there are adjacent hills, by\r\ntracing their dampest part the probable direction of the surface flow\r\nmay become known. Inquiry should be made to find out whether any borings\r\nhave been made over the site in order to determine if the “boils” have\r\nbeen artificially created or are natural blow-wells, in which the water\r\nrises over the top and can, perhaps, be led away by gravitation. It is\r\nadvisable to fill every bore-hole with Portland cement mortar before any\r\nexcavation is commenced, or they will burst out when the surrounding\r\nground is disturbed. Bags containing shot have been used to help to\r\nclose a hole, but a preferable method is to insert a pipe down the bore,\r\nit having been previously cleared of all dirt; and to fill it with neat\r\nPortland cement mortar, the tube being raised as the hole is filled.\r\nSuch a method, although successful with small holes, is useless in the\r\ncase of “blows” of the ordinary size. A permanent shaft or cylinder is\r\nthen necessary.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the treatment of “boils” in foundations, when in the\r\npossession of the information hereinbefore named it may indicate a\r\nremedy either for “boils” in which the cause of disturbance is at a\r\nconsiderable depth and the head and fall of water moderately large, or\r\nwhen the agitation is merely superficial, which may result from the\r\nrange of the tidal waters or the want of surface drainage.\r\n\r\nWhen a “boil” is of the first order, it is useless attempting to simply\r\nstop it by force and prevent the issue of water, as such a method of\r\nprocedure would result in merely diverting the disturbance, and in\r\naddition leave a weak place in the foundations; however, if many “boils”\r\nappear, and the disintegrating agency of the water is removed either by\r\nconducting or diverting the flow from the site, they can then be filled,\r\nand it should be simultaneously effected, or any mere exudation in the\r\nwhole of the “boils” may become increased in one or two to a flow\r\nsufficient to cause a slip or instability, and any concentration of the\r\ndischarge may produce movement of the ground. Small springs or “boils”\r\nhave been sufficiently arrested by depositing clay over them, excavating\r\nit, and putting in the foundations very promptly and before the “boil”\r\nburst out again; such treatment, however, may lead to the backing of a\r\nwall becoming saturated and the water being dammed up: on the other\r\nhand, the “boil” may be sealed and the water flow away in the original\r\nunderground channels; also when a “boil” is tapped it may induce an\r\nincreased flow of the underground waters, for they will find the course\r\nof least resistance; and should they reach a fine sand stratum will\r\nfilter through and set it in motion, provided the head is sufficient to\r\novercome friction; and the support rendered to any overlying stratum\r\nwill therefore be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn the event of there being only one “boil,” but that of important\r\nextent, perhaps the best way to proceed is to place clay upon the\r\nsurface for a few feet around it, the weight of which should not be less\r\nthan the normal pressure of the earth removed by excavation, _vide_\r\nChapter V.: and by the insertion of a cylinder, with a properly designed\r\nbottom, to prevent the issue of soil to a level some feet below the\r\nlowest intended excavation upon the site, or to the depth at which the\r\ngreatest flow of water is obtained; care being taken that no run of sand\r\nor soil is allowed and that the water is not charged with earth, either\r\nby a thick gravel layer until the sand ceases to pass through it, or by\r\nother means, remembering that the motive power of running sand is that\r\nof the pressure of water. The flow should be gently led away, if\r\nnecessary, to a sump, and discharged by pumping, thus draining the\r\nworks. The sump should always be lined, not only to prevent any flow\r\nupon or into the surface causing saturation, but so as to control and\r\nregulate the water some feet below the lowest level of the foundations,\r\nthe great point being to draw downwards the water from the earth and\r\nthen to carry it away. An iron or wooden cylinder sump is to be\r\npreferred to one constructed of sheet piles or timber-lined, as the soil\r\nmay be so loose that any shaking or vibration should not be allowed, and\r\na close joint is not easy to attain in timber pile work. It is well to\r\ndeposit some clay puddle for a little distance round the sump after\r\nsinking it in order to weight the soil and steady the cylinder. When a\r\ndischarging outlet has been made it should be maintained in perfect\r\ncondition, or a slip or subsidence may occur from leakage or diversion\r\nof the flow. It may also happen that no discharge is necessary, for if\r\nthe “boil” is only, as it were, of local extent and caused by a weak\r\nvein in otherwise stable soil, the water may rise to the head level and\r\nthere remain; the equilibrium being restored which had been destroyed by\r\nreason of the upper strata of an impervious character being excavated.\r\nThe removal of the normal pressure upon the loose soil to some extent,\r\nliberates the water, and the head ceasing to be balanced by it, the\r\nearth cannot do otherwise than allow water to upraise it. A calculation\r\nof the weight of the earth removed may give an indication within which\r\nwill be the probable head level of the supply, and usually it is much\r\nbelow a head of water that would equal the normal pressure of the soil.\r\nSupposing the weight of the earth to be twice that of water, when 10\r\nfeet of soil is excavated before a “boil” began, its removal would\r\napproximately be equivalent to a 20 feet head of water.\r\n\r\nThe great point is to confine a “boil” within a certain space, and there\r\nto treat it and so prevent the appearance of others and interruption to\r\nthe prosecution of the works. All agitation of the surface of sand,\r\nespecially when a “boil” appears, must be prevented, as inducing a\r\ndisturbed and more porous condition.\r\n\r\nWhen the seat of a “boil” must be built over, the well system of\r\nfoundations can be used as not only affording reliable support, but also\r\npreventing a “boil” extending, and allowing the flow of water to be\r\ndischarged, care being taken that complete connection is made with a\r\nwall constructed upon any other principle. If “boils” appear over a\r\nconsiderable area, it is evident that the disturbance is general, and\r\nmay either be because the site or the foundations of the works are below\r\nthe level at which water is usually found in the district, or be\r\nproduced by the rise and fall of tidal waters. When by the former,\r\ndrains are required a few feet below the general water-bearing level,\r\nand they should intercept the percolation of the land waters and conduct\r\nthem from the site of the works, or so gently localize them that they\r\ncan be treated as before described. The land waters are the most\r\ntroublesome because their volume, time of appearance, and duration of\r\nflow will vary, whereas the range of the tidal waters is known, and\r\ntherefore the effects may be ascertained with some approach to accuracy.\r\n\r\nIt may be impossible to erect walls in very loose soils without\r\nencircling the site with sheet piles to prevent a run of sand, to lessen\r\n“blows” and to reduce the disturbance, as placing them upon an\r\nimpervious stratum maybe prohibitory because of the expense: but the\r\nadoption of the well system of foundations down to a firm stratum, or at\r\na sufficient depth to be stable, and the building walls thereon may\r\ncause the temporary pile support to be unnecessary and prevent a slip or\r\nsubsidence. Quick erection and the least exposure or disturbance of\r\nearth are essentials in such cases.\r\n\r\nBy the use of Portland cement concrete, foundations can now be cheaply\r\nobtained with the ground in a wet condition, which in the days when it\r\nwas considered only suitable for secondary works, would have required\r\nthe employment of expensive methods of construction. It may be unwise to\r\narrest the upward flow of the tidal waters in loose soil except by\r\nintercepting, lessening, or preventing it by shore protection, for the\r\nupward pressure of the head of water may “blow” up the earth and cause\r\ndisturbance; on the other hand, should the “boils” be merely superficial\r\nand the head very little, a thick watertight covering of Portland cement\r\nconcrete, when accompanied by the necessary drainage operations, may\r\nsuffice; the surface water blows being covered, and the pressure of the\r\nwater being overbalanced by the superimposed weight.\r\n\r\nAll works to prevent “boils” or to drain waters from the site should, if\r\npossible, be executed prior to the excavation, as the effect of draining\r\ncan then be observed and whether any “boils” arise from land waters or\r\nfrom a tidal flow, and the earth will have had some time in which to\r\nsubside and become consolidated. A month’s test will afford some\r\ncriterion in a variable climate and when changes of weather are\r\nfrequent; but should a long period of drought prevail it may be no\r\nindication of the state in which the earth would be in a wet season, or\r\nunder ordinary meteorological influences; and further, the land waters\r\nmay take a considerable time in flowing to the shore, depending upon the\r\ncatchment area, character of the soil, position of the beds, whether the\r\ndistrict is drained or not, and many other local conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen the soil is firm clay, the locality of any leakage or water seam in\r\nit will usually be indicated by surface exudation over the water-charged\r\nvein; also in nearly all compact earth, particularly if of a clayey or\r\nloamy nature, and therefore the seat of disturbance may not have to be\r\ndiscovered as in looser or sandy soils.\r\n\r\nShould a water-bearing fissure occur in rock and it be necessary to stop\r\nit, there being no danger of diverting the flow to another place upon\r\nthe site of the works, it can be done by means of neat Portland cement\r\nmortar pressed down and kept in place by timber strips, weights or other\r\nmeans until it has set; the face of the fissure should be made as clean\r\nas possible, and the water-bearing seam be filled and weighted directly\r\na leak appears, or the flow may become much increased and accelerated\r\nand a current of water be induced which may become of serious extent.\r\n\r\nTo avoid slips and movement of the ground when it is necessary that a\r\nwater-charged bed of sand be excavated to enable a structure to be built\r\nupon a firm impervious stratum below it, sheet piles can be used or\r\ncorrugated iron sheets, strutted at intervals, so as to prevent a run\r\nand slip of sand; and the space between them can be excavated, a\r\nPortland cement concrete foundation being inserted upon the firm soil,\r\nthe wall being erected in lengths, and the piles or case being\r\npractically three-sided so as to leave no unsupported surface of sand,\r\ncare being taken to prevent any run between the front and the back of\r\nthe last built length of wall and the earth, so that each length is\r\nerected in a contained area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A.\r\n\r\n Absorption, broken
