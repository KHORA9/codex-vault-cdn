Schlebecker is curator in charge, Division of\r\nAgriculture and Mining, Museum of History and Technology, Smithsonian\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe art and science of agriculture embrace most intentional human\r\nefforts to control biological activity so as to produce plants and\r\nanimals of the sort wanted, when wanted. Rubber plantations, cattle\r\nranches, vegetable gardens, dairy farms, tree farms, and a host of\r\nsimilar enterprises all represent human efforts to compel nature to\r\nserve man. Those who undertake agriculture have had, from time\r\nimmemorial, a variety of names, not all of them complimentary. The\r\npeople involved in attempted biological control have been called\r\nfarmers, planters, ranchers, and peasants. Farmers carry on a\r\ncomplicated business in which they use a variety of tools, implements,\r\nand machines. They also employ land, chemicals, water, plants, and\r\nanimals. Their business, however, focuses on living things. No matter\r\nhow crude their attempts, or how uncertain their successes, those who\r\ntry to grow living things rank as agriculturalists.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of course, the definition excludes brewers, distillers,\r\nbiological supply houses, and others, such as zoo curators, who manage\r\nliving things. Agriculture takes place on a piece of land widely and\r\ncommonly known as a farm.]\r\n\r\nFor the most part, a museum cannot show the essential biological aspects\r\nof agriculture. Agricultural production involves the farmer in the\r\ncourse of nature in its seasons, and in the peculiar laws of living\r\nthings. In these respects, agriculture stands rather apart from\r\ntransportation, manufacturing, and artistic industries where the tools,\r\nmachines, and raw materials remain fairly inert as men work on them.\r\nMachines move but do not live, and therein lies the major difference\r\nbetween agriculture and the other arts. Farmers deal with plants and\r\nanimals but the museum can show only the things a farmer uses as he\r\naccommodates to and regulates nature. Some of the objects, in\r\nthemselves, give a fair idea of how the farmer used them. Most people,\r\nafter all, know about edged blades and digging tools. Nearly anyone can\r\ngrasp what a man might do with a scythe or a plow. Even the working of a\r\nmodern reaper needs only a little explanation. But museums cannot well\r\nshow cross-breeding of plants and animals. Museums seldom can show the\r\nresults of that cross-breeding. Bags of fertilizer can be put on\r\ndisplay, as can vials of penicillin, and jars of herbicide. Although\r\nsome may find these interesting, such items show little in and of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the things that cannot be shown in any easily\r\nintelligible way surpass in importance the items that can be shown. The\r\nsheep shears, which anyone can understand, represent less to the farmer\r\nthan do the sheep. Sheep shears, no matter how sophisticated and no\r\nmatter how necessary, do not explain sheep husbandry. The shears tell\r\nlittle about the wool industry, and nothing much about sheep breeds. And\r\nso on through the list of agricultural enterprises.\r\n\r\nMuseums must collect and exhibit the tools, implements, and machines\r\nwhich farmers use in their business. These items, however, seldom make\r\nup the core of real agricultural activity. The catalog here presented\r\nshows something of the range of items that farmers use and that can be\r\npreserved and shown. The variety nearly equals the volume. Most museums\r\ntry to avoid duplication. Even so, few museums manage to collect a\r\ncontinuous series of things showing any one line of development. The\r\ndiscontinuity of farm objects on hand virtually rules out the telling of\r\na coherent and complete history of agriculture. Nevertheless, the museum\r\ncan show something about the major technological developments in\r\nagriculture. The evolution of the plow, the reaper, or the tractor can\r\nbe suggested even if not fully illustrated. Hitting the highlights has\r\nto suffice.\r\n\r\nThe full history of technological change also involves several social\r\nand economic conditions.\r\n\r\nFirst, changes in implements, tools, and methods result from the\r\naccumulation of knowledge. Device builds upon device: first came the\r\nwheel, and then, much later, the tractor.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the potential user of the device must feel a need for it. The\r\nnew method or device not only must save him work but must clearly\r\nincrease his well-being. If any device or change merely increases the\r\nwealth of someone else (a tax collector or a landlord for example), the\r\nfarmer seldom will adopt the new technology.\r\n\r\nThirdly, since, at first, the new technology almost invariably costs\r\nmore than the old, the user must have or be able to get the capital to\r\nbuy and use the newer devices and methods.\r\n\r\nOf these conditions for technological change, only the cumulative nature\r\nof the knowledge can be shown by the objects. Even here, however,\r\nmissing objects make it possible to present only the most obvious\r\nchanges, and then not all of them. Still, seeing the things once\r\nused--no matter how crude or how few--can sometimes help us understand\r\nthe way changes took place. Also, this knowledge sometimes can help us\r\nguess how other changes will take place:\r\n\r\n     The sequence of inventions also depends upon the changing needs of\r\n     a society. Needs and circumstances vary more than do degrees of\r\n     talent. Thus when need and knowledge merge, inventors quickly\r\n     appear. Indeed, several men in several places are likely to work on\r\n     the same problems at the same time, and they often solve it in\r\n     almost identical fashion. Nearly simultaneous inventions or\r\n     discoveries occur with astonishing frequency in the history of\r\n     technology.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"The Combine Made in Stockton,\" Pacific Historian, no. 10\r\n(Autumn, 1966), p. 14.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Use of Farm Machinery in America\r\n\r\nThe part of America that was destined to become the United States\r\nstarted its history at the very time when the parent European\r\ncivilization began to make major breakthroughs in science and\r\ntechnology. Thus, Americans became the automatic beneficiaries of the\r\nachievements of others. Because of peculiar opportunities and needs,\r\nAmericans could and did push on to unique achievements. Nowhere,\r\nhowever, did this building on the past appear as early, or as\r\nimpressively, as in the agricultural sector of the economy. American\r\ninventors of farm implements made important strides earlier than those\r\nin any other field. In turn, American farmers made more and better use\r\nof discoveries and inventions.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1650s onward Europeans expanded their activities in all fields\r\nand in all directions. By that time Europeans had already discovered the\r\nNew World, and had seized or bullied most of the Old. European trade and\r\nindustry increased, and as these grew so also did population and\r\nurbanization. People multiplied, and an increasingly greater proportion\r\nof them began to live in towns and cities. Simultaneously, the Europeans\r\nincreased in wealth; indeed, most of their activities created more\r\nwealth. The ever-increasing number of people called for more food, and\r\nfor changes in European farming. The Europeans' growing wealth also\r\nallowed them to buy luxury items from around the world: silk and spice\r\nand everything nice. The goods came not only from the Far East and\r\nAfrica but also from the New World. When Europeans began to settle\r\nAmerica, they almost at once had the advantages of a large and growing\r\nmetropolitan market in western Europe. This market provided\r\nopportunities for wealth, but only if the American farmers developed\r\nappropriate commodities and produced them at reasonable prices.\r\n\r\nThe English, Dutch, Swedes, French, and Spanish settled in North America\r\nat trading and exploring stations. So located, they could direct the\r\nflow of products to Europe. The English chiefly sought rare products\r\nsuch as gold and spices, and they sent back furs. The Dutch concentrated\r\non furs. All European pioneers, however, had to feed themselves. This\r\ntook a bit of doing, which at first involved a merging of European\r\ntechnology with Indian crops and methods. Later, the settlers adapted\r\nEuropean crops and animals. In spite of starving times in almost every\r\ncolony from Virginia to New England, the new Americans at least mastered\r\nthe art of feeding themselves.\r\n\r\nEuropean technology used animals for draft and employed plows, harrows,\r\nand similar implements. This technology fit European crops better than\r\nit fit American crops. Thus, European implements and draft animals did\r\nnot appear until comparatively late. As long as they depended chiefly on\r\nIndian crops, Europeans simply substituted iron hoes for stone hoes, and\r\niron axes for stone axes. But methods such as girdling, slash and burn,\r\nand the rest, came almost directly from Indian technology. The Pilgrims\r\nof Plymouth Plantation went 12 years without a plow; Virginians went\r\nalmost as long. The hoe of corn culture served well enough to keep men\r\nalive. Hunting and fishing, of course, supplemented the food supply, as\r\nit did for the Indians.\r\n\r\nFrom north to south the story was largely the same in the 17th century.\r\nEverywhere the new Americans pursued a subsistence agriculture which\r\nsupported some other major economic activity. Pennsylvania developed\r\npossibly the most flourishing subsistence farming. The commercial\r\nproduction of tobacco, an American crop with American methods and uses,\r\nbegan early in Virginia and Maryland. This specialty developed\r\ncommercially almost exclusively in the upper South. Farmers and planters\r\nof the lower South had hesitantly begun rice culture, but as the 17th\r\ncentury ended men in the Carolinas still found hides and furs the most\r\nrewarding commodities. Meanwhile, rapid changes took place in the\r\nEuropean metropolitan centers, and in the West Indian islands. The\r\ngrowth of population in both places created consumers for more and\r\ncheaper food. Markets for American foods definitely began to increase as\r\nthe 18th century got under way.\r\n\r\nEuropeans, of course, primarily wanted European foods rather than exotic\r\nIndian crops. The foods also had to be comparatively nonperishable and\r\neasily transported. Grains, particularly wheat, and processed meat\r\n(hams, salt pork, and such) especially met European preferences.\r\nCommercial production of these commodities compelled American farmers to\r\nembrace the best European technology insofar as that technology fit the\r\nAmerican scene. The plants, animals, methods, and tools all derived from\r\nEurope. Contrary to a common European view at the time, the immigrants\r\ndid not bring the worst available methods to the New World. Nor did the\r\nAmericans allow any deterioration of stock or plants without good\r\neconomic reasons.\r\n\r\nMost European criticism about American farming centered on things of no\r\nconsequence to American farmers, who were selling in a world market.\r\nTrue, Americans tended toward slovenly cultivation, but niceness of\r\nmethod mattered little if the land yielded an abundant exportable\r\nsurplus. Americans paid less attention than Europeans to fertilizer, but\r\nAmericans at first had less need for it. Livestock, in spite of nearly\r\ncontinual importations from Europe, tended to decline from a European\r\nstandpoint. Still, the animals yielded meat of a quality suitable for\r\nexport. The hardy American animals could survive in spite of casual\r\ncare. Americans had few barns and sheds, but the world market for meat\r\ndid not demand barns, stalls, and fancy feeding. American dairy cows\r\nyielded ridiculously low volumes of milk, butter, and cheese, but dairy\r\nproducts, after all, served only the resident Americans. The corn- and\r\nmast-fed hogs of America provided ham that was equal to any in Europe.\r\nIf the European consumer bought American food, the American farmer\r\nthought it pointless to consider the comfort and emotional well-being of\r\nhis animals.\r\n\r\nNew Englanders tended to concentrate on animals, the middle Atlantic on\r\ngrains, the upper South on tobacco, and the lower South on rice and\r\nindigo. The Revolutionary War disrupted the marketing from the farmer's\r\nview, but the major commercial commodities remained largely unchanged in\r\nthe years immediately after the war. Indigo declined and then\r\ndisappeared as a major export commodity, but cotton almost at once\r\nreplaced it.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century men everywhere made great technological advances. In\r\nAmerica, the advances took place in a sort of reciprocal action with\r\nthree major historical series and events dominating the story: the\r\nwestward movement, urbanization, and industrialization.\r\n\r\nThe greatest westward expansion in American history took place during\r\nthe 19th century. American farmers and stockmen conquered, and almost\r\nentirely settled, a continent. They did this in a single century,\r\n1801-1900. Nothing quite like it had ever happened before. Starting from\r\na thin line of people on the eastern seaboard (with a few incursions\r\nacross the mountains as of 1800), farmers and herders pushed into a\r\nnearly empty land, dispossessed the Indians, and exploited the country.\r\nAnd in course of time the American pioneers wanted and received\r\npolitical organization. California entered the Union in 1850, the Plains\r\nstates mostly in the 1880s, and more states, such as Arizona, New\r\nMexico, and Oklahoma, came into the Union in the 20th century.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a nation that was weak and underdeveloped in 1801,\r\nhad, by 1900, become the world's leading industrial nation. From\r\nvirtually no industry in 1801, America rose to leading industrial power\r\nin 1900, with more railroads and more manufactured goods per capita than\r\nany other nation. Involved in the industrialization, and importantly so,\r\nwas the farm implement and machinery industry. Factories everywhere\r\nsupplied farmers with the sophisticated tools and machines of the new\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nIn these years urbanization also went forward rapidly. Cities of the\r\neast grew fantastically, and even in the interior cities rose from\r\nwilderness outposts to gigantic metropolises. Within one man's lifetime\r\nChicago increased from 350 people in 1830 to 1,099,000 in 1890.\r\nSimultaneously, tremendous developments in transportation kept the\r\nnation and its economy tied together. All of these developments had a\r\nprofound influence on farming and farmers. The rich cities provided ever\r\ngreater markets for the farmers' produce. The transportation system,\r\nrapidly moving farm commodities, made farming profitable in remote\r\nregions far distant from the coast. Farmers also felt the advantages of\r\nthe return flow of goods and services: the mail order catalog, the\r\nindustrially made reapers and threshers, and countless other items. City\r\npeople made a countless range of devices for farmers--from steel plows\r\nto steam engines.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as these events altered the life of the farmer, a burst of\r\nactivity took place in invention and discovery. These activities had a\r\ndelayed but considerable impact on farm methods and technology. The list\r\nof inventions and discoveries could hardly fit in this narrative, but\r\nthis catalog of items reflects fairly well what men accomplished in the\r\n19th century. The changes included such diverse elements as the\r\ninvention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793, the introduction of\r\nMexican Upland cotton in 1805, the discovery of the cause of Texas fever\r\nin cattle in 1889, and the invention of the internal combustion tractor\r\nin 1892. These and many other achievements substantially changed the\r\nfarm enterprise in two major directions: first, advances in technology\r\nallowed farmers to do more in less time; second, discoveries in science\r\nallowed farmers to increase the yield from the land. Farmers got more\r\nfrom each acre, plant, and animal.\r\n\r\nFarmers could use the savings in time brought by better implements and\r\nnew machines to increase the amount of land farmed and the number of\r\nanimals cared for. Presumably, the farmer could also use the saved time\r\nfor greater leisure. In fact, however, they usually used the extra time\r\nfor more work. In the 20th century they often used the saved time for\r\noutside employment. Farmers did this in the 19th century, but not so\r\ncommonly as later. Greater man-hour efficiency gave the farmer more time\r\nto devote to managing his enterprise, to keeping records, and to\r\nstudying his business.\r\n\r\nTechnological efficiency also allowed farmers to use more land and more\r\nanimals. The average size of farms steadily increased across the\r\ncentury. Furthermore, the new machines and the pure-bred livestock cost\r\nmoney which could be most profitable only if the farmer specialized in\r\none, or at most two, types of enterprise. So the greater efficiency\r\ncreated by technology impelled farmers to greater specialization, and\r\nwith specialization came even greater efficiency. Anyone who specializes\r\nwill likely be more efficient because of the mastering of skills. He\r\nwill also have a minimum of other cares to distract him. Of course, for\r\nthe consumers, foreign or domestic, greater farming efficiencies\r\nresulted in abundant food at comparatively low cost.\r\n\r\nPlant and animal importation, improvement of breeds, and discoveries in\r\ngenetics, soil chemistry, the use of fertilizers, and in controlling\r\nplant and animal diseases all helped the living things which form the\r\nbasis of farming yield. Grain farmers not only had to have a wheat which\r\nyielded well but a wheat which resisted the attacks of nature. For\r\nexample, Turkey Red wheat, introduced in 1873 by Mennonites from Russia,\r\nnot only survived drought and yielded well but provided the genetic\r\nelements for newer breeds of wheat. The farmer not only wanted\r\ngood-producing meat cattle, such as the Herefords, but had to control\r\ndiseases and predators which killed the animals. Sick animals do not\r\ngrow properly or, in the case of dairy animals, give much milk. Steady\r\nadvances in disease control for both plants and animals brought fewer\r\nlosses and greater productivity to farmers.\r\n\r\nThe 19th century also brought scientific discoveries in both plant and\r\nanimal nutrition. Fertilizer and soil chemistry made great advances\r\nthrough scientific experiments, at first by farmers and later by\r\ngovernment servants. The first experiment station in the modern era\r\nbegan in Connecticut in 1875, and in 1887 the Congress established such\r\nstations in every state in conjunction with the agricultural Land Grant\r\ncolleges. Scientists at many of the stations also made discoveries in\r\nanimal nutrition. For example, as a result of animal feeding experiments\r\nE. V. McCollum discovered vitamins A and B at the experiment station in\r\nWisconsin in 1915.\r\n\r\nNone of these scientific advances left much residue in the form of\r\nartifacts for museums, but the reality of the changes should not be\r\nobscured by the lack of objects on exhibit. Even so, some of the related\r\nequipment survived. For example, the centrifuge used in the butterfat\r\ntest, discovered in 1890 by Stephen M. Babcock, survived in several\r\nforms. Manure spreaders and tree sprayers, reflective of advances in\r\nbiochemistry, also survived. But these only suggest the more important\r\nbiological control activities for which these machines and tools served\r\nmerely as agents in some way.\r\n\r\nThe 20th century introduced Americans to total war. World Wars I and II\r\ndemanded the total mobilization of all resources by all contenders. In\r\nboth conflicts America became the food reservoir of the Allies. From a\r\ntechnological view, the wars engendered a level of prosperity which both\r\nallowed and encouraged farmers to adopt new methods and devices. The\r\nprincipal technological change in farms was the widespread adoption of\r\nthe internal combustion tractor, first used in 1892. Inventors and\r\nmanufacturers gradually but constantly improved tractors along with the\r\nvarious devices attached to them. Most notable were the corn picker, in\r\n1909, and the cotton picker, in 1942. (Dates are for commercial\r\nproduction in each instance.) Farmers found both machines impracticable\r\nuntil a power source independent of the ground wheel had been developed.\r\nMore than anything else the tractor and its related equipment finally\r\nset men free from the worst drudgery of farming. It also set many\r\nfarmers free from the need to farm at all.\r\n\r\nThe tractor and its equipment accomplished several other remarkable\r\nthings, some obvious and some not so obvious. First, it allowed the\r\nfarmer to get rid of horses and mules, and these animals steadily\r\ndeclined--to such an extent that in the 1960s the census did not even\r\nbother to count them. As a result of this decline, land that farmers had\r\nused to raise feed for animals could grow food for people or fodder for\r\ndairy animals. The amount of land thus released for other needs finally\r\namounted to perhaps 60 million acres, and maybe even more. The change\r\ntook place with increasing rapidity into the 20th century.\r\n\r\nAlso, the tractor sharply reduced labor needs for the major crops of the\r\nUnited States. Even dairying, least susceptible to this sort of\r\nimprovement, felt the impact of the tractor in such things as harvesting\r\nfodder and storing silage by running loaders off the tractor\r\npower-take-off. Since the very founding of agriculture men had\r\ndiscovered only one way to prosper in farming. The farmer had to exploit\r\nsomebody or something. Animals, serfs, slaves, tenants, sharecroppers,\r\nor whatever, including the farmer's family and farm, had at various\r\ntimes been exploited on the farmer's way to success. After the age of\r\nmachinery, however, the farmer tended to exploit the machine instead of\r\nother people or things. People had to leave farming, but in the long run\r\nthey benefited from their removal. The machine had set them free. Chief\r\nof the machines was the gasoline tractor.\r\n\r\nThe influence of science and technology inside a free society may have\r\nbeen even more profound than seems at first glance. The farming of the\r\n20th century, with its chemicals, genetics, machines, and all, required\r\nnot only vast infusions of capital but brains and a considerable\r\nknowledge. Farmers had to be literate at the very least. Elitist\r\nsystems, where one group of people get educated and the others get\r\nworked, could not accomplish much in the modern agricultural world.\r\nFurthermore, notions of two kinds of education--one for the better sort\r\nwho think, and another for the inferiors who do the work--could and did\r\nseriously impede the development of a modern agriculture. The\r\nbackwardness of most of the world, the poverty of the underdeveloped\r\ncountries, stemmed in large part from the impediments created by an\r\nignorant population.\r\n\r\nA country like the United States with its highly technical and\r\nscientific farming could not afford, simply could not endure, limited\r\neducational opportunities for its people. Neither could it long endure\r\nany class structure which placed farmers in an inferior position; for\r\nwhen men feel inferior because of their work they tend to shift to some\r\nother task, leaving the despised work to those who cannot avoid it. A\r\nhighly developed agriculture in the hands of the truly inferior, the\r\nstupid and uneducated, would simply collapse. America, the land of\r\nplenty, had to maintain a high level of education open to all and a\r\nsociety where men reached status, at least partly, by effort and talent.\r\nIn 20th century America the comparative social and economic equality\r\ncontinued, in large part, because the level of technology and science\r\nused in America demanded it. This equality may be one of the most\r\nimportant consequences of the technological and scientific advances in\r\nagriculture during the years 1607-1972.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalog of Agricultural Implements and Machines in the Collection\r\n\r\nIn the following catalog the items are listed numerically in the order\r\nin which the museum received them, with the earliest first and the\r\nlatest last.

English patent number\r\n2324 granted to James Boyce in 1799. Gift of United States Department of\r\nthe Interior.\r\n\r\n17. Model of Newbold Plow, 1797. USNM 46812; 1906. This model of a metal\r\nplow, with wooden beam and handles 14 inches long, represents the plow\r\npatented by Charles Newbold on June 26, 1797, the first American patent\r\nfor a cast-iron plow. Moldboard, share, and landside were cast in one\r\npiece. If the plow broke, it became totally useless. Not until the parts\r\nwere made in separate pieces did the iron plow come into wide use. The\r\ncast iron broke more readily than did the later wrought-iron plows. Gift\r\nof United States Department of the Interior.\r\n\r\n18. Winnowing Basket, about 1750. USNM 54513; 1912. Used by the three\r\nRichardson brothers, the first settlers of Woburn, Massachusetts. The\r\nthreshed grain could be winnowed in two ways. It could be poured slowly\r\nfrom the edge of the basket in a breeze, where the heavier grain fell to\r\nthe ground while the chaff blew away. More commonly, the farmer tossed\r\nthe grain into the air and caught it in the basket, while the chaff blew\r\naway. This rectangular basket measures 50 inches by 30 inches. Gift of\r\nMrs. Clarissa W. Samson, West Medford, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--De Laval centrifugal cream separator of 1879.\r\n(An earlier version of Catalog No. 19.)]\r\n\r\n19.

Gift of Toy\r\nManufacturers of the United States, New York, New York.\r\n\r\n22. Meat Grinding Machine, about 1810. USNM 110326; 1930. Hand made of\r\nwood and iron, with six parts held together by two iron bolts. The\r\ncutting edges are set in the sides of a box parallel to each other and\r\nabout one-quarter inch apart. A shaft, set in the center of the box, is\r\nturned by a crank. The horizontal shaft has iron slugs, graduated from\r\ncoarse to fine, set into the shaft in a helical pattern. The meat enters\r\nthrough the square hole at the top and the iron teeth press it against\r\nthe knife edges; thus, the meat is cut smaller and smaller until it\r\ncomes out a small hole in the bottom of the machine. The device is very\r\nancient in design and could still be found in common use in the United\r\nStates as late as 1860. Gift of R. C. Fairhead, Rushville, Nebraska.\r\n\r\n23. Carey Plow, about 1815. Received from Division of Ethnology in 1931.\r\nA Carey plow with a slot in the beam for a colter. The landside handle\r\npasses through the beam.

The wooden frame, or snead,\r\nsupports the cradle fingers, now missing. Gift of Sydney S. Stabler,\r\nWashington, D. C.\r\n\r\n33. Settling Can Cream Separator, about 1890. USNM 129789; 1934. Cooley\r\nbrand creamer, used for separating milk from cream prior to churning.\r\nThe milk and cream were set in a cool place for several hours while the\r\ncream rose to the top. The farmer drew skim milk off through a spigot at\r\nthe bottom, after which the cream could be drawn off. Used on farms\r\nbefore the hand centrifugal separator came into wide use. By 1890, in\r\nbutter-producing areas, the centrifugal separator had already caused the\r\ndisuse of the Cooley and similar separators. Gift of Sidney S. Stabler,\r\nWashington, D. C.\r\n\r\n34.

Loaned by E. W. Heiss, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Cotton planter, about 1895. (Catalog No. 37.)]\r\n\r\n37. Wooden Drum Cotton Planter, about 1895. USNM 14557; 1937. All wood\r\nexcept for a duckbill furrow opener in front and two duckbill row\r\ncoverers in the rear, both made of metal. The drum of soft wood measures\r\n20 inches in diameter and 13 inches wide. About the center of the drum\r\nis a wooden, metal-rimmed wheel which ran down the furrow, keeping the\r\nseeder on course. Near the wheel, and all around the drum, are 13 evenly\r\nspaced holes through which the cotton seeds fell into the furrow as the\r\ndrum revolved. No counting or tripping mechanism was involved, so the\r\ndevice undoubtedly wasted seed. A mule or a horse pulled the planter and\r\nthe farmer walked behind it. James Nelson of Greenwood, South Carolina,\r\nmade this planter about 1895. Gift of Ruben F. Vaughn, Honea Path, South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n38. Cast-Iron Plow, 1854. USNM 150396; 1938.

Plows of this\r\ntype, made chiefly between 1826 and 1850, involved interchangeable\r\nparts. The first patent precedes that of Jethro Wood by seven months,\r\nbut the principle of interchangeable parts had been worked out and\r\npatented as early as 1813. Gift of Leander McCormick-Goodhart, Silver\r\nSpring, Md.\r\n\r\n39. Mehring's Milking Machine, 1884. USNM 148530; 1938. Original working\r\nmodel of a hand-powered milking machine built by William M. Mehring in\r\n1884. Mehring subsequently improved and patented the machine in 1892.\r\nThe improved machine did not work well because it created continuous\r\nsuction for the length of the stroke. The successful application of\r\nintermittent suction, necessary so as not to injure the cow, was worked\r\nout in Scotland in 1902. Gift of Mrs. Bessie D. Mehring, Keymar,\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\n40. Hand-Powered Milking Machine, 1892. USNM 148530; 1938. Practical\r\nhand-pump milking machine designed and built in 1892 by William M.\r\nMehring, who was granted patent 488282 on December 28, 1892. This\r\nmilker, which injured cows when used rapidly, represents an effort to\r\nsolve the problem of machine milking, although the use of human power\r\nalso limited its usefulness. Gift of Mrs. Bessie D. Mehring, Keymar,\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\n41. Ox Yoke, 1838. USNM 148675; 1938. Edward Scoville (1813-1887) used\r\nthis ox yoke when driving an ox cart from Trumbull County, Ohio, to De\r\nKalb County, Indiana, in 1838. Until well after the Civil War, oxen\r\npulled most of the wagons going west, and this yoke is typical of all\r\nused in the westward migration, in the North as well as in the South.\r\nGift of Reign Scoville, Poplar Bluff, Missouri.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--John Deere plow, one of the three plows made\r\nby Deere in 1838.

Joseph Brierton bought it and used it on his farm,\r\nand the Deere Company obtained it in 1901. It is one of three plows made\r\nby John Deere in 1838, and presumably it is identical to his first steel\r\nshare plow, made in 1837 at Grand Detour. Called the singing plow, it\r\nproved especially effective in prairie country after the sod had been\r\nbroken because the earth did not adhere to the share and moldboard. The\r\nimplement could also be used as a breaking plow. Gift of Deere and\r\nCompany, Moline, Illinois.\r\n\r\n43. Model of Sulky Plow, 1899. USNM 156653; 1940. Working model of the\r\nHy-Lift sulky plow invented by Niels O. Starks of Madison, Wisconsin,\r\nand made by the Fuller and Johnson Company around 1900.

This plow resembles the\r\nOld Colony Strong Plow (No. 48) but it is not as large and the moldboard\r\nis covered with uniform, narrow iron straps. Farmers used this plow for\r\ncross-plowing after initial breaking by the Strong Plow and for\r\ncultivating. It probably was drawn by oxen. John Foster, a corporal in\r\nthe Revolutionary Army, had this implement made at Ipswich,\r\nMassachusetts, in 1783. Gift of United States Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n50. Tavenner Plow, between 1810 and 1860. USNM 161555; 1941. The\r\nTavenner plow has a cast-iron moldboard and a wrought-iron share and\r\ncolter.

USNM 173353; 1946. A machine\r\nused in determining the amount of butterfat in milk or cream. The\r\nVermont Farm Machine Company of Bellows Falls, Vermont, made the\r\ncentrifuge, which mixed sulphuric acid with the milk in order to\r\nproduce a reading of the amount of butterfat tested. The Brighton Farm\r\nat Patuxent River, Montgomery County, Maryland, used this machine around\r\n1895. Stephen M. Babcock developed this tester in 1890 and released it\r\nto the public, without patent, in 1891. The device had far-reaching\r\neffects in the dairy industry, because for the first time it allowed\r\naccurate payment to farmers for the actual amount of butterfat in their\r\nmilk; also, it allowed farmers to test their cows to discover which ones\r\nproduced the most butterfat. Gift of Sidney S. Stabler, Hyattsville,\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\n69. Buggy Rake, 1840. USNM 175393; 1947. The buggy rake harvested grain\r\nafter it had been cut with a cradle. The rake has handles and a wheel,\r\nlike a wheelbarrow, with long wooden tines in front to scoop up the\r\ngrain. When the binder stepped on a bar at the back of the buggy the\r\ntines would move up and allow the grain to slide back against the\r\nuprights in a convenient position for binding. Although it undoubtedly\r\nreduced the physical labor of binding, this rake would not have been\r\nvery efficient and would have allowed the reaper to get far ahead of\r\nthe binder. Gift of F. B. Day, Owosso, Michigan.\r\n\r\n70. Model of Plow, about 1885. USNM 179841; 1949. The model has a share,\r\nstandard, and moldboard of metal with a gauge wheel on the beam.

Cedar Sap Spouts, about 1800. USNM 194893; 1952. Sap spouts for\r\nmaple tree tapping, about 15 inches long and made of cedar. The maple\r\nsyrup and sugar industry provided some income for frontier farms, as\r\nwell as providing sugar for domestic use. Although maple syrup often\r\nsold at high prices, the industry never achieved major importance even\r\nin the localities where it flourished. These spouts are of the sort used\r\nin the pioneer period in New York. (See also Nos. 83, 85-87.) Gift of\r\nFrank E. Olmstead, Potsdam, New York.\r\n\r\n85. Iron Sap Spout, possibly late 19th century. USNM 194893; 1952. A\r\ncast-iron maple sap spout, about 3 inches long, used for gathering the\r\nsap into buckets.

USNM 213356; 1958. A rake for\r\npiling hay that would be carried from the field or put into a mow. This\r\nsort of implement was used as early as 1820. The farmer walked behind\r\nthe horse-drawn rake and raised the handle when the rake was full; this\r\ncaused the double set of teeth to revolve, releasing the hay in a pile\r\nand putting the second set of teeth into position to rake more hay. The\r\nolder method involved using small hand rakes and required considerable\r\ntime and effort in a very disagreeable task. Gift of New York Historical\r\nAssociation, Cooperstown, New York.\r\n\r\n137. Victor Mowing Machine, 1880. USNM 213356; 1958. A one-horse,\r\nfront-cut mowing machine similar to the Buckeye mower. The cutter bar\r\ncan be raised and lowered parallel to the ground for desired cutting\r\nheights, and it can be lifted and fastened in an upright position for\r\ntransport to and from the field. Mowers cut more rapidly and lower than\r\ndid reapers, and thus they used a different gear ratio; however, farmers\r\nsometimes used reapers for mowing. Gift of New York Historical\r\nAssociation, Cooperstown, New York.\r\n\r\n138. Spring-Tooth Hay Rake, late 19th century. USNM 213356; 1958.

USNM 213356; 1958. A\r\nhorse-powered treadmill made chiefly of wood, with metal parts where the\r\nwear would be greatest. It was used to produce power for belt-driven\r\nequipment such as threshers or fanning mills. The machine is set in\r\nmotion by putting a horse in the pen and releasing the brake. The weight\r\nof the horse causes the slats to move endlessly, which in turn rotates\r\nthe belting wheel. Two-horse treadmills also were used, but such\r\nmachines, although portable, worked less efficiently than the\r\nsweep-power machines. This treadmill was made in Vermont. Gift of New\r\nYork Historical Association, Cooperstown, New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--Dog-powered churn, 1881. (Catalog No. 140.)]\r\n\r\n140. Dog-Powered Churn, 1881. USNM 213356; 1958. H. M. Childs of Utica,\r\nNew York, patented this dog-powered churn in 1871, with improvements\r\npatented in 1881. A dog, tied or strapped into the pen, ran forward and\r\nso moved the slats of the treadmill which in turn rotated a flywheel.\r\nAttached to the flywheel is a pitman rod which raises and lowers a churn\r\ndasher. Devices of this sort had appeared earlier for use in the\r\nfarm-dairy industry. The change of direction effected by the pitman rod\r\ncaused some loss of energy; in any case, a revolving barrel-churn proved\r\nmore efficient in the long run. Gift of New York Historical Association,\r\nCooperstown, New York.\r\n\r\n141. Winnowing Basket, about 1800. USNM 213356; 1958. The winnowing\r\nbasket was used to work off the chaff from the threshed grain. When the\r\ngrain was tossed into the air, the wind would blow away the chaff and\r\nthe grain would fall back into the basket. Sometimes the grain would be\r\npoured from another basket into a winnowing basket, with the wind doing\r\nthe winnowing. Gift of New York Historical Association, Cooperstown, New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--Avery Bulldog tractor, about 1919. (Catalog\r\nNo. 142.)]\r\n\r\n142. Avery Bulldog Tractor, 1919. USNM 222860; 1958. This is one of the\r\nseveral makes of tractors which set a trend toward lighter tractors\r\nabout the time of World War I.

Gift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n145. Harness Vise, probably mid 19th century. USNM 230323; 1958. This\r\nwooden device could be used to pry open the jaws of a recalcitrant\r\nhorse. More often, it held parts of the harness as the saddler worked.\r\nGift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture.\r\n\r\n146. Wooden Hand Fork, late 19th century. USNM 230323; 1958. A wooden\r\npitchfork for handling hay, straw, and the like. The metal pitchfork\r\ngradually replaced these wooden forks between the middle and end of the\r\n19th century. Gift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture.\r\n\r\n147. Horse-Drawn Hayfork, late 19th century. USNM 230323; 1959. The fork\r\nwas driven into the hay and the handle compressed until it latched. A\r\nrope was attached to the fork, run up over a pully in the barn, and\r\nthen down to a horse. In this way the hay could be lifted into the barn.\r\nGift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture.\r\n\r\n148. Horse-Drawn Planter, 1856. USNM 230323; 1958. E. C. Fairchild of\r\nDeerfield, Massachusetts, made this planter, which has compartments for\r\nseeds and fertilizer. As the drive-wheel pulled a sliding bar back and\r\nforth, seeds and fertilizer alternately dropped into the ground. The\r\nspacing of seeds and fertilizer could be set by adjusting the metal bar.\r\nGift of Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture.\r\n\r\n149. Fanning Mill, mid 19th century. USNM 230323; 1958. A machine for\r\nwinnowing grain after it had been threshed. Grain fed into the machine\r\nlanded on vibrating screens which permitted the kernels to fall into the\r\npath of a draft of air which blew off the chaff and debris. The clean\r\ngrain fell into a container beneath the mill. The operator turned a\r\ncrank which operated both the screens and the fan. Gift of Massachusetts\r\nSociety for Promoting Agriculture.\r\n\r\n150. Hoe, mid 19th century. USNM 230322; 1958. A small hand hoe used for\r\ncultivating.
