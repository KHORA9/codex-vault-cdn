My excuse\r\nmust be that I have endeavoured to write a book which may render more\r\naccessible to students some of the important facts of Palaeobotany, and\r\nsuggest lines of investigation in a subject which Williamson had so\r\nthoroughly at heart.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Palaeobotany does not readily lend itself to adequate\r\ntreatment in a work intended for both geological and botanical\r\nstudents. The Botanist and Geologist are not always acquainted\r\nwith each other’s subject in a sufficient degree to appreciate the\r\nsignificance of Palaeobotany in its several points of contact with\r\nGeology and recent Botany. I have endeavoured to bear in mind the\r\npossibility that the following pages may be read by both non-geological\r\nand non-botanical students. It needs but a slight acquaintance with\r\nGeology for a Botanist to estimate the value of the most important\r\napplications of Palaeobotany; on the other hand, the bearing of fossil\r\nplants on the problems of phylogeny and descent cannot be adequately\r\nunderstood without a fairly intimate knowledge of recent Botany.\r\n\r\nThe student of elementary geology is not as a rule required to concern\r\nhimself with vegetable palaeontology, beyond a general acquaintance\r\nwith such facts as are to be found in geological text-books. The\r\nadvanced student will necessarily find in these pages much with which\r\nhe is already familiar; but this is to some extent unavoidable in a\r\nbook which is written with the dual object of appealing to Botanists\r\nand Geologists. While considering those who may wish to extend their\r\nbotanical or geological knowledge by an acquaintance with Palaeobotany,\r\nmy aim has been to keep in view the requirements of the student who\r\nmay be induced to approach the subject from the standpoint of an\r\noriginal investigator. As a possible assistance to those undertaking\r\nresearch in this promising field of work, I have given more references\r\nthan may seem appropriate to an introductory treatise, and there are\r\ncertain questions dealt with in greater detail than an elementary\r\ntreatment of the subject requires. In several instances references\r\nare given in the text or in footnotes to specimens of Coal-Measure\r\nplants in the Williamson cabinet of microscopic sections. Now that this\r\ninvaluable collection of slides has been acquired by the Trustees of\r\nthe British Museum, the student of Palaeobotany has the opportunity of\r\ninvestigating for himself the histology of Palaeozoic plants.\r\n\r\nMy plan has been to deal in some detail with certain selected types,\r\nand to refer briefly to such others as should be studied by anyone\r\ndesirous of pursuing the subject more thoroughly, rather than to cover\r\na wide range or to attempt to make the list of types complete. Of late\r\nyears there has been a much wider interest evinced by Botanists in\r\nthe study of fossil plants, and this is in great measure due to the\r\nvaluable and able work of Graf zu Solms-Laubach. His _Einleitung in\r\ndie Palaeophytologie_ must long remain a constant book of reference\r\nfor those engaged in palaeobotanical work. While referring to authors\r\nwho have advanced the study of petrified plants of the Coal period,\r\none should not forget the valuable services that have been rendered by\r\nsuch men as Butterworth, Binns, Wilde, Earnshaw, Spencer, Nield, Lomax\r\nand Hemingway, by whose skill the specimens described by Williamson and\r\nothers were first obtained and prepared for microscopical examination.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to many friends, both British and Continental, for help\r\nof various kinds. I would in the first place express my thanks to\r\nProfessor T. McKenny Hughes for having originally persuaded me to begin\r\nthe study of recent and fossil plants. I am indebted to Prof. Nathorst\r\nof Stockholm, Dr Hartz of Copenhagen, Prof. Zeiller, Dr Renault and\r\nProf. Munier-Chalmas of Paris, Prof. Bertrand of Lille, Prof. Stenzel\r\nand the late Prof. Roemer of Breslau, Dr Sterzel of Chemnitz, the\r\nlate Prof. Weiss of Berlin, the late Dr Stur of Vienna, and other\r\ncontinental workers, as well as to Mr Knowlton of Washington, for\r\nfacilities afforded me in the examination of fossil plant collections.\r\nMy thanks are due to the members of the Geological and Botanical\r\ndepartments of the British Museum; also to Mr E. T. Newton of the\r\nGeological Survey, and to those in charge of various provincial\r\nmuseums, for their never-failing kindness in offering me every\r\nassistance in the investigation of fossil plants under their charge.\r\nProf. Marshall Ward has given me the benefit of his criticism on the\r\nsection dealing with Fungi; and my friend Mr Alfred Harker has rendered\r\nme a similar service as regards the chapter on Geological History. I\r\nam especially grateful to my colleague, Mr Francis Darwin, for having\r\nread through the whole of the proofs of this volume. To Mr Shipley, as\r\nEditor, I am under a debt of obligation for suggestions and help in\r\nvarious forms. I would also express my sense of the unfailing courtesy\r\nand skill of the staff of the University Press.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mr Kidston of Stirling has always generously responded to my\r\nrequests for the loan of specimens from his private collection. Prof.\r\nBayley Balfour of Edinburgh, Mr Wethered of Cheltenham and others have\r\nassisted me in a similar manner. I would also express my gratitude\r\nto Dr Hoyle of Manchester, Mr Platnauer of York, and Mr Rowntree of\r\nScarborough for the loan of specimens.\r\n\r\nTo Dr Henry Woodward of the British Museum I am indebted for the loan\r\nof the woodblocks made use of in figs. 10, 47, 60, 66, and 101, and to\r\nMessrs Macmillan for the process-block of fig. 25.\r\n\r\nFor the photographs reproduced in figs. 15, 34, 68, 102 and 103 I owe\r\nan acknowledgment to Mr Edwin Wilson of Cambridge, and to my friend Mr\r\nC. A. Barber for the micro-photograph made use of in fig. 40.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I wish more particularly to thank my wife, who has drawn\r\nby far the greater number of the illustrations, and has in many other\r\nways assisted me in the preparation of this Volume.\r\n\r\nIn Volume II the Systematic treatment of Plants will be concluded,\r\nand the last chapters will be devoted to such subjects as geological\r\nfloras, plants as rock-builders, fossil plants and evolution, and other\r\ngeneral questions connected with Palaeobotany.\r\n\r\n                                                        A.

It would be out of place, in a short treatise like\r\nthe present, to attempt a detailed historical sketch, or to give an\r\nadequate account of the gradual rise and development of this modern\r\nscience. An excellent _Sketch of Palaeobotany_ has recently been drawn\r\nup by Prof. Lester Ward[1], of the United States Geological Survey, and\r\nan earlier historical retrospect may be found in the introduction to\r\nan important work by an eminent German palaeobotanist, the late Prof.\r\nGöppert[2]. In the well-known work by Parkinson on _The Organic Remains\r\nof a Former World_[3] there is much interesting information as to the\r\nearly history of our knowledge of fossil plants, as well as a good\r\nexposition of the views held at the beginning of this century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL PLANTS AND THE FLOOD.]\r\n\r\nAs a means of bringing into relief the modern development of the\r\nscience of fossil plants, we may briefly pass in review some of the\r\nearlier writers, who have concerned themselves in a greater or less\r\ndegree with a descriptive or speculative treatment of the records of a\r\npast vegetation. In the early part of the present century, and still\r\nmore in the eighteenth century, the occurrence of fossil plants and\r\nanimals in the earth’s crust formed the subject of animated, not to\r\nsay acrimonious, discussion. The result was that many striking and\r\ningenious theories were formulated as to the exact manner of formation\r\nof fossil remains, and the part played by the waters of the deluge in\r\ndepositing fossiliferous strata. The earlier views on fossil vegetables\r\nare naturally bound up with the gradual evolution of geological\r\nscience. It is from Italy that we seem to have the first glimmering\r\nof scientific views; but we are led to forget this early development\r\nof more than three hundred years ago, when we turn to the writings\r\nof English and other authors of the eighteenth century. “Under these\r\nwhite banks by the roadside,” as a writer on Verona has expressed it,\r\n“was born, like a poor Italian gipsy, the modern science of geology.”\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century the genius of Leonardo da Vinci[4]\r\ncompelled him to adopt a reasonable explanation of the occurrence of\r\nfossil shells in rocks far above the present sea-level. Another Italian\r\nwriter, Fracastaro, whose attention was directed to this matter by\r\nthe discovery of numerous shells brought to light by excavations at\r\nVerona, expressed his belief in the organic nature of the remains, and\r\nwent so far as to call in question the Mosaic deluge as a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the deposition of fossil-bearing strata.\r\n\r\nThe partial recognition by some observers of the true nature of fossils\r\nmarks the starting point of more rational views. The admission that\r\nfossils were not mere sports of nature, or the result of some wonderful\r\n‘vis lapidifica,’ was naturally followed by numerous speculations\r\nas to the manner in which the remains of animals and plants came\r\nto be embedded in rocks above the sea-level. For a long time, the\r\n‘universal flood’ was held responsible by nearly all writers for the\r\nexistence of fossils in ancient sediments. Dr John Woodward, in his\r\n_Essay toward a Natural History of the Earth_, propounded the somewhat\r\nrevolutionary theory, that “the whole terrestrial globe was taken all\r\nto pieces and dissolved at the Deluge, the particles of stone, marble,\r\nand all solid fossils dissevered, taken up into the water, and there\r\nsustained together with sea-shells and other animal and vegetable\r\nbodies: and that the present earth consists, and was formed out of that\r\npromiscuous mass of sand, earth, shells, and the rest falling down\r\nagain, and subsiding from the water[5].” In common with other writers,\r\nhe endeavoured to fix the exact date of the flood by means of fossil\r\nplants. Speaking of some hazel-nuts, which were found in a Cheshire\r\nmoss pit, he draws attention to their unripened condition, and adds:\r\n“The deluge came forth at the end of May, when nuts are not ripe.” As\r\nadditional evidence, he cites the occurrence of “Pine cones in their\r\nvernal state,” and of some Coal-Measure fossils which he compares with\r\nVirginian Maize, “tender, young, vernal, and not ripened[6].” Woodward\r\n(1665–1728) was Professor of Physic in Gresham College; he bequeathed\r\nhis geological collections to the University of Cambridge, and founded\r\nthe Chair which bears his name.\r\n\r\nAnother writer, Mendes da Costa, in a paper in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1758, speaks of the impressions of “ferns and\r\nreed-like plants” in the coal-beds, and describes some fossils\r\n(_Sigillaria_ and _Stigmaria_) as probably unknown forms of plant\r\nlife[7].\r\n\r\nHere we have the suggestion that in former ages there were plants\r\nwhich differed from those of the present age. Discussing the nature\r\nof some cones (_Lepidostrobi_) from the ironstone of Coalbrookdale\r\nin Shropshire, he concludes: “I firmly believe these bodies to be of\r\nvegetable origin, buried in the strata of the Earth at the time of the\r\nuniversal deluge recorded by Moses.” Scheuchzer of Zurich, the author\r\nof one of the earliest works on fossil plants and a “great apostle\r\nof the Flood Theory,” figures and describes a specimen as an ear of\r\ncorn, and refers to its size and general appearance as pointing to the\r\nmonth of May as the time of the deluge[8]. Another English writer, Dr\r\nParsons, in giving an account of the well-known ‘fossil fruits and\r\nother bodies found in the island of Sheppey,’ is disposed to dissent\r\nfrom Woodward’s views as to the time of the flood. He suggests that the\r\nfact of the Sheppey fruits being found in a perfectly ripe condition,\r\npoints to the autumn as the more probable time for the occurrence of\r\nthe deluge[9].\r\n\r\nIn looking through the works of the older writers, and occasionally\r\nin the pages of latter-day contributors, we frequently find curiously\r\nshaped stones, mineral markings on rock surfaces, or certain fossil\r\nanimals, described as fossil plants. In Plot’s _Natural History of\r\nOxfordshire_, published in 1705, a peculiarly shaped stone, probably a\r\nflint, is spoken of as one of the ‘Fungi lethales non esculenti[10]’;\r\nand again a piece of coral[11] is compared with a ‘Bryony root broken\r\noff transversely.’ On the other hand, that we may not undervalue\r\nthe painstaking and laborious efforts of those who helped to lay\r\nthe foundations of modern science, we may note that such authors as\r\nScheuchzer and Woodward were not misled by the moss-like or dendritic\r\nmarkings of oxide of manganese on the surface of rocks, which are not\r\ninfrequently seen to-day in the cabinets of amateurs as specimens of\r\nfossil plants.\r\n\r\nThe oldest figures of fossil plants from English rocks which are drawn\r\nwith any degree of accuracy are those of Coal-Measure ferns and other\r\nplants in an important work by Edward Lhwyd published at Oxford in\r\n1760[12].\r\n\r\nPassing beyond these prescientific speculations, brief reference may\r\nbe made to some of the more eminent pioneers of palaeobotany. The\r\nEnglishman Artis[13] deserves mention for the quality rather than the\r\nquantity of his contributions to Palaeozoic botany; and among American\r\nauthors Steinhauer’s[14] name must hold a prominent place in the list\r\nof those who helped to found this branch of palaeontology. Among\r\nGerman writers, Schlotheim stands out prominently as one who first\r\npublished a work on fossil plants which still remains an important\r\nbook of reference. Writing in 1804, he draws attention to the neglect\r\nof fossils from a scientific standpoint; they are simply looked upon,\r\nhe says, as “unimpeachable documents of the flood[15].” His book\r\ncontains excellent figures of many Coal-Measure plants, and we find in\r\nits pages occasional comparisons of fossil species with recent plants\r\nof tropical latitudes. Among the earlier authors whose writings soon\r\nbecome familiar to the student of fossil plants, reference must be\r\nmade to Graf Sternberg, who was born three years before Schlotheim,\r\nbut whose work came out some years later than that of the latter.\r\nHis great contribution to Fossil Botany entitled _Versuch einer\r\ngeognostisch-botanischen Darstellung der Flora der Vorwelt_, was\r\npublished in several parts between the years 1820 and 1838; it was\r\ndrawn up with the help of the botanist Presl, and included a valuable\r\ncontribution by Corda[16]. In addition to descriptions and numerous\r\nfigures of plants from several geological horizons, this important work\r\nincludes discussions on the formation of coal, with observations on the\r\nclimates of past ages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STERNBERG AND BRONGNIART.]\r\n\r\nSternberg endeavoured to apply to fossil plants the same methods of\r\ntreatment as those made use of in the case of recent species. About\r\nthe same time as Sternberg’s earlier parts were published, Adolphe\r\nBrongniart[17] of Paris began to enrich palaeobotanical science by\r\nthose splendid researches which have won for him the title of the\r\n“Father of palaeobotany.” In Brongniart’s _Prodrome_, and _Histoire des\r\nvégétaux fossiles_, and later in his _Tableau des genres de végétaux\r\nfossiles_, we have not merely careful descriptions and a systematic\r\narrangement of the known species of fossil plants, but a masterly\r\nscientific treatise on palaeobotany in its various aspects, which\r\nhas to a large extent formed the model for the best subsequent works\r\non similar lines. From the same author, at a later date, there is at\r\nleast one contribution to fossil plant literature which must receive\r\na passing notice even in this short sketch. In 1839 he published an\r\nexhaustive account of the minute structure of one of the well-known\r\nPalaeozoic genera, _Sigillaria_; this is not only one of the best\r\nof the earliest monographs on the histology of fossil species, but\r\nit is one of the few existing accounts of the internal structure of\r\nthis common type[18]. The fragment of a Sigillarian stem which formed\r\nthe subject of Brongniart’s memoir is in the Natural History Museum\r\nin the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. It affords a striking example of\r\nthe perfection of preservation as well as of the great beauty of the\r\nsilicified specimens from Autun, in Central France. Brongniart was\r\nnot only a remarkably gifted investigator, whose labours extend over\r\na period connecting the older and more crude methods of descriptive\r\ntreatment with the modern development of microscopic analysis, but\r\nhe possessed the power of inspiring a younger generation with a\r\ndetermination to keep up the high standard of the palaeobotanical\r\nachievements of the French School. In some cases, indeed, his\r\ndisciples have allowed a natural reverence for the Master to warp\r\ntheir scientific judgement, where our more complete knowledge has\r\nnaturally led to the correction of some of Brongniart’s conclusions.\r\nWithout attempting to follow the history of the science to more recent\r\ntimes, the names of Heer, Lesquereux, Zigno, Massalongo, Saporta and\r\nEttingshausen should be included among those who rendered signal\r\nservice to the science of fossil plants. The two Swiss writers,\r\nHeer[19] and Lesquereux[20], contributed numerous books and papers\r\non palaeobotanical subjects, the former being especially well known\r\nin connection with the fossil floras of Switzerland and of Arctic\r\nlands, and the latter for his valuable writings on the fossil plants\r\nof his adopted country, North America. Zigno[21] and Massalongo[22]\r\nperformed like services for Italy, and the Marquis of Saporta’s name\r\nwill always hold an honourable and prominent position in the list of\r\nthe pioneers of scientific palaeobotany; his work on the Tertiary and\r\nMesozoic floras of France being specially noteworthy among the able\r\ninvestigations which we owe to his ability and enthusiasm[23]. In Baron\r\nEttingshausen[24] we have another representative of those students\r\nof ancient vegetation who have done so much towards establishing the\r\nscience of fossil plants on a philosophical basis.\r\n\r\nAs in other fields of Natural Science, so also in a marked degree in\r\nfossil botany, a new stimulus was given to scientific inquiry by the\r\napplication of the microscope to palaeobotanical investigation. In\r\n1828 Sprengel published a work entitled _Commentatio de Psarolithis,\r\nligni fossilis genere_[25]; in which he dealt in some detail with\r\nthe well-known silicified fern-stems of Palaeozoic age, from Saxony,\r\nbasing his descriptions on the characteristics of anatomical structure\r\nrevealed by microscopic examination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL PLANTS.]\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Henry Witham of Lartington brought out a work on _The Internal\r\nStructure of Fossil Vegetables_[26]; this book, following the much\r\nsmaller and less important work by Sprengel, at once established\r\npalaeobotany on a firmer scientific basis, and formed the starting\r\npoint for those more accurate methods of research, which have yielded\r\nsuch astonishing results in the hands of modern workers. In the\r\nintroduction Witham writes, “My principal object in presenting this\r\nwork to the public, is to impress upon geologists the advantage of\r\nattending more particularly to the intimate organization of fossil\r\nplants; and should I succeed in directing their efforts towards\r\nthe elucidation of this obscure subject, I shall feel a degree of\r\nsatisfaction which will amply repay my labour[27].”\r\n\r\nOn another page he writes as follows,—“From investigations made by\r\nthe most active and experienced botanical geologists, we find reason\r\nto conclude that the first appearance of an extensive vegetation\r\noccurred in the Carboniferous series; and from a recent examination\r\nof the mountain-limestone groups and coal-fields of Scotland, and the\r\nnorth of England, we learn that these early vegetable productions, so\r\nfar from being simple in their structure, as had been supposed, are\r\nas complicated as the phanerogamic plants of the present day. This\r\ndiscovery necessarily tends to destroy the once favourite idea, that,\r\nfrom the oldest to the most recent strata, there has been a progressive\r\ndevelopment of vegetable and animal forms, from the simplest to the\r\nmost complex[28].” Since Witham’s day we have learnt much as to the\r\nmorphology of Palaeozoic plants, and can well understand the opinions\r\nto which he thus gives expression.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to overrate the immense importance of this\r\npublication from the point of view of modern palaeobotany.\r\n\r\nThe art of making transparent sections of the tissues of fossil\r\nplants seems to have been first employed by Sanderson, a lapidary,\r\nand it was afterwards considerably improved by Nicol[29]. This most\r\nimportant advance in methods of examination gave a new impetus to\r\nthe subject, but it is somewhat remarkable that the possibilities of\r\nthe microscopical investigation of fossil plants have been but very\r\nimperfectly realised by botanical workers until quite recent years. As\r\nregards such a flora as that of the Coal-Measures, we can endorse the\r\nopinion expressed at the beginning of the century in reference to the\r\nstudy of recent mosses—“Ohne das Göttergeschenk des zusammengesetzten\r\nMikroskops ist auf diesem Felde durchaus keine Ernte[30].” A useful\r\nsummary of the history of the study of internal structure is given\r\nby Knowlton in a memoir published in 1889[31]. Not long after\r\nWitham’s book was issued there appeared a work of exceptional merit\r\nby Corda[32], in which numerous Palaeozoic plants are figured and\r\nfully described, mainly from the standpoint of internal structure.\r\nThis author lays special stress on the importance of studying the\r\nmicroscopical structure of fossil plants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENGLISH PALAEOBOTANISTS.]\r\n\r\nWithout pausing to enumerate the contributions of such well-known\r\ncontinental authors as Göppert, Cotta, Schimper, Stenzel, Schenk and\r\na host of others, we may glance for a moment at the services rendered\r\nby English investigators to the study of palaeobotanical histology.\r\nUnfortunately we cannot always extend our examination of fossil plants\r\nbeyond the characters of external form and surface markings; but in\r\na few districts there are preserved remnants of ancient floras in\r\nwhich fragments of stems, roots, leaves and other structures have been\r\npetrified in such a manner as to retain with wonderful completeness\r\nthe minute structure of their internal tissues. During the deposition\r\nof the coal seams in parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire the conditions\r\nof fossilisation were exceptionally favourable, and thus English\r\ninvestigators have been fortunately placed for conducting researches on\r\nthe minute anatomy of the Coal-Measure plants. The late Mr Binney of\r\nManchester did excellent service by his work on the internal structure\r\nof some of the trees of the Coal Period forests. In his introductory\r\nremarks to a monograph on the genus _Calamites_, after speaking of\r\nthe desirability of describing our English specimens, he goes on to\r\nsay, “When this is done, we are likely to possess a literature on our\r\nCarboniferous fossils worthy of the first coal-producing country[33].”\r\nThe continuation and extension of Binney’s work in the hands of\r\nCarruthers, Williamson, and others, whose botanical qualifications\r\nenabled them to produce work of greater scientific value, has gone far\r\ntowards the fulfilment of Binney’s prophecy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFICULTIES OF IDENTIFICATION.]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the structure of Palaeozoic plants, we shall be\r\nunder constant obligation to the splendid series of memoirs from\r\nthe pen of Prof. Williamson[34]. As the writer of a sympathetic\r\nobituary notice has well said: “In his fifty-fifth year he began\r\nthe great series of memoirs which mark the culminating point of his\r\nscientific activity, and which will assure to him, for all time, in\r\nconjunction with Brongniart, the honourable title of a founder of\r\nmodern Palaeobotany[35].” If we look back through a few decades,\r\nand peruse the pages of Lindley and Hutton’s classic work[36] on\r\nthe Fossil flora of Great Britain, a book which is indispensable\r\nto fossil botanists, and read the description of such a genus as\r\n_Sigillaria_ or _Stigmaria_; or if we extend our retrospect to an\r\nearlier period and read Woodward’s description of an unusually good\r\nspecimen of a _Lepidodendron_, and finally take stock of our present\r\nknowledge of such plants, we realise what enormous progress has been\r\nmade in palaeobotanical studies. Lindley and Hutton, in the preface\r\nto the first volume of the Flora, claim to have demonstrated that\r\nboth _Sigillaria_ and _Stigmaria_ were plants with “the highest\r\ndegree of organization, such as _Cactaeae_, or _Euphorbiaceae_, or\r\neven _Asclepiadeae_”; Woodward describes his _Lepidodendron_ (Fig. 1)\r\nas “an ironstone, black and flat, and wrought over one surface very\r\nfinely, with a strange cancellated work[37].” Thanks largely to the\r\nwork of Binney, Carruthers, Hooker, Williamson, and to the labours\r\nof continental botanists, we are at present almost as familiar with\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and several other Coal-Measure genera as with the\r\nstructure of a recent forest tree. While emphasizing the value of the\r\nmicroscopic methods of investigation, we are not disposed to take such\r\na hopeless view of the possibilities of the determination of fossil\r\nforms, in which no internal structure is preserved, as some writers\r\nhave expressed. The preservation of minute structure is to be greatly\r\ndesired from the point of view of the modern palaeobotanist, but he\r\nmust recognise the necessity of making such use as he can of the\r\nnumberless examples of plants of all ages, which occur only in the form\r\nof structureless casts or impressions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Four leaf-cushions of a _Lepidodendron_. Drawn\r\n  from a specimen in the Woodward Collection, Cambridge. (Nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nIn looking through the writings of the earlier authors we cannot help\r\nnoticing their anxiety to match all fossil plants with living species;\r\nbut by degrees it was discovered that fossils are frequently the\r\nfragmentary samples of extinct types, which can be studied only under\r\nvery unfavourable conditions. In the absence of those characters on\r\nwhich the student of living plants relies as guides to classification,\r\nit is usually impossible to arrive at any trustworthy conclusions as\r\nto precise botanical affinity. Brongniart and other authors recognised\r\nthis fact, and instituted several convenient generic terms of a purely\r\nartificial and provisional nature, which are still in general use. The\r\ndangers and risks of error which necessarily attend our attempts to\r\ndetermine small and imperfect fragments of extinct species of plants,\r\nwill be briefly touched on in another place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n            RELATION OF PALAEOBOTANY TO BOTANY AND GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n  “La recherche du plan de la création, voilà le but vers lequel nos\r\n  efforts peuvent tendre aujourd’hui.” GAUDRY, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the greater refinements and thoroughness of scientific methods\r\nand the enormous and ever-increasing mass of literature have inevitably\r\nled to extreme specialisation, it is more than ever important to look\r\nbeyond the immediate limits of one’s own subject, and to note its\r\npoints of contact with other lines of research. A palaeobotanist is\r\nprimarily concerned with the determination and description of fossil\r\nplants, but he must at the same time constantly keep in view the\r\nbearing of his work on wider questions of botanical or geological\r\nimportance. From the nature of the case, we have in due measure to\r\nadapt the methods of work to the particular conditions before us. It is\r\nimpossible to follow in the case of all fossil species precisely the\r\nsame treatment as with the more complete and perfect recent plants;\r\nbut it is of the utmost importance for a student of palaeobotany, by\r\nadhering to the methods of recent botany, to preserve as far as he is\r\nable the continuity of the past and present floras. Palaeontological\r\nwork has often been undertaken by men who are pure geologists, and\r\nwhose knowledge of zoology or botany is of the most superficial\r\ncharacter, with the result that biologists have not been able to avail\r\nthemselves, to any considerable extent, of the records of extinct forms\r\nof life. They find the literature is often characterised by a special\r\npalaeontological phraseology, and by particular methods of treatment,\r\nwhich are unknown to the student of living plants and animals. From\r\nthis and other causes a purely artificial division has been made\r\nbetween the science of the organic world of to-day and that of the past.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEGLECT OF FOSSILS BY BOTANISTS.]\r\n\r\nFossils are naturally regarded by a stratigraphical geologist\r\nas records which enable him to determine the relative age of\r\nfossil-bearing rocks. For such a purpose it is superfluous to inquire\r\ninto the questions of biological interest which centre round the\r\nrelics of ancient floras. Primarily concerned, therefore, with fixing\r\nthe age of strata, it is easy to understand how geologists have been\r\ncontent with a special kind of palaeontology which is out of touch\r\nwith the methods of systematic zoology or botany. On the other hand,\r\nthe botanist whose observations and researches have not extended\r\nbeyond the limits of existing plants, sees in the vast majority of\r\nfossil forms merely imperfect specimens, which it is impossible to\r\ndetermine with any degree of scientific accuracy. He prefers to wait\r\nfor perfect material; or in other words, he decides that fossils must\r\nbe regarded as outside the range of taxonomic botany. It would seem,\r\nthen, that the unsatisfactory treatment or comparative neglect of\r\nfossil plants, has been in a large measure due to the narrowness of\r\nview which too often characterises palaeobotanical literature. This\r\nhas at once repelled those who have made a slight effort to recognise\r\nthe subject, and has resulted in a one-sided and, from a biological\r\nstandpoint, unscientific treatment of this branch of science. It must\r\nbe admitted that palaeobotanists have frequently brought the subject\r\ninto disrepute by their over-anxiety to institute specific names for\r\nfragments which it is quite impossible to identify. This over-eagerness\r\nto determine imperfect specimens, and the practice of drawing\r\nconclusions as to botanical affinity without any trustworthy evidence,\r\nhave naturally given rise to considerable scepticism as to the value\r\nof palaeobotanical records. Another point, which will be dealt with\r\nat greater length in a later chapter, is that geologists have usually\r\nshown a distinct prejudice against fossil plants as indices of\r\ngeological age; this again, is no doubt to a large extent the result of\r\nimperfect and inaccurate methods of description, and of the neglect of\r\nand consequent imperfect acquaintance with fossil plants as compared\r\nwith fossil animals.\r\n\r\nThe student of fossil plants should endeavour to keep before him the\r\nfact that the chief object of his work is to deal with the available\r\nmaterial in the most natural and scientific manner; and by adopting\r\nthe methods of modern botany, he should always aim to follow such\r\nlines as may best preserve the continuity of past and present types\r\nof plants. Descriptions of floras of past ages and lists of fossil\r\nspecies, should be so compiled that they may serve the same purpose to\r\na stratigraphical geologist, who is practically a geographer of former\r\nperiods of the Earth’s history, as the accounts of existing floras\r\nto students of present day physiography. The effect of carrying out\r\nresearches on some such lines as these, should be to render available\r\nto both botanists and geologists the results of the specialist’s work.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, palaeobotanical investigations may be of the utmost\r\nservice to botanical science, and of little or no value to geology.\r\nThe discovery of a completely preserved gametophyte of _Lepidodendron_\r\nor _Calamites_, or of a petrified Moss plant in Palaeozoic rocks would\r\nappeal to most botanists as a matter of primary importance, but for the\r\nstratigraphical geologist such discoveries would possess but little\r\nvalue. On the other hand the discovery of some characteristic species\r\nof Coal-Measure plants from a deep boring through Mesozoic or Tertiary\r\nstrata might be a matter of special geological importance, but to the\r\nbotanist it would be of no scientific value. In very many instances,\r\nhowever, if the palaeobotanist follows such lines as have been briefly\r\nsuggested, the results of his labours should be at once useful and\r\nreadily accessible to botanists and geologists. As Humboldt has said\r\nin speaking of Palaeontology, “the analytical study of primitive\r\nanimal and vegetable life has taken a double direction; the one is\r\npurely morphological, and embraces especially the natural history\r\nand physiology of organisms, filling up the chasms in the series of\r\nstill living species by the fossil structures of the primitive world.\r\nThe second is more specially geognostic, considering fossil remains\r\nin their relations to the superposition and relative age of the\r\nsedimentary formations[38].”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL PLANTS AND DISTRIBUTION.]\r\n\r\nTo turn for a moment to some of the most obvious connections between\r\npalaeobotany and the wider sciences of botany and geology. The records\r\nof fossil species must occupy a prominent position in the data by\r\nwhich we may hope to solve some at least of the problems of plant\r\nevolution. From the point of view of distribution, palaeobotany is of\r\nconsiderable value, not only to the student of geographical botany, but\r\nto the geologist, who endeavours to map out the positions of ancient\r\ncontinents with the help of palaeontological evidence. The present\r\ndistribution of plants and animals represents but one chapter in the\r\nhistory of life on the Earth; and to understand or appreciate the facts\r\nwhich it records, we have to look back through such pages as have been\r\ndeciphered in the earlier chapters of the volume. The distribution of\r\nfossil plants lies at the foundation of the principles of the present\r\ngrouping of floras on the Earth’s surface. Those who have confined\r\ntheir study of distribution to the plant geography of the present\r\nage, must supplement their investigations by reference to the work of\r\npalaeobotanical writers. If the lists of plant species drawn up by\r\nspecialists in fossil botany, have been prepared with a due sense of\r\nthe important conclusions which botanists may draw from them from the\r\nstandpoint of distribution, they will be readily accepted as sound\r\nlinks in the chain of evidence. Unfortunately, however, if many of\r\nthe lists of ancient floras were made use of in such investigations,\r\nthe conclusions arrived at would frequently be of little value on\r\naccount of the untrustworthy determinations of many of the species.\r\nIn the case of particular genera the study of the distribution of\r\nthe former species both in time and space, that is geologically and\r\ngeographically, points to rational explanations of, or gives added\r\nsignificance to, the facts of present day distribution. That isolated\r\nconifer, _Ginkgo biloba_ L. now restricted to Japan and China, was in\r\nformer times abundant in Europe and in other parts of the world. It is\r\nclearly an exceedingly ancient type, isolated not only in geographical\r\ndistribution but in botanical affinities, which has reached the last\r\nstage in its natural life. The Mammoth trees of California (_Sequoia\r\nsempervirens_ Endl., and _S. gigantea_ Lindl. and Gord.) afford other\r\nexamples of a parallel case. The Tulip tree of North America and China\r\nand other allied forms are fairly common in the Tertiary plant beds\r\nof Europe, but the living representatives are now exclusively North\r\nAmerican. Such differences in distribution as are illustrated by these\r\ndicotyledonous forest trees in Tertiary times and at the present day,\r\nhave been clearly explained with the help of the geological record.\r\nForbes, Darwin, Asa Gray[39] and others have been able to explain many\r\napparent anomalies in the distribution of existing plants, and to\r\nreconcile the differences between the past and present distribution\r\nof many genera by taking account of the effect on plant life of the\r\nglacial period. As the ice gradually crept down from the polar regions\r\nand spread over the northern parts of Europe, many plants were driven\r\nfurther south in search of the necessary warmth. In the American\r\ncontinent such migration was rendered possible by the southern land\r\nextension; in Europe on the other hand the southerly retreat was cut\r\noff by impassable barriers, and the extinction of several genera was\r\nthe natural result.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively abundant information which we possess as to the\r\npast vegetation of polar regions and the value of such knowledge to\r\ngeologists and botanists alike is in striking contrast to the absence\r\nof similar data as regards Antarctic fossils. Darwin in an exceedingly\r\ninteresting letter to Hooker _à propos_ of a forthcoming British\r\nAssociation address, referring to this subject writes as follows:—\r\n\r\n“The extreme importance of the Arctic fossil plants is self-evident.\r\nTake the opportunity of groaning over our ignorance of the Lignite\r\nplants of Kerguelen Land, or any Antarctic land. It might do good[40].”\r\n\r\nIn working out any collection of fossil plants, it would be well,\r\ntherefore, to bear in mind that our aim should be rather to reproduce\r\nan accurate fragment of botanical history, than to perform feats of\r\ndetermination with hopelessly inadequate specimens. Had this principle\r\nbeen generally followed, the number of fossil plant species would be\r\nenormously reduced, but the value of the records would be considerably\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL PLANTS AND CLIMATE.]\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of plant anatomy, and of those laws of growth which\r\ngovern certain classes of plants to-day and in past time, has been very\r\nmaterially widened and extended by the facts revealed to us by the\r\ndetailed study of Coal-Measure species. The modern science of Plant\r\nBiology, refounded by Charles Darwin, has thrown considerable light\r\non the laws of plant life, and it enables us to correlate structural\r\ncharacteristics with physiological conditions of growth. Applying the\r\nknowledge gained from living plants to the study of such extinct types\r\nas permit of close microscopic examination, we may obtain a glimpse\r\ninto the secrets of the botanical binomics of Palaeozoic times. The\r\nwider questions of climatic conditions depend very largely upon the\r\nevidence of fossil botany for a rational solution. As an instance\r\nof the best authenticated and most striking alternation in climatic\r\nconditions in comparatively recent times, we may cite the glacial\r\nperiod or Ice-Age. The existence of Arctic conditions has been proved\r\nby purely geological evidence, but it receives additional confirmation,\r\nand derives a wider importance from the testimony of fossil plants. In\r\nrocks deposited before the spread of ice from high northern latitudes,\r\nwe find indubitable proofs of a widely distributed subtropical flora in\r\nCentral and Northern Europe. Passing from these rocks to more recent\r\nbeds there are found indications of a fall in temperature, and such\r\nnorthern plants as the dwarf Birch, the Arctic Willow and others reveal\r\nthe southern extension of Arctic cold to our own latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of plants in time, that is the range of classes,\r\nfamilies, genera and species of plants through the series of strata\r\nwhich make up the crust of the earth, is a matter of primary importance\r\nfrom a botanical as well as from a geological point of view.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier writers, Brongniart recognised the marked differences\r\nbetween the earlier and later floras, and attempted to correlate\r\nthe periods of maximum development of certain classes of plants\r\nwith definite epochs of geological history. He gives the following\r\nclassification in which are represented the general outlines of plant\r\ndevelopment from Palaeozoic to Tertiary times[41].\r\n\r\n    I. Reign of Acrogens    ╭ 1. Carboniferous epoch.\r\n                            ╰ 2. Permian epoch.\r\n\r\n   II. Reign of Gymnosperms ╭ 3. Triassic epoch.\r\n                            ╰ 4. Jurassic epoch (including the Wealden).\r\n\r\n  III. Reign of Angiosperms ╭ 5. Cretaceous epoch.\r\n                            ╰ 6. Tertiary epoch.\r\n\r\nSince Brongniart’s time this method of classification has been\r\nextended to many of the smaller subdivisions of the geological epochs,\r\nand species of fossil plants are often of the greatest value in\r\nquestions of correlation. In recent years the systematic treatment\r\nof Coal-Measure and other plants in the hands of various Continental\r\nand English writers has clearly demonstrated their capabilities\r\nfor the purpose of subdividing a series of strata into stages and\r\nzones[42]. The more complete becomes our knowledge of any flora, the\r\ngreater possibility there is of making use of the plants as indices of\r\ngeological age[43].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL PLANTS AND PHYLOGENY.]\r\n\r\nNot only is it possible to derive valuable aid in the correlation of\r\nstrata from the facts of plant distribution, but we may often follow\r\nthe various stages in the history of a particular genus as we trace\r\nthe records of its occurrence through the geologic series. In studying\r\nthe march of plant life through past ages, the botanist may sometimes\r\nfollow the progress of a genus from its first appearance, through the\r\ntime of maximum development, to its decline or extinction. In the\r\nPalaeozoic forests there was perhaps no more conspicuous or common tree\r\nthan the genus long known under the name of _Calamites_. This plant\r\nattained a height of fifty or a hundred feet, with a proportionate\r\ngirth, and increased in thickness in a manner precisely similar to\r\nthat in which our forest trees grow in diameter. The exceptionally\r\nfavourable conditions under which specimens of calamitean plants\r\nhave been preserved, have enabled us to become almost as familiar\r\nwith the minute structure of their stems and roots, as well as with\r\ntheir spore-producing organs, as with those of a living species.\r\nIn short, it is thoroughly established that _Calamites_ agrees in\r\nmost essential respects with our well known _Equisetum_, and must\r\nbe included in the same order, or at least sub-class, as the recent\r\ngenus of _Equisetaceae_. As we ascend the geologic series from the\r\nCoal-Measures, a marked numerical decline of _Calamites_ is obvious\r\nin the Permian period, and in the red sandstones of the Vosges, which\r\nbelong to the same series of rocks as the Triassic strata of the\r\nCheshire plain, the true _Calamites_ is replaced by a large _Equisetum_\r\napparently identical in external appearance and habit of growth with\r\nthe species living to-day. In the more recent strata the Horse-tails\r\nare still represented, but the size of the Tertiary species agrees\r\nmore closely with the comparatively small forms which have such a\r\nwide geographical distribution at the present time. Thus we are able\r\nto trace out the history of a recent genus of Vascular Cryptogams,\r\nand to follow a particular type of organisation from the time of its\r\nmaximum development, through its gradual transition to those structural\r\ncharacters which are represented in the living descendants of the\r\narborescent Calamites of the coal-period forests. The pages of such a\r\nhistory are frequently imperfect and occasionally missing, but others,\r\nagain, are written in characters as clear as those which we decipher by\r\na microscopical examination of the tissues of a recent plant.\r\n\r\nAs one of the most striking instances in which the microscopic study\r\nof fossil plants has shown the way to a satisfactory solution of\r\nthe problems of development, we may mention such extinct genera as\r\n_Lyginodendron_, _Myeloxylon_ and others. Each of these genera will be\r\ndealt with at some length in the systematic part of the book, and we\r\nshall afterwards discuss the importance of such types, from the point\r\nof view of plant evolution.\r\n\r\nThe botanist who would trace out the phylogeny of any existing class or\r\nfamily, makes it his chief aim to discover points of contact between\r\nthe particular type of structure which he is investigating, and that of\r\nother more or less closely related classes or families.\r\n\r\nConfining himself to recent forms, he may discover, here and there,\r\ncertain anatomical or embryological facts, which suggest promising\r\nlines of inquiry in the quest after such affinities as point to a\r\ncommon descent. Without recourse to the evidence afforded by the plants\r\nof past ages, we must always admit that our existing classification\r\nof the vegetable kingdom is an expression of real gaps which separate\r\nthe several classes of plants from one another. On the other hand our\r\nrecently acquired and more accurate knowledge of such genera as have\r\nbeen alluded to, has made us acquainted with types of plant structure\r\nwhich enable us to fill in some of the lacunae in our existing\r\nclassification. In certain instances we find merged in a single species\r\nmorphological characteristics which, in the case of recent plants, are\r\nregarded as distinctive features of different subdivisions. It has\r\nbeen clearly demonstrated that in _Lyginodendron_, we have anatomical\r\npeculiarities typical of recent cycads, combined with structural\r\ncharacteristics always associated with existing ferns. In rare cases,\r\nit happens that the remarkably perfect fossilisation of the tissues of\r\nfossil plants, enables us not only to give a complete description of\r\nthe histology of extinct forms, but also to speak with confidence as to\r\nsome of those physiological processes which governed their life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GEOLOGICAL HISTORY.]\r\n\r\nSo far, palaeobotany has been considered in its bearings on the\r\nstudy of recent plants. From a geological point of view the records\r\nof ancient floras have scarcely less importance. In recent years,\r\nfacts have been brought to light, which show that plants have played\r\na more conspicuous part than has usually been supposed as agents of\r\nrock-building. As tests of geologic age, there are good grounds for\r\nbelieving that the inferiority of plants to animals is more apparent\r\nthan real. This question, however, must be discussed at greater length\r\nin a later chapter.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show the many-sided nature of the science of\r\nFossil Plants, and the wide range of the problems which the geologist\r\nor botanist may reasonably expect to solve, by means of trustworthy\r\ndata afforded by scientific palaeobotanical methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                          GEOLOGICAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n  “But how can we question dumb rocks whose speech is not clear[44]?”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn attempting to sketch in briefest outline the geological history\r\nof the Earth, the most important object to keep in view is that of\r\nreproducing as far as possible the broad features of the successive\r\nstages in the building of the Earth’s crust. It is obviously\r\nimpossible to go into any details of description, or to closely\r\nfollow the evolution of the present continents; at most, we can only\r\nrefer to such facts as may serve as an introduction of the elements\r\nof stratigraphical geology to non-geological readers. For a fuller\r\ntreatment of the subject reference must be made to special treatises on\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of convenience, it is customary in stratigraphical geology\r\nas also in biology, to make use of our imperfect knowledge as an aid\r\nto classification. If we possessed complete records of the Earth’s\r\nhistory, we should have an unbroken sequence, not merely of the various\r\nforms of life that ever existed, but of the different kinds of rocks\r\nformed in the successive ages of past time. As gaps exist in the chain\r\nof life, so also do we find considerable breaks in the sequence of\r\nstrata which have been formed since the beginning of geologic time. The\r\ndanger as well as the convenience of artificial classification must be\r\nkept in view. This has been well expressed by Freeman, in speaking of\r\narchitectural styles,—“Our minds,” he says, “are more used to definite\r\nperiods; they neglect or forget transitions which do indeed exist[45].”\r\nThe idea of definite classification is liable to narrow our view of\r\nuniformity and the natural sequence of events.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROCK-BUILDING.]\r\n\r\nComposing that part of the earth which is accessible to us,—or as it is\r\ngenerally called the earth’s crust,—there are rocks of various kinds,\r\nof which some have been formed by igneous agency, either as lavas or\r\nbeds of ashes, or in the form of molten magmas which gradually cooled\r\nand became crystalline below a mass of superincumbent strata. With\r\nthese rocks we need not concern ourselves.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the earth’s crust consists of such materials as\r\nsandstones, limestones, shales, and similar strata which have been\r\nformed in precisely the same manner as deposits are being accumulated\r\nat the present day. The whole surface of the earth is continually\r\nexposed to the action of destructive agencies, and suffers perpetual\r\ndecay; it is the products of this ceaseless wear and tear that form the\r\nbuilding materials of new deposits.\r\n\r\nThe operation of water in its various forms, of wind, changes of\r\ntemperature, and other agents of destruction cannot be fully dealt with\r\nin this short summary.\r\n\r\nA river flowing to the sea or emptying itself into an inland lake,\r\ncarries its burden of gravel, sand, and mud, and sooner or later, as\r\nthe rate of flow slackens, it deposits the materials in the river-bed\r\nor on the floor of the sea or lake.\r\n\r\nFragments of rock, chipped off by wedges of ice, or detached in other\r\nways from the parent mass, find their way to the mountain streams,\r\nand if not too heavy are conveyed to the main river, where the larger\r\npieces come to rest as more or less rounded pebbles. Such water-worn\r\nrocks accumulate in the quieter reaches of a swiftly flowing river, or\r\nare thrown down at the head of the river’s delta. If such a deposit\r\nof loose water-worn material became cemented together either by the\r\nconsolidating action of some solution percolating through the general\r\nmass, or by the pressure of overlying deposits, there would be formed\r\na hard rock made up of rounded fragments of various kinds of strata\r\nderived from different sources. Such a rock is known as a CONGLOMERATE.\r\nThe same kind of rock may be formed equally well by the action of the\r\nsea; an old sea-beach with the pebbles embedded in a cementing matrix\r\naffords a typical example of a coarse conglomerate. Plant remains are\r\noccasionally met with in conglomerates, but usually in a fragmentary\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nFrom a conglomerate composed of large water-worn pebbles, to a fine\r\nhomogeneous sandstone there are numerous intermediate stages. A body\r\nof water, with a velocity too small to carry along pebbles of rock in\r\nsuspension or to roll them along the bed of the channel, is still able\r\nto transport the finer fragments or grains of sand, but as a further\r\ndecrease in the velocity occurs, these are eventually deposited as beds\r\nof coarse or fine sand. The stretches of sand on a gradually shelving\r\nsea shore, or the deposits of the same material in a river’s delta,\r\nhave been formed by the gradual wearing away and disintegration of\r\nvarious rocks, the detritus of which has been spread out in more or\r\nless regular beds on the floor of a lake or sea. Such accumulations\r\nof fine detrital material, if compacted or cemented together, become\r\ntypical SANDSTONES.\r\n\r\nIn tracing beds of sandstone across a tract of country, it is\r\nfrequently found that the character of the strata gradually alters; mud\r\nor clay becomes associated with the sandy deposit, until finally the\r\nsandstone is replaced by beds of dark coloured shale. Similarly the\r\nsandy detritus on the ocean floor, or in an inland lake, when followed\r\nfurther and further from the source from which the materials were\r\nderived, passes by degrees into argillaceous sand, and finally into\r\nsheets of dark clay or mud. The hardened beds of clay or fine grained\r\nmud become transformed into SHALES. As a general rule, then, shales are\r\nrocks which have been laid down in places further from the land, or at\r\na greater distance from the source of origin of the detrital material,\r\nthan sandstones or conglomerates. The conglomerates, or old shingle\r\nbeaches, usually occur in somewhat irregular patches, marking old\r\nshore-lines or the head of a river delta. Coarse sandstones, or grits,\r\nmay occur in the form of regularly bedded strata stretching over a\r\nwide area; and shales or clays may be followed through a considerable\r\nextent of country. The finer material composing the clays and shales\r\nhas been held longer in suspension and deposited in deeper water in\r\nwidespread and fairly horizontal layers.\r\n\r\nIn some districts sandstones occur in which the individual grains\r\nshow a well marked rounding of the angles, and in which fossils\r\nare extremely rare or entirely absent. The close resemblance of\r\nsuch deposits to modern desert sands suggests a similar method of\r\nformation; and there can be no doubt that in some instances there have\r\nbeen preserved the wind-worn desert sands of former ages. Aeolian\r\nor wind-formed accumulations, although by no means common, are of\r\nsufficient importance to be mentioned as illustrating a certain type of\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CALCAREOUS ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nThe thick masses of limestone which form so prominent a feature in\r\nparts of England and Ireland, have been formed in a manner different\r\nfrom that to which sandstones and shales owe their origin. On the\r\nfloor of a clear sea, too far from land to receive any water-borne\r\nsediment, there is usually in process of formation a mass of calcareous\r\nmaterial, which in a later age may rise above the surface of the water\r\nas chalk or LIMESTONE. Those organisms living in the sea, which are\r\nenclosed either wholly or in part by calcareous shells, are agents of\r\nlimestone-building; their shells constantly accumulating on the floor\r\nof the sea give rise in course of time to a thick mass of sediment,\r\ncomposed in great part of carbonate of lime. Some of the shells in\r\nsuch a deposit may retain their original form, the calcareous body\r\nmay on the other hand be broken up into minute fragments which are\r\nstill recognisable with the help of a microscope, or the shells and\r\nother hard parts may be dissolved or disintegrated beyond recognition,\r\nleaving nothing in the calcareous sediment to indicate its method of\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nNot a few limestones consist in part of fossil corals, and owe their\r\norigin to colonies of coral polyps which built up reefs or banks of\r\ncoral in the ancient seas.\r\n\r\nIn the white cliffs of Dover, Flamborough Head and other places, we\r\nhave a somewhat different form of calcareous rock, which in part\r\nconsists of millions of minute shells of Foraminifera, in part of\r\nbroken fragments of larger shells of extinct molluscs, and to some\r\nextent of the remains of siliceous sponges. As a general rule,\r\nlimestones and chalk rocks are ancient sediments, formed in clear and\r\ncomparatively deep water, composed in the main of carbonate of lime,\r\nin some cases with a certain amount of carbonate of magnesium, and\r\noccasionally with a considerable admixture of silica.\r\n\r\nIn such rocks land-plants must necessarily be rare. There are, however,\r\nlimestones which wholly or in part owe their formation to masses of\r\ncalcareous algae, which grew in the form of submarine banks or on coral\r\nreefs. Occasionally the remains of these algae are clearly preserved,\r\nbut frequently all signs of plant structure have been completely\r\nobliterated. Again, there occur limestone rocks formed by chemical\r\nmeans, and in a manner similar to that in which beds of travertine are\r\nnow being accumulated.\r\n\r\nGranites, basalts, volcanic lavas, tuffs, and other igneous rocks\r\nneed not claim our attention, except in such cases as permit of plant\r\nremains being found in association with these materials. Showers of\r\nashes blown from a volcano, may fall on the surface of a lake or sea\r\nand become mixed with sand and mud of subaerial origin. Streams of lava\r\noccasionally flow into water, or they may be poured from submarine\r\nvents, and so spread out on the ocean bed with strata of sand or clay.\r\n\r\nPassing from the nature and mode of origin of the sedimentary strata to\r\nthe manner of their arrangement in the Earth’s crust, we must endeavour\r\nto sketch in the merest outline the methods of stratigraphical geology.\r\nThe surface of the Earth in some places stands out in the form of bare\r\nmasses of rock, roughly hewn or finely carved by Nature’s tools of\r\nfrost, rain or running water; in other places we have gently undulating\r\nground with beds of rock exposed to view here and there, but for the\r\nmost part covered with loose material such as gravel, sands, boulder\r\nclay and surface soil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GEOLOGICAL SECTIONS.]\r\n\r\nIn the flat lands of the fen districts, the peat beds and low-lying\r\nsalt marshes form the surface features, and are the connecting links\r\nbetween the rock-building now in progress and the deposits of an\r\nearlier age. If we could remove all these surface accumulations of\r\nsand, gravel, peat and surface soil, and take a bird’s eye view of\r\nthe bare surface of the rocky skeleton of the earth’s crust, we\r\nshould have spread before us the outlines of a geological map. In\r\nsome places fairly horizontal beds of rock stretching over a wide\r\nextent of country, in another the upturned edges of almost vertical\r\nstrata form the surface features; or, again, irregular bosses of\r\ncrystalline igneous rock occur here and there as patches in the\r\nmidst of bedded sedimentary or volcanic strata. A map showing the\r\nboundaries and distribution of the rocks as seen at the surface,\r\ntells us comparatively little as to the relative positions of the\r\ndifferent rocks below ground, or of the relative ages of the several\r\nstrata. If we supplement this superficial view by an inspection of\r\nthe position of the strata as shown on the walls of a deep trench cut\r\nacross the country, we at once gain very important information as to\r\nthe relative position of the beds below the earth’s surface. The face\r\nof a quarry, the side of a river bed or a railway cutting, afford\r\nHORIZONTAL SECTIONS or PROFILES which show whether certain strata lie\r\nabove or below others, whether a series of rocks consists of parallel\r\nand regularly stratified beds, or whether the succession of the strata\r\nis interfered with by a greater or less divergence from a parallel\r\narrangement. If, for example, a section shows comparatively horizontal\r\nstrata lying across the worn down edges of a series of vertical\r\nsedimentary rocks, we may fairly assume that some such changes as the\r\nfollowing have taken place in that particular area.\r\n\r\nThe underlying beds were originally laid down as more or less\r\nhorizontal deposits; these were gradually hardened and compacted,\r\nthen elevated above sea-level by a folding of the earth’s crust; the\r\ncrests of the folds were afterwards worn down by denudation, and the\r\neroded surface finally subsided below sea-level and formed the floor\r\non which newer deposits were built up. Such breaks in the continuity\r\nof stratified deposits are known as UNCONFORMITIES; in the interval of\r\ntime which they represent great changes took place of which the records\r\nare either entirely lost, or have to be sought elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn certain more exceptional cases, it is possible to obtain what is\r\ntechnically known as a VERTICAL SECTION; for example if a deep boring\r\nis sunk through a series of rocks, and the core of the boring examined,\r\nwe have as it were a sample of the earth’s crust which may often teach\r\nus valuable lessons which cannot be learnt from maps or horizontal\r\nsections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INVERSION OF STRATA.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, that in a given series of beds, which are either\r\nhorizontal or more or less obliquely inclined, the underlying strata\r\nwere the first formed, and the upper beds were laid down afterwards.\r\nIf, however, we trusted solely to the order of superposition in\r\nestimating relative age, our conclusions would sometimes be very far\r\nfrom the truth. Recent geological investigations have brought to\r\nlight facts well nigh incredible as to the magnitude and extent of\r\nrock-foldings. In regions of great earth-movements, the crust has been\r\nbroken along certain lines, and great masses of strata have been thrust\r\nfor miles along the tops of newer rocks. Thus it may be brought about\r\nthat the natural sequence of a set of beds has been entirely altered,\r\nand older rocks have come to overlie sediments of a later geological\r\nage. Facts such as these clearly illustrate the difficulties of correct\r\ngeological interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn the horizontal section (Fig. 2), from the summit of Büzistock on\r\nthe left to Saasterg on the right, we have a striking case of intense\r\nrock-folding and dislocation[46]. Prof. Heim[47] of Geneva has given\r\nnumerous illustrations of the almost incredible positions assumed\r\nin the Swiss Mountains by vast thicknesses of rocks, and in the\r\naccompanying section taken from a recent work by Rothpletz we have a\r\ncompact example of the possibilities of earth-movements as an agent of\r\nrock-folding. The section illustrates very clearly an exception to the\r\nrule that the order of superposition of a set of beds indicates the\r\nrelative age of the strata. The horizontal line at the base is drawn at\r\na height of 1650 metres above sea-level, and the summit of Büzistock\r\nreaches a height of 2340 m. The youngest rocks seen in the diagram are\r\nthe Eocene beds _e_, at the base and as small isolated patches on the\r\nright-hand end of the section; the main mass of material composing the\r\nhigher ground has been bodily thrust over the Eocene rocks, and in this\r\nprocess some of the beds, _b_ and _c_, have been folded repeatedly on\r\nthemselves. Similar instances of the overthrusting of a considerable\r\nthickness of strata have been described in the North-west Highlands\r\nof Scotland[48] and elsewhere in the British Isles. It is important\r\ntherefore to draw attention to cases of extreme folding, as such\r\nphenomena are by no means exceptional in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Section from Büzistock to Saasterg. [After\r\n  Rothpletz, (94) Pl.

By a careful\r\nexamination of the relics of fossil organisms obtained from rocks\r\nof all ages and countries, it has been found possible to restore in\r\nbroken outline the past history of the Earth. By means, then, of\r\nstratigraphical and palaeontological evidence, a classification of the\r\nvarious rocks has been established, the lines of division being drawn\r\nin such places as represent gaps in the fossil records, or striking and\r\nwidespread unconformities between different series of deposits.\r\n\r\nIt is only in a few regions that we find rocks which can reasonably be\r\nregarded as the foundation stones of the Earth. As the globe gradually\r\ncooled, and its molten mass became skinned over with a solid crust,\r\ncrystalline rocks must have been produced before the dawn of life, and\r\nbefore water could remain in a liquid form on the rocky surface. As\r\nsoon as the temperature became sufficiently low, running water and rain\r\nbegan the work of denudation and rock disintegration which has been\r\nceaselessly carried on ever since. In this continual breaking down and\r\nbuilding up of the Earth’s surface, it would be no wonder if but few\r\nremnants were left of the first formed sediments of the earliest age.\r\n\r\nThe action of heat, pressure and chemical change accompanying\r\nrock-foldings and crust-wrinklings, often so far alters sedimentary\r\ndeposits, that their original form is entirely lost, and sandstone,\r\nshales and limestones become metamorphosed into crystalline quartzites,\r\nslates and marbles.\r\n\r\nThe operation of metamorphism is therefore another serious difficulty\r\nin the way of recognising the oldest rocks. The earliest animals and\r\nplants which have been discovered are not such as we should expect\r\nto find as examples of the first products of organic life. Below the\r\noldest known fossiliferous rocks, there must have been thousands of\r\nfeet of sedimentary material, which has either been altered beyond\r\nrecognition, or from some cause or other does not form part of our\r\npresent geological record.\r\n\r\nAs a general introduction to geological chronology, a short summary\r\nmay be given of the different formations or groups of strata, to which\r\ncertain names have been assigned to serve as convenient designations\r\nfor succeeding epochs in the world’s evolution. The following table\r\n(Fig. 3, pp. 32, 33) represents the geological series in a convenient\r\nform; the most characteristic rocks of each period are indicated by the\r\nusual conventional shading, and the most important breaks or lacunae in\r\nthe records are shown by gaps and uneven lines. The relative thickness\r\nof the rocks of each period is approximately shown; but the vertical\r\nextent of the oldest or Archaean rocks as shown in Fig. 3 represents\r\nwhat is without doubt but a fraction of their proportional thickness.\r\nThis table is taken, with certain alterations, from a paper by Prof.\r\nT. McKenny Hughes in the Cambridge Philosophical Proceedings for 1879.\r\nSpeaking of the graphic method of showing the geological series, the\r\nauthor of the paper says, “It is convenient to have a table of the\r\nknown strata, and although we cannot arrange all the rocks of the\r\nworld in parallel columns, and say that _ABC_ of one area are exactly\r\nsynchronous with _A′B′C′_ of another, still if we take any one country\r\nand establish a grouping for it, we find so many horizons at which\r\nequivalent formations can be identified in distant places, that we\r\ngenerally make an approximation to HOMOTAXIS as Huxley called it. The\r\nmost convenient grouping is obviously to bracket together locally\r\ncontinuous deposits, _i.e._ all the sediment which was formed from the\r\ntime when the land went down and accumulation began, to the time when\r\nthe sea bottom was raised and the work of destruction began. In the\r\naccompanying table I have given the rocks of Great Britain classified\r\non this system, and bearing in mind that waste in one place must be\r\nrepresented by deposit elsewhere, I have represented the periods of\r\ndegradation by intervals estimated where possible by the amount of\r\ndenudation known to have taken place between the periods of deposition\r\nin the same district[49].”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TABLE OF STRATA.\r\n\r\n                  RECENT              ╮\r\n                  GLACIAL             ├ QUATERNARY\r\n                  PLIOCENE            ╯\r\n\r\n                  MIOCENE             ╮\r\n                                      │\r\n                  OLIGOCENE           ├ TERTIARY\r\n                                      │\r\n                  EOCENE              ╯\r\n\r\n                  CRETACEOUS          ╮\r\n                                      │\r\n                  JURASSIC            │\r\n                                      ├ MESOZOIC\r\n                  TRIAS               │\r\n                                      │\r\n                  PERMIAN             ╯\r\n\r\n                ╭ Coal-Measures       ╮\r\n                │                     │\r\n                │ Millstone Grit      │\r\n  CARBONIFEROUS ┤                     │\r\n                │ Yoredale Rocks      │\r\n                │                     │\r\n                ╰ Mountain Limestone  │\r\n                                      │\r\n                ╭  Devonian           │\r\n                │                     │\r\n                │ Upper Old Red       │\r\n  DEVONIAN      ┤   Sandstone         │\r\n                │                     │\r\n                │ Lower Old Red       │\r\n                ╰   Sandstone         │\r\n                                      │\r\n                ╭ Ludlow              │\r\n                │                     │\r\n  SILURIAN      ┤ Wenlock             ├ PALAEOZOIC\r\n                │                     │\r\n                ╰ May Hill            │\r\n                                      │\r\n                ╭ Upper Bala          │\r\n                │                     │\r\n                │ Lower Bala          │\r\n  ORDOVICIAN    ┤                     │\r\n                │ Llandeilo           │\r\n                │                     │\r\n                ╰ Arenig              │\r\n                                      │\r\n                ╭ Tremadoc            │\r\n                │                     │\r\n                │ Lingula Flags       │\r\n  CAMBRIAN      ┤                     │\r\n                │ Menevian            │\r\n                │                     │\r\n                ╰ Harlech             ╯\r\n\r\n                  LAVAS,              ╮\r\n                  VOLCANIC            │\r\n                  ASHES,              │\r\n                  GRANITOID           ├ ARCHAEAN\r\n                  ROCKS AND           │\r\n                  SCHISTS OF          │\r\n                  ENORMOUS            │\r\n                  THICKNESS           ╯\r\n\r\n                    Fig 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            I. =Archaean.=\r\n\r\n  “Men can do nothing without the make-believe of a beginning.”\r\n                                                    GEORGE ELIOT.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no problem at once so difficult and so full of\r\ninterest to the student of the Earth’s history, as the interpretation\r\nof the fragmentary records of the opening stages in geological and\r\norganic evolution. In tracing the growth and development of the human\r\nrace, it becomes increasingly difficult to discover and decipher\r\nwritten documents as we penetrate farther back towards the beginning\r\nof the historical period; the records are usually incomplete and\r\nfragmentary, or rendered illegible by the superposed writings of a\r\nlater date. So in the records of the rocks, as we pass beyond the\r\noldest strata in which clearly preserved fossils are met with, we come\r\nto older rocks which afford either no data as to the period in which\r\nthey were formed, or like the palimpsest, with its original characters\r\nalmost obliterated by a late MS., the older portions of the Earth’s\r\ncrust have been used and re-used in the rock-building of later ages.\r\nIn the first place, it is exceedingly difficult to determine with any\r\ncertainty what rocks may be regarded as trustworthy fragments of a\r\nprimaeval land. Throughout the geological eras the Earth’s surface\r\nhas been subjected to foldings and wrinklings, volcanic activity has\r\nbeen almost unceasing, and there is abundant evidence to show how\r\nthe original characters of both igneous and sedimentary rocks may be\r\nentirely effaced by the operation of chemical and physical forces. It\r\nwas formerly held that coarsely crystalline rocks such as granite are\r\nthe oldest portions of the crust, but modern geology has conclusively\r\nproved that many of the so-called fundamental masses of rock are merely\r\npiles of ancient sediments which have been subjected to the repeated\r\noperation of powerful physical and chemical forces, and have undergone\r\na complete rearrangement of their substance. As the result of more\r\ndetailed investigations, many regions formerly supposed to consist of\r\nthe foundation stones of the Earth’s crust, are now known to have been\r\ncentres of volcanic disturbance and widespread metamorphism, and to be\r\nmade up of post-archaean rocks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE OLDEST ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nThe first formed rocks no doubt became at once the prey of denudation\r\nand disintegration, and on their surface would be accumulated the\r\nproducts of their own destruction: newer strata would entirely cover up\r\nportions of the original land, to be in their turn succeeded by still\r\nlater deposits. There is reason to believe that in the remotest ages of\r\nthe Earth’s history, the forces of denudation and igneous activity were\r\nmore potent than in later times, and thus the oldest rocks could hardly\r\nretain their original structure through the long ages of geologic time.\r\nThe earliest representatives of organic life were doubtless of such\r\na perishable nature that their remains could not be preserved in a\r\nfossil state even under the most favourable conditions. Such organisms,\r\nwhether plants or animals, as possessed any resistant tissues or hard\r\nskeletons might be preserved in the oldest rocks, but as these strata\r\nbecame involved in earth-foldings or were penetrated by injections of\r\nigneous eruptions, the relics of life would be entirely destroyed.\r\nIt is, in short, practically hopeless to look for any fragments of\r\nthe primitive crust except such as have undergone very considerable\r\nmetamorphism, and equally futile to search for any recognisable remains\r\nof primitive life.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world vast thicknesses of rock occur below the\r\noldest known fossiliferous strata; these consist largely of laminated\r\ncrystalline masses composed of quartz, felspar, and other minerals,\r\nhaving in fact the same composition as granite, but differing in the\r\nregular arrangement of the constituent parts. To such rocks the terms\r\ngneiss and schist have been applied. Rocks of this kind are by no means\r\nalways of Archaean age, but many of the earliest known rocks consist of\r\ngneisses of various kinds, associated with altered lavas, metamorphosed\r\nashes, breccias and other products of volcanic activity; with these\r\nthere may be limestones, shales, sandstones, and other strata more or\r\nless closely resembling sedimentary deposits. Such a succession of\r\ngneissic rocks has been described as occupying a wide area in the basin\r\nof the St Lawrence river, and to these enormously thick and widespread\r\nmasses a late Director of the Canadian Geological Survey applied\r\nthe term Laurentian. These Laurentian rocks, with similar strata in\r\nScandinavia, the north-west Highlands of Scotland, in certain parts of\r\nsuch mountain ranges as the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, Himalayas,\r\nAndes, Atlas, &c., have been classed together as members of the oldest\r\ngeological period, and are usually referred to under the name of\r\nArchaean, or less frequently Azoic rocks. In some of the uppermost\r\nArchaean rocks there have been recently discovered a few undoubted\r\ntraces of fossil animals, but with this exception no fossils are known\r\nthroughout the great mass of Archaean strata. It is true that some\r\nauthorities regard the beds of graphite and other rocks as a proof of\r\nthe abundance of plant life, but this supposition is not supported by\r\nany convincing evidence.\r\n\r\nThe term Azoic[50] applied by some writers to these oldest rocks\r\nsuggests the absence of life during the period in which they were\r\nformed. Life there must have been, though we are unable to discover its\r\nrecords. The period of time represented by the Archaean or Pre-Cambrian\r\nrocks must be enormous, and it was in that earliest era that the first\r\nlinks in the chain of life were forged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            II. =Cambrian.=\r\n\r\nThe term Cambrian was adopted by Sedgwick for a series of sedimentary\r\nrocks in North Wales (_Cambria_). In that district, in South Wales,\r\nthe Longmynd Hills, the Malverns, in Scotland, and other regions\r\nthere occur more or less highly folded and contorted beds of pebbly\r\nconglomerate, sandstones, shales and slates resting on the uneven\r\nsurface of an Archaean foundation.\r\n\r\nIt is in these Cambrian rocks that trustworthy records of organic life\r\nare first met with. Among the most constant and characteristic fossils\r\nof this period are the extinct and aberrant members of the crustacea,\r\nthe trilobites; these with some brachiopods, sponges, and other fossils\r\ncomprise the oldest fauna, of which the ancestral types have yet to\r\nbe discovered. During the last few decades the number of Cambrian\r\nfossils has been considerably increased, and in certain regions of\r\nNorth America and China there are found many thousand feet of strata\r\nabove the typical Archaean rocks and below the newer fossiliferous beds\r\nof Cambrian age. It is reasonable to suppose that future research may\r\nextend the present limits of fossil-bearing rocks below the horizon,\r\nwhich is marked by the occurrence of the widely distributed and oldest\r\nknown trilobite, the genus _Olenellus_.\r\n\r\nThe vast thickness of Cambrian strata was for the most part laid down\r\non the floor of a comparatively deep sea; other members of the series\r\nrepresent the shingle beaches and coast deposits accumulated on the\r\nslopes of Archaean islands. There have been many conjectures as to the\r\ndistribution of land and sea during the deposition of these rocks; but\r\nthe data are too imperfect to enable us to restore with any degree\r\nof confidence the physical geography of this Palaeozoic epoch, of\r\nwhich the sediments stood out as islands of Cambrian land during many\r\nsucceeding ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          III. =Ordovician.=\r\n\r\nSince the days when Sedgwick and Murchison first worked out the\r\nsuccession of Palaeozoic strata in North Wales, there has always\r\nexisted a considerable difference of opinion as to the best method of\r\nsubdividing the Cambrian-Silurian strata. Later research has shown\r\nthat the rocks included by Sedgwick in his Cambrian system, fall\r\nnaturally into two groups; for the upper of these Prof. Lapworth has\r\nsuggested the term Ordovician, from the name of the Ordovices, who\r\ninhabited a part of northern Wales. At the base of the system we have\r\na series of volcanic and sedimentary rocks to which Sedgwick gave the\r\nname Arenig; above these there occur the Llandeilo Flags, succeeded\r\nby a considerable thickness of rocks known as the Bala series. The\r\nrocks making up these Ordovician sediments consist for the most part\r\nof slates, sandstones and limestones with volcanic ashes and lavas.\r\nMuch of the typical Welsh scenery owes its character to the folded and\r\nweathered rocks laid down on the floor of the Ordovician sea, on which\r\nfrom many centres of volcanic activity lava streams and showers of ash\r\nwere spread out between sheets of marine sediment. The Arenig Hills,\r\nSnowdonia, and many other parts of North and South Wales, parts of\r\nShropshire, Scotland, Sweden, Russia, Bohemia, North America and other\r\nregions consist of great thicknesses of Ordovician strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            IV. =Silurian.=\r\n\r\nPassing up a stage higher in the geologic series, we have a succession\r\nof conglomerates, sandstones, shales, and limestones; in other words,\r\na series of beds which represent pebbly shore deposits, the sands\r\nand muds of deeper water, and the accumulated débris of calcareous\r\nskeletons of animals which lived in the clear water of the Silurian\r\nsea. The term Silurian (Siluria was the country of Caractacus and the\r\nold Britons known as Silures[51]) was first applied by Murchison in\r\n1835 to a more comprehensive series of rocks than are now included\r\nin the Silurian system. The rocks of this period occur in Wales,\r\nShropshire, parts of Scotland, Ireland, Scandinavia, Russia, the\r\nUnited States and other countries. After the accumulation of the\r\nthick Ordovician sediments, the sea-floor was upraised and in places\r\nconverted into ridges or islands of land, of which the detritus formed\r\npart of the material of Silurian deposits. The limestones of the\r\nWenlock ridge have yielded an abundant fauna, consisting of corals,\r\ncrinoids, molluscs and other invertebrates. In this period we have the\r\nfirst representatives of the Vertebrata, discovered in the rocks of\r\nLudlow. In fact, in the Silurian period, “all the great divisions of\r\nthe Animal Kingdom were already represented[52].”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            V. =Devonian.=\r\n\r\nBy the continued elevation of the Silurian sea-floor, large portions\r\nbecame dry land, and during the succeeding period most of the British\r\narea formed part of a continental mass. Over the southern part of\r\nEngland, there still lay an arm of the sea, and in this were laid\r\ndown the marine sediments which now form part of Devon, and from\r\nwhich the name Devonian has been taken as a convenient designation\r\nfor the strata of this period. In parts of the northern land, in the\r\nregion now occupied by Scotland, there were large inland lakes, on\r\nthe floor of which vast thicknesses of shingle beds and coarse sands\r\n(“Old Red Sandstone”) were slowly accumulated; and it has been shown\r\nby Sir Archibald Geikie and others that during this epoch there were\r\nconsiderable outpourings of volcanic material in the Scotch area.\r\n\r\nFarther to the West and South-west there was another large lake in\r\nwhich the so-called Kiltorkan beds of Ireland were deposited. In these\r\nIrish sediments, and others of the same age in Belgium and elsewhere\r\na few forms of land plants have been discovered; but it is from the\r\nDevonian rocks of North America that most of our knowledge of the flora\r\nof this period has been obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VI. =Carboniferous.=\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of palaeobotany, the shales, sandstones, and\r\nseams of coal included in the Carboniferous system are of special\r\ninterest. It is from the relics of this Palaeozoic vegetation that the\r\nmost important botanical lessons have been learnt.\r\n\r\nThe following classification of Carboniferous rocks shows the order of\r\nsuccession of the various beds, and the nature of the rocks which were\r\nformed at this stage in the Earth’s history.\r\n\r\n                                    ╭ Upper Coal-Measures.\r\n                ╭ Coal-Measures[53] ┤ Transition Series.\r\n                │                   │ Middle Coal-Measures.\r\n                │                   ╰ Lower Coal-Measures.\r\n                │ Millstone Grit.\r\n  CARBONIFEROUS ┤                         ╭ Upper limestone shales\r\n                │                         │     and Yoredale rocks.\r\n                │ Carboniferous limestone ┤ Carboniferous or\r\n                │     series              │     Mountain limestone.\r\n                │                         ╰ Lower limestone shales.\r\n                ╰ Basement conglomerate.\r\n\r\nIn the classification of Carboniferous rocks adopted in Geikie’s\r\ntext-book of Geology the following arrangement is followed for the\r\nCarboniferous limestone series[54]:—\r\n\r\n                      ╭ _Yoredale group_ of shales and grits passing\r\n                      │   down into dark shales and limestones.\r\n                      │ _Thick (Scaur or Main) limestone_ in the\r\n                      │   south and centre of England and Ireland,\r\n                      │   passing northwards into sandstones,\r\n                      │   shales and coals with limestones.\r\n  Carboniferous       ┤ _Lower limestone shale_ of the south and\r\n    limestone series  │   centre of England.

These were\r\neventually succeeded by less pure calcareous deposits, the sea became\r\nshallower, and land detritus found its way over an area formerly\r\noccupied by the clear waters of an open sea. The shallowing process\r\nwas gradually continued, and the sea was by some means converted into\r\na more confined fresh-water or brackish area, in which were laid down\r\nmany hundred feet of coarse sandy sediments derived from the waste\r\nof granitic highlands. Finally the conditions became less constant;\r\nthe continuous deposition of sandy detritus being interrupted by the\r\nmore or less complete filling up of the area of sedimentation, and the\r\nformation of a land surface which supported a luxuriant vegetation,\r\nof which the débris was subsequently converted into beds of coal. By\r\nfurther subsidence the land was again submerged, and the forest-covered\r\narea became overspread with sands and muds.\r\n\r\nSuch are the imperfect outlines of the general physical conditions\r\nwhich are represented by the series of sedimentary strata included in\r\nthe Carboniferous system. At the close of this period, the Earth’s\r\nsurface in Western Europe was subjected to crust-foldings on a large\r\nscale, along lines running approximately North and South and East and\r\nWest, the two sets of movements resulting in the formation of ridges\r\nof Carboniferous rocks. The uppermost series of grits, sandstones and\r\ncoal-seams were in great part removed by denudation from the crests\r\nof the elevated ridges, but remained in the intervening troughs or\r\nbasins where they were less exposed to denudation. It is the direct\r\nconsequence of this, that we have our Coal-Measures preserved in the\r\nform of detached basins of upper Carboniferous beds.\r\n\r\nA closer examination of the comparative thickness and succession of\r\nCarboniferous rocks in different parts of Britain shows very clearly\r\nthat in the northern area of Scotland and in the North of England the\r\nconditions were different from those which obtained further South.\r\nSeeing how much palaeobotanical interest attaches to these rocks, it is\r\nimportant to treat a little more fully of their geology.\r\n\r\nIn parts of Devon, Cornwall and West Somerset, the Devonian strata\r\nare succeeded by a series of folded and contorted rocks which have\r\nyielded a comparatively small number of Carboniferous fossils. To this\r\nsuccession of limestones, shales and grits the term _Culm-Measures_ was\r\napplied by Sedgwick and Murchison in 1837. The rocks of this series\r\noccupy a trough between the Devonian rocks of North and South Devon.\r\nWhile some authorities have correlated the Culm-Measures with the\r\nMillstone Grit, others regard them as representing a portion of the\r\ntrue Coal-Measures, as well as the Carboniferous and Lower Limestone\r\nShale[55]. It has recently been shown that among the lower Culm strata\r\nthere occur bands of ancient deep-sea sediments, consisting of beds\r\nof chert containing siliceous casts of various species of Radiolaria.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the discovery of deep-sea fossils in this\r\nparticular development of the British Carboniferous system leads to\r\nthe conclusion that “while the massive deposits of the Carboniferous\r\nlimestone—formed of the skeletons of calcareous organisms—were in\r\nprocess of growth in the seas to the North, there existed to the\r\nSouth-west a deeper ocean in which siliceous organisms predominated and\r\nformed these siliceous radiolarian rocks[56].”\r\n\r\nThe Upper Culm-Measures consist of conglomerates, grits, sandstones\r\nand shales with some plant remains and other fossils, and constitute a\r\ntypical set of shallow water sediments. In Westphalia, the Harz region,\r\nThuringia, Silesia and Moravia there are rocks corresponding to the\r\nCulm-Measures of Devon, and some of these have also afforded evidence\r\nof deep water conditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COAL-MEASURES.]\r\n\r\n_S. W. England, S. Wales, Derbyshire and Yorkshire._ In these districts\r\nthe Carboniferous limestone reaches a considerable thickness; in the\r\nMendips it has a thickness of 3000 feet, and in the Pennine chain of\r\n4000 feet. At the base of this limestone series there occurs in the\r\nsouthern districts the so-called lower limestone shale, consisting of\r\nclays, shales and sandy beds. Above the limestone we have the Millstone\r\ngrit and Coal-Measures; but in the Pennine district there is a series\r\nof rocks consisting of impure limestones and shales, intercalated\r\nbetween the Millstone grit and Carboniferous limestone; for this group\r\nof rocks the term _Yoredale series_ has been proposed. In the Isle of\r\nMan and Derbyshire sheets of lava are interbedded with the calcareous\r\nsediments, affording clear proof of submarine volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\n_N. England and Scotland._ In the Carboniferous rocks of Northumberland\r\nwe have distinct indications of a shallower sea. The regular succession\r\nof limestone strata in West Yorkshire and other districts, gives place\r\nto a series of thinner beds of limestones, interstratified with shales\r\nand impure calcareous rocks. We have come within the range of land\r\ndetritus which was spread out on the floor of a shallow sea. The lowest\r\nportion of the Mountain limestone is here represented by about 200 feet\r\nof shales and other rocks grouped together in the _Tuedian series_.\r\nThe Upper Carboniferous limestone and Yoredale rocks of Yorkshire are\r\nrepresented by sandstones, carbonaceous limestones and some seams of\r\ncoal, included in the _Bernician series_. Further north, again, another\r\nclassification has been proposed for the still more aberrant succession\r\nof rocks; the lowest being spoken of as the _Calciferous sandstone_,\r\nand the upper as the _Carboniferous limestone_. The calciferous\r\nsandstone may be compared with the lower limestone shale and part of\r\nthe Carboniferous limestone of England. The Carboniferous limestone of\r\nScotland probably represents the upper part of the limestone of England\r\nand the Yoredale rocks of the Pennine and other areas.\r\n\r\nTurning to the upper members of the Carboniferous system—in the\r\nCoal-Measures, as they were called in 1817 by William Smith,—we have a\r\nseries of coal seams, sandstones, shales, and ironstones occurring for\r\nthe most part in basin-shaped areas. As a general rule, each seam of\r\ncoal, which varies in thickness from one inch to thirty feet, rests on\r\na characteristic unstratified argillaceous rock known as Underclay.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (Fig. 4) illustrates the frequent\r\nintercalation of small bands of argillaceous and sandy rocks associated\r\nwith the seams of coal.\r\n\r\nThe usual classification adopted for the British Coal-Measures is that\r\nof Upper, Middle, and Lower Coal-Measures; between the Upper and Middle\r\ndivisions there occur certain transition or passage beds which are\r\nknown as the Transition series. Continental writers, and more recently\r\nMr Kidston of Stirling, have attempted with considerable success to\r\ncorrelate the Coal-producing strata by means of fossil plants[57].\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  10 in.

In a geological map, or bird’s-eye\r\nview of a country, we see such rocks as appear at the surface; by\r\nmeans of deep borings, however, we are occasionally enabled to follow\r\nthe course of older beds a considerable distance below the usually\r\naccessible part of the Earth’s crust. In the neighbourhood of London,\r\nDover, and other places we have Tertiary and Mesozoic strata forming\r\nthe surface of the country, but below these comparatively recent\r\nformations, the sinking of deep wells and other borings have proved\r\nthe existence of a ridge of Palaeozoic rocks stretching from the South\r\nWales Coal-field through the South-east of England to northern France,\r\nBelgium and Westphalia. It is from rocks forming part of this old\r\nridge that characteristic Coal-Measure plants have been obtained from\r\nthe Dover boring. In Fig. 5 is shown an almost complete pinnule of\r\n_Neuropteris Scheuchzeri_ Hoffm., a well-known fern, marking a definite\r\nhorizon of Upper Carboniferous rocks[58]. The small hairs on the\r\npinnules, shown in the figure as fine lines lying more or less parallel\r\nto the midrib and across the lateral veins, are a characteristic\r\nfeature of this species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.\r\n\r\n  Imperfect pinnule of _Neuropteris Scheuchzeri_ Hoffm., showing the\r\n  characteristic hairs as fine lines traversing the lateral veins.\r\n  From a specimen obtained from the Dover boring and now in the\r\n  British Museum. Nat. size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VII. =Permian.=\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the earth-foldings which marked\r\nthe close of Carboniferous times; “the open Mediterranean sea of the\r\nCarboniferous period in Europe was converted into a large inland sea,\r\nlike the Caspian of the present day, surrounded by a rocky and hilly\r\ncontinent, on which grew trees and plants of various kinds[59].” In\r\nparts of\r\n\r\nLancashire, Westmoreland, the Eden Valley, and in the East of England\r\nfrom Sunderland to Nottingham, there occurs a succession of limestones,\r\nsandstones, clays and other rocks with occasional beds of rock-salt\r\nand gypsum, which represent the various forms of sediment and chemical\r\nprecipitates formed on the floor of Permian lakes. The poverty of the\r\nfauna and flora of Permian strata points to conditions unfavourable to\r\nlife; and there can be little doubt that the characteristic red rocks\r\nof St Bees Head, and the creamy limestones of the Durham coast are the\r\nupraised sediments of an inland salt-water lake. The term Dyas was\r\nproposed by Marcou for this series of strata as represented in Germany,\r\nwhere the rocks are conveniently grouped in two series, the _Magnesian\r\nlimestone_ or _Zechstein_ and the red sandstones or _Rothliegendes_.\r\nThe older and better known name of Permian was instituted by Murchison\r\nfor the rocks of this age, from their extreme development in the old\r\nkingdom of Permia in Russia. Unfortunately considerable confusion has\r\narisen from the employment of different names for rocks of the same\r\ngeological period; and the grouping of the beds varies in different\r\nparts of the world. It is of interest to note, that in the Tyrol,\r\nCarinthia, and other places there are found patches of old marine beds\r\nwhich were originally laid down in an open sea, which extended over\r\nthe site of the Mediterranean, into Russia and Asia. In Bohemia, the\r\nHarz district, Autun in Burgundy, and other regions, there are seams\r\nof Permian coal interstratified with the marls and sands. From these\r\nlast named beds many fossil plants have been obtained, and important\r\npalaeobotanical facts brought to light by the investigations of\r\ncontinental workers. Volcanic eruptions, accompanied by lava streams\r\nand showers of ash, have been recognised in the Permian rocks of\r\nScotland, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn North America, Australia, and India the term Permo-Carboniferous is\r\noften made use of in reference to the continuous and regular sequence\r\nof beds which were formed towards the close of the Carboniferous and\r\ninto the succeeding Permian epoch. The enormous series of freshwater\r\nIndian rocks, to which geologists have given the name of the GONDWANA\r\nSYSTEM, includes the sediments of more than one geological period,\r\nsome of the older members being regarded as Permo-Carboniferous in\r\nage. These Indian beds, with others in Australia, South Africa, and\r\nSouth America, are of special interest on account of the characteristic\r\nsouthern hemisphere plants which they have afforded, and from the\r\nassociation with the fossiliferous strata of extensive boulder beds\r\npointing to widespread glacial conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VIII. =Trias.=\r\n\r\nAs we ascend the geologic series, and pass up to the rocks overlying\r\nthe Permian deposits, there are found many indications of a marked\r\nchange in the records of animal and plant life. Many of the\r\ncharacteristic Palaeozoic fossils are no longer represented, and\r\nin their place we meet with fresh and in many cases more highly\r\ndifferentiated organisms. The threefold division of the rocks of this\r\nperiod which suggested the term Trias to those who first worked out the\r\nsuccession of the strata, is typically illustrated over a wide area\r\nin Germany, in which the lowest or _Bunter_ series is followed by the\r\ncalcareous _Muschelkalk_, and this again by the clays, rock-salt, and\r\nsandstones of the _Keuper_ series. In the Cheshire plain and in the\r\nlow ground of the Midlands, we have a succession of red sandstones,\r\nconglomerates, and layers of rock-salt which correspond to the Bunter\r\nand Keuper beds of German geologists. These Triassic rocks were\r\nobviously formed in salt-water lakes, in which from time to time long\r\ncontinued evaporation gave rise to extensive deposit of rock-salt\r\nand other minerals. From the fact that it is this type of Triassic\r\nsediments which was first made known, it is often forgotten that the\r\nBritish and German rocks are not the typical representatives of this\r\ngeological period. The ‘Alpine’ Trias of the Mediterranean region,\r\nin Asia, North America, and other countries, has a totally different\r\nfacies, and includes limestones and dolomites of deep-sea origin. “The\r\nwidespread Alpine Trias is the pelagic facies of the formation; the\r\nmore restricted German Trias, on the other hand, is a shallow shore,\r\nbay or inland sea formation[60].”\r\n\r\nIn the Keuper beds of southern Sweden there are found workable\r\nseams of coal, and the beds of this district have yielded numerous\r\nwell-preserved examples of the Triassic flora. A more impure coal\r\noccurs in the lower Keuper of Thuringia and S.-W. Germany, and to this\r\ngroup of rocks the term _Lettenkohle_ is occasionally applied.\r\n\r\nIn the Rhaetic Alps of Lombardy, in the Tyrol, and in England, from\r\nYorkshire to Lyme Regis, Devonshire, Somersetshire, and other districts\r\nthere are certain strata at the top of the Triassic system known as\r\nthe _Rhaetic_ or _Penarth_ beds. The uppermost Rhaetic beds, often\r\ndescribed as the White Lias, afford evidence of a change from the salt\r\nlakes of the Trias to the open sea of the succeeding Jurassic period.\r\nPassing beyond this period of salt lakes and wind-swept barren tracts\r\nof land, we enter on another phase of the earth’s history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            IX. =Jurassic.=\r\n\r\nThe Jura mountains of western Switzerland consist in great part of\r\nfolded and contorted rocks which were originally deposited on the\r\nfloor of a Jurassic sea. In England the Jurassic rocks are of special\r\ninterest, both for geological and historical reasons, as it is in them\r\nthat we find a rich fauna and flora of Mesozoic age, and it was the\r\nclassification of these beds by means of their fossil contents that\r\ngained for William Smith the title of the Father of English Geology. A\r\nglance at a geological map of England shows a band of Jurassic rocks\r\nstretching across from the Yorkshire coast to Dorset. These are in a\r\nlarge measure calcareous, argillaceous, and arenaceous sediments of an\r\nopen sea; but towards the upper limit of the series, both freshwater\r\nand terrestrial beds are met with. Numerous fragments of old coral\r\nreefs, sea-urchins, crinoids, and other marine fossils are especially\r\nabundant; in the freshwater beds and old surface-soils, as well as in\r\nthe marine sandstones and shales, we have remnants of an exceedingly\r\nrich and apparently tropical vegetation. This was an age of Reptiles\r\nas well as an age of Cycads. An interesting feature of these widely\r\ndistributed Jurassic strata is the evidence they afford of distinct\r\nclimatal zones; there are clear indications, according to the late Dr\r\nNeumayr, of a Mediterranean, a middle European, and a Boreal or Russian\r\nprovince[61]. The subdivisions of the English Jurassic rocks are as\r\nfollows[62]:—\r\n\r\n           ╭ ╭ Purbeck beds           ╮          ╮\r\n           │ │ Portland beds          ├ _Upper_  │\r\n           │ │ Kimeridge clay         ╯          │\r\n           │ ┤                                   │\r\n           │ │ Corallian beds         ╮          │\r\n  JURASSIC ┤ │ Oxford clay, with      ├ _Middle_ ├ Oolite.\r\n           │ ╰   Kellaways rock       ╯          │\r\n           │                                     │\r\n           │ ╭ Great Oolite series    ╮ _Lower_  │\r\n           │ ╰ Inferior Oolite series ╯          ╯\r\n           │\r\n           ╰ Lias\r\n\r\nIn tracing the several groups across England, and into other parts of\r\nEurope, their characters are naturally found to vary considerably; in\r\none area a series is made up of typical clear water or comparatively\r\ndeep sea sediments, and in another we have shallow water and shore\r\ndeposits of the same age. The Lias rocks have been further subdivided\r\ninto zones by means of the species of Ammonites which form so\r\ncharacteristic a feature of the Jurassic fauna. In the lower Oolite\r\nstrata there are shelly limestones, clays, sandstones, and beds of\r\nlignite and ironstone. Without discussing the other subdivisions of\r\nthe Jurassic period, we may note that in the uppermost members there\r\nare preserved patches of old surface-soils exposed in the face of the\r\ncliffs of the Dorset coast and of the Isle of Portland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           X. =Cretaceous.=\r\n\r\nIn the south of England, and in some other districts, it is difficult\r\nto draw any definite line between the uppermost strata of the Jurassic\r\nand the lowest of the Cretaceous period. The rocks of the so-called\r\n_Wealden_ series of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and the Isle of Wight, are\r\nusually classed as Lower Cretaceous, but there is strong evidence\r\nin favour of regarding them as sediments of the Jurassic period.\r\nThe Cretaceous rocks of England are generally speaking parallel to\r\nthe Jurassic strata, and occupy a stretch of country from the east\r\nof Yorkshire and the Norfolk coast to Dorset in the south-west. The\r\nChalk downs and cliffs represent the most familiar type of Cretaceous\r\nstrata. In the white chalk with its numerous flints, we have part\r\nof the elevated floor of a comparatively deep sea, which extended\r\nin Cretaceous times over a large portion of the east and south-east\r\nof England and other portions of the European continent. On the bed\r\nof this sea, beyond the reach of any river-borne detritus, there\r\naccumulated through long ages the calcareous and siliceous remains of\r\nmarine animals, to be afterwards converted into chalk and flints. At\r\nthe beginning of the period, however, other conditions obtained, and\r\nthere extended over the south-east of England, and parts of north and\r\nnorth-west Germany and Belgium, a lake or estuary in which were built\r\nup deposits of clay, sand and other material, forming the delta of\r\none or more large rivers. For these sediments the name _Wealden_ was\r\nsuggested in 1828. Eventually the gradual subsidence of this area led\r\nto an incursion of the sea, and the delta became overflowed by the\r\nwaters of a large Cretaceous sea. At first the sea was shallow, and in\r\nit were laid down coarse sands and other sediments known as the _Lower\r\nGreensand_ rocks. By degrees, as the subsidence continued, the shallows\r\nbecame deep water, and calcareous material slowly accumulated, to be\r\nat last upraised as beds of white chalk. The distribution of fossils\r\nin the Cretaceous rocks of north and south Europe distinctly points to\r\nthe existence of two fairly well-marked sets of organisms in the two\r\nregions; no doubt the expression of climatal zones similar to those\r\nrecognised in Jurassic times. In North America, Cretaceous rocks are\r\nspread over a wide area, also in North Africa, India, South Africa,\r\nand other parts of the world. Within the Arctic Circle strata of this\r\nage have become famous, chiefly on account of the rich flora described\r\nfrom them by the Swiss palaeobotanist Heer. The fauna and flora of this\r\nepoch are alike in their advanced state of development and in the great\r\nvariety of specific types; the highest class of plants is first met\r\nwith at the base of the Cretaceous system.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            XI. =Tertiary.=\r\n\r\n“At the close of the Chalk age a change took place both in the\r\ndistribution of land and water, and also in the development of organic\r\nlife, so great and universal, that it has scarcely been equalled at\r\nany other period of the earth’s geological history[63].” The Tertiary\r\nperiod seems to bring us suddenly to the threshold of our own times. In\r\nEngland at least, the deposits of this age are of the nature of loose\r\nsands, clays and other materials containing shells, bones, and fossil\r\nplants bearing a close resemblance to organisms of the present era.\r\nThe chalk rocks, upheaved from the Cretaceous sea, stood out as dry\r\nland over a large part of Britain; much of their material was in time\r\nremoved by the action of denuding agents, and the rest gradually sank\r\nagain beneath the waters of Tertiary lakes and estuaries. In the south\r\nof England, and in north Europe generally, the Tertiary rocks have\r\nsuffered but little disturbance or folding, but in southern Europe and\r\nother parts of the world, the Tertiary sands have been compacted and\r\nhardened into sandstones, and involved in the gigantic crust-movements\r\nwhich gave birth to many of our highest mountain chains. The Alps,\r\nCarpathians, Apennines, Himalayas, and other ranges consist to a\r\nlarge extent of piled up and strangely folded layers of old Tertiary\r\nsediments. The volcanic activity of this age was responsible for the\r\nbasaltic lavas of the Giants’ Causeway, the Isle of Staffa, and other\r\nparts of western Scotland.\r\n\r\nDuring the succeeding phases of this period, the distribution of land\r\nand sea was continually changing, climatic conditions varied within\r\nwide limits; and in short wherever Tertiary fossiliferous beds occur,\r\nwe find distinct evidence of an age characterised by striking activity\r\nboth as regards the action of dynamical as well as of organic forces.\r\nSir Charles Lyell proposed a subdivision of the strata of this period\r\ninto Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene, founding his classification on the\r\npercentage of recent species of molluscs contained in the various sets\r\nof rocks. His divisions have been generally adopted. In 1854 Prof.\r\nBeyrich proposed to include another subdivision in the Tertiary system,\r\nand to this he gave the name _Oligocene_.\r\n\r\nOccupying a basin-shaped area around London and Paris there are beds of\r\nEocene sands and clays which were originally deposited as continuous\r\nsheets of sediment in water at first salt, afterwards brackish and\r\nto a certain extent fresh. In the Hampshire cliffs and in some parts\r\nof the Isle of Wight, we have other patches of these oldest Tertiary\r\nsediments. Across the south of Europe, North Africa, Arabia, Persia,\r\nthe Himalayas, to Java and the Philippine islands, there existed in\r\nearly Tertiary times a wide sea connecting the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans; and it may be that in the Mediterranean of to-day we have a\r\nremnant of this large Eocene ocean. Later in the Tertiary period a\r\nsimilar series of beds was deposited which we now refer to as the\r\nOligocene strata; such occurs in the cliffs of Headon hill in the Isle\r\nof Wight, containing bones of crocodiles, and turtles, with the relics\r\nof a rich flora preserved in the delta deposits of an Oligocene river.\r\nAt a still later stage the British area was probably dry land, and an\r\nopen sea existed over the Mediterranean region. In the neighbourhood\r\nof Vienna we have beds of this age represented by a succession of\r\nsediments, at first marine and afterwards freshwater. Miocene beds\r\noccur over a considerable area in Switzerland and the Arctic regions,\r\nand they have yielded a rich harvest to palaeobotanical investigators.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, the south of Cornwall, and\r\nother districts there occur beds of shelly sand and gravel long known\r\nunder the name of ‘Crag.’ The beds have a very modern aspect; the\r\nsands have not been converted into sandstones, and the shells have\r\nundergone but little change. These materials were for the most part\r\naccumulated on the bed of a shallow sea which swept over a portion of\r\nEast Anglia in Pliocene times. In the sediments of this age northern\r\nforms of shells and other organisms make their appearance, and in the\r\nCromer forest-bed there occur portions of drifted trees with sands,\r\nclays and gravels, representing in all probability the débris thrown\r\ndown on the banks of an ancient river. At this time the greater part\r\nof the North Sea was probably a low-lying forest-covered region,\r\nthrough which flowed the waters of a large river, of which part still\r\nexists in the modern Rhine. The lowering of temperature which became\r\ndistinctly pronounced in the Pliocene age, continued until the greater\r\npart of Britain and north Europe experienced a glacial period, and such\r\nconditions obtained as we find to-day in ice-covered Greenland. Finally\r\nthe ice-sheet melted, the local glaciers of North Wales, the English\r\nLake district and other hilly regions, retreated, and after repeated\r\nalterations in level, the land of Great Britain assumed its modern\r\nform. The submerged forests and peat beds familiar in many parts of the\r\ncoast, the diatomaceous deposits of dried up lakes, “remain as the very\r\nfinger touches of the last geological change.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GEOLOGICAL EVOLUTION.]\r\n\r\nThe agents of change and geological evolution, which we have passed in\r\nbrief review, are still constantly at work carrying one step further\r\nthe history of the earth. A superficial review of geological history\r\ngives us an impression of recurring and widespread convulsions,\r\nand rapidly effected revolutions in organic life and geographical\r\nconditions; on the other hand a closer comparison of the past and\r\npresent, with due allowance for the enormous period of time represented\r\nby the records of the rocks, helps us to realise the continuity of\r\ngeological evolution. “So that within the whole of the immense period\r\nindicated by the fossiliferous stratified rocks, there is assuredly\r\nnot the slightest proof of any break in the uniformity of Nature’s\r\noperations, no indication that events have followed other than a clear\r\nand orderly sequence[64].”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                THE PRESERVATION OF PLANTS AS FOSSILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare,\r\n     But wonder how the devil they got there.”\r\n                            POPE, _Prologue to the Satires_.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a fossil, whether as an impression on the surface of a\r\nslab of rock or as a piece of petrified wood, naturally leads us back\r\nto the living plant, and invites speculation as to the circumstances\r\nwhich led to the preservation of the plant fragment. There is a certain\r\nfascination in endeavouring, with more or less success, to picture\r\nthe exact conditions which obtained when the leaf or stem was carried\r\nalong by running water and finally sealed up in a sedimentary matrix.\r\nAttempts to answer the question—How came the plant remains to be\r\npreserved as fossils?—are not merely of abstract interest appealing\r\nto the imagination, but are of considerable importance in the correct\r\ninterpretation of the facts which are to be gleaned from the records of\r\nplant-bearing strata.\r\n\r\nBefore describing any specific examples of the commoner methods of\r\nfossilisation; we shall do well to briefly consider how plants are\r\nnow supplying material for the fossils of a future age. In the great\r\nmajority of cases, an appreciation of the conditions of sedimentation,\r\nand of the varied circumstances attending the transport and\r\naccumulation of vegetable débris, supplies the solution of a problem\r\nakin to that of the fly in amber and the manner in which it came there.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OLD SURFACE-SOILS.]\r\n\r\nSeeing that the greater part of the sedimentary strata have been formed\r\nin the sea, and as the sea rather than the land has been for the most\r\npart the scene of rock-building in the past, it is not surprising\r\nthat fossil plants are far less numerous than fossil animals. With\r\nthe exception of the algae and a few representatives of other classes\r\nof plants, which live in the shallow-water belt round the coast,\r\nor in inland lakes and seas, plants are confined to land-surfaces;\r\nand unless their remains are swept along by streams and embedded in\r\nsediments which are accumulating on the sea floor, the chance of their\r\npreservation is but small. The strata richest in fossil plants are\r\noften those which have been laid down on the floor of an inland lake\r\nor spread out as river-borne sediment under the waters of an estuary.\r\nUnlike the hard endo- and exo-skeletons of animals, the majority of\r\nplants are composed of comparatively soft material, and are less likely\r\nto be preserved or to retain their original form when exposed to the\r\nwear and tear which must often accompany the process of fossilisation.\r\n\r\nThe Coal-Measure rocks have furnished numberless relics of a Palaeozoic\r\nvegetation, and these occur in various forms of preservation in\r\nrocks laid down in shallow water on the edge of a forest-covered\r\nland. The underclays or unstratified argillaceous beds which nearly\r\nalways underlie each seam of coal have often been described as old\r\nsurface-soils, containing numerous remains of roots and creeping\r\nunderground stems of forest trees. The overlying coal has been regarded\r\nas a mass of the carbonised and compressed débris of luxuriant forests\r\nwhich grew on the actual spot now occupied by the beds of coal. There\r\nare, however, many arguments in favour of regarding the coal seams as\r\nbeds of altered vegetable material which was spread out on the floor\r\nof a lagoon or lake, while the underclay was an old soil covered by\r\nshallow water or possibly a swampy surface tenanted by marsh-loving\r\nplants[65].\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic beds of the Yorkshire Coast, long famous as some of the\r\nrichest plant-bearing strata in Britain, and the Wealden rocks of the\r\nsouth coast afford examples of Mesozoic sediments which were laid\r\ndown on the floor of an estuary or large lake. Circumstances have\r\noccasionally rendered possible the preservation of old land-surfaces\r\nwith the stumps of trees still in their position of growth. One of the\r\nbest examples of this in Britain are the so-called dirt-beds or black\r\nbands of Portland and the Dorset Coast. On the cliffs immediately east\r\nof Lulworth Cove, the surface of a ledge of Purbeck limestone which\r\njuts out near the top of the cliffs, is seen to have the form here and\r\nthere of rounded projecting bosses or ‘Burrs’ several feet in diameter.\r\nIn the centre of each boss there is either an empty depression, or the\r\nremnants of a silicified stem of a coniferous tree. Blocks of limestone\r\n3 to 5 feet long and of about equal thickness may be found lying on\r\nthe rocky ledge presenting the appearance of massive sarcophagi in\r\nwhich the central trough still contains the silicified remains of an\r\nentombed tree. The calcareous sediment no doubt oozed up to envelope\r\nthe thick stem as it sank into the soft mud. An examination of the rock\r\njust below the bed bearing these curious circular elevations reveals\r\nthe existence of a comparatively narrow band of softer material, which\r\nhas been worn away by denuding agents more rapidly than the overlying\r\nlimestone. This band consists of partially rounded or subangular stones\r\nassociated with carbonaceous material, and probably marks the site of\r\nan old surface-soil. This old soil is well shown in the cliffs and\r\nquarries of Portland, and similar dirt-beds occur at various horizons\r\nin the Lower and Middle Purbeck Series[66]. In this case, then, we\r\nhave intercalated in a series of limestone beds containing marine and\r\nfreshwater shells two or three plant beds containing numerous and\r\nfrequently large specimens of cycadean and coniferous stems, lying\r\nhorizontally or standing in their original position of growth. These\r\nare vestiges of an ancient forest which spread over a considerable\r\nextent of country towards the close of the Jurassic period. The trunks\r\nof cycads, long familiar in the Isle of Portland as fossil crows’\r\nnests, have usually the form of round depressed stems with the central\r\nportion somewhat hollowed out. It was supposed by the quarrymen that\r\nthey were petrified birds’ nests which had been built in the forks of\r\nthe trees which grew in the Portland forest. The beds separating the\r\nsurface-soils of the Purbeck Series, as seen in the sections exposed\r\non the cliffs or quarries, point to the subsidence of a forest-covered\r\narea over which beds of water-borne sediment were gradually deposited,\r\nuntil in time the area became dry land and was again taken possession\r\nof by a subtropical vegetation, to be once more depressed and sealed up\r\nunder layers of sediment[67].\r\n\r\nA still more striking example of the preservation of forest trees\r\nrooted in an old surface-soil is afforded by the so-called fossil-grove\r\nin Victoria Park, Glasgow, (Frontispiece). The stumps of several trees,\r\nvarying in diameter from about one to three feet, are fixed by long\r\nforking ‘roots’ in a bed of shale. In some cases the spreading ‘roots,’\r\nwhich bear the surface features of _Stigmaria_, extend for a distance\r\nof more than ten feet from the base of the trunk. The stem surface is\r\nmarked by irregular wrinklings which suggest a fissured bark; but the\r\nsuperficial characters are very imperfectly preserved. In one place a\r\nflattened _Lepidodendron_ stem, about 30 feet long, lies prone on the\r\nshale. Each of the rooted stumps is oval or elliptical in section, and\r\nthe long axes of the several stems are approximately parallel, pointing\r\nto some cause operating in a definite direction which gave to the stems\r\ntheir present form. Near one of the trees, and at a somewhat higher\r\nlevel than its base, the surface of the rock is clearly ripple-marked,\r\nand takes us back to the time when the sinking forest trees were washed\r\nby waves which left an impress in the soft mud laid down over the\r\nsubmerged area. The stumps appear to be those of Lepidodendron trees,\r\nrooted in Lower Carboniferous rocks. From their manner of occurrence\r\nit would seem that we have in them a corner of a Palaeozoic forest in\r\nwhich Lepidodendra played a conspicuous part. The shales and sandstones\r\ncontaining the fossil trees were originally overlain by a bed of\r\nigneous rock which had been forced up as a sheet of lava into the\r\nhardened sands and clays[68].\r\n\r\nOther examples of old surface-soils occur in different parts of the\r\nworld and in rocks of various ages. As an instance of a land surface\r\npreserved in a different manner, reference may be made to the thin\r\nbands of reddish or brown material as well as clays and shale which\r\noccasionally occur between the sheets of Tertiary lava in the Western\r\nIsles of Scotland and the north-east of Ireland. In the intervals\r\nbetween successive outpourings of basaltic lava in the north-west of\r\nEurope during the early part of the Tertiary period, the heated rocks\r\nbecame gradually cooler, and under the influence of weathering agents a\r\nsurface-soil was produced fit for the growth of plants. In some places,\r\ntoo, shallow lakes were formed, and leaves, fruits and twigs became\r\nembedded in lacustrine sediments, to be afterwards sealed up by later\r\nstreams of lava. In the face of the cliff at Ardtun Head on the coast\r\nof Mull a leaf-bed is exposed between two masses of gravel underlying a\r\nbasaltic lava flow; the impressions of the leaves of _Gingko_ and other\r\nplants from the Tertiary sediments of this district are exceptionally\r\nbeautiful and well preserved[69]. A large collection obtained by Mr\r\nStarkie Gardner may be seen in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the Malayan island of Krakatoa, 20 miles from Sumatra and\r\nJava, was the scene of an exceptionally violent volcanic explosion.\r\nTwo-thirds of the island were blown away, and the remnant was left\r\nabsolutely bare of organic life. In 1886 it was found that several\r\nplants had already established themselves on the hardened and weathered\r\ncrust of the Krakatoan rocks, the surface of the lavas having been to a\r\nlarge extent prepared for the growth of the higher plants by the action\r\nof certain blue-green algae which represent some of the lowest types\r\nof plant life[70]. We may perhaps assume a somewhat similar state of\r\nthings to have existed in the volcanic area in north-west Europe, where\r\nthe intervals between successive outpourings of lava are represented by\r\nthe thin bands of leaf-beds and old surface-soils.\r\n\r\nOn the Cheshire Coast at Leasowe[71] and other localities, there is\r\nexposed at low water a tract of black peaty ground studded with old\r\nrooted stumps of conifers and other trees (fig. 6). There is little\r\nreason to doubt that at all events the majority of the trees are in\r\ntheir natural place of growth. The peaty soil on which they rest\r\ncontains numerous flattened stems of reeds and other plants, and is\r\npenetrated by roots, probably of some aquatic or marshy plants which\r\nspread over the site of the forest as it became gradually submerged. A\r\nlower forest-bed rests directly on a foundation of boulder clay. Such\r\nsubmerged forests are by no means uncommon around the British coast;\r\nmany of them belong to a comparatively recent period, posterior to the\r\nglacial age. In many cases, however, the tree stumps have been drifted\r\nfrom the places where they grew and eventually deposited in their\r\nnatural position, the roots of the trees, in some cases aided by stones\r\nentangled in their branches, being heavier than the stem portion.\r\nThere is a promising field for botanical investigation in the careful\r\nanalysis of the floras of submerged forests; the work of Clement Reid,\r\nNathorst, Andersson and others, serves to illustrate the value of such\r\nresearch in the hands of competent students.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Part of a submerged Forest seen at low water on\r\n  the Cheshire Coast at Leasowe. Drawn from a photograph.]\r\n\r\nThe following description by Lyell, taken from his American travels,\r\nis of interest as affording an example of the preservation of a\r\nsurface-soil:\r\n\r\n  “On our way home from Charleston, by the railway from Orangeburg, I\r\n  observed a thin black line of charred vegetable matter exposed in\r\n  the perpendicular section of the bank. The sand cast out in digging\r\n  the railway had been thrown up on the original soil, on which\r\n  the pine forest grew; and farther excavations had laid open the\r\n  junction of the rubbish and the soil. As geologists, we may learn\r\n  from this fact how a thin seam of vegetable matter, an inch or two\r\n  thick, is often the only monument to be looked for of an ancient\r\n  surface of dry land, on which a luxuriant forest may have grown\r\n  for thousands of years. Even this seam of friable matter may be\r\n  washed away when the region is submerged, and, if not, rain water\r\n  percolating freely through the sand may, in the course of ages,\r\n  gradually carry away the carbon[72].”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL WOOD.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the remnants of ancient soils, and the preservation\r\nof plant fragments in rocks which have been formed on the floor of\r\nan inland lake or an estuary, it is by no means rare to find fossil\r\nplants in obviously marine sediments. In fig. 7 we have a piece of\r\nconiferous wood with the shell of an Ammonite (_Aegoceras planicosta_\r\nSow.) lying on it; the specimen was found in the Lower Lias clay at\r\nLyme Regis, and illustrates the accidental association of a drifted\r\npiece of a forest tree with a shell which marks at once the age and the\r\nmarine character of the beds. Again in fig. 8 we have a block of flint\r\npartially enclosing a piece of coniferous wood in which the internal\r\nstructure has been clearly preserved in silica. This specimen was found\r\nin the chalk, a deposit laid down in the clear and deep water of the\r\nCretaceous sea. The wood must have floated for some time before it\r\nbecame water-logged and sank to the sea-floor. In the light coloured\r\nwood there occur here and there dark spots which mark the position of\r\nsiliceous plugs _b, b_ filling up clean cut holes bored by Teredos\r\nin the woody tissue. The wood became at last enclosed by siliceous\r\nsediment and its tissues penetrated by silica in solution, which\r\ngradually replaced and preserved in wonderful perfection the form of\r\nthe original tissue. A similar instance of wood enclosed in flint was\r\nfigured by Mantell in 1844 in his _Medals of Creation_[73].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. _Aegoceras planicosta_ Sow. on a piece of\r\n  coniferous wood, Lower Lias, Lyme Regis.

In the side view, shown above in the figure, the\r\n  position of the wood is shown by the lighter portion, with holes, _b,\r\n  b_, bored by Teredos or some other wood-eating animal. In the end\r\n  view, below, the wood is seen as an irregular cylinder _w, w_,\r\n  embedded in a matrix of flint. ⅓ Nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe specimen represented in fig. 9 illustrates the almost complete\r\ndestruction of a piece of wood by some boring animal. The circular and\r\noval dotted patches represent the filled up cavities made by a Teredo\r\nor some similar wood-boring animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.

In\r\n  placid corners sometimes I noted a collected mass nearly half a\r\n  foot deep, among which, on examination, I could scarcely find a\r\n  leaf that was perfect, or that remained attached to its rightful\r\n  neighbour, so that were they to become imbedded in some soft muddy\r\n  spot, and in after ages to reappear in a fossil form they would\r\n  afford a few difficult puzzles to the palaeontologist, both to\r\n  separate and to put together[74].”\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of the mixture of plants and animals in\r\nsedimentary deposits is described by Hooker in his Himalayan Journals:—\r\n\r\n  “To the geologist the Jheels and Sunderbunds are a most instructive\r\n  region, as whatever may be the mean elevation of their waters,\r\n  a permanent depression of ten to fifteen feet would submerge an\r\n  immense tract, which the Ganges, Burrampooter, and Soormah would\r\n  soon cover with beds of silt and sand.\r\n\r\n  “There would be extremely few shells in the beds thus formed,\r\n  the southern and northern divisions of which would present two\r\n  very different floras and faunas, and would in all probability\r\n  be referred by future geologists to widely different epochs. To\r\n  the north, beds of peat would be formed by grasses, and in other\r\n  parts temperate and tropical forms of plants and animals would be\r\n  preserved in such equally balanced proportions as to confound the\r\n  palaeontologist; with the bones of the long-snouted alligator,\r\n  Gangetic porpoise, Indian cow, buffalo, rhinoceros, elephant,\r\n  tiger, deer, bear, and a host of other animals, he would meet with\r\n  acorns of several species of oak, pine-cones and magnolia fruits,\r\n  rose seeds, and _Cycas_ nuts, with palm nuts, screw-pines, and\r\n  other tropical productions[75].”\r\n\r\nIn another place the same author writes:\r\n\r\n  “On the 12th of January, 1848, the _Moozuffer_ was steaming amongst\r\n  the low, swampy islands of the Sunderbunds.... Every now and then\r\n  the paddles of the steamer tossed up the large fruits of _Nypa\r\n  fruticans_, Thunb., a low stemless palm that grows in the tidal\r\n  waters of the Indian Ocean, and bears a large head of nuts. It\r\n  is a plant of no interest to the common observer, but of much to\r\n  the geologist, from the nuts of a similar plant abounding in the\r\n  Tertiary formations at the mouth of the Thames, having floated\r\n  about there in as great profusion as here, till buried deep in the\r\n  silt and mud that now forms the island of Sheppey[76].”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DRIFTING OF TREES.]\r\n\r\nOf the drifting of timber, fruits, &c., we find numerous accounts in\r\nthe writings of travellers. Rodway thus describes the formation of\r\nvegetable rafts in the rivers of Northern British Guiana:—\r\n\r\n  “Sometimes a great tree, whose timber is light enough to float,\r\n  gets entangled in the grass, and becomes the nucleus of an immense\r\n  raft, which is continually increasing in size as it gathers up\r\n  everything that comes floating down the river[77].”\r\n\r\nThe undermining of river banks in times of flood, and the transport of\r\nthe drifted trees to be eventually deposited in the delta is a familiar\r\noccurrence in many parts of the world. The more striking instances of\r\nsuch wholesale carrying along of trees are supplied by Bates, Lyell and\r\nother writers. In his description of the Amazon the former writes:\r\n\r\n  “The currents ran with great force close to the bank, especially\r\n  when these receded to form long bays or _enseadas_, as they are\r\n  called, and then we made very little headway. In such places the\r\n  banks consist of loose earth, a rich crumbling vegetable mould,\r\n  supporting a growth of most luxuriant forest, of which the currents\r\n  almost daily carry away large portions, so that the stream for\r\n  several yards out is encumbered with fallen trees, whose branches\r\n  quiver in the current[78].”\r\n\r\nIn another place, Bates writes:\r\n\r\n  “The rainy season had now set in over the region through which the\r\n  great river flows; the sand-banks and all the lower lands were\r\n  already under water, and the tearing current, two or three miles in\r\n  breadth, bore along a continuous line of uprooted trees and islets\r\n  of floating plants[79].”\r\n\r\nThe rafts of the Mississippi and other rivers described by Lyell afford\r\ninstructive examples of the distant transport of vegetable material.\r\nThe following passage is taken from the _Principles of Geology_;\r\n\r\n  “Within the tropics there are no ice-floes; but, as if to\r\n  compensate for that mode of transportation, there are floating\r\n  islets of matted trees, which are often borne along through\r\n  considerable spaces. These are sometimes seen sailing at the\r\n  distance of fifty or one hundred miles from the mouth of the\r\n  Ganges, with living trees standing erect upon them. The Amazons,\r\n  the Orinoco, and the Congo also produce these verdant rafts[80].”\r\n\r\nAfter describing the enormous natural rafts of the Atchafalaya, an arm\r\nof the Mississippi, and of the Red river, Lyell goes on to say:\r\n\r\n  “The prodigious quantity of wood annually drifted down by the\r\n  Mississippi and its tributaries is a subject of geological\r\n  interest, not merely as illustrating the manner in which abundance\r\n  of vegetable matter becomes, in the ordinary course of nature,\r\n  imbedded in submarine and estuary deposits, but as attesting the\r\n  constant destruction of soil and transportation of matter to lower\r\n  levels by the tendency of rivers to shift their courses.... It\r\n  is also found in excavating at New Orleans, even at the depth of\r\n  several yards below the level of the sea, that the soil of the\r\n  delta contains innumerable trunks of trees, layer above layer, some\r\n  prostrate as if drifted, others broken off near the bottom, but\r\n  remaining still erect, and with their roots spreading on all sides,\r\n  as if in their natural position[81].”\r\n\r\nThe drifting of trees in the ocean is recorded by Darwin in his\r\ndescription of Keeling Island, and their action as vehicles for the\r\ntransport of boulders is illustrated by the same account.\r\n\r\n  “In the channels of Tierra del Fuego large quantities of drift\r\n  timber are cast upon the beach, yet it is extremely rare to meet a\r\n  tree swimming in the water. These facts may possibly throw light\r\n  on single stones, whether angular or rounded, occasionally found\r\n  embedded in fine sedimentary masses[82].”\r\n\r\nFruits may often be carried long distances from land, and preserved\r\nin beds far from their original source. Whilst cruising amongst the\r\nSolomon Islands, the Challenger met with fruits of _Barringtonia\r\nspeciosa_ &c., 130–150 miles from the coast. Off the coast of New\r\nGuinea long lines of drift wood were seen at right angles to the\r\ndirection of the river; uprooted trees, logs, branches, and bark, often\r\nfloating separately.\r\n\r\n  “The midribs of the leaves of a pinnate-leaved palm were abundant,\r\n  and also the stems of a large cane grass (_Saccharum_), like that\r\n  so abundant on the shores of the great river in Fiji. Various\r\n  fruits of trees and other fragments were abundant, usually floating\r\n  confined in the midst of the small aggregations into which the\r\n  floating timber was everywhere gathered.... Leaves were absent\r\n  except those of the Palm, on the midrib of which some of the\r\n  pinnæ were still present. The leaves evidently drop first to the\r\n  bottom, whilst vegetable drift is floating from a shore; thus, as\r\n  the débris sinks in the sea water, a deposit abounding in leaves,\r\n  but with few fruits and little or no wood, will be formed near\r\n  shore, whilst the wood and fruits will sink to the bottom farther\r\n  off the land. Much of the wood was floating suspended vertically\r\n  in the water, and most curiously, logs and short branch pieces\r\n  thus floating often occurred in separate groups apart from the\r\n  horizontally floating timber. The sunken ends of the wood were not\r\n  weighted by any attached masses of soil or other load of any kind;\r\n  possibly the water penetrates certain kinds of wood more easily in\r\n  one direction with regard to its growth than the other, hence one\r\n  end becomes water-logged before the other.... The wood which had\r\n  been longest in the water was bored by a _Pholas_[83].”\r\n\r\nThe bearing of this account on the manner of preservation of fossils,\r\nand the differential sorting so frequently seen in plant beds, is\r\nsufficiently obvious.\r\n\r\nAs another instance of the great distance to which land plants may be\r\ncarried out to sea and finally buried in marine strata, an observation\r\nby Bates may be cited. When 400 miles from the mouth of the main\r\nAmazons, he writes:\r\n\r\n  “We passed numerous patches of floating grass mingled with tree\r\n  trunks and withered foliage. Amongst these masses I espied many\r\n  fruits of that peculiar Amazonian tree the Ubussú Palm; this was\r\n  the last I saw of the great river[84].”\r\n\r\nThe following additional extract from the narrative of the Cruise of\r\nH.M.S. Challenger illustrates in a striking degree the conflicting\r\nevidence which the contents of fossiliferous beds may occasionally\r\nafford; it describes what was observed in an excursion from Sydney to\r\nBerowra Creek, a branch of the main estuary or inlet into which flows\r\nthe Hawkesbury river. It was impossible to say where the river came\r\nto an end and the sea began. The Creek is described as a long tortuous\r\narm of the sea, 10 to 15 miles long, with the side walls covered with\r\norchids and _Platycerium_. The ferns and palms were abundant in the\r\nlateral shady glens; marine and inland animals lived in close proximity.\r\n\r\n  “Here is a narrow strip of the sea water, twenty miles distant\r\n  from the open sea; on a sandy shallow flat close to its head are\r\n  to be seen basking in the sun numbers of sting-rays.... All over\r\n  these flats, and throughout the whole stretch of the creek, shoals\r\n  of Grey Mullet are to be met with; numerous other marine fish\r\n  inhabit the creek. Porpoises chase the mullet right up to the\r\n  commencement of the sand-flat. At the shores of the creek the rocks\r\n  are covered with masses of excellent oysters and mussel, and other\r\n  shell-bearing molluscs are abundant, whilst a small crab is to be\r\n  found in numbers in every crevice. On the other hand the water is\r\n  overhung by numerous species of forest trees, by orchids and ferns,\r\n  and other vegetation of all kinds; mangroves grow only in the\r\n  shallow bays. The gum trees lean over the water in which swim the\r\n  _Trygon_ and mullet, just as willows hang over a pool of carp. The\r\n  sandy bottom is full of branches and stems of trees, and is covered\r\n  in patches here and there by their leaves. Insects constantly fall\r\n  in the water, and are devoured by the mullet. Land birds of all\r\n  kinds fly to and fro across the creek, and when wounded may easily\r\n  be drowned in it. Wallabies swim across occasionally, and may add\r\n  their bones to the débris at the bottom. Hence here is being formed\r\n  a sandy deposit, in which may be found cetacean, marsupial, bird,\r\n  fish, and insect remains, together with land and sea shells, and\r\n  fragments of a vast land flora; yet how restricted is the area\r\n  occupied by this deposit, and how easily might surviving fragments\r\n  of such a record be missed by future geological explorers![85]”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEANING OF THE TERM ‘FOSSIL.’]\r\n\r\nThe term ‘fossil’ suggests to the lay mind a petrifaction or a\r\nreplacement by mineral matter of the plant tissues. In the scientific\r\nsense, a fossil plant, that is a plant or part of a plant whether\r\nin the form of a true petrifaction or a structureless mould or\r\ncast, which has been buried in the earth by natural causes, may be\r\nindistinguishable from a piece of recent wood lately fallen from the\r\nparent tree. In the geologically recent peat beds such little altered\r\nfossils (or sub-fossils) are common enough, and even in older rocks\r\nthe more resistant parts of plant fragments are often found in a\r\npractically unaltered state. In the leaf impressions on an impervious\r\nclay, the brown-walled epidermis shows scarcely any indication of\r\nalteration since it was deposited in the soft mud of a river’s delta.\r\nSuch fossil leaves are common in the English Tertiary beds, and even in\r\nPalaeozoic rocks it is not uncommon to find an impression of a plant\r\non a bed of shale from which the thin brown epidermis may be peeled\r\noff the rock, and if microscopically examined it will be found to have\r\nretained intact the contours of the cuticularised epidermal cells. A\r\nstriking example of a similar method of preservation is afforded by\r\nthe so-called paper-coal of Culm age from the Province of Toula in\r\nRussia[86]. In the Russian area the Carboniferous or Permian rocks have\r\nbeen subjected to little lateral pressure, and unlike the beds of the\r\nsame age in Western Europe, they have not been folded and compressed by\r\nwidespread and extensive crust-foldings. Instead of the hard seams of\r\ncoal there occur beds of a dark brown laminated material, made up very\r\nlargely of the cuticles of Lepidodendroid plants.\r\n\r\nFrom such examples we may naturally pass to fossils in which the plant\r\nstructure has been converted into carbonaceous matter or even pure\r\ncoal. This form of preservation is especially common in plant-bearing\r\nbeds at various geological horizons. In other cases, again, some\r\nmineral solution, oxide of iron, talc, and other substances, has\r\nreplaced the plant tissues. From the Coal-Measures of Switzerland Heer\r\nhas figured numerous specimens of fern fronds and other plants in which\r\nthe leaf form has been left on the dark coloured rock surface as a thin\r\nlayer of white talcose material[87]. In the Buntersandstone of the\r\nVosges and other districts the red imperfectly preserved impressions\r\nof plant stems and leaves are familiar fossils[88]; the carbonaceous\r\nsubstance of the tissues has been replaced by a brown or red oxide of\r\niron.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INCRUSTATIONS.]\r\n\r\nPlants frequently occur in the form of incrustations; and in fact\r\nincrustations, which may assume a variety of forms, are the commonest\r\nkind of fossil. The action of incrusting springs, or as they are\r\noften termed petrifying springs, is illustrated at Knaresborough, in\r\nYorkshire, and many other places where water highly charged with\r\ncarbonate of lime readily deposits calcium carbonate on objects placed\r\nin the path of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe travertine deposited in this manner forms an incrustation on plant\r\nfragments, and if the vegetable substance is subsequently removed by\r\nthe action of water or decay, a mould of the embedded fragment is\r\nleft in the calcareous matrix. An instructive example of this form of\r\npreservation was described in 1868[89] by Sharpe from an old gravel pit\r\nnear Northampton. He found in a section eight feet high (fig. 10), a\r\nmass of incrusted plants of _Chara_ (_a_) resting on and overlain by a\r\ncalcareous paste (_c_) and (_d_) made up of the decomposed material of\r\nthe overlying rock, and this again resting on sand. The place where the\r\nsection occurred was originally the site of a pool in which Stoneworts\r\ngrew in abundance. Large blocks of these incrusted Charas may be seen\r\nin the fossil-plant gallery of the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Section of an old pool filled up with a mass of\r\n  _Chara_. (From the _Geol. Mag._ vol. v. 1868, p. 563.)]\r\n\r\nIn the Natural History Museum in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, one\r\nof the table-cases contains what appear to be small models of flowers\r\nin green wax. These are in reality casts in wax of the moulds or\r\ncavities left in a mass of calcareous travertine, on the decay and\r\ndisappearance of the encrusted flowers and other plant fragments[90].\r\nThis porous calcareous rock occurs near Sézanne in Southern France,\r\nand is of Eocene age[91]. The plants were probably blown on to the\r\nfreshly deposited carbonate of lime, or they may have simply fallen\r\nfrom the tree on to the incrusting matrix; more material was afterwards\r\ndeposited and the flowers were completely enclosed. Eventually the\r\nplant substance decayed, and as the matrix hardened moulds were left\r\nof the vegetable fragments. Wax was artificially forced into these\r\ncavities and the surrounding substance removed by the action of an\r\nacid, and thus perfect casts were obtained of Tertiary flowers.\r\n\r\nDarwin has described the preservation of trees in Van Diemen’s land\r\nby means of calcareous substances. In speaking of beds of blown sand\r\ncontaining branches and roots of trees he says:\r\n\r\n  “The whole became consolidated by the percolation of calcareous\r\n  matter; and the cylindrical cavities left by the decaying of the\r\n  wood were thus also filled up with a hard pseudo-stalactitical\r\n  stone. The weather is now wearing away the softer parts, and in\r\n  consequence the hard casts of the roots and branches of the trees\r\n  project above the surface, and, in a singularly deceptive manner,\r\n  resemble the stumps of a dead thicket[92].”\r\n\r\nAs a somewhat analogous method of preservation to that in travertine,\r\nthe occurrence of plants in amber should be mentioned. In Eocene times\r\nthere existed over a region, part of which is now the North-east\r\nGerman coast, an extensive forest of conifers and other trees. Some\r\nof the conifers were rich in resinous secretions which were poured\r\nout from wounded surfaces or from scars left by falling branches.\r\nAs these flowed as a sticky mass over the stem or collected on the\r\nground, flowers, leaves, and twigs blown by the wind or falling from\r\nthe trees, became embedded in the exuded resin. Evaporation gradually\r\nhardened the resinous substance until the plant fragments became\r\nsealed up in a mass of amber, in precisely the same manner in which\r\nobjects are artificially preserved in Canada balsam. In many cases the\r\namber acts as a petrifying agent, and by penetrating the tissues of a\r\npiece of wood it preserves the minute structural details in wonderful\r\nperfection[93]. Dr Thomas in an account of the amber beds of East\r\nPrussia in 1848, refers to the occurrence of large fossil trees; he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n  “The continuous changes to which the coast is exposed, often bring\r\n  to light enormous trunks of trees, which the common people had\r\n  long regarded as the trunks of the amber tree, before the learned\r\n  declared that they were the stems of palm trees, and in consequence\r\n  determined the position of Paradise to be on the coast of East\r\n  Prussia[94].”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CASTS OF TREES.]\r\n\r\nIn 1887 an enormous fossil plant was discovered in a sandstone\r\nquarry at Clayton near Bradford[95]. The fossil was in the form of a\r\nsandstone cast of a large and repeatedly branched _Stigmaria_, and it\r\nis now in the Owens College Museum, where it was placed through the\r\ninstrumentality of Prof. Williamson. The plant was found spread out\r\nin its natural position on the surface of an arenaceous shale, and\r\noverlain by a bed of hard sandstone identical with the material of\r\nwhich the cast is composed. Williamson has thus described the manner of\r\nformation of the fossil:\r\n\r\n  “It is obvious that the entire base of the tree became encased in a\r\n  plastic material, which was firmly moulded upon these roots whilst\r\n  the latter retained their organisation sufficiently unaltered to\r\n  enable them to resist all superincumbent pressure. This external\r\n  mould then hardened firmly, and as the organic materials decayed\r\n  they were floated out by water which entered the branching cavity;\r\n  at a still later period the same water was instrumental in\r\n  replacing the carbonaceous elements by the sand of which the entire\r\n  structure now consists[96].”\r\n\r\nAlthough the branches have not been preserved for their whole length,\r\nthey extend a distance of 29 feet 6 inches from right to left, and 28\r\nfeet in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe fossil represented in fig. 1 (p. 10), from the collection of Dr\r\nJohn Woodward, affords a good example of a well-defined impression.\r\nThe surface of the specimen, of which a cast is represented in fig. 1,\r\nshows very clearly the characteristic leaf-cushions and leaf-scars\r\nof a _Lepidodendron_. The stem was embedded in soft sand, and as the\r\nlatter became hard and set, an impression was obtained of the external\r\nmarkings of the _Lepidodendron_. Decay subsequently removed the\r\nsubstance of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. _Equisetites columnaris_ Brongn. From a\r\n  specimen in the Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge. ⅓ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nIn fig. 11 some upright stems of a fossil Horse-tail (_Equisetites\r\ncolumnaris_) from the Lower Oolite rocks near Scarborough, are seen in\r\na vertical position in sandstone. On the surface of the fossils there\r\nis a thin film of carbonaceous matter, which is all that remains of the\r\noriginal plant substance; the stems were probably floated into their\r\npresent position and embedded vertically in an arenaceous matrix. The\r\nhollow pith-cavity was filled with sand, and as the tissues decayed\r\nthey became in part converted into a thin coaly layer. The vertical\r\nposition of such stems as those in fig. 11 naturally suggests their\r\npreservation _in situ_, but in this as in many other cases the erect\r\nmanner of occurrence is due to the settling down of the drifted plants\r\nin this particular position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CASTS.]\r\n\r\nAn example of _Stigmaria_ drawn in fig. 12 further illustrates the\r\nformation of casts[97]. The outer surface with the characteristic\r\nspirally arranged circular depressions, represents the wrinkled bark of\r\nthe dried plant; the smaller cylinder, on the left side of the upper\r\nend (fig. 12, 2, _p_) marks the position of the pith surrounded by the\r\nsecondary wood, which has been displaced from its axial position. The\r\npith decayed first, and the space was filled in with mud; somewhat\r\nlater the wood and cortex were partially destroyed, and the rod of\r\nmaterial which had been introduced into the pith-cavity dropped towards\r\none side of the decaying shell of bark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. _Stigmaria ficoides_ Brongn. 1. Side view,\r\n  showing wrinkled surface and the scars of appendages. 2. End view\r\n  (upper) showing the displaced central cylinder; _p_, pith, _x_,\r\n  xylem, _r_, medullary rays. 3. End view (lower). From a specimen in\r\n  the Woodwardian Museum. ½ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nAs the parenchymatous medullary rays readily decayed, the mud in\r\nthe pith extended outwards between the segments of wood which still\r\nremained intact, and so spokes of argillaceous material were formed\r\nwhich filled the medullary ray cavities. The cortical tissues were\r\ndecomposed, and their place taken by more argillaceous material. At one\r\nend of the specimen (fig. 12, 3) we find the wood has decayed without\r\nits place being afterwards filled up with foreign material. At the\r\nopposite end of the specimen, the woody tissue has been partially\r\npreserved by the infiltration of a solution containing carbonate of\r\nlime (fig. 12, 2).\r\n\r\nNumerous instances have been recorded from rocks of various geological\r\nages of casts of stems standing erect and at right angles to the\r\nbedding of the surrounding rock. These vertical trees occasionally\r\nattain a considerable length, and have been formed by the filling\r\nin by sand or mud of a pipe left by the decay of the stem. It is\r\nfrequently a matter of some difficulty to decide how far such fossils\r\nare in the position of growth of the tree, or whether they are merely\r\ncasts of drifted stems, which happen to have been deposited in an\r\nerect position. The weighting of floating trees by stones held in the\r\nroots, added to the greater density of the root wood, has no doubt\r\noften been the cause of this vertical position. In attempting to\r\ndetermine if an erect cast is in the original place of growth of the\r\ntree, it is important to bear in mind the great length of time that\r\nwood is able to resist decay, especially under water. The wonderful\r\nstate of preservation of old piles found in the bed of a river, and\r\nthe preservation of wooden portions of anchors of which the iron has\r\nbeen completely removed by disintegration, illustrate this power of\r\nresistance. In this connection, the following passage from Lyell’s\r\ntravels in America is of interest. In describing the site of an old\r\nforest, he writes[98]:\r\n\r\n  “Some of the stumps, especially those of the fir tribe, take fifty\r\n  years to rot away, though exposed in the air to alternations of\r\n  rain and sunshine, a fact on which every geologist will do well\r\n  to reflect, for it is clear that the trees of a forest submerged\r\n  beneath the water, or still more, if entirely excluded from the\r\n  air, by becoming imbedded in sediment, may endure for centuries\r\n  without decay, so that there may have been ample time for the slow\r\n  petrifaction of erect fossil trees in the Carboniferous and other\r\n  formations, or for the slow accumulation around them of a great\r\n  succession of strata.”\r\n\r\nIn another place, in speaking of the trees in the Great Dismal Swamp,\r\nLyell writes:—“When thrown down, they are soon covered by water,\r\nand keeping wet they never decompose, except the sap wood, which is\r\nless than an inch thick[99].” We see, then, that trees may have\r\nresisted decay for a sufficiently long time to allow of a considerable\r\ndeposition of sediment. It is very difficult to make any computation of\r\nthe rate of deposition of a particular set of sedimentary strata, and,\r\ntherefore, to estimate the length of time during which the fossil stems\r\nmust have resisted decay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLANTS AND COAL.]\r\n\r\nThe protective qualities of humus acids, apart from the almost complete\r\nabsence of Bacteria[100] from the waters of Moor- or Peat-land, is a\r\nfactor of great importance in the preservation of plants against decay\r\nfor many thousands of years.\r\n\r\nFrom examples of fossil stems or leaves in which the organic material\r\nhas been either wholly or in part replaced by coal, we may pass by a\r\ngradual transition to a mass of opaque coal in which no plant structure\r\ncan be detected. It is by no means uncommon to notice on the face of a\r\npiece of coal a distinct impression of a plant stem, and in some cases\r\nthe coal is obviously made up of a number of flattened and compressed\r\nbranches or leaves of which the original tissues have been thoroughly\r\ncarbonised. A block of French coal, represented in fig. 13, consists\r\nvery largely of laminated bands composed of the long parallel veined\r\nleaves of the genus _Cordaites_ and of the bark of _Lepidodendron_,\r\n_Sigillaria_, and other Coal-Measure genera. The long rhizomes and\r\nroots below the coal are preserved as casts in the underclay.\r\n\r\nIn examining thin sections of coal, pieces of pitted tracheids or\r\ncrushed spores are frequently met with as fragments of plant structures\r\nwhich have withstood decay more effectually than the bulk of the\r\nvegetable débris from which the coal was formed.\r\n\r\nThe coaly layer on a fossil leaf is often found to be without any trace\r\nof the plant tissues, but not infrequently such carbonised leaves, if\r\ntreated with certain reagents and examined microscopically, are seen\r\nto retain the outlines of the epidermal cells of the leaf surface. If\r\na piece of the Carbonaceous film detached from a fossil leaf is left\r\nfor some days in a small quantity of nitric acid containing a crystal\r\nof chlorate of potash, and, after washing with water, is transferred\r\nto ammonia, transparent film often shows very clearly the outlines\r\nof the epidermal cell and the form of the stomata. Such treatment has\r\nbeen found useful in many cases as an aid to determination[101]. Prof.\r\nZeiller informs me that he has found it particularly satisfactory in\r\nthe case of cycadean leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Part of a coal seam largely made up of\r\n  _Cordaites_ leaves. _Stigmaria_ and _Stigmariopsis_ shown in the rock\r\n  (underclay) underlying the coal. (After Grand’Eury [82] Pl. I. fig.\r\n  3.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSILS IN HALF-RELIEF.]\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes possible to detach the thin lamina representing the\r\ncarbonised leaf or other plant fragment from the rock on which it lies\r\nand to mount it whole on a slide. Good examples of plants treated in\r\nthis way may be seen in the Edinburgh and British Museums, especially\r\n_Sphenopteris_ fronds from the Carboniferous oil shales of Scotland.\r\nIn the excellent collection of fossil plants in Stockholm there are\r\nstill finer examples of such specimens, obtained by Dr Nathorst from\r\nsome of the Triassic plants of Southern Sweden. In a few instances the\r\ntissues of a plant have been converted into coal in such a manner as\r\nto retain the form of the individual cells, which appear in section\r\nas a black framework in a lighter coloured matrix. Examples of such\r\ncarbonised tissues were figured by some of the older writers, and\r\nSolms-Laubach has recently[102] described sections of Palaeozoic plants\r\npreserved in this manner. The section represented in fig. 70 is that\r\nof a Calamite stem (8 × 9·5 cm.) in which the wood has been converted\r\ninto carbonaceous material, but the more delicate tissues have been\r\nalmost completely destroyed. The thin and irregular black line a\r\nlittle distance outside the ring of wood, and forming the limit of the\r\ndrawing, probably represents the cuticle. The whole section is embedded\r\nin a homogeneous matrix of calcareous rock, in which the more resistant\r\ntissues of the plant have been left as black patches and faint lines.\r\n\r\nMention should be made of a special form of preservation which has been\r\ndescribed as fossilisation in half-relief. If a stem is imbedded in\r\nsand or mud, the matrix receives an impression of the plant surface,\r\nand if the hollow pith-cavity is filled with the surrounding sediment,\r\nthe surface of the medullary cast will exhibit markings different from\r\nthose seen on the surface in contact with the outside of the stem. The\r\nspace separating the pith-cast from the mould bearing the impression of\r\nthe stem surface may remain empty, or it may be filled with sedimentary\r\nmaterial. In half-relief fossils, on the other hand, we have projecting\r\nfrom the under surface of a bed a more or less rounded and prominent\r\nridge with certain surface markings, and fitting into a corresponding\r\ngroove in the underlying rock on which the same markings have been\r\nimpressed. It is conceivable that such a cast might be obtained if\r\nsoft plant fragments were lying on a bed of sand, and were pressed into\r\nit by the weight of superincumbent material. The plant fragment would\r\nbe squeezed into a depression, and its substance might eventually be\r\nremoved and leave no other trace than the half-relief cast and hollow\r\nmould. A twig lying on sand would by its own weight gradually sink a\r\nlittle below the surface; if it were then blown away or in some manner\r\nremoved, the depression would show the surface features of the twig.\r\nWhen more sand came to be spread out over the depression, it would\r\nfind its way into the pattern of the mould, and so produce a cast. If\r\nat a later period when the sand had hardened, the upper portion were\r\nseparated from the lower, from the former there would project a rounded\r\ncast of the hollow mould. The preservation of soft algae as half-relief\r\ncasts has been doubted by Nathorst[103] and others as an unlikely\r\noccurrence in nature. They prefer to regard such ridges on a rock face\r\nas the casts of the trails or burrows of animals. This question of the\r\npreservation of the two sides of a mould showing the same impression\r\nof a plant has long been a difficult problem; it is discussed by\r\nParkinson in his _Organic Remains_. In one of the letters (No. XLVI.),\r\nhe quotes the objection of a sceptical friend, who refuses to believe\r\nsuch a manner of preservation possible, “until,” says Parkinson, “I\r\ncan inform him if, by involving a guinea in plaster of Paris, I could\r\nobtain two impressions of the king’s head, without any impression of\r\nthe reverse[104].”\r\n\r\nIt would occupy too much space to attempt even a brief reference to the\r\nvarious materials in which impressions of plants have been preserved.\r\nCarbonaceous matter is the most usual substance, and in some cases\r\nit occurs in the form of graphite which on dark grey or black rocks\r\nhas the appearance of a plant drawn in lead pencil. The impressions\r\nof plants on the Jurassic (Kimeridgian) slates of Solenhofen[105] in\r\nBavaria, like those on the Triassic sandstones of the Vosges, are\r\nusually marked out in red iron oxide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PETRIFIED TREES.]\r\n\r\nSo far we have chiefly considered examples of plants preserved in\r\nvarious ways by _incrustation_, that is, by having been enclosed in\r\nsome medium which has received an impression of the surface of the\r\nplant in contact with it. By far the most valuable fossil specimens\r\nfrom a botanical point of view are however those in which the internal\r\nstructure has been preserved; that is in which the preserving medium\r\nhas not served merely as an encasing envelope or internal cast, but has\r\npenetrated into the body of the plant fragment and rendered permanent\r\nthe organization of the tissues. In almost every Natural History or\r\nGeological Museum one meets with specimens of petrified trees or\r\npolished sections of fossil palm stems and other plants, in which\r\nthe internal structure has been preserved in siliceous material, and\r\nadmits of detailed investigation in thin sections under the microscope.\r\nSilica, calcium carbonate, with usually a certain amount of carbonate\r\nof iron and magnesium carbonate, iron pyrites, amber, and more rarely\r\ncalcium fluoride or other substances have taken the place of the\r\noriginal cell-walls. Of silicified stems, those from Antigua, Egypt,\r\nCentral France, Saxony, Brazil, Tasmania[106], and numerous other\r\nplaces afford good examples. Darwin records numerous silicified stems\r\nin Northern Chili, and the Uspallata Pass. In the central part of the\r\nAndes range, 7000 feet high, he describes the occurrence of “Snow-white\r\nprojecting silicified columns.... They must have grown,” he adds, “in\r\nvolcanic soil, and were subsequently submerged below sea-level, and\r\ncovered with sedimentary beds and lava-flows[107].” A striking example\r\nof the occurrence of numerous petrified plant stems has been described\r\nby Holmes from the Tertiary forests of the Yellowstone Park. From\r\nthe face of a cliff on the north side of Amethyst mountain “rows of\r\nupright trunks stand out on the ledges like the columns of a ruined\r\ntemple. On the more gentle slopes farther down, but where it is still\r\ntoo steep to support vegetation, save a few pines, the petrified\r\ntrunks fairly cover the surface, and were at first supposed by us to\r\nbe the shattered remains of a recent forest[108].” Marsh[109] and\r\nConwentz[110] have described silicified trees more than fifty feet\r\nin length from a locality in California where several large forest\r\ntrees of Tertiary age have been preserved in volcanic strata. In South\r\nAfrica on the Drakenberg hills there occur numerous silicified trunks,\r\noccasionally erect and often lying on the ground, probably of Triassic\r\nage[111]. In some instances the specimens measure several feet in\r\nlength and diameter. Some of the coniferous stems seen in Portland,\r\nand occasionally met with reared up against a house side, illustrate\r\nthe silicification of plant structure on a large scale. These are of\r\nUpper Jurassic (Purbeck) age. From Grand’Croix in France a silicified\r\nstem of _Cordaites_ of Palaeozoic age has been recorded with a length\r\nof twenty meters. The preservation of plants by siliceous infiltrations\r\nhas long been known. One of the earliest descriptions of this form\r\nof petrifaction in the British Isles is that of stems found in Lough\r\nNeagh, Ireland. In his lectures on Natural Philosophy, published at\r\nDublin in 1751, Barton gives several figures of Irish silicified wood,\r\nand records the following occurrence in illustration of the peculiar\r\nproperties erroneously attributed to the waters of Lough Neagh.\r\nDescribing a certain specimen (No. XXVI), he writes:—\r\n\r\n  “This is a whetstone, which as Mr Anthony Shane, apothecary, who\r\n  was born very near the lake, and is now alive, relates, he made by\r\n  putting a piece of holly in the water of the lake near his father’s\r\n  house, and fixing it so as to withstand the motion of the water,\r\n  and marking the place so as to distinguish it, he went to Scotland\r\n  to pursue his studies, and seven years after took up a stone\r\n  instead of holly, the metamorphosis having been made in that time.\r\n  This account he gave under his handwriting. The shore thereabouts\r\n  is altogether loose sand, and two rivers discharge themselves into\r\n  the lake very near that place[112].”\r\n\r\nThe well-known petrified trees from the neighbourhood of Lough Neagh\r\nare probably of Pliocene age, but their exact source has been a matter\r\nof dispute[113].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PETRIFIED WOOD.]\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Stokes described certain stems in which the tissues had been\r\npartially mineralised. In describing a specimen of beech from a Roman\r\naqueduct at Eibsen in Lippe Bückeburg], he says:—\r\n\r\n  “The wood is, for the most part, in the state of very old dry wood,\r\n  but there are several insulated portions, in which the place of the\r\n  wood has been taken by carbonate of lime. These portions, as seen\r\n  on the surface of the horizontal section, are irregularly circular,\r\n  varying in size, but generally a little less or more than ⅛ inch in\r\n  diameter, and they run through the whole thickness of the specimen\r\n  in separate, perpendicular columns. The vessels of the wood are\r\n  distinctly visible in the carbonate of lime, and are more perfect\r\n  in their form and size in those portions of the specimen than in\r\n  that which remains unchanged[114].”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.\r\n\r\n  A. _Araucarioxylon Withami_ (L. and H.). Radiating lines of\r\n      crystallisation in secondary wood, as seen in transverse\r\n      section.\r\n\r\n  B. _Lepidodendron_ sp. Concentric lines of crystallisation, and\r\n      scalariform tracheids, as seen in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\nThis partial petrifaction of the structure in patches is often met with\r\nin fossil stems, and may be seriously misleading to those unfamiliar\r\nwith the appearance presented by the crystallisation of silica from\r\nscattered centres in a mass of vegetable tissue. A good example of\r\nthis is afforded by the gigantic stems discovered in 1829 in the\r\nCraigleith Quarry near Edinburgh[115]. Of those two large stems found\r\nin the Sandstone rock, the longest, originally 11 meters long and\r\n3·3–3·9 meters in girth, is now set up in the grounds of the British\r\nMuseum, and a large polished section (1 m. × 87 cm.) is exhibited in\r\nthe Fossil-plant Gallery. The other stem is in the Botanic Garden,\r\nEdinburgh. Transverse sections of the wood of the London specimen show\r\nscattered circular patches (fig. 14 A) in the mineralised wood in which\r\nthe tracheids are very clearly preserved; while in the other portion\r\nthe preservation is much less perfect. The patch of tissue in fig. 14\r\nA shows a portion of the wood of the Craigleith tree [_Araucarioxylon\r\nWithami_ (L. and H.)] in which the mineral matter, consisting of\r\ndolomite with a little silica here and there, has crystallised in such\r\na manner as to produce what is practically a cone-in-cone structure\r\non a small scale, which has partially obliterated the structural\r\nfeatures. This minute cone-in-cone structure is not uncommon in\r\npetrified tissues; it is precisely similar in appearance to that\r\ndescribed by Cole[116] in certain minerals. The crystallisation has\r\nbeen set up along lines radiating from different centres, and the\r\nparticles of the tissue have been pushed as it were along these lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Transverse section of the central cylinder of a\r\n  Carboniferous Lepidodendroid stem in the collection of Mr Kidston.\r\n  From Dalmeny, Scotland. _s._ Silica filling up the central portion of\r\n  the pith. _p._ Remains of the pith tissue. _x_¹. Primary xylem. _x_².\r\n  Secondary xylem. _c._ Innermost cortex.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRESERVATION OF TISSUES.]\r\n\r\nA somewhat different crystallisation phenomenon is illustrated by\r\nthe extremely fine section of a Lepidodendroid plant shown in fig.\r\n15. The tissues of the primary and secondary wood (_x_¹ and _x_²)\r\nare well preserved throughout in silica, but scattered through the\r\nsiliceous matrix there occur numerous circular patches, as seen in the\r\nfigure. One of these is more clearly shown in fig. 14 B drawn from\r\na longitudinal section through the secondary wood, _x_²; it will be\r\nnoticed that where the concentric lines of the circular patch occur,\r\nthe scalariform thickenings of the tracheids are sharply defined, but\r\nimmediately a tracheid is free of the patch these details are lost.\r\nIt would appear that in this case silicification was first completed\r\nround definite isolated centres, and the secondary crystallisation in\r\nthe matrix partially obliterated some of the more delicate structural\r\nfeatures. The same phenomenon has been observed in oolitic rocks[117],\r\nin which the oolitic grains have resisted secondary crystallisation and\r\nso retained their original structure.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important examples of silicified plants are those from\r\na few localities in Central France. In the neighbourhood of Autun\r\nthere used to be found in abundance loose nodules of siliceous rock\r\ncontaining numerous fragments of seeds, twigs, and leaves of different\r\nplants. The rock of which the broken portions are found on the surface\r\nof the ground was formed about the close of the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nAt the hands of French investigators the microscopic examination of\r\nthese fragments of a Palaeozoic vegetation have thrown a flood of\r\nlight on the anatomical structure of many extinct types. Sometimes the\r\nsilica has penetrated the cavities of the cells and vessels, and the\r\nwalls have decayed without their substance being replaced by mineral\r\nmaterial. Sections of tissues preserved in this manner, if soaked in a\r\ncoloured solution assume an appearance almost identical with that of\r\nstained sections of recent plants. The spaces left by the decayed walls\r\nact as fine capillaries and suck up the coloured solution[118].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. Internal cast of a sclerenchymatous cell from\r\n  the root of a Cretaceous fern (_Rhizodendron oppoliense_ Göpp.).\r\n  After Stenzel (86) Pl. III. fig. 29. × 240 and reduced to one-half.]\r\n\r\nIn the Coal-Measure sandstones of England large pieces of woody\r\nstems are occasionally met with in which the mineralisation has been\r\nincomplete. A brown piece of fossil stem lying in a bed of sandstone\r\nshows on the surface a distinct woody texture, and the lines of wood\r\nelements are clearly visible. The whole is, however, very friable and\r\nfalls to pieces if an attempt is made to cut thin sections of it;\r\nthe tracheids of the wood easily fall apart owing to the walls being\r\nimperfectly preserved, and the absence of a connecting framework\r\nsuch as would have been formed had the membranes been thoroughly\r\nsilicified. It is occasionally possible to obtain from petrified plant\r\nstems perfect casts in silica or other substances of the cavity of\r\na sclerenchymatous fibre, in which the mineral has been deposited\r\nnot only in the cavity but in the fine pit-canals traversing the\r\nlignified walls. Such a cast is represented in fig. 16, the fine\r\nlateral projections are the delicate casts of the pit canals. Numerous\r\ninstances of minute and delicate tissues preserved in silica are\r\nrecorded in later chapters. A somewhat unusual type of silicification\r\nis met with in some of the Gondwana rocks of India, in which cycadean\r\nfronds occur as white porcellaneous specimens showing a certain amount\r\nof internal structure in a siliceous matrix. Specimens of such leaves\r\nmay be seen in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COAL-BALLS.]\r\n\r\nIn the Coal-Measures of England, especially in the neighbourhood of\r\nHalifax in Yorkshire, and in South Lancashire, the seams of coal\r\noccasionally contain calcareous nodules varying in size from a nut to\r\na man’s head, and consisting of about 70% of carbonate of calcium and\r\nmagnesium, and 30% of oxide of iron, sulphide of iron, &c.[119] The\r\nnodules, often spoken of by English writers as ‘coal-balls,’ contain\r\nnumerous fragments of plants in which the minute cellular structure is\r\npreserved with remarkable perfection. It should be noted that the term\r\ncoal-ball is also applied to rounded or subangular pieces of coal which\r\nare occasionally met with in coal seams, and especially in certain\r\nFrench coal fields. To avoid confusion it is better to speak of the\r\nplant-containing nodules as calcareous nodules, restricting the term\r\ncoal-ball to true coal pebbles. A section of a calcareous nodule, when\r\nseen under the microscope, presents the appearance of a matrix of a\r\ncrystalline calcareous substance containing a heterogeneous mixture of\r\nall kinds of plant tissues, usually in the form of broken pieces and in\r\na confused mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. A thin section of a calcareous nodule from the\r\n  Coal-Measures. Binney collection, Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge. Very\r\n  slightly reduced.]\r\n\r\nA large section of one of these nodules (12·5 cm. × 8·5 cm.) is\r\nshown in fig. 17. It illustrates the manner of occurrence of various\r\nfragments of different plants in which the structure has been\r\nmore or less perfectly preserved. In this particular example we\r\nsee sections of _Myeloxylon_ (I), _Calamites_ (II), Fern petioles\r\n(_Rachiopteris_) (III), Stigmarian appendages (IV), Lepidodendroid\r\nleaves (V), _Myeloxylon_ pinnules (VI), Gymnospermous seeds (VII),\r\nTwig of a _Lepidodendron_, showing the central xylem cylinder and\r\nlarge leaf-bases on the outer cortex, (VIII), Sporangia and spores\r\nof a strobilus (IX), Tangential section of a _Myeloxylon_ petiole\r\n(X), _Rachiopteris_ sp. (XI), _Rachiopteris_ sp. (XII), Band of\r\nsclerenchymatous tissue (XIII), _Rachiopteris_ sp. (XIV).\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of a calcareous plant-nodule suggests a soft\r\npulpy mass of decaying vegetable débris, through which roots were able\r\nto bore their way, as in a piece of peat or leafy mould. Overlying\r\nthis accumulation of soft material there was spread out a bed of muddy\r\nsediment containing numerous calcareous shells, which supplied the\r\npercolating water with the material which was afterwards deposited in\r\nportions of the vegetable débris. According to this view the calcareous\r\nnodules of the coal seams represent local patches of a widespread\r\nmass of débris which were penetrated by a carbonated solution, and so\r\npreserved as samples of a decaying mass of vegetation, of which by far\r\nthe greater portion became eventually converted into coal[120].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL NUCLEI.]\r\n\r\nIn such nodules, we find that not only has the framework of the\r\ntissues been preserved, but frequently the remains of cell contents\r\nare clearly seen. In some cases the cells of a tissue may contain in\r\neach cavity a darker coloured spot, which is probably the mineralised\r\ncell nucleus. (Fig. 42, _A_, 1, p. 214.) The contents of secretory\r\nsacs, such as those containing gum or resin, are frequently found as\r\nblack rods filling up the cavity of the cell or canal. The contents\r\nof cells in some cases closely simulate starch grains, and such may\r\nhave been actually present in the tissues of a piece of a fossil\r\ndicotyledonous stem described by Thiselton-Dyer from the Lower Eocene\r\nThanet beds[121], and in the rhizome of a fossil _Osmunda_ recorded by\r\nCarruthers[122]. (Fig. 42, _B_, p. 214.)\r\n\r\nSchultze in 1855[123] recorded the discovery of cellulose by\r\nmicrochemical tests applied to macerated tissue from Tertiary lignite\r\nand coal. With reference to the possibility of recognising cell\r\ncontents in fossil tissue it is interesting to find that Dr Murray\r\nof Scarborough had attempted, and apparently with success, to apply\r\nchemical tests to the tissues of Jurassic leaves. In a letter written\r\nto Hutton in 1833 Murray speaks of his experiments as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “Reverting to the Oolitic plants, I have again and with better\r\n  success been experimenting upon the thin transparent films of\r\n  leaves, chiefly of _Taeniopteris vittata_ and _Cyclopteris_, which\r\n  from their tenuity offer fine objects for the microscope.... By\r\n  many delicate trials I have ascertained the existence still in\r\n  these leaves of resin and of tannin.... I am seeking among the\r\n  filmy leaves of the _Fucoides_ of A. Brongniart for iodine, but\r\n  hitherto without success, and indeed can hardly expect it, as\r\n  probably did iodine exist in them, it must have long ago entered\r\n  into new combinations[124].”\r\n\r\nApart from this difficulty, it is not surprising that Dr Murray’s\r\nsearch for iodine was unsuccessful, considering how little algal nature\r\nmost of the so-called Fucoids possess.\r\n\r\nSome of the most perfectly preserved tissues as regards the details of\r\ncell contents are those of gymnospermous seeds from Autun. In sections\r\nof one of these seeds which I recently had the opportunity of examining\r\nin Prof. Bertrand’s collection, the parenchymatous cells contained very\r\ndistinct nuclei and protoplasmic contents. In one portion of the tissue\r\nin the nucellus of _Sphaerospermum_ the cell walls had disappeared,\r\nbut the nuclei remained in a remarkable state of preservation. The\r\ncells shown in fig. 42 are from the ground tissue of a petiole of\r\n_Cycadeoidea gigantea_ Sew.[125], a magnificent Cycadean stem from\r\nPortland recently added to the British Museum collection; in the cell\r\n_A_, 1, the nucleus is fairly distinct and in 2 and 4 the contracted\r\ncell-contents is clearly seen. Other interesting examples of fossil\r\nnuclei are seen in a _Lyginodendron_ leaf figured by Williamson and\r\nScott in a recent Memoir on that genus[126]. Each mesophyll cell\r\ncontains a single dark nucleus. The mineralisation of the most delicate\r\ntissues and the preservation of the various forms of cell-contents\r\nare now generally admitted by those at all conversant with the\r\npossibilities of plant petrifaction. If we consider what these facts\r\nmean—the microscopic investigation of not only the finest framework\r\nbut even the very life-substance of Palaeozoic plants—we feel that\r\nthe aeons since the days when these plants lived have been well-nigh\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the plant tissues have assumed a black and somewhat ragged\r\nappearance, giving the impression of charred wood. A section of a\r\nrecent burnt piece of wood resembles very closely some of the fossil\r\ntwigs from the coal seam nodules. It is possible that in such cases we\r\nhave portions of mineralised tissues which were first burnt in a forest\r\nfire or by lightning and then infiltrated with a petrifying solution.\r\nAn example of one of these black petrified plants is shown in fig. 74\r\nB. Chap. X. In many of the fossil plants there are distinct traces of\r\nfungus or bacterial ravages, and occasionally the section of a piece\r\nof mineralised wood shows circular spaces or canals which have the\r\nappearance of being the work of some wood-eating animal, and small oval\r\nbodies sometimes occur in such spaces which may be the coprolites of\r\nthe xylophagous intruder. (Fig. 24, p. 107.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL PLANTS IN VOLCANIC ASH.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known to geologists that during the Permian and\r\nCarboniferous periods the southern portion of Scotland was the scene of\r\nwidespread volcanic activity. Forests were overwhelmed by lava-streams\r\nor showers of ash, and in some districts tree stems and broken plant\r\nfragments became sealed up in a volcanic matrix. Laggan Bay in the\r\nnorth-east corner of the Isle of Arran, and Pettycur a short distance\r\nfrom Burntisland on the north shore of the Firth of Forth, are two\r\nlocalities where petrified plants of Carboniferous age occur in such\r\npreservation as allows of a minute investigation of their internal\r\nstructure. The occurrence of plants in the former locality was first\r\ndiscovered by Mr Wünsch of Glasgow; the fossils occur in association\r\nwith hardened shales and beds of ash, and are often exceedingly well\r\npreserved[127]. In fig. 18 is reproduced a sketch of a hollow tree\r\ntrunk from Arran, probably a _Lepidodendron_ stem, in which only the\r\nouter portion of the bark has been preserved, while the inner cortical\r\ntissues have been removed and the space occupied by volcanic detritus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Diagrammatic sketch of a slab cut from a fossil\r\n  stem (_Lepidodendron_?) from Laggan Bay. _e_, Imperfectly preserved\r\n  bark of a large stem, extending in patches round the periphery of\r\n  the specimen; the oval and circular bodies in the interior are the\r\n  xylem portions of the central cylinders of _Lepidodendron_ stems,\r\n  _x_¹, primary wood, _x_², secondary wood. From a specimen in the\r\n  Binney collection, Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge. ⅕ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe smaller cylindrical structures in the interior of the hollow trunk\r\nare the central woody cylinders of Lepidodendroid trees; each consists\r\nof an axial pith surrounded by a band of primary wood and a broader\r\nzone of secondary wood. One of the axes probably belonged to the stem\r\nof which only the shell has been preserved, the others must have come\r\nfrom other trees and may have been floated in by water[128]. The\r\nmicroscopic details of the wood and outer cortex have in this instance\r\nbeen preserved in a calcareous material, which was no doubt derived by\r\nwater percolating through the volcanic ash. It is frequently found that\r\nin fossil trees or twigs a separation of the tissues has taken place\r\nalong such natural lines of weakness as the cambium or the phellogen,\r\nbefore the petrifying medium had time to permeate the entire structure.\r\nTree stems recently killed by lava streams during volcanic eruptions at\r\nthe present day supply a parallel with the Palaeozoic forest trees of\r\nCarboniferous times.\r\n\r\nGuillemard in describing a volcanic crater in Celebes, speaks of burnt\r\ntrees still standing in the lava stream, “so charred at the base of\r\nthe trunk that we could easily push them down[129].” An interesting\r\ncase is quoted by Hooker in his _Himalayan Journals_, illustrating the\r\noccurrence of a hollow shell of a tree, in which the outer portions of\r\na stem had been left while the inner portions had disappeared, the wood\r\nbeing hollow and so favourable to the production of a current of air\r\nwhich accelerated the destruction of the internal tissues.\r\n\r\nOn the coast near Burntisland on the Firth of Forth blocks of rock are\r\nmet with in which numerous plant fragments of Carboniferous age are\r\nscattered in a confused mass through a calcareous volcanic matrix. The\r\ntwigs, leaves, spores, and other portions are in small fragments, and\r\ntheir delicate cells are often preserved in wonderful perfection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONDITIONS OF PRESERVATION.]\r\n\r\nThe manner of occurrence of plants in sandstones, shales or other rocks\r\nis often of considerable importance to the botanist and geologist, as\r\nan aid to the correct interpretation of the actual conditions which\r\nobtained at the time when the plant remains were accumulating in beds\r\nof sediment. To attempt to restore the conditions under which any\r\nset of plants became preserved, we have to carefully consider each\r\nspecial case. A nest of seeds preserved as internal casts in a mass\r\nof sandstone, such as is represented by the block of Carboniferous\r\nsandstone in fig. 19, suggests a quiet spot in an eddy where seeds\r\nwere deposited in the sandy sediment. Delicate leaf structures with\r\nsporangia still intact, point to quietly flowing water and a transport\r\nof no great distance. Occasionally the large number of delicate and\r\nlight plant fragments, associated it may be with insect wings, may\r\nfavour the idea of a wind storm which swept along the lighter pieces\r\nfrom a forest-clad slope and deposited them in the water of a lake. In\r\nsome Tertiary plant-beds the manner of occurrence of leaves and flowers\r\nis such as to suggest a seasonal alternation, and the different layers\r\nof plant débris may be correlated with definite seasons of growth[130].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Piece of Coal-Measures Sandstone with casts of\r\n  _Trigonocarpon_ seeds, from Peel Quarry near Wigan. From a specimen\r\n  in the Manchester Museum, Owens College. ½ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe predominance of certain classes of plants in a particular bed may\r\nbe due to purely mechanical causes and to differential sorting by\r\nwater, or it may be that the district traversed by the stream which\r\ncarried down the fragments was occupied almost exclusively by one set\r\nof plants. The trees from higher ground may be deposited in a different\r\npart of a river’s course to those growing in the plains or lowland\r\nmarshes. It is obviously impossible to lay down any definite rules\r\nas to the reading of plant records, as aids to the elucidation of\r\npast physical and botanical conditions. Each case must be separately\r\nconsidered, and the various probabilities taken into account, judging\r\nby reference to the analogy of present day conditions.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts, more or less successful, have been made to imitate\r\nthe natural processes of plant mineralisation[131]. By soaking sections\r\nof wood for some time in different solutions, and then exposing them\r\nto heat, the organic substance of the cell walls has been replaced by\r\na deposit of oxide of iron and other substances. Fern leaves heated to\r\nredness between pieces of shale have been reduced to a condition very\r\nsimilar to that of fossil fronds. Pieces of wood left for centuries\r\nin disused mines have been found in a state closely resembling\r\nlignite[132]. Attempts have also been made to reproduce the conditions\r\nunder which vegetable tissues were converted into coal, but as yet\r\nthese have not yielded results of much scientific value. The Geysers\r\nof Yellowstone Park have thrown some light on the manner in which wood\r\nmay be petrified by the percolation of siliceous solutions; and it has\r\nbeen suggested that the silicification of plants may have been effected\r\nby the waters of hot springs holding silica in solution. Examples of\r\nwood in process of petrifaction in the Geyser district of North America\r\nhave been recorded by Kuntze[133], and discussed by Schweinfurth[134],\r\nSolms-Laubach[135] and others[136]. The latter expresses the opinion\r\nthat by a long continuance of such action as may now be observed in the\r\nneighbourhood of hot springs, the organic substance of wood might be\r\nreplaced by siliceous material. The exact manner of replacement needs\r\nmore thorough investigation. Kuntze describes the appearance of forest\r\ntrees which have been reached by the waters of neighbouring Geysers.\r\nThe siliceous solution rises in the wood by capillarity; the leaves,\r\nbranches and bark are gradually lost, and the outer tissues of the\r\nwood become hardened and petrified as the result of evaporation from\r\nthe exposed surface of the stem. The products of decay going on in the\r\nplant tissues must be taken into account, and the double decomposition\r\nwhich might result. There is no apparent reason why experiments\r\nundertaken with pieces of recent wood exposed to permeation by various\r\ncalcareous and siliceous solutions under different conditions should\r\nnot furnish useful results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n               DIFFICULTIES AND SOURCES OF ERROR IN THE\r\n                    DETERMINATION OF FOSSIL PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Robinson Crusoe did not feel bound to conclude, from the single\r\n  human footprint which he saw in the sand, that the maker of the\r\n  impression had only one leg.”\r\n                                  HUXLEY’S _Hume_, p. 105, 1879.\r\n\r\nThe student of palaeobotany has perhaps to face more than his due\r\nshare of difficulties and fruitful sources of error; but on the other\r\nhand there is the compensating advantage that trustworthy conclusions\r\narrived at possess a special value. While always on the alert for\r\nrational explanations of obscure phenomena by means of the analogy\r\nsupplied by existing causes, and ready to draw from a wide knowledge of\r\nrecent botany, in the interpretation of problems furnished by fossil\r\nplants, the palaeobotanist must be constantly alive to the necessity\r\nfor cautious statement. That there is the greatest need of moderation\r\nand safe reasoning in dealing with the botanical problems of past ages,\r\nwill be apparent to anyone possessing but a superficial acquaintance\r\nwith fossil plant literature. The necessity for a botanical and\r\ngeological training has already been referred to in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no useful purpose, and would occupy no inconsiderable\r\nspace, to refer at length to the numerous mistakes which have been\r\ncommitted by experienced writers on the subject of fossil plants.\r\nLaymen might find in such a list of blunders a mere comedy of errors,\r\nbut the palaeobotanist must see in them serious warnings against\r\ndogmatic conclusions or expressions of opinion on imperfect data and\r\ninsufficient evidence. The description of a fragment of a handle of\r\na Wedgwood teapot as a curious form of Calamite[137] and similar\r\ninstances of unusual determinations need not detain us as examples of\r\ninstructive errors. The late Prof. Williamson has on more than one\r\noccasion expressed himself in no undecided manner as to the futility of\r\nattempting to determine specific forms among fossil plants, without the\r\naid of internal structure[138]; and even in the case of well-preserved\r\npetrifactions he always refused to commit himself to definite specific\r\ndiagnoses. In his remarks in this connection, Williamson no doubt\r\nallowed himself to express a much needed warning in too sweeping\r\nlanguage. It is one of the most serious drawbacks in palaeobotanical\r\nresearches that in the majority of cases the specimens of plants are\r\nboth fragmentary and without any trace of internal structure. Specimens\r\nin which the anatomical characters have been preserved necessarily\r\npossess far greater value from the botanist’s point of view than\r\nthose in which no such petrifaction has occurred. On the other hand,\r\nhowever, it is perfectly possible with due care to obtain trustworthy\r\nand valuable results from the examination of structureless casts and\r\nimpressions. In dealing with the less promising forms of plant fossils,\r\nthere is in the first place the danger of trusting to superficial\r\nresemblance. Hundreds of fossil plants have been described under the\r\nnames of existing genera on the strength of a supposed agreement\r\nin external form; but such determinations are very frequently not\r\nonly valueless but dangerously misleading. Unless the evidence is\r\nof the best, it is a serious mistake to make use of recent generic\r\ndesignations. If we consider the difficulties which would attend an\r\nattempt to determine the leaves, fragments of stems and other detached\r\nportions of various recent genera, we can better appreciate the greater\r\nprobability of error in the case of imperfectly preserved fossil\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXTERNAL RESEMBLANCE.]\r\n\r\nThe portions of stems represented in figures 20 and 21, exhibit\r\na fairly close resemblance to one another; in the absence of\r\nmicroscopical sections or of the reproductive organs it would be\r\npractically impossible to discriminate with any certainty between\r\nfossil specimens of the plants shown in the drawings. Examples such\r\nas these, and many others which might be cited, serve to illustrate\r\nthe possibility of confusion not merely between different genera of\r\nthe same family, but even between members of different classes or\r\ngroups. The long slender branches of the _Polygonum_ represented in\r\n(fig. 21) would naturally be referred to _Equisetum_ in the absence\r\nof the flowers (fig. 20 _B_), or without a careful examination of the\r\ninsignificant scaly leaves borne at the nodes. The resemblance between\r\n_Casuarina_ and _Ephedra_ and the British species of _Equisetum_, or\r\nsuch a tropical form as _E. debile_, speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.\r\n\r\n  _A._  _Restio tetraphylla_ Labill.

From a specimen\r\nfrom Java in the British Museum herbarium. ⅓ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nEndless examples might be quoted illustrating the absolute futility,\r\nin many cases, of relying on external features even for the purpose\r\nof class distinction. An acquaintance with the general habit and\r\nappearance of only the better known members of a family, frequently\r\nleads to serious mistakes. The specimen shown in fig. 22 is a leaf of a\r\ntropical fern _Kaulfussia_, a genus now living in South-eastern Asia,\r\nand a member of one of the most important and interesting families\r\nof the Filicinæ, the Marrattiaceæ; its form is widely different from\r\nthat which one is accustomed to associate with fern fronds. It is\r\nunlikely that the impression of a sterile leaf of _Kaulfussia_ would be\r\nrecognised as a portion of a fern plant.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in another exceedingly important group of plants, the\r\nCycadaceæ[139], the examples usually met with in botanical gardens\r\nare quite insufficient as standards of comparison when we are dealing\r\nwith fossil forms. Familiarity with a few commoner types leads us\r\nto regard them as typical for the whole family. In Mesozoic times\r\ncycadean plants were far more numerous and widely distributed than\r\nat the present time, and to adequately study the numerous fossil\r\nexamples we need as thorough an acquaintance as possible with the\r\ncomparatively small number of surviving genera and species. The less\r\ncommon and more isolated species of an existing family may often be\r\nof far greater importance to the palaeobotanist than the common and\r\nmore typical forms. This importance of rare and little known types\r\nwill be more fully illustrated in the chapters dealing with the\r\nCycadaceæ and other plant groups. Among Dicotyledons, the Natural Order\r\nProteaceæ, at present characteristic of South Africa and Australia,\r\nand also represented in South America and the Pacific Islands, is\r\nof considerable interest to the student of fossil Angiosperms. In a\r\nvaluable address delivered before the Linnean Society[140] in 1870\r\nBentham drew attention to the marked ‘protean’ character of the members\r\nof this family. He laid special stress on this particular division of\r\nthe Dicotyledons in view of certain far-reaching conclusions, which had\r\nbeen based on the occurrence in different parts of Europe of fossil\r\nleaves supposed to be those of Proteaceous genera[141]. Speaking of\r\ndetached leaves, Bentham says:—“I do not know of a single one which, in\r\noutline or venation, is exclusively characteristic of the order, or of\r\nany one of its genera.” Species of _Grevillea_, _Hakea_ and a few other\r\ngenera are more or less familiar in plant houses, but the leaf-forms\r\nillustrated by the commoner members of the family convey no idea of the\r\nenormous variation which is met with not only in the family as a whole,\r\nbut in the different species of the same genus. The striking diversity\r\nof leaf within the limits of a single genus will be dealt with more\r\nfully in volume II. under the head of Fossil Dicotyledons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENATION CHARACTERS.]\r\n\r\nThere is a common source of danger in attempting to carry too far the\r\nvenation characters as tests of affinity. The parallel venation of\r\nMonocotyledons is by no means a safe guide to follow in all cases as\r\na distinguishing feature of this class of plants. In addition to such\r\nleaves as those of the Gymnosperm _Cordaites_ and detached pinnæ of\r\nCycads, there are certain species of Dicotyledons which correspond in\r\nthe character of their venation to Monocotyledonous leaves. _Eryngium\r\nmontanum_ Coult., _E. Lassauxi_ Dcne., and other species of this\r\ngenus of _Umbelliferæ_ agree closely with such a plant as _Pandanus_\r\nor other Monocotyledons; similarly the long linear leaves of _Richea\r\ndracophylla_, R. Br., one of the Ericaceæ, are identical in form\r\nwith many monocotyledonous leaves. Instances might also be quoted of\r\nmonocotyledonous leaves, such as species of _Smilax_ and others which\r\nLindley included in his family of Dictyogens which correspond closely\r\nwith some types of Dicotyledons[142]. Venation characters must be used\r\nwith care even in determining classes or groups, and with still greater\r\nreserve if relied on as family or generic tests.\r\n\r\nIt is too frequently the case that while we are conversant with the\r\nmost detailed histological structure of a fossil plant stem, its\r\nexternal form is a matter of conjecture. The conditions which have\r\nfavoured the petrifaction of plant tissues have as a rule not been\r\nfavourable for the preservation of good casts or impressions of the\r\nexternal features; and, on the other hand, in the best impressions of\r\nfern fronds or other plants, in which the finest veins are clearly\r\nmarked, there is no trace of internal structure. It is, however,\r\nfrequently the case that a knowledge of the internal structure of\r\na particular plant enables us to interpret certain features in a\r\nstructureless cast which could not be understood without the help of\r\nhistological facts. A particularly interesting example of anatomical\r\nknowledge affording a key to apparently abnormal peculiarities in a\r\nspecimen preserved by incrustation, is afforded by the fructification\r\nof the genus _Sphenophyllum_. Some few years ago Williamson described\r\nin detail the structure of a fossil strobilus (_i.e._ cone) from the\r\nCoal-Measures, but owing to the isolated occurrence of the specimens\r\nhe was unable to determine the plant to which the strobilus belonged.\r\nOn re-examining some strobili of _Sphenophyllum_, preserved by\r\nincrustation, in the light of Williamson’s descriptions, Zeiller was\r\nable to explain certain features in his specimens which had hitherto\r\nbeen a puzzle, and he demonstrated that Williamson’s cone was that of a\r\n_Sphenophyllum_. Similar examples might be quoted, but enough has been\r\nsaid to emphasize the importance of dealing as far as possible with\r\nboth petrifactions and incrustations. The facts derived from a study of\r\na plant in one form of preservation may enable us to interpret or to\r\namplify the data afforded by specimens preserved in another form.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DECORTICATED STEMS.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that plants usually occur in detached fragments, and that\r\nthey have often been sorted by water, and that portions of the same\r\nplant have been embedded in sediment considerable distances apart,\r\nis a constant source of difficulty. Deciduous leaves, cones, or\r\nangiospermous flowers, and other portions of a plant which become\r\nnaturally separated from the parent tree, are met with as detached\r\nspecimens, and it is comparatively seldom that we have the necessary\r\ndata for reuniting the isolated members. As the result of the partial\r\ndecay and separation of portions of the same stem or branch, the wood\r\nand bark may be separately preserved. Darwin[143] describes how the\r\nbark often falls from _Eucalyptus_ trees, and hangs in long shreds,\r\nwhich swing about in the wind, and give to the woods a desolate and\r\nuntidy appearance. In the passage already quoted from the narrative\r\nof the voyage of the Challenger, illustrations are afforded of\r\nthe manner in which detached portions of plants are likely to be\r\npreserved in a fossil state. The epidermal layer of a leaf or the\r\nsurface tissues of a twig may be detached from the underlying tissues\r\nand separately preserved[144]. It is exceedingly common for a stem\r\nto be partially decorticated before preservation, and the appearance\r\npresented by a cast or impression of the surface of a woody cylinder,\r\nand by the same stem with a part or the whole of its cortex intact\r\nis strikingly different. The late Prof. Balfour[145] draws attention\r\nto this source of error in his text-book of palaeobotany, and gives\r\nfigures illustrating the different appearance presented by a branch\r\nof _Araucaria imbricata_ Pav. when seen with its bark intact and more\r\nor less decorticated. Specimens that are now recognised as casts of\r\nstems from which the cortex had been more or less completely removed\r\nbefore preservation, were originally described under distinct generic\r\nnames, such as _Bergeria_, _Knorria_ and others. These are now known\r\nto be imperfect examples of Sigillarian or Lepidodendroid plants.\r\nGrand’Eury[146] quotes the bark of _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_ Presl.\r\nas a fossil which has been described under twenty-eight specific names,\r\nand placed in several genera.\r\n\r\nSince the microscopical examination of fossil plant-anatomy was\r\nrendered possible, a more correct interpretation of decorticated and\r\nincomplete specimens has been considerably facilitated. The examination\r\nof tangential sections taken at different levels in the cortex of such\r\na plant as _Lepidodendron_ brings out the distribution of thin and\r\nthick-walled tissue. Regularly placed prominences on such a stem as the\r\n_Knorria_ shown in fig. 23 are due to the existence in the original\r\nstem of spirally disposed areas of thin-walled and less resistant\r\ntissue; as decay proceeded, the thinner cells would be the first to\r\ndisappear, and depressions would thus be formed in the surrounding\r\nthicker walled and stronger tissue. If the stem became embedded in mud\r\nor sand before the more resistant tissue had time to decay, but after\r\nthe removal of the thin-walled cells, the surrounding sediment would\r\nfill up the depressions and finally, after the complete decay of the\r\nstem, the impression on the mould or on the cast, formed by the filling\r\nup of the space left by the stem, would have the form of regularly\r\ndisposed projections marking the position of the more delicate tissues.\r\nThe specimen represented in the figure is an exceedingly interesting\r\nand well preserved example of a Coal-Measure stem combining in itself\r\nrepresentatives of what were formerly spoken of as distinct genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. A dichotomously branched Lepidodendroid stem\r\n  (_Knorria mirabilis_ Ren. and Zeill.). After Renault and\r\n  Zeiller[147]. (¼ nat. size.) The original specimen is in the\r\n  Natural History Museum, Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe surface of the fossil as seen at _e_ affords a typical example of\r\nthe Knorria type of stem; the spirally disposed peg-like projections\r\nare the casts of cavities formed by the decay of the delicate cells\r\nsurrounding each leaf-trace bundle on its way through the cortex of\r\nthe stem. The surface _g_ exhibits a somewhat different appearance,\r\nowing to the fact that we have the cast of the stem taken at a slightly\r\ndifferent level. The surface of the thick layer of coal at a shows\r\nvery clearly the outlines of the leaf-cushions; on the somewhat deeper\r\nsurfaces _b_, _c_ and _d_ the leaf-cushions are but faintly indicated,\r\nand the long narrow lines on the coal at _c_ represent the leaf-traces\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood of the leaf-cushions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IMPERFECT CASTS.]\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon among the older plant-bearing rocks to find a\r\npiece of sandstone or shale of which the surface exhibits a somewhat\r\nirregular reticulate pattern, the long and oval meshes having the\r\nform of slightly raised bosses. The size of such a reticulum may\r\nvary from one in which the pattern is barely visible to the unaided\r\neye to one with meshes more than an inch in length. The generic\r\nname _Lyginodendron_[148] was proposed several years ago (1843) for\r\na specimen having such a pattern on its surface, but without any\r\nclue having been found as to the meaning of the elongated raised\r\nareas separated from one another by a narrow groove. At a later date\r\nWilliamson investigated the anatomy of some petrified fragments\r\nof a Carboniferous plant which suggested a possible explanation\r\nof the surface features in the structureless specimens. The name\r\n_Lyginodendron_ was applied to this newly discovered plant, of which\r\none characteristic was found to be the occurrence of a hypodermal band\r\nof strong thick-walled tissue arranged in the form of a network with\r\nthe meshes occupied by thin-walled parenchyma. If such a stem were\r\nundergoing gradual decay, the more delicate tissue of the meshes would\r\nbe destroyed first and the harder framework left. A cast of such a\r\npartially decayed stem would take the form, therefore, of projecting\r\nareas, corresponding to the hollowed out areas of decayed tissue, and\r\nintervening depressions corresponding to the projecting framework of\r\nthe more resistant fibrous tissue. A precisely similar arrangement of\r\nhypodermal strengthening tissue occurs in various Palaeozoic and other\r\nplants, and casts presenting a corresponding appearance cannot be\r\nreferred with certainty to one special genus; such casts are of no real\r\nscientific value[149].\r\n\r\nThe old generic terms _Artisia_ and _Sternbergia_ illustrate another\r\nsource of error which can be avoided only by means of a knowledge of\r\ninternal structure. The former name was proposed by Sternberg and the\r\nlatter by Artis for precisely similar Carboniferous fossils, having the\r\nform of cylindrical bodies marked by numerous transverse annular ridges\r\nand grooves. These fossils are now known to be casts of the large\r\ndiscoid pith of the genus _Cordaites_, an extinct type of Palaeozoic\r\nGymnosperms. _Calamites_ and _Tylodendron_ afford other instances of\r\nplants in which the supposed surface characters have been shown to be\r\nthose of the pith-cast. The former genus is described at length in\r\na later chapter, but the latter may be briefly referred to. A cast,\r\napparently of a stem, from the Permian rocks of Russia was figured in\r\n1870 under the name _Tylodendron_; the surface being characterised by\r\nspirally arranged lozenge-shaped projections, described as leaf-scars.\r\nSpecimens were eventually discovered in which the supposed stem was\r\nshown to be a cast of the large pith of a plant possessing secondary\r\nwood very like that of the recent genus _Araucaria_. The projecting\r\nportions, instead of being leaf-cushions, were found to be the casts\r\nof depressions in the inner face of the wood where strands of vascular\r\ntissue bent outwards on their way to the leaves. If a cast is made of\r\nthe comparatively large pith of _Araucaria imbricata_ the features of\r\n_Tylodendron_ are fairly closely reproduced[150].\r\n\r\nA dried Bracken frond lying on the ground in the Autumn presents a very\r\ndifferent appearance as regards the form of the ultimate segments of\r\nthe frond to that of a freshly cut leaf. In the former the edges of\r\nthe pinnules are strongly recurved, and their shape is considerably\r\naltered. Immersed in water for some time fern fronds or other leaves\r\nundergo maceration, and the more delicate lamina of the leaf rots away\r\nmuch more rapidly than the scaffolding of veins. Among fossil fern\r\nfronds differences in the form of the pinnules and in the shape and\r\nextent of the lamina, to which a specific value is assigned, are no\r\ndoubt in many cases merely the expression either of differences in the\r\nstate of the leaves at the time of fossilisation or of the different\r\nconditions under which they became embedded. Differential decay and\r\ndisorganisation of plant tissues are factors of considerable importance\r\nwith regard to the fossilisation of plants. As Lindley[151] and later\r\nwriters have suggested, the absence or comparative scarcity of certain\r\nforms of plants from a particular fossil flora may in some cases be\r\ndue to their rapid decay and non-preservation as fossils; it does not\r\nnecessarily mean that such plants were unrepresented in the vegetation\r\nof that period. The decayed rhizomes of the Bracken fern often seen\r\nhanging from the roadside banks on a heath or moorland, and consisting\r\nof flat dark coloured bands of resistant sclerenchyma in a loose sheath\r\nof the hard shrivelled tissue, are in striking contrast to the perfect\r\nstem. A rotting Palm stem is gradually reduced to a loose stringy mass\r\nconsisting of vascular strands of which the connecting parenchymatous\r\ntissue has been entirely removed. It must frequently have happened that\r\ndetached vascular bundles or strands and plates of hard strengthening\r\ntissue have been preserved as fossils and mistaken for complete\r\nportions of plants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINERAL DEPOSITS SIMULATING PLANTS.]\r\n\r\nApart from the necessity of keeping in view the possible differences\r\nin form due to the state of the plant fragments at the time of\r\npreservation, and the marked contrast between the same species\r\npreserved in different kinds of rock, there are numerous sources of\r\nerror which belong to an entirely different category. The so-called\r\nmoss-agates and the well-known dendritic markings of black oxide of\r\nmanganese, are among the better known instances of purely inorganic\r\nstructures simulating plant forms.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of this striking similarity between a purely\r\nmineral deposit and the external form of a plant is afforded by some\r\nspecimens originally described as impressions of the oldest known fern.\r\nThe frontispiece to a well-known work on fossil plants, _Le monde des\r\nplantes avant l’apparition de l’homme_[152], represents a fern-like\r\nfossil on the surface of a piece of Silurian slate. The supposed plant\r\nwas named _Eopteris Morierei_ Sap., and it is occasionally referred\r\nto as the oldest land plant in books of comparatively recent date. In\r\nthe Museum of the School of Mines, Berlin, there are some specimens\r\nof Angers slate on some of which the cleavage face shows a shallow\r\nlongitudinal groove bearing on either side somewhat irregularly\r\noblong and oval appendages of which the surface is traversed by fine\r\nvein-like markings. A careful examination of the slate reveals the fact\r\nthat these apparent fern pinnules are merely films of iron pyrites\r\ndeposited from a solution which was introduced along the rachis-like\r\nchannel. Many of the extraordinary structures described as plants by\r\nReinsch[153] in his Memoir on the minute structure of coal have been\r\nshown to be of purely mineral origin.\r\n\r\nThe innumerable casts of animal-burrows and trails as well as the casts\r\nof egg-cases and various other bodies, which have been described as\r\nfossil algae, must be included among the most fruitful sources of error.\r\n\r\nIt requires but a short experience of microscopical investigation\r\nof fossil plant structures to discover numerous pitfalls in the\r\nappearance presented by sections of calcareous and siliceous nodules.\r\nThe juxtaposition of tissues apparently parts of the same plant, and\r\nthe penetration by growing roots of partially decayed plant débris,\r\nserve to mislead an unpractised observer. In sections of the English\r\n‘calcareous nodules’ one very frequently finds the tissue of Stigmarian\r\nappendages occupying every conceivable position, and preserved in\r\nplaces admirably calculated to lead to false interpretations. The\r\nmore minute investigation of tissues is often rendered difficult by\r\ndeceptive appearances simulating original structures, but which are\r\nin reality the result of mineralisation. It is no easy matter in\r\nsome cases to discover whether a particular cell in a fossil tissue\r\nwas originally thick-walled, or whether its sclerous appearance is\r\ndue to the deposition of mineral matter on the inside of the thin\r\ncell-membrane. Examples of such sources of error as have been briefly\r\nreferred to, and others, will be found in various parts of the\r\ndescriptive portions of this book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. _A._ Section of partially disorganised tissue\r\n  attacked by some boring animal. _c_, _c_, coprolites; _d_, a tunnel\r\n  made by the borer through the plant tissue.\r\n\r\n  _B._ Transverse section of a Lepidodendroid leaf, of which the\r\n  inner tissues have been destroyed and the cavity filled with\r\n  coprolites; simulating a sporangium containing spores. (A and B\r\n  from specimens in the Botanical Laboratory collection, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRACES OF WOOD-BORERS IN PETRIFIED TISSUE.]\r\n\r\nThere is one other form of pitfall which should be briefly noticed.\r\nIn sections of petrified plants one occasionally finds clean cut\r\ncanals penetrating a mass of tissue, and differing in their manner of\r\noccurrence and in their somewhat larger size from ordinary secretory\r\nducts. Such tunnels or canals are probably the work of a wood-boring\r\nanimal. An example is illustrated in fig. 24 _A_. Similarly it is not\r\nunusual to meet with groups or nests of spherical or elliptical bodies\r\nlying among plant tissues, and having the appearance of spores. Such\r\nspore-like bodies appear on close examination to be made up of finely\r\ncomminuted particles of tissue, and in all probability they are the\r\ncoprolites of some xylophagous animal. Examples of such coprolites are\r\nshown in fig. 24 _A_[154], and in fig. 24 _B_ an interesting manner of\r\noccurrence of these misleading bodies is represented. The framework\r\nof cells enclosing the nest of coprolites in fig. 24 _B_, represents\r\nthe outer tissues of a Lepidodendroid or a Sigillarian leaf; the inner\r\ntissues have been destroyed and the cavity is now occupied by what may\r\npossibly be the excreta of the wood-eating animal.\r\n\r\nSome of the oval spore-like structures met with in plant tissues\r\nmay, as Renault has suggested, be the eggs of an Arthropod[155].\r\nIn a section of a calcareous Coal-Measure nodule in the Williamson\r\ncollection (British Museum)[156] there occur several fungal spores\r\nor possibly oogonia lying among imperfectly preserved Stigmarian\r\nappendages. Associated with these are numerous dark coloured and larger\r\nbodies consisting of a cavity bounded by a simple membrane; the larger\r\nbodies may well be the eggs of some Arthropod or other animal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHOTOGRAPHY AND ILLUSTRATION.]\r\n\r\nIn looking through the collections of Coal-Measure plants in the\r\nMuseums of Berlin, Vienna and other continental towns, one cannot fail\r\nto be struck with the larger size of many of the specimens as compared\r\nwith those usually seen in English Museums. The facilities afforded\r\nin the State Collieries of Germany to the scientific investigator may\r\naccount in part at least for the better specimens which he is able\r\nto obtain. It would no doubt be a great gain to our collections of\r\nCoal-Measure plants if arrangements could be made in some collieries\r\nfor the preservation of the finer specimens met with in the working of\r\nthe seams, instead of breaking up the slabs of shale and consigning\r\neverything to the waste heaps. There is one more point which should be\r\nalluded to in connection with possible sources of error, and that is\r\nthe essential importance of accuracy in the illustration of specimens,\r\nespecially as regard type-specimens. It is often impossible to inspect\r\nthe original fossils which have served as types, and it is of the\r\nutmost importance that the published figures should be as faithful\r\nas possible. M. Crépin[157] of Brussels, in an article on the use of\r\nphotography in illustrating, has given some examples of the confusion\r\nand mistakes caused by imperfect drawings. It does not require a long\r\nexperience of palaeobotanical work to demonstrate the need of care in\r\nthe execution of drawings for reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                             NOMENCLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I do not think more credit is due to a man for defining a species,\r\n  than to a carpenter for making a box.”\r\n                CHARLES DARWIN, _Life and Letters_, Vol. I., p. 371.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to discuss at length the difficult and thorny question\r\nof nomenclature would be entirely out of place in an elementary book\r\non fossil plants, but there are certain important points to which it\r\nmay be well to draw attention. When a student enters the field of\r\nindependent research, he is usually but imperfectly acquainted with the\r\nprinciples of nomenclature which should be followed in palaeontological\r\nwork. After losing himself in a maze of endless synonyms and confused\r\nterminology, he recognises the desirability of adopting some definite\r\nand consistent plan in his method of naming genera and species. It is\r\nextremely probable that whatever system is made use of, it will be\r\ncalled in question by some critics as not being in strict conformity\r\nwith accepted rules. The opportunities for criticism in matters\r\nrelating to nomenclature are particularly numerous, and the critic who\r\nmay be but imperfectly familiar with the subject-matter of a scientific\r\nwork is not slow to avail himself of some supposed eccentricity on the\r\npart of the author in the manner of terminology. The true value of work\r\nmay be obscured by laying too much emphasis on the imperfections of a\r\nsomewhat heterodox nomenclature. On the other hand good systematic work\r\nis often seriously spoilt by a want of attention to generally accepted\r\nrules in naming and defining species. It is essential that those who\r\ntake up systematic research should pay attention to the necessary\r\nthough secondary question of technical description.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RULES FOR NOMENCLATURE.]\r\n\r\nIn inventing a new generic or specific name, it is well to adhere to\r\nsome definite plan as regards the form or termination of the words\r\nused. To deal with this subject in detail, or to recapitulate a\r\nseries of rules as to the best method of constructing names whether\r\ndescriptive or personal, would take us beyond the limits of a single\r\nchapter. The student should refer for guidance to such recognised rules\r\nas those drawn up by the late Mr Strickland and others at the instance\r\nof the British Association[158].\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequently the case that the same generic name has been\r\napplied to a fossil and to a recent species. Such a double use of the\r\nsame term should always be avoided as likely to lead to confusion, and\r\nas tending to admit a divorce between botany and palaeobotany.\r\n\r\nIn the course of describing a collection of fossil species, various\r\nproblems are bound to present themselves as regards the best method\r\nof dealing with certain generic or specific names. A few general\r\nsuggestions may prove of use to those who are likely to be confronted\r\nwith the intricacies of scientific and pseudoscientific terminology.\r\n\r\nIn writing the name of a species, it is important to append the name,\r\noften in an abbreviated form, of the author who first proposed the\r\naccepted specific designation. _Stigmaria ficoides_ Brongn. written\r\nin this form records the fact that Brongniart was the author of the\r\nspecific name _ficoides_. It means, moreover, that Brongniart not\r\nonly suggested the name, but that he was the first to give either a\r\nfigure or a diagnosis of this particular fossil. It is frequently\r\nthe case that a specific name is proposed for a new species, without\r\neither figures or description; such a name is usually regarded as a\r\n_nomen nudum_, and must yield priority to the name which was first\r\naccompanied by some description or illustration sufficiently accurate\r\nto afford a means of recognition. A practice which may be recommended\r\non the score of convenience is to write the name of the author of a\r\nspecies in brackets if he was not the first to use the generic as well\r\nas the specific name. _Onychiopsis Mantelli_ (Brongn.) tells us that\r\nBrongniart founded the species, but made use of some other generic\r\nname than that which is now accepted. This leads us to another point\r\nof some importance. Brongniart described this characteristic Wealden\r\nfern under the name _Sphenopteris Mantelli_; _Sphenopteris_ being one\r\nof those extremely useful provisional generic terms which are used\r\nin cases where we have no satisfactory proof of precise botanical\r\naffinity. _Sphenopteris_ stands for fern fronds having a certain habit,\r\nform of segment and venation, and in this wide sense it necessarily\r\nincludes representatives of various divisions and genera of Filices. If\r\nan example of a sphenopteroid frond is discovered with sori or spores\r\nsufficiently well preserved to enable us to determine its botanical\r\nposition within narrower limits, we may with advantage employ another\r\ngenus in place of the purely artificial form-genus which was originally\r\nchosen as a consequence of imperfect knowledge. Fronds of this Wealden\r\nfern have recently been found with well defined fertile segments\r\nhaving a form apparently identical with that which characterises the\r\npolypodiaceous genus _Onychium_. For this reason the name _Onychiopsis_\r\nhas been adopted. It is safer and more convenient to use a name which\r\ndiffers in its termination from that of the recent plant with which\r\nwe believe the fossil to be closely related. A common custom is to\r\nslightly alter the recent name by adding the termination _-opsis_ or\r\n_-ites_. There are several other provisional generic terms that are\r\noften used in Fossil Botany, and which might be advantageously chosen\r\nin many cases where the misleading resemblance of external form has\r\noften given rise to the use of a name implying affinities which cannot\r\nbe satisfactorily demonstrated.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of some of the earliest writers, in spite of their\r\nhabit of using the names of recent Flowering plants for extinct\r\nPalaeozoic species of Vascular Cryptogams, to adopt also general and\r\ncomprehensive terms. We find such a name as _Lithoxylon_ employed by\r\nLhwyd[159] in 1699 as a convenient designation for fossil wood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE RULE OF PRIORITY.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and frequently disputed questions associated\r\nwith the naming of species is that of priority. No name given to a\r\nplant in pre-Linnaean days need be considered, as our present system\r\nof nomenclature dates from the institution of the binominal system\r\nby Linnaeus. As a general rule, which it is advisable to follow, the\r\nspecific name which was first given to a plant, if accompanied by a\r\nfigure or diagnosis, should take priority over a name of later date.\r\nIf _A_ in 1850 describes a species under a certain name, and in 1860\r\n_B_ proposes a new name for the same species, either in ignorance\r\nof the older name or from disapproval of _A_’s choice of a specific\r\nterm, the later name should not be allowed to supersede _A_’s original\r\ndesignation. Such a rule is not only just to the original author, but\r\nis one which, if generally observed, would lead to less confusion and\r\nwould diminish unnecessary multiplication of specific names. Some\r\nwriters would have us conform in all cases to this rule of priority,\r\nwhich they consistently adhere to apart from all considerations of\r\nconvenience or long-established custom. There are, however, cogent\r\nreasons for maintaining a certain amount of freedom. While accepting\r\npriority as a good rule in most cases, it is unwise to allow ourselves\r\nto be too servile in our conformity to a principle which was framed in\r\nthe interests of convenience, if the strict application of the rule\r\nclearly makes for confusion and inconvenience. A name may have been\r\nin use for say eighty years, and has become perfectly familiar as\r\nthe recognised designation of a particular fossil; it is discovered,\r\nhowever, that an older name was proposed for the same species ninety\r\nyears ago, and therefore according to the priority rule, we must\r\naccustom ourselves to a new name in place of one which is thoroughly\r\nestablished by long usage. From a scientific point of view, the ideal\r\nof nomenclature is to be plain and intelligible. To prefer priority to\r\nestablished usage entails obscurity and confusion. If priority is to\r\nbe the rule which we must invariably obey in the shadowy hope that by\r\nsuch means finality in nomenclature[160] may be reached, it becomes\r\nnecessary for the student to devote no inconsiderable portion of\r\nhis time to antiquarian research, with a view to discover whether a\r\nparticular name may be stamped with the hallmark of ‘the very first.’\r\nWhile admitting the advisability of retaining as a general principle\r\nthe original generic or specific name, the extreme subservience to\r\n‘the priority craze’ without regard to convenience, would seem to lead\r\nirresistibly to the view that “botanists who waste their time over\r\npriority are like boys who, when sent on an errand, spend their time in\r\nplaying by the roadside[161].”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TERMINOLOGY AND CONVENIENCE.]\r\n\r\nThere is another point which cannot be satisfactorily settled in all\r\ncases by a rigid adherence to an arbitrary rule. How far should we\r\nregard a generic name in the sense of a mere mark or sign to denote a\r\nparticular plant, or to what extent may we accept the literal meaning\r\nof the generic term as an index of the affinity or character of the\r\nplant? If we consider the etymology of many generic names, we soon find\r\nthat they are entirely inappropriate as aids in recognizing the true\r\ntaxonomic position of the plants to which they are applied. The generic\r\nname _Calamites_ was first suggested by the supposed resemblance of\r\nthis Palaeozoic plant to recent reeds. If considered etymologically,\r\nit is merely a record of a past mistake, but it would be absurd to\r\ndiscard such a well-known name on the grounds that the genus is a\r\nVascular Cryptogam and far removed from reeds. On the other hand,\r\nthere often arise cases which present a real difficulty. The following\r\nexample conveniently illustrates two distinct points of view as regards\r\ngeneric nomenclature. In 1875 Saporta described and figured a fragment\r\nof a fossil plant from the Jurassic beds of France as _Cycadorachis\r\narmata_[162]; the name being chosen in the belief that the specimen\r\nwas part of a cycadean petiole, and there were good grounds for such\r\na view. A few years ago Mr Rufford discovered more perfect specimens,\r\nin the Wealden rocks of Sussex, clearly belonging to Saporta’s genus,\r\nand these afforded definite evidence that Saporta had been deceived by\r\nthe imperfection of the specimens as to their true botanical position.\r\nOwing to the obviously misleading name first given to this plant, I\r\nventured to substitute _Withamia_[163] for _Cycadorachis_, and chose\r\nsuch a term in preference to one denoting affinity, on account of the\r\ndifficulty of placing the plant in a definite class or family. On\r\nthe other hand, it has been objected that the original name, despite\r\nits meaningless meaning—if the expression may be used—should be\r\nretained. A friendly critic[164], in writing of the proposed change\r\nof _Cycadorachis_, urges the importance of adhering to the name which\r\nwas first applied to a genus. The same author pertinently remarks that\r\nwe can no more dispense with a nomenclature than we can dispense with\r\nlanguage. We may extend the comparison and point out that in language,\r\nas in scientific nomenclature, conciseness, clearness and convenience\r\nshould be kept in view as guiding principles.\r\n\r\nThe student must judge for himself what course to follow in each\r\ncase. While adhering as far as possible to a consistent plan, he must\r\ntake care that he does not allow his own judgment to be completely\r\nover-ridden by a blind obedience to fixed rules, which if pressed too\r\nfar may defeat their own ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =PART II. SYSTEMATIC.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THALLOPHYTA.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of the plant kingdom dealt with in the following chapters\r\nof Volume I. are taken in their natural sequence, beginning with the\r\nlowest and passing gradually to the highest groups. The list of the\r\nclasses and families included in Chapters VII.–XI. is given in the\r\ntable of contents preceding Chapter I.\r\n\r\nThallophytes are of the simplest type, but they exhibit a very wide\r\nrange as regards both the structure and differentiation of the\r\nvegetative body and the methods of reproduction. In some cases the\r\nindividual consists of a minute simple cell which multiplies by\r\ncell-division; in others the body or thallus is made up of a number of\r\nsimilar units, while in a great number of forms there is a well-marked\r\nphysiological division of labour, as expressed both in the external\r\ndivision of the thallus into distinct organs corresponding in function\r\nto the root, stem, and leaves of the higher plants, and further in the\r\nhigh degree of histological differentiation of the tissues. In other\r\nthallophytes, again, the thallus is a _coenocyte_ either unseptate or\r\nincompletely septate; that is, the individual consists of a single cell\r\ndiffering from a true plant-cell, in the stricter sense of the term, in\r\npossessing several nuclei, in other words, the thallus is divided up\r\ninto compartments by transverse septa, but each division contains more\r\nthan one nucleus. Such coenocytic plants may show well-marked external\r\ndifferentiation of the thallus into members or parts subserving\r\ndifferent functions.\r\n\r\nA similar wide range is covered by the methods of reproduction among\r\nthallophytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           I. PERIDINIALES.\r\n\r\nThe organisms included under this head are of little importance from a\r\npalaeontological point of view, but a brief reference may be made to\r\nthem as a section of the Thallophyta.\r\n\r\nThe Peridiniales include very small single-celled organisms which have\r\noften been described as occupying a position on the borderland between\r\nanimals and plants, lying on the “shadowy boundary between animal and\r\nvegetable life.” The individuals are rarely naked, more frequently\r\nthey are covered with a cellulose or mucilaginous investment which\r\nhas frequently the form of two or more minute armour-like plates of\r\na limiting membrane. The chromatophores are green, yellow, brown or\r\ncolourless. Simple division is the usual method of reproduction, but\r\nspores have been described as occurring in some species. The motile\r\nforms are provided with cilia. The Peridiniaceae, a section of the\r\nPeridiniales, are regarded as nearly related to the Diatoms.\r\n\r\nThe Peridiniales play an important rôle in the Plankton flora of the\r\nsea and freshwater lakes, and have a world-wide distribution. In the\r\nnarrative of the Challenger cruise they are described as occasionally\r\nfilling the tow-nets with a yellow coloured slime[165]. Some genera,\r\nsuch as _Ceratium_, are found in enormous numbers off the British coast.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the occurrence of fossil representatives of the\r\nPeridiniaceae reference may be made to one of two species of\r\n_Peridinium_ described by Ehrenberg in 1836. These were found in a\r\nsiliceous rock described as Cretaceous in age from Delitzsch in Saxony.\r\nA comparison of Ehrenberg’s figures of the fossil species _Peridinium\r\npyrophorum_ Ehrenb.[166], with those of the recent species _Peridinium\r\ndivergens_ Ehrenb., as given by Schütt[167] and other writers, brings\r\nout clearly the very close resemblance if not identity of the two\r\nforms. Bütschli[168] in his account of the Dinoflagellata in Bronn’s\r\n_Thier-Reich_ confirms Ehrenberg’s determination of _Peridinium\r\npyrophorum_, and points out its striking agreement with the recent\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  II. COCCOSPHERES AND RHABDOSPHERES.\r\n\r\n                   (Organisms of doubtful affinity.)\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of these minute calcareous organisms is derived from\r\nHuxley’s description of coccoliths from the Atlantic in 1857, and from\r\nthe accounts of Wallich, John Murray, and other writers. In the first\r\nvolume of the narrative of the Challenger cruise[169] and in the volume\r\non deep-sea deposits[170] these minute forms of life are figured and\r\ndescribed. In the latter volume both genera are spoken of as extremely\r\nabundant in the surface waters of the tropical and temperate regions\r\nof the open ocean, and as forming an important constituent of the\r\nGlobigerine ooze; they are said to occur entangled in the gelatinous\r\nsubstance of the Radiolarians, Diatoms, and Foraminifera, and are very\r\ncommon in the stomachs of Salps, Pteropods and other pelagic animals.\r\nRhabdospheres are rare in regions where the temperature of the water\r\nsinks below 65° F.; the Coccospheres occur in tropical and temperate\r\nlatitudes, and extend further north and south than the Rhabdospheres.\r\nAs regards their botanical position, John Murray expresses the view\r\nthat they are in all probability pelagic algae.\r\n\r\nIn the interesting memoir by Schütt on the _Pflanzenleben der\r\nHochsee_[171] there occurs a short reference to the forms described\r\nin the Challenger Reports, but they were not obtained by the staff\r\nof the Hensen Plankton Expedition and Schütt’s remarks are not based\r\ntherefore on personal observations. While admitting the existence of\r\nsuch bodies, he points out that Zoologists have referred Coccospheres\r\nand Rhabdospheres to the algae as organisms which cannot be included\r\nin any group of animals, and Schütt is unable to recognise a sufficient\r\nreason for referring them to this class of plants. It is suggested\r\nindeed that they may be purely inorganic structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.

Murray and\r\nBlackman a short notice in _Nature_ for April 1, 1897[172]. Numerous\r\nexamples of Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres were obtained by Capt.\r\nMilner of the R.M.S. Para during a voyage to Barbados by allowing\r\nthe sea water to enter the feed-pipe of the boiler through a fine\r\nmuslin net. All the forms described in the Challenger Reports were met\r\nwith, and an examination of the material by means of extremely high\r\nobjectives has confirmed the original account of the genera, and added\r\nsome points to our previous knowledge.\r\n\r\n_Coccospheres_ (fig. 25 _A_). Spherical bodies of exceedingly small\r\nsize, consisting of a central protoplasmic vesicle covered with\r\noverlapping circular calcareous scales, each of which is attached to\r\nthe minute cell by a button-like projection. The scales are frequently\r\nfound detached and are then spoken of as Coccoliths.\r\n\r\n_Rhabdospheres_ (fig. 25 _B_–_F_). Spherical bodies, extremely minute,\r\nconsisting of a single cell, on the surface of which are embedded\r\nnumerous calcareous plates bearing long blunt spines (fig. 25, _C_)\r\nor beautiful trumpet-like appendages (fig. 25, _D_–_F_). The detached\r\nplates of Rhabdospheres are known as Rhabdoliths.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the text-figures of Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres in\r\nthe Challenger Reports, the same structures are shown in samples of\r\nglobigerine ooze figured in Plate XI. of the Monograph on deep-sea\r\ndeposits. In a recent number of _Nature_ Messrs Dixon and Joly[173]\r\nhave announced the discovery of Coccoliths and Coccospheres in the\r\ncoastal waters off South County Dublin. They estimate that in one\r\nsample of water taken about three miles from the Irish coast there were\r\n200 Coccoliths in each cubic centimetre of sea water.\r\n\r\nThe interest of these calcareous bodies from a palaeobotanical point of\r\nview lies in the fact that similar forms have been recognized in the\r\nChalk and the Upper Lias. Sorby, in his memorable Address delivered\r\nbefore the Geological Society in 1879, refers to the abundance of\r\nCoccoliths in sections of chalk which he examined[174]. Rothpletz[175]\r\nhas recently recorded the occurrence of numerous Coccoliths, 5–12\r\nµ in diameter, associated with the skeleton of a horny sponge\r\n(_Phymatoderma_) of Liassic age.\r\n\r\nThe question of the nature of Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres cannot be\r\nregarded as definitely settled. It has been shown by J. Murray, and\r\nmore recently by G. Murray and V. H. Blackman, that on the solution of\r\nthe calcareous material by a weak acid there remains a small gelatinous\r\nbody apparently protoplasmic in nature. We may at least express the\r\nopinion that Schütt’s suggestion as to their being inorganic must be\r\nruled out of court. It would appear that they are extremely minute\r\nunicellular organisms characterised by a delicate calcareous armour\r\nconsisting of numerous plates or scales. We know nothing as to their\r\nlife-history, and cannot attempt to determine their affinities with\r\nany degree of certainty until further facts are before us. It is not\r\nimprobable that they are algae of an extremely minute size, and the\r\nevidence so far obtained would lead us to regard them as complete\r\nindividuals rather than the reproductive cells of some larger organism.\r\nMr George Murray is of opinion that they are certainly algae, but he\r\nconsiders that they cannot be included in any existing family. It is\r\nconceivable that they may be minute eggs or reproductive cells of\r\nanimals or plants, but on the whole the balance of probability would\r\nseem to be in favour of regarding them as autonomous organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           III. SCHIZOPHYTA.\r\n\r\n                  A. SCHIZOPHYCEAE (CYANOPHYCEAE).\r\n                  B. SCHIZOMYCETES (Bacteria).\r\n\r\nIn this group are included small single-celled plants of an extremely\r\nlow type of organisation, in which reproduction takes the form of\r\nmultiplication by simple cell-division, or the formation of spores.\r\nThe characteristic method of reproduction by division has given rise\r\nto the general term Fission-plants for this lowest sub-class in the\r\nvegetable kingdom. In many cases the members of this sub-class contain\r\nchlorophyll, and associated with it a blue-green colouring matter; such\r\nplants are classed together as the Blue-green algae, Cyanophyceae,\r\nor Schizophyceae. Others, again, are destitute of chlorophyll, and\r\nmay be conveniently designated Schizomycetes or Fission-fungi. Seeing\r\nhow close is the resemblance and relationship between the members of\r\nthe sub-class, it has been the custom to include them as two parallel\r\nseries under the general head, Schizophyta, rather than to incorporate\r\nthem among the Algae and Fungi respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n         A. SCHIZOPHYCEAE (CYANOPHYCEAE or Blue-green Algae).\r\n\r\n_Chroococcaceae._ Thallus of a single cell, the cells may be either\r\nfree, or more usually joined together in colonies enveloped by a common\r\ngelatinous matrix, formed by the mucilaginous degeneration of the outer\r\nportion of the cell-walls. Reproduction by means of simple division or\r\nresting cells.\r\n\r\n_Nostocaceae._ Thallus consists of simple or branched rows of cells in\r\nwhich special cells known as _heterocysts_ often occur. Reproduction\r\nby means of germ-plants or _hormogonia_, or by resting cells specially\r\nmodified to resist unfavourable conditions.\r\n\r\nIn both families the individuals are surrounded by a gelatinous\r\nenvelope, which in some genera assumes the form of a conspicuous\r\nand comparatively resistant sheath. Marine, freshwater, and aerial\r\nforms are represented among recent genera. Several species occur as\r\nendophytes, living in the tissues or mucilage-containing spaces in the\r\nbodies of higher plants. In addition to the frequent occurrence of\r\nblue-green algae in freshwater streams and on damp surfaces, certain\r\nforms are particularly abundant in the open sea[176], and in lakes or\r\nmeres[177] where they are the cause of what is known in some parts\r\nof the country as “the breaking of the meres” (“Fleurs d’eau”). From\r\nthe narrative of the cruise of the Challenger, we learn that the\r\nOscillariaceae are especially abundant in the surface waters of the\r\nocean. The “sea sawdust” so named by Cook’s sailors[178], and the same\r\nfloating scum collected by Darwin[179], affords an illustration of the\r\nabundance of some of these blue-green algae in the sea.\r\n\r\nAnother manner of occurrence of these plants has been recorded by\r\ndifferent writers, which is of special importance from the point of\r\nview of fossil algae. On the shores of the Great Salt Lake, Utah,\r\nthere are found numerous small oolitic calcareous bodies thrown up\r\nby the waves[180]. These are coated with the cells of _Glœocapsa_\r\nand _Glœotheca_, two genera of the Chroococcaceae. Sections of the\r\ngrains reveal the presence of the same forms in the interior of the\r\ncalcareous matrix, and it has been concluded, on good evidence that the\r\nalgae are responsible for the deposition of the carbonate of lime of\r\nthe oolitic grains. By extracting the carbonic acid which they require\r\nas a source of food, from the waters of the lake, the solvent power of\r\nthe water is decreased and carbonate of lime is thrown down. In similar\r\nwhite grains from the Red Sea[181] there is a central nucleus in the\r\nform of a grain of sand, and cells of Chroococcaceae occur in the\r\nsurrounding carbonate of lime as in the Salt Lake oolite. Prof. Cohn of\r\nBreslau in 1862 demonstrated the importance of low forms of plant life\r\nin the deposition of the Carlsbad “Sprudelstein[182].” On the bottom of\r\nLough Belvedere, near Mullingar in Ireland[183], there occur numerous\r\nspherical calcareous pebbles, of all sizes up to that of a filbert.\r\nFrom a pond in Michigan (U.S.A.)[184] similar bodies have been obtained\r\nvarying in diameter from one to three and a half inches. In the former\r\npebbles a species of _Schizothrix_, one of the Nostocaceae occurs\r\nin abundance, in the form of chains of small cells enclosed in the\r\ncharacteristic and comparatively hard tubular sheath, and associated\r\nwith _Schizothrix fasciculata_ there have been found _Nostoc_ cells and\r\nthe siliceous frustules of Diatoms. In the Michigan nodules the same\r\n_Schizothrix_ occurs, associated with _Stigonema_ and _Dichothrix_,\r\nother genera of the Nostocaceae. One of the Michigan pebbles is shown\r\nin section in fig. 32 _D_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OOLITIC STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\nThe connection between the well-known oolitic structure, characteristic\r\nof rocks of various ages in all parts of the world, and the presence\r\nof algal cells is of the greatest interest from a geological point\r\nof view. In recent years considerable attention has been paid to\r\nthe structure of oolitic rocks, and in many instances there have\r\nbeen found in the calcareous grains tubular structures suggestive of\r\nsimple cylindrical plants, which have probably been concerned in the\r\ndeposition of the carbonate of lime of which the granules consist. In\r\n1880 Messrs Nicholson and Etheridge[185] recorded the occurrence of\r\nsuch a tubular structure in calcareous nodules obtained from a rock\r\nof Ordovician age in the Girvan district of Scotland. These Authors\r\nconsidered the tubes to be those of some Rhizopod, and proposed to\r\ndesignate the fossil _Girvanella_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Girvanella_ (fig. 26).\r\n\r\nMessrs Nicholson and Etheridge defined the genus as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “Microscopic tubuli, with arenaceous or calcareous (?) walls,\r\n  flexuous or contorted, circular in section, forming loosely\r\n  compacted masses. The tubes, apparently simple cylinders, without\r\n  perforations in their sides, and destitute of internal partitions\r\n  or other structures of a similar kind.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. _Girvanella problematica_, Eth. and Nich.\r\n  Tubules of _Girvanella_ lying in various positions and surrounding\r\n  an inorganic ‘nucleus’ or centre. From a section of Wenlock\r\n  limestone, May Hill. × 65]\r\n\r\nSince this diagnosis was published very many examples of similar\r\ntubular fossils have been described by several writers in rocks from\r\nwidely separated geological horizons. The accompanying sketch (Fig.\r\n26), drawn from a micro-photograph kindly lent to me by Mr Wethered\r\nof Cheltenham, who has made oolitic grains a special subject of\r\ncareful investigation, affords a good example of the occurrence of\r\nsuch tubular structures in an oolitic grain of Silurian age from\r\nthe Wenlock limestone of May Hill, Gloucestershire[186]. In the\r\ncentre is a crystalline core or nucleus round which the tubules have\r\ngrown, and presumably they had an important share in the deposition\r\nof the calcareous substance. The nature of _Girvanella_, and still\r\nmore its exact position in the organic world, is quite uncertain;\r\nit is mentioned rather as _à propos_ of the association of recent\r\nCyanophyceae with oolitic structure, than as a well-defined genus of\r\nfossil algae.\r\n\r\nIn the typo description of the calcareous nodules from Michigan, Murray\r\nspeaks of the _Schizothrix_ filaments at the surface of the pebbles\r\nas fairly intact, while nearer the centre only sheaths were met with.\r\nIt is conceivable that in some of the tubular structures referred to\r\n_Girvanella_ we have the mineralised sheaths of a fossil Cyanophyceous\r\ngenus[187]. The organic nature of these tubules has been a matter\r\nof dispute, but we may probably assume with safety that in some at\r\nleast of the fossil oolitic grains there are distinct traces of some\r\nsimple organism which was in all likelihood a plant. Some authors\r\nhave suggested that _Girvanella_ is a calcareous alga which should be\r\nincluded in the family Siphoneae[188]. As a matter of fact we must\r\nbe content for the present to leave its precise nature as still _sub\r\njudice_, and while regarding it as probably an alga, we may venture\r\nto consider it more fittingly discussed under the Schizophyta than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nWethered[189] would go so far as to refer oolitic structure in general\r\nto an organic origin. While admitting that a Girvanella-like structure\r\nhas been very frequently met with in oolitic rocks, it would be unwise\r\nto adopt so far-reaching a conclusion. It is at least premature to\r\nrefer the formation of all oolitic structure to algal agency, and the\r\nevidence adduced is by no means convincing in every case. The discovery\r\nof _Girvanella_ and allied forms in rocks from the Cambrian[190],\r\nOrdovician, Silurian, Carboniferous, Jurassic and other systems is a\r\nstriking fact, and lends support to the view that oolitic structure\r\nis in many cases intimately associated with the presence of a simple\r\ntubular organism. Among recent algae we find different genera, and\r\nrepresentatives of different families, growing in such a manner and\r\nunder such circumstances as are favourable to the formation of a\r\nball-like mass of algal threads, which may or may not be encrusted\r\nwith carbonate of lime. Similarly as regards oolitic grains of various\r\nsizes, and the occurrence in rocks of calcareous nodules, the tubular\r\nstructure is not always of precisely the same type, and cannot always\r\nbe included under the genus _Girvanella_.\r\n\r\nSeveral observers have recorded the occurrence of low forms of\r\nplant-life in the waters of thermal springs. It has been already\r\nmentioned that Cohn described the occurrence of simple plants in the\r\nwarm Carlsbad Springs, and fission-plants of various types have been\r\ndiscovered in the thermal waters of Iceland, the Azores[191], New\r\nZealand, the Yellowstone Park, Japan, India, and numerous other places.\r\n\r\nA few years ago Mr Weed, of the geological survey of the United States,\r\npublished an interesting account of the formation of calcareous\r\ntravertine and siliceous sinter in the Yellowstone Park district[192].\r\nThis author emphasizes the important rôle of certain forms of plants\r\nin the building up of the calcareous and siliceous material. Among\r\nother forms of frequent occurrence, _Calothrix gypsophila_ and a\r\nspecies _Leptothrix_ are mentioned, the former being a member of\r\nthe Nostocaceae, allied to _Rivularia_, and the latter a genus of\r\nSchizomycetes. In many of the springs there are found masses of algal\r\njelly like those previously described by Cohn in the Carlsbad waters.\r\nSections of such dried jelly showed a number of interlaced filaments\r\nwith glassy silica between them. Weed refers to the occurrence of small\r\ngritty particles in this mucilaginous material. These are calcareous\r\noolitic granules which are eventually cemented together into a compact\r\nand firm mass of travertine by the continued deposition of carbonate\r\nof lime. The presence of the plant filaments is often difficult to\r\nrecognise in the “leathery sheet of tough gelatinous material,” or in\r\n“the skeins of delicate white filaments” which make up the travertine\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BORINGS IN SHELLS.]\r\n\r\nUnder the head of _Cyanophyceae_, mention should be made of the recent\r\ngenus _Hyella_[193], which occurs as a perforating or boring alga in\r\nthe calcareous shells of molluscs. On dissolving the carbonate of\r\nlime of shells perforated by this alga, the latter is isolated and\r\nappears to consist of rows of small cells, with possibly some sporangia\r\ncontaining spores. Other boring algae have been recorded among the\r\nChlorophyceae, and recently a member of the Rhodophyceae[194] has been\r\nfound living in the substance of calcareous shells. Such examples are\r\nworthy of note in view of the not infrequent occurrence of fossil\r\ncorals, shells and fish-scales, which have evidently been bored by an\r\norganism resembling in form and manner of occurrence these recent algal\r\nborers.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of small ramifying tubes in recent and fossil corals,\r\nfish-scales, and bones was long ago pointed out by Quekett[195],\r\nKölliker[196], Rose[197] and other writers[198]. These narrow tubular\r\ncavities have generally been attributed to the boring action of\r\nsome parasitic organism, either a fungus or an alga. In 1876 Duncan\r\npublished two important papers[199] dealing with the occurrence of\r\nsuch tubes in recent corals, as well as in the calcareous skeleton\r\nof _Calceolina_, _Goniophyllum_ and other Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and\r\nTertiary species of corals. This writer attributed the formation of the\r\ncavities in the case of the fossil species to the action of a fungus\r\nwhich he named _Palaeachlya perforans_, and considered as very nearly\r\nrelated to _Achlya penetrans_ found in the “dense sclerenchyma” of\r\nrecent corals. In fig. 27 A. is reproduced one of the drawings given\r\nby Rose[200] in his paper published in 1855; it shows a section of a\r\nfish-scale from the Kimeridge clay which has been attacked by a boring\r\norganism. Rose attributes the dichotomously branched canals to some\r\n“infusorial parasite.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. A, Section of a fish-scale from the Kimeridge\r\n  Clay, showing branched canals, made by a boring organism, × 85.\r\n  B, Section of a Solen shell, penetrated in all directions by the\r\n  boring thallus of _Ostracoblabe_ (a fungus?), × 330.

Bornet and Flahault on perforating algae\r\na full description is given of various boring forms belonging to the\r\nChlorophyceae and the Cyanophyceae[201]. The canals which these algae\r\nproduce in calcareous shells and other hard substances are of the same\r\ntype as those previously described in fossil corals, fish-scales and\r\nbones. In dealing with living perforating Thallophytes the colour and\r\nother cell-contents often enable us to distinguish between algae and\r\nfungi, but in fossil specimens such tests cannot be applied. The fossil\r\ntubular borings may or may not show traces of the transverse septa\r\nand reproductive cells; it is often the case that no trace of the\r\norganism has been left, but only the canals by which it penetrated the\r\ncalcareous or bony skeleton. In some of the examples of _Palaeachlya_\r\nfigured by Duncan there appear to be numerous spores in some of the\r\nsections, but it is generally a very difficult and often an impossible\r\ntask to discriminate between the borings of fungi and algae in fossil\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nFig. 27 B, which is copied from one of Bornet and Flahault’s drawings,\r\nrepresents a piece of Solen shell riddled with small canals made by\r\nthe organism which has been named by the French authors _Ostracoblabe\r\nimplexa_, and regarded by them as a fungus. Fig. 27 C represents a\r\nsmall piece of the vegetative body of _Ostracoblabe_ obtained from a\r\ndecalcified shell. In endeavouring to determine the organism which\r\nhas produced borings in fossil corals or shells, it must be borne in\r\nmind that some forms of canals or passages may have been the work of\r\nperforating sponges, but these are larger in diameter than those made\r\nby algae or fungi. By some writers[202] the tubular cavities in shells\r\nhave been referred to true algae, but others consider them to be of\r\nfungal origin.\r\n\r\nAs an example of a fossil alga referred to the Cyanophyceae, the genus\r\n_Zonatrichites_[203] may be quoted. Bornemann, who first described the\r\nspecimens, points out the close resemblance in habit to some members of\r\nthe recent Rivulariaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Zonatrichites._\r\n\r\nThe author of the genus defines it as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “A calcareous alga, with radially arranged filaments, forming\r\n  hemispherical or kidney-shaped layers, growing on or enclosing\r\n  other bodies. Parallel or concentric zones are seen in\r\n  cross-section, formed by the periodic growth of the alga, the\r\n  older and dead layers serving as a foundation on which the young\r\n  filaments grow in radially arranged groups.”\r\n\r\nThe nodules which are apparently formed by species of this genus occur\r\nin various sizes and shapes; Bornemann describes one hemispherical mass\r\n8 cm. broad and 4 cm. thick. In some cases the organism has given rise\r\nto oolitic spherules, which in radial section exhibit the branched\r\ntubular cells spreading in fan-shaped groups from the centre of the\r\noolitic grain. The section parallel to the surface of a nodule presents\r\nthe appearance of a number of circular or elliptical tubes cut across\r\ntransversely or more or less obliquely. The resemblance between the\r\nfossil and a specimen of the recent species _Zonatrichia calcivora_\r\nBraun, is certainly very close, but it is very difficult, in the\r\nabsence of material exhibiting more detailed structure than is shown in\r\nthe specimens described by Bornemann, to decide with any certainty the\r\ntrue position of the fossil. The figures do not enable us to recognise\r\nany trace of cells in the radiating tubes. It is possible that we\r\nhave in _Zonatrichites_ an example of a Cyanophyceous genus in which\r\nonly the sheaths of the filaments have been preserved. In any case it\r\nis probable that this Mesozoic species affords another instance of a\r\nfossil alga which has been responsible for certain oolitic or other\r\nstructures in limestone rocks.\r\n\r\nThe species described by Bornemann was obtained from a Breccia near\r\nLissau in Silesia, of Keuper age.\r\n\r\nM. Renault has recently described certain minute structures in\r\na Palaeozoic coprolite to which he gives the name _Gloioconis\r\nBorneti_[204], and which he regards as a Permian gelatinous alga\r\nsimilar to the well-known recent genus _Glœocapsa_. The appearances\r\nrevealed in a section of the coprolite are interpreted by this author\r\nas a collection of small colonies of a unicellular gelatinous alga in\r\nvarious stages of development. Renault’s figure shows a spherical group\r\nof faintly outlined and cloudy bodies, most of which include one or two\r\nsmall dark spots. The latter are regarded as the cells of the alga, and\r\nthe surrounding cloudy substance is described as the gelatinous sheath.\r\nThe absence of a nucleus in these extremely minute fossil cells (8–10\r\nµ in diameter) is referred to as an argument in favour of referring\r\nthe organism to the Cyanophyceae rather than to the Chlorophyceae. It\r\nis possible that the ill-defined structure described by Renault may be\r\na petrified alga, but there is not sufficient evidence to warrant a\r\ndecided opinion; the absence of nuclei can hardly be taken seriously\r\nin such a case as this as an argument in favour of the Cyanophyceae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CYANOPHYCEAE.]\r\n\r\nAlthough our exact knowledge of fossil Cyanophyceae is extremely small,\r\nit is probable that such simple forms of plants existed in abundance\r\nduring the past ages in the earth’s history. Several writers have\r\nexpressed the opinion that the blue-green algae may be taken as the\r\nmodern representatives of those earliest plants which first existed\r\non an archaean land-surface. The living species possess the power of\r\nresisting unfavourable conditions in a marked degree, and are able\r\nto adapt themselves to very different surroundings. Their occurrence\r\nin hot springs proves them capable of living under conditions which\r\nare fatal to most plants, and suggests the possibility of their\r\noccurrence in the heated waters which probably constituted the medium\r\nin which vegetable life began. An interesting example of the growth of\r\nblue-green algae under unfavourable conditions was recorded in 1886 by\r\nDr Treub[205] of the Buitenzorg Gardens, Java. In 1883 a considerable\r\npart of the island Krakatoa, situated in the Straits of Sunda, between\r\nSumatra and Java, was entirely destroyed by a terrific volcanic\r\nexplosion. What remained had been reduced to a lifeless mass of hot\r\nvolcanic ashes. Three years later, Treub visited the island, and found\r\nthat several plants had already established themselves on the volcanic\r\nrocks. Various ferns and flowering plants were recorded in Treub’s\r\ndescription of this newly established flora. It seemed that the barren\r\nrocky surface had been prepared for the more highly organised plants by\r\nthe action of certain forms of Cyanophyceae, which were able to live\r\nunder conditions which would be fatal to more complex types.\r\n\r\nIn the petrified tissues of fossil plants there are occasionally\r\nfound small spherical vesicles, with delicate limiting membranes, in\r\nthe cavities of parenchymatous cells or in the elements of vascular\r\ntissue. Some of these spherical inclusions have been described as\r\npossibly simple forms of endophytic algae[206], such as we are now\r\nfamiliar with in species of the Cyanophyceae and other algae. So far,\r\nhowever, no recorded instance of such fossil endophytic algae is\r\nentirely satisfactory. Some of the cells figured by Williamson as\r\npossibly algae, endophytic in the tissues of Coal-Measure plants, are\r\nno doubt thin-walled vesicles which formed part of a highly vacuolated\r\ncell-contents. Examples of such vesicles in living and fossil cells are\r\nshown in fig. 42. The fact that the contents of living plant tissues\r\nhave been erroneously described as endophytic organisms, should serve\r\nas a warning against describing fossil endophytes without the test of\r\ngood evidence to support them.\r\n\r\nThe description of a fossil _Nostoc_ by the late Prof. Heer[207] from\r\nthe Tertiary rocks of Switzerland cannot be accepted as a trustworthy\r\nexample of a fossil plant, much less of a genus of recent algae. The\r\napplication of recent generic names to fossils which are possibly not\r\neven organic must do more harm than good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     B. SCHIZOMYCETES (Bacteria).\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to draw a sharp line between the two subdivisions of\r\nthe Schizophyta. The so-called Fission-Fungi or Bacteria differ from\r\nthe Schizophyceae or Fission-Algae in the cell-contents being either\r\ncolourless, blood-red or green, but never blue-green. We may regard\r\nthe Bacteria, generally, as the lowest forms of plants; they are\r\nextremely simple organisms which have been derived from some primitive\r\ntypes which possessed the power of independent existence and contained\r\nchlorophyll—that important substance which enables a plant to obtain\r\nits carbon first-hand from the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBacteria may be briefly described as single-celled plants, and as de\r\nBary suggested comparable in shape to a billiard ball, a lead pencil or\r\na corkscrew[208]. A single spherical or cylindrical cell measures about\r\n1 µ in diameter[209]. They occur either singly or in filaments, or as\r\nmasses of various shapes consisting of numberless bacterial cells. The\r\nnature and manner of life of Bacteria, and their extraordinary power\r\nof successfully resisting the most unfavourable conditions, render it\r\nprobable that they constitute an extremely ancient group of organisms.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful perfection of preservation of many fossil plants enables\r\nus to investigate the contents of petrified cells and to examine in\r\nminutest detail the histology of extinct plants. To those who are\r\nfamiliar with the possibilities of microscopical research as applied to\r\nsilicified and calcified fossil tissues, it is by no means incredible\r\nthat evidence has been detected of the existence of Bacteria as far\r\nback in the history of the earth as the Carboniferous and Devonian\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nWere there no trustworthy records of the occurrence of Bacteria in\r\nPalaeozoic times, it would still be a natural supposition that these\r\nubiquitous organisms must have been abundantly represented. It has\r\nbeen suggested as a probable conclusion that some forms of Bacteria,\r\nwhich produced chemical changes in the soil necessary for the nutrition\r\nof plants, must have existed contemporaneously with the oldest\r\nvegetation[210].\r\n\r\nThe paper-coal of Toula, which in some places reaches a thickness of 20\r\ncm., is a plant-bed of exceptional interest. It differs from ordinary\r\ncoal in being made up of numberless thin brown-papery sheets associated\r\nwith a darker coloured substance largely composed of ulmic acid. Prof.\r\nZeiller[211], in an interesting account of the papery layers, has\r\nshown that they consist of the cuticles of a Lepidodendroid plant,\r\n_Bothrodendron_. An examination of a piece of one of the sheets at\r\nonce reveals the existence of a regular network of which the walls of\r\nthe meshes are the outlines of the epidermal cells, the meshes being\r\nbridged across by a thin light brown membrane which represents the\r\nlayer of cuticularised cell-wall of each epidermal cell. At regular\r\nintervals and disposed in a spiral arrangement, we find small gaps\r\nin the papery cuticle which mark the position of the _Bothrodendron_\r\nleaves. These Palaeozoic cuticles are not petrified; they are only\r\nslightly altered, and have retained the power of swelling in water,\r\nbeing able to take up stains like recent tissues. It may reasonably\r\nbe assumed that the persistent cuticles owe their preservation to a\r\ngreater power of resistance to destructive agents than was possessed\r\nby the other tissues of the plant. It is by no means unlikely, as\r\nRenault[212] has recently suggested, that as the _Bothrodendron_\r\nstem-fragments lay in the swamps or marshes the tissues were gradually\r\neaten away by Bacteria, but the cuticles successfully resisted the\r\nattacks of the bacterial saprophytes. The same observer has described\r\nwhat he regards as the actual organism which effected this wholesale\r\ndestruction, under the name _Micrococcus Zeilleri_. He finds, after\r\ntreating the cuticles with ammonia to remove the ulmic acid, that there\r\noccur numerous minute spherical bodies, each surrounded by a thin\r\nenvelope, either singly or in groups on the surface of the cuticular\r\nmembrane. These vary in size from ·5µ to 1µ in diameter. I have not\r\nbeen able to detect any satisfactory proof of such _Micrococci_ in\r\nspecimens of the paper-coal which were treated according to Renault’s\r\nmethod, but it is extremely probable that this unusual method of\r\npreservation of stem-cuticles is the result of selective bacterial\r\naction.\r\n\r\nRenault believes that some of the minute spherulitic structures which\r\nare seen in sections of decayed tissues of Palaeozoic plants owe their\r\norigin, in part, to the ravages of bacteria. The disorganisation of\r\nparenchymatous cells gives rise to a gelatinous substance in which\r\nneedle-like crystals of silica may be deposited, from a siliceous\r\nsolution, in a matrix which has resulted from bacterial activity. In\r\nsome of the sections of tissues figured by Renault[213] the outlines of\r\na few cells are still indicated by fragments of the partially decayed\r\nwall, while in other cells the walls have been completely destroyed by\r\nBacteria of which some are preserved in the centre of the cell-area,\r\nforming a kind of nucleus to the siliceous spherulites.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BACILLI.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _Micrococcus_ described by Renault from the Toula\r\npaper-coal, there are a host of other forms which have been minutely\r\ndiagnosed and figured by Profs. Renault and Bertrand[214]. These\r\nauthors have discovered what they believe to be well-defined species of\r\n_Micrococcus_ and _Bacillus_ ranging in age from Devonian to Jurassic.\r\nThe material which has afforded the somewhat startling results of\r\ntheir investigations consists partly of the coprolites of reptiles and\r\nfishes, and of silicified and calcified plant tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Bacillus Permicus._ Ren. and Bert.[215] (Fig. 28 B.)\r\n\r\nThis _Bacillus_, which was discovered in sections of a Permian\r\ncoprolite from Central France, has the form of cylindrical rods\r\n12–14µ in length, and 1·3–1·5µ broad, rounded at each end. The rods\r\noccur either singly or occasionally, two or three individuals are\r\njoined end to end. Fig. 28 B represents a piece of one of Renault and\r\nBertrand’s sections; the small rods are clearly seen lying in various\r\ndirections in the homogeneous matrix of the coprolite. Each individual\r\nis said to be surrounded by an extremely minute empty space ·4µ in\r\nwidth, originally occupied by the Bacillus membrane, the central\r\nrod representing the mineralised cell-contents. In this example the\r\npetrifying substance was probably derived from the phosphate of calcium\r\nof bones which were attacked by Bacteria. I am indebted to Prof.\r\nRenault for an opportunity of examining specimens of this and other\r\nfossil Bacteria, and in this particular case there is undoubtedly\r\nstrong evidence in favour of the author’s determination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. A, _Bacillus Tieghemi_ Ren. and _Micrococcus\r\n  Guignardi_ Ren. B, _Bacillus Permicus_ Ren. (After Renault.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Bacillus Tieghemi_ Ren.[216] and _Micrococcus Guignardi_ Ren.[217]\r\n                             (Fig. 28 A.)\r\n\r\nRenault has given the name _Bacillus Tieghemi_ to certain minute rods\r\n6–10µ, in length, and 2·2–3·8µ broad, often containing a dark coloured\r\nspherical spore-like body 2µ in diameter, which have been found in the\r\ntissues of a Coal-Measure plant.\r\n\r\nThe name _Micrococcus Guignardi_ has been applied to more or less\r\nspherical bodies 2·2µ in diameter, also met with in silicified plants.\r\n\r\nA portion of one of Renault’s figures is reproduced in Fig. 28 A. The\r\nfaint and broken lines mark the position of the middle lamellae of\r\nparenchymatous cells from the pith of a Calamite. The tissue has been\r\nalmost completely destroyed, but the more resistant middle lamellae\r\nhave been partially preserved. The short and broad rods represent what\r\nRenault terms _Bacillus Tieghemi_; the small circle in the middle of\r\nsome of these being referred to as a spore, and in one specimen shown\r\nin the figure, the second rod at right angles to the first is described\r\nas a small daughter-Bacillus formed by the germination of the central\r\nspore.\r\n\r\nThe isolated circles in the figure are referred to _Micrococcus_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL BACTERIA.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to give an account of the numerous examples of\r\n_Micrococci_ and _Bacilli_ described by Renault from Devonian,\r\nCarboniferous, Permian and Jurassic rocks. We may, however, in a few\r\nwords consider the general question of the existence and possible\r\ndetermination of fossil Bacteria.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Prof. Van Tieghem[218] of Paris drew attention to the method\r\nof operation and plan of attack of _Bacillus amylobacter_ as a\r\ndestructive agent in the decay of plant débris in water. He was able\r\nto follow the gradual disorganisation of the tissues and the various\r\nsteps in the ‘butyric fermentation’ effected by this _Bacterium_.\r\nSimilarly the same author[219] was able to detect the action of an\r\nallied organism in some silicified tissues from the Carboniferous\r\nnodules of Grand-Croix, a well-known locality for petrified plants near\r\nSaint-Étienne. He recognised also the traces of the _Bacillus_ itself\r\nin the partially destroyed plant tissues. The Palaeozoic Bacteria\r\nmade use of some cellulose-dissolving ferment of which the action is\r\nclearly demonstrated in sections of silicified tissues. Many of the\r\nphenomena described by Renault and Bertrand as due to similar Bacterial\r\naction, afford additional evidence that the gradual disorganisation of\r\nvegetable tissues was effected in precisely the same manner as at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we have I believe trustworthy examples of the Bacteria\r\nthemselves, both in coprolites and plant-tissues, but it is more\r\nthan probable that some of the recorded examples are not of any\r\nscientific value. The examination of petrified tissues under the\r\nhigher powers of a microscope often reveals the existence of numerous\r\nspherical particles and rod-like bodies which agree in shape with\r\n_Micrococci_ or _Bacilli_. Minute crystals of mineral substances may\r\noccur in the siliceous or calcareous matrix of a petrified plant\r\nwhich simulate minute organic forms. Vogelsang[220] in his important\r\nwork _die Krystalliten_ has thrown considerable light on the ontogeny\r\nof crystals, and the minute globulites and other forms of incipient\r\ncrystallisation might well be mistaken for Bacterial cells. Granting,\r\nhowever, that we have satisfactory evidence, both direct and indirect,\r\nthat some forms of Bacteria lived in the decaying tissues of Palaeozoic\r\nplants, and in the intestines of reptiles and other animals, we cannot\r\nsafely proceed to specific diagnoses and determinations[221].\r\n\r\nRenault has pointed out that fossil Bacteria may often be more readily\r\ndetected than living forms owing to the presence of a brown ulmic\r\nsubstance which results from the carbonisation of the protoplasm. He\r\nis forced to admit, however, that such diagnostic characters as are\r\nobtained by Bacteriologists by means of cultures cannot be utilised\r\nwhen we are dealing with fossil examples! We are told that “Partout où\r\nnous avons cherché des Bacteriaceés, nous en avons rencontré.”[222]\r\nThis indeed is the danger; an extended examination of fossil sections\r\nunder an immersion-lens must almost inevitably lead to the discovery\r\nof minute bodies of a more or less spherical form which _might_ be\r\n_Micrococci_. To measure, and name such bodies as definite species of\r\n_Micrococci_ is, I believe, but wasted energy and an attempt to compass\r\nthe impossible.\r\n\r\nSpecialists tell us that the accurate determination of species of\r\nrecent Bacteria is practically hopeless: may we not reasonably conclude\r\nthat the attempt to specifically diagnose fossil forms is absolutely\r\nhopeless? “The imagination of man is naturally sublime, delighted with\r\nwhatever is remote and extraordinary—”, but it is to be deplored if the\r\nfascination of fossil bacteriology is allowed to warp sound scientific\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IV. ALGAE.\r\n\r\n                      A. DIATOMACEAE. (Diatoms.)\r\n                      B. CHLOROPHYCEAE. (Green algae.)\r\n                      C. RHODOPHYCEAE. (Red algae.)\r\n                      D. PHAEOPHYCEAE. (Brown algae.)\r\n\r\nThe presence of chlorophyll is one common characteristic of the\r\nnumerous plants included in the Algae. The generally adopted\r\nclassification rests in part on an artificial distinction, namely the\r\nprevailing colour of the plant.\r\n\r\nIt must be definitely admitted, at the outset, that palaeobotany has\r\nso far afforded extremely little trustworthy information as to the\r\npast history of algae. Were we to measure the importance of the\r\ngeological history of these plants by the number of recorded fossil\r\nspecies, we should arrive at a totally wrong and misleading estimate.\r\nBy far the greater number of the supposed fossil algae have no claim\r\nto be regarded as authentic records of this class of Thallophytes. It\r\nhas been justly said that palaeontologists have been in the habit of\r\nreferring to algae such impressions or markings on rocks as cannot well\r\nbe included in any other group. “A fossil alga,” has often been the\r\n_dernier ressort_ of the doubtful student.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LARGE SEAWEEDS.]\r\n\r\nBefore discussing our knowledge, or rather lack of knowledge, of\r\nfossil algae at greater length, it will be well to briefly consider\r\nthe manner of occurrence and botanical nature of existing forms. In\r\nthe sea and in fresh water, as well as in damp places and even in\r\nsituations subject to periods of drought, algae occur in abundance in\r\nall parts of the world. We find them attaining full development and\r\nreproducing themselves at a temperature of −1° C. in the Arctic Seas,\r\nand again living in enormous numbers in the waters of thermal springs.\r\nAround the coast-line of land areas, and on the floor of shallow seas\r\nalgae exhibit a remarkable wealth of form and luxuriance of growth.\r\nAs regards habit and structure, there is every gradation from algae\r\nin which the whole individual consists of a thin-walled unseptate\r\nvesicle, to those in which the thallus attains a length unsurpassed by\r\nany other plant, and of which the anatomical features clearly express\r\na well-marked physiological division of labour such as occurs in the\r\nhighest plants.\r\n\r\nThe large and leathery seaweeds which flourish in the extreme northern\r\nand southern seas are plants which it is reasonable to suppose might\r\nwell have left traces of their existence in ancient sediments. Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, in his account of the Antarctic flora[223], investigated\r\nduring Sir James Ross’s voyage in H.M. ships Erebus and Terror, has\r\ngiven an exceedingly interesting description of the gigantic brown\r\nseaweeds of southern latitudes. The trunks are described as usually\r\n5–10 feet long, and as thick as a human thigh, dividing towards the\r\nsummit into numerous pendulous branches which are again broken up into\r\nsprays with linear ‘leaves.’ Hooker records how a captain of a brig\r\nemployed his crew for two bitterly cold days in collecting _Lessonia_\r\nstems which had been washed up on the beach, thinking they were trunks\r\nof trees fit for burning. On our own coasts we are familiar with the\r\ncommon _Laminaria_, the large brown seaweed with long and strap-shaped\r\nor digitate fronds which grows on the rocks below low-tide level. The\r\nfrond passes downwards into a thick and tough stipe firmly attached to\r\nthe ground by special holdfasts. A transverse section of the stalk of\r\na fairly old plant presents an appearance not unlike that of a section\r\nof a woody plant. In the centre there is a well-defined axial region\r\nor pith consisting of thick walled, long and narrow tubes pursuing a\r\ngenerally vertical though irregular course, and embedded in a matrix\r\nof gelatinous substance derived from the mucilaginous degeneration\r\nof the outer portions of the cell-walls. The greater part of such a\r\nsection consists, however, of regularly disposed rows of cells which\r\nhave obviously been formed by the activity of a zone of dividing or\r\nmeristematic elements. The occurrence of distinct concentric rings in\r\nthis secondary tissue clearly points to some periodicity of growth\r\nwhich is expressed by the alternation of narrow and broader cells. In\r\nthe Antarctic genus _Lessonia_, the stem reaches a girth equal to that\r\nof a man’s thigh, and in structure it agrees closely with the smaller\r\nstem of _Laminaria_. In these large algal stems, the cells are not\r\nlignified as in woody plants, and in longitudinal section they have\r\nfor the most part the form of somewhat elongated parenchyma, differing\r\nwidely in appearance from the tracheids or vessels of woody plants. At\r\nthe periphery of the _Laminaria_ stem, represented in fig. 29, there\r\noccur numerous and comparatively large mucilage ducts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. A, Transverse section of the stipe of a\r\n  _Laminaria_, slightly enlarged. B, A small piece of the tissue\r\n  between the central ‘pith’ and ‘cortex’ showing the radially\r\n  disposed secondary elements more highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn certain algae of different families the thallus is encrusted with\r\ncarbonate of lime, and is thus rendered much more resistant. The\r\nDiatoms, on the other hand, possess still more durable siliceous tests\r\nwhich are particularly well adapted to resist the solvent action of\r\nwater and other agents of destruction. It is these calcareous and\r\nsiliceous forms which supply the greater part of the trustworthy data\r\nfurnished by fossil algae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCARCITY OF FOSSIL ALGAE.]\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider some of the causes to which we may attribute\r\nthe scarcity of fossil algae, and the possible sources of error which\r\nbeset any attempt to describe or assign names to impressions and casts\r\nsimulating algal forms.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the delicate nature of algal cells is a serious\r\nobstacle to fossilisation. Even in plants in which the woody stems have\r\nbeen preserved by a siliceous or calcareous solution, we frequently\r\nfind the more delicate cells represented by a mass of crystalline\r\nmatter without any trace of the cell-walls being preserved. In such\r\nplants as algae, where the cell-walls are not lignified, but consist of\r\ncellulose or some special form of cellulose, which readily breaks down\r\ninto a mucilaginous product, the tissues have but a small chance of\r\nwithstanding the wear and tear of fossilisation.\r\n\r\nThe danger of relying on external form as a means of recognition is\r\nespecially patent in the case of those numerous markings or impressions\r\nfrequently met with on rocks, and which resemble in outline the\r\nthallus of recent algae. Among animals, such as certain Polyzoa, the\r\nflat branching body of various algae is closely simulated, and in\r\nother plants, such as the frondose liverworts, the same thalloid and\r\nbranched form of body is again met with. Some of the much dissected\r\n_Aphlebia_ leaves of ferns (e.g. _Rhacophyllum_ species) bear a\r\nstriking resemblance to fossil algae; and numerous other examples might\r\nbe quoted. In palaeobotanical literature we find a host of names, such\r\nas _Chondrites_, _Fucoides_[224], _Caulerpites_ and others applied to\r\nindefinite and indistinct surface markings which happen to resemble in\r\nshape certain of the better known genera of recent seaweeds.\r\n\r\nThe close parallelism in outward form displayed by different genera\r\nand families of algae is in itself sufficient argument against the use\r\nof recent generic names for fossils of which the algal nature is often\r\nmore than doubtful. Were external form to be accepted as a trustworthy\r\nguide, in the absence of internal structure and reproductive organs,\r\nsuch a genus as _Caulerpa_[225] would afford material for numerous\r\ngeneric designations. A comparison of the different species of this\r\nSiphoneous green alga brings out very clearly the exceedingly protean\r\nnature of this interesting genus, and serves as one instance among\r\nmany of the small taxonomic value which can be attached to external\r\nconfiguration. _Caulerpa pusilla_ Mart. and Her., _C. taxifolia_\r\n(Vahl.), _C. plumaris_ Forsk., _C. abies-marina_ J. Ag., _C.\r\nericifolia_ (Turn.), _C. hypnoides_ (R. Br.), _C. cactoides_ (Turn.),\r\n_C. scalpelli formis_ (R. Br.), and others clearly illustrate the\r\nalmost endless variety of form exhibited by the species of a single\r\ngenus of algae. We constantly find in the several classes of plants\r\na repetition of the same form either in the whole or in the separate\r\nmembers of the vegetative body, and but a slight acquaintance with\r\nplant types should lead us to use the test of external resemblance\r\nwith the greatest possible caution. To emphasize this danger may seem\r\nmerely the needless reiteration of a self-evident fact, but there is,\r\nperhaps, no source of error which has been more responsible for the\r\ncreation of numerous worthless species among fossil plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. 1.

Tracks made by _Goniada maculata_, a Polychaet (after\r\n  Nathorst). 4. Burrow of an insect. 4_a_. Section of the gallery\r\n  (after Zeiller).]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another category of impressions and casts of common\r\noccurrence in sedimentary rocks which requires a brief notice. Very\r\nmany of the fossil algae described in text-books and palaeobotanical\r\nmemoirs have been shown to be of animal origin, and to be merely\r\nthe casts of tracks and burrows. A few examples will best serve to\r\nillustrate the identity of many of the fossils referred to algae with\r\nanimal trails and with impressions produced by inorganic agency.\r\n\r\nDr Nathorst of Stockholm has done more than any other worker to\r\ndemonstrate the true nature of many of the species of _Chondrites_,\r\n_Cruziana_, _Spirophyton_, _Eophyton_, and numerous other genera. In\r\n1867 there were discovered in certain Cambrian beds of Vestrogothia,\r\nlong convex and furrowed structures in sandstone rocks which were\r\ndescribed as the remains of some comparatively highly organised plant,\r\nand described under the generic name _Eophyton_[226]. By many authors\r\nthese fossils have been referred to algae, but Nathorst has shown that\r\nthe frond of an alga trailed along the surface of soft plaster of Paris\r\nproduces a finely furrowed groove (fig. 30, 2) which would afford a\r\ncast similar to that of _Eophyton_. The same author has also adduced\r\ngood reasons for believing that the Eophytons of Cambrian rocks may\r\nrepresent the trails made by the tentacles of a _Medusa_ having a habit\r\nsimilar to that of _Polydonia frondosa_ Ag. Impressions of _Medusae_\r\nhave been described by Nathorst from the beds in which _Eophyton_\r\noccurs; and the specimens in the Stockholm Museum afford a remarkable\r\ninstance of the rare preservation of a soft-bodied organism[227]. By\r\nallowing various animals to crawl over a soft-prepared surface it is\r\npossible to obtain moulds and casts which suggest in a striking manner\r\nthe branched thallus of an alga. The tracks of the Polychaet, _Goniada\r\nmaculata_ Örstd.[228], one of the Glyceridae, are always branched and\r\nvery algal-like in form (fig. 30, 3). Many of the so-called fossil\r\nalgae are undoubtedly mere tracks or trails of this type. In the\r\nfossil-plant gallery of the British Museum there are several specimens\r\nof small branched casts, clearly marked as whitish fossils on a dark\r\ngrey rock of Lower Eocene age from Bognor; these were described by\r\nMantell and Brongniart[229] as an alga, but there is little doubt of\r\ntheir being of the same category as the track shown in fig. 30, 3.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSILS SIMULATING ALGAE.]\r\n\r\nThe well-known half-relief casts met with in Cambrian, Silurian and\r\nCarboniferous rocks, and known as _Cruziana_ or Bilobites, are probably\r\ncasts of the tracks of Crustaceans. The impression left by a King-Crab\r\n(_Limulus_) as it walks over a soft surface affords an example of this\r\nform of cast. It has been suggested that some of the Bilobites may\r\nbe the casts of an organism like _Balanoglossus_[230], a worm-like\r\nanimal supposed by some to have vertebrate affinities. The resemblance\r\nbetween some of the lower Palaeozoic Bilobites and the external\r\nfeatures of a _Balanoglossus_ is very striking, and such a comparison\r\nis worth considering in view of the fact that soft-bodied animals have\r\noccasionally left distinct impressions on ancient sediments.\r\n\r\nThe literature on the subject of fossil algae _versus_ inorganic and\r\nanimal markings is too extensive and too wearisome to consider in\r\na short summary; the student will find a sufficient amount of such\r\ncontroversial writing—with references to more—in the works quoted\r\nbelow[231].\r\n\r\nIn the Stockholm Museum of Palaeobotany there is an exceedingly\r\ninteresting collection of plaster casts obtained by Dr Nathorst\r\nin his experiments on the manufacture of fossil ‘algae,’ which\r\nafford convincing proof of the value and correctness of his general\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the hand on a soft moist surface produces a raised\r\npattern like a branched and delicate thallus. The well-known _Oldhamia\r\nantiqua_ Forbes and _Oldhamia radiata_ Forbes[232], from the Cambrian\r\nrocks of Ireland may, in part at least, owe their origin to mechanical\r\ncauses, and we have no sufficient evidence for including them among\r\nthe select class of true fossil algae. Sollas[233] has shown that the\r\nstructure known as _Oldhamia radiata_ is not merely superficial but\r\nthat it extends across the cleavage-planes. _Oldhamia_ is recorded from\r\nLower Palaeozoic rocks in the Pyrenees[234] by Barrois, who agrees with\r\nSalter, Göppert and others in classing the fossil among the algae. The\r\nphotograph accompanying Barrois’ description does not, however, add\r\nfurther evidence in favour of accepting _Oldhamia_ as a genus of fossil\r\nalgae.\r\n\r\nThe burrows made by _Gryllotalpa vulgaris_ Latr., the Mole-cricket,\r\nhave been shown by Zeiller to bear a close resemblance to a branch of a\r\nconifer in half-relief (fig. 30, 4), or to such a supposed algal genus\r\nas _Phymatoderma_[235].\r\n\r\nIn fig. 30, 1, we have what might well be described as a fossil\r\nalga. This is merely a cast of a miniature river-system such as one\r\nfrequently sees cut out by the small rills of water flowing over a\r\ngently-sloping sandy beach. A cast figured and described by Newberry\r\nas an alga, _Dendrophycus triassicus_[236], from the Trias of the\r\nConnecticut Valley, is practically identical with the rill-marks\r\nshown in fig. 30, 1. The cracks produced in drying and contracting\r\nsediment may form moulds in which casts are subsequently produced by\r\nthe deposition of an overlying layer of sand, and such casts have\r\nbeen erroneously referred to algal impressions[237]. Dawson[238] has\r\nfigured two good examples of Carboniferous rill-marks from Nova Scotia\r\nin his paper on Palaeozoic burrows and tracks of invertebrate animals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECOGNITION OF FOSSIL ALGAE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. _Chondrites verisimilis_ Salt. Wenlock\r\n  limestone, Dudley. From a specimen in the British Museum (V. 2550).\r\n  Slightly reduced.]\r\n\r\nThe specimen represented in fig. 31 affords an example of a fairly\r\nwell-known fossil from the Wenlock limestone, originally described by\r\nSalter as _Chondrites verisimilis_ Salt, from Dudley[239]. He regarded\r\nit as an alga, and the graphitic impression agrees closely in form\r\nwith the thallus of some small seaweeds. A closer examination of the\r\nfossil reveals a curious and characteristic irregular wrinkling on the\r\ngraphite surface, which suggests an organism of more chitinous and\r\nfirmer material than that of an alga.\r\n\r\nA similar and probably an identical fossil is described and figured\r\nby Lapworth[240] in an appendix to a paper by Walter Keeping on the\r\ngeology of Central Wales, under the name of _Odontocaulis Keepingi_\r\nLap. and regarded as a dendroid graptolite. In any case we have no\r\nsatisfactory grounds for including these fossils in the plant-kingdom.\r\n\r\nHow then are we to recognise the traces of ancient algae? There is no\r\ngolden rule, and we must admit the difficulty of separating real fossil\r\nalgae from markings made by animal or mechanical agency. The presence\r\nof a carbonaceous film is occasionally a help, but its occurrence is\r\nno sure test of plant origin, nor is its absence a fatal objection\r\nto an organic origin. While being fully alive to the small value of\r\nexternal resemblance, and to the numerous agents which have been shown\r\nto be capable of producing appearances indistinguishable from plant\r\nimpressions, we must not go too far in a purely negative direction.\r\n\r\nAn important contribution to the subject of fossil algae has lately\r\nappeared by Prof. Rothpletz[241]. He deals more particularly with\r\nthe much discussed Flysch[242] Fucoids of Tertiary age, and while\r\nrefusing to accept certain examples as fossil algae, he brings forward\r\nweighty arguments in favour of including several other forms among\r\nthe algae. He is of opinion that most of the main divisions of the\r\nalgae are represented among the Flysch Fucoids, but considers that the\r\nPhaeophyceae are the most numerous.\r\n\r\nRothpletz’s work is chiefly interesting as illustrating the application\r\nof microscopic examination and chemical analysis to the determination\r\nof fossil algae. Although he makes out a good case in favour of\r\nrestoring many of the Tertiary fossils to the plant kingdom, the\r\nmaterial at his disposal does not admit of satisfactory botanical\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\nNo doubt some of the fossils from the Silurian and Cambrian rocks are\r\ntrue algae, and Nathorst has pointed out that such a species as Hall’s\r\n_Sphenothallus angustifolius_[243] may well be an alga. Additional\r\nexamples might be quoted from Bornemann and other writers, but in view\r\nof the attempts which are sometimes made to trace the development of\r\nmore recent plants to more than doubtful Lower Palaeozoic Algae, one\r\nmust agree with Nathorst’s opinion,—“Je crois que l’on rend un bien\r\nmauvais service à la théorie de l’évolution, en essayant de baser\r\nl’arbre généalogique des algues fossiles sur des corps aussi douteux\r\nque les Bilobites, Crossochorda, Eophyton, etc.[244]”\r\n\r\nThere are many carbonaceous impressions on rocks of different ages\r\nwhich it is reasonable to refer to algal origin, and although such\r\nare of little or no botanical value, it may be a convenience to\r\nrefer to them under a definite term. The comprehensive generic name\r\n_Algites_[245] has been suggested as a convenient designation for\r\nimpressions or casts which are probably those of algae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUPPOSED FOSSIL ALGAE.]\r\n\r\nSome of the fossils described by Mr Kidston from British Carboniferous\r\nrocks as probably algae present an undoubted algal appearance, and\r\nmight be placed in the genus _Algites_; but in some cases—e.g.\r\n_Chondrites plumosa_[246] Kidst. from the Calciferous Sandstone of\r\nEskdale, one feels much more doubtful; in this particular instance the\r\nimpressions suggest the fine roots of a water-plant.\r\n\r\nThe statement is occasionally made that the numerous fossil algae\r\nand the absence of higher plants in the older strata justify the\r\ndescription of the oldest rocks as belonging to the ‘age of algae.’\r\nSuch an assertion rests on an unsound basis, and is rather the\r\nexpression of what might be expected than what has been proved to\r\nbe the case. The oldest plants with which we are at all closely\r\nacquainted are of such a type as to forcibly suggest that in the lowest\r\nfossiliferous rocks we are still very far from the sediments of that\r\nage which witnessed the dawn of plant life.\r\n\r\nMany of the obscure markings on rock surfaces which have been referred\r\nto existing genera of algae or described as new genera, are much\r\ntoo doubtful to be included even under such a comprehensive name as\r\n_Algites_. Space does not admit of further reference to determinations\r\nof this type which abound in palaeontological literature.\r\n\r\nIt would be very difficult to produce satisfactory evidence for the\r\nalgal nature of many of the supposed fossil algae from Cambrian\r\nrocks[247]; there has been a special tendency to recognise algal\r\nremains in the oldest fossiliferous strata, due in part no doubt to the\r\nfallacy that in that period nothing higher than Thallophytes is likely\r\nto have existed. The so-called _Phycodes_ referred to by Credner[248]\r\nas characteristic of the Cambrian rocks of the Fichtelgebirge\r\n(“Phycoden-Schiefer”) is probably of inorganic origin, and comparable\r\nto the genus _Vexillum_ of Saporta[249] and other writers, which\r\nSolms-Laubach has described as being formed every day in the soft mud\r\nof our ponds where local currents are checked by branches and other\r\nobstacles[250]. There are several good specimens of _Phycodes_ in the\r\nBergakademie of Berlin and in the Leipzig Museum which, I believe,\r\nclearly demonstrate the absence of all satisfactory evidence of an\r\nalgal origin.\r\n\r\nWe may next pass to a short description of a few representative types\r\nof algae, which may reasonably be classed under definite families, and\r\naccepted as evidence possessing some botanical value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A. DIATOMACEAE (BACILLARIACEAE).\r\n\r\nThis family occupies a somewhat isolated position among the algae, and\r\nis best considered as a distinct subdivision rather than as a family of\r\nthe Phaeophyceae or Brown algae, with which it possesses as a common\r\ncharacteristic a brown-colouring matter.\r\n\r\nSingle-celled plants consisting of a simple protoplasmic body\r\ncontaining a nucleus and brown colouring matter (diatomin) associated\r\nwith the chlorophyll. The cell-wall is in the form of two halves,\r\nknown as _valves_, which fit into one another like the two portions of\r\na pill-box. The cell-wall contains a large amount of silica, and the\r\nsiliceous cases of the diatoms are commonly spoken of as the valves of\r\nthe individual, or the _frustules_. Diatoms exhibit a characteristic\r\ncreeping movement, and are reproduced by division, also by the\r\ndevelopment of spores in various forms[251].\r\n\r\nThe recent members of the family have an exceedingly wide distribution,\r\noccurring both in freshwater and in the sea. Owing to the lightness\r\nof the frustules, they are frequently carried along in the air, and\r\natmospheric dust falling on ships at sea has been found to contain\r\nlarge numbers of diatoms[252]. The siliceous valves are abundant\r\nin guano deposits, and they have been found also in association\r\nwith volcanic material. Diatomaceous deposits are now being formed\r\nin the Yellowstone Park district; “they cover many square miles in\r\nthe vicinity of active or extinct hot spring vents of the park, and\r\nare often three feet, four feet, and sometimes five to six feet\r\nthick[253].” The gradual accumulation of the siliceous tests on the\r\nfloor of a fresh-water lake results in the formation of a sediment\r\nconsisting in part of pure silica. Such deposits, often spoken of as\r\n_kieselguhr_ or _diatomite_, and used as a polishing material, occur\r\nin many parts of Britain, marking the sites of dried-up pools or lakes.\r\nAt the northern end of the island of Skye there occurs an unusually\r\npure deposit of diatomite overlain by peat and turf, and extending over\r\nan area of fifty-eight square miles. Many of the individuals in this\r\ndeposit were in all probability carried into the lake by running water,\r\nwhile others lived in the lake and after death their tests contributed\r\nto the siliceous deposit[254]. The late Dr Ehrenberg published numerous\r\npapers on diatomaceous deposits in different parts of the world, and\r\nin his great work, _Zur Mikrogeologie_[255], he gave numerous and\r\nbeautifully executed illustrations of such siliceous accumulations. In\r\nmany of the samples he figures one sees fragments of plant tissues,\r\nspores of conifers and ferns, associated with the diatom tests. The\r\noccurrence of the pollen grains of coniferous trees in lacustrine and\r\nmarine deposits is not surprising in view of their abundance in Lake\r\nConstance and other lakes. It is stated that the pollen of conifers in\r\nthe Norwegian fiords plays an important part in the nourishment of the\r\nRhizopod _Saccamina_[256].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIATOMACEOUS OOZE.]\r\n\r\nIn the waters of the ocean diatoms are of frequent occurrence, and\r\nvery widely distributed. Sir Joseph Hooker records the existence of\r\nmasses of diatomaceous ooze over a wide area in Antarctic regions[257].\r\nAlong the shores of the Victoria Barrier, a perpendicular wall of ice,\r\nbetween one and two hundred feet above sea-level, the soundings were\r\nfound to be invariably charged with diatom remains, and from the base\r\nof the ice-wall there appeared to be in process of formation a bank\r\nof these tests stretching north for a distance of 200 miles. The more\r\nextended researches conducted during the cruise of the Challenger\r\nhave clearly proved the enormous accumulations of diatoms now being\r\nformed on the ocean-bed[258]. South of latitude 45° S. there is now\r\nbeing built up a vast deposit which may be eventually upraised as a\r\nfairly pure siliceous rock. From extreme northern latitudes Nansen has\r\nrecently recorded the occurrence of these lowly organised plants.\r\nHe writes,—“I found a whole world of diatoms and other microscopical\r\norganisms, both vegetable and animal, living in the fresh-water pools\r\non the Polar drift-ice, and constantly travelling from Siberia to the\r\neast coast of Greenland[259].” In warmer latitudes diatoms abound in\r\nthe surface waters, but there they are associated with numerous other\r\nforms of the Plankton vegetation. The waters of the Amazon carry with\r\nthem into the sea large numbers of fresh-water forms, which are floated\r\nout to sea and finally added to the rock-building material which is\r\nconstantly accumulating on the ocean floor[260]. No definite results\r\nhave so far been obtained as to the geographical and bathymetrical\r\ndistribution of marine diatoms.\r\n\r\nThe enormous number of recent species precludes any attempt to give a\r\ndescription of the better-known forms. It is more important for us to\r\nrealize how common and widely distributed are the living genera. The\r\nhard and almost indestructible valves have been frequently found in a\r\nfossil condition, often forming thick and extensive masses of siliceous\r\nrock. From diatom-beds now forming in lakes and on the ocean-bed we\r\npass to deposits such as those in Skye and elsewhere, which mark the\r\nsite of recently dried-up sheets of water, and so to older rocks of\r\nTertiary age formed under similar conditions. Among the many examples\r\nof diatomaceous deposits of Tertiary and Cretaceous age mention\r\nshould be made of those of Berlin, Königsberg, Bilin in Bohemia, and\r\nRichmond in Virginia. The diatoms in the beds of Berlin are regarded\r\nas fresh-water, and those of Richmond as marine. It has been pointed\r\nout by Pfitzer that it is a comparatively easy matter to distinguish\r\nbetween fresh-water and marine forms of diatoms. The diatomaceous rocks\r\nof Bilin are known as polishing slates; they attain a thickness of 50\r\nfeet. In these, as in many other cases, the deposit has become cemented\r\ntogether as a hard flinty or glassy rock, in which the cementing\r\nmaterial was formed by the solution of some of the diatom tests[261].\r\nIn many cases in which calcareous and siliceous rocks reveal no direct\r\nevidence of organic origin it is probable that they were originally\r\nformed by the accumulation of plants of which the structure has been\r\ncompletely obliterated by secondary causes. The genus _Gallionella_\r\nplays an important part in the composition of the Bilin beds.\r\nOccasionally impressions of leaves and other organic remains are found\r\nassociated with the diatoms in the siliceous rocks. In the British\r\nMuseum (Botanical department) a large block of white powdery rock is\r\nexhibited as an example of a diatomaceous deposit of Tertiary age from\r\nAustralia. It is described as being largely made up of the tests of\r\nfresh-water diatoms, such as _Navicula_, _Gomphonema_, _Cymbella_,\r\n_Synedra_, and others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL DIATOMS.]\r\n\r\nThe abundance of Diatoms in Cretaceous rocks of the Paris basin has\r\nrecently been recorded by Cayeux[262]; it would seem that these algae\r\nhad already assumed an important rôle as rock-builders in pre-Tertiary\r\ntimes. Cayeux points out that the silica of these Cretaceous\r\ndiatomaceous frustules has often been replaced by carbonate of calcium.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the occurrence of Diatoms in the various diatomaceous\r\ndeposits, their siliceous tests may occasionally be recognised in\r\nargillaceous or other sediments. Shrubsole and Kitton[263] have\r\ndescribed several species of Diatoms from the London Clay of Lower\r\nEocene age. In many localities in the London basin the clay obtained\r\nfrom well-sinkings presented the appearance of being dusted with\r\nsulphur-like particles of a dark bronze or golden colour which\r\nglistened in the sunlight. These yellow bodies have been found to\r\nbe diatomaceous frustules in which the silica has been replaced by\r\niron pyrites. The genus _Coscinodiscus_ is one of the commonest forms\r\nrecorded from the London Clay[264].\r\n\r\nWithout further considering individual examples of diatomaceous rocks\r\nwe may briefly notice the general facts of the geological history of\r\nthe family. As Ehrenberg pointed out several years ago, the Tertiary\r\nand Cretaceous species of diatoms show a very marked resemblance to\r\nliving forms. In many cases the species are identical, and the fossil\r\ndeposits as a whole seem to differ in no special respect from those now\r\nbeing built up.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of two species of Liassic Diatoms, no trustworthy\r\nexamples of the Diatomaceae have been found below the Cretaceous\r\nseries. The oldest known Diatoms were discovered by Rothpletz[265]\r\namong the fibres of an Upper Lias sponge from Boll in Württemberg.\r\nThey occur as small thimble-shaped siliceous tests with coccoliths\r\nand foraminifera in the horny skeleton of _Phymatoderma_, a genus\r\nformerly regarded as an alga. Rothpletz describes two species which he\r\nincludes in the genus _Pyxidicula_, _P. bollensis_ and _P. liasica_.\r\nThis generic name of Ehrenberg is used by Schütt[266] as a subgenus of\r\n_Stephanopyxis_.\r\n\r\nSeeing how great a resemblance there is between the recent and\r\nCretaceous species, and how many examples there are of Tertiary diatom\r\ndeposits, it is not a little surprising that the past history of these\r\nplants has not been traced to earlier periods. In 1876 Castracane[267],\r\nan Italian diatomist, gave an account of certain species of diatoms\r\nsaid to have been found in a block of coal from Liverpool obtained\r\nfrom the English Coal-Measures. The species were found to be identical\r\nwith recent forms. It is generally agreed that these specimens\r\ncannot have been from the coal itself, but that they must have been\r\nliving forms which had come to be associated with the coal. The late\r\nProf. Williamson spent many years examining thin sections and other\r\npreparations of coal from various parts of the world, but he never\r\nfound a trace of any fossil diatom. There is no apparent reason\r\nwhy diatoms should not be found in Pre-Cretaceous rocks, and the\r\nmicroscopic investigation of old sediments may well lead to their\r\ndiscovery. Prof. Bertrand of Lille, who has devoted himself for some\r\ntime past to a detailed microscopical examination of coal, informs\r\nme that he has so far failed to discover any trace of Palaeozoic\r\ndiatomaceous tests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BACTRYLLIUM.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Bactryllium_ is often quoted in text-books as a probable\r\nexample of a Triassic diatom. It was first described by Heer[268] from\r\nthe Trias of Switzerland and North Italy, also from the neighbourhood\r\nof Heidelberg, and regarded as an extinct member of the Diatomaceae.\r\nHeer defined the genus as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Small bodies, with parallel sides, rounded at either end, the\r\n  surface traversed by one or two longitudinal grooves.”\r\n\r\n(fig. 32, C.) Several species have been figured by Heer from beds of\r\nMuschelkalk, Keuper and Rhaetic age. He describes the wall as thick and\r\nfirm (fig. 32, C. ii.) and probably composed of silica, with a hollow\r\ninterior. The specimen shown in fig. 32, C. was found in the Rhaetic\r\nbeds, and named by Heer _Bactryllium deplanatum_; it has a length\r\nof 4·5 mm.; the surface is transversely striated and traversed by a\r\nsingle longitudinal groove. Stefani[269] has given reasons in favour\r\nof removing _Bactryllium_ from the plant to the animal kingdom; he\r\npoints out that the specimens are too large for diatoms, and moreover\r\nthat they are asymmetrical in form and possessed a calcareous and not\r\na siliceous shell. He would place the fossil among the Pteropods,\r\ncomparing it with such genera as _Cuvierina_ and _Hyalaea_. In view\r\nof Stefani’s opinion we cannot attach any importance to this supposed\r\ndiatom, especially as it has generally been regarded as at best but an\r\nunsatisfactory genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. _A_, _Lithothamnion mamillosum_ Gümb.

Asexual reproduction by zoospores\r\nand other reproductive cells; sexual reproduction by means of the\r\nconjugation of similar gametes or by the fertilisation of a typical\r\negg-cell by a motile spermatozoid.\r\n\r\nThis family of algae is represented at the present day by numerous\r\nand widely distributed marine and fresh-water genera, as well as by\r\ngenera growing in moist air or as endophytes in the tissues of higher\r\nplants[270].\r\n\r\nSeeing how very few fossil forms have been described which have any\r\nclaim to inclusion in this subdivision of the Algae, it is unnecessary\r\nto enumerate or define the various families of the Chlorophyceae. It\r\nis true that many species have been figured as examples of different\r\ngenera of green algae, but few of these possess any scientific value.\r\nThere is, however, one division of the Chlorophyceae, the Siphoneae,\r\nwhich must be treated at some length on account of its importance from\r\na palaeobotanical and geological point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _a._ SIPHONEAE.\r\n\r\nThallus consisting of simple or branched cells very rarely divided\r\nby septa, and containing many nuclei. In certain genera the branches\r\nform a pseudoparenchymatous tissue by their repeated branching, and\r\nas a result of the intimate felting together of the branched cells.\r\nReproduction is effected either by the conjugation of similar gametes\r\nor by the fertilisation of an egg-cell.\r\n\r\n_Vaucheria_ and _Botrydium_ are two well-known British genera of\r\nthis order, but most of the recent representatives live in tropical\r\nand subtropical seas. The most striking characteristic feature of\r\nthis division of the Chlorophyceae is the fact that the thallus of a\r\nsiphoneous alga consists of an unseptate coenocyte; the plant may be\r\nextremely small and simple, or it may reach a length of several inches,\r\nbut in all cases the body does not consist of more than one cell or\r\ncoenocyte.\r\n\r\nFrom a palaeontological standpoint the Siphoneae are of exceptional\r\ninterest. It is impossible to do more than refer to a few of the living\r\nand fossil genera. There are numerous fossil representatives already\r\nknown, and there can be little doubt that further research would be\r\nproductive of valuable results.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the order, a few genera may be described belonging to\r\nthe three families Caulerpaceae, Codiaceae, and Dasycladaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           α. Caulerpaceae.\r\n\r\nThallus unseptate, showing an extraordinary variation in the external\r\ndifferentiation of the plant-body. Reproduction is effected by means of\r\ndetached portions of the parent plant.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Caulerpa_, represented by a few species in the Mediterranean\r\nand by many tropical forms, has already been alluded to as a striking\r\nexample of a plant which appears under a great many different\r\nforms[271]. As a recent writer has said, “Nature seems to have shown in\r\nthis genus the utmost possibilities of the siphoneous thallus[272],”\r\nFragments of coniferous twigs, the tracks and burrows of various\r\nanimals and other objects have been described by several authors as\r\nfossil species of _Caulerpa_. As an illustration of the identification\r\nof a very doubtful fossil as a species of _Caulerpites_, reference\r\nmay be made to such a form as _C. cactoides_ Göpp.[273] from Silurian\r\nand Cambrian rocks. There are several examples of this fossil in the\r\nBrussels Museum which probably owe their origin to some burrowing\r\nanimal, and may be compared with Zeiller’s figures of the tunnels made\r\nby the mole-cricket (fig. 30, 4)[274].\r\n\r\nMr Murray, of the British Museum, has recently described what he\r\nregards as a trustworthy example of a fossil _Caulerpa_ from the\r\nKimeridge Clay near Weymouth[275]. Specimens of the fossil were first\r\nfigured in a book on the geology of the Dorset coast as casts of an\r\nequisetaceous plant[276].\r\n\r\nTo this fossil Murray has assigned the name _Caulerpa Carruthersi_,\r\nand given to it a scientific diagnosis. The best specimens have the\r\nform of a slender central axis, giving off at fairly regular intervals\r\nwhorls of short and somewhat clavate branches; they bear a superficial\r\nresemblance to such a recent species as _Caulerpa cactoides_ Ag. An\r\nexamination of several examples of this fossil leads me to express\r\nthe opinion that there is not sufficient reason for assigning to them\r\nthe name of a recent genus of algae[277]. To use the generic name of\r\na recent plant without following the common custom of adding on the\r\ntermination “ites” (i.e. _Caulerpites_) is as a general rule to be\r\navoided in dealing with fossil forms; and there are, I believe, no\r\nsatisfactory grounds for referring to these fossils as trustworthy\r\nexamples of a Mesozoic alga.\r\n\r\nIn the present case I am disposed to regard the _Caulerpa_-like casts\r\nas of animal rather than plant origin. The clavate branches have\r\nthe form of very deep moulds in the hard brown rock which have been\r\nfilled in with blue mud. It is hardly conceivable that the branches\r\nof a soft watery plant such as _Caulerpa_ could leave more than a\r\nfaint impression on an old sea-floor. The specimens occur in different\r\npositions in the matrix of the rock and they are not confined to\r\nthe lines of bedding; in none of the examples is there any trace of\r\ncarbonaceous matter in association with the deep moulds. On the whole,\r\nthen, this Kimeridge fossil cannot, I believe, be accepted as an\r\nauthentic example of a Mesozoic _Caulerpa_.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that some of the supposed fossil algae may be\r\ncasts of egg-cases or spawn-clusters of animals. In Ellis’ Natural\r\nHistory of the Corallines[278] there is a drawing representing a number\r\nof disc-like ovaries attached to a tough ligament, and referred to the\r\nmollusc _Buccinum_, which bears a certain resemblance to the Weymouth\r\nfossil. A similar body is figured by Fuchs[279] in an important memoir\r\non supposed fossil algae.\r\n\r\nIt is not suggested that the _Caulerpa Carruthersi_ of Murray should be\r\nregarded as the cast of some molluscan egg-case attached to a slender\r\naxis, but it is important to bear in mind the possibility of matching\r\nsuch extremely doubtful fossils with other organic bodies than the\r\nthallus of a _Caulerpa_. In an example of an egg-case in the Cambridge\r\nZoological Museum, referred to a species of _Pyrula_, there is a hard,\r\nlong and slender axis, bearing a series of semicircular chambers\r\ndivided into radial compartments. The whole is hard and horny and might\r\nwell be preserved as a fossil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             β. Codiaceae.\r\n\r\nThe members of this Order present a considerable diversity of form as\r\nregards the shape of the plant-body; the thallus of some species is\r\nencrusted with carbonate of lime. The order is widely distributed in\r\ntropical and temperate seas.\r\n\r\nAmong the recent genera _Penicillus_ and _Codium_ may be chosen as\r\nimportant types from the point of view of fossil representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Codium._\r\n\r\nThe thallus of _Codium_ consists of a spongy mass of tubular\r\ncell-branches which are differentiated into two fairly distinct\r\nregions, an outer peripheral layer in which the branches have long\r\nclub-shaped terminations, and an inner region consisting of loosely\r\ninterwoven filaments.\r\n\r\n_Codium Bursa_ L. and _C. tomentosum_ Huds. are two well-known British\r\nspecies, the former presents the appearance of a spongy ball of\r\ncells, and in the latter the thallus is divided up into dichotomously\r\nforked branches[280]. In this genus the thallus is not encrusted with\r\ncarbonate of lime, at least in recent species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Sphaerocodium._ Fig. 37, D.\r\n\r\nRothpletz[281] instituted this genus for certain small spherical\r\nor oval bodies varying from 1 mm. to 2 cm. in diameter, which have\r\nbeen found on crinoid stems or shell fragments of Triassic age. Each\r\nspherical body consists of dichotomously branched single-celled\r\nfilaments, between 50 and 100µ in breadth, and from 300–500µ in height.\r\nThe tubular cavities occasionally swell out into spherical spaces which\r\nare regarded by Rothpletz as sporangia.\r\n\r\nThere is not sufficient evidence that _Sphaerocodium Bornemanni_ Roth.\r\nhas been correctly referred to the Codiaceae. The sporangia-like\r\nswellings described by the author of the species are not by any means\r\nconclusive as characters of important taxonomic value. Figure 37, D,\r\nillustrates the general structure of the fossil as seen in a transverse\r\nsection of one of the calcareous grains.\r\n\r\nLike _Girvanella_, which has been referred by some writers to the\r\nSiphoneae, _Sphaerocodium_ occurs in the form of oolitic grains. In\r\nthe Triassic Raibler and St Cassian beds of the Tyrol, as well as in\r\nrocks of Rhaetic age in the Eastern Alps, it makes up large masses\r\nof limestone. Rothpletz compares the structure of this genus with\r\nthat of the recent alga _Codium adhaerens_ Ag., but it is wiser to\r\nregard such tubular structures as _Girvanella_, _Siphonema_[282] and\r\n_Sphaerocodium_ as closely allied organisms, which are probably algae,\r\nbut too imperfectly known to be referred to any particular family.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Penicillus._\r\n\r\nThe recent genus _Penicillus_ is one of those algae formerly included\r\namong animals. Fig. 33, O, has been copied from a drawing of a species\r\nof _Penicillus_ given by Lamouroux[283] under the generic name of\r\n_Nesea_ in his treatise on the genera of Polyps published in 1821. He\r\ndescribes the genus as a brush-like Polyp with a simple stem.\r\n\r\nThe thallus consists of a stout stem terminating in a brush-like tuft\r\nof fine dichotomously-branched filaments. The apical branches are\r\ndivided by regular constrictions into short oval or rod-like segments\r\nwhich may be encrusted with carbonate of lime. A few of the segments\r\nfrom the terminal tuft of a recent _Penicillus_ are shown in fig. 35,\r\nE. Each of these calcareous segments has the form of an oval shell\r\nperforated at each end, and the wall is pierced by numerous fine\r\ncanals. _Penicillus_ is represented by about 10 recent species, which\r\nwith one exception live in tropical seas.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of _Penicillus_, or a very similar type, in a fossil\r\ncondition is due to Munier-Chalmas[284]. This keen observer has\r\nrendered great service to palaeobotany by directing attention to the\r\ncalcareous algae in the Paris basin beds, and by proving that many of\r\nthe fossils from these Tertiary deposits have been erroneously included\r\nby previous writers among the Foraminifera[285]. It is greatly to be\r\ndesired that Prof. Munier-Chalmas may soon publish a monograph on the\r\nfossil Siphoneous forms of which he possesses a unique collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Ovulites._ Figs. 33, K, L, and 35, F.\r\n\r\nIn his Natural History of Invertebrate Animals, Lamarck described\r\nsome small oval bodies from the Calcaire Grossier (Eocene) of the\r\nParis basin under the name of _Ovulites_. He defined them as\r\nfollows:—“Polypier pierreux, libre, ovuliforme ou cylindracé, creux\r\nintérieurement, souvent percé aux deux bouts. Pores très petits,\r\nrégulièrement disposés à la surface[286].”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. A and B, _Cymopolia barbata_ (L.); A,\r\n  transverse section of the calcareous cylinder. B, verticillate\r\n  branches and sporangium after removal of the calcareous matrix (A\r\n  and B after Munier-Chalmas).

(after\r\n  Lamouroux, nat. size).]\r\n\r\nThe specimens are referred to two species, _Ovulites margaritula_ and\r\n_O. elongata_.\r\n\r\nBy some subsequent writers[287] these calcareous fossils, like\r\nminiature birds’ eggs with a hole at either end, were included among\r\nthe Zoophytes. Carpenter and others afterwards referred _Ovulites_ to\r\nthe Foraminifera, and compared the genus with Lagena[288]. The single\r\nspecimens of _Ovulites_ have a length of 2–6 mm. At each end there is\r\nusually a fairly large and somewhat irregular hole (fig. 35, F), and\r\nin some rarer cases there may be two apertures at the broader end of\r\nan Ovulite. A good example of _Ovulites margaritula_ with two pores at\r\nthe broader end is figured by Michelin[289]. The surface of the shell\r\nwhen seen under a low magnifying power appears to be covered over with\r\nregularly arranged circular pores, which are the external openings of\r\nfine canals (fig. 33, L).\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Munier-Chalmas expressed the opinion, which was supported by\r\nstrong evidence, that _Ovulites_ should be referred to the siphoneous\r\nalgae[290]. He regarded it as generically identical with _Penicillus_\r\n(_Coralliodendron_, Kützing). It has already been pointed out that\r\nin _Penicillus_ the apical tuft of filaments is partially calcareous\r\n(fig. 33, O)[291]. The individual calcareous segments agree almost\r\nexactly with the fossil _Ovulites_. As a rule the Ovulites occur\r\nas separate egg- or rod-like bodies, but Munier-Chalmas informs me\r\nthat occasionally two or three have been found joined end to end in\r\ntheir natural position. The terminal holes in the fossil specimens\r\nrepresent the apertures left after the detachment of the calcareous\r\nsegments from the uncalcified filaments of the alga. The segments\r\nwith two holes at the broader end were no doubt situated at the base\r\nof dichotomising branches as shown in fig. 33, K. The restoration of\r\n_Ovulites_, shown in fig. 33, K, bears a striking resemblance to the\r\nfigure of an Australian _Penicillus_ given by Harvey in his _Phycologia\r\nAustralica_[292].\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these Eocene forms agreed closely in habit with\r\nthe recent species of _Penicillus_. The portions preserved as fossils\r\nare segments of the filaments which probably formed a terminal brush\r\nof fine branches supported on a stem. The retention of the original\r\ngeneric name _Ovulites_ is on the whole better than the inclusion of\r\nthe fossil species in the recent genus. The Tertiary species lived in\r\nwarm seas of the Lower and Middle Eocene of England, Belgium, France\r\nand Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Halimeda._\r\n\r\nAn example of an Eocene species of _Halimeda_ has been recorded by\r\nFuchs from Greifenstein under the name of _Halimeda Saportae_[293]. The\r\nimpression has the form of a branched plant consisting of wedge-shaped\r\nor oval segments, and there is a close resemblance to the thallus of a\r\nrecent _Halimeda_, e.g. _H. gracilis_ Harv. It is not improbable that\r\nFuchs’ determination is correct, but without more definite evidence\r\nthan is afforded by a mere impression it is a little rash to make use\r\nof the recent generic name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           γ. Dasycladaceae.\r\n\r\nIn this family of Siphoneae are included a number of genera represented\r\nby species living in tropical and subtropical seas.\r\n\r\nThe thallus consists of an elongated axial cell fixed to the substratum\r\nby basal rhizoids, and bearing whorls of lateral appendages of limited\r\ngrowth which may be either simple or branched. Many of the lateral\r\nbranches bear sporangia or spores. The thallus is in many species\r\nencrusted with carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nThe two genera _Acetabularia_ and _Cymopolia_ may be briefly described\r\nas recent types which are represented by trustworthy fossil forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. _Acetabularia mediterranea_ Lamx. From a\r\n  specimen in the Cambridge Botanical Museum (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Acetabularia._ Figs. 33, I, and 34.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of _A. mediterranea_ Lamx. (fig. 34) the few living\r\nspecies of this genus are confined to tropical seas.\r\n\r\nThe habit of _Acetabularia_ is well illustrated by the photograph of a\r\ncluster of plants of _A. mediterranea_ Lamx.[294] reproduced in fig.\r\n34. The thallus consists of a delicate stalk attached to the substratum\r\nby a tuft of basal holdfasts, and expanded distally into a small\r\ncircular disc 10–12 mm. in diameter and more or less concave above.\r\nThis terminal cap is made up of a number of laterally fused appendages\r\ngiven off from the upper part of the stalk in the form of a crowded\r\nwhorl. The whole thallus resembles a small and long-stalked calcareous\r\nfungus. In each radially elongated compartment of the fertile cap\r\n(fig. 33, I) there are several sporangia (_gametangia_) developed;\r\nthese eventually open and produce numerous ciliated gametes which\r\ngive rise to zygospores by conjugation. Fig. 33, I, represents the\r\ncap of an _Acetabularia_ in radial section and surface-view; the two\r\nradial compartments seen in section contain the elliptical gametangia;\r\nthe circular markings at the base of the figure are scars of sterile\r\ndeciduous branches.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant is unicellular, each chamber in the disc being in open\r\ncommunication with the stem of the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Acicularia._ Fig. 33, C–H.\r\n\r\nIn a recent monograph on the Acetabularieae, Solms-Laubach[295] has\r\ndescribed a new type of these algae which is of special importance\r\nfrom the point of view of the past history of the family. Möbius\r\ndescribed an example of _Acetabularia_ in 1889 under the name _A.\r\nSchencki_; this species has since been placed in D’Archiac’s genus\r\n_Acicularia_[296]. _Acicularia Schencki_[297] bears a close resemblance\r\nas regards external form to _Acetabularia mediterranea_. In the latter\r\nspecies the walls of the terminal disc compartments are calcified,\r\nand the cavity of each of the laterally fused members contains\r\nnumerous free spores; in _Acicularia_, the cavity of each disc-ray is\r\noccupied by a calcareous substance in the form of a spicule containing\r\nnumerous cavities in each of which is a single sporangium. A single\r\nspicule is seen in fig. 33, H, showing the spherical pockets in which\r\nthe sporangia were originally situated. This species, _Acicularia\r\nSchencki_, has been recorded from Martinique, Guadeloupe, Brazil, and a\r\nfew other places.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Acicularia_ was founded by D’Archiac for certain minute\r\ncalcareous spicules found in the Eocene sands (Calcaire Grossier)\r\nof the Paris basin. D’Archiac describes one species, _Acicularia\r\npavantina_, which he defines as follows:—“Polypier aciculaire, élargi,\r\net légèrement comprimé à sa partie supérieure, qui est échancrée au\r\nmilieu. Surface couverte de petits pores simples, nombreux, disposés\r\nirrégulièrement[298].” The same species is figured also in Michelin’s\r\n_Iconographie Zoophytologique_, and described as an organism of\r\nwhich the exact zoological position is uncertain[299]. After these\r\nfossils had been placed in various divisions of the animal kingdom,\r\nCarpenter[300] described several specimens as portions of foraminifera.\r\nFinally, Munier-Chalmas removed _Acicularia_ to the plant kingdom,\r\nand “with rare divination” placed the genus among the Acetabularieae.\r\nThe history of our knowledge of the true nature of _Acicularia_ is\r\nof unusual interest. Some of the specimens of this genus figured in\r\nCarpenter’s monograph have the form of imperfect long and narrow bodies\r\ntapering to a point at one end and broad at the other (fig. 33, F and\r\nG); they are joined together laterally and pitted with numerous small\r\ncavities. From the resemblance of such specimens to a fragment of the\r\nterminal fertile disc of the recent Acetabularias, Munier-Chalmas\r\nreferred the fossils to this type of algae. In the living species\r\nwhich were then known the radiating chambers of the disc contained\r\nloose sporangia, without any calcareous matrix filling the cavity of\r\nthe chambers. In the fossil Acicularias, on the other hand, the manner\r\nof preservation of the pitted calcareous spicules pointed to the\r\noccurrence of sporangia embedded in cavities in a calcareous matrix.\r\nSubsequent to Munier-Chalmas’ somewhat daring conclusions as to the\r\nrelation of _Acicularia_ to _Acetabularia_, Solms-Laubach found that\r\nthe species originally described by Möbius as _Acetabularia Schencki_\r\nfrom Guadeloupe presented exactly those characters in which the fossil\r\nspecimens differ from _Acetabularia_. The genus _Acicularia_ formerly\r\nrestricted to fossil species is now applied also to this single living\r\nspecies _Acicularia Schencki_.\r\n\r\nThe genus is thus defined by Solms-Laubach:—\r\n\r\n  “Discus fertilis terminalis e radiis inter se conjunctis formatus,\r\n  coronis et inferiore et superiore praeditis, sporae massa mucosa\r\n  calce incrustata coalitae, pro radio spiculam solidam cuneatam\r\n  formantes[301].”\r\n\r\nAs Solms-Laubach points out in his recent monograph, Munier-Chalmas’\r\nconjecture, “which had little to support it in the fossil material, has\r\nbeen more recently proved true in the most brilliant fashion by the\r\ndiscovery of a living species of this genus.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n1. _Acicularia Andrussowi_ Solms[302]. Fig. 33, C and D. This species\r\nwas first described by Andrussow[303] as _Acetabularia miocenica_ from\r\nthe Crimea. It occurs in Miocene rocks south of Sevastopol, and, with\r\n_Ostrea_ and _Pecten_, forms masses of white limestone.\r\n\r\nIn each sporangial ray of the disc the cavity contains a calcareous\r\nspicula bearing spore cavities in four rows. “Round each spore-cavity\r\nthere is a circular zone which stands out, when viewed in reflected\r\nlight, through its white colour against the central mass of the\r\nspicule, though a sharp contour is not visible[304].” Fig. 33, C, is\r\ntaken from a somewhat diagrammatic sketch by Andrussow; it shows ten of\r\nthe fertile rays of the disc. The thick walls of the chambers are seen\r\nin the two lowest rays, and in the next two rays the spore-cavities\r\nare represented. A more accurate drawing, from Solms-Laubach’s memoir,\r\nis reproduced in fig. 33, D. The calcareous spicule with numerous\r\nspore-cavities shown in fig. 33, H, is from a fertile ray of the recent\r\nspecies _Acicularia Schencki_. This corresponds to the spore-containing\r\ncalcareous matrix in each ray of the disc of _Acicularia Andrussowi_\r\nSolms. The spicule copied in fig. 33, F from one of Carpenter’s\r\ndrawings[305] of an Eocene specimen bears the closest resemblance\r\nto the recent spicule of fig. 33, H, and emphasizes the very close\r\nrelationship between the fossil forms and the single rare tropical\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n2. _Acicularia miocenica_ Reuss. Another Tertiary species has been\r\ndescribed under this name by Reuss[306] from the Miocene of the Vienna\r\ndistrict, from the Leithakalk of Moravia and elsewhere. It agrees very\r\nclosely with the recent species _A. Schencki_. A section of one of\r\nthe spicules of this species is shown in fig. 33, E; the dark patches\r\nrepresent the pockets in the calcareous spicule which were originally\r\noccupied by sporangia and spores.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Cymopolia_. Fig. 33, A, B, M and N.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Cymopolia_ is at present represented by two species, _C.\r\nbarbata_ (L.) and _C. mexicana_, Ag., living in the Gulf of Mexico and\r\noff the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\n_Cymopolia_ and _Acetabularia_, with several other calcareous algae,\r\nare figured by Ellis and other writers as members of the animal\r\nkingdom. Ellis speaks of the species of _Cymopolia_ which he figures as\r\nthe Rosary Bead-Coralline of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nFig. 33, M, has been drawn from a figure published by Ellis in his\r\n_Natural History of the Corallines_ published in 1755[307]. The thallus\r\nhas the form of a repeatedly forked body, of which the branches are\r\ndivided into cylindrical joints thickly encrusted with carbonate of\r\nlime, but constricted and uncalcified at the limits of each segment. A\r\ntuft of hairs is given off from the terminal segment of each branch.\r\nThe axis of each branch of the thallus is occupied by a cylindrical\r\nand unseptate cell which gives off crowded whorls of lateral branches.\r\nIn the lower part of fig. 33, M, the calcareous investment has been\r\nremoved, and the branches are seen as fine hair-like appendages of the\r\ncentral cell. The branches given off from the constricted portions of\r\nthe axis are unbranched simple appendages, but the others terminate\r\nin bladder-like swellings, each of which bears an apical sporangium.\r\nThe sporangia are surrounded and enclosed by the swollen tips of\r\nfour to six branches which spring from the summit of the sporangial\r\nbranch. Fig. 33, A, represents part of a transverse section through\r\nthe calcareous outer portion of a branch of _Cymopolia_; the darker\r\nportions or cavities in the calcareous matrix were originally occupied\r\nby the lateral branches and sporangia[308].\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 33, B, the sporangial branch with the terminal sporangium and\r\nthree of the investing branches are more clearly shown, the surrounding\r\ncalcareous investment and the thallus having been removed by the action\r\nof an acid.\r\n\r\nIn a transverse section of a branch from which the organic matter\r\nhad been removed, and only the calcareous matrix left, one would\r\nsee a central circular cavity surrounded by a thick calcareous wall\r\nperforated by radially disposed canals and containing globular\r\ncavities; the canals and cavities being occupied in the living plant by\r\nbranches and sporangia respectively.\r\n\r\nThe two circular cavities shown in the figure mark the position of the\r\nsporangia which are borne on branches with somewhat swollen tips. From\r\nthe summit the left-hand sporangial branch shown in fig. 33, A, three\r\nof the secondary branches are represented by channels in the calcareous\r\nmatrix; the two black dots on the face of the sporangiophore being the\r\nscars of the remaining two secondary branches.\r\n\r\nBy the lateral contact of the swollen ends of the ultimate branches\r\nenclosing the sporangia the whole surface of the thallus, when examined\r\nwith a lens, presents a pitted appearance. Each pit or circular\r\ndepression (fig. 33, N) marks the position of the swollen tip of a\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nThis form of thallus represents a type which is met with in several\r\nmembers of the Dasycladaceae. It would carry us beyond the limits\r\nof a short account to describe additional recent genera which throw\r\nlight on the numerous fossil species. For further information as to\r\nthe recent members of the family, the student should refer to Murray’s\r\n_Seaweeds_[309], and for a more detailed memoir on the group to\r\nWille’s recent contribution to the _Pflanzenfamilien_[310] of Engler\r\nand Prantl. Among the various special contributions to our knowledge\r\nof the Dasycladaceae, those by Munier-Chalmas[311], Cramer[312],\r\nSolms-Laubach[313], and Church[314], may be mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PALAEOZOIC SIPHONEAE.]\r\n\r\nThe publication of a short preliminary note by Prof. Munier-Chalmas in\r\nthe _Comptes Rendus_ for 1877 was the means of calling attention to the\r\nexceptional importance of the calcareous Siphoneae as algae possessing\r\nan interesting past history, of which satisfactory records had been\r\npreserved in rocks of various ages. Decaisne had pointed out in 1842\r\nthat certain marine organisms previously regarded as animals should\r\nbe transferred to the plant kingdom. Such seaweeds as _Halimeda_,\r\n_Udotea_, _Penicillus_ and others were thus assigned to their correct\r\nposition. Many fossil algae belonging to this group continued to be\r\ndealt with as Foraminifera until Munier-Chalmas demonstrated their true\r\naffinities. In Gümbel’s monograph on the so-called Nullipores found in\r\nlimestone rocks, published in 1871[315], several examples of siphoneous\r\nalgae are included among the fossil Protozoa.\r\n\r\nIn recent years there have been several additions to an already\r\nlong list of fossil Siphoneae. In addition to the numerous and\r\nwell-preserved specimens, representing a large number of generic and\r\nspecific forms, which have been collected from the Eocene of the Paris\r\nbasin, there is plenty of evidence of the abundance of the members of\r\nthe Dasycladaceae in the Triassic seas. In the Triassic limestones\r\nof the Tyrol, as well as in other regions, the calcareous bodies of\r\nsiphoneous algae have played no inconsiderable part as agents of\r\nrock-building[316]. Genera have been recorded from Silurian and other\r\nPalaeozoic horizons, and there is no doubt that the Verticillate\r\nSiphoneae of to-day are the remnants of an extremely ancient family,\r\nwhich in former periods was represented by a much more widely\r\ndistributed and more varied assemblage of species. There is probably\r\nno more promising field of work in the domain of fossil algae than the\r\nfurther investigation of the numerous forms included in Munier-Chalmas’\r\nclass of Siphoneae Verticillatae. A brief description of a few genera\r\nfrom different geological horizons must suffice to draw attention to\r\nthe character of the data for a phylogenetic history of this group.\r\n\r\nThe fossil examples of the genus _Cymopolia_ (_Polytrypa_) were\r\noriginally described by Defrance[317] in the _Dictionnaire des Sciences\r\nNaturelles_ as small polyps under the generic name _Polytrypa_.\r\n\r\nIn the Eocene sands of the Paris basin there have been found numerous\r\nspecimens of short, calcareous tubes which Munier-Chalmas has shewn\r\nare no doubt the isolated segments of an alga practically identical\r\nwith the recent _Cymopolia_. A section[318] through one of the\r\nfossil segments presents precisely the same features as those which\r\nare represented in fig. 33, A. The habit of the Eocene alga and its\r\nminute structure were apparently almost identical with those of the\r\nrecent species, _Cymopolia barbata_. The two drawings of _Cymopolia_\r\nreproduced in fig. 33, A and B, have been copied from Munier-Chalmas’\r\nnote in the _Comptes Rendus_[319]; the corresponding figures given\r\nby this author of the Eocene species (_Cymopolia elongata_ Deb.) are\r\npractically identical with figs. A and B, and show no points of real\r\ndifference. The segments of the thallus of the fossil species, as\r\nfigured by Defrance[320], appear to be rather longer than those of the\r\nrecent species. The calcareous investment of the axial cell of the\r\nthallus was traversed by regular verticils of branches or ‘leaves’; the\r\ncentral branch of each whorl terminates in an oval sporangial cavity,\r\nexactly as in fig. 33, A and B; and from the top of this branch there\r\nis given off a ring of slender prolongations which terminate on the\r\nsurface of the calcareous tube as regularly disposed depressions, which\r\nwere no doubt originally occupied by their swollen distal ends as in\r\nthe recent species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Vermiporella._\r\n\r\nThis generic name was proposed by Stolley for certain branched and\r\ncurved tubes found in Silurian boulders from the North German\r\ndrift[321]. The tubes have a diameter of ·5–1 mm., and are perforated\r\nby radial canals which probably mark the position of verticils of\r\nbranches given off at right angles to the central axis. The surface of\r\nthe tubes is divided into regular hexagonal areas.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of these Silurian fossils to _Diplopora_ and other\r\ngenera favours their inclusion in the Verticillate Siphoneae.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Sycidium._ Fig. 32, B.\r\n\r\nThe fossils included in this genus were first described by Sandberger\r\nfrom the middle Devonian rocks of the Eifel, and referred by him to the\r\nanimal kingdom. More recently Deecke has suggested the removal of the\r\ngenus to the calcareous Siphoneae, and such a view appears perfectly\r\nreasonable, although without more data it is not possible to speak with\r\nabsolute certainty.\r\n\r\n_Sycidium melo._ (Sandb.) Fig. 32, _B._ The specimen represented in\r\nfig. 32, B (i), (ii), drawn from Deecke’s figures[322], has the form of\r\na small oval calcareous body, 1 mm. in transverse diameter and 1–1·3\r\nmm. in longitudinal diameter. It is pointed at one end and flattened at\r\nthe other. At the flatter end there is a circular depression, continued\r\ninto a funnel-shaped cavity, and on the walls of this cavity there are\r\n18–20 radially disposed ribs, which extend over the surface of the\r\nwhole body. A series of transverse ribs intersects the vertical ribs at\r\nright angles. The calcareous wall is perforated by numerous whorls of\r\ncircular pores, and the internal cavity is a simple undivided space.\r\nEach of these oval bodies (fig. 33, B) is probably the segment of a\r\nthallus, and the perforations in the wall may have been originally\r\noccupied by lateral prolongations from the unseptate axial cell of the\r\nthallus. _Sycidium_ bears a fairly close resemblance to the Tertiary\r\n_Ovulites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Diplopora._ Fig. 35, A and B.\r\n\r\nThis genus of algae is characteristic of Triassic rocks, and is\r\nespecially abundant in Muschelkalk and Lower Keuper limestones of the\r\nAlps, Silesia, and elsewhere. The thallus, or rather the calcareous\r\nportion of the thallus, has the form of a thick-walled tube, with a\r\ndiameter of about 4 mm., and occasionally reaching a length of 50 mm.\r\nAt one end the tube has a rounded and closed termination, and the\r\nwall is pierced throughout its whole length by regular whorls of fine\r\ncanals. _Diplopora_ agrees with _Cymopolia_ in its main features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.

F, a single segment of\r\n  _Ovulites margaritula_ Lam. × 4. G, _Confervites chantransioides_\r\n  Born. (after Bornemann. × 150).]\r\n\r\nFig. 35, A, affords a diagrammatic view of a _Diplopora_ tube, and\r\nshews the arrangement of the numerous whorls of canals. In fig. 35,\r\nB, a piece of limestone is represented containing several Diploporas\r\ncut across transversely and more or less obliquely. In an obliquely\r\ntransverse section of a tube perforated by horizontal canals the\r\ncavities of the canals necessarily appear as holes or discontinuous\r\ncanals in the substance of the calcareous wall. The manner of\r\noccurrence of the specimens points to the abundance of this genus\r\nin the Triassic seas, and suggests that the calcareous tubes of\r\n_Diplopora_ may have been important factors in the building up of\r\nlimestone sediments[323]. In many instances no doubt the carbonate of\r\nlime of the thallus has been dissolved and recrystallised, and the\r\noriginal form completely obliterated. As in the rocks built up largely\r\nof calcareous Florideae (p. 185) which have lost their structure, it\r\nis a legitimate inference that some of the limestone rocks which shew\r\nno trace of organic structure may have been in part derived from the\r\ncalcareous incrustation of various algal genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Gyroporella._ Fig. 35, C and D.\r\n\r\nIn this genus from the Alpine Trias the structure of the calcareous\r\ntube is very similar to that in _Diplopora_, but in _Gyroporella_ the\r\ncanals form less distinct whorls and are closed externally by a small\r\nplate, as seen in figs. 35, C and D.\r\n\r\nAs Solms-Laubach has pointed out, the branch-systems of _Diplopora_,\r\n_Gyroporella_ and other older genera are much simpler than in the\r\nTertiary genera _Dactylopora_ and others[324].\r\n\r\nA species of _Gyroporella_, _G. bellerophontis_, has recently been\r\ndescribed by Rothpletz[325] from Permian rocks in the Southern Tyrol.\r\nThe thallus is tubular in form and has a diameter of ·5–1 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Dactylopora._\r\n\r\nThe genus _Dactylopora_ was founded by Lamarck[326] on some fossil\r\nspecimens from the Calcaire Grossier and included among the Zoophytes.\r\nD’Orbigny afterwards included it among the Foraminifera, and the\r\nstructure of the calcareous body has been described by Carpenter[327]\r\nand other writers on the Foraminifera. In a specimen of _Dactylopora\r\ncylindracea_ Lam. from the Paris basin, for which I am indebted to\r\nMunier-Chalmas, the tubular thallus measures 4 mm. in diameter; at the\r\ncomplete end it is closed and bluntly rounded. The wall of the tube is\r\nperforated by numerous canals, and contains oval cavities which were no\r\ndoubt originally occupied by sporangia. The shape of the specimens is\r\nsimilar to that of _Diplopora_, but the canals and cavities present a\r\ncharacteristic and more complex appearance, when seen in a transverse\r\nsection of the wall, than in the older genus _Diplopora_. Gümbel has\r\ngiven a detailed account of this Tertiary genus in his memoir on _Die\r\nsogenannten Nulliporen_[328]; he distinguishes between _Dactyloporella_\r\nand _Gyroporella_ by the existence of cavities in the calcareous wall\r\nof the tube in the former genus, and by their absence in the latter.\r\nThe oval cavities in a _Dactyloporella_ were originally occupied by\r\nsporangia; in _Diplopora_ and _Gyroporella_ the sporangia were probably\r\nborne externally and on an uncalcified portion of the thallus.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIn addition to the few examples of fossil species described above there\r\nare numerous others of considerable interest, which illustrate the\r\ngreat wealth of form among the Tertiary and other representatives of\r\nthe Verticillate Siphoneae.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to _Vermiporella_ as an example\r\nof a Silurian genus. Other genera have been described by Stolley\r\nfrom Silurian boulders in the North-German drift under the names\r\n_Palaeoporella_, _Dasyporella_ and _Rhabdoporella_[329]; the latter\r\ngenus is compared with the Triassic _Diplopora_, and the two preceding\r\nwith the recent _Bornetella_.\r\n\r\nSchlüter has transferred a supposed Devonian Foraminiferal genus,\r\n_Coelotrochium_[330], to the list of Palaeozoic Siphoneae.\r\nMunier-Chalmas regards some of the fossils described by Saporta under\r\nthe name of _Goniolina_[331], and classed among the inflorescences of\r\npro-angiospermous plants, as examples of Jurassic Siphoneae. The shape\r\nand surface-features of some of the examples of _Goniolina_ suggest a\r\ncomparison with Echinoid spines, but the resemblance which many of the\r\nforms in the Sorbonne collection present to large calcareous Siphoneae\r\nis still more striking. A comparison of Saporta’s fig. 5, Pl. xxxiii.\r\nand fig. 4, Pl. xxxii. in volume iv. of the _Flore Jurassique_, with\r\nthe figures given by Solms-Laubach[332] and Cramer[333] of species of\r\n_Bornetella_ brings out a close similarity between _Goniolina_ and\r\nrecent algae; the chief difference being the greater size of the fossil\r\nforms. The possibility of confounding Echinoid spines with calcareous\r\nSiphoneae is illustrated by Rothpletz[334], who has expressed the\r\nopinion that Gümbel’s _Haploporella fasciculata_ is not an alga but the\r\nspine of a sea-urchin.\r\n\r\nAmong Cretaceous forms, in addition to _Goniolina_, which passes\r\nupwards from Jurassic rocks, _Triploporella_[335] and other genera have\r\nbeen recorded.\r\n\r\n_Uteria_[336] is an interesting type of Tertiary genera; it occurs\r\nin the form of barrel-shaped rings, which are probably the detached\r\nsegments of a form in which the central axial cell was encrusted\r\nwith carbonate of lime, but the sporangia and the whorls of branches\r\ndiffered from those of _Cymopolia_ in being without a calcareous\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _b._ CONFERVOIDEAE.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to describe at length the fossil forms referred to\r\nthis division of the Chlorophyceae, there is one fossil which deserves\r\na passing notice. Brongniart in 1828[337] instituted the generic term\r\n_Confervites_ for filamentous fossils resembling recent species of\r\nconfervoid algae. Numerous fossils have been referred to this genus\r\nby different authors, but they are for the most part valueless and\r\nneed not be further considered. In 1887 Bornemann described some new\r\nforms which he referred to this genus from the Cambrian rocks of\r\nSardinia. He describes the red marble of San Pietra, near Masne,\r\nas being in places full of the delicate remains of algae having the\r\nform of branched filaments, and appearing in sections of the rock as\r\nwhite lines on a dark crystalline matrix. In fig. 35, G, one of these\r\nSardinian specimens is represented. This form is named _Confervites\r\nChantransioides_[338]; the thallus consists of branched cell-filaments,\r\nhaving a breadth of 6–7µ, and composed of ovate cells. It is possible\r\nthat this is a fragment of a Cambrian alga, but the figures and\r\ndescriptions do not afford by any means convincing evidence. From\r\npost-Tertiary beds various genera, such as _Vaucheria_ and others, have\r\nbeen recorded, but they possess but little botanical value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          C. INCERTAE SEDIS.\r\n\r\n        _Fossils in Boghead ‘Coal’ referred by some authors to\r\n                          the Chlorophyceae._\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years much has been written by two French authors,\r\nDr Renault and Prof. Bertrand, on the subject of the so-called Boghead\r\nof France, Scotland, and other countries. They hold the view that the\r\nformation of the extensive beds of this carbonaceous material was due\r\nto the accumulation and preservation of enormous numbers of minute\r\nalgae which lived in Permo-Carboniferous lakes.\r\n\r\nIn an article contributed to _Science-Progress_ in 1895 I ventured\r\nto express doubts as to the correctness of the conclusions of MM.\r\nRenault and Bertrand[339]. Since then Prof. Bertrand has very kindly\r\ndemonstrated to me many of his microscopic preparations of various\r\nBogheads, and I am indebted to Prof. Bayley Balfour of Edinburgh for an\r\nopportunity of examining a series of sections of the Scotch Boghead.\r\nThe examination of these specimens has convinced me of the difficulties\r\nof the problems which many investigators have tried to solve, but it\r\nhas by no means led me to entirely adopt the views expressed by MM.\r\nBertrand and Renault.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOGHEAD.]\r\n\r\nThe Boghead or Torbanite of Scotland was rendered famous by a\r\nprotracted lawsuit tried in Edinburgh from July 29th to August 4th,\r\n1853. A lease had been granted by Mr and Mrs Gillespie, of Torbanehill,\r\nin Fifeshire, to Messrs James Russell and Son, coal-masters of Falkirk,\r\nof “the whole _coal_, ironstone, iron-ore, limestone, and fire-clay\r\n(but not to comprehend copper, or any other minerals whatsoever, except\r\nthose specified) with lands of Torbanehill[340].” After the Boghead had\r\nbeen worked for two years the Gillespies challenged the right of Messrs\r\nRussell, and argued that the valuable _mineral_ Torbanite was not\r\nincluded among the substances named in the agreement. The defendants\r\nmaintained that it was a _coal_, known as gas-, cannel- or parrot-coal.\r\nA verdict was given for the defendants. Some of the scientific\r\nexperts who gave evidence at the trial considered that the Boghead\r\nafforded indications of organic structure, while others regarded it as\r\nessentially mineral in origin.\r\n\r\nThe Torbanite or Boghead is a close-grained brown rock, of peculiar\r\ntoughness and having a subconchoidal fracture. It contains about 65%\r\ncarbon, with some hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, and mineral substances. A\r\nthin section examined under the microscope presents the appearance of\r\na dark and amorphous matrix, containing numerous oval, spherical and\r\nirregularly shaped bright orange-yellow patches. Fig. 36, 1 shows the\r\nmanner of occurrence of the yellow bodies in a piece of Scotch Boghead,\r\nas seen in a slightly magnified horizontal section. Under a higher\r\npower the light patches in the figure reveal traces of a faint radial\r\nstriation, which in some cases suggests the occurrence of a number of\r\noval or polygonal cells.\r\n\r\nThe Autun Boghead possesses practically the same structure. The yellow\r\nbodies are often sufficiently abundant to impart a bright yellow colour\r\nto a thin section. If the section is vertical the coloured bodies are\r\nseen to be arranged in more or less regular layers parallel to the\r\nplane of bedding.\r\n\r\nThe Kerosene shale of New South Wales agrees closely with the Scotch\r\nand French Boghead; it is approximately of the same geological age, and\r\nis largely made up of orange or yellow bodies similar to those of the\r\nEuropean Boghead, but much more clearly preserved.\r\n\r\nThe nature and manner of formation of the various forms of coal should\r\nbe dealt with in a later chapter devoted to the subject of plants as\r\nrock-builders, but in view of the recent statements as to the algal\r\nnature of these bituminous deposits it may not be out of place to state\r\nbriefly the main conclusions of the French authors.\r\n\r\nMM. Renault and Bertrand regard each of the yellow bodies in the\r\nEuropean and Australian Boghead as the thallus of an alga. To the\r\nform which is most abundant in the Kerosene shale they have given\r\nthe generic name of _Reinschia_, while that in the Scotch and French\r\nBoghead is named _Pila_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Reinschia._ Fig. 36, 3.\r\n\r\nA section of a piece of Kerosene shale at right angles to the bedding\r\nappears to be made up of fairly regular layers of flattened elliptical\r\nsacs of an orange or yellow colour. Each sac or thallus is about\r\n300µ in length and 150µ broad (fig. 36, 3). A single row of cells\r\nconstitutes the wall surrounding the central globular cavity. The cells\r\nare more or less pyriform in shape, and the cell-cavities are filled\r\nwith a dark substance, described by Renault and Bertrand as protoplasm,\r\nand the cell-walls are fairly thick. In some of the larger specimens\r\nthere are often found a few smaller sacs enclosed in the cavity of\r\nthe partially disorganised mother-thallus. In the larger specimens\r\nthe wall is usually invaginated in several places, giving the whole\r\nthallus a lobed or brain-like appearance. The supposed alga, which\r\nmakes up ⁹⁄₁₀ths of the contents of a block of Kerosene shale, is named\r\n_Reinschia Australis_; it is regarded by the authors of the species as\r\nnearly related to the Hydrodictyaceae or Volvocineae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36, 1. Section of a piece of Scotch Torbanite.\r\n  Slightly enlarged. 2. _Pila bibractensis_ from the Autun Boghead, ×\r\n  282 (after Bertrand). 3. _Reinschia Australis_, from the Kerosene\r\n  shale of New South Wales, × 592 (after Bertrand).]\r\n\r\nIn the Kerosene shale from certain localities in New South Wales\r\nBertrand recognises a second form of thallus, which he refers to the\r\ngenus _Pila_, characteristic of the European Bogheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Pila_. Fig. 36, 2.\r\n\r\nThe “thallus” characteristic of the Scotch Boghead has been named _Pila\r\nscotica_, and that of the Autun Boghead, _Pila bibractensis_.\r\n\r\nIn the latter form, which has been studied in more detail by MM.\r\nRenault and Bertrand, the thallus consists of about 6–700 cells, and\r\nis irregularly ellipsoidal in form, from ·189–·225mm. in length,\r\nand ·136–·160mm. broad. The surface-cells are radially disposed and\r\npyramidal in shape, the internal cells are polygonal in outline and\r\nless regularly arranged (fig. 36, 2). The Pila thalli make up ¾ths of\r\nthe mass in an average sample of the Autun Boghead. The Autun Boghead\r\noften contains siliceous nodules, and sections of these occasionally\r\ninclude cells of a _Pila_ in which the protoplasmic contents and\r\nnuclei have been described by the French authors. The evidence for\r\nthe existence of these supposed nuclei is, however, not entirely\r\nsatisfactory; sections of silicified thalli which were shown to me by\r\nProf. Bertrand did not satisfy me as to the minute histological details\r\nrecognised by Bertrand and Renault.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Pila_ are compared with the recent genus _Celastrum_,\r\nand regarded as most nearly allied to the Chroococcaceae or\r\nPleurococcaceae among recent algae. Prof. Bornet[341] has suggested\r\n_Gomphosphaeria_ as a genus which presents a resemblance to the Autun\r\n_Pila_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Bogheads of Autun, Torbanehill, and New South Wales,\r\nthere are similar Palaeozoic deposits in Russia, America, and various\r\nother parts of the world. Full details of the structure of Boghead and\r\nthe supposed algae referred to _Reinschia_, _Pila_, and other genera\r\nwill be found in the writings of Bertrand and Renault[342].\r\n\r\nThe Kerosene shale of New South Wales affords the most striking and\r\nwell-preserved examples of the cellular orange and yellow bodies\r\nreferred to as the globular thalli of algae. It is almost impossible to\r\nconceive a purely inorganic material assuming such forms as those which\r\noccur in the Australian Boghead. On the other hand, it is hardly less\r\neasy to understand the possibility of such explanations as have been\r\nsuggested of the organic origin of these characteristic bodies.\r\n\r\nThe ground-mass or matrix of the Boghead is referred to a brown ulmic\r\nprecipitate thrown down on the floor of a Permian or Carboniferous\r\nlake, probably under the action of calcareous water. In this material\r\nthere accumulated countless thalli of minute gelatinous algae, which\r\nprobably at certain seasons completely covered the surface of the\r\nwaters, as the _fleurs d’eau_ in many of our fresh-water lakes. In\r\naddition to the thalli of _Reinschia_ and _Pila_ the Bogheads contain\r\na few remains of various plant fragments, pollen-grains, and pieces\r\nof wood. Fish-scales and the coprolites of reptiles and fishes occur\r\nin some of the beds. On a piece of Kerosene shale in the Woodwardian\r\nMuseum, Cambridge, there are two well-preserved graphitic impressions\r\nof the tongue-shaped fronds of _Glossopteris Browniana_, Brongn. There\r\ncan be little doubt that the beds of Boghead were deposited under water\r\nas members of a regular sequence of sedimentary strata. The yellow\r\nbodies which form so great a part of the beds are practically all of\r\nthe same type. _Reinschia_ and _Pila_ cannot always be distinguished,\r\nand it would seem that there are no adequate grounds for instituting\r\ntwo distinct genera and referring them to different families of recent\r\nalgae.\r\n\r\nStated briefly, my conclusion is that the algae of the French\r\nauthors may be definite organic bodies, but it is unwise to attempt\r\nto determine their affinities within such narrow limits as have been\r\nreferred to in the above _résumé_. The structure of the bituminous\r\ndeposits is worthy of careful study, and it is by no means impossible\r\nthat further research might lead us to accept the view of the earlier\r\ninvestigators, that the brightly coloured organic-like bodies may be\r\ninorganic in origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n               D. RHODOPHYCEAE. (FLORIDEAE. RED ALGAE.)\r\n\r\nThe thallus of the members of this group assumes various forms,\r\nand consists of branched cell-filaments of a more or less complex\r\nstructure. Cells of the thallus contain a red colouring matter in\r\naddition to the green chlorophyll. The reproduction is asexual and\r\nsexual; the formation of asexual reproductive cells (_tetraspores_) in\r\ngroups of four in sporangia is a characteristic method of reproduction.\r\nSexual reproduction is effected by means of distinct male and female\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few fresh-water genera all the red algae are\r\nmarine. The Rhodophyceae, like the Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae,\r\ninclude a shell-boring form which has been found in the common\r\nrazor-shell[343]. Several genera live as endophytes in the tissues\r\nof other algae. The recent species of this section of algae are\r\ncharacteristic of temperate and tropical seas. One subdivision of the\r\nred algae, the Corallinaceae, is extremely important from a geological\r\npoint of view and must be dealt with in some detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CORALLINACEAE.\r\n\r\nThe thallus is usually encrusted with carbonate of lime; it is of a\r\nbranched cylindrical form in the well-known _Corallina officinalis_,\r\nLinn. of the British coasts, of an encrusting and foliaceous type, in\r\nthe genus _Lithophyllum_, and of a more coral-like form in the genus\r\n_Lithothamnion_. The reproductive organs occur in conceptacles, having\r\nthe form of small depressed cavities in the thallus, or projecting as\r\nwarty swellings above the surface of the plant. Asexual reproduction\r\nis by means of tetraspores formed in conceptacles resembling those\r\ncontaining the sexual cells. The Corallinaceae may be subdivided into\r\nthe two families Melobesieae and Corallineae[344].\r\n\r\n  =Melobesieae.= Thallus encrusting, leaf- or coral-like;\r\n                 unsegmented.\r\n                 (_Melobesia_, _Lithophyllum_, _Lithothamnion_.)\r\n\r\n  =Corallineae.= Cylindrical filamentous and segmented thallus.\r\n                 (_Amphiroa_ and _Corallina_.)\r\n\r\nThe genus _Corallina_ is the best known British representative of\r\nthe Corallinaceae. With other members of the group it was long\r\nregarded as a coralline animal, and it is only comparatively recently\r\nthat the plant-nature of these forms has been generally admitted.\r\n_Lithophyllum_, _Lithothamnion_, _Melobesia_, and other genera of\r\nthe Corallinaceae and some of the Siphoneae play a very important\r\npart in the building and cementing of coral-reefs. The pink or\r\nrose-coloured calcareous thallus of some of these calcareous algae\r\nor Nullipores imparts to coral-reefs a characteristic appearance.\r\nIn some cases, indeed, the coral-reefs are very largely composed\r\nof algae. Saville Kent[345] describes the Corallines or Nullipores\r\nof the Australian Barrier-reef as furnishing a considerable quota\r\ntowards the composition of the coral rock. Mr Stanley Gardiner, who\r\naccompanied the coral-boring expedition to the island of Funafuti, has\r\nkindly allowed me to quote the following extract from his notes, which\r\naffords an interesting example of the importance of calcareous algae as\r\nreef-building organisms. “It is quite a misnomer to speak of the outer\r\nedge of a reef like this (Rotuma Island) as being formed of coral. It\r\nwould be far better to call it a Nullipore reef, as it is completely\r\nencrusted by these algae, while outside in the perfectly clear water,\r\n10 to 15 fathoms in depth, the bottom has a most brilliant appearance\r\nfrom masses of red, white and pink Nullipores, with only a stray coral\r\nhere and there.”\r\n\r\nAgassiz[346] has given an account of the occurrence of immense masses\r\nof Nullipores (_Udotea_, _Halimeda_ etc.) in the Florida reefs; his\r\ndescription is illustrated by good figures of these algae.\r\n\r\nIn the Mediterranean there are true Nullipore reefs, which are\r\ninteresting geologically as well as botanically. Walther[347] has\r\ndescribed one of these limestone-banks in the Gulf of Naples which\r\noccurs about 1 kilometre from the coast and 30 metres below the surface\r\nof the water. Every dredging, he says, brings up numberless masses\r\nof _Lithothamnion fasciculatum_ (Lamarck), and _L. crassum_ (Phil.).\r\nBetween the branches of the algae, gasteropods and other animals become\r\ncompletely enclosed by the growing plants, while diatoms, foraminifera,\r\nand other forms of life are abundant. Water percolating through the\r\nmass gradually destroys the structure of the algal thalli, and in\r\nplaces reduces the whole bank to a compact structureless limestone.\r\n\r\nThe same author[348] has also called attention to the importance of\r\n_Lithophyllum_ as a constructive element in the coral-reefs off the\r\nSinai peninsula.\r\n\r\n_Lithothamnion_ a typical genus of the Corallinaceae may be briefly\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Lithothamnion._ Fig. 37.\r\n\r\nPhilippi[349] was the first writer to describe this and other genera as\r\nplants. He gave the following definition of _Lithothamnion_:\r\n\r\n  “Stirps calcarea rigida, e ramis cylindricis vel compressiusculis\r\n  dichotoma ramosis constans.”\r\n\r\nThe thallus of _Lithothamnion_ grows attached to the face of a rock\r\nor other foundation, and forms a hard, stony mass, assuming various\r\ncoralline shapes. The exposed face may have the form of numerous short\r\nbranches or of an irregular warty surface.\r\n\r\nIn section (fig. 37, A.) the lower part of the thallus is seen to\r\nbe made up of rows of cells radiating out from a central point, and\r\nthe upper portion consists of vertical and horizontal rows of cells.\r\nThe whole body is divided up into a large number of small cells by\r\nanticlinal and periclinal walls, and possesses an evident cellular as\r\ndistinct from a tubular structure. Conceptacles containing reproductive\r\norgans are either sunk in the thallus or project above the surface. The\r\ntwo types of structure in a single thallus are shown in fig. 37, A,\r\nalso a conceptacle containing tetraspores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37, _A._ Section of a recent _Lithothamnion_ (after\r\n  Rosanoff[350], × 200). _B._ Section of _Lithothamnion suganum_,\r\n  Roth (after Rothpletz[351], × 100). _C._ A conceptacle with\r\n  tetraspores from a Tertiary _Lithothamnion_ (after Früh[352], ×\r\n  300). _D._ _Sphaerocodium Bornemanni_ Roth, (after Rothpletz, ×\r\n  150).]\r\n\r\nIn the closely allied _Lithophyllum_ the thallus is encrusting, and\r\nin section it presents the same appearance as the lower part of a\r\nLithothamnion thallus.\r\n\r\nSpecies of _Lithothamnion_ occur in the Mediterranean Sea, and are\r\nabundant in the arctic regions[353], while on the British coasts the\r\ngenus is represented by four species[354]. Some large specimens\r\nof _Lithothamnion_ and _Lithophyllum_ are exhibited in one of the\r\nshow-cases in the botanical department of the British Museum. For\r\nthe best figures and descriptions of recent species reference should\r\nbe made to the works of Hauck, Rosanoff, Rosenvinge, Kjellman and\r\nSolms-Laubach[355].\r\n\r\nIt is to be expected that such calcareous algae as _Lithothamnion_\r\nshould be widely represented by fossil forms. In addition to the\r\nbotanical importance of the data furnished by the fossil species as\r\nto the past history of the Corallinaceae, there is much of geological\r\ninterest to be learnt from a study of the manner of occurrence of both\r\nthe fossil and recent representatives. As agents of rock-building the\r\ncoralline algae are especially important. The late Prof. Unger[356] in\r\n1858 gave an account of the so-called Leithakalk of the Tertiary Vienna\r\nbasin, and recognised the importance of fossil algae as rock-forming\r\norganisms. The Miocene Leithakalk, which is widely used in Vienna as a\r\nbuilding stone[357], consists in part of limestone rocks consisting to\r\na large extent of _Lithothamnion_.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of Unger’s work several writers have described\r\nnumerous fossil species of _Lithothamnion_ from various geological\r\nhorizons. A few examples will suffice to illustrate the range and\r\nstructure of this and other genera of the Corallinaceae. In dealing\r\nwith the fossil species it is often impossible to make use of those\r\ncharacters which are of primary importance in the recognition of recent\r\nspecies. The fossil thallus is usually too intimately associated with\r\nthe surrounding rock to admit of any use being made of external form\r\nas a diagnostic feature. The size and form of the cells must be taken\r\nas the chief basis on which to determine specific differences. In\r\nthe absence of conceptacles or reproductive organs it is not always\r\neasy to distinguish calcareous algae from fossil Hydrozoa or Bryozoa.\r\nIn many instances, however, apart from the nature and size of the\r\nelements composing the thallus, the conceptacles afford a valuable\r\naid to identification. An example of a fossil conceptacle containing\r\ntetraspores is shown in fig. 37, C; it is from a Tertiary species of\r\n_Lithothamnion_, described by Früh from Montévraz in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n1. _Lithothamnion mamillosum_ Gümb. Fig. 32, A (i) and (ii). (p.\r\n155.) This species was first recorded by Gümbel[358] from the Upper\r\nCretaceous (Danian) rocks of Petersbergs, near Maëstricht, on the\r\nBelgian frontier. It was originally described as a Bryozoan. The\r\nthallus has the form of an encrusting calcareous structure bearing\r\non its upper surface thick nodular branches, as shown in fig. 32, A\r\n(ii); in section, A (i), the thallus consists of a regular series of\r\nrectangular cells.\r\n\r\nThe specific name _mamillosum_ has also been given to a recent species\r\nby Hauck[359], but probably in ignorance of the existence of Gümbel’s\r\nCretaceous species.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n2. _Lithothamnion suganum_ Roth. Fig. 37, B. The section of this\r\nform given in fig. 37, B shows three oval conceptacles filled\r\nwith crystalline material. The two lower conceptacles originally\r\ncommunicated with the surface of the thallus, but as in recent species\r\nthe deeper portions of the algal body became covered over by additions\r\nto the surface, forming merely dead foundations for new and overlying\r\nliving tissues.\r\n\r\nThe cells of the thallus have a breadth of 7–9µ, and a length of 9–12µ.\r\n\r\nThe specimen was obtained from a Lithothamnion bank, probably of Upper\r\nOligocene age, in Val Sugana[360], in the Austrian Tyrol.\r\n\r\nNumerous other species of Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary age\r\nmight be quoted, but the above may suffice to illustrate the general\r\ncharacters and mode of occurrence of the genus. It is important that\r\nthe student should become familiar with the _Lithothamnion_ and\r\n_Lithophyllum_ types of thallus, in view of their frequent occurrence\r\nin crystalline limestone rocks and in such comparatively recent\r\ndeposits as those of upraised coral-reefs. The coral-rock of Barbados\r\nand other West-Indian islands affords a good illustration of the\r\nmanner of occurrence of fossil coralline algae in association with\r\ncorals and other organisms[361].\r\n\r\nIn the fossil species of _Lithothamnion_ hitherto recorded there do\r\nnot appear to be any important features in which they differ from\r\nrecent forms; the geological history of the genus so far as it is\r\nknown, favours the view that the generic characters are of considerable\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Solenopora._ Fig. 38.\r\n\r\nMr A. Brown[362], of Aberdeen, has recently brought forward good\r\nevidence for including various calcareous fossils, described by several\r\nauthors under different names and referred to various genera of fossil\r\nanimals, in the genus _Solenopora_, which he places among the coralline\r\nalgae.\r\n\r\nSpecies of this genus have been described from England, Scotland,\r\nEsthonia, Russia, and other countries. The geological range of\r\n_Solenopora_ appears to be from Ordovician to Jurassic rocks; in some\r\ncases it is an important constituent of beds of limestone.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n_Solenopora compacta_ (Billings). Fig. 38. This species was originally\r\ndescribed by Billings as _Stromatopora compacta_, and afterwards\r\ndefined by Nicholson and Etheridge. The thallus forms sub-spheroidal\r\nmasses, from the size of a hemp-seed to that of an orange. The external\r\nsurface is lobulate; the fractured surface has a porcellaneous and\r\nsometimes a fibrous appearance, and is usually white or light brown\r\nin colour. In vertical section (fig. 38, B) the cells are elongated\r\nand arranged in a radiating and parallel fashion; they often occur in\r\nconcentric layers. The cells have a diameter of about ¹⁄₁₇ mm. and\r\npossess distinctly undulating walls, as seen in a tangential section\r\n(fig. 38, A). Brown describes certain larger cells in the thallus (fig.\r\n38, A) as sporangia[363], but it is difficult to recognise any distinct\r\nsporangial cavities in the drawing. The example figured is from the\r\nTrenton limestone of Canada; a variety of the same species has been\r\nrecorded from the Ordovician rocks of Girvan in Ayrshire. There appear\r\nto be good reasons for accepting Brown’s conclusion that _Solenopora_\r\nbelongs to the Corallinaceae rather than to the Hydrozoa, among which\r\nit was originally included. After comparing _Solenopora_ with recent\r\ngenera of Florideae, Brown concludes that “the forms of the cells and\r\ncell-walls, the method of increase, and the arrangement of the tissue\r\ncells in the various species of _Solenopora_ bear strong evidence of\r\nrelationship between that genus and the calcareous algae[364].”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. Solenopora compacta (Billings). A. Tangential\r\n  section. × 100. B. Vertical section. × 50. (After Brown.)]\r\n\r\nThe importance of the calcareous Rhodophyceae has been frequently\r\nemphasised by recent researches, and our knowledge of the rock-building\r\nforms is already fairly extensive. We possess evidence of the existence\r\nof species of different genera in Ordovician seas, as well as in those\r\nof the Silurian, Triassic, Jurassic, and more recent periods. It is\r\nreasonable to prophesy that further researches into the structure\r\nof ancient limestones will considerably extend our knowledge of the\r\ngeological and botanical history of the Corallinaceae.\r\n\r\nNumerous fossils have been described as examples of other genera[365]\r\nof Rhodophyceae than those included in the Corallinaceae, but these\r\npossess little or no scientific value and need not be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    E. PHAEOPHYCEAE (BROWN ALGAE).\r\n\r\nOlive-brown algae, thallus often leathery in texture, composed of\r\ncell-filaments or parenchymatous tissue, in some cases exhibiting\r\na considerable degree of internal differentiation. The sexual\r\nreproductive organs may be either in the form of passive egg-cells\r\nand motile antherozoids or of motile cells showing no external sexual\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nWith one or two exceptions all the genera are marine. They have a wide\r\ndistribution at the present day, and are especially characteristic\r\nof far northern and extreme southern latitudes. The gigantic forms\r\n_Lessonia_, _Macrocystis_ and others already alluded to, belong to this\r\ngroup; also the genus _Sargassum_, of which the numberless floating\r\nplants constitute the characteristic vegetation of the Sargasso Sea.\r\n\r\nPalaeobotanical literature is full of descriptions of supposed fossil\r\nrepresentatives of the brown algae, but only a few of the recorded\r\nspecies possess more than a very doubtful value; most of them are\r\nworthless as trustworthy botanical records. Many of the numerous\r\nimpressions referred to as species of _Fucoides_ and other genera\r\npresent a superficial resemblance to the thallus of the common\r\nBladder-wrack and other brown seaweeds. Such similarity of form,\r\nhowever, in the case of flat and branched algal-like fossils is of no\r\nscientific value. In many instances the impressions are probably those\r\nof an alga, but they are of no botanical interest. The flat and forked\r\ntype of thallus of _Fucus_, _Chondrus crispus_ (L.) and other members\r\nof the Phaeophyceae is met with also among the red and green algae, to\r\nsay nothing of its occurrence in the group of thalloid Liverworts, or\r\nof the almost identical form of various members of the animal kingdom.\r\nThe variety of form of the thallus in one species is well illustrated\r\nby the common _Chondrus crispus_ (L.). This alga was described by\r\nTurner[366] in his classic work on the _Fuci_ under the name of _Fucus\r\ncrispus_ as “a marine Proteus.” It affords an interesting example of\r\nthe different appearance presented by the same species under different\r\nconditions, and at the same time it furnishes another proof of the\r\nfutility of relying on imperfectly preserved external features as\r\ntaxonomic characters of primary importance.\r\n\r\nAn example of a supposed Jurassic _Fucus_ is shown in fig. 49, and\r\nbriefly described in the Chapter dealing with fossil Bryophytes.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Flysch Algae have recently been referred by\r\nRothpletz[367] to the Phaeophyceae under the provisional generic name\r\n_Phycopsis_, but they are of no special botanical interest.\r\n\r\nThe extremely interesting genus _Nematophycus_ has lately been assigned\r\nby a Canadian author[368] to a position in the Phaeophyceae. Although\r\nthe particular points on which he chiefly relies are not perhaps\r\nthoroughly established, there are certain considerations which lead us\r\nto include _Nematophycus_ as a doubtful member of the present group of\r\nalgae.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Nematophycus._\r\n\r\nThe stem attains a diameter of between 2 and 3 feet in the largest\r\nspecimens; it is made up either of comparatively wide and loosely\r\narranged tubes pursuing a slightly irregular vertical course\r\naccompanied by a plexus of much narrower tubes, or of tubes varying\r\nin diameter but not divisible into two distinct types. Rings of\r\ngrowth occur in some forms but not in others. Radially elongated or\r\nisodiametric spaces occur in the stem tissues in which the tubes are\r\nless abundant.\r\n\r\nReproductive organs unknown, with the possible exception of some very\r\ndoubtful bodies described as spores.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Sir William Dawson proposed the generic name _Prototaxites_\r\nfor some large silicified trunks discovered in the Lower and Middle\r\nDevonian rocks of Canada. A few years later the same writer[369]\r\npublished a detailed account of the new fossils and arrived at the\r\nconclusion that the Devonian stem showed definite points of affinity\r\nwith the recent genus _Taxus_, and the generic name suggests that he\r\nregarded it as the type of Coniferous trees belonging to the sub-family\r\nTaxineae. The reasons for this determination were afterwards shown\r\nby Carruthers to be erroneous. Dawson thought he recognised pits and\r\nspiral thickenings in the walls of the tubular elements, as well as\r\npointed ends in some of the latter. The spiral markings were in reality\r\nsmall hyphal tubes passing obliquely across the face of the wider\r\ntubes, and the apparent ends of the supposed tracheids were deceptive\r\nappearances due to the fact that the tubes had in some cases been cut\r\nthrough in an oblique direction. In 1870 Carruthers[370] expressed the\r\nopinion that Dawson’s _Prototaxites_ was a “colossal fossil seaweed”\r\nand not a coniferous plant. The same author[371] in 1872 published\r\na full and able account of the genus, and conclusively proved that\r\n_Prototaxites_ could not be accepted as a Phanerogam; he brought\r\nforward almost convincing evidence in favour of including the genus\r\namong the algae. The name _Prototaxites_ was now changed for that of\r\n_Nematophycus_. Carruthers compares the rings of growth in the fossil\r\nstems with those in the large Antarctic _Lessonia_ stems, but he\r\nregards the histological characters as pointing to the Siphoneae as the\r\nmost likely group of recent algae in which to include the Palaeozoic\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nWe may pass over various notes and additional contributions by Dawson,\r\nwho did not admit the corrections to his original descriptions which\r\nCarruthers’ work supplied. In 1889 an important memoir appeared by\r\nPenhallow[372] of Montreal in which he confirmed Carruthers’ decision\r\nas to the algal nature of _Prototaxites_; he contributed some new facts\r\nto the previous account by Carruthers, and expressed himself in favour\r\nof regarding the fossil plant as a near ally of the recent Laminariae.\r\nThe next addition to our botanical knowledge of this genus was made by\r\nBarber[373] who described a new specific type of _Nematophycus_—_N.\r\nStorriei_—found by Storrie in beds of Wenlock limestone age near\r\nCardiff. Solms-Laubach[374], in a recent memoir on Devonian plants,\r\nrecorded the occurrence of another species of this genus in Middle\r\nDevonian rocks near Gräfrath on the Lower Rhine. Lastly Penhallow[375],\r\nin describing a new species, lays stress on the resemblance of some\r\nof the tubular elements in the stem to the sieve-hyphae of the recent\r\nseaweeds _Macrocystis_ and _Laminaria_. He concludes that the new facts\r\nhe records make it clear that _Nematophycus_ “is an alga, and of an\r\nalliance with the Laminarias.” The recent evidence brought forward by\r\nPenhallow is not entirely satisfactory; the drawings and descriptions\r\nof the supposed trumpet-shaped sieve-hyphae are not conclusive. On the\r\nwhole it is probably the better course to speak of _Nematophycus_ as a\r\npossible ally of the brown algae rather than as an extinct type of the\r\nSiphoneae, but until our knowledge is more complete it is practically\r\nimpossible to decide the exact position of this Siluro-Devonian genus.\r\n\r\nSolms-Laubach[376] has suggested that the generic name _Nematophyton_,\r\nused by Penhallow in preference to Carruthers’ term _Nematophycus_,\r\nis the more suitable as being a neutral designation and not one which\r\nassumes a definite botanical position. In view of the nature of the\r\nevidence in favour of the algal affinities of the fossil, the reasons\r\nfor discarding Carruthers’ original name are hardly sufficient.\r\n\r\nBefore discussing more fully the distribution and botanical position of\r\n_Nematophycus_ we may describe at length one of the best known species,\r\nand give a short account of some other forms.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n1. _Nematophycus Logani_ (Daws.). Fig. 39, A–E. The stem possesses well\r\nmarked concentric rings of growth due to a periodic difference in size\r\nof the large tubular elements. The tissues consist of two distinct\r\nkinds of tubular elements, the larger tubes loosely arranged and\r\npursuing a fairly regular longitudinal course, and having a diameter of\r\n13–35µ; the smaller tubes, with a diameter of 5–6µ, ramify in different\r\ndirections and form a loose plexus among the larger and more regularly\r\ndisposed elements. Branching occurs in both kinds of tubes; septa have\r\nbeen recognised only in the smaller tubes. Irregular and discontinuous\r\nradial spaces traverse the stem tissues, having a superficial\r\nresemblance in their manner of occurrence to the medullary rays of the\r\nhigher plants.\r\n\r\nThe best specimens of this species were obtained by Sir William\r\nDawson from the Devonian Sandstones of Gaspé in New Brunswick. The\r\nlargest stems had a diameter of 3 feet and reached a length of several\r\nfeet[377]; in some examples Dawson found lateral appendages attached\r\nto the stem which he described as “spreading roots.” Externally the\r\nspecimens were occasionally covered with a layer of friable coal,\r\nand internally the tissues were found to be more or less perfectly\r\npreserved by the infiltration of a siliceous solution. Most of the\r\nexamples of _Nematophycus_ from Britain and Germany are much smaller\r\nand less perfectly preserved than those from Canada. The Peter Redpath\r\nMuseum, Montreal, contains several very large blocks of _Nematophycus_,\r\nin many of which one sees the concentric rings of growth clearly etched\r\nout by weathering agents in a cross section of a large stem.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 39, A, a sketch is given of a thin transverse section of a\r\nstem, drawn natural size. The lines of growth are clearly seen, and\r\nas in coniferous stems the breadth of the concentric zones varies\r\nconsiderably. The short lines traversing the tissues in a radial\r\ndirection represent the medullary-ray-like spaces referred to in the\r\nspecific diagnosis. A transverse section examined under a low-power\r\nobjective presents the appearance of a number of thick-walled and\r\ncomparatively wide tubes loosely arranged; they may be in contact or\r\nseparated from one another. If the microscope be carefully focussed\r\nthrough the thickness of the section the transversely-cut tubes appear\r\nto move laterally, producing a curiously dazzling effect if the\r\nobjective is raised or lowered rapidly. This lateral movement is due\r\nto the undulating vertical course of the tubes. Under a higher power\r\nthe lighter-coloured matrix in which the tubes are embedded shows a\r\nnumber of very much smaller and thinner-walled hyphal elements; some\r\nof these are cut across transversely, others more or less obliquely\r\nand others again longitudinally. These smaller tubes constitute an\r\nirregular plexus surrounding and ramifying between the larger elements.\r\nThe diameter of the larger tubes decreases for a certain distance in\r\na radial direction as seen in a transverse section, and this change\r\nin size gives rise to the appearance of concentric lines indicating\r\nperiodic changes in growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. _Nematophycus Logani_ (Daws.).

Fig.\r\n39, B, represents a small piece of a transverse section seen under a\r\nfairly high power. In fig. 39, C, the tubes are seen in longitudinal\r\nsection. The larger elements are unseptate and not very regular in\r\ntheir vertical course through the stem; the smaller elements are\r\nseen as fine tubes lying between and across the larger tubes. In the\r\nsections I have examined no undoubted transverse septa were detected in\r\nany of the tubular elements.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the possible connection between the larger and\r\nsmaller elements is one which is not as yet satisfactorily disposed\r\nof. Penhallow[378] regards the finer hyphal elements as branches of\r\nthe larger tubes, but Barber[379], who has carefully examined good\r\nmaterial of _Nematophycus Logani_, was unable to detect any organic\r\nconnection between the two. My own observations are in accord with\r\nthose of Barber. Further details and numerous figures of this species\r\nof _Nematophycus_ will be found in the memoirs of Carruthers, Penhallow\r\nand Barber.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nSome specimens of silicified _Nematophycus_ stems afford particularly\r\ninstructive examples of the state of preservation or method of\r\nmineralisation as a source of error in histological work. The sketches\r\nreproduced in fig. 39, D and E, were made from a section of a large\r\nspecimen of _Nematophycus_ in the British Museum. In fig. D we have\r\none of the radial spaces containing some indistinct small elements,\r\nthe tissue surrounding the space appears to consist of polygonal cells\r\nsuggesting ordinary parenchymatous tissue. In fig. E a few of these\r\n‘cells’ are seen more clearly, they have black and ragged walls, and\r\noften contain very small and faint circles of which the precise nature\r\nis uncertain. The true interpretation of this form of structure\r\nwas first supplied by Penhallow[380]. The black network simulating\r\nparenchymatous tissue consists of the substance of _Nematophycus_\r\ntubes which has been completely redistributed during fossilisation\r\nand collected along fairly regular lines, as seen in figs. D and E.\r\nThe original structure has been almost completely destroyed, and\r\nthe material composing the walls of the large tubes has finally\r\nbeen rearranged as a network, interrupted here and there by the\r\ncharacteristic radial spaces which remain as evidence of the original\r\n_Nematophycus_ characters. It is possible in some cases to trace\r\nevery gradation from sections exhibiting the normal structure through\r\nthose having the appearance shown in figs. D and E to others in which\r\nthe structure is completely lost. Penhallow describes this method\r\nof fossilisation in _N. crassus_ (Daws.); an examination of several\r\nspecimens in the National Collection leads me to entirely confirm\r\nhis general conclusions, and also to the opinion that _N. Logani_\r\nshows exactly the same manner of mineralisation as _N. crassus_. The\r\nchief point of interest as regards this method of preservation lies\r\nin the fact that a fossil described by Dawson[381] as _Celluloxylon\r\nprimaevum_, and referred to as a probable conifer, is undoubtedly a\r\nbadly preserved _Nematophycus_. Penhallow examined Dawson’s specimens\r\nand obtained convincing evidence of their identity with certain forms\r\nof highly altered _Nematophycus_ stems.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n2. _Nematophycus Storriei_ Barber. Fig. 40. The specimens on which\r\nBarber[382] founded this species were obtained by Mr Storrie from the\r\nTymawr quarry near Cardiff, in beds of Wenlock age. The fragmentary\r\nnature of the material is largely compensated for by the excellence of\r\nthe preservation. We may briefly define the species as follows:\r\n\r\nThe stem consists of separate interlacing undivided and usually\r\nunbranched tubes of varying diameter. Spaces more or less isodiametric\r\nin dimensions are scattered through the tissue. The spaces constitute\r\nregions in which the tubular elements branch freely.\r\n\r\nThe main distinguishing features of this British species are (i) the\r\nabsence of two distinct and well-defined forms of tubular elements.\r\nThe main part of the stem consists of thick walled tubes similar to\r\nthose of _N. Logani_, but the spaces between them are occupied by\r\nthinner-walled and smaller tubes varying considerably in diameter;\r\n(ii) the form of the spaces which are not radially elongated as in _N.\r\nLogani_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. _Nematophycus Storriei_ Barb. Longitudinal\r\n  section, from a photograph by Mr C. A. Barber. × 45.]\r\n\r\nFig. 40 shows the undulating course of the tubes as seen in a\r\nlongitudinal section; the black colour of some of the elements is\r\ndue to the fact that the surface of the wall is seen, while in the\r\nlighter-coloured portions of the tubes the wall has been cut through.\r\nThe lighter patch about the middle of the figure shows the form of one\r\nof the spaces in which the tubes are freely branched.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two species already described six others have been\r\nrecorded, but with these we need not concern ourselves in detail.\r\nOne of these species, _N. Hicksi_, was found by Dr Hicks[383] in the\r\nDenbighshire grits quarry of Pen-y-Glog near Corwen in North Wales. The\r\nposition of these beds has recently been determined by Mr Lake[384]\r\nas corresponding to that of the Wenlock limestone. This species and\r\n_N. Storriei_ are both Silurian examples of the genus. It is possible,\r\nas Barber has suggested, that the specimens described under these two\r\nnames should be referred to one species. The specimens found by Hicks\r\nwere small and imperfectly preserved fragments; Etheridge has given\r\na full description of their structure, and Barber has subsequently\r\nexamined the material. The preservation is not such as will admit\r\nof any very precise specific diagnosis; the fragments are correctly\r\nreferred to _Nematophycus_, but their specific characters cannot be\r\nclearly determined.\r\n\r\nSolms-Laubach[385] has described some fragments of another species\r\nof _Nematophycus_ from the Devonian rocks of the Lower Rhine. His\r\nspecimens are chiefly interesting as extending the geographical\r\nrange of the genus, and as affording examples of a curious method of\r\npreservation. The specimens obtained were small fragments, flattened\r\nand very dark brown in colour. The tubular elements consisted of an\r\nexternal membrane of black coal, enclosing a central core of dark red\r\niron-oxide. On burning the fragment on a piece of platinum foil the\r\ncoal composing the wall of the tubes was removed and the deep-red casts\r\nof the tube-cavities remained[386]. The investigation of the structural\r\ncharacters of this imperfect material was conducted by reflected light.\r\nUnder certain conditions, when it is impossible to obtain thin sections\r\nfor examination by transmitted light, it is possible to accomplish\r\nmuch, as shown by Solms-Laubach’s work, by means of observation with\r\ndirect light.\r\n\r\nThe last species to be noticed is _Nematophycus Ortoni_ recently\r\ndescribed by Penhallow. There are no concentric rings of growth,\r\nno radial spaces and no smaller hyphae in the tissues of this\r\ntype of stem. In longitudinal section, the tubes show occasional\r\nlocal expansions of the lumen which Penhallow compares with the\r\n‘trumpet-hyphae’ of some recent brown algae. No actual sieve-plates\r\nor transverse walls have been detected, but the general appearance of\r\nthe tubes is considered to afford distinct evidence of the original\r\nexistence of such walls. The figures accompanying the description do\r\nnot carry conviction as to the correctness of the reference of the\r\ntubes to imperfectly preserved sieve-hyphae.\r\n\r\nThe following list, taken, with a few alterations, from Penhallow’s\r\nmemoir[387], shows the geographical and geological range of the species\r\nof _Nematophycus_ hitherto recorded.\r\n\r\n                                 ╭ Lower Devonian of Gaspé.\r\n  _Nematophycus Logani_ (Daws.)  ┤ Silurian [Wenlock] of England.\r\n                                 ╰ Silurian of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\n  _N.

The few recorded instances of spore-like\r\nbodies by Penhallow and Barber are not satisfactory; we are still\r\nignorant of the nature of the reproductive organs. Such instances of\r\nlateral appendages as have been referred to do not throw much light\r\non the habit of the plant. So far as we know at present the stem of\r\n_Nematophycus_ was not differentiated internally into a cortical and\r\ncentral region. It may be that the specimens have been only partially\r\npreserved, and the coaly layer which occasionally surrounds a stem may\r\nrepresent a carbonised cortex which has never been petrified. The large\r\nand loosely arranged tubes constitute the chief characteristic feature\r\nof the genus; in some cases (_N. Logani_) there is an accompanying\r\nplexus of smaller hyphae, in others (_N. Storriei_) there is no\r\ndefinite division of the tissue into two sets of tubes of uniform size,\r\nand in _N. Ortoni_ the tubular elements are all of the large type.\r\n\r\nPenhallow has recognised the branching of large tubes in _N. Logani_\r\nand _N. crassus_ giving rise to the small hyphal elements. In most\r\nspecimens, however, no such mode of origin of the smaller tubes can be\r\ndetected. The spaces which interrupt the homogeneity of the tissues\r\nin some forms have been described as branching depots, on account of\r\nthe frequent occurrence in these areas of much branched hyphae. The\r\nfunction of these spaces (fig. 39, D, and fig. 40) may be connected\r\nwith aeration of the stem-tissues.\r\n\r\nAs Carruthers first pointed out the unseptate nature of the elements\r\nand the occurrence of large and small tubes forming a comparatively lax\r\ntissue suggested affinities with such recent genera as _Penicillus_,\r\n_Halimeda_, _Udotea_ and other members of the Siphoneae. In those fossil\r\nstems which possess tubes of two distinct sizes, we cannot as a rule\r\ntrace any organic connection between the two sets of tubular elements.\r\nTransverse septa have been detected in the tubes of some specimens\r\nof _N. Logani_. These considerations and the large size and habit of\r\ngrowth of the stem leave one sceptical as to the wisdom of assigning\r\nthe fossil genus to the Siphoneae. On the other hand, apart from\r\nthe doubtful sieve-hyphae of Penhallow, the manner of growth of the\r\nplant, the concentric rings, marked by a decrease in the diameter of\r\nthe tubes, the lax arrangement and irregular course of the elements,\r\nafford points of agreement with some recent Phaeophyceae. The stem\r\nof a _Laminaria_ (fig. 29) or of a _Lessonia_ are the most obvious\r\nstructures with which to compare _Nematophycus_. The medullary region\r\nof a _Laminaria_ or _Fucus_ and of other genera presents a certain\r\nresemblance to the tissues of the fossil stems. On the whole we may\r\nbe content to leave _Nematophycus_ for the present as probably an\r\nextinct type of alga, more closely allied to the large members of the\r\nPhaeophyceae than to any other recent seaweeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Pachytheca._\r\n                   (A fossil of uncertain affinity.)\r\n\r\nThere is another fossil occasionally associated with _Nematophycus_ and\r\nreferred by many writers to the Algae, which calls for a brief notice.\r\n_Pachytheca_ is too doubtful a genus to justify a detailed treatment in\r\nthe present work. Although, as I have elsewhere suggested[389], we are\r\nhardly in a position to speak with any degree of certainty as to its\r\naffinity, it is not improbable that it may eventually be shown to be an\r\nalga.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting a full diagnosis of the genus, we may briefly refer\r\nto its most striking characters.\r\n\r\n_Pachytheca_ usually occurs in the form of small spherical bodies,\r\nabout ·5 cm. in diameter, in Old Red Sandstone or Silurian rocks. In\r\nsection a single sphere is found to consist of two well marked regions;\r\nin the centre, of a number of ramifying and irregularly placed narrow\r\ntubes, and in the peripheral or cortical region, of numerous regular\r\nand radially disposed simple or forked septate tubes. The tubular\r\nelements of the two regions are in organic connection.\r\n\r\nThe name was proposed by Sir Joseph Hooker for some specimens found\r\nby Dr Strickland[390] in the Ludlow bone-bed (Silurian) of Woolhope\r\nand May-Hill. Examples were subsequently recorded from the Wenlock\r\nlimestone of Malvern and from Silurian and Old Red Sandstone rocks of\r\nother districts. Hicks[391] found _Pachytheca_ in the Pen-y-Glog grits\r\nof Corwen in association with _Nematophycus_, and the two fossils have\r\nbeen found together elsewhere. This association led to the suggestion\r\nthat _Pachytheca_ might be the sporangium of _Nematophycus_, and\r\nDawson[392], in conformity with his belief in the coniferous character\r\nof the latter plant, referred to _Pachytheca_ as a true seed.\r\n\r\nThe best sections of this fossil have been prepared with remarkable\r\nskill by Mr Storrie of Cardiff; they were carefully examined and\r\ndescribed by Barber in two memoirs[393] published in the _Annals\r\nof Botany_, the account being illustrated by several well executed\r\ndrawings and microphotographs.\r\n\r\nAmong other difficulties to contend against in the interpretation of\r\n_Pachytheca_ there is that of mineralisation. The preservation is such\r\nas to render the discrimination of original structure as distinct from\r\nstructural features of secondary origin, consequent on a particular\r\nmanner of crystallisation of the siliceous material, a matter of\r\nconsiderable difficulty.\r\n\r\nSuggestions as to the nature of _Pachytheca_ have been particularly\r\nnumerous; it has been referred to most classes of plants and relegated\r\nby some writers to the animal kingdom. The most recent addition to our\r\nknowledge of this problematic fossil was the discovery of a specimen\r\nby Mr Storrie in which the _Pachytheca_ sphere rested in a small cup,\r\nlike an acorn fruit in its cupule. This specimen was figured and\r\ndescribed by Mr George Murray[394] in 1895; he expresses the opinion\r\nthat the discovery makes the taxonomic position of the genus still more\r\nobscure. Solms-Laubach briefly refers to _Pachytheca_ in connection\r\nwith _Nematophycus_, and regards its precise nature almost as much\r\nan unsolved riddle now as it was when first discovered. For a fuller\r\naccount of this fossil reference must be made to the contributions\r\nof Hooker[395], Barber[396] and others. The literature is quoted by\r\nBarber and more recently by Solms-Laubach[397]. There are several\r\nspecimens and microscopic sections of _Pachytheca_ in the geological\r\nand botanical departments of the British Museum. The genus has been\r\nrecorded from Shropshire, North Wales, Malvern, Herefordshire,\r\nPerthshire and other British localities, as well as from Canada; it\r\noccurs in both Silurian and Old Red Sandstone rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Algites._\r\n\r\nA generic name for those fossils which in all probability belong to\r\nthe class Algae, but which, by reason of the absence of reproductive\r\norgans, internal structure, or characters of a trustworthy nature in\r\nthe determination of affinity, cannot be referred with any degree of\r\ncertainty to a particular recent genus or family.\r\n\r\nThis term was suggested in 1894[398] as a provisional and comprehensive\r\ndesignation under which might be included such impressions or casts\r\nas might reasonably be referred to Algae. The practice of applying to\r\nalga-like fossils names suggestive of a definite alliance with recent\r\ngenera is as a rule unsound. It would simplify nomenclature, and\r\navoid the multiplication of generic names, if the term _Algites_ were\r\napplied to such algal fossils from rocks of various ages as afford\r\nno trustworthy data by which their family or generic affinity can be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      V. MYXOMYCETES (MYCETOZOA).\r\n\r\nThis class of organisms affords an interesting example of the\r\nimpossibility of maintaining a hard and fast line between the animal\r\nand plant kingdom. Zoologists and Botanists usually include the\r\nMyxomycetes[399] in the text-books of their respective subjects,\r\nand the name Animal-fungi which has been applied to these organisms\r\nexpresses their dual relationship. They constitute one of three groups\r\nwhich we may include in that intermediate zone or ‘buffer-state’\r\nbetween the two kingdoms. From a palaeobotanical point of view the\r\nMyxomycetes are of little interest, but a very brief reference may be\r\nmade to them rather for the sake of avoiding unnecessary incompleteness\r\nin our classification than from their importance as possible fossils.\r\n\r\nThey are organisms without chlorophyll, consisting of a naked mass\r\nof protoplasm, known as the _plasmodium_, which may attain a size of\r\nseveral inches. Such plasmodia creep over the surface of decaying\r\norganic substrata, and in forming their asexual reproductive cells\r\nthey are converted into somewhat complex fruits containing spores. The\r\nspores produce motile swarm-cells, which eventually coalesce together\r\nto form a new plasmodium.\r\n\r\nA few examples of fossil Myxomycetes have been recorded from the\r\nPalaeozoic and more recent formations, but none of them are entirely\r\nbeyond suspicion. We may mention three examples of fossils referred to\r\nthis group, but only one of these is entitled to serious consideration.\r\n\r\n_Myxomycetes Mangini_ Ren.[400] It is not uncommon to find distinct\r\ntraces of original or secondary cell-contents in well preserved\r\npetrified plant-tissues. There is often a difficulty, however, in\r\ndistinguishing between the true cell-contents and the cells of some\r\nparasitic or saprophytic intruder. In some petrified corky tissue\r\nin a silicified nodule from the Permo-Carboniferous beds of Autun,\r\nRenault has recently discovered what he believes to be traces of a\r\nMyxomycetous plasmodium. The cork-cells would be without protoplasmic\r\ncontents of their own, and their cavities contain a number of fine\r\nstrands stretching from the cell-walls in different directions and\r\nuniting in places as irregular or more or less spherical masses. The\r\ndrawings given by Renault of these irregular reticulated structures\r\nwith scattered patches of what may possibly be petrified plasmodial\r\nprotoplasm bear a striking resemblance to the plasmodium of a\r\nMyxomycete. A figure of the capillitium of a species of _Leocarpus_\r\nfigured by Schröter[401] in his account of the Myxomycetes in Engler\r\nand Prantl’s work is very similar to that of Renault’s ‘plasmodium.’\r\n\r\nIt is by no means inconceivable that the _Myxomycetes Mangini_ may be\r\ncorrectly referred to this group, but the wisdom of assigning a name to\r\nsuch structures may well be questioned.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe other two examples call for little notice. Messrs Cash and\r\nHick[402] in a paper on fossil fungi from the Coal-Measures refer to\r\nsome small spherical bodies as possibly the spores of a Myxomycete.\r\nThey might be referred equally well to numerous other organisms.\r\n\r\nGöppert and Menge[403] in their monograph on plants in the Baltic\r\nTertiary Amber, express the opinion that an ill-defined tangle of\r\nthreads which they figure may be a Myxomycete.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no useful purpose to quote other instances of possible\r\nrepresentatives of fossil Mycetozoa; but the consideration of the above\r\nexamples may serve to emphasize the desirability of refraining from\r\nconverting a possibility into an apparently recognised fact by the\r\napplication of definite generic and specific names.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              VI. FUNGI.\r\n\r\nThe most striking difference between the fungi and algae is the\r\nabsence of chlorophyll in the former, and the consequent inability of\r\nfungi to manufacture their organic compounds from inorganic material.\r\nFungi live therefore either as parasites or saprophytes, and as the\r\nsame species may pass part of its life in a living host to occur at\r\nanother stage of its development as a saprophyte, it is impossible to\r\ndistinguish definitely between parasitic and saprophytic forms. The\r\nvegetative body of a fungus, that is the portion which is concerned\r\nwith providing nourishment and preparing the plastic food-substance\r\nfor the reproductive organs, is known as the _mycelium_. It consists\r\neither of a single and branched tubular cell known as a _hypha_, or\r\nof several hyphae or thread-like elements (filamentous fungi). The\r\nhyphal filaments may be closely packed together and form a felted\r\nmass of compact tissue, which in cross section closely simulates the\r\nparenchyma of the higher plants. This pseudoparenchymatous form of\r\nthallus is particularly well illustrated by the so-called _sclerotia_;\r\nthese are sharply defined and often tuberous masses of hyphal tissue\r\ncovered by a firm rind and containing supplies of food in the inner\r\nhyphae. They are able to remain in a quiescent state for some time,\r\nand to resist unfavourable conditions until germination and the\r\nformation of a new individual take place. The reproductive structures\r\nassume various forms; in some of the simpler fungi (Phycomycetes)\r\nsexual organs occur, as in the parallel group of Siphoneae among the\r\nalgae, but in the higher fungi the reproduction is usually entirely\r\nasexual. An interesting case has recently been recorded among the\r\nmore highly differentiated fungi in which distinct sexuality has been\r\nestablished[404]. In addition to the reproductive organs, such as\r\noogonia and antheridia, the asexual cells or spores are borne either\r\nin special sporangia, or they occur as exposed _conidia_ on supporting\r\nhyphae or _conidiophores_. Thick-walled and resistant resting-spores of\r\nvarious forms are also met with.\r\n\r\nWithout going into further details we may very briefly refer to the\r\nlarger subdivisions of this group of Thallophytes.\r\n\r\n  PHYCOMYCETES.        Mycelium usually consisting of a single cell.\r\n   ZYGOMYCETES,        Reproduction by means of conidia, and in many\r\n   OOMYCETES,          cases also by the conjugation of two similar\r\n   including           hyphae or by the fertilisation of an egg-cell\r\n   =Chytridiaceae=,    contained in an oogonium.\r\n   &c.\r\n\r\n  MESOMYCETES,\r\n   including the       Intermediate between the Phycomycetes and\r\n   Sub-classes         the higher fungi. Multicellular hyphae. No\r\n   HEMIASCI and        sexual organs.\r\n   HEMIBASIDII.\r\n\r\n  MYCOMYCETES.         Septate vegetative mycelium. No sexual\r\n   including the       reproduction—as a general rule. Asexual conidia\r\n   Sub-classes         and other forms of spores. In the Ascomycetes\r\n   ASCOMYCETES and     the spores are found in characteristic\r\n   BASIDIOMYCETES.     club-shaped cases or asci; in the Basidiomycetes\r\n                       the spores are borne on special branches from\r\n                       swollen cells known as _basidia_. The sporophore\r\n                       or spore-bearing body in this group may attain a\r\n                       considerable size (e.g. _Agaricus_, _Polyporus_,\r\n                       &c.) and exhibit a distinct internal\r\n                       differentiation.\r\n\r\nBefore describing a few examples of fossil fungi, it is important\r\nto consider the general question of their manner of occurrence and\r\ndetermination. Considering the small size and delicate nature of most\r\nfungi, it is not surprising that we have but few satisfactory records\r\nof well-defined fossil forms. The large leathery sporophores of\r\n_Polyporus_ and other genera of the Basidiomycetes, which are familiar\r\nobjects as yellow or brown brackets projecting from the trunks of\r\ndiseased forest trees, have been found in a fairly perfect condition\r\nin the Cambridgeshire peat-beds, and examples have been described also\r\nby continental writers[405]. As a general rule, however, we have to\r\ndepend on the chance mineralisation or petrifaction of the hyphae of a\r\nfungus-mycelium which has invaded the living or dead tissues of some\r\nhigher plant. In the literature on fossil plants there are numerous\r\nrecorded species of fungi founded on dark coloured spots and blotches\r\non the impression of a leaf. Most of such records are worthless; the\r\nexternal features being usually too imperfect to allow of accurate\r\nidentification. The occurrence of recent fungi as discolourations on\r\nleaves is exceedingly common, and the characteristic _perithecia_ or\r\ncompact and more or less spherical cases enclosing a group of sporangia\r\nin certain Ascomycetous species, might be readily preserved in a fossil\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASCOMYCETES.]\r\n\r\nSome examples of possible Ascomycetous fungi have been recently\r\nrecorded by Potonié from leaves and other portions of plants of\r\nPermian age. There is a distinct superficial resemblance between the\r\nspecimens he figures and the fructifications of recent Ascomycetes,\r\nbut in the absence of internal structure, it would be rash to do more\r\nthan suggest the probable nature of the markings he describes. For\r\none of the fungus-like impressions Potonié proposes the generic name\r\n_Rosellinites_; he compares certain irregularly shaped projections on\r\na piece of Permian wood with the perithecia of _Rosellinia_, a member\r\nof the Sphaeriaceae, and describes them as _Rosellinites Beyschlagii_\r\nPot.[406] Various other records of similar Ascomycetes-like fossils may\r\nbe found in palaeobotanical literature[407], but it is unnecessary to\r\nexamine these in detail. Unless we are able to determine the nature of\r\nthe supposed fungus by microscopical methods our identifications cannot\r\nin most cases be of any great value.\r\n\r\nAn example of the perithecia of a fungus (_Rosellinia congregata_\r\n[Beck])[408] has been recorded from the Oligocene of Saxony, which\r\nwould appear to rest on a more satisfactory basis than is often the\r\ncase. In this particular instance the small projections on a piece of\r\nfossil coniferous stem present a form which naturally suggests a fungus\r\nperithecium. In cases where the black spots on a fossil stem or leaf\r\npossess a definite form and structure, it is perfectly legitimate to\r\nrefer them to a group of fungi; but in very many instances the forms\r\nreferred to such genera as _Sphaerites_ and others are of little or\r\nno value. Many forms of scale-insects and galls on leaves present an\r\nobvious superficial resemblance to epiphyllous fungi, and might readily\r\nbe mistaken for the fructifications of certain Ascomycetous species. As\r\nexamples of scale-insects simulating fungi, reference may be made to\r\nsuch genera of the Coccineae as _Aspidiotus_, _Diaspis_, _Lecanium_,\r\n_Coccus_, and others. The female insects lying on the surface of a\r\nleaf, if preserved as a fossil impression, might easily be mistaken for\r\nperithecia[409].\r\n\r\nAnother pitfall in fossil mycology may be illustrated by a description\r\nof a supposed fungus, _Sclerotites Salisburiae_[410], Mass. on a\r\nTertiary _Ginkgo_ leaf. The figure given by Massalongo represents a\r\n_Ginkgo_ leaf with well marked veins, the lamina between the veins\r\nbeing traversed by short discontinuous and longitudinally-running\r\nlines; the latter are referred to as the fungus. In a recent _Ginkgo_\r\nleaf one may easily detect with the naked eye a number of short lines\r\nbetween and parallel to the veins, which if examined in section\r\nare found to be secretory canals. There can be little doubt that\r\n_Sclerotites Salisburiae_ owes its existence to the preservation of\r\nthese canals.\r\n\r\nThe list of fossil fungi given by Meschinelli in Saccardo’s _Sylloge\r\nFungorum_[411] includes certain species which are of no botanical\r\nvalue, and should have no place in any list which claims to be\r\nauthentic.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous examples of fossil ‘fungi’ which have no claim to\r\nbe classed with plants, there are some which are in all probability\r\nthe galleries of wood-eating animals. The radiating grooves frequently\r\nfound on the inner face of the bark of a pine tree made by species of\r\nthe beetle _Bostrychus_ might be mistaken for the impressions of the\r\nfirm strands of mycelial tissue of some Basidiomycetous fungus.\r\n\r\nIn some notes on fossil fungi by J. F. James[412] contributed to\r\nthe American Journal of Mycology in 1893, it is pointed out that a\r\nsupposed fungus described by Lesquereux from the Lower Coal-Measures\r\nas _Rhizomorpha Sigillariae_[413], bears a strong likeness to some\r\ninsect-burrows, such as those of _Bostrychus_.\r\n\r\n“A new fungus from the Coal-Measures” described by Herzer in 1893[414]\r\nmay probably be referred to animal agency. In any case there is no\r\nevidence as to the fungoid nature of the object represented in the\r\nfigure accompanying Herzer’s description.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BASIDIOMYCETES.]\r\n\r\nMore trustworthy evidence of fossil fungi is afforded by the marks\r\nof disease in petrified tissue and by the presence of true mycelia.\r\nIn examining closely the calcareous and siliceous plant-tissues from\r\nthe Coal-Measures and other geological horizons, one occasionally\r\nsees fine thread-like hyphae ramifying through the cells or tracheal\r\ncavities; in many cases the hyphae bear no reproductive organs and\r\ncannot as a rule be referred to a particular type of fungus. If the\r\nhyphal filaments are unseptate, they most likely belong to some\r\nPhycomycetous species; or if they are obviously septate the Mesomycetes\r\nor the Mycomycetes are the more probable groups. Occasionally there\r\nmay be found indications of the characteristic _clamp-connections_ in\r\nthe septate filaments; a small semicircular branch, which is given off\r\nfrom a mycelium immediately above a transverse wall, bends round to\r\nfuse with the filament just below the septum, thus serving as a small\r\nloop-line connecting the cell-cavity above and below a cross wall. Such\r\nclamp-connections are usually confined to the hyphae of Basidiomycetes\r\nand thus serve as a useful aid in identification. A good example of a\r\nclamp-connection in a fossil mycelium is figured by Conwentz[415] in\r\nhis monograph on the Baltic amber-trees of Oligocene age. The stout\r\nand thick type of hypha found in some fossil woods agrees closely with\r\nthat of _Polyporus_, _Agaricus melleus_ and other well-known recent\r\nBasidiomycetes.\r\n\r\nIn a section of a piece of lignified coniferous wood recently brought\r\nby Col. Feilden from Kolguev island[416], the brown and stout hyphae\r\nof a fungus are clearly seen as distinct dark lines traversing the\r\ntracheal tissue. The occurrence of septa and the large diameter of the\r\nmycelial branches at once suggest a comparison with such recent forms\r\nas _Agaricus melleus_, _Polyporus_ and other Basidiomycetes. The age of\r\nthe Kolguev wood is not known with any certainty.\r\n\r\nThe vesicular swellings such as those represented in fig. 41, A, B, D\r\nand E, may easily be misinterpreted. Such spherical expansions in a\r\nmycelium, either terminal or intercalary, may be sporangia, oogonia or\r\nlarge resting-spores, or non-fungal cell-contents, and it is usually\r\nimpossible in the absence of the contents to determine their precise\r\nnature. Hartig[417] and others have drawn attention to the occurrence\r\nof such bladder-like swellings in the mycelia of recent fungi, which\r\nhave nothing to do with reproductive purposes; under certain conditions\r\nthe hyphae of a fungus growing in the cavity of a cell or trachea may\r\nform such vesicles, and these, as in fig. 42, D, _m_ may completely\r\nfill up the cavity of a large tracheid.\r\n\r\nSome good examples of bladder-like swellings, such as occur in the\r\nmycelium of _Agaricus melleus_ and other recent fungi, have been\r\nfigured by Conwentz[418] in fossil wood of Tertiary age from Karlsdorf.\r\nThe swellings in this fossil fungus might easily be mistaken for\r\noogonia or sporangia; especially as they are few in number and\r\nspherical in form.\r\n\r\nA similar appearance is presented by a mass of tyloses in the cavity of\r\nan old vessel or tracheid; and vesicular cell-contents, as in the cells\r\nof fig. 41, A, 2–5, may closely simulate a number of thin-walled fungal\r\nspores or sporangia.\r\n\r\nA good example of such a vesicular tissue, in addition to that already\r\nquoted, is afforded by a specimen of an Eocene fern, _Osmundites\r\nDowkeri_ Carr.[419] described by Carruthers in 1870. The ground-tissue\r\ncells contain traces of distinct fungal hyphae (fig. 41, B), and in\r\nmany of the parenchymatous elements the cavity is completely filled\r\nwith spherical vesicles; in other cases one finds hyphae in the centre\r\nof the cell while vesicles line the wall, as shewn in fig. 41, B.\r\nCarruthers refers to these bladders as starch grains, and this may\r\nbe their true nature; their appearance and abundant occurrence in\r\nthe parenchyma certainly suggest vesicular cell-contents rather than\r\nfungal cells. I could detect no proof of any connection between the\r\nhyphae and bladders, and the absence of the latter in the cavities of\r\nthe tracheids, fig. 41, C, favoured the view of their being either\r\nstarch-grains or other vacuolated contents similar to that in the cells\r\nof the Portland Cycad (fig. 41, A) referred to on p. 88.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PATHOLOGY OF FOSSIL TISSUES.]\r\n\r\nThe vacuolated cell-contents partially filling the cells in fig. 41, D,\r\npresent a striking resemblance to the contents of the cells 2–5 in fig.\r\n41, A. In fig. D the frothy and contracted substance might be easily\r\nmistaken for a parasitic or saprophytic fungus, but this resemblance\r\nis entirely misleading. It is by no means uncommon to find the cells\r\nof recent plants occupied by such vacuolated contents, especially in\r\ndiseased tissues in which a pathological effect produces an appearance\r\nwhich has more than once misled the most practised observers.\r\n\r\nIn the important work recently published by Renault on the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous flora of Autun, there is a small spore-like body\r\ndescribed as a teleutospore, and classed with the Puccineae[420].\r\nWe have as yet no satisfactory evidence of the existence of this\r\nsection of Fungi in Palaeozoic times, and Renault’s description of\r\n_Teleutospora Milloti_ from Autun might be seriously misleading if\r\naccepted without reference to his figure. The fragment he describes\r\ncannot be accepted as sufficient evidence for the existence of a\r\nPalaeozoic _Puccinia_.\r\n\r\nThe same author refers another Palaeozoic fungus to the Mucorineae\r\nunder the name of _Mucor Combrensis_[421]; this identification is based\r\non a mycelium having a resemblance to the branched thallus of _Mucor_,\r\nbut in the absence of reproductive organs such resemblance is hardly\r\nadequate as a means of recognition.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of hyphal cells in calcareous shells and corals has\r\nalready been alluded to.[422] In addition to the examples referred\r\nto above, there is one which has been described by Etheridge[423]\r\nfrom a Permo-Carboniferous coral. This observer records the occurrence\r\nof tubular cavities in the calices of _Stenopora crinita_ Lonsd.,\r\nand attributes their origin to a fungus which he names _Palaeoperone\r\nendophytica_; he mentions one case in which a tube contains fine\r\nspherical spore-like bodies which he compares with the spores of a\r\n_Saprolegnia_. As pointed out above (p. 128), it is almost impossible\r\nto decide how far these tubes in shells and corals should be attributed\r\nto fungi, and how far to algae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. A.

(After Hartig.)]\r\n\r\nPassing from the direct evidence obtained from the presence of fungal\r\nhyphae in petrified tissues, we must draw attention to the indirect\r\nevidence of fungal action afforded by many fossil plants. It is\r\nimportant to be familiar with at least the more striking effects of\r\nfungal ravages in recent wood in order that we may escape some of the\r\nmistakes to which pathological phenomena may lead us in the case of\r\nfossils[424].\r\n\r\nThe gradual dissociation of the elements in a piece of fossil wood\r\nowing to the destruction of the middle lamellae, the occurrence of\r\nvarious forms of slit-like apertures in the walls of tracheids (fig.\r\n42, E) and the production of a system of fine parallel striation on\r\nthe walls of a vessel are among the results produced by parasitic and\r\nsaprophytic fungi. With the help of a ferment secreted by its hyphae,\r\na fungus is able to eat away either the thickening cell layers or the\r\nmiddle lamellae or both, and if, as in fig. 42, A, only the middle\r\nlamellae are left one might easily regard such tissue in a fossil\r\ncondition as consisting of delicate thin-walled elements. The oblique\r\nstriae on the walls of a tracheid may often be due to the action of a\r\nferment which has dissolved the membrane in such a manner as to etch\r\nout a system of spiral lines, probably as a consequence of the original\r\nstructure of the tracheids. In distinguishing between the woods of\r\nConifers the presence of spiral thickening layers in the wood element\r\nis an important diagnostic character, and it is necessary to guard\r\nagainst the confusion of purely secondary structures, due to fungal\r\naction, with original features which may be of value in determining the\r\ngeneric affinity of a piece of fossil wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Oochytrium Lepidodendri_, Ren. Fig. 43, 1.\r\n\r\nUnder this name Renault has recently described a filamentous fungus\r\nendophytic in the cavities of the scalariform tracheids of a\r\n_Lepidodendron_[425]. The mycelium has the form of slender branched\r\nhyphae with transverse septa. Numerous ovoid and more or less spherical\r\nsporangia occur as terminal swellings of the mycelial threads. The\r\nlong axis of the ovoid forms measures 12–15 µ, and the shorter axis\r\n9–10 µ; the contents may be seen as a slightly contracted mass in the\r\nsporangial cavity. In some of the sporangia one sees a short apical\r\nprolongation in the form of a small elongated papilla, as shown in fig.\r\n43, 1. Renault refers this fungus to the Chytridineae, and compares it\r\nwith _Cladochytrium_, _Woronina_, _Olpidium_, and other recent genera.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of two of the sporangia shown in the\r\nuppermost tracheid of fig. 43, 1, there are seen a few minute dark dots\r\nwhich are described as spores petrified in the act of escaping from a\r\nlateral pore. This interpretation strikes one as lacking in scientific\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia of _Hyphochytrium infestans_[426], as figured by Fischer\r\nin Rabenhorst’s work bear a close resemblance to those of the fossil.\r\nIt would seem very probable that Renault’s species may be reasonably\r\nreferred to the Chytridineae, as he proposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43. 1. _Oochytrium Lepidodendri_, Ren.

(After Felix.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Peronosporites antiquarius_ W. Smith. Fig. 41, E.\r\n\r\nIn an address to the Geologists’ Association delivered by Mr Carruthers\r\nin 1876 a brief reference, accompanied by a small-scale drawing, is\r\nmade to the discovery of a fungus in the scalariform tracheids of a\r\n_Lepidodendron_ from the English Coal-Measures[427]. In the following\r\nyear Worthington Smith published a fuller account of the fungus, and\r\nproposed for it the above name[428], which he chose on the ground of\r\na close similarity between the mycelium and reproductive organs of\r\nthe fossil form and recent members of the Peronosporeae. In Smith’s\r\ndescription the mycelium is described as bearing spherical swellings\r\ncontaining zoospores. These spherical organs are fairly abundant and\r\nnot infrequently met with in sections of petrified plant-tissues from\r\nthe English Coal-Measures; they may be oogonia or sporangia, or in\r\nsome cases mere vesicular expansions of a purely vegetative hypha.\r\nNo confirmation has been given to the supposed spores referred to\r\nby Smith. Prof. Williamson and others have carefully examined the\r\nspecimens, but they have failed to detect any trace of reproductive\r\ncells enclosed in the spherical sacs[429]. The mycelium does not appear\r\nto show any satisfactory evidence of its being septate as figured by\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nThe example shown in fig. 41 E has been drawn from one of the\r\nWilliamson specimens: it illustrates the form and manner of occurrence\r\nof the characteristic swellings. It is probable that some at least\r\nof the vesicles are either sporangia or oogonia, but we cannot speak\r\nwith absolute confidence as to their precise nature. The general\r\nhabit and structure of the fungus favour its inclusion in the class\r\nof _Phycomycetes_. The occurrence of several of the vesicles close\r\ntogether on short hyphal branches, as shown in Williamson’s figures,\r\nsuggests the spherical swellings on vegetative hyphae, but it is\r\nimpossible to speak with absolute confidence. There is a close\r\nresemblance between this English form and one recently described by\r\nRenault as _Palaeomyces gracilis_ Ren.[430]; the two fossils should\r\nprobably be placed in the same genus.\r\n\r\nThe examples referred to below and originally recorded by Cash and Hick\r\nno doubt belong to the same type as Smith’s _Peronosporites_.\r\n\r\nThe sketches reproduced in fig. 44 have been drawn from specimens\r\noriginally described by Cash and Hick in 1878[431]. The sections were\r\ncut from a calcareous nodule from the Halifax Coal-Measures containing\r\nfragments of various plants and among others a piece of cortical\r\ntissue, probably of a _Lepidodendron_ or _Stigmaria_. In a transverse\r\nsection of this tissue one sees under a moderately high power that\r\nthe cells have become partially separated from one another by the\r\ndestruction of the middle lamellae (fig. 44 A). The cell-cavities and\r\nthe spaces between the isolated cells contain numerous fine fungal\r\nhyphae, which here and there terminate in spherical swellings. One\r\nsuch swelling is shown under a low power in fig. 44 A, in the middle\r\nuppermost cell, and more highly magnified in fig. 44 B. In fig. C\r\nthere are two such swellings (the larger one having a diameter of ·003\r\nmm.) in contact, but the connection does not appear to be organic.\r\nThe cell-walls of the infected tissue present a ragged and untidy\r\nappearance, and in places (_e.g._ fig. 44 D) the membrane has been\r\npierced by some of the mycelial branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44. Cells with fungal hyphae. A. A piece of\r\n  disorganised tissue, showing the separation of the cells. B. Part\r\n  of A more highly magnified. C. A single cell containing two swollen\r\n  hyphae. D. Partially destroyed cell-membranes pierced by fungal\r\n  hyphae. (Drawn from sections in the Edinburgh Botanical Museum,\r\n  originally described by Cash and Hick.)]\r\n\r\nThis fungus bears a close resemblance to _Peronosporites antiquarius_,\r\nbut it is impossible to determine its precise botanical position\r\nwithout further data. In Cash and Hick’s paper in which the above\r\nfungus is briefly dealt with, some small spore-like bodies are figured\r\nwhich the authors speak of as possibly a Myxomycetous fungus[432].\r\nThere is however no sound reason for such a supposition.\r\n\r\nAs examples of Ascomycetous fungi found in silicified wood of Tertiary\r\nage, two species may be quoted from Felix.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Cladosporites bipartitus_ Felix[433], fig. 43, 3.\r\n\r\nThe mycelium and conidia of this form were discovered in some Eocene\r\nsilicified wood from Perekeschkul near Baku, on the shores of the\r\nCaspian. The conidia are elliptical or pyriform in shape and divided by\r\na transverse septum into two cells. No traces were found of any special\r\nconidiophores. The mycelium consists of septate branched hyphae,\r\nrendered conspicuous by a brown colouration. Felix compares the fossil\r\nwith the recent genera _Cephalothecium_ and _Cladosporium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Haplographites cateniger_ Felix[434], fig. 43, 4.\r\n\r\nThe conidia of this form were found to be fairly abundant in the\r\nsilicified tissue investigated by Felix; they occur usually in chains\r\nof 2 to 6 conidia having an ovoid or flask-shaped form, with a thick\r\nmembrane (fig. 43, 4). The mycelium consists of branched hyphae divided\r\ninto long cylindrical cells by transverse septa; occasional instances\r\nwere found of an H-shaped fusion between lateral branches of parallel\r\nhyphae.\r\n\r\nFelix compares this species with examples of the genera _Haptographium_\r\nand _Dematium_ of the family Sphaeriaceae; it was found in the woody\r\ntissue of a dicotyledonous stem from Perekeschkul.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Zygosporites_ sp.\r\n\r\nThe object represented in fig. 41 F consists of a stalked spherical\r\nsac bearing a number of radiating arms which are divided distally\r\ninto delicate terminations. We find similar bodies figured by\r\nWilliamson[435] in his IXth and Xth Memoirs on the Coal-Measure plants;\r\nhe includes some of them under the generic term _Zygosporites_, and\r\ncompares them with the zygospores of the freshwater algae Desmideae.\r\nHitherto these spore-like fossils have only been recorded as isolated\r\nspheres, but in the example shown in fig. 41 F there is a distinct\r\ntubular and thin-walled stalk attached to the _Zygosporites_. The\r\nspecimen was found in the partially disorganised cortical tissue of a\r\n_Lyginodendron_ stem from the English Coal-Measures. It is difficult\r\nto decide as to the precise nature of the fossil, but the presence of\r\nthe hyphal stalk points to a fungus rather than an alga as the most\r\nprobable type of plant with which to connect it. It may possibly be a\r\nsporangium of a fungus comparable with the common mould _Mucor_, or it\r\nmay be a zygospore formed by the conjugation of two hyphae of which\r\nonly one has been preserved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POLYPORUS.]\r\n\r\nFor an example of a fossil representative of the Basidiomycetes we may\r\nturn to the excellent monograph by Conwentz on the Baltic amber trees,\r\nand quote one of the forms which he has described.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Polyporus vaporarius_ Fr. _f. succinea_[436], fig. 43, 2.\r\n\r\nIn several preparations of the wood preserved by petrifaction in amber\r\nConwentz found distinct indications of the ravages of a fungus, which\r\nsuggested the presence of the recent species _Polyporus vaporarius_ Fr.\r\nWith the help of the indirect evidence afforded by the pathological\r\neffects as seen in the tissues of the host-plant, and the direct\r\nevidence of the fungal mycelium Conwentz was led to this identification.\r\n\r\nThe mycelium is brown in colour, in part thick-walled, and in part with\r\nthin walls, transversely septate and not much branched. In the portion\r\nof one of Conwentz’ figures reproduced in fig. 43, 2, the rents and\r\nholes in the tracheid walls are clearly shown; they afford the indirect\r\nevidence of fungal attacks, and are of the same nature as those shown\r\nin fig. 42, B, C and E.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to call attention to the paucity of exact data on\r\nwhich to generalise as to the geological history of fungi. The types\r\nselected for description or passing allusion have not been chosen in\r\neach case because of their special intrinsic value, but rather as\r\nconvenient examples by which to illustrate authentic records or to\r\nserve as warnings against possible sources of error.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that we have fairly good and conclusive evidence of the\r\nexistence in Permo-Carboniferous times of Phycomycetous fungi, but\r\nit is not until we pass to post-Palaeozoic or even Tertiary plants\r\nthat we discover satisfactory representatives of the higher fungi or\r\nMycomycetes. If special attention were paid to the investigation of\r\nfossil fungi, it is quite possible that our knowledge of the past\r\nhistory of the group might be considerably extended. It is essential\r\nthat the greatest caution should be exercised in the identification\r\nof forms and in their reference to definite families; otherwise our\r\nlists of fossil species will serve to mislead, and to emphasize the\r\nuntrustworthy character of palaeobotanical data. Unless we feel\r\nsatisfied as to the position of a fossil fungus it is unwise to use\r\na generic term suggestive of a definite family or recent genus. Such\r\na name as Renault has used in one instance, _Palaeomyces_, might be\r\nemployed as a useful and comprehensive designation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           VII. CHAROPHYTA.\r\n\r\n                          CHARACEÆ. NITELLEÆ.\r\n\r\nIt has been the general custom to include the Characeæ or Stoneworts\r\namong the Chlorophyceae (green algae), of which they form a distinctly\r\nisolated family. On the whole, it would seem better to follow the\r\ncourse lately adopted by Migula[437] and allow the Characeæ to rank\r\nas a family of a distinct group, Charophyta. While agreeing in many\r\nrespects with plants higher in the scale than Thallophytes, the\r\nStoneworts do not sufficiently resemble the Bryophyta to be included in\r\nthat group.\r\n\r\nThe Charophyta are plants containing chlorophyll, living in fresh and\r\nbrackish water; the stem is jointed, and bears at the nodes whorls of\r\nleaves, on which are borne the reproductive organs. The antheridia\r\nare spherical in shape and of complex structure, containing numerous\r\nbiciliate antherozoids. The oogonia are oval in form and contain a\r\nsingle large egg-cell. The Chara-plant is developed from a _protonema_\r\nformed from the germinating oospore. Vegetative reproduction is\r\neffected by means of bulbils, accessory shoots, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Nitelleæ have not been recognised in a fossil condition. The\r\nabsence or feeble development of a calcareous incrustation renders the\r\ngenera of this family less likely to be preserved than such a genus as\r\n_Chara_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chareae.\r\n\r\nLeaves and stems with or without a cortical investment. Fruit with a\r\nfive-celled _corona_. The envelope of the ‘fruit’ and other parts of\r\nthe plant are frequently encrusted with carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Chara_, the best known member of the family, the plant as\r\na whole resembles in its general habit and external differentiation of\r\nparts the higher plants. The stem consists of long internodes separated\r\nby short nodes bearing whorls of leaves. Each internode consists of\r\na long cylindrical cell, which becomes enclosed by a cortical sheath\r\ncomposed of rows of cells which have grown upwards and downwards from\r\nthe peripheral nodal cells. The cortical cells are usually spirally\r\ntwisted and impart to the stem a characteristic appearance; they\r\nare divided by transverse walls into numerous cells some of which\r\noccasionally grow out into short processes (fig. 45 _c_). The leaves\r\nrepeat on a smaller scale the structural features of the stem, but\r\npossess a limited growth, whereas the stem has an unlimited power\r\nof growth by means of a large hemispherical apical cell. Branches\r\narise in the axils of the leaves. The plants are either monoecious or\r\ndioecious. The oogonium is elliptical in shape, and is borne on a short\r\nstalk-cell, it contains a single oosphere. The wall of the oogonium is\r\nformed of five spirally twisted cells which have grown over it from the\r\nfive peripheral cells of a leaf-node. The tips of the investing cells\r\nproject at the apex in the form of a terminal crown or _corona_ (fig.\r\n45, _E_, _c_). The antheridia have a complex structure, and produce a\r\nvery large number of motile antherozoids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45. _A_ and _B_. _Chara Knowltoni_ Sew. From a\r\n  section in the British Museum. _C._ Stem of _Chara foetida_ A.\r\n  Br. in transverse section (after Migula. × 18). _D._ Interior of\r\n  oogonium of _C. foetida_. _E._ Oogonium of _C. foetida_ (_D_ and\r\n  _E_ after Migula. × 50).]\r\n\r\nAfter fertilisation, the egg-cell becomes surrounded by a membrane, at\r\nfirst colourless, but afterwards yellow or brown. The inner cell-walls\r\nof the cells surrounding the oospore become thicker and darker in\r\ncolour; the outer walls remain thin and eventually fall away. The\r\nlateral walls may or may not become thickened. In most of the Chareae a\r\ncalcareous deposit is formed between the hard shell and the outer walls\r\nof the cells enveloping the oospore. This calcareous shell is developed\r\nsubsequently to the thickening and hardening of the inner walls of the\r\nfruit-case. The cells of the corona and stalk do not become calcareous.\r\nIn the fossil Charas, it is this calcareous shell that is preserved.\r\nIn the members of the Chareae the stems are usually encrusted with\r\ncarbonate of lime, and thus have a much better chance of preservation\r\nthan the slightly calcareous Nitelleæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Chara._\r\n\r\nThe generic characters have already been described in the brief account\r\nof the family Chareae.\r\n\r\nThe generic name was proposed by Vaillant in 1719[438], and adopted by\r\nLinnaeus, who classed the Stoneworts with aquatic phanerogams. As long\r\nago as 1623[439] a figure of _Chara_ was published by Caspar Bauhin\r\nas a form of _Equisetum_. The generic name _Chara_ has usually been\r\napplied to recent and fossil species alike. The existing species have\r\na wide distribution; _Chara foetida_, A. Br., a common British form,\r\noccurs in practically all parts of the world. Stems and calcareous\r\n‘fruit-cases’ occur fairly commonly in a fossil state, and differ but\r\nlittle from recent species, at least as regards essential features.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say at what geological horizon the Stoneworts\r\nare first represented. The first certain traces of _Chara_ occur in\r\nJurassic rocks, but certain spirally marked subspherical bodies have\r\nbeen recorded from Devonian and Carboniferous strata, which closely\r\nresemble Chara oogonia, and may be Palaeozoic representatives of the\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Mr Knowlton[440] of the American Geological Survey described\r\nsome ‘problematic organisms’ found in Devonian rocks at the falls of\r\nthe Ohio. Examples of these fossils are shown in fig. 46 _b_ and _c_;\r\nthe spirally grooved body measures from 1·50 to 1·80 mm. in diameter,\r\nand about 1·70 mm. in length. The Chara-like character of the fossils\r\nhad been previously suggested by Meek[441] in 1873. Without going into\r\nthe arguments for or against placing these fossils in the Chareae,\r\nthey may at least be mentioned as possible but not certain Palaeozoic\r\nforms of _Chara_ or an allied genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46. _a_. _Chara Bleicheri_ Sap. × 30. _b_ and _c_.\r\n  Devonian _Chara_? sp. _circa_ × 12. _d_ and _e_. _Chara Wrighti_\r\n  Forbes. _circa_ × 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\n             1. _Chara Bleicheri_, Saporta. Fig. 46, _a_.\r\n\r\nIn this form the ‘fruits’ are minute and subspherical, ·39-·44 mm.\r\nlong, and ·35-·40 mm. broad, showing in side view 5–6 slightly oblique\r\nspiral bands. Each spiral band bears a row of slightly projecting\r\ntubercles.\r\n\r\nThis species was first described by Saporta[442] from the Oxfordian\r\n(Jurassic) rocks of the Department of Lot in France; it is compared by\r\nthe author of the species with _Chara Jaccardi_ Heer, described by Heer\r\nfrom the Upper Jurassic rocks of Switzerland.\r\n\r\n     2. _C. Knowltoni_, Seward. Fig. 45, _a_ and _b_, and Fig. 47.\r\n\r\nThe Oogonia are broadly oval, about ·5mm. in length, and at the\r\nbroadest part of about the same breadth. The surface is marked by\r\neleven or twelve bands in the form of a flattened spiral. The stems\r\npossess investing cortical cells.\r\n\r\nThis species was founded on specimens from the Wealden beds of\r\nSussex[443], but numerous examples of Chara ‘fruits’ and stems have\r\nlong been known from the uppermost Jurassic rocks of the Dorset coast\r\nand the Isle of Wight, which may probably be included in this species.\r\nThese fossil Charas are abundant[444] in the Chert beds of Purbeck age\r\nseen in the cliffs near Swanage. Pieces of corticated stems from this\r\nlocality are represented in fig. 45 _A_ and _B_.\r\n\r\nThe cortical cells surrounding a large internodal cell are very clearly\r\nseen in the section shown in fig. 45 _B_, and in the longitudinal view\r\nin fig. 45 _A_. The resemblance of these specimens to the stems of\r\nrecent Stoneworts is very striking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. _Chara Knowltoni_, Sew. × 30.]\r\n\r\nThe single oogonium of fig. 47 was found in the Wealden beds near\r\nHastings.\r\n\r\n\r\n           3. _Chara Wrighti_, Forbes. Fig. 46, _d_ and _e_.\r\n\r\nThis species is characterised by globular or somewhat elliptical\r\noogonia, with six or seven spiral bands.\r\n\r\nIt is very abundant in the Lower Headon beds of Hordwell Cliffs on the\r\nHampshire coast[445]. Various species of _Chara_ are commonly met with\r\nin the Oligocene beds of the Isle of Wight and Hampshire, as well as\r\nin the Paris basin beds, and elsewhere. Well preserved ‘fruits’ and\r\nstem fragments are met with in a siliceous rock of Upper Oligocene age\r\nimported from Montmorency in the Paris basin, and used as a stone for\r\ngrinding phosphates at some chemical works near Upware, a few miles\r\nfrom Cambridge.\r\n\r\nMany other species of fossil Charas are known from various horizons\r\nand localities, but the above examples suffice as illustrative types.\r\nIn Post-Tertiary deposits masses of _Chara_ and plant fragments\r\noccasionally occur forming blocks of Travertine. Examples of such Chara\r\nbeds have been recorded by Sharpe from Northampton[446], by Lyell[447]\r\nfrom Forfarshire, and by other writers from several other districts.\r\nBeds of calcareous marl are occasionally seen as whitish streaks in the\r\npeat of the Fenland[448]; these often consist in great part of Charas.\r\nA season’s growth of _Chara_ in a shallow lake or mere in the Fens may\r\nappear as a white line in a section of peaty and other material which\r\nhas been formed on the site of old pools or lakes.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of specific characters in the isolated Chara ‘fruits’\r\nusually met with in a fossil state is exceedingly unsatisfactory; the\r\nfeatures usually relied on in the living species are not preserved, and\r\ngreat care should be taken in the separation of the various forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                        BRYOPHYTA (Muscineae).\r\n\r\n            I. HEPATICAE (Liverworts). II. MUSCI (Mosses).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bryophyta are small plants, varying in size from 1 mm. to about\r\n30 cm., creeping or erect, having a thalloid, or more usually a\r\nfoliose body, consisting of a cell-mass exhibiting in most cases a\r\ndistinct internal differentiation. They possess no true roots and no\r\ntrue vascular tissue. The life-history of the members of the group is\r\ncharacterised by a well-marked and definite alternation of generations.\r\nThe Moss or Liverwort plant is the sexual generation (_gametophyte_),\r\nand as a result of the fertilisation of an egg-cell the asexual or\r\nspore-bearing generation (_sporophyte_) is produced. The sporophyte\r\nnever exhibits a differentiation into stem and leaves. Asexual and\r\nvegetative reproduction are effected by means of spores, bulbils, or\r\ndetached portions of the plant-body. Sexual reproduction is by means of\r\nbiciliate antherozoids produced in _antheridia_ and egg-cells formed\r\nsingly in _archegonia_.\r\n\r\nIn the Bryophytes the distinguishing characteristics are more\r\nconstant and well-defined than in the Thallophytes. In the former the\r\nplant never consists of a single cell or coenocyte, but is always\r\nmulticellular, and exhibits in most cases a definite physiological\r\ndivision of labour as expressed in the histological differentiation\r\nof distinct tissue-systems. In the Thallophytes there is no true\r\nalternation of generation in the same sense as in the Mosses and\r\nLiverworts and in the higher plants. In the Bryophytes the sexual\r\nreproduction has reached a higher stage of development and a much\r\ngreater constancy as regards the nature of the reproductive organs. On\r\nthe germination of the spore there is usually formed a fairly distinct\r\nstructure known as the _protonema_, from which the Moss or Liverwort\r\ndevelopes as a bud[449].\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ╭ MARCHANTIALES.\r\n          I. HEPATICAE. ┤ ANTHOCEROTALES.\r\n                        ╰ JUNGERMANNIALES.\r\n\r\nThe vegetative plant-body possesses a different organisation on the\r\nventral and dorsal side; it has the form of a thalloid creeping plant\r\n(Thalloid Liverworts), or of a delicate stem with thin appendages or\r\nleaves without a midrib (Foliose Liverworts). In most cases the body\r\nof the plant is made up of parenchymatous tissue, showing but little\r\ninternal differentiation; in one or two genera a few strengthening or\r\nmechanical fibres occur among the thinner walled ground-tissue. On the\r\ngermination of the spore, a feebly developed protonema is produced,\r\nwhich gives rise to the Liverwort plant. Reproduction as in the group\r\nBryophyta.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DETERMINATION OF LIVERWORTS.]\r\n\r\nThe Liverworts have a very wide geographical distribution, and are\r\nspecially abundant in moist shady situations; they grow on stones\r\nor damp soil, and occur as epiphytes on other plants. _Marchantia_,\r\n_Pellia_, and _Jungermannia_ are among the better known British\r\nrepresentatives of the class.\r\n\r\nConsidering the soft nature of the body of recent Liverworts, it is\r\nnot surprising that they are poorly represented in a fossil state. In\r\nthe absence of the sexual reproductive organs, or of the sporophytes,\r\nwhich have scarcely ever been preserved, exact identification is almost\r\nhopeless. The difficulties already referred to in dealing with the\r\nalgae, as regards the misleading similarity between the form of the\r\nthallus and the bodies of other plants, have to be faced in the case of\r\nthe Liverworts. Many of the thalloid Liverworts, if preserved in the\r\nform of a cast or impression without internal structure or reproductive\r\norgans, could hardly be distinguished from various genera of algae\r\nin which the thallus has the form of a forked plate-like body. Such\r\ngenera as _Pellia_, _Marchantia_, _Lunularia_, _Reboulia_, and others\r\nbear a striking resemblance to _Fucus_, _Chondrus_ and many other algae.\r\n\r\nImperfect specimens of certain Lichens, not to mention some of\r\nthe Polyzoa, might easily be mistaken for Liverworts. Among the\r\nhigher plants, there are some forms of the _Podostemaceae_ which\r\nsimulate in habit both thalloid and foliose Liverworts as well as\r\nMosses[450]. The members of this Dicotyledonous family are described\r\nas water-plants with a Moss- or Liverwort-like form; they occur on\r\nrocks in quickly-flowing water in the tropics. In one instance a\r\nrecent Podostemaceous genus has been described as a member of the\r\nAnthocerotales; the genus _Blandowia_[451], referred to by Willdenow as\r\na Liverwort, has since been recognised as one of the _Podostemaceae_.\r\nThe resemblance between some of the foliose _Hepaticae_ and genera\r\nof Mosses is often very close. In certain Mosses, such as _Hookeria\r\npennata_[452], the large two-ranked leaves suggest the branches of a\r\n_Selaginella_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48. A. _Tristichia hypnoides_ Spreng. From a\r\n  specimen in the British Museum. B. _Podocarpus cupressina_ Br.\r\n  and Ben. (After Brown and Bennett[453].) C. _Selaginella Oregana_\r\n  Eat. From a plant in the Cambridge Botanic Garden. A, B and C very\r\n  slightly reduced.]\r\n\r\nThe plant reproduced in fig. 48 A (_Tristichia_), one of the\r\nPodostemaceae, might easily be mistaken for a foliose Liverwort if\r\nfound as a fragmentary fossil. Such species of _Selaginella_ as _S.\r\nOregana_ Eat. and _S. rupestris_ Spring (fig. 48 C) have a distinctly\r\nmoss-like habit and do not present a very obvious resemblance to the\r\nmore typical and better known Selaginellas. The twig of a _Podocarpus_\r\n(_P. cupressina_)[454] in fig. 48 B affords an instance of a conifer\r\nwhich simulates to some extent certain of the larger-leaved Liverworts;\r\nit bears a resemblance also to some fossil fragments referred to\r\n_Selaginellites_ or _Lycopodites_. A small fossil specimen figured by\r\nNathorst[455] from Japan as possibly a _Lycopodites_ may be compared\r\nwith a coniferous twig, and with some of the larger Liverworts, _e.g._\r\nspecies of _Plagiochila_[456]. _Podocarpus cupressina_ is, however,\r\nchiefly instructive as an example of the striking differences which are\r\nmet with among species of the same genus; it differs considerably from\r\nthe ordinary species of _Podocarpus_, and might well be identified as a\r\nmember of some other group than that of the Coniferae.\r\n\r\nWe have no records of Palaeozoic Hepaticae. The fossils which Zeiller\r\nhas figured in his _Flore de Brive_ as _Schizopteris dichotoma_\r\nGümb.[457] and _S. trichomanoides_ Göpp. bear a resemblance to some\r\nforms of hepatics, but there is no satisfactory evidence for removing\r\nthem from the position assigned to them by the French writer. In\r\nMesozoic rocks a few specimens are known which bear a close resemblance\r\nas regards the form of the thalloid body to recent Liverworts, but\r\nthe identification of such fossils cannot be absolutely trusted. Two\r\nFrench authors, MM. Fliche and Bleicher[458], have described a plant\r\nfrom Lower Oolite rocks near Nancy as a species of _Marchantia_,\r\n_M. oolithus_, but they point out the close agreement of such\r\nforked laminar structures to algae and lichens. From Tertiary and\r\nPost-Tertiary beds a certain number of fossil species have been\r\nrecorded, but they possess no special botanical interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ORDER MARCHANTIALES.\r\n\r\nThe plant-body is always thalloid, bearing rhizoids on the lower\r\nsurface, and having an epidermis with pores limiting the upper or\r\ndorsal surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Marchantites._\r\n\r\nThis convenient generic name was proposed by Brongniart in 1849[459];\r\nit may be briefly defined as follows:\r\n\r\n  Vegetative body of laminar form, with apparently dichotomous\r\n  branches, and agreeing in habit with the recent thalloid Hepaticae,\r\n  as represented by such a genus as _Marchantia_.\r\n\r\nThe name _Marchantites_ is preferable to _Marchantia_, as the latter\r\nimplies identity with the recent genus, whereas the former is used in a\r\nwide sense and refers rather to a definite form of vegetative body than\r\nto a particular generic type.\r\n\r\n1. _Marchantites erectus_ (Leckenby). Fig. 49. This species may be\r\ndescribed as follows: The thalloid body is divided into spreading\r\ndichotomously branched segments, obtusely pointed apically. The\r\nslightly wrinkled surface shows a distinct and comparatively broad\r\ndarker and shorter median band, with lighter coloured and thinner\r\nmargins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49. _Marchantites erectus_ (Leck.). From the\r\n  type-specimen in the Woodwardian Museum. Nat. size.]\r\n\r\nIn 1864 Leckenby described this plant from the Lower Oolite beds\r\nof the Yorkshire coast near Scarborough, as _Fucoides erectus_,\r\nregarding it as a fossil alga. I recently pointed out that the general\r\nappearance and mode of occurrence of the specimens suggest a liverwort\r\nrather than an alga, and proposed the substitution of the genus\r\n_Marchantites_[460]. It would, however, be unwise to speak with any\r\ngreat confidence as to the real affinities of the fossil.\r\n\r\nThe example shown in the figure is the type-specimen of Leckenby[461]:\r\nthe breadth of the branches is about 3 mm. Under a low magnifying power\r\nthe surface shows distinct and somewhat oblique wrinklings, the general\r\nappearance being very similar to that of some recent forms of the genus\r\n_Marchantia_.\r\n\r\nA closely allied species has recently been described from the\r\nWealden beds of Ecclesbourne, near Hastings, on the Sussex coast, as\r\n_Marchantites Zeilleri_ Sew.[462].\r\n\r\nIn a recent monograph on Jurassic plants from Poland, apparently\r\ncontaining much that is of the greatest value, but which is\r\nunfortunately written in the Polish language, Raciborski[463] describes\r\na new species of thalloid Liverwort under the name of _Paleohepatica\r\nRostafinski_. The specimens are barren plants larger than any Jurassic\r\nspecies hitherto described; they agree closely in habit with Saporta’s\r\nTertiary species _Marchantites Sezannensis_.\r\n\r\n2. _Marchantites Sezannensis Saporta._ Fig. 50. The body is broadly\r\nlinear and dichotomously branched, with a somewhat undulating margin.\r\nMidrib on the dorsal surface depressed, but more prominent on the\r\nventral surface. The upper surface is divided into hexagonal areas, in\r\neach of which occurs a central pore. There are two rows of scales along\r\nthe median line on the lower surface. Stalked male receptacles.\r\n\r\nBrongniart[464] first mentioned this fossil hepatic, which was found in\r\nthe calcareous travertine of Sézanne of Oligocene age in the Province\r\nof Marne. The specimens figured by Saporta[465] show very clearly\r\nthe characters of one of the _Marchantiaceae_, and in this case we\r\nhave the additional evidence of the characteristic male receptacles\r\nwhich are given off from a point towards the apex of the lobes, and\r\narise from a slight median depression. In one of Saporta’s figures\r\n(reproduced in fig. 50 _A_) there are represented some median scars\r\nwhich may mark the position of cups similar to those which occur on\r\nrecent species of _Marchantia_, and in which gemmæ or bulbils are\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50. _Marchantites Sezannensis_ Sap. _A._ Surface\r\n  view of the thallus; _g_, ? cups with gemmæ. _B._ A male branch.\r\n  _C._ A portion of _A_ magnified to show the surface features.\r\n  (After Saporta.)]\r\n\r\nThe collection of Sézanne fossils in the Sorbonne includes some very\r\nbeautiful casts of _Marchantites_ in which the structural details\r\nare preserved much more perfectly than in the examples described by\r\nSaporta. In a few specimens which Prof. Munier-Chalmas recently showed\r\nme the reproductive branches were exceedingly well shown. The fossils\r\noccur as moulds in the travertine, and the museum specimens are in the\r\nform of plaster-casts taken from the natural moulds.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Liverworts belonging to the Marchantiales and\r\nJungermanniales have been recorded from the amber of North Germany,\r\nof Oligocene age. These appear to be represented by small fragments,\r\nsuch as are figured by Göppert and Berendt[466] in their monograph\r\non the amber plants, published in 1845. The determinations have since\r\nbeen revised by Gottsche[467], who recognises species of _Frullania_,\r\n_Jungermannia_, and other genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ╭ SPHAGNALES.\r\n              II. MUSCI.  ┤ ANDREAEALES.\r\n                          ╰ BRYALES.\r\n\r\nThe plant-body (gametophyte) in the Musci consists of a stem bearing\r\nthin leaves, usually spirally disposed, rarely in two rows. The\r\ninternal differentiation of the stem is generally well marked, and\r\nin some cases is comparable in complexity with the structure of the\r\nhigher plants. A protonema arises from the spore, having the form of a\r\nbranched filamentous, or more rarely a thalloid structure. Reproduction\r\nas in the group Bryophyta.\r\n\r\nMosses like Liverworts have an extremely wide distribution, and occur\r\nin various habitats. In many districts vast tracts of country are\r\npractically monopolised by peat-forming genera, such as _Sphagnum_ and\r\nother Mosses. Some genera are found on rocks at high altitudes in dry\r\nregions, a few grow as saprophytes, and many occur either as epiphytes\r\non the leaves and stems of other plants, or carpeting the ground under\r\nthe shade of forest trees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DETERMINATION OF MOSSES.]\r\n\r\nIn the simpler Mosses, the stem consists of a parenchymatous\r\nground-tissue with a few outer layers of thicker-walled and smaller\r\ncells. In others there is a distinct central cylinder which occupies\r\nthe axis of the stem, and consists of long and narrow cells; in the\r\nmore complex forms the structure of the axial tissues suggests the\r\ncentral cylinder or _stele_ of higher plants. The genus _Polytrichum_,\r\nso abundant on English moors, illustrates this higher type of stem\r\ndifferentiation. In a transverse section of the stem the peripheral\r\ntissue is seen to be composed of thick-walled cells, passing internally\r\ninto large parenchymatous tissue. The axial part is occupied by a\r\ndefinite central cylinder consisting in the centre of elongated\r\nelements with dark-coloured and thick walls having thin transverse\r\nsepta; surrounding this central tissue there are thinner walled\r\nelements, of which some closely agree in form with the sieve-tubes of\r\nthe higher plants. The central tissue may be regarded as a rudimentary\r\ntype of xylem, and the surrounding tissue as a rudimentary phloem. Each\r\nleaf is traversed by a median conducting strand which passes into the\r\nstem and eventually becomes connected with the axial cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe fertilisation of the egg-cell gives rise to the development of a\r\nlong slender stalk terminating distally in a large spore-capsule. In\r\nsection the stalk or seta closely resembles the leafy axis of the moss\r\nplant. Considering the fairly close approach of some of the mosses to\r\nthe higher plants as regards histological characters, it is conceivable\r\nthat imperfectly petrified stems of fossil mosses might be mistaken for\r\ntwigs of Vascular Cryptogams.\r\n\r\nLike Liverworts, Mosses have left very few traces of their existence\r\nin plant-bearing rocks. Without the aid of the characteristic\r\nmoss-‘fruit’ or sporogonium it is almost impossible to recognise\r\nfossil moss-plant fragments. In species of the tropical genera\r\n_Spiridens_ and _Dawsonia_, e.g. _S. longifolius_[468] Lind. or _D.\r\nsuperba_[469] Grev. and _D. polytrichoides_[470] R. Br., the plant\r\nreaches a considerable length, and resembles twigs of plants higher in\r\nthe scale than the Bryophytes. The finer branches of species of the\r\nextinct genus _Lepidodendron_ are extremely moss-like in appearance.\r\nAgain, _Cyathophyllum bulbosum_ Muell[471], with its two kinds of\r\nleaves arranged in rows, is not at all unlike species of _Selaginella_\r\nor the hepatic genus _Gottschea_. It is by no means improbable that\r\nsome of the Palaeozoic specimens described as twigs of _Lycopodites_,\r\n_Selaginites_, or _Lepidodendron_, may be portions of mosses. The\r\nfertile branches of _Lycopodium phlegmaria_ in a fossil condition might\r\nbe easily mistaken for fragments of a moss. In some conifers with\r\nsmall and crowded scale-leaves there is a certain resemblance to the\r\nstouter forms of moss stems. Such possible sources of error should be\r\nprominently kept in view when we are considering the value of negative\r\nevidence as regards the geological history of the Musci.\r\n\r\nA recent writer[472] on mosses has expressed the opinion that no doubt\r\nthe Musci played an exceedingly important rôle in past time. Although\r\nwe have no proof that this was so, yet it is far from improbable, and\r\nthe absence of fossil mosses must no doubt be attributed in part to\r\ntheir failure to be preserved in a fossil state.\r\n\r\nIn the numerous samples of Coal-Measure vegetation preserved in\r\nextraordinary perfection in the calcareous nodules of England, no\r\ncertain trace of a moss has so far been discovered. The most delicate\r\ntissue in the larger Palaeozoic plants has often been preserved, and\r\nin view of such possibilities of petrifaction it might appear strange\r\nthat if moss-like plants existed no fragments had been preserved.\r\nTheir absence is, however, no proof of the non-existence of Palaeozoic\r\nmosses, but it is a fact which certainly tends towards the assumption\r\nthat mosses were probably not very abundant in the Coal Period forests.\r\nEpiphytic mosses frequently occur on the stems and leaves of ferns\r\nand other plants in tropical forests. Such small and comparatively\r\ndelicate plants would, however, be easily rubbed off or destroyed in\r\nthe process of fossilisation, and it is extremely rare to find among\r\npetrified Palaeozoic plants the external features well preserved. It is\r\nprobable that the forests extended over low lying and swampy regions,\r\nand that, in part, the trees were rooted in a submerged surface. Under\r\nsuch conditions of growth there would not be the same abundance of\r\nBryophytes as in most of our modern forests.\r\n\r\nTo whatever cause the absence of mosses may be best attributed, it is\r\na fact that should not be too strongly emphasised in discussions on\r\nplant-evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Muscites._\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive genus may be defined as follows:—\r\n\r\nStem filiform, simple or branched, bearing small sessile leaves, with\r\na delicate lamina, without veins or with a single median vein, arranged\r\nin a spiral manner on the stem.\r\n\r\n_Muscites_[473] is one of those convenient generic designations\r\nwhich limited knowledge and incomplete data render necessary in\r\npalaeontology. Fossil plants which in their general habit bear a\r\nsufficiently striking resemblance to recent mosses, may be included\r\nunder this generic name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51. _Muscites polytrichaceus_ Ren. and Zeill.\r\n  (after Renault and Zeiller).]\r\n\r\n1. _Muscites polytrichaceus_ Renault and Zeiller. In this species\r\nthe stems are about 3–4 cm. long and 1·3 m. broad, usually simple,\r\nbut sometimes giving off a few branches, and marked externally by\r\nvery delicate longitudinal grooves. The leaves are alternate, closely\r\narranged, lanceolate, with an acute apex, gradually narrowed towards\r\nthe base, 1–2 mm. long, traversed by a single median vein.\r\n\r\nOne of the French specimens, on which the species was founded[474],\r\nis shown in fig. 51, and the form of the leaves is more clearly seen\r\nin the small enlarged piece of stem. The authors of the species point\r\nout that the tufted habit of the specimens, their small size, and the\r\nmembranous character of the leaves, all point to the Musci as the\r\nClass to which the plant should be referred in spite of the absence of\r\nreproductive organs.\r\n\r\nAmong recent mosses, the genus _Rhizogonium_,—one of the\r\n_Mniaceae_,—and _Polytrichum_ are spoken of as offering a close\r\nresemblance to the fossil form. The type-specimen was found in the\r\nCoal-Measures of Commentry, and is now in the Museum of the École des\r\nMines in Paris; the figure given by MM. Renault and Zeiller faithfully\r\nrepresents the appearance of the plant.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested[475] that some small twigs figured by\r\nLesquereux[476] from the Coal-Measures of North America as _Lycopodites\r\nMeeki_ Lesq., may possibly be mosses. The specimens do not appear\r\nto be at all convincing, and cannot well be included as probable\r\nrepresentatives of Palaeozoic Musci. _Lycopodites Meeki_ Lesq. bears a\r\nclose resemblance to the recent _Selaginella Oregana_ shown in fig. 48,\r\nC.\r\n\r\nFrom Mesozoic rocks we have no absolutely trustworthy fossil mosses.\r\nThe late Prof. Heer[477] has quoted the occurrence of certain fossil\r\nCaterpillars in Liassic beds as indicative of the existence of mosses,\r\nbut evidence of this kind cannot be accepted as scientifically sound.\r\nIn 1850 Buckman[478] described and figured a few fragments of plants\r\nfrom a freshwater limestone at the base of the Lias series near\r\nBristol. Among others he described certain specimens as examples of a\r\nfossil Monocotyledon, under the generic name _Najadita_. Mr Starkie\r\nGardner[479] subsequently examined the specimens, and suggested that\r\nthe Lias fragments referred to _Najadita_ should be compared with the\r\nrecent freshwater moss _Fontinalis_. In this opinion he was supported\r\nby Mr Carruthers and Mr Murray of the British Museum. In a footnote\r\nto the memoir in which this suggestion is made, Gardner refers to a\r\nmoss-capsule from the same beds, which he had received from Mr Brodie.\r\nThrough the kindness of the latter gentleman, I have had an opportunity\r\nof examining the supposed capsule, and have no hesitation in describing\r\nit as absolutely indeterminable. It is in the form of an irregularly\r\noval brown stain on the surface of the rock, with the suggestion of a\r\nstalk at one end, but there are no grounds for describing the specimen\r\nas a moss-capsule, or indeed anything else. The type-specimens figured\r\nby Brodie and subsequently referred to a moss are now in the British\r\nMuseum; they are small and imperfect fragments of slender stems\r\nbearing rather long oval leaves which might well have belonged to a\r\nmoss. The material is however too fragmentary to allow of accurate\r\ndiagnosis or determination.\r\n\r\n2. _Muscites ferrugineus_ (Ludg.). This species possesses a slender\r\nstem bearing crowded ovate-acuminate leaves. The capsules are\r\ncup-shaped, borne on a short stalk, with a circular opening without\r\nmarginal teeth. This fossil was first figured and described by\r\nLudwig[480] from a brown ironstone of Miocene age at Dernbach in\r\nNassau. The author of the species placed it in the recent genus\r\n_Gymnostomum_, and Schimper[481] afterwards changed the generic name to\r\n_Sphagnum_, at the same time altering the specific name to _Ludwigi_.\r\nThe evidence is hardly strong enough to justify a generic designation\r\nwhich implies identity with a particular recent genus, and it is a much\r\nsafer plan to adopt the non-committal term _Muscites_, at the same time\r\nretaining Ludwig’s original specific name. Without having examined\r\nthe type-specimen it is impossible to express a definite opinion as\r\nto the accuracy of the description given by Ludwig; if the capsule is\r\ncorrectly identified it is the oldest example hitherto recorded of a\r\nfossil moss-sporogonium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                  PTERIDOPHYTA (Vascular Cryptogams).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pteridophytes include plants which vary in size from a few\r\nmillimetres[482] to several metres in height. The spore on germination\r\ngives rise to a small thalloid structure, the _prothallium_, on which\r\nthe sexual organs are developed; this is the _gametophyte_ or sexual\r\ngeneration. The sexual organs have the form of typical archegonia\r\nand antheridia. From the fertilised egg-cell there is developed the\r\nPteridophyte plant or _sporophyte_, which bears the spores. This\r\nasexual generation shows a well-marked external differentiation into\r\nstem and leaves, and bears true roots. Internally the tissues exhibit\r\na high degree of differentiation into distinct tissue-systems. True\r\nvascular bundles occur, which may or may not be capable of secondary\r\nthickening by means of a _cambium_, _i.e._ a definitely localised zone\r\nof meristematic tissue. The sporangia are borne either on the ordinary\r\nfoliage leaves or on special spore-bearing leaves called _sporophylls_,\r\nwhich differ in a greater or less degree from the sterile leaves.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the best known and most important Palaeozoic genera\r\nare either true Vascular Cryptogams, or possess certain of the\r\npteridophytic characteristics combined with those of higher plants.\r\nIt is not merely the commoner and more familiar recent genera with\r\nwhich the student of extinct types must be acquainted, but it is\r\nextremely important that he should make himself familiar with the\r\nrarer, less known and more isolated recent forms, which often throw\r\nmost light on the affinities of the older representatives of the group.\r\nIt is often the case, the more isolated living plants are, the more\r\nlikely are they to afford valuable assistance in the interpretation\r\nof genera representing a class, which reached its maximum development\r\nin the earlier periods of the earth’s history. The importance of\r\npaying special attention to such recent plants as may be looked upon\r\nas survivals of a class now tending towards extinction, will be more\r\nthoroughly realised after the extinct vascular cryptogams have been\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the Pteridophyta and Bryophyta brings out certain\r\npoints of divergence. In the first place, the sporophyte assumes in\r\nthe former class a much more prominent rôle, and the gametophyte has\r\nsuffered very considerable reduction. The gametophyte, _i.e._ the\r\nstructure which is formed on the germination of the asexually-produced\r\nspore, is usually short-lived, small, and more or less dependent on\r\nthe sporophyte for its nutrition. In a few cases only is it capable\r\nof providing itself with the essential elements of food. On the\r\nother hand, the sporophyte, at a very early stage of its development\r\nbecomes free from the gametophyte and is entirely self-supporting.\r\nReproduction is effected as in the Bryophyta by sexual reproductive\r\norgans and by asexual methods. Not only have we in the Pteridophytes a\r\nmuch more complete external division of the plant-body into definite\r\nmembers, which subserve distinct functions, and behave as well-defined\r\nphysiological organs adapted for taking a certain share in the\r\nlife-functions of the individual, but the internal differentiation has\r\nreached a much higher stage. True vascular tissue, consisting of xylem\r\nand phloem, occurs for the first time in this class. The whole plant is\r\ntraversed by one or more vascular strands composed of xylem and phloem\r\nelements, which are respectively concerned with the distribution of\r\ninorganic and organic food substances.\r\n\r\nThe Pteridophyta include the most important fossil plants. It is from a\r\nstudy of the internal structure of various extinct representatives of\r\nthis class, that palaeobotanists have been able to contribute facts\r\nof the greatest interest and importance towards the advancement of\r\nbotanical science.\r\n\r\nThe botanist’s chief aim in the anatomical investigation of Palaeozoic\r\ngenera is to discover data which point the way to a solution of the\r\nproblems of plant-evolution. In the abundant material afforded by the\r\npetrified remnants of ancient floras we have the means of tracing the\r\npast history of existing groups or individual forms, and it is from the\r\nPalaeozoic Pteridophytes that our most valuable results have been so\r\nfar obtained.\r\n\r\nIn this and the following chapters of Volume I. two divisions of\r\nthe Pteridophyta are dealt with in such detail as the nature of the\r\nbook allows. In the earlier chapters of Volume II. the remaining\r\nrepresentatives of this class will be described. As in the preceding\r\nchapters such recent plants will be described as are most essential for\r\nthe correct interpretation of the fossil forms.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to do more than confine our attention to a few\r\nonly of the genera of living plants which directly concern us;\r\nsome acquaintance with the general facts of plant morphology must\r\nbe assumed. Among the most useful text-books or books of reference\r\non the Pteridophyta the student may consult those mentioned in the\r\nfootnote[483].\r\n\r\n\r\n                            I. EQUISETALES.\r\n\r\nLeaves usually small in proportion to the size of the whole plant,\r\narranged in whorls at the nodes. Sporangia borne on specially modified\r\nsporophylls or sporangiophores, which are aggregated to form a definite\r\nstrobilus or spore-bearing cone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    EQUISETACEAE. (Recent Species.)\r\n\r\nThe leaves are in whorls, coherent in the form of a sheath, and\r\ntraversed by longitudinal veins which do not fork or anastomose.\r\nThe stem is divided into comparatively long internodes separated by\r\nthe leaf-bearing nodes, and the branches arise in the leaf-axils at\r\nthe nodes. The fertile leaves or sporophylls differ from the sterile\r\nleaves, and usually occur in definite aggregations or strobili\r\ncontaining spores of one kind (_isosporous_). In the single living\r\ngenus _Equisetum_, the outer coat of the mature spore forms two\r\nhygroscopically sensitive filamentous structures or _elaters_. On the\r\ngermination of the spore the gametophyte is developed in the form of\r\na small lobed prothallium 1–2 cm. in length. In most cases there are\r\ndistinct male and female prothallia.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Equisetum_ L., the common Horse-tail, is the sole living\r\nrepresentative of this Family. It occurs as a common native plant\r\nin Britain, and has a wide geographical distribution. Species of\r\n_Equisetum_ are abundant in the temperate zones of both hemispheres,\r\nand occur in arctic as well as tropical latitudes. Wallace[484]\r\nspeaks of Horse-tails, “very like our own species,” growing at a\r\nheight of 5000 feet on the Pangerango mountain in Java. In favourable\r\nsituations the large British Horse-tail, _Equisetum maximum_ Lam. (=\r\n_E. Telmateia_ Erhb.), occasionally reaches a height of about six feet,\r\nand growing in thick clusters forms miniature forests of trees with\r\nslender erect stems and regular circles of long and thin branches. A\r\ntropical species, _Equisetum giganteum_ Linn.[2] living in the marshes\r\nof Mexico and Cuba[485], and extending southward to Buenos Ayres and\r\nChili, reaches a height of twenty to forty feet, but the stem always\r\nremains slender, and does not exceed an inch in diameter. Groves of\r\nsuch tall slender plants on the eastern slopes of the Andes[486]\r\nsuggest to the palaeobotanist an enfeebled forest-growth recalling\r\nthe arborescent Calamites of a Palaeozoic vegetation. The twenty-five\r\nexisting species of _Equisetum_ are remnants of various generic types\r\nof former epochs, and possess a special interest from the point of view\r\nof the geological history of plants. A brief description of the main\r\ncharacters of the recent genus will enable the student to appreciate\r\nthe points of difference and agreement between the extinct and present\r\nrepresentatives of the Equisetales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52. _Equisetum maximum_ Lam. A. Fertile shoot with\r\n  strobilus and sterile leaf-sheaths [after Luerssen (89); slightly\r\n  less than nat. size]. B. Sporophyll bearing open sporangia (after\r\n  Luerssen; slightly enlarged). C. Part of a transverse section\r\n  (diagrammatic); _v_, vallecular canals, _e_, endodermis, _c_,\r\n  carinal canals (after Luerssen; × 20).

From the nodes are given off two sets of buds, which may\r\ndevelope into ascending aerial shoots or descending roots. At each node\r\nis a leaf-sheath more or less deeply divided along the upper margin\r\ninto teeth representing the tips of coherent leaves (fig. 52, A).\r\n\r\nIn some species one or more internodes of underground branches become\r\nconsiderably swollen and assume the form of ovate or elliptical\r\nstarch-storing tubers, which are capable of giving rise to new plants\r\nby vegetative reproduction. Tubers, either singly or in chains, occur\r\nin _E. arvense_ Linn., _E. sylvaticum_ Linn., _E. maximum_ Lam., among\r\nBritish species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53. Rhizome (R) of _Equisetum palustre_ L. with a\r\n  thin shoot giving off roots and tuberous branches from a node\r\n  [after Duval-Jouve (64)].]\r\n\r\nIn the example shown in fig. 53 (_Equisetum palustre_ L.[487]) the\r\nstout rhizome R gives off from its node, marked by a small and\r\nirregular leaf-sheath, two thin roots and a single shoot. The latter\r\nhas a leaf-sheath at its base, and from the second node, with a\r\nlarger leaf-sheath, there have been developed branches with tuberous\r\ninternodes; the constrictions between the tubers and the tips of the\r\nterminal tubers bear small leaf-sheaths. Branched roots are also given\r\noff from the upper node of the erect shoot.\r\n\r\nNear the surface of the ground the buds on the rhizome nodes develope\r\ninto green erect shoots. The shoot axis is marked out into long\r\ninternodes separated by nodes bearing the leaf-sheaths. The surface\r\nof each internode is traversed by regular and more or less prominent\r\nlongitudinal ridges and grooves; each ridge marking the position of\r\nan internal longitudinal vascular strand. In the axil of each leaf,\r\nthat is in the axil of each portion of a leaf-sheath corresponding to\r\na marginal uni-nerved tooth, there is produced a lateral bud which may\r\neither remain dormant or break through the leaf-sheath and emerge as\r\na lateral branch. At the base of each branch an adventitious root may\r\nbe formed from a cell immediately below the first leaf-sheath, but\r\nin aerial shoots the roots usually remain undeveloped. The lateral\r\nbranches repeat on a smaller scale the general features of the main\r\naxis. In some species, the shoots are unbranched, and in others the\r\nslender branches arise in crowded whorls from each node. Leaves, roots\r\nand branches are given off in whorls, and the whorls from each node\r\nalternate with those from the node next above and next below.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANATOMY OF EQUISETUM.]\r\n\r\nIn some species of _Equisetum_ the aerial stem terminates in a\r\nconical group of sporophylls, while in others the strobilus is formed\r\nat the apex of a pale-coloured fertile shoot, which never attains\r\nany considerable length and dies down early in the season of growth\r\n(fig. 52, A). Below the terminal cone or strobilus there occur one\r\nor two modified leaf-sheaths. Such a ring of incompletely developed\r\nleaves intervening between the cone of sporangiophores and the normal\r\nleaves, is known as the _annulus_. The annulus is seen in fig. 52, A,\r\nimmediately below the lowest whorl of sporophylls; it has the form\r\nof a low sheath with a ragged margin. In the region of the cone the\r\ninternodes remain shorter, and the whorls of appendages, known as\r\nsporophylls or sporangiophores, have the form of stalked structures\r\nterminating distally in a hexagonal peltate disc, which bears on its\r\ninner face a ring of five to ten oval sporangia (fig. 52, B). Each\r\nsporangium contains numerous spores which eventually escape by the\r\nlongitudinal dehiscence of the sporangial wall. The opening of the\r\nsporangia is probably assisted by the movements of the characteristic\r\nelaters formed from the outer wall of each spore.\r\n\r\nThe spores, which are capable of living only a short time, grow into\r\naerial green prothallia, 1–2 cm. in length; these have the form\r\nof irregularly and more or less deeply lobed structures. On the\r\nlarger and more deeply lobed prothallia the archegonia or female\r\nreproductive organs are borne, and the smaller or male prothallia bear\r\nthe antheridia. On the fertilisation of an egg-cell, the _Equisetum_\r\nplant is gradually developed. For a short time parasitic on the female\r\nprothallium or gametophyte, the young plant soon takes root in the\r\nground and becomes completely independent.\r\n\r\nAs seen in transverse section through a young stem near the apex, the\r\naxis consists of a mass of parenchyma, in which may be distinguished a\r\ncentral larger-celled tissue, surrounded by a ring of smaller-celled\r\ngroups marking the position of a circle of embryonic vascular strands.\r\nIn each young vascular strand, a few of the cells next the pith may be\r\nseen to have thicker walls and to be provided with a ring-like internal\r\nthickening; these have passed over into the condition of annular\r\ntracheids and represent the _protoxylem_ elements. At a later stage, a\r\ntransverse section through the stem shows a central hollow pith, formed\r\nby the tearing apart and subsequent disappearance of the medullary\r\nparenchymatous cells, which were unable to keep pace with the growth in\r\nthickness of the stem. The pith cavity is bridged across at each node\r\nby a multi-layered plate of parenchyma, which forms the so-called nodal\r\n_diaphragm_. The inner edge of each vascular strand is now found to be\r\noccupied by a small irregularly circular canal (fig. 52, C, c, and D,\r\nc) in which may be seen some of the rings of protoxylem tracheids (D,\r\na) which have been torn apart and almost completely destroyed. These\r\ncanals, known as _carinal canals_, have arisen by the tearing and\r\ndisruption of the thin-walled cells in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nthe protoxylem. Each carinal canal is bounded by a layer of elongated\r\nparenchymatous cells which form part of the xylem of the vascular\r\nbundle, and is succeeded internally by the general ground-tissue\r\nof the stem. The xylem parenchyma next a carinal canal is succeeded\r\nexternally by phloem tissue, consisting of short protoplasmic cells and\r\nlonger elements, without nuclei and poor in contents; the latter may be\r\nregarded as sieve-tubes. On either side of the phloem, the xylem occurs\r\nin two separate bands or groups of annular and reticulately thickened\r\ntracheids. In some species, _e.g._ _Equisetum xylochaetum_ Metten.[488]\r\nand _E. giganteum_[489] L. a native of South America, the xylem has\r\nthe form of two bands composed of fairly numerous tracheids, but in\r\nmost species the xylem tracheids occur in small groups, as shown in\r\nthe figure of _E. maximum_ (fig. 52, D). In the shape of the vascular\r\nbundle, and in the formation of the carinal canal, there is a distinct\r\nresemblance between the vascular bundles of _Equisetum_ and those of\r\na monocotyledonous stem. These collateral stem-bundles of xylem and\r\nphloem traverse each internode as distinct strands, and at the nodes\r\neach strand forks into two branches (fig. 54, A), which anastomose with\r\nthe alternating bundles passing into the stem from the leaf-sheath.\r\nThus the vascular strands of each internode alternate in position with\r\nthose of the next internode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54. A. Plan of the vascular bundles in the stem of\r\n  an _Equisetum_; _b_, branches passing out to buds (after\r\n  Strasburger); _l_, vascular strands passing to the leaf-segments.\r\n  B. Longitudinal section through a node of _E. arvense_ L. (after\r\n  Duval-Jouve; × 20). Explanation in the text.]\r\n\r\nThere are certain points connected with the vascular bundles in the\r\nnodal region of a shoot, which have an important bearing on the\r\nstructure of fossil equisetaceous stems. Fig. 54 B represents a\r\ndiagrammatic longitudinal section through the node of a rhizome of\r\n_Equisetum arvense_ from which a root _h_ is passing off in a downward\r\ndirection, and a branch in an upward direction. The black band _c_\r\nin the parent stem shows the position of the vascular strands; in\r\nthe region of the node the vascular tissue attains a considerable\r\nthickness, as seen at _d_ in the figure. The bands passing out to\r\nthe left from _d_ go to supply the branch and root respectively. The\r\nincreased breadth of the xylem strands at the node is due to the\r\nintercalation of a number of short tracheids. Fig. 55, 4 shows a\r\ntransverse section through a mature node of _Equisetum maximum_; _px_\r\nmarks the position of the protoxylem and _e_ that of the endodermis.\r\nOn comparing this section with that of the internodal vascular bundle\r\nin fig. 52, D, the much greater development of wood in the former is\r\nobvious; the carinal canal of the internodal bundle is absent in the\r\nsection through a node. The disposition of the xylem tracheids in fig.\r\n55, 4 shows a certain regularity which, though not very well marked,\r\nsuggests the development of wood elements as the result of cambial\r\nactivity. Longitudinal sections through the nodal region demonstrate\r\nthe existence of “cells similar to those of an ordinary cambium, and a\r\ncell-formation resulting from their division which is similar to that\r\nin an ordinary secondary thickening.”[490] The short tracheids which\r\nmake up this nodal mass of xylem differ from those in the internodal\r\nbundle in their smaller size, and in being reticulately thickened.\r\nThere is, therefore, evidence that in the nodes of some _Equisetum_\r\nstems additional xylem elements are produced by a method of growth\r\ncomparable with the cambial activity which brings about the growth in\r\nthickness of a forest-tree[491]. The significance of these statements\r\nwill be realised when the structure of the extinct genus _Calamites_ is\r\ndescribed and compared with that of _Equisetum_.\r\n\r\nThe small drawing in fig. 55, 3 shows part of the ring of thick\r\nnodal wood; the section cuts through two bundles about their point\r\nof bifurcation, the strand _x_ is passing out in a radial direction\r\nto a lateral branch, the strand to the right of _x_ and the separate\r\nfragment of a strand to the left of _x_ are portions of leaf-trace\r\nbundles on their way to the leaf-sheath. Reverting to fig. 54, B, the\r\nother structures seen in the section are the leaf-sheaths (_l_ and\r\n_m_), the vallecular canal (_f_), the epidermis, cortex and pith (_k_,\r\n_e_ and _a_) of the stem. The epidermis which has been ruptured by the\r\nroot and branch is indicated at _i_, _i_; the dotted lines traversing\r\nthe upper part of the pith of the lateral branch mark the position of a\r\nnodal diaphragm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55. 1. Transverse section of a root of _Equisetum\r\n  variegatum_ Schl., _e_ endodermis, or outer layer of the\r\n  phloeoterma (after Pfitzer; × 160). 2. Transverse section of\r\n  rhizome of _E. maximum_, slightly enlarged. 3. Transverse section\r\n  through a node of _E. maximum_, _x_, branch of vascular strand\r\n  (slightly enlarged). 4. Transverse section through a node of _E.\r\n  maximum_ showing the mass of xylem, _px_ protoxylem (× 175). (Figs.\r\n  3 and 4 after Cormack.)]\r\n\r\nImmediately external to each vascular strand, as seen in transverse\r\nsection, there is a layer of cells containing starch, and this\r\nis followed by a distinct endodermis, of which the cells show the\r\ncharacteristic black dot in the cuticularised radial walls (fig. 52,\r\nD). Beyond the endodermis there is the large-celled parenchyma of\r\nthe rest of the cortex. Tannin cells occur here and there scattered\r\namong the ground tissue. On the same radius on which each vascular\r\nstrand occurs, the cortical parenchyma passes into a mass of\r\nsub-epidermal thick-walled mechanical tissue or stereome. Alternating\r\nwith the ridges of stereome, the grooves are occupied by thin-walled\r\nchlorophyll-containing tissue which carries on most of the assimilating\r\nfunctions, and communicates with the external atmosphere by means of\r\nstomata arranged in vertical rows down each internode. The continuity\r\nof the cortical tissue is interrupted by the occurrence of large\r\nlongitudinal _vallecular canals_ alternating in position with the stem\r\nridges and vascular strands (fig. 52, C, _v_). The epidermis consists\r\nof a single layer of cells, containing stomata, and with the outer\r\ncell-walls impregnated with silica.\r\n\r\nIn certain species of _Equisetum_, _e.g._ _E. palustre_ L., the whole\r\ncircle of vascular strands is enclosed by an endodermis, and has the\r\nstructure typical of a monostelic stem. In others _e.g._ _E. litorale_\r\nKühl. each vascular strand is surrounded by a separate endodermis,\r\nand in some forms _e.g._ _E. sylvaticum_ L. there is an inner as well\r\nas an outer endodermal layer[492]. Without discussing the explanation\r\ngiven to this variation in the occurrence of the endodermis, it may be\r\nstated that in all species of _Equisetum_ the stem may be regarded as\r\nmonostelic[493].\r\n\r\nIn the rhizome the structure agrees in the main with that of the\r\ngreen shoots, but the vallecular canals attain a larger size, and the\r\npith is solid. A slightly enlarged transverse section of a rhizome\r\nof _Equisetum maximum_ is shown in fig. 55, 2, the small circles\r\nsurrounding the pith mark the position of the vascular bundles and\r\ncarinal canals; the much larger spaces between the central cylinder and\r\nthe surface of the stem are the vallecular canals.\r\n\r\nThe central cylinder or stele of the root is of the diarch, triarch or\r\ntetrarch type; _i.e._ there may be 2, 3 or 4 groups of protoxylem in\r\nthe xylem of the root stele. The axial portion is occupied by large\r\ntracheids, and the smaller tracheids of the xylem occur as radially\r\ndisposed groups, alternating with groups of phloem. External to the\r\nxylem and phloem strands there occur two layers of cells, usually\r\nspoken of as a double endodermis, but it has been suggested that it\r\nis preferable to describe the double layer as the _phloeoterma_[494],\r\nof which the inner layer has the functions of a pericycle, and the\r\nouter that of an endodermis. A transverse section of a root is seen\r\nin fig. 55, 1, the dark cells on the left are part of a thick band of\r\nsclerenchyma in the cortex of the root, the layer e is the outer layer\r\nof the phloeoterma.\r\n\r\nWithout describing in detail the development[495] of the sporangia,\r\nit should be noted that the sporangial wall is at first 3 to 4 cells\r\nthick, but it eventually consists of a single layer. The cells have\r\nspiral thickening bands on the ventral surface, and rings on the\r\ncells where the longitudinal splitting takes place. Each sporangium\r\nis supplied by a vascular bundle which is given off from that of the\r\nsporangiophore axis. The strobili are isosporous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ╭ A.

CALAMITES.\r\n                                ╰ E. ARCHAEOCALAMITES.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the fossil Equisetales, we will first consider\r\nthe genera _Equisetites_, _Phyllotheca_ and _Schizoneura_, and\r\nafterwards describe the older and better known genera _Calamites_\r\nand _Archaeocalamites_. A thoroughly satisfactory classification of\r\nthe members of the Equisetales is practically impossible without\r\nmore data than we at present possess. It has been the custom to\r\ninclude _Equisetites_, _Phyllotheca_ and _Schizoneura_ in the family\r\nEquisetaceae, and to refer _Calamites_ and _Archaeocalamites_ to the\r\nCalamarieae; such a division rests in part on assumption, and cannot\r\nbe considered final. When we attempt to define the Equisetales and the\r\ntwo families Equisetaceae and Calamarieae, we find ourselves seriously\r\nhampered by lack of knowledge of certain important characters, which\r\nshould be taken into account in framing diagnoses. There is little\r\nharm in retaining provisionally the two families already referred to,\r\nif we do not allow a purely arbitrary classification to prejudice our\r\nopinions as to the affinities of the several members of the Equisetales.\r\n\r\nThe Equisetaceae might be defined as a family including plants which\r\nwere usually herbaceous but in some cases arborescent, bearing\r\nverticils of leaves in the form of sheaths more or less deeply divided\r\ninto segments or teeth. The strobili were isosporous and consisted of\r\na central axis bearing verticils of distally expanded sporophylls with\r\nsporangia, as in _Equisetum_. The genus _Equisetites_ might be included\r\nin this family, but it must be admitted that we know next to nothing\r\nas to its anatomy, and we cannot be sure that the strobili were always\r\nisosporous.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Schizoneura_ is too imperfectly known to be defined with any\r\napproach to completeness, or to be assigned to a family defined within\r\ncertain prescribed limits. _Phyllotheca_ is another genus about which\r\nwe possess but little satisfactory knowledge; we are still without\r\nevidence as to its structure, and the descriptions of the few strobili\r\nthat are known are not consistent. Recent work points to a probability\r\nof _Phyllotheca_ being closely allied to _Annularia_, a genus included\r\nin the Calamarieae, and standing for a certain type of Calamitean\r\nfoliage-shoots.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the Calamarieae with the Equisetaceae, the alternation of\r\nsterile and fertile whorls in the strobilus, and the free linear leaves\r\nat the nodes instead of leaf-sheaths are two characters made use of as\r\ndistinguishing features of the genus _Calamites_ as the type of the\r\nCalamarieae. On the other hand, the strobili of _Phyllotheca_ appear to\r\nagree with those of _Calamites_ rather than with those of _Equisetum_,\r\nand strobili of _Archaeocalamites_ have been found exhibiting the\r\ntypical _Equisetum_ characters. The sheath-like form of the leaves\r\nis not necessarily peculiar to the Equisetaceae, and we have evidence\r\nthat leaf-sheaths occurred on the nodes of Calamitean plants. In\r\n_Archaeocalamites_ the leaves possess characteristic features, and can\r\nhardly be said to agree more closely with those of Calamites than with\r\nthe leaves of _Phyllotheca_ or _Sphenophyllum_, a genus belonging to\r\nanother class of Pteridophytes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, without discussing further the possibilities of a\r\nsubdivision of the Equisetales, we may regard the genera _Calamites_,\r\n_Archaeocalamites_, _Equisetites_, _Equisetum_, _Phyllotheca_ and\r\n_Schizoneura_ as so many members of the Equisetales, without insisting\r\non a classification which cannot be supported by satisfactory evidence.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of _Calamites_ is fairly complete. Abundant and\r\nwell-preserved material from the Coal-Measures of England, and from\r\nPermo-Carboniferous rocks of France, Germany and elsewhere, has enabled\r\npalaeobotanists to investigate the anatomical characters of both the\r\nvegetative and reproductive structures of this genus. We are in a\r\nposition to give a detailed diagnosis of Calamitean stems, roots and\r\nstrobili, and to determine the place of this type of plant in a system\r\nof classification. _Calamites_ not only illustrates the possibilities\r\nof palaeobotanical research, but it demonstrates the importance of\r\nfossil forms as foundations on which to construct the most rational\r\nclassification of existing plants. The close alliance between\r\n_Calamites_ and the recent Equisetaceae has been clearly established,\r\nand certain characteristics of the former genus render necessary an\r\nextension and modification of the definition of the class to which\r\nboth _Calamites_ and _Equisetites_ belong. The Calamites broaden our\r\nconception of the Equisetaceous alliance, and by their resemblance\r\nto other extinct Palaeozoic types they furnish us with important\r\nlinks towards a phylogenetic series, which the other members of the\r\nEquisetales do not supply.\r\n\r\nFrom the Upper Devonian to the Permian epoch _Calamites_ and other\r\nclosely related types played a prominent part in the vegetation of\r\nthe world. We have no good evidence for the existence of _Calamites_\r\nin Triassic times; in its place there were gigantic Equisetums which\r\nresembled modern Horse-tails in a remarkable degree. In the succeeding\r\nJurassic period tree-like Equisetums were still in existence, and\r\nspecies of _Equisetites_ are met with in rocks of this age in nearly\r\nall parts of the world. A few widely distributed species are known from\r\nWealden rocks, but as we ascend the geologic series from the Jurassic\r\nstrata, the Equisetums become less numerous and the individual plants\r\ngradually assume proportions practically identical with those of\r\nexisting forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A. _Equisetites._\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Equisetites_ was proposed by Sternberg in\r\n1838[496] as a convenient designation for fossil stems bearing a\r\nclose resemblance to recent species of _Equisetum_. Some authors\r\nhave preferred to apply the name _Equisetum_ to fossil and recent\r\nspecies alike, but in spite of the apparent identity in the external\r\ncharacters of the fossil stems with those of existing Horse-tails, and\r\na close similarity as regards the cones, there are certain reasons\r\nfor retaining Sternberg’s generic name. It is important to avoid such\r\nnomenclature as might appear to express more than the facts admit. If\r\nthe custom of adding the termination -_ites_ to the root of a recent\r\ngeneric term is generally followed, it at once serves to show that the\r\nplants so named are fossil and not recent species. Moreover, in the\r\ncase of fossil Equisetums we know nothing of their internal structure,\r\nand our comparisons are limited to external characters. Stems, cones,\r\ntubers, and leaves are often very well preserved as sandstone casts\r\nwith distinct surface-markings, but we are still in want of petrified\r\nspecimens. There is indeed evidence that some of the Triassic and\r\nJurassic species of _Equisetites_, like the older Calamites, possessed\r\nthe power of secondary growth in thickness, but our deductions are\r\nbased solely on external characters.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages a few of the better known species of\r\n_Equisetites_ are briefly described, the examples being chosen partly\r\nwith a view to illustrate the geological history of the genus, and\r\npartly to contribute something towards a fuller knowledge of particular\r\nspecies. One of the most striking facts to be gleaned from a general\r\nsurvey of the past history of the Equisetaceae is the persistence since\r\nthe latter part of the Palaeozoic period of that type of plant which\r\nis represented by existing Equisetums. There is perhaps no genus in\r\nexistence which illustrates more vividly than _Equisetum_ the survival\r\nof an extremely ancient group, which is represented to-day by numerous\r\nand widely spread species. The Equisetaceous characteristics mark\r\nan isolated division of existing Vascular Cryptogams, and without\r\nreference to extinct types it is practically impossible to do more than\r\nvaguely guess at the genealogical connections of the family. When we go\r\nback to Palaeozoic plants there are indications of guiding lines which\r\npoint the way to connecting branches between the older Equisetales\r\nand other classes of Pteridophytes. The recently discovered genus\r\n_Cheirostrobus_[497] is especially important from this point of view.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEAF-SHEATHS OF EQUISETITES.]\r\n\r\nThe accurate description of species, and the determination of the value\r\nof such differences as are exhibited in the surface characters of\r\nstructureless casts, are practically impossible in many of the fossil\r\nforms. In certain living Horse-tails we find striking differences\r\nbetween fertile and sterile shoots, and between branches of different\r\norders. The isolated occurrence of fragments of fossil stems often\r\nleads to an artificial separation of ‘species’ largely founded on\r\ndifferences in diameter, or on slight variations in the form of the\r\nleaf-sheaths. It is wiser to admit that in many cases we are without\r\nthe means of accurate diagnosis, and that the specific names applied\r\nto fossil Equisetums do not always possess much value as criteria of\r\ntaxonomic differences.\r\n\r\nThe specimens of fossil Equisetums are usually readily recognised by\r\nthe coherent leaf-segments in the form of nodal sheaths resembling\r\nthose of recent species. The tissues of the cortex and central\r\ncylinder are occasionally represented by a thin layer of coal pressed\r\non to the surface of a sandstone cast, or covering a flattened\r\nstem-impression on a piece of shale. It is sometimes possible under\r\nthe microscope to recognise on the carbonised epidermal tissues\r\nthe remains of a surface-ornamentation similar to that in recent\r\nspecies, which is due to the occurrence of siliceous patches on the\r\nsuperficial cells. Longitudinal rows of stomata may also be detected\r\nunder favourable conditions of preservation. The nodal diaphragms\r\nof stems have occasionally been preserved apart, but such circular\r\nand radially-striated bodies may be misleading if found as isolated\r\nobjects. Casts of the wide hollow pith of _Equisetites_, with\r\nlongitudinal ridges and grooves, and fairly deep nodal constrictions,\r\nhave often been mistaken for the medullary casts of _Calamites_.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of _Equisetites_ have been recorded from the Upper\r\nCoal-Measures and overlying Permian rocks, but these present special\r\ndifficulties. In one instance described below, (_Equisetites\r\nHemingwayi_ Kidst.), the species was founded on a cast of what appeared\r\nto be a strobilus made up of sporophylls similar to those in an\r\n_Equisetum_ cone. In other Permo-Carboniferous species the choice of\r\nthe generic name _Equisetites_ has been determined by the occurrence\r\nof leaf-sheaths either isolated or attached to the node of a stem. The\r\nquestion to consider is, how far may the Equisetum-like leaf-sheath\r\nbe regarded as a characteristic feature of _Equisetites_ as distinct\r\nfrom _Calamites_? In the genus _Calamites_ the leaves are generally\r\ndescribed as simple linear leaves arranged in a whorl at the nodes,\r\nbut not coherent in the form of a sheath (fig. 85). The fusion of\r\nthe segments into a continuous sheath or collar is regarded as a\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of _Equisetites_ and _Equisetum_. The\r\ntypical leaf-sheath of a recent Horse-tail has already been described.\r\nIn some species we have fairly large and persistent free teeth on the\r\nupper margin of the leaf-sheath, but in other Equisetums the rim of\r\nthe sheath is practically straight and has a truncated appearance,\r\nthe distal ends of the segments being separated from one another by\r\nvery slight depressions, as in a portion of the sheath of _Equisetum\r\nramosissimum_ Desf. of fig. 58, _C_. In other leaf-sheaths of this\r\nspecies there are delicate and pointed teeth adherent to the margin\r\nof the coherent segments; the teeth are deciduous, and after they have\r\nfallen the sheath presents a truncated appearance. This difference\r\nbetween the sheaths to which the teeth are still attached and those\r\nfrom which they have fallen is illustrated by fig. 58, _B_ and _C_;\r\nit is one which should be borne in mind in the description of fossil\r\nspecies, and has probably been responsible for erroneous specific\r\ndiagnoses. In some recent Horse-tails the sheath is occasionally\r\ndivided in one or two places by a slit reaching to the base of the\r\ncoherent segments[498]; this shows a tendency of the segments towards\r\nthe free manner of occurrence which is usually considered a Calamitean\r\ncharacter. In certain fossils referred to the genus _Annularia_, the\r\nnodes bear whorls of long and narrow leaves which are fused basally\r\ninto a collar (fig. 58, _D_). There are good grounds for believing that\r\nat least some Annularias were the foliage shoots of true Calamites.\r\nAgain, in some species of _Calamitina_, a sub-genus of _Calamites_,\r\nthe leaves appear to have been united basally into a narrow sheath.\r\nWe see, then, that it is a mistake to attach great importance to the\r\nseparate or coherent character of leaf-segments in attempting to draw\r\na line between the true _Calamites_ and _Equisetites_. Potonié[499]\r\nwhile pointing out that this distinction does not possess much value\r\nas a generic character, retains the genus _Equisetites_ for certain\r\nPalaeozoic Equisetum-like leaf-sheaths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56. Calamitean leaf-sheath. From a specimen in the\r\n  Woodwardian Museum. _a_, base of leaf-sheath; (very slightly\r\n  reduced).]\r\n\r\nFig. 56 represents a rather faint impression of a leaf-sheath and\r\nnodal diaphragm. The specimen is from the Coal-Measures of Ardwick,\r\nManchester. The letter _a_ probably points to the attachment of the\r\nsheath to the node of the stem. The flattened sheath is indistinctly\r\ndivided into segments, and at the middle of the free margin there\r\nappears to be a single free tooth. The lower part of the specimen, as\r\nseen in the figure, shows the position of the nodal diaphragm. Between\r\nthe diaphragm and the sheath there are several slight ridges converging\r\ntowards the nodal line; these agree with the characteristic ridges and\r\ngrooves of Calamite casts which are described in detail in Chapter X.\r\nThere is another specimen in the British Museum which illustrates,\r\nrather more clearly than that shown in fig. 56, the association of a\r\nfused leaf-sheath with a type of cast usually regarded as belonging\r\nto a Calamitean stem. Some leaf-sheaths of Permian age described by\r\nZeiller[500] as _Equisetites Vaujolyi_ bear a close resemblance to\r\nthe sheath in fig. 58 E. The nature of the true Calamite leaves is\r\nconsidered more fully on a later page.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PALAEOZOIC EQUISETITES.]\r\n\r\nThe examples of supposed _Equisetites_ sheaths referred to below may\r\nserve to illustrate the kind of evidence on which this genus has\r\nbeen recorded from Upper Palaeozoic rocks. I have retained the name\r\n_Equisetites_ in the description of the species, but it would probably\r\nbe better to speak of such specimens as ‘Calamitean leaf-sheaths’\r\nrather than to describe them as definite species of _Equisetites_.\r\nWe have not as yet any thoroughly satisfactory evidence that the\r\n_Equisetites_ of Triassic and post-Triassic times existed in the\r\nvegetation of earlier periods.\r\n\r\nIn Grand’Eury’s _Flore du Gard_[501] a fossil strobilus is figured\r\nunder the name _Calamostachys tenuissima_ Grand’Eury, which consists of\r\na slender axis bearing series of sporophylls and sporangia apparently\r\nresembling those of an _Equisetum_. There are no sterile appendages or\r\nbracts alternating with the sporophylls; and the absence of the former\r\nsuggests a comparison with _Equisetites_ rather than _Calamites_.\r\nGrand’Eury refers to the fossil as “parfois à peine perceptible,” and a\r\nrecent examination of the specimen leads me to thoroughly endorse this\r\ndescription. It was impossible to recognise the features represented\r\nin Grand’Eury’s drawing. Setting aside this fossil, there are other\r\nstrobili recorded by Renault[502] and referred by him to the genus\r\n_Bornia_ (_Archaeocalamites_), which also exhibit the Equisetum-like\r\ncharacter; the axis bears sporophylls only and no sterile bracts. It\r\nwould appear then that in the Palaeozoic period the Equisetaceous\r\nstrobilus, as we know it in _Equisetum_, was represented in some of the\r\nmembers of the Equisetales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.

From a specimen in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n           1. _Equisetites Hemingwayi_ Kidst. Fig. 57, _A_.\r\n\r\nMr Kidston[503] founded this species on a few specimens of cones\r\nfound in the Middle Coal-Measures of Barnsley in Yorkshire. The best\r\nexample of the cone described by Kidston has a length of 2·5 cm.,\r\nand a breadth of 1·5 cm.; the surface is divided up into several\r\nhexagonal areas 4 mm. high and 5 mm. wide. Each of these plates shows\r\na fairly prominent projecting point in its centre; this is regarded\r\nas the point of attachment of the sporangiophore axis which expanded\r\ndistally into a hexagonal plate bearing sporangia. An examination of\r\nMr Kidston’s specimens enabled me to recognise the close resemblance\r\nwhich he insists on between the fossils and such a recent Equisetaceous\r\nstrobilus as that of _Equisetum limosum_ Sm. Nothing is known of the\r\nstructure of the fossils beyond the character of the superficial\r\npattern of the impressions, and it is impossible to speak with absolute\r\nconfidence as to their nature. The author of the species makes\r\nuse of the generic name _Equisetum_; but in view of our ignorance\r\nof structural features it is better to adopt the more usual term\r\n_Equisetites_.\r\n\r\nSince Kidston’s description was published I noticed a specimen in the\r\nBritish Museum collection which throws some further light on this\r\ndoubtful fossil. Part of this specimen is shown in fig. 57, _A_. The\r\nstem is 21 cm. in length and about 5 mm. broad; it is divided into\r\ndistinct nodes and internodes; the former being a little exaggerated in\r\nthe drawing. The surface is marked by fine and irregular striations,\r\nand in one or two places there occur broken pieces of narrow linear\r\nleaves in the neighbourhood of a node. Portions of four cones occurring\r\nin contact with the stem, appear to be sessile on the nodes, but\r\nthe preservation is not sufficiently good to enable one to speak\r\nwith certainty as to the manner of attachment. Each cone consists of\r\nregular hexagonal depressions, which agree exactly with the surface\r\ncharacters of Kidston’s type-specimen. The manner of occurrence of the\r\ncones points to a lateral and not a terminal attachment. The stem does\r\nnot show any traces of Equisetaceous leaf-sheaths at the nodes, and\r\nsuch fragments of leaves as occur appear to have the form of separate\r\nlinear segments; they are not such as are met with on _Equisetites_.\r\nIt agrees with some of the slender foliage-shoots of Calamitean plants\r\noften described under the generic name _Asterophyllites_. As regards\r\nthe cones; they differ from the known Calamitean strobili in the\r\nabsence of sterile bracts, and appear to consist entirely of distally\r\nexpanded sporophylls as in _Equisetum_. The general impression afforded\r\nby the fossil is that we have not sufficient evidence for definitely\r\nassociating this stem and cones with a true _Equisetites_. We may,\r\nhowever, adhere to this generic title until more satisfactory data are\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n           2. _Equisetites spatulatus_ Zeill. Fig. 58, _A_.\r\n\r\nThis species is chosen as an example of a French _Equisetites_ of\r\nPermian age. It was recently founded by Zeiller[504] on some specimens\r\nof imperfect leaf-sheaths, and defined as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Sheaths spreading, erect, formed of numerous uninerved coherent\r\n  leaves, convex on the dorsal surface, spatulate in form, 5–6 cm.\r\n  in length and 2–3 mm. broad at the base, and 5–10 mm. broad at the\r\n  apex, rounded at the distal end.\r\n\r\nThe specimen shown in fig. 58, _A_, represents part of a flattened\r\nsheath, the narrower crenulated end being the base of the sheath.\r\nThe limits of the coherent segments and the position of the veins\r\nare clearly marked. Zeiller’s description accurately represents the\r\ncharacter of the sheaths. They agree closely with an Equisetaceous\r\nleaf-sheath, but as I have already pointed out, we cannot feel certain\r\nthat sheaths of this kind were not originally attached to a Calamite\r\nstem.\r\n\r\nThe portion of a leaf-sheath and a diaphragm represented in fig. 57,\r\n_B_, agrees closely with Zeiller’s examples. This specimen is from\r\nthe English Coal-Measures, but it is not advisable to attempt any\r\nspecific diagnosis on such fragmentary material. It is questionable,\r\nindeed, if these detached fossil leaf-sheaths should be designated by\r\nspecific names. Another similar form of sheath, hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom Zeiller’s species, has recently been described by Potonié from the\r\nPermian (Rothliegende) of Thuringia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.\r\n\r\n  _A._ _Equisetites spatulatus_, Zeill.

In some specimens the component parts of the sheath are\r\nmore or less separate from one another, and in this form they are\r\napparently identical with the leaves of _Calamites_ (_Calamitina_)\r\n_varians_, Sternb. The example shown in fig. 58, _E_ is probably a\r\nyoung leaf-sheath; the segments are fused, and each is traversed by\r\na single vein represented by a dark line in the figure. The regular\r\ncrenulated lower margin is the base of the sheath, and corresponds to\r\nthe upper portion of fig. 58, _A_. This species affords, therefore, an\r\ninteresting illustration of the difficulty of separating _Equisetites_\r\nleaves from those of true _Calamites_. Potonié has suggested that the\r\nleaf-sheath of a young Calamite might well be split up into distinct\r\nlinear segments as the result of the increase in girth of the stem.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nOther Palaeozoic species of _Equisetites_ have been recorded, but with\r\none exception these need not be dealt with, as they do not add anything\r\nto our knowledge of botanical importance. The specimen described\r\nin the _Flore de Commentry_ as _Equisetites Monyi_, by Renault and\r\nZeiller[506], differs from most of the other Palaeozoic species of\r\n_Equisetites_, in the fact that we have a stem with short internodes\r\nbearing a leaf-sheath at each node divided into comparatively long\r\nand distinct teeth. This species presents a close agreement with\r\nspecimens of _Calamitina_, but Renault and Zeiller consider that it is\r\ngenerically distinct. They suggest that the English species, originally\r\ndescribed and figured by Lindley and Hutton[507] as _Hippurites\r\ngigantea_, and now usually spoken of as _Calamitina_, should be\r\nnamed _Equisetites_. It would probably be better to adopt the name\r\n_Calamitina_ for the French species. The type-specimen of this species\r\nis in the Natural History Museum, Paris.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EQUISETITES PLATYODON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59. _Equisetites platyodon_ Brongn. (After\r\n  Schoenlein, slightly reduced.)]\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from the Permian to the Triassic period, we find large\r\ncasts of very modern-looking Equisetaceous stems which must clearly be\r\nreferred to the genus _Equisetites_. The portion of a stem represented\r\nin fig. 59 known as _Equisetites platyodon_ Brongn.[508] affords an\r\nexample of a Triassic Equisetaceous stem with a clearly preserved\r\nleaf-sheath. The stem measures about 6 cm. in diameter. One of the\r\noldest known Triassic species is _Equisetites Mougeoti_[509] (Brongn.)\r\nfrom the Bunter series of the Vosges.\r\n\r\nThe Keuper species _E. arenaceus_ is, however, more completely known.\r\nThe specimens referred to this species are very striking fossils; they\r\nagree in all external characters with recent Horse-tails but greatly\r\nexceed them in dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   4. _Equisetites arenaceus_ Bronn.\r\n\r\nThis plant has been found in the Triassic rocks of various parts of\r\nGermany and France; it occurs in the Lettenkohl group (Lower Keuper),\r\nas well as in the Middle Keuper of Stuttgart and elsewhere. The species\r\nmay be defined as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Rhizome from 8–14 cm. in diameter, with short internodes,\r\n  bearing lateral ovate tubers. Aerial shoots from 4–12 cm. in\r\n  diameter, bearing whorls of branches, and leaf-sheaths made up\r\n  of 110–120 coherent uni-nerved linear segments terminating in an\r\n  apical lanceolate tooth. Strobili oval, consisting of crowded\r\n  sporangiophores with pentagonal and hexagonal peltate terminations.\r\n\r\nThe casts of branches, rhizomes, tubers, buds and cones enable us to\r\nform a fairly exact estimate of the size and general appearance of\r\nthis largest fossil Horse-tail. The Strassburg Museum contains many\r\ngood examples of this species, and a few specimens may be seen in\r\nthe British Museum. In the École des Mines, Paris, there are some\r\nexceptionally clear impressions of cones of this species from a lignite\r\nmine in the Vosges.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the plant reached a height of 8 to 10 meters,\r\nabout equal to that of the tallest recent species of _Equisetum_,\r\nbut in the diameter of the stems the Triassic plant far exceeded any\r\nexisting species.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to determine as far as possible, in the absence of\r\npetrified specimens, if this Keuper species increased in girth by\r\nmeans of a cambium. There are occasionally found sandstone casts of\r\nthe pith-cavity which present an appearance very similar to that of\r\nCalamitean medullary casts[510]. The nodes are marked by comparatively\r\ndeep constrictions, which probably represent the projecting nodal wood.\r\nThe surface of the casts is traversed by regular ridges and grooves\r\nas in an ordinary Calamite, and it is probable that in _Equisetites\r\narenaceus_, as in _Calamites_, these surface-features are the\r\nimpression of the inner face of a cylinder of secondary wood (_cf._\r\np. 310). Excellent figures of this species of _Equisetites_ are given\r\nby Schimper in his Atlas of fossil plants[511], also by Schimper and\r\nKoechlin-Schlumberger[512], and by Schoenlein and Schenk[513].\r\n\r\n\r\n       5. _Equisetites columnaris_ Brongn. Figs. 11 and 58, _B_.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is by far the best known British _Equisetites_, was\r\nfounded by Brongniart[514] on some specimens from the Lower Oolite beds\r\nof the Yorkshire coast. Casts of stems are familiar to those who have\r\ncollected fossils on the coast between Whitby and Scarborough; they\r\nare often found in an erect position in the sandstone, and are usually\r\ndescribed as occurring in the actual place of growth. As previously\r\npointed out (p. 72), such stems have generally been deposited by water,\r\nand have assumed a vertical position (fig. 11). Young and Bird[515]\r\nfigured a specimen of this species in 1822, and in view of its striking\r\nresemblance to the sugar-cane, they regarded the fossil as being of the\r\nsame family as _Saccharum officinarum_, if not specifically identical.\r\n\r\nA specimen was described by König[516] in 1829, from the Lower\r\nOolite rocks of Brora in the north of Scotland under the name of\r\n_Oncylogonatum carbonarium_, but Brongniart[517] pointed out its\r\nidentity with the English species _Equisetites columnaris_.\r\n\r\nOur acquaintance with this species is practically limited to the\r\ncasts of stems. A typical stem of _E. columnaris_ measures 3 to 6\r\ncm. in diameter and has fairly long internodes. The largest stem in\r\nthe British Museum collection has internodes about 14 cm. long and a\r\ndiameter of about 5 cm. In some cases the stem casts show irregular\r\nlateral projections in the neighbourhood of a node, but there is no\r\nevidence that the aerial shoots of this species gave off verticils of\r\nbranches. In habit _E. columnaris_ probably closely resembled such\r\nrecent species as _Equisetum hiemale_ L., _E. trachyodon_ A. Br. and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe stems often show a distinct swelling at the nodes; this may be due,\r\nat least in part, to the existence of transverse nodal diaphragms which\r\nenabled the dead shoots to resist contraction in the region of the\r\nnodes. The leaf-sheaths consist of numerous long and narrow segments\r\noften truncated distally, as in fig. 58, _B_, and as in the sheath of\r\nsuch a recent Horse-tail as _E. ramosissimum_ shown in fig. 58, _C_. In\r\nsome specimens one occasionally finds indications of delicate acuminate\r\nteeth extending above the limits of a truncated sheath. Brongniart\r\nspeaks of the existence of caducous acuminate teeth in his diagnosis of\r\nthe species, and the example represented in fig. 58, _B_, demonstrates\r\nthe existence of such deciduous appendages. There is a very close\r\nresemblance between the fossil sheath of fig. 58, _B_, with and without\r\nthe teeth, and the leaf-sheath of the recent _Equisetum_ in fig. 58,\r\n_C_. In some specimens of _E. columnaris_ in which the cast is covered\r\nwith a carbonaceous film, each segment in a leaf-sheath is seen to be\r\nslightly depressed in the median portion, which is often distinctly\r\nmarked by numerous small dots, the edges of the segment being flat and\r\nsmooth. The median region is that in which the stomata are found and on\r\nwhich deposits of silica occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n             6. _Equisetites Beani_ (Bunb.). Figs. 60–62.\r\n\r\nBunbury[518] proposed the name _Calamites Beani_ for some fossil stems\r\nfrom the Lower Oolite beds of the Yorkshire coast, which Bean had\r\npreviously referred to in unpublished notes as _C. giganteus_. The\r\nlatter name was not adopted by Bunbury on account of the possible\r\nconfusion between this species and the Palaeozoic species _Calamites\r\ngigas_ Brongn. The generic name _Calamites_ must be replaced by\r\n_Equisetites_ now that we are familiar with more perfect specimens\r\nwhich demonstrate the Equisetean characters of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60. _Equisetites Beani_ (Bunb.). ⅔ nat. size.\r\n  [After Starkie Gardner (86) Pl. IX. fig. 2.]]\r\n\r\nSchimper[519] speaks of this species as possibly the pith-cast of\r\n_Equisetites columnaris_, but his opinion cannot be maintained; the\r\nspecies first described by Bunbury has considerably larger stems than\r\nthose of _E. columnaris_. It is not impossible, however, that _E.\r\ncolumnaris_ and _E. Beani_ may be portions of the same species. The\r\nchief difference between these forms is that of size; but we have not\r\nsufficient data to justify the inclusion of both forms under one name.\r\nZigno[520], in his work on the Oolitic Flora, figures an imperfect stem\r\ncast of _E. Beani_ under the name of _Calamites Beani_, but the species\r\nhas received little attention at the hands of recent writers. In\r\n1886 Starkie Gardner[521] figured a specimen which was identified by\r\nWilliamson as an example of Bunbury’s species; but the latter pointed\r\nout the greater resemblance, as regards the external appearance of the\r\nJurassic stem, to some of the recent arborescent Gramineae[522] than to\r\nthe Equisetaceae. Williamson, with his usual caution, adds that such\r\nappearances have very little taxonomic value. Fig. 60 is reproduced\r\nfrom the block used by Gardner in his memoir on Mesozoic Angiosperms;\r\nhe quotes the specimen as possibly a Monocotyledonous stem. The\r\nfossil is an imperfect cast of a stem showing two clearly marked\r\nnodal regions, but no trace of leaf-sheaths. A recent examination\r\nof specimens in the museums of Whitby, Scarborough, York and London\r\nhas convinced me that the plant named by Bunbury _Calamites Beani_\r\nis a large _Equisetites_. As a rule the specimens do not show any\r\nindications of the leaf-sheaths, but in a few cases the sheaths have\r\nleft fairly distinct impressions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61. _Equisetites Beani_ (Bunb.). From a specimen in\r\n  the British Museum, ⅔ nat. size. (No. V. 2725.)]\r\n\r\nIn the portion of stem shown in fig. 61 the impressions of the leaf\r\nsegments are clearly marked. This specimen affords much better evidence\r\nof the Equisetaceous character of the plant than those which are simply\r\ninternal casts. The narrow projecting lines extending upwards from the\r\nnodes in the figured specimen probably represent the divisions between\r\nthe several segments of each leaf-sheath.\r\n\r\nIn the museums of Whitby and Scarborough there are some long specimens,\r\nin one case 44 cm. in length, and 33 cm. in circumference, which\r\nare probably casts of the broad pith-cavity. These casts are often\r\ntransversely broken across at the nodes, so that they consist of three\r\nor four separate pieces which fit together by clean-cut faces. This\r\nmanner of occurrence is most probably due to the existence of large and\r\nresistant nodal diaphragms which separated the sand-casts of adjacent\r\ninternodes. In the York museum there are some large diaphragms, 10\r\ncm. in diameter, preserved separately in a piece of rock containing\r\na cast of _Equisetites Beani_. The nodal diaphragms of some of the\r\nCarboniferous Calamites were the seat of cork development[523], and\r\nit may be that the frequent preservation of Equisetaceous diaphragms\r\nin Triassic and Jurassic rocks is due to the protection afforded by a\r\ncorky investment.\r\n\r\nThe stem shown in fig. 62 appears to be a portion of a shoot of _E.\r\nBeani_ not far from its apical region. From the lower nodes there\r\nextend clearly marked and regular lines or slight grooves tapering\r\ngradually towards the next higher node; these are no doubt the\r\nimpressions of segments of leaf-sheaths. The sheaths themselves have\r\nbeen detached and only their impressions remain. The flattened bands at\r\nthe node of the stem in fig. 60, and shown also in fig. 61, mark the\r\nplace of attachment of the leaf-sheaths. On some of these nodal bands\r\none is able to recognise small scars which are most likely the casts of\r\noutgoing leaf-trace bundles.\r\n\r\nSome of the internal casts of this species are marked by numerous\r\nclosely arranged longitudinal lines, which are probably the impressions\r\nof the inner face of a central woody cylinder. In the smaller specimen\r\nshown in fig. 62 we have the apical portion of a shoot in which the\r\nuppermost internodes are in an unexpanded condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62. _Equisetites Beani_ (Bunb.). From a specimen in\r\n  the Scarborough Museum. Very slightly reduced.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give a satisfactory diagnosis of this species\r\nwithout better material. The plant is characterised chiefly by the\r\ngreat breadth of the stem, and by the possession of leaf-sheaths\r\nconsisting of numerous long and narrow segments. _Equisetites Beani_\r\nmust have almost equalled in size the Triassic species, _E. arenaceus_,\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\n\r\n     7. _Equisetites lateralis_ Phill. Figs. 58, _F_, 63, and 64.\r\n\r\nThis species is described at some length as affording a useful\r\nillustration of the misleading character of certain features which\r\nare entirely due to methods of preservation. The specific name was\r\nproposed by Phillips in his first edition of the _Geology of the\r\nYorkshire Coast_ for some very imperfect stems from the Lower Oolite\r\nrocks near Whitby[524]. The choice of the term _lateralis_ illustrates\r\na misconception; it was given to the plant in the belief that certain\r\ncharacteristic wheel-like marks on the stems were the scars of\r\nbranches. Lindley and Hutton[525] figured a specimen of this species\r\nin their _Fossil Flora_, and quoted a remark by “Mr Williamson junior”\r\n(afterwards Prof. Williamson) that the so-called scars often occur\r\nas isolated discs in the neighbourhood of the stems. Bunbury[526]\r\ndescribed an example of the same species with narrow spreading leaves\r\nlike those of a Palaeozoic _Asterophyllites_, and proposed this generic\r\nname as more appropriate than _Equisetites_. In all probability\r\nthe example shown in fig. 63 is that which Bunbury described. It\r\nis certainly the same as one figured by Zigno[527] as _Calamites\r\nlateralis_ in his _Flora fossilis formationis Oolithicae_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63. _Equisetites lateralis_ Phill. From a specimen\r\n  in the British Museum. Slightly reduced.]\r\n\r\nThis specimen illustrates a further misconception in the diagnosis of\r\nthe species. The long linear appendages spreading from the nodes are,\r\nI believe, slender branches and not leaves; they have not the form\r\nof delicate filmy markings on the rock face, but are comparatively\r\nthick and almost woody in appearance. The true leaves are distinctly\r\nindicated at the nodes, and exhibit the ordinary features of toothed\r\nsheaths.\r\n\r\nHeer[528] proposed to transfer Phillips’ species to the genus\r\n_Phyllotheca_, and Schimper[529] preferred the generic term\r\n_Schizoneura_. The suggestion for the use of these two names would\r\nprobably not have been made had the presence of the _Equisetum_ sheaths\r\nbeen recognised.\r\n\r\nThe circular depressions a short distance above each node are the\r\n‘branch scars’ of various writers. Schimper suggested that these\r\nradially marked circles might be displaced nodal diaphragms.\r\nAndrae[530] figured the same objects in 1853 but regarded them as\r\nbranch scars, although in the specimen he describes, there are several\r\nof them lying apart from the stems, and to one of them is attached\r\na portion of a leaf-sheath. Solms-Laubach[531] points out that the\r\ninternodal position of these supposed scars is an obvious difficulty;\r\nwe should not expect to find branches arising from an internode. After\r\nreferring to some specimens in the Oxford museum, he adds—“In presence\r\nof these facts the usual explanation of these structures appears to\r\nme, as to Heer, very doubtful.... We are driven to the very arbitrary\r\nassumption that they represent the lowest nodes of the lateral\r\nbranches which were inserted above the line of the nodes of the stem.”\r\nCircular discs similar to those of _E. lateralis_ have been found in\r\nthe Jurassic rocks of Siberia[532] and elsewhere. There are one or\r\ntwo examples of such discs from Siberia in the British Museum. If the\r\nnodal diaphragms were fairly hard and stout, it is easy to conceive\r\nthat they might have been pressed out of their original position when\r\nthe stems were flattened in the process of fossilisation. It is not\r\nquite clear what the radial spoke-like lines of the discs are due to;\r\npossibly they mark the position of bands of more resistant tissue or\r\nof outgoing strands of vascular bundles. A detached diaphragm is seen\r\nin fig. 64 C; in the centre it consists of a flat plate of tissue, and\r\nthe peripheral region is traversed by the radiating lines. In the stem\r\nof fig. 64, A the deeply divided leaf-sheaths are clearly seen, and an\r\nimperfect impression of a diaphragm is preserved on the face of the\r\nmiddle internode. In fig. 64 B a flattened leaf-sheath is shown with\r\nthe free acuminate teeth fused basally into a continuous collar[533].\r\nThe short piece of stem of _Equisetites lateralis_ shown in fig. 58,\r\n_F_, shows how the free teeth may be outspread in a manner which bears\r\nsome resemblance to the leaves of _Phyllotheca_, but a comparison with\r\nthe specimens already described, and a careful examination of this\r\nspecimen itself, demonstrate the generic identity of the species with\r\n_Equisetites_. The carbonaceous film on the surface of such stems as\r\nthose of fig. 58, F, and 64, A, shows a characteristic shagreen texture\r\nwhich may possibly be due to the presence of silica in the epidermis as\r\nin recent Horse-tails.\r\n\r\nThere is another species of _Equisetites_, _E. Münsteri_, Schk., from\r\na lower geological horizon which has been compared with _E. lateralis_,\r\nand lends support to the view that the so-called branch-scars are\r\nnodal diaphragms[534]. This species also affords additional evidence\r\nin favour of retaining the generic name _Equisetites_ for Phillips’\r\nspecies. _Equisetites Münsteri_ is a typical Rhaetic plant; it has been\r\nfound at Beyreuth and Kuhnbach, as well as in Switzerland, Hungary\r\nand elsewhere. A specimen of _Equisetites_ originally described by\r\nBuckman as _E. Brodii_[535], from the Lower Lias of Worcestershire,\r\nmay possibly be identical with _E. Münsteri_. The leaf-sheaths of this\r\nRhaetic species consist of broad segments prolonged into acuminate\r\nteeth; some of the examples figured by Schenk[536] show clearly marked\r\nimpressions of displaced nodal diaphragms exactly as in _E. lateralis_.\r\nAnother form, _Equisetum rotiferum_ described by Tenison-Woods[537]\r\nfrom Australia, is closely allied to, or possibly identical with _E.\r\nlateralis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64. _Equisetites lateralis_ Phill. A. Part of a\r\n  stem showing leaf-sheaths and an imperfect diaphragm. B. A single\r\n  flattened leaf-sheath. C. A detached nodal diaphragm. From a\r\n  specimen in the York Museum. Slightly reduced.]\r\n\r\n\r\n           8. _Equisetites Burchardti_ Dunker[538]. Fig. 65.\r\n\r\nThis species of _Equisetites_ is fairly common in the Wealden beds of\r\nthe Sussex coast near Hastings, and also in Westphalia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65. _Equisetites Burchardti_ Dunk. Showing a node\r\n  with two tubers and a root. From a specimen in the British Museum.\r\n  Nat. size.]\r\n\r\nIt is characterised by having long and slender internodes, bearing at\r\nthe nodes leaf-sheaths with five or six pointed segments, and by the\r\nfrequent formation of branch-tubers. These tuberous branches closely\r\nresemble those which are formed on the underground shoots of _Equisetum\r\narvense_ L., _E. sylvaticum_ L. and others; they occur either singly\r\nor in chains[539]. In the specimen shown in the figure the left-hand\r\ntuber is remarkably well preserved, its surface is somewhat sunk and\r\nshrivelled, and the apex is surrounded by a nodal leaf-sheath. A thin\r\nbranched root is given off just below the point of insertion of the\r\noval tuber.\r\n\r\nNo other species of _Equisetites_ affords such numerous examples\r\nof tubers as this Wealden plant. By some of the earlier writers the\r\ndetached tubers of _E. Burchardti_ were described as fossil seeds under\r\nthe name _Carpolithus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66. _Equisetites Yokoyamae_ Sew. From specimens in\r\n  the British Museum. Nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe specimens shown in fig. 66 have been referred to another species,\r\n_E. Yokoyamae_ Sew.[540]; they were obtained from the Wealden beds\r\nof Sussex, but according to Mr Rufford, who discovered them, the\r\nsmaller tubers of this species are not found in association with\r\nthose of _E. Burchardti_. The stems are very narrow and the tubers\r\nhave a characteristic elliptical form; the species is of little value\r\nbotanically, but it affords another instance of the common occurrence\r\nof these tuberous branches in the Wealden Equisetums.\r\n\r\nSimilar fossil tubers, on a much larger scale, have been found in\r\nassociation with the Triassic _Equisetites arenaceus_; with _E.\r\nParlatori_ Heer[541], a Tertiary species from Switzerland, and with\r\nother Mesozoic and Tertiary stems. _E. Burejensis_[542], described by\r\nHeer from the Jurassic rocks of Siberia, bears a close resemblance to\r\nthe Wealden species.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe description of the above species by no means exhausts the material\r\nwhich is available towards a history of fossil Equisetums. The\r\nexamples which have been selected may serve to illustrate the kind of\r\nspecimens that are usually met with, as well as some of the possible\r\nsources of error which have to be borne in mind in the description of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nSuch Tertiary species as have been recorded need not be considered;\r\nthey furnish us with no facts of particular interest from a\r\nmorphological point of view. The wide distribution of _Equisetites_,\r\nespecially during the Jurassic period, is one of the most interesting\r\nlessons to be learnt from a review of the fossil forms. No doubt a\r\ndetailed comparison of the several species from different parts of the\r\nworld would lead us to reduce the number of specific names; and at the\r\nsame time it would emphasize the apparent identity of fossils which\r\nhave been described from widely separated latitudes under different\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of _Equisetites_ are occasionally found in plant-bearing\r\nbeds apart from the other members of a Flora; this isolated manner of\r\noccurrence suggests that the plant grew in a different station from\r\nthat occupied by Cycads and other elements of the vegetation[543].\r\n\r\nA selection of Triassic and Jurassic species arranged in a tabular form\r\ndemonstrates the world-wide distribution of this persistent type of\r\nplant[544].\r\n\r\n\r\n                           B. _Phyllotheca._\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Phyllotheca_ was proposed by Brongniart[545] in\r\n1828 for some small fossil stems from the Hawkesbury river, near\r\nPort Jackson, Australia. The stems of this genus are divided into\r\nnodes and internodes and possess leaf-sheaths as in _Equisetum_, but\r\n_Phyllotheca_ differs from other Equisetaceous plants in the form of\r\nthe leaves and in the character of its sporophylls. We may define the\r\ngenus as follows:—\r\n\r\nPlants resembling in habit the recent Equisetums. Stems simple or\r\nbranched, divided into distinct nodes and internodes, the latter\r\nmarked by longitudinal ridges and grooves; from the nodes are given\r\noff leaf-sheaths consisting of linear-lanceolate uninerved segments\r\ncoherent basally, but having the form of free narrow teeth for the\r\ngreater part of their length. The long free teeth are usually spread\r\nout in the form of a cup and not adpressed to the stem, the tips of the\r\nteeth are often incurved.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are borne on peltate sporangiophores attached to the stem\r\nbetween whorls of sterile leaves.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of _Phyllotheca_ is unfortunately far from complete. The\r\nchief characteristic of the vegetative shoots consists in the cup-like\r\nleaf-sheaths; these are divided up into several linear segments, which\r\ndiffer from the teeth of an _Equisetum_ leaf-sheath in their greater\r\nlength and in their more open and spreading habit of growth. The large\r\nloose sheaths of the fertile shoots of some recent Horse-tails bear a\r\ncertain resemblance to the sheaths of _Phyllotheca_. The diagnosis of\r\nthe fertile shoots is founded principally on some Permian specimens of\r\nthe genus described by Schmalhausen from Russia[546] and redescribed\r\nmore recently by Solms-Laubach[547]. Prof. Zeiller[548] has, however,\r\nlately received some examples of _Phyllotheca_ from the Coal-Measures\r\nof Asia Minor which bear strobili like those of the genus _Annularia_,\r\na type which is dealt with in the succeeding chapter. A description of\r\na few species will serve to illustrate the features usually associated\r\nwith this generic type, as well as to emphasize the unsatisfactory\r\nstate of our knowledge as to the real significance of such supposed\r\ngeneric characteristics.\r\n\r\nThere are a few fossil stems from Permian rocks of Siberia,\r\nfrom Jurassic strata in Italy, and from Lower Mesozoic and\r\nPermo-Carboniferous beds in South America, South Africa, India and\r\nAustralia which do not conform in all points to the usually accepted\r\ndefinition of _Equisetites_, and so justify their inclusion in an\r\nallied genus. On the other hand there are numerous instances of stems\r\nor branches which have been referred to _Phyllotheca_ on insufficient\r\ngrounds. Our knowledge of this Equisetaceous plant has recently been\r\nextended by Zeiller[549], who has recorded its occurrence in the\r\nCoal-Measures of Asia Minor associated with typical Upper Carboniferous\r\nplants. The same author[550] has also brought forward good evidence for\r\nthe Permian age of the beds in Siberia and Altai, where _Phyllotheca_\r\nhas long been known. It is true that Zigno’s species of the genus\r\noccurs in Italian Jurassic rocks, but on the whole it would seem that\r\nthis genus is rather a Permian than a Jurassic type. The species\r\nwhich Zeiller describes under the name _Phyllotheca Rallii_ from\r\nthe Coal-Measures of Herakleion (Asia Minor) shows some points of\r\ncontact with _Annularia_. It is much to be desired, however, that\r\nwe might learn more as to the reproductive organs of this member of\r\nthe Equisetales; until we possess a closer acquaintance with the\r\nfructification we cannot hope to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion\r\nas to the exact position of the genus among the Calamarian and\r\nEquisetaceous forms. M. Zeiller[551] informs me that his specimens of\r\n_P. Rallii_, which are to be fully described in a forthcoming work,\r\ninclude fossil strobili resembling those of _Annularia radiata_.\r\nThe verticils of linear leaves fused basally into a sheath agree\r\nin appearance with the star-like leaves of _Annularia_, but in\r\n_Phyllotheca Rallii_ the segments appear to spread in all directions\r\nand are not extended in one plane as in the typical _Annularia_[552].\r\n\r\n\r\n                1. _Phyllotheca deliquescens_ (Göpp.).\r\n\r\nIn an account of some fossil plants collected by Tchikatcheff in\r\nAltai, Göppert[553] describes and figures two imperfect stems of an\r\nEquisetum-like plant. Owing to the apparent absence of nodal lines on\r\nthe surface of the stem the generic name _Anarthrocanna_ is proposed\r\nfor the fossils; and the manner in which the main axis appears to break\r\nup into slender branches suggested the specific name _deliquescens_.\r\nSchmalhausen[554] afterwards recognised the generic identity of\r\nGöppert’s fragments with the Indian and Australian stems referred to\r\nthe genus _Phyllotheca_ by McCoy[555] and Bunbury[556].\r\n\r\nWe may define the species as follows:—\r\n\r\nStem reaching a diameter of 2–3 cm. with internodes as much as 4\r\ncm. long, the surface of which is traversed by longitudinal ridges\r\nand grooves which are continuous and not alternate at the nodes.\r\nBranches arise in verticils from the nodes. The leaves have the form\r\nof funnel-shaped sheaths split up into narrow and spreading linear\r\nsegments, each of which is traversed by a median vein. The fertile\r\nshoot terminates in a loose strobilus bearing alternating whorls of\r\nsterile bracts and sporangiophores.\r\n\r\nThe specimens on which this diagnosis is founded are for the most part\r\nfragments of sterile branches. Some of these present the appearance of\r\nCalamitean stems in which the ridges and grooves continue in straight\r\nlines from one internode to the next. Similar stem-casts have been\r\nreferred by some writers to the allied genus _Schizoneura_, and it\r\nwould appear to be a hopeless task to decide with certainty under\r\nwhich generic designation such specimens should be described. The\r\nportion of stem shown in fig. 67 affords an example of an Equisetaceous\r\nplant, probably in the form of a cast of a hollow pith, which might\r\nbe referred to either _Phyllotheca_ or _Schizoneura_. The specimen\r\nwas found in certain South African rocks which are probably of\r\nPermo-Carboniferous age[557]. It agrees closely with some stems from\r\nIndia described by Feistmantel[558] as _Schizoneura gondwanensis_, and\r\nit also resembles equally closely the Australian specimens referred\r\nby Feistmantel[559] to _Phyllotheca australis_ and some stems of\r\n_Phyllotheca indica_ figured by Bunbury[560].\r\n\r\nThe longitudinal ridges and grooves shown in fig. 67 probably represent\r\nthe broad medullary rays and the projecting wedges of secondary wood\r\nsurrounding a large hollow pith, as in _Calamites_. In the Calamitean\r\ncasts the ridges and grooves of each internode usually alternate in\r\nposition with those of the next, as in _Equisetum_ (fig. 54, A), but in\r\n_Phyllotheca_, _Schizoneura_ and _Archaeocalamites_ there is no such\r\nregular alternation at the nodes of the internodal vascular strands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67. _Phyllotheca?_ ¾ nat. size. From a South\r\n  African specimen of Permo-Carboniferous age in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nIn _Phyllotheca_ and _Schizoneura_ there are no casts of ‘infranodal\r\ncanals’ below each nodal line, but these are by no means always found\r\nin true Calamites. It is therefore practically impossible to determine\r\nthe generic position of such fossils as that shown in fig. 67 without\r\nfurther evidence than is afforded by leafless casts.\r\n\r\nA few examples of _Phyllotheca deliquescens_ have been described by\r\nSchmalhausen in which a branch bears clusters of sporangiophores,\r\nalternating with verticils of sterile bracts. The sporangiophores\r\nappear to have the form of stalked peltate appendages bearing\r\nsporangia, very similar to the sporangiophores of _Equisetum_.\r\nSolms-Laubach[561] has examined the best of Schmalhausen’s specimens,\r\nand a carefully drawn figure of one of the fertile branches is given in\r\nhis _Fossil Botany_.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this manner of occurrence of sporangiophores\r\nand whorls of sterile bracts on the fertile branch will be better\r\nunderstood after a description of the strobilus of _Calamites_. In\r\n_Phyllotheca_ the sporangiophores appear to have been given off in\r\nwhorls, which were separated from one another by whorls of sterile\r\nbracts, whereas in _Equisetum_ there are no sterile appendages\r\nassociated with the sporangiophores of the strobilus, with the\r\nexception of the annulus at the base of the cone. Heer[562] first drew\r\nattention to the fact that in _Phyllotheca_ we have a form of strobilus\r\nor fertile shoot to a certain extent intermediate in character between\r\n_Equisetum_ and _Calamites_.\r\n\r\nIn abnormal fertile shoots of _Equisetum_, sporophylls occasionally\r\noccur above and below a sterile leaf-sheath. Potonié[563] has figured\r\nsuch an example in which an apical strobilus is succeeded at a lower\r\nlevel by a sterile leaf-sheath, and this again by a second cluster\r\nof sporophylls. As Potonié points out, this alternation of fertile\r\nand sterile members affords an interesting resemblance between\r\n_Phyllotheca_ and _Equisetum_. It suggests a partial reversion towards\r\nthe Calamitean type of strobilus.\r\n\r\n\r\n            2. _Phyllotheca Brongniarti_ Zigno. Fig. 68, A.\r\n\r\nThis species of _Phyllotheca_ from the Lower Oolite rocks of Italy\r\nis known only in the form of sterile branches. The leaves are fused\r\nbasally into an open cup-like sheath which is dissected into several\r\nspreading and incurved linear segments. The internodes are striated\r\nlongitudinally; they are about 2 mm. in diameter and 10 mm. in length.\r\n\r\nThe specimen represented in fig. 68, A, was originally described by\r\nthe Italian palaeobotanist Zigno[564]; it serves to illustrate the\r\npoints of difference between this genus and the ordinary _Equisetum_.\r\nThe open and spreading sheaths clasping the nodes and the erect\r\nsolitary branches give the plant a distinctive appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.\r\n\r\n  A. _Phyllotheca Brongniarti_, Zigno.

Fig. 68, C.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Bunbury[565] described several imperfect specimens from the\r\nNagpur district of India under this name, but he expressed the opinion\r\nthat it was not clear to him if the plant was specifically distinct\r\nfrom the _Phyllotheca australis_ Brongn. previously recorded from New\r\nSouth Wales. Feistmantel[566] subsequently described a few other Indian\r\nspecimens, but did not materially add to our knowledge of the genus.\r\nBunbury’s specimens were obtained from Bharatwádá in Nagpur, in beds\r\nbelonging to the Damuda series of the Lower Gondwana rocks, usually\r\nregarded as of about the same age as the Permian rocks of Europe.\r\n\r\n_Phyllotheca indica_ is represented by broken and imperfect fragments\r\nof leaf-bearing stems. The species is thus diagnosed by Bunbury:—“Stem\r\nbranched, furrowed; sheaths lax, somewhat bell-shaped, distinctly\r\nstriated; leaves narrow linear, with a strong and distinct midrib,\r\nwidely spreading and often recurved, nearly twice as long as the\r\nsheaths.” An examination of the specimens in the Museum of the\r\nGeological Society of London, on which this account was based, has led\r\nme to the opinion that it is practically impossible to distinguish\r\nthe Indian examples from _P. australis_ described by Brongniart[567]\r\nfrom New South Wales. The few specimens of the latter species which\r\nI have had an opportunity of examining bear out this view. In the\r\nsmaller branches the axis of _P. indica_ is divided into rather short\r\ninternodes on which the ridges and grooves are faintly marked. In\r\nthe larger stems the ridges and grooves are much more prominent, and\r\ncontinuous in direction from one internode to the next; a few branches\r\nare given off from the nodes of some of the specimens. The leaves are\r\nnot very well preserved; they consist of a narrow collar-like basal\r\nsheath divided up into numerous, long and narrow segments, which are\r\nseveral times as long as the breadth of the sheath, and not merely\r\ntwice as long as Bunbury described them. Each leaf-sheath has the form\r\nof a very shallow cup-like rim clasping the stem at a node, with long\r\nfree spreading segments which are often bent back in their distal\r\nregion. The general habit of the leafy branches appears to be identical\r\nwith that of _P. australis_ as figured by McCoy.\r\n\r\nProf. Zeiller informs me that in the type-specimen on which Brongniart\r\nfounded the species, _P. australis_, the sheath appears to be closely\r\napplied to the stem with a verticil of narrow spreading segments\r\nradiating from its margin. It may be, therefore, that in the Australian\r\nform there was not such an open and cup-like sheath as in _P. indica_;\r\nbut it would be difficult, without better material before us, to feel\r\nconfidence in any well marked specific distinctions between the Indian\r\nand Australian Phyllothecas.\r\n\r\nOn the broader stems, such as that of fig. 67, we have clearly marked\r\nnarrow grooves and broader and slightly convex ridges, which present\r\nan appearance identical with that of some Calamitean stems. In the\r\nspecimen figured by Bunbury[568] in his Pl. X, fig. 6, there is a\r\ncircular depression on the line of the node which represents the\r\nimpression of the basal end of a branch; on the edges of the node\r\nthere are indications of two other lateral branches. The nature of\r\nthis stem-cast points umnistakeably to a woody stem like that of\r\n_Calamites_. The precise meaning of the ridges and grooves on the cast\r\nis described in the Chapter dealing with Calamitean plants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CALAMOCLADUS.]\r\n\r\nGrand’Eury[569] in his monograph on the coal-basin of Gard, has\r\nrecently described under the name of _Calamocladus frondosus_ what he\r\nbelieves to be the leaf-bearing axes of a Calamitean plant. The thicker\r\nbranches are almost exactly identical in appearance with the broader\r\nspecimens of _Phyllotheca_. The finer branches of _Calamocladus_\r\nbear cup-like leaf-sheaths which are divided into long and narrow\r\nrecurved segments (fig. 67, B), precisely as in _Phyllotheca_. These\r\ncomparisons lead one to the opinion that the _Phyllotheca_ of Australia\r\nand India may be a close ally of the Permo-Carboniferous Calamitean\r\nplants. The form of the leaf-whorls of _Annularia_ (Calamarian\r\nleaf-bearing branches) and of _Calamocladus_ is of the same type as\r\nin _Phyllotheca_; the character of the medullary casts is also the\r\nsame. The nature of the fertile shoot of _Phyllotheca_ described by\r\nSchmalhausen from Siberia, with its alternating whorls of sterile and\r\nfertile leaves, is another point of agreement between this genus and\r\nCalamitean plants. An Equisetaceous species has been described from\r\nthe Newcastle Coal-Measures of Australia by Etheridge[570] in which\r\nthere are two forms of leaves, some of which closely resemble those of\r\n_Phyllotheca indica_, while others are compared with the sterile bracts\r\nof _Cingularia_, a Calamitean genus instituted by Weiss[571].\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to other recorded forms of _Phyllotheca_ many of\r\nthem appear on examination to have been placed in this genus on\r\nunsatisfactory grounds. Heer figures several stem fragments from the\r\nJurassic rocks of Siberia as _P. Sibirica_ Heer[572], and it was the\r\nresemblance between this form and the English _Equisetites lateralis_\r\nwhich led to the substitution of _Phyllotheca_ for _Equisetites_ in\r\nthe latter species. Without examining Heer’s material it is impossible\r\nto criticise his conclusions with any completeness, but several of\r\nhis specimens, appear to possess leaf-sheaths more like those of\r\n_Equisetum_ than of _Phyllotheca_.\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of isolated diaphragms and the comparatively\r\nlong acuminate teeth of the leaf-sheath afford obvious points of\r\nresemblance to _Equisetites lateralis_. Some of the examples figured\r\nby Heer appear to be stem fragments, with numerous long and narrow\r\nfiliform leaves different in appearance from those of other specimens\r\nwhich he figures. It may be that some of the less distinct pieces\r\nof stems are badly torn specimens in which the internodes have been\r\ndivided into filiform threads. Heer also figures a fertile axis\r\nassociated with the sterile stems, and this does not, as Heer admits,\r\nshow the alternating sterile bracts such as Schmalhausen has described.\r\nSo far as it is possible to judge from an examination of Heer’s figures\r\nand a few specimens from Siberia in the British Museum—and this is by\r\nno means a safe basis on which to found definite opinions—there appears\r\nto be little evidence in favour of separating the fossils described\r\nas _Phyllotheca Sibirica_ from _Equisetites_. This Siberian form may\r\nindeed be specifically identical with _Equisetites lateralis_ Phill.\r\n\r\nVarious species of _Phyllotheca_ have been described from Jurassic and\r\nUpper Palaeozoic rocks in Australia. Some of these possess cup-like\r\nleaf-sheaths, and in the case of the thicker specimens they show\r\ncontinuous ridges and grooves on the internodes, as well as a habit\r\nof branching similar to that in some of the Italian Phyllothecas. In\r\nsome of the stems it is however difficult to recognise any characters\r\nwhich justify the use of the term _Phyllotheca_. A fragment figured by\r\nTenison-Woods[573] as a new species of _Phyllotheca_, _P. carnosa_,\r\nfrom Ipswich, Queensland, affords an example of the worthless material\r\non which species have not infrequently been founded. The author of\r\nthe species describes his single specimen as a “faint impression”;\r\nthe figure accompanying his description suggests a fragment of some\r\nconiferous branch, as Feistmantel has pointed out in his monograph on\r\nAustralian plants.\r\n\r\nIt is important that a thorough comparative examination should be\r\nmade of the various fossil Phyllothecas with a view to determine\r\ntheir scientific value, and to discover how far the separation of\r\n_Phyllotheca_ and _Equisetites_ is legitimate in each case. There is\r\ntoo often a tendency to allow geographical distribution to decide the\r\nadoption of a particular generic name, and this seems to have been\r\nespecially the case as regards several Mesozoic and Palaeozoic Southern\r\nHemisphere plants.\r\n\r\nThe geological and geographical range of _Phyllotheca_ is a question of\r\nconsiderable interest, but as already pointed out it is desirable to\r\ncarefully examine the various records of the genus before attempting\r\nto generalise as to the range of the species. _Phyllotheca_ is often\r\nspoken of as a characteristic member of the _Glossopteris_ Flora of the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere, and its geological age is usually considered to be\r\nMesozoic rather than Palaeozoic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           C. _Schizoneura._\r\n\r\nThe plants included under this genus were originally designated\r\nby Brongniart[574] _Convallarites_ and classed as Monocotyledons.\r\nSome years later Schimper and Mougeot[575] had the opportunity of\r\nexamining more perfect material from the Bunter beds of the Vosges,\r\nand proposed the new name _Schizoneura_ in place of Brongniart’s term,\r\non the grounds that the specimens were in all probability portions of\r\nEquisetaceous stems, and not Monocotyledons. Our knowledge of this\r\ngenus is very limited, but the characteristics are on the whole better\r\ndefined than in the case of _Phyllotheca_. The following diagnosis\r\nillustrates the chief features of _Schizoneura_.\r\n\r\nHollow stems with nodes and internodes as in _Equisetum_; the surface\r\nof the internodes is traversed by regular ridges and grooves, which\r\nare continuous and not alternate in their course from one internode to\r\nthe next. The leaf-sheaths are large and consist of several coherent\r\nsegments; the sheaths are usually split into two or more elongate ovate\r\nlobes, and each lobe contains more than one vein. Fertile shoots are\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nTwo of the best known and most satisfactory species are _Schizoneura\r\ngondwanensis_ Feist. and _S. paradoxa_ Schimp. and Moug.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Schizoneura gondwanensis_ Feist. Fig. 69, A and B.\r\n\r\nThis species is represented by numerous specimens from the Lower\r\nGondwana rocks of India[576]; it is characterised by narrow articulated\r\nstems which bear large leaf-sheaths at the nodes. The sheaths may have\r\nthe form of two large and spreading elongate-oval lobes, each of which\r\nis traversed by several veins (fig. 69, B), or the lobes may be further\r\ndissected into long linear single-veined segments, as in fig. 69, A. It\r\nis supposed that in the young condition each node bears a leaf-sheath\r\nconsisting of laterally coherent segments which, as development\r\nproceeds, split into two or more lobes. Feistmantel records this\r\nspecies from the Talchir, Damuda and Panchet divisions of the Lower\r\nGondwana series of India; these divisions are regarded as equivalent to\r\nthe Permo-Carboniferous and Triassic rocks of Europe. The two specimens\r\nshown in fig. 69 are from the Lower Gondwana rocks of the Raniganj\r\nCoal-field, India.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out[577], some of the specimens of flat and\r\nbroader stems referred by Feistmantel to _Schizoneura_ are identical\r\nin appearance with stems which have been described from India and\r\nelsewhere as species of _Phyllotheca_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69. _Schizoneura gondwanensis_ Feist. (After\r\n  Feistmantel; slightly reduced.)]\r\n\r\nThere are a few specimens of _S. gondwanensis_ in the British Museum,\r\nbut the genus is poorly represented in European collections.\r\n\r\nA similar plant was described in 1844 by Schimper and Mougeot[578]\r\nfrom the Bunter rocks of the Vosges as _Schizoneura paradoxa_. This\r\nspecies bears a very close resemblance to the Indian forms, and indeed\r\nit is difficult to point to any distinction of taxonomic importance.\r\nFeistmantel considers that the European plant has rather fewer\r\nsegments in the leaf-sheaths, and that the Indian plant had somewhat\r\nstronger stems. Both of these differences are such as might easily be\r\nfound on branches of the same species. It is, however, interesting to\r\nnotice the very close resemblance between the Lower Trias European\r\nplant and the somewhat older member of the _Glossopteris_ flora\r\nrecorded from India and other regions, which probably once formed\r\npart of that Southern Hemisphere Continent which is known as Gondwana\r\nLand[579].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                     I. EQUISETALES (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (CALAMARIEAE.)\r\n\r\nIn order to minimise repetition and digression the following account of\r\nthe Calamarieae is divided into sections, under each of which a certain\r\npart of the subject is more particularly dealt with. After a brief\r\nsketch of the history of our knowledge of _Calamites_, and a short\r\ndescription of the characteristics of the genus, the morphological\r\nfeatures are more fully considered. A description of the most striking\r\nfeatures of the better known Calamitean types is followed by a short\r\ndiscussion on the question of nomenclature and classification, and\r\nreference is made to the manner of occurrence of _Calamites_ and to\r\nsome of the possible sources of error in identification.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             D. CALAMITES.\r\n\r\n                         I. Historical Sketch.\r\n\r\nIn the following account of the Calamarieae the generic name\r\n_Calamites_ is used in a somewhat comprehensive sense. As previous\r\nwriters have pointed out, it is probable that under this generic name\r\nthere may be included more than one type of plant worthy of generic\r\ndesignation. Owing to the various opinions which have been held by\r\ndifferent authors, as to the relationship and botanical position of\r\nplants now generally included in the Calamarieae, there has been no\r\nlittle confusion in nomenclature. Facts as to the nature of the genus\r\n_Calamites_ have occasionally to be selected from writings containing\r\nmany speculative and erroneous views, but the data at our disposal\r\nenable us to give a fairly complete account of the morphology of this\r\nPalaeozoic plant.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest works on fossil plants we find several figures of\r\n_Calamites_, which are in most cases described as those of fossil\r\nreeds or grasses. The _Herbarium diluvianum_ of Scheuchzer[580]\r\ncontains a figure of a Calamitean cast which is described as probably\r\na reed. Another specimen is figured by Volkmann[581] in his _Silesia\r\nsubterranea_ and compared with a piece of sugar-cane. A similar\r\nflattened cast in the old Woodwardian collection at Cambridge is\r\ndescribed by Woodward[582] as “part of a broad long flat leaf,\r\nappearing to be of some _Iris_, or rather an Aloe, but ’tis striated\r\nwithout.” Schulze[583], one of the earlier German writers, figured a\r\nCalamitean branch bearing verticils of leaves, and described the fossil\r\nas probably the impression of an Equisetaceous plant. It has been\r\npointed out by another German writer that the Equisetaceous character\r\nof _Calamites_ was recognised by laymen many years before specialists\r\nshared this view.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and important of all the older records of\r\n_Calamites_ is that published by Suckow[584] in 1784. Suckow is usually\r\nquoted as the author of the generic name _Calamites_; he does not\r\nattempt any diagnosis of the plant, but merely speaks of the specimens\r\nhe is describing as “Calamiten.” The examples figured in this classic\r\npaper are characteristic casts from the Coal-Measures of Western\r\nGermany. Suckow describes them as ribbed stems, which were found in\r\nan oblique position in the strata and termed by the workmen Jupiter’s\r\nnails (“Nägel”). Previous writers had regarded the fossils as casts\r\nof reeds, but Suckow correctly points out that the ribbed character\r\nis hardly consistent with the view that the casts are those of reeds\r\nor grasses. He goes on to say that the material filling up the hollow\r\npith of a reed would not have impressed upon it a number of ribs and\r\ngrooves such as occur on the Calamites. He considers it more probable\r\nthat the casts are those of some well-developed tree, probably a\r\nforeign plant. _Equisetum giganteum_ L. is mentioned as a species with\r\nwhich _Calamites_ may be compared, although the stem of the Palaeozoic\r\ngenus was much larger than that of the recent Horse-tail. The tree\r\nof which the Calamites are the casts must, he adds, have possessed\r\na ribbed stem, and the bark must also have been marked by vertical\r\nribs and grooves on its _inner face_. It is clear, therefore, that\r\nSuckow inclined to the view that _Calamites_ should be regarded as an\r\n_internal cast_ of a woody plant. Such an interpretation of the fossils\r\nwas generally accepted by palaeobotanists only a comparatively few\r\nyears ago, and the first suggestion of this view is usually attributed\r\nto Germar, Dawes, and other authors who wrote more than fifty years\r\nlater than Suckow.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest notices of _Calamites_ in the present century is\r\nby Steinhauer[585], who published a memoir in the Transactions of the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society in 1818 on _Fossil reliquia of unknown\r\nvegetables in the Carboniferous rocks_. He gives some good figures of\r\nCalamitean casts under the generic name of _Phytolithus_, one of those\r\ngeneral terms often used by the older writers on fossils. Among English\r\nauthors, Martin[586] may be mentioned as figuring casts of _Calamites_,\r\nwhich he describes as probably grass stems. By far the best of\r\nthe earlier figures are those by Artis[587] in his _Antediluvian\r\nPhytology_. This writer does not discuss the botanical nature of the\r\nspecimens beyond a brief reference to the views of earlier authors.\r\nAdolphe Brongniart[588], writing in 1822, expresses the opinion that\r\nthe Calamites are related to the genus _Equisetum_, and refers to\r\nM. de Candolle as having first suggested this view. In a later work\r\nBrongniart[589] includes species of _Calamites_ as figured by Suckow,\r\nSchlotheim, Sternberg and Artis in the family _Equisetaceae_. Lindley\r\nand Hutton[590] give several figures of Calamites in their _Fossil\r\nflora_, but do not commit themselves to an Equisetaceous affinity.\r\n\r\nAn important advance was made in 1835 by Cotta[591], a German writer,\r\nwho gave a short account of the internal structure of some Calamite\r\nstems, which he referred to a new genus _Calamitea_. The British Museum\r\ncollection includes some silicified fragments of the stems figured\r\nand described by Cotta in his _Dendrolithen_. Some of the specimens\r\ndescribed by this author as examples of _Calamitea_ have since been\r\nrecognised as members of another family.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PETZHOLDT AND UNGER.]\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Unger[592] published a note on the structure and affinities of\r\n_Calamites_, and expressed his belief in the close relationship of the\r\nPalaeozoic plant and recent Horse-tails.\r\n\r\nAn important contribution to our knowledge of _Calamites_ was supplied\r\nby Petzholdt[593] in 1841. His main contention was the Equisetaceous\r\ncharacter of this Palaeozoic genus. The external resemblance between\r\nCalamite casts and _Equisetum_ stems had long been recognised, but\r\nafter Cotta’s account of the internal structure it was believed that\r\nthe apparent relation between _Equisetum_ and _Calamites_ was not\r\nconfirmed by the facts of anatomy. Petzholdt based his conclusions\r\non certain partially preserved Permian stems from Plauenscher Grund,\r\nnear Dresden. Although his account of the fossils is not accurate his\r\ngeneral conclusions are correct. The specimens described by Petzholdt\r\ndiffer from the common Calamite casts in having some carbonised\r\nremnants of cortical and woody tissue. A transverse section of one of\r\nthe Plauenscher Grund fossils is shown in fig. 70. The irregular black\r\npatches were described by Petzholdt as portions of cortical tissue,\r\nwhile he regarded the spaces as marking the position of canals like the\r\nvallecular canals in an _Equisetum_. Our more complete knowledge of the\r\nstructure of a Calamite stem enables us to correlate the patches in\r\nwhich no tissue has been preserved with the broad medullary rays, which\r\nseparated the wedge-shaped groups of xylem elements; the latter being\r\nmore resistant were converted into a black coaly substance, while the\r\ncells of the medullary rays left little or no trace in the sandstone\r\nmatrix. The thin black line, which forms the limit of the drawing in\r\nfig. 70, external to the carbonised wood, no doubt marks the limit\r\nof the cortex, and the appendage indicated in the lower part of the\r\nfigure may possibly be an adventitious root. It is interesting to note\r\nthat Unger[594] in 1844 expressed the opinion, which we now know to be\r\ncorrect, that the coaly mass in the specimens described by Petzholdt\r\nrepresented the wood, and that there was no proof of the existence of\r\ncanals in the cortex as Petzholdt believed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70. Transverse section of a Calamite stem, showing\r\n  carbonised remnants of secondary wood. From a specimen (no. 40934),\r\n  presented to the British Museum by Dr Petzholdt from Plauenscher\r\n  Grund, Dresden. ½ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nTurning to Brongniart’s later work[595] we find an important\r\nproposal which led to no little controversy. While retaining the\r\ngenus _Calamites_ for such specimens as possess a thin bark and a\r\nribbed external surface, showing occasional branch-scars at the\r\nnodes, and having such characters as warrant their inclusion in the\r\nEquisetaceae, he proposes a second generic name for other specimens\r\nwhich had hitherto been included in _Calamites_. The fossils assigned\r\nto his new genus _Calamodendron_ are described as having a thick woody\r\nstem, and as differing from _Equisetum_ in their arborescent nature.\r\nBrongniart’s genus _Calamodendron_ is made to include the plants for\r\nwhich Cotta instituted the name _Calamitea_, and it is placed among\r\nthe Gymnosperms. This distinction between the Vascular Cryptogam\r\n_Calamites_ and the supposed Gymnosperm _Calamodendron_ is based on the\r\npresence of secondary wood in the latter type of stem. The prominence\r\nformerly assigned to the power of secondary thickening possessed by a\r\nplant as a taxonomic feature, is now known to have been the result of\r\nimperfect knowledge. The occurrence of a cambium layer and the ability\r\nof a plant to increase in girth by the activity of a definite meristem,\r\nis a feature which some recent Vascular Cryptogams[596] share with the\r\nhigher plants; and in former ages many of the Pteridophytes possessed\r\nthis method of growth in a striking degree.\r\n\r\nAlthough Brongniart’s distinction between _Calamites_ and\r\n_Calamodendron_ has not been borne out by subsequent researches, the\r\nlatter term is still used as a convenient designation for a special\r\ntype of Calamitean structure. One of the earliest accounts of the\r\nanatomy of _Calamodendron_ stems is by Mougeot[597], who published\r\nfigures and descriptions of two species, _Calamodendron striatum_ and\r\n_C. bistriatum_.\r\n\r\nSome years later Göppert[598], who was one of the greatest of the\r\nolder palaeobotanists, instituted another genus, _Arthropitys_[599],\r\nfor certain specimens of silicified stems from the Permian rocks of\r\nChemnitz in Saxony, which Cotta had previously placed in his genus\r\n_Calamitea_ under the name of _Calamitea bistriata_[600]. Göppert\r\nrightly decided that the plants so named by Cotta differed in important\r\nhistological characters from other species of _Calamitea_. The generic\r\nname _Arthropitys_ has been widely adopted for a type of Calamitean\r\nstem characterised by definite structural features. The great majority\r\nof the petrified Calamite stems found in the English Coal-Measures\r\nbelong to Göppert’s _Arthropitys_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILLIAMSON.]\r\n\r\nThe next proposal to be noticed is one by Williamson[601] in 1868;\r\nhe instituted the generic name _Calamopitys_ for a few examples\r\nof English stems, which differed in the structure of the wood and\r\nprimary medullary rays from previously recorded types. We have thus\r\nfour names which all stand for generic types of Calamitean stems. Of\r\nthese _Calamodendron_ and _Arthropitys_ are still used as convenient\r\ndesignations for stems with well-defined anatomical characters.\r\nThe genus _Calamitea_ is no longer in use, and Williamson’s name\r\n_Calamopitys_ had previously been made use of by Unger[602] for plants\r\nwhich do not belong to the Calamarieae. As it is convenient to have\r\nsome term to apply to such stems as those which Williamson made the\r\ntype of _Calamopitys_, the name _Arthrodendron_ is suggested by my\r\nfriend Dr Scott[603] as a substitute for Williamson’s genus.\r\n\r\nThe twofold division of the Calamites instituted by Brongniart has\r\nalready been alluded to, and for many years it was generally agreed\r\nthat both Pteridophytes and Gymnosperms were represented among the\r\nPalaeozoic fossils known as Calamites. The work of Prof. Williamson\r\nwas largely instrumental in proving the unsound basis for this\r\nartificial separation; he insisted on the inclusion of all Calamites\r\nin the Vascular Cryptogams, irrespective of the presence or absence\r\nof secondary wood. By degrees the adherents of Brongniart’s views\r\nacknowledged the force of the English botanist’s contention. It is\r\none of the many signs of the value of Williamson’s work that there is\r\nnow almost complete accord among palaeobotanical writers as to the\r\naffinities of Calamitean plants.\r\n\r\nIn the following account of the Calamites, the generic name\r\n_Calamites_ is used in a wide sense as including stems possessing\r\ndifferent types of internal structure; when it is possible to recognise\r\nany of these structural types the terms _Calamodendron_, _Arthropitys_\r\nor _Arthrodendron_ are used as subgenera. The reasons for this\r\nnomenclature are discussed in a later part of the Chapter.\r\n\r\n                                  ╭ This term was originally applied\r\n  Genus _Calamites_, Suckow, 1714 ┤ to the common pith-casts of\r\n                                  │ Calamitean stems, _without reference\r\n                                  ╰ to_ _internal structure_.\r\n\r\n  Subgenera _Calamodendron_,  Brongniart, 1849  ╮ These  names have\r\n            _Arthropitys_     Göppert,    1864  ├ primarily reference\r\n            _Arthrodendron_   Scott       1897  │ to _internal_\r\n             (= _Calamopitys_ Williamson, 1871) ╯ _structure_.\r\n\r\n\r\n             II. Description of the anatomy of Calamites.\r\n\r\n              _a. Stems. b. Leaves. c. Roots. d. Cones._\r\n\r\nNo fossils are better known to collectors of Coal-Measure plants than\r\nthe casts and impressions of the numerous species of _Calamites_. In\r\nsandstone quarries of Upper Carboniferous rocks there are frequently\r\nfound cylindrical or somewhat flattened fossils, varying from one to\r\nseveral inches in diameter, marked on the surface by longitudinal\r\nridges and grooves, and at more or less regular intervals by regular\r\ntransverse constrictions. Similar specimens are still more abundant\r\nas flattened casts in the blocks of shale found on the rubbish heaps\r\nof collieries. The sandstone casts are often separated from the\r\nsurrounding rock by a loose brown or black crumbling material, and the\r\nspecimens in the shale are frequently covered by a thin layer of coal.\r\n\r\nMost of the earlier writers regarded such specimens as the impressions\r\nof the ribbed stems of plants similar to or identical with reeds or\r\ngrasses. Suckow, and afterwards Dawes and others, expressed the opinion\r\nthat the ordinary Calamite cast represented a hardened mass of sand\r\nor marl, which had filled up the pith of a stem either originally\r\nfistular or rendered hollow by decay. The investigation of the internal\r\nstructure confirmed this view, and proved that the surface-features of\r\na Calamite stem do not represent the external markings of the original\r\nplant, but the form of the inner face of the cylinder of wood. The ribs\r\nrepresent the medullary rays of the original stem or branch, and the\r\nintervening grooves mark the position of the strands of xylem which are\r\narranged in a ring round a large hollow pith[604].\r\n\r\nWith this brief preliminary account we may pass to a detailed\r\ndescription of the anatomical characters of _Calamites_.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Calamites_ may be briefly defined as follows:—\r\n\r\nArborescent plants reaching a height of several meters, and having a\r\ndiameter of proportional size. In habit of growth the Calamites bore\r\na close resemblance to _Equisetum_; an underground rhizome giving off\r\nlateral branches and erect aerial shoots bearing branches, either in\r\nwhorls from regularly recurring branch-bearing nodes, or two or three\r\nfrom each node; and in some cases the stems bore occasional branches\r\nfrom widely separated nodes. The leaves were disposed in whorls either\r\nas star-shaped verticils on slender foliage shoots, or in the form\r\nof a circle of long narrow leaves on the node of a thicker branch.\r\nAdventitious roots were developed from the nodal regions of underground\r\nand aerial stems. The cones had the form of long and narrow strobili\r\nconsisting of a central axis bearing whorls of sterile and fertile\r\nappendages; the latter in the form of sporangiophores bearing groups of\r\nsporangia. The strobili were heterosporous in some cases, isosporous\r\nin others. The stems had a large hollow pith bridged across by a\r\ntransverse diaphragm at the nodes in the centre of the single stele;\r\nthe latter consisted of a ring of collateral bundles separated from one\r\nanother by primary medullary rays. Each group of xylem was composed of\r\nspiral, annular, scalariform and occasionally reticulate tracheids,\r\nthe position of the protoxylem being marked by a longitudinal\r\ncarinal canal. The shoots and roots grew in thickness by means of a\r\nregular cambium layer. The cortex consisted of parenchymatous and\r\nsclerenchymatous cells, with scattered secretory sacs. The increase in\r\ngirth of the central cylinder was often accompanied by a considerable\r\ndevelopment of cortical periderm. The roots differed from the shoots\r\nin having no carinal canals, and in the possession of a solid pith and\r\ncentripetally developed primary xylem groups alternating with strands\r\nof phloem.\r\n\r\nThe above incomplete diagnosis includes only some of the more important\r\nstructural features of the genus. Thanks to the researches begun by the\r\nlate Mr Binney of Manchester and considerably extended by Carruthers,\r\nWilliamson and later investigators, we are now in a position to give\r\na fairly complete account of _Calamites_. The type of stem most\r\nfrequently met with in a petrified condition in the English rocks is\r\nthat to which Göppert applied the name _Arthropitys_, and it is this\r\nsubgenus that forms the subject of the following description. Our\r\nknowledge of Calamitean anatomy is based on the examination of numerous\r\nfragments of petrified twigs and other portions of different specific\r\ntypes of the genus. It is seldom possible to differentiate specifically\r\nbetween the isolated fragments of stems and branches which are met\r\nwith in calcareous or siliceous nodules. As so frequently happens in\r\nfossil-plant material, large specimens showing good surface features\r\nand broken fragments with well-preserved internal structure have to be\r\ndealt with separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: YOUNG STEM.]\r\n\r\n                              _a. Stems._\r\n\r\nA transverse section of a young twig, such as is represented in fig.\r\n71, illustrates the chief characteristics of the _primary structure_\r\nof a young branch of _Calamites_. The figure has been drawn from\r\na section originally described by Hick[605] in 1894. A very young\r\nCalamite twig bears an exceedingly close resemblance to the stem of\r\na recent _Equisetum_. The axial region of the stem may be occupied\r\nby parenchymatous cells, or the absence of cells in the centre may\r\nindicate the beginning of the gradual formation of the hollow pith,\r\nwhich is one of the characteristics of _Calamites_. The student of\r\npetrified Palaeozoic plants must constantly be on his guard against\r\nthe possible misinterpretation of Stigmarian ‘rootlets,’ which are\r\nfrequently found in intimate association with fossil tissues. The\r\nintrusion of these rootlets is admirably illustrated by a section\r\nof a Calamite stem in the Williamson Collection (No. 1558) in which\r\nthe hollow pith, 2 cm. broad, contains more than a dozen Stigmarian\r\nappendages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71. Transverse section of a young Calamite stem.\r\n  _c_, carinal canals; _mr_, primary medullary rays; _a, b, and d_,\r\n  cortex; _e_, epidermis. From a section in the Manchester Museum,\r\n  Owens College, × 60.]\r\n\r\nIn the figured specimen of a Calamite twig (fig. 71) there is a clearly\r\nmarked differentiation into a cortical region and a large stele or\r\ncentral cylinder. The pith-cells are already partially disorganised,\r\nbut there still remain a few fairly large parenchymatous cells internal\r\nto the ring of vascular bundles. The few irregular projections into the\r\ncavity of the large pith consist of small fragments of cells, which may\r\nbe the result of fungal action. Mycelia of fungi are occasionally met\r\nwith in the tissues of older Calamite stems.\r\n\r\nThe position of the primary xylem groups is shown by the conspicuous\r\nand regularly placed canals, _c_; these have been formed in precisely\r\nthe same manner as the corresponding spaces in an _Equisetum_ stem,\r\nand they are spoken of in both genera as the carinal canals. Each\r\ncanal owes its origin to the disorganization and tearing apart of\r\nthe protoxylem elements and the surrounding cells. This may be\r\noccasionally seen in examples of very young Calamites; the canals of\r\na young twig often contain apparently isolated rings which are coils\r\nof elongated spiral threads. Fig. 72, _B_ represents the canal of a\r\ntwig, cut in an oblique direction, in which the remains of spiral\r\ntracheids are distinctly seen. In the stem of fig. 71 the development\r\nhas not advanced far enough to enable us to clearly define the exact\r\nlimits of each xylem strand. The smaller elements bordering the canals\r\nconstitute the primary xylem, they are fairly distinct on the outer\r\nmargin of some of the canals seen in the section. Between the small\r\npatches of primary xylem the outward extensions of the parenchyma of\r\nthe pith constitute the primary medullary rays, _mr_. The distinct line\r\nencircling the canals and primary xylem has been described by Hick as\r\nmarking the position of the endodermis, but it may possibly owe its\r\nexistence to the tearing of the tissues along the line where cambial\r\nactivity is just beginning. This layer of delicate dividing cells\r\nwould constitute a natural line of weakness. External to this line\r\nwe have a zone of tissue _a_, _d_, containing here and there larger\r\ncells with black contents, which are no doubt secretory sacs. It is\r\nimpossible to distinguish with certainty any definite phloem groups,\r\nbut in other specimens these have been recognised immediately external\r\nto each primary xylem group; the bundles were typically collateral in\r\nstructure. Towards the periphery of the twig the preservation is much\r\nless perfect; the outer portion of the inner cortex, _d_, consists\r\nof rather smaller and thicker-walled cells, but this is succeeded\r\nby an ill-defined zone containing a few scattered cells, _b_, which\r\nhave been more perfectly preserved. The twig is too young to show any\r\nsecondary tissue in the cortex; but the tangential walls in some of\r\nthe cortical cells afford evidence of meristematic activity, which\r\nprobably represents the beginning of cork-formation. The limiting line,\r\n_e_, possibly represents the cuticularised outer walls of an epidermal\r\nlayer. The irregularly wavy character of the surface of the specimen\r\nis probably the result of shrinking, and does not indicate original\r\nsurface features.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VASCULAR SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nIn examining sections of calcareous nodules from the coal seams one\r\nmeets with numerous fragments of small Calamitean twigs with little\r\nor no secondary wood; in some of these there is a small number of\r\ncarinal canals, in others the canals are much more abundant. The\r\nformer probably represent the smaller ramifications of a plant, and\r\nthe latter may be regarded as the young stages of branches capable of\r\ndeveloping into stout woody shoots[606]. Longitudinal sections of small\r\nbranches teach us that the xylem elements next the carinal canals are\r\neither spiral or reticulate in character, the older tracheids being\r\nfor the most part of the scalariform type, with bordered pits on the\r\nradial walls. This and other histological characters are admirably\r\nshown in the illustrations accompanying Williamson and Scott’s memoir\r\non _Calamites_. The student should treat the account of the anatomy\r\nof _Calamites_ given in these pages as introductory to the much more\r\ncomplete description by these authors. They thus describe the course of\r\nthe vascular bundles in a Calamitean branch:—\r\n\r\n“The bundle-system of _Calamites_ bears a general resemblance to that\r\nof _Equisetum_. A single leaf-trace enters the stem from each leaf,\r\nand passes vertically downwards to the next node. In the simplest\r\ncases the bundle here forks, its two branches attaching themselves to\r\nthe alternating bundles which enter the stem at this node. In other\r\ncases both the forks attach themselves to the same bundle, so that,\r\nin this case, there is no regular alternation. In other cases, again,\r\nthe bundle runs past one node without forking, and ultimately forms a\r\njunction with the traces of the second node below its starting-point.\r\nThese variations may all occur in the same specimen. The xylem at the\r\nnode usually forms a continuous ring, for where the regular dichotomous\r\nforks of the bundles are absent their place is usually taken by\r\nanastomoses[607].”\r\n\r\nAs in _Equisetum_, the xylem at the nodes possesses certain\r\ncharacteristic features which distinguish it from the internodal\r\nstrands. It has already been pointed out that the xylem of _Equisetum_\r\nincreases in breadth at the nodes (p. 251, fig. 55, 4); the same is\r\ntrue of _Calamites_. In fig. 72, _C_, we have part of a radial section\r\nof a Calamite twig in which the broad mass of short nodal tracheids is\r\nclearly shown; this nodal wood forms a prominent projection towards\r\nthe pith. In the lower part of the section the remains of some spiral\r\nprotoxylem tracheids are seen in a carinal canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.\r\n\r\n  _A._ External xylem elements and cambium, _c_, with imperfect phloem,\r\n      × 100.\r\n  _B._ Carinal canal containing protoxylem, _px._ × 65.\r\n  _C._ Radial longitudinal section through nodal xylem, _px._ × 35.\r\n  _D._ Phloem elements; _s_, sieve-tubes; _p_, _p_, parenchymatous\r\n      cells.\r\n  (_A–C._ After Williamson and Scott. _D._ After Renault.)]\r\n\r\nThe tracheids of the nodal wood are often reticularly pitted, and so\r\ndiffer in appearance from the ordinary scalariform elements.\r\n\r\nIt is rare to find the phloem clearly preserved, but in specimens where\r\nit has been possible to examine this portion of the vascular bundles,\r\nit is found to consist of elongated cambiform cells and sieve-tubes.\r\nAn unusually perfect specimen has been described by Renault[608] in\r\nwhich the phloem elements are preserved in silica. Fig. 72, _D_, is\r\ncopied from one of Renault’s drawings, the sieve-tubes, _s_, _s_,\r\nshow several distinct sieve-plates on the lateral walls of the tubes,\r\nreminding one to some extent of the sieve-tubes in a Bracken Fern.\r\nThe cells, _p_, _p_, associated with the sieve-tubes are square-ended\r\nelongated parenchymatous elements. Another characteristic feature\r\nillustrated by longitudinal sections is the nodal diaphragm; except in\r\nthe smallest branches the interior of each internode is hollow, and the\r\nring of vascular bundles is separated from the pith-cavity by a band\r\nof parenchymatous tissue. At each node this parenchyma extends across\r\nthe central cavity in the form of a nodal diaphragm, as in the stem of\r\n_Equisetum_.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of the petrified fragments of _Calamites_\r\nafford proof of cambial activity, and possess obvious secondary\r\ntissues. In exceptionally perfect specimens the xylem tracheids are\r\nfound to be succeeded externally by a few flattened thin-walled cells\r\nwhich are in a meristematic condition (fig. 72, _A_, _c_); these\r\nconstitute the cambium zone, and it is the _secondary structure_ that\r\nresults from the activity of the meristematic cells that we have now to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SECONDARY THICKENING.]\r\n\r\nIn petrified examples of branches in which the secondary thickening\r\nhas reached a fairly advanced stage, the wood is usually the outermost\r\ntissue preserved, the more external tissues having been detached along\r\nthe line of cambium cells. It is only in a few cases that we are able\r\nto examine all the tissues of older examples.\r\n\r\nThe specimen represented in fig. 73 illustrates very clearly the\r\nextension of the hollow pith up to the inner surface of the vascular\r\nring; the disorganisation of the pith-cells which had already begun in\r\nthe twig of fig. 71 has here advanced much further. The bluntly rounded\r\nprojections represent the prominent primary xylem strands, each of\r\nwhich is traversed by the characteristic carinal canal. Alternating\r\nwith the wedge-shaped groups of secondary xylem, _x_, we have the broad\r\nprincipal medullary rays, _mr_, which become slightly narrower towards\r\nthe outside. The inner face of each of these wide rays has a concave\r\nform, due to the less resistent nature of the medullary-ray cells as\r\ncompared with the stronger xylem. The regularly sinuous form of the\r\ninner face of the vascular cylinder enables one to realise how the\r\nCalamite-casts (figs. 82, 99, and 101) have come to have the regular\r\nridges and grooves on their surface. The broad ridges on the cast mark\r\nthe position of the wide medullary rays, while the grooves correspond\r\nto the more prominent ends of the vascular strands. The tissues\r\nexternal to the wood have not been preserved in the example shown in\r\nfig. 73. Some silicified specimens described by Stur[609] from Bohemia\r\nand now in the Museum of the Austrian Geological Survey, Vienna,\r\nadmirably illustrate the connection between the surface features of a\r\nCalamite cast and the anatomy of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.\r\n\r\n  Transverse section of a Calamite stem.\r\n  _mr_, medullary ray. After Williamson.\r\n  _x_, _x_, xylem. (No. 1933 A.A. in the Williamson Collection.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARTHROPITYS.]\r\n\r\nIn the large section of a calcareous nodule diagrammatically shown in\r\nfig. 17 II. (p. 85) the secondary wood of a slightly flattened Calamite\r\nis the most prominent plant fragment. The pith-cavity has been almost\r\nobliterated by the lateral compression of the woody cylinder, but the\r\npresence of the carinal canals along the inner edge of the wood may\r\nstill be readily recognised. The appearance presented by a transverse\r\nsection of the secondary wood of a Calamite is that of regular\r\nradial series of rather small rectangular tracheids, with occasional\r\nsecondary medullary rays consisting of narrow and radially elongated\r\nparenchymatous cells. The principal rays[610] in the _Arthropitys_ type\r\nof a Calamite stem are often found to gradually decrease in breadth\r\nas they pass into the secondary wood, until in the outer portion of\r\nthe wood the primary medullary rays are practically obliterated by the\r\nformation of interfascicular xylem.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 74, _A_, we have a portion of a single xylem group of a\r\nthick woody stem. The stem from which the figure has been drawn was\r\noriginally described by Binney[611] as _Calamodendron commune_; we\r\nnow recognise it as a typical example of the subgenus _Arthropitys_.\r\nThe specific term _communis_ was used by Ettingshausen[612] in 1855\r\nin a comprehensive sense to include more than twenty species of the\r\ngenus _Calamites_, but since Binney’s use of the term it has come to\r\nbe associated with a definite type of _Arthropitys_ stem, in which\r\nthe primary medullary rays decrease rapidly in breadth towards the\r\nperiphery of the wood. The wood of Binney’s stem[613] measures 2·5\r\ncm. across, but the pith-cavity has been crushed to the limits of a\r\nnarrow band represented in the figure by the shaded portion. The strand\r\nof cells, _s_, in the pith is a portion of a Stigmarian appendage\r\n(“rootlet”), which penetrated into the hollow stem of the Calamite\r\nand became petrified by the same agency to which the preservation of\r\nthe stem is due. These intruded Stigmarian appendages are of constant\r\noccurrence in the calcareous nodules; their intimate association with\r\nthe tissues of other plants is often a serious source of error in the\r\nidentification of petrified tissues. The inner portion of one of the\r\nxylem groups is shown in fig. 74, _A_. External to the carinal canal,\r\nthe xylem tracheids are disposed in regular series and associated with\r\nnumerous narrow secondary medullary rays. The width of the xylem wedge\r\nincreases gradually as we pass outwards, this is due to the formation\r\nof interfascicular xylem, which in the more peripheral portion of\r\nthe stem extends across the primary medullary rays. The few primary\r\nmedullary-ray cells shown in the drawing illustrate the characteristic\r\ntangentially elongated form and large size of the parenchymatous\r\nelements. Williamson and Scott have pointed out that the tangentially\r\nelongated form of the medullary-ray cells is the result of active\r\ngrowth, and not merely the expression of the tangential stretching of\r\nthe stem consequent on secondary thickening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Transverse section of part of a Calamite stem.

The secondary wood of a Calamite does not exhibit any\r\nregular zones of growth comparable with the annual rings of our forest\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.

From a section in the Binney Collection, × 50.]\r\n\r\nBefore passing to other examples of Calamitean stems, reference may be\r\nmade to the sections shown in figs. 75 and 76, which illustrate some\r\nfurther points in the structure of Binney’s stems. In fig. 75 the xylem\r\ntracheids are shown at _x_, and between them the secondary medullary\r\nrays present the appearance of long and narrow parenchymatous cells;\r\nas the section is tangential the characteristic scalariform character\r\nof the tracheids is not shown, the ladder-like bordered pits being\r\nconfined to the radial walls of the tracheal elements. The much greater\r\nlength than breadth of the cells which form the rays associated with\r\nthe xylem tracheids, is a characteristic feature in Calamitean stems.\r\nThe breadth of the principal ray, _m_, shows that the section has\r\npassed through the wood a short distance from the pith; in a tangential\r\nsection cut further into the wood the breadth of the principal rays\r\nwould be considerably reduced. The large medullary-ray tissue consists\r\nof square-walled parenchymatous cells. The more highly magnified\r\nsection, in fig. 76, shows a central group of parenchyma containing\r\na few transversely cut tracheids, but the two kinds of elements are\r\nnot clearly differentiated in the figure; this group of cells is an\r\noutgoing leaf-trace which is enclosed by the strongly curved tracheids\r\nof the stem. The section is taken from the node of a stem where several\r\nleaf-trace bundles are passing out to a whorl of leaves; the few cells\r\nintercalated between the tracheids belong to the parenchyma of the\r\nsecondary medullary rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76. Longitudinal tangential section of the same\r\n  Calamite as that of figs. 74 and 75, showing a leaf-trace\r\n  and curved tracheids at a node. From a section in the Binney\r\n  Collection, × 100.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARTHROPITYS. SURFACE FEATURES.]\r\n\r\nIn the small portion of a stem represented in fig. 74 _B_, the cortical\r\ntissues have been partially preserved; at the inner edge, next the\r\nhollow pith, there are two xylem groups, each with a carinal canal, and\r\nbetween them is part of a broad “principal” medullary ray[614]. The\r\ncambium has not been preserved, but beyond this region we have some\r\nof the large cells, _c_, of the inner cortex; these are followed by a\r\nfew remnants of a smaller-celled tissue, and external to this part of\r\nthe cortex there is a series of triangular groups, _h_, consisting of\r\nsmall thick-walled cells alternating with spaces which were originally\r\noccupied by more delicate parenchyma. The darker groups constitute\r\nhypodermal strands of mechanical tissue or stereome which lent support\r\nto the stem. The surface of a stem possessing such supporting strands\r\nwould probably assume a longitudinally wrinkled or grooved appearance\r\non drying; the intervening parenchyma, contracting and yielding more\r\nreadily, would tend to produce shallow grooves alternating with the\r\nridges above the stereome strands.\r\n\r\nThe complete section of the stem of which a small portion is shown\r\nin fig. 74 _B_, is figured by Williamson[615] in his 12th memoir on\r\nCoal-Measure plants. The section was obtained from Ashton-under-Lyne\r\nin Lancashire; it illustrates very clearly a method of preservation\r\nwhich is occasionally met with among petrified plants. The walls of the\r\nvarious tissue elements are black in colour and somewhat ragged, and\r\nthe general appearance of the section is similar to that of a section\r\nof a charred piece of stem. It is possible that the Calamite twig was\r\nreduced to charcoal before petrifaction by a lightning flash or some\r\nother cause.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that the surface of a Calamite stem was probably\r\nmarked by regular ridges and grooves similar to those of the\r\npith-cast, and that such external features are connected with the\r\narrangement of the tissues in the vascular cylinder. The indication\r\nof grooves and ridges on the bark of fossil Calamites is no doubt the\r\nresult of the existence in the hypoderm of firm strands alternating\r\nwith strands of less resistant cells. It is very common to find\r\nCalamite pith-casts covered with a layer of coal presenting a ribbed\r\nsurface, but this is simply due to the moulding of the coaly film on an\r\ninternal pith-cast. The broad grooves on such a specimen as that of\r\nfig. 77 are, on the other hand, probably an indication of the existence\r\nof hypoderm bands similar to those in fig. 74 _B_, _h_. The specimen\r\nfrom which fig. 77 is drawn shows many interesting features. The figure\r\ngiven by Grand’Eury, of which fig. 77 is a copy, is somewhat idealised,\r\nbut the various surfaces can be made out in the fossil. The surface\r\nof the coaly envelope surrounding the pith-cast, _a_, is distinctly\r\ngrooved, but the depressions have nothing to do with the surface\r\nfeatures of the wood or the pith-cast; they are no doubt due to the\r\noccurrence of alternating bands of thick- and thin-walled tissue in the\r\nhypodermal region of the cortex; the peripheral strands of bast cells\r\nwould stand out as prominent ribs as the stem tissue contracted during\r\nfossilisation. At _b_ (fig. 77) we have a view of the wood in which the\r\nposition of the principal rays is indicated by fine longitudinal lines\r\nat regular intervals; the oval projections just below the nodal line\r\nare probably the casts of infranodal canals (_cf._ p. 324). At _a_ the\r\ncharacteristic pith-cast is seen with a small branch-scar on the node.\r\nThe scar on the middle node, _N_ 2, is probably that of a root, and a\r\nroot _R_ is still attached to the node, _N_ 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.

This is illustrated on\r\na large scale by a unique specimen originally described by Williamson\r\nin 1878[616]. Figs. 78 and 79 represent transverse and longitudinal\r\nsections of this stem. This unusually large petrified stem was found\r\nin the Coal-Measures of Oldham, in Lancashire. In the slightly reduced\r\ndrawing, fig. 78, the large and somewhat flattened pith, _p_, 4·2 cm.\r\nin diameter, is shown towards the bottom of the figure. Surrounding\r\nthis we have 58 or 59 wedge-shaped projecting xylem groups and broad\r\nmedullary rays; the latter soon become indistinguishable as they\r\nare traced radially through the thick mass of secondary wood, 5 cm.\r\nwide, composed of scalariform tracheids and secondary medullary rays\r\n(fig. 78, 3). The secondary wood presents the features characteristic\r\nof _Calamites_ (_Arthropitys_) _communis_ (Binney). External to\r\nthe wood there is a broken-up mass, about 5·5 cm. wide composed of\r\nregularly arranged (fig. 78, 2) and rather thick-walled cells; this\r\nconsists of periderm, a secondary tissue, which has been developed\r\nby a cork-cambium during the increase in girth of the plant. The\r\nmore delicate cortical tissues have not been preserved, and the more\r\nresistant portion of the bark has been broken up into small pieces of\r\ncorky tissue, among which are seen numerous Stigmarian appendages,\r\npieces of sporangia and other plant fragments. These associated\r\nstructures cannot of course be shown in the small-scale drawing of the\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.\r\n\r\n  1.

The\r\nmottled or watered appearance of the wood is due to numerous medullary\r\nrays which sweep across the tracheids. The periderm elements, as seen\r\nin longitudinal section, are fibrous in form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79. Longitudinal section of the specimen stem in\r\n  fig. 78. From a specimen in the Williamson Collection, British\r\n  Museum (no. 80). ⅔ nat. size.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CALLUS WOOD.]\r\n\r\nThe development of cork in a younger Calamite stem is clearly shown in\r\na specimen described by Williamson and Scott in their Memoir of 1894.\r\nIn a transverse section of the stem several large cells of the inner\r\ncortex are seen to be in process of division by tangential walls, and\r\ngiving rise to radially arranged periderm tissue[617].\r\n\r\nThe section diagrammatically sketched in fig. 80 is that of a Calamite\r\ntwig in which the wood appears to have been injured, and the wound has\r\nbeen almost covered over by the formation of callus wood. The young\r\ntrees in a Palaeozoic forest might easily be injured by some of the\r\nlarge amphibians, which were the highest representatives of animal\r\nlife during the Carboniferous period, just as our forest trees are\r\noften barked by deer, rabbits, and other animals. Fissures might also\r\nbe formed by the expansion of the bark under the heating influence of\r\nthe sun’s rays[618]. Such a specimen as that of fig. 80 gives an air\r\nof living reality to the petrified fragments of the Coal period trees.\r\nIt is well known how a wound on the branch of a forest tree becomes\r\ngradually overgrown by the activity of the cambium giving rise to a\r\nthick callus, which gradually closes over the wounded surface in the\r\nform of two lips of wood which finally meet over the middle of the\r\nscar. The two lips of callus are clearly shown in the fossil branch\r\narching over the tear in the wood just beyond the ring of carinal\r\ncanals. The tissue external to the wood represents the imperfectly\r\npreserved cortex. A section which was cut parallel to that of fig. 80\r\nshows a continuous band of wood beyond the wound, and the latter has\r\nthe form of a small triangular gap; this section appears to have passed\r\nacross the wound where it was narrower and has already been closed over\r\nby the callus. The formation of a rather different kind of callus wood\r\nhas been described by Renault[619] and by Williamson and Scott[620],\r\nin stems where aborted or deciduous branches have been overgrown and\r\nsealed up by cambial activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80. Diagrammatic sketch of a transverse section of\r\n  a Calamite twig, showing callus wood. From a specimen in the\r\n  Cambridge Botanical Laboratory Collection. × _ca._ 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81. _Calamites._ Longitudinal section (_R_, radial;\r\n  _T_, tangential) of a small branch. _b_, position of a lateral\r\n  branch. From a specimen (no. 1937) in the Williamson Collection.\r\n  Slightly enlarged.]\r\n\r\nSome of the features to be noticed in longitudinal sections of Calamite\r\nstems have already been described, at least as regards younger\r\nbranches. The specimen shown in fig. 81 illustrates the general\r\nappearance of a stem as seen in tangential and radial section. In the\r\nlower portion, _T_, the course of the vascular bundles is shown by\r\nthe black lines which represent the xylem tracheids, bifurcating and\r\nusually alternating at each node. Between the xylem strands are the\r\nbroad principal medullary rays. At _b_ a branch has been cut through\r\non its passage out from the parent stem, just above the nodal line. In\r\ntangential sections of Calamite stems one frequently sees both branches\r\nand leaf-trace bundles (fig. 83, _A_), passing horizontally through\r\nthe wood and enclosed by strongly curved and twisted tracheids. In the\r\nupper part of the figure (81, _R_), the section has passed through the\r\ncentre of the stem, and the wood is seen in radial view; each node is\r\nbridged across by a diaphragm of parenchymatous cells capable of giving\r\nrise to a surface layer of periderm[621].\r\n\r\nAn outgoing branch, as seen in a tangential section of a stem, consists\r\nof a parenchymatous pith surrounded by a ring of vascular bundles, in\r\nwhich the characteristic carinal canals have not yet been formed, but\r\nif the section has cut the branch further from its base, there may be\r\nseen a circle of irregular gaps marking the position of the carinal\r\ncanals. Such gaps are often occupied by thin parenchyma, and contain\r\nprotoxylem elements. The outgoing branches, as seen in a tangential\r\nsection of a Calamite stem, are seen to be connected with the wood of\r\nthe parent stem by curved and sinuous tracheids, which give to the\r\nstem-wood a curiously characteristic appearance[622], as if the xylem\r\nelements had been pushed aside and contorted by the pressure of the\r\noutgoing member. A tangential section through a Pine stem[623] in the\r\nregion of a lateral branch presents precisely the same features as in\r\n_Calamites_. The branches are given off from the stem immediately above\r\na node and usually between two outgoing leaf-trace bundles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RHIZOME OF CALAMITES.]\r\n\r\nSpecimens of pith-casts occasionally present the appearance of a\r\ncurved and rapidly tapered ram’s horn, and the narrow end of such a\r\ncast is sometimes found in contact with the node of another cast. This\r\njuxtaposition of casts is shown unusually well in fig. 82. In some of\r\nthe published restorations of _Calamites_ the plant is represented as\r\nhaving thick branches attached to the main stem by little more than\r\na point. Williamson[624] clearly explained this apparently unusual\r\nand indeed physically impossible method of branching, by means of\r\nsections of petrified stems. The branches seen in fig. 82 are of\r\ncourse pith-casts, and in the living plant the pith of each branch was\r\nsurrounded by a mass of secondary wood developed from as many primary\r\ngroups of xylem as there are grooves on the surface of the cast, each\r\nof the grooves on an internode corresponding to the projecting edge\r\nof a xylem group. At the junction of one branch with another the pith\r\nwas much narrower and the enclosing wood thicker, so that the tapered\r\nends of the cast merely show the continuity by a narrow union between\r\nthe pith-cavities of different branches. Most probably the casts of\r\nfig. 82 are those of a branched rhizome which grew underground, giving\r\noff aerial shoots and adventitious roots. There is a fairly close\r\nresemblance between the Calamite casts of fig. 82 and a stout branching\r\nrhizome of a Bamboo, _e.g._ _Bambusa arundinacea_ Willd.; it is not\r\nsurprising that the earlier writers looked upon the Calamite as a\r\nreed-like plant.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the consideration of stem structures there is another\r\nfeature to which attention must be drawn. On the casts shown in fig. 82\r\nthere is a circle of small oval scars situated just below the nodes,\r\nthese are clearly shown at _c_, _c_, _c_. Each of the scars is in\r\nreality a slight projection from the upper end of an internodal ridge.\r\nAs the ridges correspond to the broad inner faces of medullary rays,\r\nthe small projection at the upper end of each ridge is a cast of a\r\ndepression or canal which existed in the medullary tissue of the living\r\nplant. There have been various suggestions as to the meaning of these\r\noval projections; several writers have referred to them as the points\r\nof attachments of roots or other appendages, but Williamson proved them\r\nto be the casts of canal-like gaps which traversed the upper ends of\r\nprincipal medullary rays in a horizontal direction. In a tangential\r\nsection of a Calamite stem the summit of each primary medullary ray\r\noften contains a group of smaller elements which are in process of\r\ndisorganisation, and in some cases these cells give place to an oval\r\nand somewhat irregular canal. In the diagrammatic tangential section\r\nrepresented in fig. 83, _A_ the upper end of each ray is perforated\r\nby a large oval space, which has been formed as the result of the\r\nbreaking down of a horizontal band of cells. Williamson designated\r\nthese spaces _infranodal canals_. While proving that they had nothing\r\nto do with the attachment of lateral members, he suggested that they\r\nmight be concerned with secretion; but their physiological significance\r\nis still a matter of speculation. The casts of infranodal canals are\r\nespecially large and conspicuous in the subgenus _Arthrodendron_,\r\na form of Calamite characterised by certain histological features\r\nto be referred to later. Williamson[625] originally regarded the\r\npresence of infranodal canals as one of the distinguishing features of\r\n_Arthrodendron_, but they occur also in the casts of the commoner type\r\n_Arthropitys_. As a rule we have only the cast of the inner ends of the\r\ninfranodal canals preserved as slight projections like those in fig.\r\n83, _A_; but in one exceptionally interesting pith-cast described by\r\nWilliamson, these casts of the infranodal canals have been preserved as\r\nslender spoke-like columns radiating from the upper ends of the ridges\r\nof the infranodal region of a pith-cast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82. Branched rhizome of _Calamites_. ½ nat. size.\r\n  _C_, _C_, nodes showing casts of infranodal canals.\r\n  From a specimen in the Manchester Museum, Owens College.]\r\n\r\nThis specimen, which was figured by Williamson[626] in two of his\r\npapers, and by Lyell[627] in the fifth edition of his _Elementary\r\nGeology_, is historically interesting as being one of the first\r\nimportant plants obtained by Williamson early in the fifties, when he\r\nbegan his researches into the structure of Carboniferous plants. A\r\njoiner, who was employed by Williamson to make a piece of machinery\r\nfor grinding fossils, brought a number of sandstone fragments as an\r\noffering to his employer, whom he found to be interested in stones.\r\nThe specimens “were in the main the merest rubbish, but amongst them,”\r\nwrites Williamson, “I detected a fragment which was equally elegant\r\nand remarkable.... In later days, when the specimen so oddly and\r\naccidentally obtained, came to be intelligently studied, its history\r\nbecame clear enough, and the priceless fragment is now one of the most\r\nprecious gems in my cabinet[628].”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Comparison of three types of structure met with in Calamitean\r\n       stems_,—Arthropitys, Arthrodendron, _and_ Calamodendron.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARTHROPITYS.]\r\n\r\nThe anatomical features which have so far been described as\r\ncharacteristic of _Calamites_ represent the common type met with in the\r\nEnglish Coal-Measures. The same type occurs also in France, Germany and\r\nelsewhere. It is that form of stem known as _Arthropitys_, a sub-genus\r\nof _Calamites_.\r\n\r\n_Arthropitys_ may be briefly diagnosed as follows,—confining our\r\nattention to the structure of the stem: A ring of collateral bundles\r\nsurrounds a large hollow pith, each primary xylem strand terminates\r\ninternally in a more or less bluntly rounded apex traversed by a\r\nlongitudinally carinal canal. The principal medullary rays consist of\r\nlarge-celled parenchyma, of which the individual elements are usually\r\ntangentially elongated as seen in transverse section, and four or five\r\ntimes longer than broad as seen in a tangential longitudinal section.\r\nThe secondary xylem consists of scalariform and reticulately pitted\r\ntracheids; the interfascicular xylem may be formed completely across\r\neach primary ray at an early stage in the growth of the stem[629], or\r\nit may be developed more gradually so as to leave a tapering principal\r\nray of parenchyma between each primary xylem bundle. In the latter\r\ncase the principal rays present the characteristic appearance shown in\r\nfigs. 71, 74, _A_, 75 and 78, a type of stem which we may refer to as\r\n_Calamites_ (_Arthropitys_) _communis_. In the former case the stem\r\npresents the appearance shown in fig. 83, _D_[630]. A third variety\r\nof _Arthropitys_ stem is one which was originally named by Göppert\r\n_Arthropitys bistriata_; in this form the principal rays retain their\r\nindividuality as bands of parenchyma throughout the whole thickness\r\nof the wood[631]. Such stems as those of figs. 73 and 74, _B_, may be\r\nyoung examples of _Arthropitys communis_ or possibly of _A. bistriata_.\r\nThe narrow secondary medullary rays of _Arthropitys_ usually consist of\r\na single row of cells which are three to five times higher than broad,\r\nas seen in tangential longitudinal section. Infranodal canals occur in\r\nsome examples of _Arthropitys_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARTHRODENDRON.]\r\n\r\nIn the subgenus _Arthrodendron_, a type of stem first recognised\r\nby Williamson and named by him _Calamopitys_[632], the principal\r\nmedullary rays consist of _prosenchymatous cells_ (_i.e._ elongated\r\npointed elements) and not parenchyma. These elongated elements are\r\nnot pitted like tracheids, and they are shorter and broader than the\r\nxylem elements. In some examples of this subgenus the primary rays\r\nare bridged across at an early stage by the formation of secondary\r\ninterfascicular xylem, and in others they persist as bands of ray\r\ntissue, as in _Arthropitys_. Other characteristics of _Arthrodendron_\r\nare the abundance of reticulated instead of scalariform tracheids in\r\nthe secondary wood, and the large size of the infranodal canals.\r\n\r\nFig. 83, _D_ represents part of a transverse section of\r\n_Arthrodendron_; in this stem the rays have been occupied by\r\ninterfascicular xylem at a very early stage of the secondary growth.\r\nThe section from which fig. 83, _D_ is drawn was described by\r\nWilliamson in 1871; the complete section shows about 80 carinal canals\r\nand primary xylem groups. The prosenchymatous form of the principal\r\nmedullary rays is seen in fig 83, _C_, and the reticulate pitting on\r\nthe radial wall of a tracheid is shown in fig. 83, _B_. Fig. 83, _A_\r\nillustrates the large infranodal canals as seen in a tangential section\r\nof a stem. The same section shows also the course of the vascular\r\nbundles characteristic of _Calamites_ as of _Equisetum_, and the\r\nposition of outgoing leaf-traces is represented by unshaded areas in\r\nthe black vascular strands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83. _Calamites_ (_Arthrodendron_).\r\n\r\n  _A._ Tangential section (diagrammatic) showing the course of the\r\n      vascular strands, also leaf-traces and infranodal canals.\r\n  _B._ Radial face of a tracheid.\r\n  _C._ Prosenchymatous elements of a principal medullary ray.\r\n  _D._ Transverse section of the wood. (After Williamson.) No. 36 in\r\n      the Williamson Collection.]\r\n\r\nThe subgenus _Arthrodendron_ is very rarely met with, and our\r\ninformation as to this type is far from complete[633].\r\n\r\nThe third subgenus _Calamodendron_ has not been discovered in English\r\nrocks, and our knowledge of this type is derived from French and\r\nGerman silicified specimens[634]. There is the same large hollow\r\npith surrounded by a ring of collateral bundles with carinal canals,\r\nas in the two preceding subgenera. The tracheids are scalariform\r\nand reticulate, and the secondary medullary rays consist of rows of\r\nparenchymatous cells which are longer than broad, as in _Arthropitys_\r\nand _Arthrodendron_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84. _Calamites_ (_Calamodendron_) _intermedium_, Ren.\r\n  Transverse section through two vascular bundles.\r\n  _a_, _a_, xylem tracheids, _b_, _b_, bands of prosenchyma, _c_,\r\n      medullary ray. (After Renault.)]\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic feature of _Calamodendron_ is the occurrence of\r\nseveral rows of radially disposed thick-walled prosenchymatous elements\r\n(fig. 84, _b_) on either flank of each wedge-shaped group of xylem.\r\nEach principal ray is thus nearly filled up by bands of fibrous cells\r\non the sides of adjacent xylem groups, but the centre of each principal\r\nray is occupied by a narrow band of parenchyma (fig. 84, _c_). The\r\nrelative breadth of the xylem and prosenchymatous bands has been made\r\nuse of by Renault as a specific character in _Calamodendron_ stems.\r\nFig. 84 is copied from a drawing recently published by this French\r\nauthor of a new species of _Calamodendron_, _C. intermedium_[635]. In\r\nthis case the bands of fibrous cells, _b_, are slightly broader, as\r\nseen in a transverse section of the stem, than the bands of xylem\r\ntracheids, _a_. The narrow band, _c_, consists of four rows of the\r\nparenchymatous tissue of a medullary ray. At the inner end of each\r\ngroup of tracheids there is a large carinal canal.\r\n\r\nThe question of the recognition of the pith-casts of stems possessing\r\nthe structure of any of the three subgenera of _Calamites_ is referred\r\nto in a later section of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _b._ _Leaves_\r\n\r\n  _Leaves of Calamites and Calamitean foliage-shoots, including an\r\n      account of_ (α) Calamocladus (Asterophyllites) _and_ (β)\r\n      Annularia.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the structure and manner of occurrence of Calamite\r\nleaves is very incomplete. There are numerous foliage-shoots among the\r\nfossils of the Coal-Measures which are no doubt Calamitean, but as\r\nthey are nearly always found apart from the main branches and stems,\r\nit is generally impossible to do more than speak of them as probably\r\nthe leaf-bearing branches of a Calamite. The familiar fossils known\r\nas _Asterophyllites_, and in recent years often referred to the genus\r\n_Calamocladus_, are no doubt Calamitean shoots; but they are usually\r\nfound as isolated fragments, and it is seldom that we are able to refer\r\nthem to definite forms of _Calamites_. Another common Coal-Measure\r\ngenus, _Annularia_, is also Calamitean, and at least some of the\r\nspecies are no doubt leafy shoots of _Calamites_. Although it is\r\ngenerally accepted that the fossils referred to as _Asterophyllites_\r\nor _Calamocladus_ are portions of _Calamites_, and not distinct\r\nplants, it is convenient, and indeed necessary, to retain such a term\r\nas _Calamocladus_ as a means of recording foliage-shoots, which may\r\npossess both a botanical and a geological value.\r\n\r\nSome of the Calamite casts, especially those referred to the subgenus\r\n_Calamitina_, are occasionally found with leaves attached to the nodes.\r\nIn some stems the leaves are arranged in a close verticil, and each\r\nleaf has a narrow linear form and is traversed by a single median vein.\r\nFigures of Calamite stems with verticils of long and narrow leaves\r\nmay be found in Lindley and Hutton[636], and in the writings of many\r\nother authors[637]. In the specimen shown in fig. 85 the leaves are\r\npreserved apart from the stem, but from their close association with\r\na Calamite cast, and from the proofs afforded by other specimens, it\r\nis quite certain they formed part of a whorl of leaves attached to the\r\nnode of a true Calamite, and a stem having that particular type known\r\nas _Calamitina_[638] (figs. 99, 100). It is probable that in some\r\nCalamites, and especially in younger shoots, the leaves had the form of\r\nnarrow sheaths split up into linear segments. This question has already\r\nbeen referred to in dealing with certain Palaeozoic fossils referred to\r\n_Equisetites_[639].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85. Linear leaves of a Calamite (_Calamitina_).\r\n  After Weiss, slightly reduced.]\r\n\r\nA few years ago the late Thomas Hick[640], of Manchester, described\r\nthe structure of some leaves which he believed to be those of a\r\nCalamite. He found them attached to a slender axis which possessed the\r\ncharacteristics of a young Calamite branch. There can be little doubt\r\nthat his specimens are true Calamite leaves. The sketches of fig. 86\r\nhave been made from the sections originally described by Hick. Fig.\r\n86, 1 shows a leaf in transverse section; on the outside there is a\r\nwell-defined epidermal layer with a limiting cuticle. Internal to\r\nthis we have radially elongated parenchymatous cells forming a loose\r\nor spongy tissue, the cells being often separated by fairly large\r\nspaces (fig. 86, 5), especially in the region of the blunt lateral\r\nwings of the leaf. Some of these cells contain a single dark dot, which\r\nin all probability is the mineralised nucleus. These pallisade-like\r\ncells probably contained chlorophyll and constituted the assimilating\r\ntissue of the leaf. In the centre there is a circular strand of cells\r\nlimited by a layer of larger cells with black contents, enclosing an\r\ninner group of small-celled parenchyma and traversed by a few spiral\r\nor scalariform tracheids constituting the single median vein. It is\r\nhardly possible to recognise any phloem elements in the small vascular\r\nbundle; there appear to be a few narrow tracheids surrounded by larger\r\nparenchymatous elements (fig. 86, 2). At one point in the epidermis\r\nof fig. 86, 1, there appears to be a stoma, but the details are not\r\nvery clearly shown (fig. 86, 4); the two cells, _s_, _s_, bordering the\r\nsmall aperture are probably guard-cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86. A leaf of _Calamites_.\r\n\r\n  1. Transverse section; _t_, vascular bundle; _x_, sheath of cells.\r\n    × 35.\r\n  2. Vascular bundle consisting of a few small tracheids, _t_.\r\n  3.

Pallisade cells and intercellular spaces.\r\n  From a section in the Manchester Museum, Owens College.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the assimilating tissue, the comparatively thick band of\r\nthin-walled cells with intercellular spaces, and the exposed position\r\nof the stomata suggest that the plant lived in a fairly damp climate;\r\nat least there is nothing to indicate any adaptation to a dry climate.\r\n\r\nIn the Binney collection of plants in the Woodwardian Museum,\r\nCambridge, there is a species of a very small shoot bearing three or\r\nfour verticils of leaves which possess the same structure as those of\r\nfig. 86. We may probably regard such twigs as the slender terminal\r\nbranches of Calamitean shoots.\r\n\r\n\r\n                α. _Calamocladus_ (_Asterophyllites_).\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Asterophyllites_ was proposed by Brongniart[641] in\r\n1822 for a fossil previously named by Schlotheim[642] _Casuarinites_,\r\nand afterwards transferred to Sternberg’s genus _Annularia_. In 1828\r\nBrongniart[643] gave the following diagnosis of the fossils which he\r\nincluded under the genus _Asterophyllites_:—“Stems rarely simple,\r\nusually branched, with opposite branches, which are always disposed in\r\nthe same plane; leaves flat, more or less linear, pointed, traversed by\r\na simple median vein, free to the base.” Lindley and Hutton described\r\nexamples of Brongniart’s genus as species of _Hippurites_[644], and\r\nother authors adopted different names for specimens afterwards referred\r\nto _Asterophyllites_.\r\n\r\nAt a later date Ettingshausen[645] and other writers expressed the\r\nview that the fossils which Brongniart regarded as a distinct genus\r\nwere the foliage-shoots of _Calamites_, and Ettingshausen went so far\r\nas to include them in that genus. In view of the generally expressed\r\nopinion as to the Calamitean nature of _Asterophyllites_, Schimper[646]\r\nproposed the convenient generic name _Calamocladus_ for “rami et\r\nramuli foliosi” of _Calamites_. Some recent authors have adopted this\r\ngenus, but others prefer to retain _Asterophyllites_. In a recent\r\nimportant monograph by Grand’Eury[647] Calamitean foliage-shoots are\r\nincluded under the two names, _Asterophyllites_ and _Calamocladus_;\r\nthe latter type of foliage-shoots he associates with the stems of\r\nthe subgenus _Calamodendron_, and the former he connects with those\r\nCalamitean stems which belong to the subgenus _Arthropitys_.\r\n\r\nIt is an almost hopeless task to attempt to connect the various forms\r\nof foliage-shoots with their respective stems, and to determine what\r\nparticular anatomical features characterised the plants bearing\r\nthese various forms of shoots. We may adopt Schimper’s generic name\r\n_Calamocladus_ in the same sense as _Asterophyllites_, but as including\r\nsuch other foliage-shoots as we have reason to believe belonged to\r\n_Calamites_. Those leaf-bearing branches which conform to the type\r\nknown as _Annularia_ are however not included in _Calamocladus_, as\r\nwe cannot definitely assert that these foliage-shoots belong in all\r\ncases to Calamitean stems. Grand’Eury’s use of _Calamocladus_ in a\r\nmore restricted sense is inadvisable as leading to confusion, seeing\r\nthat this name was originally defined in a more comprehensive manner\r\nas including Calamitean leaf-bearing branches generally. We may define\r\n_Calamocladus_ as follows:—\r\n\r\nBranched or simple articulated branches bearing whorls of uni-nerved\r\nlinear leaves at the nodes; the leaves may be either free to the\r\nbase or fused basally into a cup-like sheath (_e.g._ Grand’Eury’s\r\n_Calamocladus_). The several acicular linear leaves or segments which\r\nare given off from the nodes spread out radially in an open manner in\r\nall directions; they may be either almost at right angles to the axis\r\nor inclined at different angles. Each segment is traversed by a single\r\nvein and terminates in an acuminate apex.\r\n\r\nAs a typical example of a Calamitean foliage-shoot the species\r\n_Calamocladus equisetiformis_ (Schloth.) may be briefly described. The\r\nsynonymy of the commoner species of fossil plants is a constant source\r\nof confusion and difficulty; in order to illustrate the necessity of\r\ncareful comparison of specimens and published illustrations, it may be\r\nhelpful to quote a few synonyms of the species more particularly dealt\r\nwith. The exhaustive lists drawn up by Kidston in his _Catalogue of\r\nPalaeozoic plants in the British Museum_ will be found extremely useful\r\nby those concerned with a systematic study of the older plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87. _Calamocladus equisetiformis_ (Schloth.).\r\n  From a specimen in the British Museum (McMurtrie Collection, no.

It is from the Radstock coal-field of Somersetshire,\r\none of the best English localities for Coal-Measure plants. An\r\nexceedingly good collection of Radstock plants has recently been\r\npresented to the British Museum by Mr J. McMurtrie; it includes many\r\nfine specimens of _Calamites_. A small example—probably of this\r\nspecies—from Coalbrook Dale, near Dudley, in Shropshire, and now in the\r\nBritish Museum, illustrates very well the appearance of a young and\r\npartially expanded Calamitean foliage-shoot. The central axis, 6·5\r\ncm. in length, includes about 15 internodes, and terminates in a bud\r\ncovered by several small leaves. Lateral branches are given off at a\r\nwide angle, and small unexpanded buds occur in the axils of several of\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the leaf-bearing branches which Grand’Eury has\r\nrecently described as _Calamocladus_, using the genus in a more\r\nrestricted sense than is adopted in the present chapter, reference may\r\nbe made to the fragment shown in fig. 68, _A_. The foliage-shoots of\r\nthis type bore verticils of linear leaves, coherent basally in the form\r\nof a cup, at the ends of branches and not in a succession of whorls on\r\neach branch. The association of reproductive organs, in the form of\r\nlong and narrow strobili, with _Calamocladus_ is referred to in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\nThe specimens described by Grand’Eury are in the École des Mines\r\nMuseum, Paris; some of the shoots which are well preserved bear a\r\nresemblance in habit of growth to the genus _Archaeocalamites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            β. _Annularia._\r\n\r\nIn 1820 this generic name was applied by Sternberg[656] to some\r\nspecimens of branches bearing verticils of linear leaves. In 1828\r\nBrongniart[657] thus defined the genus _Annularia_:—“Slender stem,\r\narticulated, with opposite branches arising above the leaves. Leaves\r\nverticillate, flat, frequently obtuse, traversed by a single vein,\r\nfused basally and of unequal length.”\r\n\r\nIn the works of earlier writers we find frequent illustrations of\r\nspecimens of _Annularia_, which are compared with Asters and other\r\nrecent flowering plants. Lehmann[658] contributed a paper to the Royal\r\nAcademy of Berlin in 1756, in which he referred to certain fossil\r\nplants as probable examples of flowers, among them being a specimen\r\nof _Annularia_. He refers to the occurrence of fossil ferns and other\r\nplants, and asks why we do not find flowers of the rose or tulip;\r\nhis object being “not to acquire vain glory, but to give occasion for\r\nothers to look into the matter more clearly.”\r\n\r\nThe general habit of the fossils which are now included under\r\n_Annularia_ agrees closely with that of _Calamocladus_. There is the\r\nsame spreading form and a similar foliage in the two genera, but in\r\n_Annularia_ the members of a whorl are always fused into a basal\r\nsheath, and the segments are not of equal length. We may thus summarise\r\nthe characteristic features of the genus:—\r\n\r\nOpposite branches are given off in one plane from the nodes of a\r\nmain axis; the leaves are in the form of narrow sheaths divided into\r\nnumerous and unequal linear or narrow lanceolate segments, each with\r\na median vein. The segments in each whorl appear to be spread out in\r\none plane very oblique to the axis of a branch, instead of spreading\r\nradially in all directions; the lateral segments are usually longer\r\nthan the upper and lower members of a whorl. The vegetative branches\r\npossess the same type of structure as _Calamites_.\r\n\r\nA comparison of _Annularia_ and _Phyllotheca_ has already been\r\nmade in Chapter IX. (p. 282). Potonié[659] has recently given a\r\ndetailed account of Annularian leaves; he compares them with those\r\nof _Equisetum_, and describes the occurrence on the lamina of each\r\nleaf-segment of a broad central band or midrib, with a groove, probably\r\ncontaining stomata, on either side. He shows that in well-preserved\r\nspecimens of _Annularia_, it is possible to recognise certain minute\r\nsurface-features, such as the presence of hairs and stomata, which\r\nenable one to detect a close resemblance between the leaves of Calamite\r\nstems and those of Annularian shoots.\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to distinguish between _Annularia_ and\r\n_Calamocladus_; the collar-like basal sheath in the leaves of the\r\nformer is a characteristic feature, but that cannot always be\r\nrecognised. On the other hand, the leaves of _Calamocladus_ may\r\nsometimes be flattened out on the surface of the rock and simulate the\r\ndeeply cut sheaths of _Annularia_. It is difficult to decide how far\r\nthe manner of occurrence of Annularian leaves in one plane, which is\r\ncommonly insisted on as a generic character, is an original feature, or\r\nhow far it is the result of compression in fossilisation. Probably the\r\nleaves of a living _Annularia_ were spread out at right angles to the\r\naxis, as in the ‘verticils’ of such a plant as _Galium_.\r\n\r\nDawson[660] has described some fossils from the Devonian rocks of\r\nCanada as species of _Asterophyllites_; the figures bear a closer\r\nresemblance to the genus _Annularia_. The same author figures some\r\nirregularly whorled impressions as _Protannularia_, which appear to be\r\nidentical with a fossil described by Nicholson[661] from the Skiddaw\r\nslates (Ordovician) of Cumberland as _Buthotrephis radiata_, but the\r\nspecimens are too imperfect to admit of accurate determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Annularia stellata_ (Schloth.).

Primary\r\nbranches given off in opposite pairs from the nodes, the lateral\r\nbranches giving off smaller branches disposed in the same manner. The\r\nsmaller branches bear verticils of leaves at each node; both leaves\r\nand ultimate branches being in one plane. The leaves are narrow,\r\nlanceolate-spathulate in form, broadest about the middle, 1–5 cm. in\r\nlength and 1–3 mm. broad, hairy on the upper surface[669]; each leaf is\r\ntraversed by a single vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88. Branch of _Annularia stellata_ (Schloth.). ⅘\r\n  nat. size. From a specimen in the Collection of Mr R. Kidston.\r\n  Upper Coal-Measures, Radstock.]\r\n\r\nEach whorl contains 16–32 segments, which are connected basally into\r\na collar or narrow sheath; the lateral segments are usually longer\r\nthan the upper and lower. The branches are about 6–20 mm. broad, with\r\nfinely ribbed internodes 3–7 cm. long, bearing verticils of leaves; the\r\nultimate branches arise in pairs in the axils of the lateral segments\r\nof the verticils.\r\n\r\nThe strobili are of the _Calamostachys_[670] type and are borne on the\r\nmain branches or possibly on the stem; they have a long and narrow form\r\nand are attached in verticils at the nodes. Each strobilus consists of\r\na central axis bearing alternate whorls of linear lanceolate sterile\r\nbracts and sporangiophores, about half as numerous as the sterile\r\nbracts; each sporangiophore bears four ovoid sporangia.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical structure of a specimen referred to _Annularia stellata_\r\nhas been described by Renault[671]. The cortex consists of parenchyma\r\ntraversed by lacunae and limited peripherally by a denser hypodermal\r\ntissue. In the stele Renault describes 14 xylem strands, each with a\r\nlarge carinal canal. The pith was apparently large and hollow. The\r\nsame author describes an _Annularia_ strobilus in which the lower\r\nsporangiophores bear macrosporangia, and the upper microsporangia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89. _Annularia sphenophylloides_ (Zenk.).\r\n  _A._ Strobilus (_Stachannularia calathifera_, Weiss). ⅔ nat. size.\r\n      _B._ Vegetative shoot. ⅘ nat. size.\r\n  From specimens in the Collection of Mr R.

The leaf-verticils\r\nand branches are all in one plane. Each verticil consists of 12–18\r\nspathulate segments, 3–10 mm. long, cuneiform at the base and broader\r\nabove, with an acuminate tip; the lateral segments are slightly longer\r\nthan the upper and lower members of a whorl.\r\n\r\nThe small and crowded leaf-whorls give to this species a characteristic\r\nappearance, which readily distinguishes it from the larger-leaved\r\nforms such as _Annularia stellata_. A fossil figured by Lhwyd[676]\r\nin 1699 as _Rubeola mineralis_ is no doubt an example of _Annularia\r\nsphenophylloides_.\r\n\r\nAnnularian branches are occasionally found with cones given off\r\nfrom the axils of some of the leaf-whorls. An interesting specimen,\r\nwhich is now in the Leipzig Museum, was described by Sterzel in\r\n1882[677], showing cones attached to a vegetative shoot of _Annularia\r\nsphenophylloides_. The long and narrow strobili—2·5 cm. long and\r\nabout 6 mm. broad—appear very large in proportion to the size of the\r\nvegetative branches. A fertile shoot consists of a central axis bearing\r\nwhorls of bracts alternating with sporangiophores, to each of which\r\nare attached four sporangia. The specimen in fig. 89, _A_, does not\r\nshow the details clearly; each transverse constriction represents the\r\nattachment of a whorl of linear bracts; the whole cone appears to\r\nconsist of a series of short broad segments. The divisions in the lower\r\nhalf of each segment mark the position of the sterile bracts, while\r\nthose of the upper half represent the outlines of the upper sporangia\r\nof each whorl of sporangiophores, the lower sporangia being hidden by\r\nthe ring of linear bracts[678]. On some portions of the specimen of\r\nfig. 89, _A_, it is possible to recognise the outlines of cells on\r\nthe coaly surface-film; these probably belong to the sporangium wall.\r\nThis type of cone is included under the genus _Calamostachys_, a name\r\napplied to Calamitean strobili with certain morphological characters,\r\nas described on p. 351.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _c. Roots._\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Williamson[679] described some sections of what he considered\r\nto be a distinct variety of a Calamite stem. The chief peculiarity\r\nwhich he noticed lay in the absence of carinal canals, and in the solid\r\npith. Some years later the same observer[680] came to the conclusion\r\nthat the specimens were probably those of a plant generically distinct\r\nfrom _Calamites_; he accordingly proposed a new name _Astromyelon_.\r\nSubsequently Cash and Hick[681] gave an account of some examples\r\nof apparently another form of plant, to which they gave the name\r\n_Myriophylloides Williamsonis_; and Williamson[682] suggested the term\r\n_Helophyton_ as a more suitable generic designation. It was, however,\r\ndemonstrated by Spencer[683] that the plant described by Cash and Hick\r\nwas identical with Williamson’s _Astromyelon_. Williamson[684] then\r\ngave an account of several specimens of this type illustrating various\r\nstages in the growth and development of the _Astromyelon_ ‘stems,’\r\nwhich he compared with the rhizome of the recent genus _Marsilia_.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 Renault[685] published an account of _Astromyelon_ in which he\r\nbrought forward good evidence in favour of regarding it as a Calamitean\r\nroot. The same author has recently given some excellent figures and\r\na detailed description of certain specific types of these Calamite\r\nroots, and Williamson and Scott’s memoir on the roots of _Calamites_\r\nhas rendered our knowledge of _Astromyelon_ almost complete. Some of\r\nthe finest specimens, in which the organic connection between typical\r\nCalamite stems and _Astromyelon_ roots is clearly demonstrated, are in\r\nthe Natural History Museum, Paris. There are several sections also from\r\nEnglish material which show the connection between root and stem very\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90. Pith-cast of a Calamite stem, with roots;\r\n  embedded in sandstone and shale. (After Grand’Eury.) Much reduced.]\r\n\r\nCasts of the hollow pith of Calamite rhizomes or aerial branches are\r\noccasionally found in which slender appendages are given off either\r\nsingly or in tufts from the nodal regions. Many examples of such\r\ncasts have been figured by Lindley and Hutton[686], Binney[687],\r\nGrand’Eury[688], Weiss[689], Stur, and other writers[690]. The large\r\nstem-cast of fig. 90 illustrates the manner of occurrence of long\r\nbranched roots on the nodes of a Calamite growing in sandy or clay\r\nsoil. The lower and more darkly shaded portion of the specimen is\r\ncovered by a layer of coal representing the carbonised wood and cortex,\r\nwhich has been moulded on to the sandstone pith-cast. In fig. 77 (p.\r\n316) a fairly thick root is seen, in organic connection with one of the\r\nnodes, _N_ 3, and on _N_ 2 there is a scar of another root.\r\n\r\nThere are certain external characters by which one may often recognise\r\na Calamitean root. There is no division into nodes and internodes as\r\nin stems, and as the pith of the root was usually solid the parallel\r\nribs and grooves of stem-casts are not present. In smaller flattened\r\nroots there may sometimes be seen a central or excentric black line\r\nrepresenting the stele, and the surface of the root presents a curious\r\nwrinkled or shagreen texture, probably due to the shrinkage of the\r\nloose lacunar cortex. The occasional excentric position of the stele is\r\nno doubt due to the displacement of the vascular cylinder as a result\r\nof the rapid decay of the cortical tissues. In the Bergakademie of\r\nBerlin there are some unusually good examples of Calamite casts bearing\r\nwell-preserved root-impressions; these include the original specimens\r\nfigured by Weiss[691].\r\n\r\nNo doubt some of the roots figured by various writers under the names\r\n_Pinnularia_[692] and _Hydatica_[693] belong to _Calamites_, but it is\r\noften impossible to identify detached specimens with any certainty.\r\n\r\nThe section figured diagrammatically in fig. 91 _A_ shows the\r\ncharacteristic single series of large lacunae, _l_, in the middle\r\ncortical region. In the centre there is a wide solid pith surrounded by\r\na ring of vascular tissue, _x_. The appearance of the middle cortex is\r\nvery like that of the stem of a water-plant such as _Myriophyllum_, the\r\nWater Milfoil; it shows that the Calamite roots grew either in water or\r\nswampy ground. In fig. 91 _B_, the root characters are clearly seen;\r\nthe centre of the stele is occupied by large parenchymatous cells which\r\nare rather longer than broad in longitudinal view; at the periphery\r\nthere are four protoxylem groups _px_, alternating with four groups\r\nof phloem, _ph_, the latter being situated a little further from the\r\ncentre of the stele. The structure is therefore that of a typical\r\ntetrarch root. In the example represented in the figure secondary\r\nthickening has begun, and the cambial cells internal to each phloem\r\ngroup have given rise to a few radially disposed tracheids, _x²_.\r\nBeyond the phloem there are two layers of parenchyma representing,\r\nas regards position, a pericycle and an endodermis. In the ordinary\r\npericycle and endodermis of the roots of most plants the cells of\r\nthe two layers are on alternate radii, but in the Calamite root, as\r\nin _Equisetum_ roots, the cells of these layers are placed on the\r\nsame radii, as seen in the neighbourhood of _x²_ in the figure. This\r\ncorrespondence of the radial walls of the endodermal and pericyclic\r\ncells points to the development of both layers from one mother-layer,\r\nand suggests the ‘double endodermis’ or phloeoterma of _Equisetum_\r\n(p. 254). The cells in the outer of these two layers have slight\r\nthickenings on the radial walls recalling the usual character of\r\nendodermal cells. The phloeoterma is succeeded by a few layers of\r\nparenchyma, constituting the inner cortex, and beyond this we have\r\nthe large lacunae separated from one another by slender trabeculae\r\nof cells. The outer cortex is limited by a well-defined layer of\r\nthick-walled cells, which may be spoken of as the _epidermoidal[694]\r\nlayer_. Roots possessing this superficial layer of thicker cells have\r\nno doubt lost the original surface-layer which produced the absorptive\r\nroot-hairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91. _A._ Diagrammatic sketch of a transverse\r\n  section of a young root of _Calamites_. _x_, xylem; _l_, lacuna.\r\n  After Hick.\r\n\r\n  _B._ Central cylinder (stele) of root, _px_, protoxylem; _ph_,\r\n  phloem; _x²_, secondary xylem; _l_, phloeoterma. × 75. After\r\n  Williamson and Scott.]\r\n\r\nThe xylem elements have the form of spiral, reticulate and scalariform\r\ntracheids.\r\n\r\nIn roots or rootlets smaller than that shown in fig. 91 _B_, the\r\nprimary xylem may extend to the centre of the stele, and form a\r\ncontinuous axial strand; in such examples the structure may be\r\ndiarch, triarch or tetrarch. The origin of the cambium agrees\r\nwith that in recent roots, the cells immediately external to the\r\nprotoxylem tracheids become meristematic, as also those internal to\r\nthe phloem. Another root-character is seen in the endogenous origin\r\nof lateral members. Good examples of branching roots are figured by\r\nWilliamson[695] and by Williamson and Scott[696].\r\n\r\nOlder roots[697] are usually found in a decorticated condition. A\r\ntransverse section of root in which secondary thickening has been\r\nactive for some time presents on a superficial view a close resemblance\r\nto a stem of _Calamites_, but a careful comparison at once reveals\r\nimportant points of difference. The specimen diagrammatically sketched\r\nin fig. 92 illustrates very clearly the origin of a root from the\r\nnode of a Calamite stem. The section has passed through a stem in a\r\ntangential direction, showing the characteristic arrangement of the\r\nvascular bundles _x_, and principal medullary rays _m_. The small\r\nleaf-traces, _t_, _t_, afford another feature characteristic of a\r\nCalamite stem. The portion of stem to the right of the figure has been\r\nslightly displaced, and between this piece and the root _R_, one of\r\nthe ubiquitous Stigmarian appendages, _s_, has inserted itself. At _R_\r\na fairly thick and decorticated root is seen in oblique transverse\r\nsection; at the upper end the root tracheids are seen in direct\r\ncontinuity with the xylem of the stem. In the centre of the root\r\nis the large solid pith surrounded by twelve bluntly pointed xylem\r\ngroups, composed in the main of radially disposed scalariform elements\r\nwith narrow secondary medullary rays like those in a stem. Between\r\neach xylem group there is a broad medullary ray, which tapers rapidly\r\ntowards the outside, and is soon obliterated by the formation of\r\ninterfascicular secondary xylem. At _R′_ a portion of another root is\r\nseen in transverse section, and _R″_ the inner part of a single xylem\r\ngroup is shown more clearly. The solid pith and the absence of carinal\r\ncanals are the two most obvious distinguishing features of the roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92. Tangential section through a node of\r\n  _Calamites_, showing a root in organic connection with the stem.\r\n\r\n  _R_, _R′_.

Sketched from a section in the Cambridge\r\n      Botanical Laboratory Collection.]\r\n\r\nAs Renault points out, roots of _Calamites_ have been figured by some\r\nwriters[698] as examples of stems, but it is usually comparatively\r\neasy to distinguish between roots and stems. On examining the xylem\r\ngroups more closely, one notices that the apex of each is occupied by\r\na triangular group of centripetally-developed primary tracheids, the\r\nnarrow spiral protoxylem elements occupying the outwardly directed\r\napex. The protoxylem apex is usually followed externally by a ray of\r\none or two radially disposed series of parenchymatous cells. This ray\r\nis not distinguished in fig. 92 _R″_ from the rows of xylem tracheids.\r\nEach xylem group is thus formed partly of centripetal xylem and in part\r\nof secondary centrifugal xylem; the latter is associated with secondary\r\nmedullary rays, as in stems, and contains a broader ray (_fascicular\r\nray_ of Williamson and Scott[699]) immediately opposite each\r\nprotoxylem strand. In the roots of recent plants (_e.g._ _Cucurbita_,\r\n_Phaseolus_, &c.) a broad medullary ray is often found opposite the\r\nprotoxylem, and such an arrangement is a perfectly normal structure in\r\nroots[700].\r\n\r\nRenault has recently described several species of Calamite roots which\r\nhe designates by specific names, some of them belonging to stems with\r\nthe _Arthropitys_ structure, and others to _Calamodendron_. Some of\r\nthe roots figured by the French author have an axial strand of xylem\r\nwith 7–15 projecting angles of protoxylem[701]. These he considers\r\ntrue roots, but the larger specimens with a wide pith he prefers to\r\nregard as stolons. In the latter he mentions the union of the primary\r\ncentripetal with the secondary centrifugal wood as a distinguishing\r\nfeature. It has been shown, however, that each group of secondary xylem\r\nincludes a median ray of parenchyma, and that the whole structure is\r\nessentially that of a root, and not that of a modified stem or stolon.\r\nThe organs described by Renault as true roots are probably rootlets,\r\nand as Williamson and Scott have demonstrated, there is every gradation\r\nbetween the smaller specimens with a solid xylem axis and those with a\r\nlarge central pith.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Renault’s figures of _Calamodendron_\r\nroots show the closest resemblance to those of the subgenus\r\n_Arthropitys_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _d. Cones._\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of fossil plants in the form of isolated fragments is a\r\nconstant source of difficulty, and is well illustrated by the numerous\r\nexamples of strobili which cannot be connected with their parent\r\nstems. We are, however, usually able to recognise Calamitean cones\r\nif the impressions or petrified specimens are fairly well preserved,\r\nbut it is seldom possible to correlate particular types of cones with\r\nthe corresponding species of foliage-shoots or stems. Palaeobotanical\r\nliterature contains numerous illustrations and descriptions of\r\nlong and narrow strobili designated by different generic terms such\r\nas _Volkmannia_, _Brukmannia_, _Calamostachys_, _Macrostachya_ and\r\nothers; many of these have since been recognised as the cones of\r\n_Calamites_, while some species of _Volkmannia_ have been identified\r\nwith _Sphenophyllum_ stems. Before further considering the general\r\nquestion of Calamite cones, a few examples may be described in detail\r\nas types of fructification which are known to have been borne by\r\n_Calamites_. The examples selected are species of the two provisional\r\ngenera _Calamostachys_ and _Palaeostachya_.\r\n\r\nThe usual form of a Calamite cone is illustrated in fig. 93, which\r\nrepresents a fertile shoot bearing a few narrow linear leaves of the\r\n_Calamocladus_ type; in the axils of some of these are borne the long\r\nstrobili.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93. _Calamostachys_ sp.

Figs. 94 and 95.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Carruthers[702] gave an account of the structural features\r\nof the species of cones named by him _Volkmannia Ludwigi_ and\r\n_V. Binneyi_, the generic term having been originally used by\r\nSternberg[703] for some impressions of Carboniferous strobili.\r\nBrongniart[704] in 1849 referred to the various forms of _Volkmannia_\r\nas cones of Asterophyllitean branches, and the latter he regarded\r\nas the foliage-shoots of a Calamite stem. In 1868 Binney[705]\r\npublished a description, with several illustrations, of the cones\r\nnamed by Carruthers _Volkmannia Binneyi_, and referred to them\r\nas the fructification of that type of Calamite stem spoken of\r\nin a previous section of this chapter (p. 311) as _Calamites_\r\n(_Arthropitys_) _communis_ (Binney). This cone is now usually spoken\r\nof as _Calamostachys Binneyana_; the specific name _Binneyana_\r\nbeing suggested by Schimper[706] in 1869 as more euphonious than\r\nthat proposed by Carruthers. In recent years our knowledge of both\r\n_C. Binneyana_ and _C. Ludwigi_ has been considerably extended. We\r\nshall confine our attention in the following account to the former\r\nspecies[707]. Some excellent figures of the latter species may be found\r\nin Weiss’ Memoir[708] on Calamarieae.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest examples of _Calamostachys Binneyana_ so far\r\nrecorded has a length of 3–4 cm. and a maximum diameter of about 7·5\r\nmm. The axis of the cone bears whorls of sterile leaves or bracts at\r\nequal distances; the linear bracts of each whorl are coherent basally\r\nas a disc or plate of tissue attached at right angles to the central\r\naxis of the cone. The periphery of each of these discs divides up into\r\ntwelve linear segments, which curve upwards in a direction more or less\r\nparallel to the strobilus axis, and at right angles to the coherent\r\nportion of each whorl. The manner of occurrence of the whorls is\r\nshown in fig. 94, which has been sketched from a large section in the\r\nWilliamson collection. The segments of the successive sterile verticils\r\nalternate with one another, so that in the surface-view of a cone the\r\nlong and narrow free bracts appear spirally disposed. Midway between\r\nthese alternating sterile verticils there is a series of fertile\r\nappendages, also given off in regular whorls. Each fertile whorl\r\nconsists of about half as many members as the segments of a sterile\r\nwhorl, and the members of the several fertile whorls are superposed and\r\nnot alternate. Each member has the form of a stalk or sporangiophore\r\ngiven off at right angles from the cone axis; this is expanded distally\r\ninto a peltate disc bearing four sporangia attached to its inner face.\r\nIn fig. 94 we can only see the basal portions of the sporangiophores,\r\nwhich are shown in the upper part of the sketch as pointed projections,\r\n_Sp_, from the cone axis. Each sporangiophore is traversed by a\r\nvascular strand which sends off a branch to the base of a sporangium\r\n(fig. 95, A, _t_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94. _Calamostachys Binneyana_ (Carr.) in\r\n  longitudinal (radial and tangential) section.\r\n\r\n  _Sp_, sporangiophores; _S_, sporangia.\r\n    (From specimen no. 1022 in the Williamson Collection, British\r\n    Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe axis of the cone is occupied by a single stele, usually triangular\r\nin section; the stele consists of a solid pith of elongated cells\r\nsurrounded by six vascular bundles, two at each corner. A somewhat\r\nirregular gap marks the position of the protoxylem of each strand,\r\nand portions of spiral or annular tracheids may occasionally be\r\nseen in the cavity. These cavities, which may be spoken of as the\r\ncarinal canals, disappear at the nodes, where there is a mass of\r\nshort reticulately pitted tracheids, as in a Calamite stem. Vascular\r\nbundles pass upwards in an oblique direction from the central stele\r\nto supply the bracts, each of which is traversed by a single strand\r\nof tracheids. The coherent portion, or disc, of each sterile whorl\r\nconsists of sclerenchymatous elements towards the upper surface, and\r\nof parenchyma below. The pedicel of the sporangiophores consists of\r\nfairly thick-walled cells traversed by a single vascular strand,\r\nand the peltate distal portions are made up of parenchymatous cells\r\narranged in a palisade-like form at right angles to the free surface\r\nof the sporangiophores. The vascular strand of the pedicel forks into\r\ntwo halves just below the peltate head, and these branches again\r\nbifurcate to send a branch to each sporangium. The four sporangia of\r\neach sporangiophore are attached by a narrow band of tissue to the\r\nshield-shaped distal expansion (fig. 95, A).\r\n\r\nIn a tangential section of a cone, such as the lower portion of fig. 94\r\nand in fig. 95, B, the sporangiophores present the appearance of narrow\r\nstalks (fig. 95, B, _a_) in the middle of a cluster of sporangia,\r\nand the latter appear more or less square in outline. The wall of a\r\nsporangium is made of a single layer of cells (fig. 95, B) which\r\npresent a characteristic appearance in surface-view (fig. 95, C), the\r\nthin walls being crossed at right angles by small vertical plates. In\r\nthe tangential section of the coherent sterile whorls (fig. 95, B,\r\n_b_ and _b_) the vascular strands are occasionally seen in transverse\r\nsection (fig. 95, B, _t_), as they pass outwards to the several free\r\nbracts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95. _Calamostachys Binneyana_ (Carr.).\r\n\r\n  _A._ A sporangiophore and one sporangium. _t_, vascular bundle. × 45.\r\n  _B._ Tangential section showing portions of two sterile discs, _b_,\r\n      _b_; a sporangiophore, _a_, with its four sporangia, in two of\r\n      which are seen the spores; _t_, vascular bundle. × 35.\r\n  _C._ Surface-view of cells of a sporangium wall. × 130.\r\n  _D._ Spores and remains of mother-cells. × 130.\r\n\r\n    (After Williamson and Scott.)]\r\n\r\nThe spores in _Calamostachys Binneyana_ are all of the same size,\r\nand no macrospores have ever been seen. In well preserved specimens\r\ntetrads of spores may be seen, still enclosed by the wall of the\r\nspore-mother-cell (fig. 95, A and D); and the torn remnants of\r\nthe mother-cell sometimes simulate in appearance the elaters of\r\nan _Equisetum_ spore. In surface-view a spore often shows clearly\r\nthe three-rayed marking, which is a characteristic feature of\r\ndaughter-cells formed in a tetrad from a mother-cell. The spores of\r\na tetrad are in some cases of unequal size, some having developed\r\nmore vigorously than others. This unequal growth and nourishment of\r\nspores is clearly shown in fig. 96, which represents a sporangium\r\nof a heterosporous Calamitean strobilus, _C. Casheana_. Williamson\r\nand Scott[709] have described striking examples of spores in\r\ndifferent stages of abortion, and these authors draw attention to\r\nthe importance of the phenomenon from the point of view of the\r\norigin of a heterosporous form of cone. The abortion of some of the\r\nmembers of a spore-tetrad and the consequent increased nutrition of\r\nthe more favoured daughter-cells, might well be the starting-point\r\nof a process, which would ultimately lead to the production of well\r\ndefined macrospores and microspores. The young microsporangia and\r\nmacrosporangia of recent Vascular Cryptogams such as _Selaginella_,\r\n_Salvinia_ and other heterosporous genera are identical in\r\nappearance[710]; it is not until the spore-producing tissue begins to\r\ndifferentiate into groups of spores, that the sporangia assume the\r\nform of macrosporangia and microsporangia. During the evolution of\r\nthe various known types of pteridophytic plants heterospory gradually\r\nsucceeded isospory, and this no doubt occurred several times and in\r\ndifferent phyla of the plant kingdom. In the mature sporangia of some\r\nof the Calamitean strobili we have in the inequality of the spores in\r\none sporangium an indication of the steps by which heterospory arose;\r\nand in the immature sporangia of some recent genera we are carried back\r\nto a stage still nearer the starting-point of the substitution of the\r\nheterosporous for the isosporous condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Calamostachys Casheana_ Will. Fig. 96.\r\n\r\nTo Williamson[711] again is largely due the information we possess as\r\nto the structure of this type of Calamitean strobilus. Its special\r\ninterest lies in the occurrence of macrospores and microspores in the\r\nsame cone.\r\n\r\nThe strobilus axis agrees in structure with that of _C. Binneyana_,\r\nbut in _C. Casheana_ a band of secondary xylem forms the peripheral\r\nportion of the triangular stele. Were any further proof needed of the\r\nnow well-established fact that secondary growth in thickness is by no\r\nmeans unknown as an attribute of Vascular Cryptogams, the co-existence\r\nin the same cone of a cambium layer producing secondary wood and\r\nbark, and cryptogamic macrospores and microspores, affords conclusive\r\nevidence[712]. The dogma accepted by many writers for a considerable\r\nnumber of years that the power of secondary thickening is evidence\r\nagainst a cryptogamic affinity, has been responsible for no little\r\nconfusion in palaeobotanical nomenclature.\r\n\r\nOn the axis of _Calamostachys Casheana_ there are borne alternate\r\nwhorls of fertile and sterile appendages similar to those in the\r\nhomosporous _C. Binneyana_, but they are inclined more obliquely to\r\nthe axis of the cone. Macrospores and microspores have been found in\r\nsporangia borne on the same sporangiophore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96. _Calamostachys Casheana_ Will.\r\n\r\n  A sporangium with macrospores and abortive spores. × 65.\r\n\r\n  (After Williamson and Scott.)]\r\n\r\nThe spore-tetrads in the macrosporangia occasionally include aborted\r\nsister-cells like those noticed in _C. Binneyana_; this phenomenon\r\nis well illustrated by the unequally nourished spores in the\r\nsporangium of fig. 96, but no such starved spores have been found\r\nin the microsporangia. In this cone, then, heterospory has become\r\nfirmly established, but the occurrence of undersized spores in a\r\nmacrospore-tetrad leads us back to the probable lines of development of\r\nheterospory, which are seen in _C. Binneyana_ at their starting-point.\r\n\r\nIn the two species of strobili which have been described,\r\n_Calamostachys Binneyana_ and _C. Casheana_, the sporangiophores or\r\nsporophylls are given off at right angles to the axis, and midway\r\nbetween the sterile whorls. These are two of the most important\r\ndistinguishing features of the Calamitean cones included under the\r\ngeneric term _Calamostachys_. In another form of cone, which also\r\nbelongs to Calamitean stems, the sporangiophores arise in the axil\r\nof the sterile leaves, and are inclined obliquely to the axis of the\r\ncone. To this type the generic name _Palaeostachya_ has been applied\r\nby the late Prof. Weiss[713] of Berlin. The portion of a cone shown in\r\nfig. 97 shows the arrangement of the sterile and fertile appendages\r\ncharacteristic of _Palaeostachya_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97. _Palaeostachya pedunculata_ Will. Part of a\r\n  cone, × 3. (After Weiss.)]\r\n\r\nIt is practically impossible to distinguish between cones of the\r\n_Calamostachys_ and _Palaeostachya_ type in the case of imperfectly\r\npreserved impressions; indeed we cannot assume that all long and narrow\r\ncones with spirally disposed verticillate bracts are Calamitean. We\r\nmust have the additional evidence of internal structure or of the\r\ndirect association of the cones with Calamitean foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Palaeostachya vera_ sp. nov. Fig. 98.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Williamson[714] described a fragment of a strobilus which\r\nshowed certain anatomical features indicative of a close relationship\r\nor even identity with _Calamites_. Some years later[715] a much more\r\nperfect example was obtained from the Coal-Measures of Lancashire,\r\nand the additional evidence which it afforded definitely confirmed\r\nthe earlier views of Williamson. The cone was more fully described by\r\nWilliamson in 1888, as “the true fruit of _Calamites_.” It is clearly a\r\nform of Weiss’ genus _Palaeostachya_; Williamson and Scott[716] refer\r\nto it in their Memoir as _Calamites pedunculatus_. It is preferable,\r\nhowever, to retain the generic designation _Palaeostachya_ for cones\r\nof this type. As the name _P. pedunculata_ has previously been adopted\r\nby Weiss[717] for a cone figured by Williamson[718] in 1874, and\r\nafterwards referred to by that author in writing as _P. pedunculata_,\r\nit is proposed to substitute the specific name _vera_; this specific\r\nname being chosen with a view to put on record the fact that it was\r\nthis type of cone that Williamson first proved to be the _true_\r\nfructification of the Calamite.\r\n\r\nThe axis of _P. vera_ is practically identical in structure with a\r\nCalamitean twig. There is a hollow pith in the centre of the stele\r\nsurrounded by a ring of 16–20 collateral bundles, each of which is\r\naccompanied by a carinal canal as in a vegetative shoot. As the\r\npedicel of the strobilus passes into the cone proper it undergoes some\r\nmodification in structure, but retains the characteristic features of\r\na Calamite. The diagrammatic longitudinal section of fig. 98, which is\r\ncopied from a drawing by Williamson[719], shows the broadening of the\r\nvascular strands at the nodes, and here and there a carinal canal is\r\nseen internal to the wood.\r\n\r\nThe axis of the cone bears whorls of bracts at right angles to the\r\ncentral column. Each whorl consists of about 30–40 segments coherent\r\nbasally into a disc of prosenchymatous and parenchymatous tissue.\r\nThe free linear bracts curve sharply upwards from the periphery of\r\nthe disc, approximately parallel to the axis of the cone. From each\r\nof these sterile whorls there are given off 16–20 long and slender\r\nobliquely-inclined sporangiophores, _sp_, which arise from the upper\r\nsurface of the disc close to the axis. Each sporangiophore no doubt\r\nbore four sporangia, _S_, containing spores of one size,—about ·075\r\nmm. in diameter. The specimens of _Palaeostachya vera_ so far obtained\r\ndo not show the actual manner of attachment of the sporangia, but more\r\ncomplete examples of other species of _Palaeostachya_[720] enable us to\r\nassume with certainty that the sporangiophores terminated in a distal\r\npeltate expansion bearing four sporangia on its inner face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98. Diagrammatic longitudinal section of\r\n  _Palaeostachya vera_, sp. nov. _S_, _S_, _S_, sporangia; _x_,\r\n  xylem; _sp_, sporangiophore. (After Williamson.)]\r\n\r\nA transverse section of the axis of the cone in the region of the\r\nsterile and fertile appendages shows the vascular bundles arranged\r\nin pairs. In a section through the peduncle of the cone, below the\r\nlowest whorl of bracts, the bundles of the stele are situated at equal\r\ndistances apart. The cortical tissue of the peduncle is traversed by\r\na ring of large canals[721] similar to the vallecular canals of an\r\nEquisetum stem.\r\n\r\nIsospory is not a constant characteristic of _Palaeostachya_; some\r\nforms have been found with macrospores and microspores[722].\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Other Calamitean cones, and examples illustrating the\r\n           connection between Cones and Vegetative Shoots._\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place in an introduction to Palaeobotany to attempt\r\nan exhaustive account of the various cones which were probably borne\r\nby Calamitean plants, but there are a few general points to which the\r\nattention of the student should be directed. The examples dealt with\r\nin the foregoing description illustrate the fact, that plants included\r\nunder the comprehensive genus _Calamites_ bore cones possessing\r\ndistinct morphological features. There are, however, other types of\r\nstrobili which have been found in organic connection with _Calamites_;\r\nand some of these must be taken into account in dealing with\r\nCalamarian plants. The genera _Volkmannia_, _Brukmannia_, _Huttonia_,\r\n_Macrostachya_, in addition to _Calamostachys_ and _Palaeostachya_ and\r\nothers, have been applied by different writers to Calamitean cones. As\r\nSolms-Laubach[723] has suggested, it is wiser to discard _Volkmannia_\r\nand _Brukmannia_, as they have been made to do duty for cones of widely\r\ndifferent forms. It is better to adhere to the provisional generic\r\nnames used by Weiss, as they enable us to conveniently systematise the\r\nvarious Calamarian strobili.\r\n\r\nThe following classification may be given of the better known cones,\r\nsome of which we are able to describe in considerable detail, while\r\nothers are still very imperfectly known. We have good evidence that\r\nall these strobili were borne by vegetative shoots of the type of\r\n_Calamites_, _Calamocladus_ or _Annularia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n      1. _Calamostachys_[724] (including _Paracalamostachys_ and\r\n                          _Stachannularia_).\r\n\r\nCones long and narrow, consisting of a central axis bearing alternate\r\nwhorls of sterile and fertile appendages, the latter having the form of\r\nsporangiophores attached at right angles to the axis midway between the\r\nsterile verticils, and bearing four sporangia on the inner face of a\r\npeltate distal expansion.\r\n\r\n_Calamostachys Binneyana_ Schimp., _C. Ludwigi_ Carr., _C. Casheana_\r\nWill., may be referred to as examples of this type of cone; also\r\nsome of the strobili described by different authors as species of\r\n_Volkmannia_[725], _Brukmannia_[726], &c.\r\n\r\nAlthough one cannot make out the detailed structure of a Calamite cone\r\nin the absence of internal structure, it is often possible to recognise\r\nthe essential features in specimens preserved in ironstone nodules,\r\nsuch as those from Coalbrook Dale in Shropshire, or by carefully\r\nexamining the carbonised impressions on shale under a simple microscope.\r\n\r\nWeiss applies the term _Paracalamostachys_[727] to cones of the\r\n_Calamostachys_ form, but in which the manner of attachment cannot be\r\nmade out. Such a cone as that of fig. 93 should probably be referred to\r\nthis sub-type of _Calamostachys_ in the absence of definite evidence as\r\nto the position of the sporangia.\r\n\r\nAnother term _Stachannularia_, originally used by Weiss as a\r\ngenus[728], was afterwards[729] applied to cones of the same general\r\ntype as _Calamostachys_, in which the sporangiophores have the form of\r\nthorn-like structures bearing on their upper side a lamellar expansion.\r\nThere is however some doubt as to the correct interpretation of the\r\nfeatures associated with cones included in _Stachannularia_; for an\r\naccount of such forms reference must be made to the writings of Weiss,\r\nRenault[730], Solms-Laubach[731] and others[732].\r\n\r\n_Calamostachys_ cones have been found in organic union with branches\r\nbearing leaves of the _Annularia_ type, also with _Calamocladus_\r\nfoliage, and the branches bearing such cones have been found in\r\nactual connection with Calamitean stems. The association of cones and\r\nvegetative stems and branches is shown in tabular form on p. 363.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2. _Palaeostachya[733]._\r\n\r\nIn this genus the general habit agrees with that of _Calamostachys_,\r\nand in imperfectly preserved specimens it may be impossible to\r\ndiscriminate between _Calamostachys_ and _Palaeostachya_. The latter\r\nform is characterised by the attachment of the sporangiophores in the\r\naxil of the sterile bracts, or immediately above them, as shown in\r\nfigs. 97 and 98.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. _Palaeostachya vera_ sp. nov., _P. pedunculata_ Will. afford\r\nexamples of this form of strobilus. The genus _Palaeostachya_ includes\r\nseveral species previously described under the genus _Volkmannia_[734].\r\n\r\nStrobili of this generic type are known in organic association with\r\nAnnularian branches, as well as with _Calamocladus_ and _Calamites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          3. _Macrostachya._\r\n\r\nThis generic name was originally applied by Schimper[735] to certain\r\nforms of Calamitean stems, of the type afterwards referred to the\r\nsub-genus _Calamitina_ by Weiss, bearing long and thick cones. The name\r\nis, however, more appropriately restricted to strobili, which differ\r\nfrom the two preceding genera in their greater length (14–16 cm.) and\r\nin the more crowded and imbricating whorls of bracts. The internodes of\r\nthe cones are very short, and each whorl of bracts consists of about\r\n20 coherent members separated at the periphery of the disc into short\r\npointed teeth. The internal structure of _Macrostachya_ has not been\r\nsatisfactorily determined.

The student must refer to Weiss[748],\r\nSolms-Laubach[749] and other writers[750] for a further account of\r\nthese types, and of another rare and little-known form of cone, called\r\nby Weiss Cingularia[751].\r\n\r\nMacrostachyan cones have been found attached to stems of _Calamites_\r\nwhich are included in the sub-genus _Calamitina_ (p. 367). The larger\r\nsize of _Macrostachya_ as a distinguishing feature is not always a\r\nsafe test; some cones which belong to _Palaeostachya_ [_e.g._ _P.\r\narborescens_ Sternb.] and _Calamostachys_ (_e.g._ _C. Solmsi_) are much\r\nthicker and larger than the majority of species of these two genera.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the examples selected to illustrate the\r\nconnection between strobili and vegetative shoots, that the\r\n_Annularia_ type of branch usually bears cones which conform to the\r\ngenus _Calamostachys_ (_Stachannularia_); while the Asterophyllitean\r\nbranches—_Calamocladus_—are associated with _Palaeostachya_ and\r\n_Macrostachya_. But this rule is not constant, and we are not in\r\na position to speak of cones of a particular type as necessarily\r\ncharacteristic of definite types of Calamitean shoots.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nAlthough it is admitted by the great majority of Palaeobotanists that\r\nthe Calamites were all true Vascular Cryptogams, the older view that\r\nsome members of the Calamarieae are gymnospermous has not been given up\r\nby Renault[752]. This observer has recently described some seeds which\r\nhe believes were borne by Calamitean stems; he admits, however, that\r\nno undoubted female cones of _Calamodendron_ have so far been found.\r\nIn view of the unsatisfactory evidence on which Renault’s opinion is\r\nbased, we need not further discuss the questions which he raises.\r\n\r\n  [The following specimens in the Williamson Cabinet in the British\r\n  Museum, may be found useful in illustration of the structure of\r\n  _Calamites_.\r\n\r\n  _Stems._ (i. _Arthropitys._) _Young twigs and small branches_ 1, 2,\r\n      6, 10, 14, 19, 116*, 1002, 1007, 1020.\r\n\r\n      _Older stems_ (_transverse sections_) 15–17, 62, 77–87, 115 _a_,\r\n          117*, 118*, 120, 122*–124*, 1933 A, 1934, 1941.\r\n\r\n      (_Tangential sections_) 20, 24, 26, 37, 38, 49, 90, 91, 130, 138,\r\n          1937, 1943.\r\n\r\n      (_Radial sections_) 20, 20 A, 21, 22, 48, 65–68, 83–91, 137*,\r\n          138*, 1937.\r\n\r\n    (ii. _Arthrodendron)_ 36, 37, 38, 52, 54.\r\n\r\n  _Roots._ 1335, 1347, 1350, 1356.\r\n\r\n  _Strobili._ i. _Calamostachys Binneyana._ 991, 996, 997, 1000, 1003,\r\n      1005, 1007, 1008, 1011, 1013, 1016, 1017, 1022, 1023, 1037 A,\r\n      1043.\r\n\r\n    ii. _C.

Pith-casts of Calamites.\r\n\r\n        A. _Calamitina._ B. _Stylocalamites._ C. _Eucalamites._\r\n\r\nPalaeobotanical literature contains a large number of species of\r\n_Calamites_ founded on pith-casts alone. Many of these so-called\r\nspecies are of little or no value botanically, but while we may admit\r\nthe futility of attempting to recognise specific types in the same\r\nsense as in the determination of recent plants, it is necessary to\r\npay attention to such characters as are likely to prove of value for\r\ndescriptive and comparative purposes. From the nature of the specimens\r\nit is clear that many of the differences may be such as are likely to\r\nbe met with in different branches of the same species, while in others\r\nthe pith-casts of distinct species or genera may be almost identical.\r\n\r\nThe most striking differences observable in Calamite casts are in the\r\ncharacter of the internodes, the infranodal canals, the number and\r\ndisposition of branch-scars, and other surface features. Occasionally\r\nit is possible to recognise certain anatomical characters in the coaly\r\nlayer which often surrounds a shale- or sandstone-cast, and the surface\r\nof a well preserved cast may give a clue to the nature of the wood in\r\nthe faint outlines of cells which can sometimes be detected on the cast\r\nitself[753]. The breadth of the carbonaceous envelope on a cast has\r\nbeen frequently relied on by some writers as an important character. It\r\nhas been suggested[754] that we may arrive at the original thickness\r\nof the wood of a stem by measuring the coaly layer and multiplying\r\nthe breadth by 27; the explanation being that a zone of wood 27 mm. in\r\nthickness is reduced in the process of carbonisation to a layer 1 mm.\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the coal on the same form of cast may vary considerably;\r\non this account, and for various other reasons, such a character can\r\nhave but little value. Our knowledge of anatomy may often help us\r\nto interpret certain features of internal casts and to appreciate\r\napparently unimportant details. One occasionally notices that a\r\nCalamite pith-cast has large infranodal canals, and in some specimens\r\neach internodal ridge may be traversed by a narrow median line or small\r\ngroove; large infranodal canal casts suggest the type of stem referred\r\nto the subgenus _Arthrodendron_, and the median line on the ridges may\r\nbe due to bands of hard tissue in each principal medullary ray.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to identify pith-casts the student must keep in view\r\nthe probable differences presented by the branching rhizome, the main\r\naerial branches and the finer shoots of the same individual. The long\r\ninternodal ridges of some casts may be mistaken for the parallel veins\r\nof such a leaf as _Cordaites_, a Palaeozoic Gymnosperm, if there are\r\nno nodes visible on the specimen. The fossil figured by Lindley and\r\nHutton[755] as _Poacites_, and regarded by them as a Monocotyledon,\r\nis no doubt a portion of a Calamite with very long internodes. An\r\ninteresting example of incorrect determination has recently been\r\npointed out by Nathorst[756] in the case of certain casts from Bear\r\nIsland, originally described by Heer as examples of _Calamites_; the\r\nvertical rows of leaf-trace casts on a _Knorria_ were mistaken for the\r\nribs of a Calamite stem. The specimens in the Stockholm Museum fully\r\nbear out Nathorst’s interpretation. The undulating course of internodal\r\nridges and grooves is not in itself a character of specific value. If\r\na Calamite stem were bent slightly, the wood and medullary-ray tissues\r\non the concave side might adapt themselves to the shortening of the\r\nstem by becoming more or less folded, and a cast of such a stem would\r\nshow undulating ridges and grooves on one side and straight ones on the\r\nother[757].\r\n\r\nA convenient classification of Calamite casts was proposed by Weiss\r\nin 1884, founded chiefly on the number and manner of occurrence of\r\nbranch-scars—or rather branch-depressions—on the surface of pith-casts.\r\nWeiss[758] recognised the imperfection of his proposed grouping,\r\nand Zeiller[759] has also expressed reasonable doubts as to the\r\nscientific value of such group-characters. Weiss instituted three\r\nsubgenera—_Calamitina_, _Eucalamites_ and _Stylocalamites_, which are\r\nmade use of as convenient terms in descriptive treatment of Calamite\r\ncasts. The following account of a few of the more typical casts may\r\nserve to illustrate the methods employed in the description of such\r\nspecimens; the synonomy given for the different species is not intended\r\nto be complete, but it is added with a view to drawing attention to the\r\nnecessity for careful comparison in systematic work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A. _Calamitina._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99. _Calamites_ (_Calamitina_) _Göpperti_ (Ett.).\r\n  _b_, branch scars.\r\n\r\n  From a specimen in the Manchester Museum, Owens College. ¼ nat.\r\n  size.]\r\n\r\nThis sub-genus of _Calamites_, as instituted by Weiss[760], includes\r\nCalamitean stems or branches, which are characterised by the periodic\r\noccurrence of branch-whorls usually represented by fairly large oval\r\nor circular scars just above a nodal line (figs. 99, 100 and 101).\r\nThe branch-scars may form a row of contiguous discs, or a whorl may\r\nconsist of a smaller number of branches which are not in contact\r\nbasally. A form described by Weiss as _C. pauciramis_, Weiss[761],\r\nhas only one branch in each whorl, as represented by a single large\r\noval scar on some of the nodes of the cast. A stem of this form is by\r\nno means a typical _Calamitina_, but it serves to show the existence\r\nof forms connecting Weiss’ sub-genera _Calamitina_ and _Eucalamites_.\r\nThe number of internodes and nodes between the branch whorls varies\r\nin different specimens, and is indeed not constant in the same\r\nplant. Each nodal line bears numerous elliptical scars which mark\r\nthe points of attachment of leaves; each branch-whorl is situated\r\nimmediately above a node, and in some forms this nodal line pursues\r\na somewhat irregular course across the stem, following the outlines\r\nof the several branch-scars[762]. The surface of the internodes is\r\neither perfectly smooth or it is more frequently traversed by short\r\nlongitudinal ridges or grooves probably representing fissures in the\r\nbark of the living stem; these are indicated by lines in fig. 99 and\r\nby elongated elliptical ridges in fig. 101. On young stems the leaves\r\nare occasionally found in place, as for example in an example figured\r\nby Weiss[763] (_C. Göpperti_), or we may have leaf-verticils still in\r\nplace in much older and thicker branches[764] (cf. fig. 85, p. 330).\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that the bark of _Calamitina_ stems has been\r\npreserved as a detached shell[765] reminding one of the sheets of Birch\r\nbark often met with in forests, the separation being no doubt due in\r\nthe fossil as in the recent trees to the manner of occurrence of the\r\ncork-cambium.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases branches have been preserved still attached to a stem\r\nor branch of higher order; examples of such specimens are figured\r\nby Lindley and Hutton[766], Stur[767], and others. Grand’Eury[768]\r\nhas given an idealised drawing of a typical _Calamitina_ bearing a\r\nwhorl of branches with the foliage and habit of _Asterophyllites\r\nequisetiformis_. The specimen on which this drawing is based is in the\r\nNatural History Museum, Paris; it shows Asterophyllitean branches in\r\norganic connection with a Calamitean stem, but it is not quite clear if\r\nthe stem is a true _Calamitina_. A large drawing of this interesting\r\nspecimen is given by Stur[769] in his monograph on _Calamites_, also\r\na smaller sketch by Renault[770] in his _Cours de botanique fossile_.\r\nSimilar branches of the _Asterophyllites_ type attached to an undoubted\r\n_Calamitina_ are figured also by Lindley and Hutton. There is, in\r\nshort, good evidence that stems of this sub-genus bore branches with\r\nAsterophyllitean shoots.\r\n\r\nThe wood of stems of the Calamitina group of _Calamites_, in some\r\ninstances at least, was of the _Arthropitys_ type; this has been\r\nshown to be the case in some French specimens from the Commentry\r\ncoal-field[771] and in others described by Stur[772]. The pith-casts\r\nof _Calamitina_ are characterised by comparatively short internodes\r\nseparated by deep nodal constrictions, as shown in fig. 100. From\r\nPermian specimens from Neu Paka in Bohemia, described by Stur[773], we\r\nlearn that there were the usual Calamite diaphragms bridging across\r\nthe wide pith-cavity at each node. Such a cast as that shown in fig.\r\n100 is often referred to as _Calamites approximatus_ Brongn.; the\r\nlength of the internodes and the periodic occurrence of branch-scars\r\nin the form of circular or oval depressions along a nodal line\r\nenable us to recognise the _Calamitina_ casts. Weiss[774] points out\r\nthat in pith-casts of this form the branch-scars occur on the nodal\r\nconstriction, and not immediately above the node as is the case on\r\nthe surface of a typical _Calamitina_. This distinction is however\r\nof little or no value; the point of attachment of a branch may be\r\nabove the nodal line, while on the pith-cast of the same stem the\r\npoint of origin of the vascular bundles of the branch is on the nodal\r\nconstriction[775].\r\n\r\nThe specimen shown in fig. 100 illustrates the appearance of a\r\n_Calamitina_ cast. There is a verticil of branch-scars on the lowest\r\nnodal constriction; on the right of the pith-cast the broad band of\r\nwood is faintly indicated by the smooth surface of the rock (_x_).\r\nOther examples demonstrating the existence of a broad woody cylinder in\r\n_Calamitina_ stems have been figured by Weiss[776] and other writers,\r\nand some good examples may be seen in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100. _Calamites_ (_Calamitina_) _approximatus_\r\n  Brongn. Lower Coal-Measures of Ayrshire.\r\n\r\n  _x_, impression of the wood.\r\n      (From a specimen in the collection of Mr R. Kidston.)]\r\n\r\nWe have so far noticed the connection of certain forms of pith-casts\r\n(_e.g._ _Calamites approximatus_), and Asterophyllitean shoots with\r\nstems of the sub-genus _Calamitina_.\r\n\r\nAs regards the strobili our knowledge is far from satisfactory.\r\nStur[777] figures some fertile branches bearing long and narrow\r\nstrobili, either _Palaeostachya_ or _Calamostachys_, in close\r\nassociation with _Calamitina_ stems, and Renault and Zeiller[778] give\r\nillustrations of the association of _Calamitina_ stems with large\r\nstrobili of the _Macrostachya_ form.\r\n\r\nBefore Weiss proposed the term _Calamitina_, various authors had\r\nfigured this form of Calamite under a distinct generic name (_e.g._\r\n_Hippurites_ of Lindley and Hutton[779], _Cyclocladia_[780],\r\n_Macrostachya_[781], &c.). Stems of this type have also been described\r\nby more recent writers under different names, and considerable\r\nconfusion has been caused by the use of numerous generic designations\r\nfor forms of _Calamitina_. Some small fragments of _Calamitina_ stems\r\nwere described by Salter[782] in 1863 as portions of a new species\r\nof the Crustacean _Eurypterus_ (_E. mammatus_). In 1869 Grand’Eury\r\nproposed the generic name _Calamophyllites_[783] for stems bearing\r\nverticils of _Asterophyllites_ shoots; his description of such stems\r\nagrees with Weiss’ _Calamitina_, but as Grand’Eury’s name is used in\r\na narrower sense as implying a connection with _Asterophyllites_,\r\nit is more convenient to adopt Weiss’ term in spite of the priority\r\nof _Calamophyllites_. In the _Fossil flora of Commentry_ we find\r\nsome flattened stems of the _Calamitina_ type described under\r\ndifferent generic names, as _Arthropitys approximatus_[784] and as\r\n_Macrostachya_[785].\r\n\r\nThe determination of distinct species of the sub-genus _Calamitina_\r\nis rendered almost hopeless by the variation in the different\r\nbranches of the same individual, and by the difficulty of connecting\r\nsurface-impressions with casts of the pith-cavity.\r\n\r\nA typical example of the _Calamitina_ type of _Calamites_ was figured\r\nby Sternberg[786] in 1821 as _Calamites varians_. This has been\r\nadopted by Weiss[787] as a comprehensive species including several\r\ndifferent ‘forms’ of stems, which differ from Sternberg’s fossil in\r\nsuch points as the number of nodes between the branch-whorls and\r\nthe number of branches in each whorl. The result of this system of\r\nnomenclature is the separation of portions of one specific type under\r\ndifferent form-names. It must be clearly recognised that accurate\r\nspecific diagnoses are practically impossible when we have to deal with\r\nfragments of plants, some of which are mere pith-casts, while others\r\nshow the surface features. The specimen represented in fig. 99 agrees\r\nwith a stem described by Ettingshausen[788] in 1855 as _Calamites\r\nGöpperti_, and as a matter of convenience a member of the _Calamitina_\r\ngroup showing such characters may be referred to as _Calamites_\r\n(_Calamitina_) _Göpperti_ (Ett.). The following list, which includes a\r\nfew synonyms of this form, may suffice to illustrate the difficulties\r\nconnected with accurate systematic determinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Calamites_ (_Calamitina_) _Göpperti_ (Ett.).

The pith-cast of this type of stem has short ribbed\r\ninternodes separated by rather deep nodal constrictions; the\r\nbranch-whorls being represented by a series of pits on the nodal\r\nconstrictions recurring at corresponding intervals to the whorls of\r\nbranch-scars on the surface of the stem. Leaves narrow and linear\r\nin form, like those on Asterophyllitean branches, are occasionally\r\nassociated with this type of stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101. _Calamites_ (_Calamitina_) sp. From a specimen\r\n  in the British Museum. (After Carruthers.) Slightly reduced.]\r\n\r\nThe fragment of a _Calamitina_ stem shown in fig. 101 is the\r\ncounterpart of a specimen originally figured by Steinhauer[798] in 1818\r\nas a species of _Phytolithus_. This may be specifically identical with\r\n_C. Göpperti_; but it is better to speak of so small a specimen as\r\nmerely one of the _Calamitina_ stems, to be compared with _Calamites_\r\n(_Calamitina_) _Göpperti_. The specimen measures 14·5 cm. in length and\r\n7 cm. in breadth.\r\n\r\nThe form of pith-cast represented in fig. 100 is no doubt that of\r\none of the _Calamitina_ species, but as it is seldom possible to\r\ndetermine the connection between such casts and the particular\r\nspecies of stems to which they belong, they are often referred to as\r\n_Calamites_ (_Calamitina_) _approximatus_ (Brongn.). The specimen of\r\nwhich fig. 100 is a photograph was originally described and figured\r\nby Mr Kidston[799] from the lower Coal-Measures of Ayrshire. Both\r\n_Calamites_ (_Calamitina_) _Göpperti_ (Ett.) and _C._ (_Calamitina_)\r\n_approximatus_ (Brongn.) are recorded from the Transition, Middle and\r\nLower Coal-Measures[800].\r\n\r\n\r\n                         B. _Stylocalamites._\r\n\r\nIn the members of this sub-genus the branch-scars are either irregular\r\nin their occurrence or absent. In some Calamites the branch-scars are\r\nvery few and far between, and other species appear to have been almost\r\nwithout branches; pith-casts of such stems may be referred to the\r\nsub-genus _Stylocalamites_[801].\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly common Calamitean cast, _C. Suckowi_ Brongn. (fig. 82)\r\naffords a good illustration of this type of stem. In the specimen shown\r\nin fig. 82 we have a cast of a rhizome, which is rather exceptional in\r\nshowing three branches in connection with one another. The appearance\r\nof the fossil suggests a rhizome, rather than an aerial shoot, bearing\r\nlateral branches; the narrowing of the branches and the rapid decrease\r\nin the length of the internodes towards the point of attachment being\r\nfeatures associated with rhizomes rather than with aerial branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Calamites_ (_Stylocalamites_) _Suckowi_, Brongn.

There are some unusually large\r\nexamples of casts of this species in the British Museum from the\r\nRadstock Coal-Measures; one of these has a length of 81 cm., and a\r\ndiameter of 27 cm. Specimens are not infrequently found with verticils\r\nof slender roots in close proximity to the nodes of the cast; figures\r\nof such root-bearing casts have been given by Lindley and Hutton[808],\r\nWeiss[809], and other authors.\r\n\r\nRenault[810] has drawn attention to the thinness of the layer of\r\nwood which is often associated with large casts of _C. Suckowi_; he\r\nconcludes that the stems must have possessed little or no secondary\r\nwood. In a more recent work by Grand’Eury[811] _Calamites Suckowi_\r\nis spoken of as having had wood of the _Calamodendron_ type, but as\r\nwood of this kind has not been found in England, it is suggested that\r\nthe plant may not have assumed an arborescent habit until late in\r\nthe Coal-Measure period. During the Lower and Middle Coal-Measures,\r\nat which horizon it commonly occurs in England, it may have been\r\nherbaceous. This suggestion has little to commend it; the close\r\nagreement between _C. Suckowi_ from English and French localities\r\npoints to a plant of the same form, and we have no satisfactory\r\nevidence as to any difference in stem-structure in the two cases.\r\n\r\nStur has figured a specimen of a Calamite cast, which he compares with\r\n_C. Suckowi_, surrounded by a band of silicified wood apparently of the\r\n_Arthropitys_ type. From this and other facts it would appear probable\r\nthat some of the English stems with the _Arthropitys_ structure\r\npossessed casts referable to _Calamites_ (_Stylocalamites_) _Suckowi_.\r\n\r\nWe are not in a position to speak with confidence as to the strobili\r\nof _C. Suckowi_, but Stur adduces evidence in support of a connection\r\nbetween this species of Calamite and certain Asterophyllitean branches\r\n(_Calamocladus equisetiformis_) bearing Calamostachyan cones. He does\r\nnot appear to have found the foliage-shoots and stems in organic\r\ncontact, but draws this conclusion from the association of the fertile\r\nbranches and stems in the same rocks[812]. This species is abundant in\r\nthe Lower, Middle and Upper Coal-Measures; it has also been recorded\r\nfrom the Millstone Grit[813].\r\n\r\n\r\n                           C. _Eucalamites._\r\n\r\nIn this sub-genus branch-scars occur on every node; the scars never\r\nform a contiguous whorl as in _Calamitina_, but there may be from 3\r\nto 10 on each node. The scars of successive nodes often alternate in\r\nposition, and thus form more or less regular vertical series as shown\r\nin fig. 102. The most obvious feature as regards the arrangement of\r\nthe branch-scars is their spiral disposition on the surface of the\r\npith-cast. The internodes are fairly uniform in length, and there is\r\nno periodic recurrence of narrower internodes as in _Calamitina_. From\r\nan examination of specimens of _Eucalamites_ in which the pith-cast\r\nis covered with a coaly layer representing the carbonised remains of\r\nthe wood and cortex, it would appear that the surface of the stems\r\nwas practically smooth. The coaly investment on _Eucalamites_ casts\r\nvaries considerably in thickness[814]; it is very unsafe to make use\r\nof the thickness of this layer as a test of the breadth of the wood in\r\nCalamitean stems. The branch-scars as seen in a surface-view of a stem\r\nare situated a little above the nodal lines, while depressions on the\r\npith-casts occur in the slight nodal constriction or immediately above\r\nit. Small leaf-scars have been described as occurring on the nodes\r\nbetween the branch-scars in specimens showing the surface features[815].\r\n\r\nThe species long known as _Calamites cruciatus_ Sternb. is usually\r\ntaken as the type of the sub-genus _Eucalamites_. Weiss[816] has\r\nsubdivided this species into several ‘forms,’ which he bases on the\r\nnumber of branch-scars on each node and on other characters; a more\r\nextended subdivision of _C. cruciatus_ has recently been made by\r\nSterzel[817], who admits the impossibility of separating the specific\r\nforms by means of the data at our disposal, but for purposes of\r\ngeological correlation he prefers to express slight differences by\r\nmeans of definite ‘forms’ or varieties. The more comprehensive use\r\nof the specific name _cruciatus_ as adopted by Zeiller in his _Flore\r\nde Valenciennes_[818] is, I believe, the better method to adopt.\r\nThe specimen shown in fig. 102 affords a good example of a typical\r\n_Calamites cruciatus_, it was found in the Middle Coal-Measures near\r\nBarnsley, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102. _Calamites_ (_Eucalamites_) _cruciatus_,\r\n  Sternb.

A\r\nrestoration of _Calamites_ (_Eucalamites_) _cruciatus_ is given by\r\nStur[829] in his classic work on the Calamites, but he does not make\r\nquite clear the supposed connection with the stems and the fertile\r\nshoots of the Asterophyllites type[830] which he describes. Another\r\nmember of the _Eucalamites_ group, which is better known as regards its\r\nfoliage-shoots, is _Calamites ramosus_, a species first described by\r\nArtis[831] in 1825. Stems of this species have been found in connection\r\nwith the branches and leaves of the _Annularia_[6] type, bearing\r\n_Calamostachys_[832] cones. In all probability pith-casts included in\r\nthe sub-genus _Eucalamites_ belonged to stems with foliage-shoots and\r\nprobably also with cones of more than one form.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NOMENCLATURE.]\r\n\r\nIn the above account of a few common pith-casts it has been pointed\r\nout that there is occasionally satisfactory evidence for connecting\r\ncertain casts with wood of a particular structure, and with sterile and\r\nfertile foliage-shoots of a definite type. It is, however, impossible\r\nin many cases to recognise with any certainty the leaf-bearing\r\nbranches and strobili of the different casts of _Calamites_; it is\r\nequally impossible to determine what type of pith-cast or what type\r\nof foliage-shoots belongs to petrified stem-fragments in which it is\r\npossible to investigate the microscopical features. The scattered\r\nand piece-meal nature of the material on which our general knowledge\r\nof Calamitean plants is based, necessitates a system of nomenclature\r\nwhich is artificial and clumsy; but the apparent absurdity of attaching\r\ndifferent names to fragments, which we believe to be portions of the\r\nsame genus, is of convenience from the point of view of the geologist\r\nand the systematist. As our material increases it will be possible to\r\nfurther simplify the nomenclature for Calamarian plants, but it is\r\nunwise to allow our desire for a simpler terminology to lead us into\r\nproposals which are based rather on suppositions than on established\r\nfact. If it were possible to discriminate between pith-casts of stems\r\nhaving the different anatomical characters designated by the three\r\nsub-genera, _Arthropitys_, _Arthrodendron_ and _Calamodendron_, the\r\ngenus _Calamites_ might be used in a much narrower and probably more\r\nnatural sense than that which we have adopted. The tests made use\r\nof by some authors for separating pith-casts of _Calamodendron_\r\nand _Arthropitys_ stems do not appear to be satisfactory; we want\r\nsome term to apply to all Calamitean casts irrespective of the\r\nanatomical features of the stems, or of the precise nature of the\r\nfoliage-branches. As used in the present chapter, _Calamites_ stands\r\nfor plants differing in certain features but possessing common\r\nstructural characters, which must be defined in a broad sense so as\r\nto include types which may be worthy of generic rank, but which for\r\nconvenience sake are included in a comprehensive generic name. The\r\nattempts to associate certain forms of foliage with _Arthropitys_ on\r\nthe one hand and with _Calamodendron_ on the other, cannot be said\r\nto be entirely satisfactory; we still lack data for a trustworthy\r\ndiagnosis of distinct Calamarian genera which shall include external\r\ncharacters as well as histological features. If we restricted the\r\ngenus _Calamites_ to stems with an _Arthropitys_ structure and an\r\nAsterophyllitean foliage, we should be driven into unavoidable error.\r\nWithin certain limits it is possible to distinguish generically or\r\neven specifically between petrified branches, and we already possess\r\nmaterial enough for fairly complete diagnoses founded on internal\r\nstructure; but it is not possible to make a parallel classification\r\nfor pith-casts and foliage-shoots. For this reason, and especially\r\nbearing in mind the importance of naming isolated foliage-shoots and\r\nstem-casts for geological purposes, I believe it is better to admit\r\nthe artificially wide application of the name _Calamites_, and to\r\nexpress more accurate knowledge, where possible, by the addition of a\r\nsubgeneric term. In dealing with distinctions exhibited by Calamitean\r\nstems it may be advisable to make use of specific names, but we\r\nmust keep before us the probability of the pith-cast and petrified\r\nstem-fragment of the same plant receiving different specific names.\r\nIf the structural type is designated by a special sub-genus, this\r\nwill tend to minimise the anomaly of using more than one binominal\r\ndesignation for what may be the same individual.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CALAMITES AND EQUISETUM.]\r\n\r\nThe following summary may serve to bring together the different generic\r\nand subgeneric terms which have been used in the foregoing account of\r\n_Calamites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CALAMITES.\r\n\r\nSubgenera having reference to the method of branching as seen in casts\r\nor impressions of the stem-surface or in pith-casts.\r\n\r\n  _Calamitina_,\r\n  _Eucalamites_,\r\n  _Stylocalamites_.\r\n\r\nSubgenera founded on anatomical characters in stems and branches.\r\n\r\n  _Arthropitys_,\r\n  _Calamodendron_,\r\n  _Arthrodendron_ (new sub-genus substituted for _Calamopitys_).\r\n\r\nGenus proposed for roots of _Calamites_ before their real nature was\r\nrecognised.

Conclusion.\r\n\r\nA brief sketch of the main features of _Calamites_ suffices to bring\r\nout the many points of agreement between the arborescent Calamite\r\nplants and the recent Equisetums. The slight variation in morphological\r\ncharacter among the present-day Horse-tails, contrasts with the\r\ngreater range as regards structural features among the types included\r\nin _Calamites_. The Horse-tails probably represent one of several\r\nlines of development which tend to converge in the Palaeozoic period;\r\nthe Calamite itself would appear to mark the culminating point of a\r\ncertain phylum of which we have one degenerate but closely allied\r\ndescendant in the genus _Equisetum_. We shall, however, be in a better\r\nposition to consider the general question of plant-evolution after we\r\nhave made ourselves familiar with other types of Palaeozoic plants.\r\nGrand’Eury’s[833] striking descriptions of forests of Calamites in the\r\nCoal-Measures of central France, enable us to form some idea of the\r\nhabit of growth of these plants with their stout branching rhizomes and\r\nerect aerial shoots.\r\n\r\nBy piecing together the evidence derived from different sources we\r\nmay form some idea of the appearance of a living Calamite. A stout\r\nbranching rhizome ascended obliquely or spread horizontally through\r\nsand or clay, with numerous whorls or tufts of roots penetrating into\r\nswampy soil. From the underground rhizome strong erect branches grew\r\nup as columnar stems to a height of fifty feet or more; in the lower\r\nand thicker portions the bark was fissured and somewhat rugged, but\r\nsmoother nearer the summit. Looking up the stem we should see old and\r\npartially obliterated scars marking the position of a ring of lateral\r\nbranches, and at a higher level tiers of branches given off at regular\r\nor gradually decreasing intervals, bearing on their upper portions\r\ngraceful green branchlets with whorls of narrow linear leaves. On the\r\nyounger parts of the main shoot rings of long and narrow leaves were\r\nborne at short intervals, several leaf-circles succeeding one another\r\nin the intervals between each radiating series of branches. On some\r\nof the leaf-bearing branchlets long and slender cones would be found\r\nhere and there taking the place of the ordinary leafy twigs. Passing to\r\nthe apical region of the stem the lateral branches given off at a less\r\nand less angle would appear more crowded, and at the actual tips there\r\nwould be a crowded succession of leaf-segments forming a series of\r\noverlapping circles of narrow sheaths with thin slender teeth bending\r\nover the apex of the tree.\r\n\r\nThus we may feebly attempt to picture to ourselves one of the many\r\ntypes of Calamite trees in a Palaeozoic forest, growing in a swampy\r\nmarsh or on gently sloping ground on the shores of an inland sea, into\r\nwhich running water carried its burden of sand and mud, and broken\r\ntwigs of Calamites and other trees which contributed to the Coal Period\r\nsediments. The large proportions of a Calamite tree are strikingly\r\nillustrated by some of the broad and long pith-casts occasionally\r\nseen in Museums; in the Breslau Collection there is a cast of a stem\r\nbelonging to the sub-genus _Calamitina_, which measures about 2 m. in\r\nlength and 23 cm. in breadth, with 36 nodes. In the Natural History\r\nMuseum, Paris, there is a cast nearly 2 metres long and more than 20\r\ncm. wide, which is referred to the sub-genus _Calamodendron_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         E. ARCHAEOCALAMITES.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper Devonian and Culm rocks casts of a well-defined Calamitean\r\nplant are characteristic fossils; stems, leaf-bearing branches, roots\r\nand cones have been described by several authors, and the genus\r\n_Archaeocalamites_ has been instituted for their reception. Although\r\nthis genus agrees in certain respects with _Calamites_, and as recent\r\nwork has shown this agreement extends to internal structure, it has\r\nbeen the custom to regard the Lower Carboniferous and Devonian plants\r\nas genetically distinct. The surface features of the stem-casts,\r\nthe form of the leaves, and apparently the cones, possess certain\r\ndistinctive characters which would seem to justify the retention of a\r\nseparate generic designation.\r\n\r\nWe may briefly summarise the characteristics of the genus as follows:—\r\n\r\nPith-casts articulated, with very slightly constricted nodes; the\r\ninternodes traversed by longitudinal ribs slightly elevated or\r\nalmost flat, separated by shallow grooves. The ribs and grooves are\r\ncontinuous from one internode to another, and do not usually show\r\nthe characteristic alternation of _Calamites_[834]. Along the nodal\r\nline there are occasionally found short longitudinal depressions,\r\nprobably marking the points of origin of outgoing bundles. Branches\r\nwere given off from the nodes without any regular order; a pith-cast\r\nmay have branch-scars on many of the nodes, or there may be no trace\r\nof branches on casts consisting of several nodes. The leaves[835]\r\nare in whorls; in some cases they occur as free, linear, lanceolate\r\nleaves, or on younger branches they are long, filiform and repeatedly\r\nforked. The structure of the wood agrees with that of some forms of\r\n_Arthropitys_. The strobili consist of an articulated axis bearing\r\nwhorls of sporangiophores, and each sporangiophore has four sporangia.\r\nOur knowledge of the fertile shoots is, however, very imperfect.\r\n\r\nRenault[836] has recently described the structure of the wood in some\r\nsmall silicified stems of _Archaeocalamites_ from Autun. A large hollow\r\npith is surrounded by a cylinder of wood consisting of wedge-shaped\r\ngroups of xylem tracheids associated with secondary medullary rays;\r\nat the apex of each primary xylem group there is a carinal canal. The\r\nprimary medullary rays appear to have been bridged across by bands of\r\nxylem at an early stage of secondary thickening, as in the Calamite of\r\nfig. 83, _D._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103. _Archaeocalamites scrobiculatus_ (Schloth.).\r\n\r\n  From a specimen in the Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge. From the\r\n  Carboniferous limestone of Northumberland. ½ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the cones of _Archaeocalamites_ is far from\r\nsatisfactory. Renault[837] has recently described a small fertile\r\nbranch bearing a succession of verticils of sporangiophores; each\r\nsporangiophore stands at right angles to the axis of the cone and\r\nbears four sporangia, as in _Calamostachys_. It is not clear how far\r\nthere is better evidence than that afforded by the association of\r\nthe specimen with pith-casts of stems, for referring this cone to\r\n_Archaeocalamites_, but the association of vegetative and fertile\r\nshoots certainly suggests an organic connection. The cone described by\r\nthe French author agrees with _Equisetum_ in the absence of sterile\r\nbracts between the whorls of sporangiophores. It is an interesting fact\r\nthat such a distinctly Equisetaceous strobilus is known to have existed\r\nin Lower Carboniferous rocks.\r\n\r\nStur[838] has also described _Archaeocalamites_ at considerable\r\nlength; he gives several good figures of stem-casts and foliage-shoots\r\nbearing long and often forked narrow leaves. The same writer describes\r\nspecimens of imperfectly preserved cones in which portions of whorls\r\nof forked filiform leaves are given off from the base of the\r\nstrobilus[839]. Kidston[840] published an important memoir on the cones\r\nof _Archaeocalamites_ in 1883, in which he advanced good evidence\r\nin support of the view that certain strobili, which were originally\r\ndescribed as Monocotyledonous inflorescences, under the generic\r\nname _Pothocites_[841], are the fertile shoots of this Calamarian\r\ngenus. Kidston’s conclusions are based on the occurrence on the\r\n_Pothocites_ cones, of leaves like those of _Archaeocalamites_, on the\r\nnon-alternation of the sporangiophores of successive whorls, and on the\r\nclose resemblance between his specimens and those described by Stur.\r\nGood specimens of the cones, formerly known as _Pothocites_, may be\r\nseen in the Botanical Museum in the Royal Gardens, Edinburgh; as they\r\nare in the form of casts without internal structure it is difficult to\r\nform a clear conception as to their morphological features.\r\n\r\nThe fossils included under _Archaeocalamites_ have been referred\r\nby different authors to various genera, and considerable confusion\r\nhas arisen in both generic and specific nomenclature. The following\r\nsynonomy of the best known species, _A. scrobiculatus_ (Schloth.)\r\nillustrates the unfortunate use of several terms for the same plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Archaeocalamites scrobiculatus_ (Schloth.).

An examination of the original\r\nspecimens, figured by Göppert under various names, enables one to\r\nrefer them with confidence to the single species, _Archaeocalamites\r\nscrobiculatus_. The generic name _Archaeocalamites_, which has been\r\nemployed by some authors, was suggested by Schimper[854] in 1862, as\r\na subgenus of _Calamites_, on account of the occurrence of a deeply\r\ndivided leaf-sheath, attached to the node of a pith-cast, which seemed\r\nto differ from the usual type of Calamitean leaf. The specimens\r\ndescribed by Schimper are in the Strassburg Museum; the leaf-sheath\r\nwhich he figures is not very accurately represented.\r\n\r\nThe example given in fig. 103 shews very clearly the continuous course\r\nof the ribs and grooves of the pith-cast. Each rib is traversed by a\r\nnarrow median groove which would seem to represent the projecting edge\r\nof some hard tissue in the middle of each principal medullary ray of\r\nthe stem. The specimen was found in a Carboniferous limestone quarry,\r\nNorthumberland; there is a similar cast from the same locality in the\r\nMuseum of the Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Affinities of_ Archaeocalamites.\r\n\r\nThis genus agrees very closely with _Calamites_ both in the anatomical\r\nstructure of the stem and in the verticillate disposition of the\r\nleaves. The strobili appear to be Equisetaceous in character, and there\r\nis no satisfactory evidence of the existence of whorls of sterile\r\nbracts in the cone, such as occur in _Calamostachys_ and in other\r\nCalamitean strobili. The continuous course of the vascular bundles of\r\nthe stem from one internode to the next is the most striking feature\r\nin the ordinary specimens of the genus; but it sometimes happens that\r\nthe grooves on a pith-cast shew the same alternation at the node as in\r\n_Calamites_. This is the case in a specimen in the Göppert collection\r\nin the Breslau Museum, and Feistmantel[855] has called attention to\r\nsuch an alternation in specimens from Rothwaltersdorf. In the true\r\n_Calamites_, on the other hand, the usual nodal alternation of the\r\nvascular strands is by no means a constant character[856]. Stur[857],\r\nRothpletz[858], and other authors have pointed out the resemblance of\r\n_Archaeocalamites_ to _Sphenophyllum_. The deeply divided leaves of\r\nsome Sphenophyllums and those of _Archaeocalamites_ are very similar\r\nin form; and the course of the vascular strands in _Sphenophyllum_\r\nmay be compared with that in _Archaeocalamites_. But the striking\r\ndifference in the structure of the stele forms a wide gap between the\r\ntwo genera. We have evidence that the Calamites and Sphenophyllums were\r\nprobably descended from a common ancestral stock, and it may be that in\r\n_Archaeocalamites_, some of the _Sphenophyllum_ characters have been\r\nretained; but there is no close affinity between the two plants.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, considering the age of _Archaeocalamites_ and the few\r\ncharacters with which we are acquainted, it is probable that this\r\ngenus is very closely related to the typical _Calamites_, and may be\r\nregarded as a type which is in the direct line of development of the\r\nmore modern Calamite and the living _Equisetum_. Weiss[859] includes\r\n_Archaeocalamites_ as one of his subgenera with _Calamitina_ and\r\nothers, and it is quite possible that the genus has not more claim to\r\nstand alone than other forms at present included in the comprehensive\r\ngenus _Calamites_.\r\n\r\nThe student will find detailed descriptions of this genus in the works\r\nwhich have been referred to in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                         II. SPHENOPHYLLALES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Sphenophyllum._\r\n\r\nThe genus _Sphenophyllum_ is placed in a special class, as representing\r\na type which cannot be legitimately included in any of the existing\r\ngroups of Vascular Cryptogams. Although this Palaeozoic genus possesses\r\npoints of contact with various living plants, it is generally admitted\r\nby palaeobotanists that it constitutes a somewhat isolated type among\r\nthe Pteridophytes of the Coal-Measures. Our knowledge of the anatomy\r\nof both vegetative shoots and strobili is now fairly complete, and the\r\nfacts that we possess are in favour of excluding the genus from any of\r\nthe three main divisions of the Pteridophyta.\r\n\r\nIn Scheuchzer’s _Herbarium Diluvianum_ there is a careful drawing of\r\nsome fragments of slender twigs, from an English locality, bearing\r\nverticils of cuneiform leaves, which the author compares with the\r\ncommon _Galium_[860]. As regards superficial external resemblance, the\r\n_Galium_ of our hedgerows agrees very closely with what must have been\r\nthe appearance of fresh green shoots of _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n\r\nA twig of the same species of _Sphenophyllum_ is figured by\r\nSchlotheim[861] in the first part of his work on fossil plants;\r\nhe regards it as probably a fragment of some species of Palm.\r\nSternberg[862] was the first to institute a generic name for this\r\ngenus of plants, and specimens were described by him in 1825 as a\r\nspecies of the genus _Rotularia_. The name _Sphenophyllites_ was\r\nproposed by Brongniart[863] in 1822 as a substitute for Schlotheim’s\r\ngenus, and in a later work[864] the French author instituted the genus\r\n_Sphenophyllum_. Dawson[865] was the first to make any reference to\r\nthe anatomy of this genus; but it is from the examination of the much\r\nmore perfect material from St. Étienne, Autun, and other continental\r\nlocalities, the North of England and Pettycur in Scotland, by Renault,\r\nWilliamson, Zeiller and Scott, that our more complete knowledge has\r\nbeen acquired.\r\n\r\nThe affinity of _Sphenophyllum_ has always been a matter of\r\nspeculation; it has been compared with Dicotyledons, Palms, Conifers\r\n(_Ginkgo_ and _Phyllocladus_), and various Pteridophytes, such as\r\n_Ophioglossum_, _Tmesipteris_, _Marsilia_, _Salvinia_, _Equisetum_ and\r\nthe Lycopodiaceae[866].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEFINITION.]\r\n\r\nWe may define the genus _Sphenophyllum_ as follows:—\r\n\r\nStem comparatively slender (1·5–15 mm.?), articulated, usually somewhat\r\ntumid at the nodes; the surface of the internodes is marked by more or\r\nless distinct ribs and grooves which do not alternate at the nodes,\r\nbut follow a straight course from one internode to the next. A single\r\nbranch is occasionally given off from a node. Adventitious roots are\r\nvery rarely seen, their surface does not show the ridges and grooves of\r\nthe foliage-shoots.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are borne in verticils at the nodes, those in the same whorl\r\nbeing usually of the same size, but in some forms two of the leaves are\r\ndistinctly smaller than the others. Each verticil contains normally\r\n6, 9, 12, 18 or more leaves, which are separate to the base and not\r\nfused into a sheath; the number of leaves in a verticil is not always\r\na multiple of six. They vary in form from cuneiform with a narrow\r\ntapered base, and a lamina traversed by several forked veins, to narrow\r\nuninerved leaves and leaves with a lamina dissected into dichotomously\r\nbranched linear segments. The leaves of successive whorls are\r\nsuperposed.\r\n\r\nThe strobili are long and narrow in form, having a length in some\r\ncases of 12 cm., and a diameter of 12 mm.; they occur as shortly\r\nstalked lateral branches, or terminate long leaf-bearing shoots. The\r\naxis of the cone bears whorls of numerous linear lanceolate bracts\r\nfused basally into a coherent funnel-shaped disc, bearing on its upper\r\nsurface sporangiophores and sporangia.\r\n\r\nThe strobili are usually isosporous, but possibly heterosporous in some\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThe stem is monostelic, with a triarch or hexarch triangular strand\r\nof centripetally developed primary xylem, consisting of reticulate,\r\nscalariform and spiral tracheae; the protoxylem elements being\r\nsituated at the blunt corners of the xylem-strand. Foliar bundles are\r\ngiven off, either singly or in pairs, from each angle of the central\r\nprimary strand. The secondary xylem consists of radially disposed\r\nreticulate or scalariform tracheae, developed from a cambium-layer.\r\nThe phloem is made up of thin-walled elements, including sieve-tubes\r\nand parenchyma. Both xylem and phloem include secondary medullary\r\nrays of parenchymatous cells. The cortex consists in part of fairly\r\nthick-walled elements; in older stems the greater part of the cortical\r\nregion is cut off by the development of deep-seated layers of periderm.\r\n\r\nThe roots are apparently diarch in structure, with a lacunar and smooth\r\ncortex.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe branch of _Sphenophyllum emarginatum_ Brongn. given in fig. 109\r\nshows the characteristic appearance of the genus as represented by this\r\nwell-known species which Brongniart figured in 1822. The Indian species\r\nshown in fig. 111 illustrates the occurrence of unequal leaves in the\r\nsame whorl, and in fig. 110, _B_, we have a form of verticil in which\r\nthe leaves are deeply divided into filiform segments. A larger-leaved\r\nform is represented by _S. Thoni_, Mahr. (fig. 110, _A_), a species\r\noccasionally met with in Permian rocks.\r\n\r\nNo specimens of _Sphenophyllum_ have so far been found attached to\r\na thick stem; they always occur as slender shoots, which sometimes\r\nreach a considerable length. One of the longest examples known is in\r\nthe collection of the Austrian Geological Survey; the axis is 4 mm. in\r\nbreadth and 85 cm. long, bearing a slender branch 61 cm. in length. The\r\nmanner of occurrence of the specimen as a curved slender stem on the\r\nsurface of the rock suggests a weak plant, which must have depended\r\nfor support on some external aid, either water or another plant. The\r\nanatomical structure and other features do not favour the suggestion\r\nof some writers that _Sphenophyllum_ was a water-plant[867], but there\r\nwould seem to be no serious obstacle in the way of regarding it as\r\npossibly a slender plant which flung itself on the branches and stems\r\nof stronger forest trees for support.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A. The anatomy of Sphenophyllum.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the structural features of the stem and root\r\nis based on the work of Renault[868], Williamson[869] and Williamson\r\nand Scott[870]. We may first consider such characters as have been\r\nrecognised in different examples of the genus, and then notice briefly\r\nthe distinguishing peculiarities of two well-marked specific types.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _a._ _Stems._\r\n\r\ni. Primary structure.\r\n\r\nIn a transverse section of a young _Sphenophyllum_ stem such as that\r\ndiagrammatically sketched in fig. 105, _A_, we find in the centre\r\nthe xylem portion of a single stele with a characteristic triangular\r\nform. The primary xylem consists mainly of fairly large tracheae with\r\nnumerous pits on their walls; towards the end of each arm the tracheids\r\nbecome scalariform, and at the apex there is a group of narrower\r\nspiral protoxylem elements. In the British species there is a single\r\nprotoxylem group at the apex of each arm, but Renault has described\r\nsome French stems in which the stele appears to be hexarch, having two\r\nprotoxylem groups at the end of each of the three rays of the stele.\r\nThe primary xylem strand of _Sphenophyllum_ has therefore a root-like\r\nstructure, the tracheids having been developed centripetally from the\r\nthree initial protoxylem groups. This type of structure is typical\r\nof roots, but it also occurs in the stems of some recent Vascular\r\nCryptogams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104. Diagrammatic longitudinal section of\r\n  _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n\r\n  _c_, outer cortex; _b_, space next the stele, originally occupied\r\n  by phloem _etc._; _a_, xylem strand. (After Renault[871].) × 7.]\r\n\r\nAs a rule the tissue next the xylem has not been petrified, but in\r\nexceptionally well-preserved examples it is seen to consist of a band\r\nof thin-walled elements, of which those in contact with the xylem may\r\nbe spoken of as phloem, and those beyond as the pericycle. Succeeding\r\nthis band of delicate tissue there is a broader band of thicker-walled\r\nand somewhat elongated elements, constituting the cortex. The specimen\r\ndrawn in fig. 105, _A_, shows very prominent grooves in the cortex\r\nopposite the middle of each bay of the primary wood. It is these\r\ngrooves that give to the ordinary casts of _Sphenophyllum_ branches\r\nthe appearance of longitudinal lines traversing each internode. In a\r\nlongitudinal section of a stem, the cortical tissue (fig. 104, _c_)\r\nis found to be broader in the nodal regions, thus giving rise to the\r\ntumid nodes referred to in the diagnosis. The increased breadth at the\r\nnodes does not mean that the xylem is broader in these regions, as it\r\nis in Calamite stems. Small strands of vascular tissue are given off\r\nfrom the three edges of the triangular stele (fig. 105 _A_) at each\r\nnode; these branch in passing through the cortex on their way to the\r\nverticils of leaves. The space _b_ in the diagrammatic section of fig.\r\n104 was originally occupied by the phloem and inner cortex. In some\r\nspecies of _Sphenophyllum_ the apex of each arm of the xylem strand,\r\nas seen in transverse section, is occupied by a longitudinal canal\r\nsurrounded by spiral tracheids, as in the primary xylem of the old stem\r\nshown in fig. 105, _C_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105. _Sphenophyllum._\r\n\r\n  _A._ Transverse section of young stem.\r\n\r\n  _B._ Transverse section of the wood of a young stem; _px_,\r\n      protoxylem; _x_, secondary xylem.

(_D_ and _E_ after\r\n      Williamson and Scott.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nii. Secondary structure.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of very young twigs the petrified _Sphenophyllum_\r\nstems usually show a greater or less development of secondary wood.\r\nIn the xylem-strand of fig. 105, _B_, the broad concave bays of the\r\nprimary wood have been filled in by the development of two rows of\r\nlarge secondary tracheids, _x_, but opposite the protoxylem groups,\r\n_px_, there are no signs of cambial activity. In the unusually large\r\nstem represented by a rough sketch in fig. 105, _C_, the triangular\r\nprimary xylem lies in the centre of a thick mass of secondary vascular\r\ntissue. The secondary and primary wood together have a diameter of\r\nabout 5 mm.\r\n\r\nAfter the bays between each protoxylem corner have been filled\r\nin, the formation of secondary wood proceeds uniformly along the\r\nstem radii, but the rows of tracheids and medullary rays which are\r\ndeveloped opposite the corners of the primary strand, _c_, differ in\r\ncertain characters from the broader masses of wood opposite the bays.\r\nFor convenience, the secondary wood, _c_, opposite the protoxylem\r\ngroups has been spoken of as _fascicular wood_, and the rest, _d_, as\r\n_interfascicular wood_.\r\n\r\nThe secondary xylem consists either of tracheae with numerous bordered\r\npits on their radial walls (fig. 105, _D_), or of tracheae with broad\r\nand bordered scalariform pits (fig. 105, _E_). The suggestion of\r\nconcentric rings of growth in the wood in fig. 105, _C_, is rather\r\ndeceptive; there are no well-marked regular rings in _Sphenophyllum_\r\nstems, but irregular bands of smaller elements occasionally interrupt\r\nthe uniformity of the secondary xylem. In some stems the medullary rays\r\nhave the form of rows of parenchymatous cells, which in tangential\r\nlongitudinal section are found to consist frequently of a single row\r\nof radially disposed elements; this type of medullary rays occurs\r\nin the species _Sphenophyllum insigne_, in which the tracheae are\r\nscalariform. Three medullary rays, _r_, are seen on the radial face of\r\nthe scalariform tracheids in fig. 105, _E_, which represents a radial\r\nsection of this species. In other species, _e.g._ _S. plurifoliatum_,\r\nthe medullary rays have a peculiar and characteristic structure;\r\nin a transverse section of the stem they appear as groups of a few\r\nparenchymatous cells in the spaces between the truncated angles of the\r\nlarge tracheae (fig. 106). In longitudinal section these medullary-ray\r\nelements resemble thick bars stretching radially across the face of the\r\ntracheae (fig. 105, _D_, _r_); the apparent septa or bars are however\r\nthin-walled cells connecting the different groups of medullary-ray\r\ncells, as seen in a transverse section. These radial connecting cells\r\nare occasionally seen as short rays in transverse sections of stems.\r\n\r\nThe cambium and phloem elements are occasionally preserved in good\r\nspecimens of older stems; the former consist of tabular flatted\r\nthin-walled cells, and the latter in some cases include large\r\nsieve-tubes and narrower parenchymatous elements.\r\n\r\nThe sections shown in fig. 107, _E_ and _F_, illustrate the\r\npreservation of cambial and phloem tissue. In the transverse section\r\nof fig. 107, _F_, the secondary xylem with the medullary rays, _r_, is\r\nsucceeded by a few tabular cambium cells, and external to these there\r\nare thin-walled elements of unequal size representing the phloem.\r\nIn fig. 107, _E_, the scalariform tracheids are succeeded by narrow\r\nthin-walled cells, and the larger elements with transverse and oblique\r\nsepta are no doubt sieve-tubes.\r\n\r\nIn the large stem of fig. 105, _C_, the xylem is succeeded by\r\na band of tissue, a, which is no doubt phloem, and external to\r\nthis there is a considerable development of periderm (_b_). The\r\nperiderm in _Sphenophyllum_ stems had a deep-seated origin, the\r\nphellogen or cork-cambium occasionally being formed in the secondary\r\nphloem-parenchyma, and in other cases in the pericycle, as in the stems\r\nof some living dicotyledons. Williamson and Scott[872] describe stems\r\nin which a succession of phellogens were formed at different levels,\r\nthus producing a scaly type of bark, such as we find in the Pine or the\r\nPlane tree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPHENOPHYLLUM PLURIFOLIATUM.]\r\n\r\nBefore describing the structure of the strobili of _Sphenophyllum_, we\r\nmay briefly point out the distinguishing features of two specific types\r\nof the genus recently described by Williamson and Scott. One of these\r\nspecies, _S. insigne_, was originally described by Williamson as an\r\n_Asterophyllites_; the numerous narrow linear leaves in each verticil\r\nled to the inclusion of the specimens in the latter genus. The material\r\non which this species is founded is from the volcanic beds of Pettycur,\r\nBurntisland, on the coast of the Firth of Forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n      1. _Sphenophyllum insigne_ (Will.). Figs. 105, _C_ and _E_,\r\n                         and 107, _E_ and _F_.\r\n\r\n          1891. _Asterophyllites insignis_. Williamson[873].\r\n\r\nAn _intercellular space_ occurs at each angle of the three-rayed\r\nprimary xylem strand, and spiral tracheae are abundant. The tracheae\r\nof the secondary wood have _scalariform markings_ on the radial walls.\r\n_Regular medullary rays_ extend through the secondary wood. The phloem\r\ncontains large sieve-tubes.\r\n\r\nThis species occurs in the Calciferous sandstone rocks of Burntisland,\r\nand has lately been recorded from Germany. It characterises a lower\r\nhorizon than _S. plurifoliatum_ (Will. and Scott).\r\n\r\n\r\n     2. _Sphenophyllum plurifoliatum_ (Williamson and Scott)[874].\r\n                Figs. 105, _A_, _B_, and _D_, and 106.\r\n\r\n         1891. _Asterophyllites sphenophylloides._ Will.[875]\r\n\r\nThe specific name _plurifoliatum_ was proposed by Williamson and\r\nScott for a type of stem originally described by Williamson[876] as\r\nan _Asterophyllites_, from the Coal-Measures of Oldham, Lancashire.\r\nThis form of stem has not so far been connected with any of the\r\nolder species founded on external characters, but it evidently bore\r\nfoliage in which the leaves were deeply divided, as in _Sphenophyllum\r\ntrichomatosum_ (fig. 110, _B_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106. Sphenophyllum plurifoliatum, Will. and Scott.\r\n  From a photograph by Mr Highly from a section in the Williamson\r\n  Collection (no. 899). × 27.]\r\n\r\nIn this species there are _no canals_ at the angles of the primary\r\nxylem, and there are fewer spiral tracheae than in _S. insigne_. The\r\ntracheae of the secondary wood have _numerous small pits_ on the radial\r\nwalls, and the medullary rays are chiefly composed of parenchymatous\r\ncells, which appear in transverse section as _groups of cells_ between\r\nthe truncated angles of the tracheae. The characters are fairly well\r\nseen in the xylem portion of a stele shown in fig. 106. The fascicular\r\nwood includes some rows of parenchymatous medullary-ray cells in\r\naddition to the characteristic groups, as seen in the figure. A\r\nslightly oblique transverse section of a stem is often convenient in\r\nthe interpretation of histological features; one of the sections of _S.\r\nplurifoliatum_ in the Williamson collection (no. 893), which has been\r\ncut somewhat obliquely, shows very clearly the differences in pitting\r\nexhibited by the different xylem elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _b. Roots._\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the anatomy of _Sphenophyllum_ roots is very limited.\r\nRenault has described a somewhat imperfect example of a silicified\r\nroot from St. Étienne and Autun. The drawing in fig. 107, _B_, which\r\nis copied from one of Renault’s figures, shows a cylindrical mass of\r\nxylem with a small band of narrower elements occupying the centre, and\r\nsurrounded by rows of larger secondary tracheae. The central bipolar\r\nband is described as the diarch primary xylem, around which the\r\nsecondary pitted elements have been developed.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the specimen described by Renault is a root of\r\n_Sphenophyllum_, but my impression gained from an examination of the\r\nsection was that the diarch primary strand is not quite so clear as\r\nin the published figures. Until we possess better material we cannot\r\nattempt any very satisfactory description of the anatomical features of\r\nthe roots of this genus.\r\n\r\nA section of a _Sphenophyllum_ stem has been figured by Felix[877], in\r\nwhich a lateral member is being given off; this may possibly represent\r\nthe origin of an adventitious root, but the preservation is not\r\nsufficiently distinct to render this certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _c. Leaves._\r\n\r\nRenault[878] has described some silicified leaves of _Sphenophyllum_\r\nfrom Autun in which the laminae consist of thin-walled loose\r\nparenchyma, traversed by small groups of tracheids constituting the\r\nsimple or forked veins. The epidermis is made up of a single layer of\r\ncells, with here and there indistinct indications of stomata. A more\r\nperfect stoma has, however, been described by Solms-Laubach from the\r\nepidermis of a bract in a strobilus (fig. 107, _A_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107. A.

Cones._\r\n\r\nThe history of the recognition of the cones of _Sphenophyllum_ has\r\nalready been briefly alluded to in chapter V., p. 100. The main\r\npoints in the structure of the cones of this genus were known for\r\nseveral years, before the fact was established that they belonged to\r\n_Sphenophyllum_ stems. In 1871 Williamson[879] published an account\r\nof an imperfect fossil strobilus from the Lower Coal-Measures of\r\nOldham, Lancashire, under the name of _Volkmannia Dawsoni_. The\r\ngeneric term _Volkmannia_ has been used by different writers for\r\ncones varying considerably in structural features; in the case of\r\nWilliamson’s fossil, Weiss[880] substituted the name _Bowmanites_,\r\na genus instituted by Binney[881] for a strobilus apparently of the\r\nsame type as _Volkmannia Dawsoni_. In 1891 Williamson[882] described\r\nsome additional specimens of _Bowmanites Dawsoni_, and, as in his\r\nearlier paper, he compared the strobilus with _Asterophyllites_ and\r\n_Sphenophyllum_, but it was still a matter of speculation as to what\r\nwas the form of the vegetative branches. Soon after the more complete\r\naccount of the English cones was published, Zeiller[883] recognised\r\na close agreement between some French and Belgian specimens of\r\n_Sphenophyllum_ strobili and the strobilus described by Williamson.\r\nA closer comparison thoroughly established the connection between\r\n_Bowmanites Dawsoni_ and _Sphenophyllum_; and there is little doubt\r\nthat this strobilus belongs to the stem known as _Sphenophyllum\r\ncuneifolium_ (Sternb.)—a well-known species of the genus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STROBILUS.]\r\n\r\nThe most important morphological features of the strobilus of\r\n_Sphenophyllum_ may best be illustrated by a detailed account of one\r\nspecific type, and by a brief reference to other forms which are\r\ncharacterised by certain differences in the number and attachment of\r\nthe sporangia. When we know that a given strobilus must have grown on\r\na _Sphenophyllum_ stem, the obvious name to assign to it would seem\r\nto be that of the plant which bore it; but there are advantages in\r\nmaking use of special generic terms for detached cones, which cannot\r\nbe referred with certainty to a particular species of stem. The genus\r\n_Calamostachys_ affords an example of a name which is intended to\r\ndenote that a cone so called belongs to a Calamarian plant; similarly\r\nsuch a name as _Sphenophyllostachys_ may be used for Sphenophylloid\r\ncones which cannot be connected with certainty to particular species\r\nof _Sphenophyllum_. It has been suggested that the genus _Bowmanites_,\r\nfirst used for a cone which was afterwards recognised as belonging to a\r\n_Sphenophyllum_, should be employed instead of the sesquipedalian term\r\n_Sphenophyllostachys_. The latter is used here as being in accordance\r\nwith a generally accepted and convenient system of nomenclature, and\r\nas a name which at once denotes the fact that the fossil is not only a\r\ncone but that it belongs to a _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni_ (Will.). Figs. 107, _A_ and _G_, 108.\r\n\r\n   Probably the strobilus of _Sphenophyllum cuneifolium_ (Sternb.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108. Diagrammatic longitudinal section of a\r\n  _Sphenophyllum_ strobilus. The upper figure represents a portion of\r\n  a whorl of bracts. (The smaller figure, after Zeiller.)]\r\n\r\nThe cone consists of a central axis bearing a number of verticils\r\nof bracts coherent in their lower portions in the form of a widely\r\nopen funnel-shaped disc, which splits up peripherally into 14–20\r\nlinear-lanceolate segments. The free segments of each verticil have an\r\nobliquely ascending or almost vertical position, and extend upwards\r\nfor a distance of about six internodes. The smaller drawing in fig.\r\n108 shows the appearance in side view of the narrow bracts of a single\r\nwhorl. A transverse section of a strobilus would include, therefore,\r\nsections of several concentric series of ascending bracts. The\r\nverticils of _Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni_ are probably superposed,\r\nbut this point has not been definitely settled. From the upper surface\r\nof the coherent basal portion of each verticil, there are given off\r\ntwice as many sporangiophores as there are free segments, and these\r\nare attached close to the line of junction of the axis of the cone\r\nand the funnel-shaped disc. Each sporangiophore has the form of a\r\nslender stalk which bends inwards at its distal end and bears a single\r\nsporangium (_cf._ fig. 107, _D_). The sporangiophores given off from\r\nthe same verticil of bracts vary in length. All the sporangiophores\r\nare attached to the coherent bracts at the same distance from the axis\r\nof the cone; but as the sporangia between each verticil of bracts\r\nare arranged in two or three concentric series, it follows that the\r\nlength of the sporangiophores varies considerably. The diagrammatic\r\nlongitudinal section of a strobilus in fig. 108 shows three concentric\r\nseries of sporangia between successive bract-verticils. A similar\r\ndiagram was published by Williamson in 1892[884], and afterwards copied\r\nby Potonié[885], but in Williamson’s restoration the sporangiophores\r\nof the three series of sporangia are erroneously represented as\r\narising from different points on the surface of the bracts. There is\r\nlittle doubt, as regards the strobilus of _S. cuneifolium_, that the\r\nsporangiophores were given off in a single series close to the axils of\r\nthe bracts, as is partially shown in fig. 108.\r\n\r\nThe central part of the axis of the cone is occupied by a single\r\ntriangular stele like that of the stem, except that each ray of the\r\nxylem strand has a comparatively broad blunt termination, and is\r\nnot tapered to a narrow arm as in fig. 105, _A_ and _B_. The wood\r\nconsists of pitted tracheae, with two groups of protoxylem elements at\r\neach of the truncated angles of the solid strand of xylem. From the\r\nangles of the stele branches of vascular tissue pass out through the\r\ncortex to supply the sterile and fertile segments of each verticil.\r\nOne of the transverse sections of the _Sphenophyllum_ cone in the\r\nBritish Museum Collection (no. 1898 _E_) affords a good example of the\r\nmisleading appearance occasionally presented by an intruded ‘rootlet’\r\nof _Stigmaria_; the vascular tissue of the cone has disappeared, and a\r\nStigmarian appendage with its vascular bundle occupies the position of\r\nthe stelar tissues.\r\n\r\nThe bracts consist of parenchymatous tissue limited externally by an\r\nepidermis containing stomata. A single stoma with subsidiary cells\r\nis represented in fig. 107, _A_. The sporangiophores are composed\r\ninternally of thin-walled cells with stronger cells towards the\r\nsurface. The longer sporangiophores in a series may be more or less\r\ncoherent for part of their length to the upper surface of the verticil\r\nof bracts. In fig. 108 the slender sporangiophores do not appear to\r\ncome off always from the same portion of the bracts, but this is due to\r\nsome of them lying on the surface of the latter during part of their\r\ncourse to support the external circle of sporangia. The hook-like\r\ndistal end of a sporangiophore, towards the point of attachment of the\r\nsporangium, is characterised by the larger size and greater prominence\r\nof the surface cells; these larger cells, which pass over the upper\r\nsurface of a sporangium base, probably constitute a kind of _annulus_\r\nwhich determines the dehiscence of the sporangial wall[886].\r\n\r\nFig. 107, _G_, represents a sporangiophore and its sporangium cut\r\nthrough transversely just below the point of attachment of the latter\r\nto the end of the hook-like termination of the former. The spores are\r\ncharacterised by an irregularly reticulate thickening of the outer coat\r\nor exospore, as seen in the figure.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief points of interest suggested by a _Sphenophyllum_\r\ncone is the exact morphological nature of the sporangiophores. Are\r\nthey branches borne in the axils of bracts, or may we regard each\r\nsporangiophore as a modified leaf, which has become coherent with\r\nthe whorls of sterile leaves? Or is a sporangiophore merely a stalk\r\nof a sporangium; or a ventral lobe of a leaf, of which the sterile\r\nbracts represent the dorsal lobes? Although it is impossible without\r\nthe evidence of development to decide with certainty between these\r\nalternatives, it would seem most probable that a sporangiophore may\r\nbe looked upon as a ventral lobe of a leaf, the sterile lobes forming\r\nthe bracts or members of the sterile whorls of the cone. This question\r\nis discussed by Zeiller[887] and Williamson and Scott[888], also more\r\nrecently by Scott[889] in his memoir on _Cheirostrobus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Sphenophyllostachys Römeri_ (Solms-Laubach)[890].\r\n                        Fig. 107, _C_ and _D_.\r\n\r\nIn another type of _Sphenophyllum_ strobilus, recently described\r\nby Solms-Laubach, the incurved end of each sporangiophore bore two\r\nsporangia. In most respects this species, which has not been found in\r\nconnection with a vegetative shoot, agrees with _Sphenophyllostachys\r\nDawsoni_.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 107, _C_, which is copied from one of Solms-Laubach’s\r\ndrawings[891], we have an oblique transverse section of part of a\r\nstrobilus, including portions of two series of sporangia borne on one\r\nverticil of bracts, and at the right-hand edge the section has passed\r\nthrough the sporangia belonging to another whorl of bracts. There\r\nwere probably three concentric series of sporangia attached to each\r\nverticil of bracts, as in the case of fig. 108. The unshaded area,\r\n_b_ (fig. 107, _C_), represents the bracts of two successive sterile\r\nwhorls in transverse section. The shaded areas are the sporangia, with\r\ntheir sporangiophores, _s_. The relative position of the sporangia and\r\nsporangiophores suggests that each pedicel bore two sporangia at its\r\ntip, instead of one, as in the strobilus of _Sphenophyllum cuneifolium_\r\n(Sternb.).\r\n\r\nA further variation in the structure of the strobili is illustrated by\r\nsome specimens of _S. trichomatosum_ Stur, described by Kidston[892],\r\nfrom the Coal-Measures of Barnsley. Each whorl of bracts bears a single\r\nseries of oval sporangia which appear to be sessile on the basal\r\nportion of the whorl. It is possible that delicate sporangiophores\r\nmay have been present, but in the imperfect examples in Kidston’s\r\ncollection[893] the sporangia present the appearance of being seated\r\ndirectly on the surface of the bracts. As the specimens do not show any\r\ninternal structure, it would be unwise to lay too much stress on the\r\napparent absence of the characteristic sporangiophores. In any case,\r\nKidston’s cones afford an illustration of the occurrence of a single\r\nseries of sporangia in each whorl, instead of the pluriseriate manner\r\nof occurrence in some other species.\r\n\r\nThe statement is occasionally met with that some _Sphenophyllum_ cones\r\npossessed two kinds of spores, but we are still in want of satisfactory\r\nevidence that this was really the case. Renault has described an\r\nimperfect specimen, which he considers points to the heterosporous\r\nnature of a _Sphenophyllum_ cone, but Zeiller and Williamson and Scott\r\nhave expressed doubts as to the correctness of Renault’s conclusions.\r\nWhile admitting the possibility of undoubted heterosporous strobili\r\nbeing discovered, we are not in a position to refer to _Sphenophyllum_\r\nas having borne strobili containing two kinds of spores[894].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPHENOPHYLLUM EMARGINATUM.]\r\n\r\n[The following are some of the specimens in the Williamson Cabinet\r\nwhich illustrate the structure of _Sphenophyllum_:—\r\n\r\n  _S. plurifoliatum._     874, 882, 884, 893, 894, 897, 899, 901, 903,\r\n                            908, 1893.\r\n  _S. insigne._           910, 914, 919, 921, 922, 924, 926, 1420, 1898.\r\n  _Sphenophyllostachys._  1049A–1049C, 1898.]\r\n\r\n\r\n           B.

Kidston, Upper\r\n  Coal-Measures, Radstock. ⅚ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThis species of _Sphenophyllum_ bears verticils of six or eight\r\nwedge-shaped leaves varying in breadth and in the extent of dissection\r\nof the laminae; they are truncated distally, and terminate in a margin\r\ncharacterised by blunt or obtusely-rounded teeth, each of which\r\nreceives a single vein. The larger leaves are usually more or less\r\ndeeply divided by a median slit. The narrow base of each leaf receives\r\na single vein which branches repeatedly in a dichotomous manner in\r\nthe substance of the lamina. Several drawings have been given by\r\nSterzel[899] in a memoir on Permian plants, showing the variation in\r\nleaf-form in _Sphenophyllum emarginatum_, but as Kidston[900] and\r\nZeiller[901] have pointed out Sterzel’s specimens probably belong to\r\n_S. cuneifolium_ (Sternb.).\r\n\r\nBranches are given off singly from the nodes, and the cones are borne\r\nat the tips of branches or branchlets. The cone of _S. emarginatum_\r\nagrees very closely with that of _S. cuneifolium_, and is of the same\r\ntype as that shown in fig. 108. The small branch of _S. emarginatum_\r\nrepresented in fig. 109 does not show clearly the detailed characters\r\nof the species, as the leaf-margins are not well preserved.\r\n\r\nIn one of the largest specimens of this species which I have seen, in\r\nthe Leipzig Museum, the main stem has internodes of about 3·9 cm. in\r\nlength, from which a lateral branch with much shorter internodes is\r\ngiven off from a node.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice the close resemblance, as pointed out by\r\nZeiller, between some of the narrower-leaved forms of _S. emarginatum_\r\nand _S. cuneifolium_ (Sternb.)[902]; but in the latter species the\r\nmargins of the leaves have sharp, and not blunt teeth.\r\n\r\nThe cone described and figured by Weiss[903] as _Bowmanites\r\ngermanicus_, since investigated by Solms-Laubach[904], must be referred\r\nto this species. Geinitz[905] figured a cone in 1855 as that of\r\n_S. emarginatum_, but his determination of the species is a little\r\ndoubtful. Good figures of the true cone of _S. emarginatum_ have been\r\ngiven by Zeiller[906] in his _Flore de Valenciennes_, as well as in his\r\nimportant memoir on the fructification of _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEAVES.]\r\n\r\n         2. _Sphenophyllum trichomatosum_ Stur. Fig. 110, _B_.\r\n\r\nThe finely-divided leaves of the single whorl shown in fig. 110, _B_\r\n(from the Middle Coal-Measures of Barnsley, Yorkshire), afford an\r\nexample of a form of _Sphenophyllum_ which is represented by such\r\nspecies as _S. tenerrimum_ Ett.[907], _S. trichomatosum_ Stur[908],\r\nand _S. myriophyllum_[909] Crép. Probably the specimen should be\r\nreferred to _S. trichomatosum_, but it is almost impossible to speak\r\nwith certainty as to the specific value of an isolated leaf-whorl of\r\nthis form. It has long been known that the leaves of _Sphenophyllum_\r\nmay vary considerably, as regards the size of the segments, on the\r\nsame plant; and the occurrence of such finely-divided leaves has\r\nlent support to an opinion which was formerly held by some writers,\r\nthat _Asterophyllites_ and _Sphenophyllum_ could not be regarded as\r\nwell-defined separate genera. This heterophylly of _Sphenophyllum_\r\nhas thus been responsible for certain mistaken opinions both as to\r\nthe relation of the genus to _Calamocladus_[910] (_Asterophyllites_),\r\nand as regards the view that the finely-divided laminae belonged\r\nto submerged leaf-whorls, while the broader segments were those of\r\nfloating or subaerial whorls.\r\n\r\nThere is a very close resemblance between some of the deeply-cut and\r\nlinear segments of a _Sphenophyllum_ and the leaves of _Calamocladus_,\r\nbut in the former genus the linear segments are found to be connected\r\nbasally into a narrow common sheath. The assertion[911] that the\r\ndeeply-cut leaves occur on the lower portions of stems is not supported\r\nby the facts. Kidston[912] has pointed out that the cones are often\r\nborne on branches with such leaves, and the same author refers to a\r\nfigure by Germar, in which entire and much-divided leaves occur mixed\r\ntogether in the same individual specimen. M. Zeiller recently pointed\r\nout to me a similar irregular association of broader and narrower\r\nleaf-segments on the same shoots in some large specimens in the École\r\ndes Mines, Paris. Cones of _Sphenophyllum tenerrimum_ have been figured\r\nby Stur[913] and others; they are characterised by their small size\r\nand by the dissection of the slender free portions of the narrow\r\nbracts[914].\r\n\r\n\r\n             3. _Sphenophyllum Thoni_ Mahr. Fig. 110, _A_.\r\n\r\nAnother type of _Sphenophyllum_ is illustrated by _S. Thoni_ Mahr as\r\nshown in fig. 110, _A_. This species was first described by Mahr[915]\r\nfrom the Coal-Measures of Ilmenau, and has since been figured by\r\nZeiller and other authors. Each whorl consists of six large obcuneiform\r\nleaves with the broad margin somewhat irregularly fringed. The\r\nunusually good specimen of which fig. 110, _A_, represents a single\r\nverticil was originally described and figured by Zeiller in 1880[916];\r\nit is now in the École des Mines Museum, Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.\r\n\r\n  _A._ _Sphenophyllum Thoni_, Mahr. (After Zeiller.)\r\n  _B._ _Sphenophyllum trichomatosum_, Stur. From a specimen in the\r\n      Woodwardian Museum; from the Coal-Measures of Barnsley, Yorks.\r\n      _A_ and _B_ ¾ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe leaf-forms illustrated by figs. 109 and 110 are some of the more\r\nextreme types of _Sphenophyllum_ leaves; but these are more or less\r\nconnected by a series of intermediate forms. For a more complete\r\nsystematic account of the different species the student should consult\r\nsuch works as those by Coemans and Kickx[917], Zeiller, Schimper, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n            4. _Sphenophyllum speciosum_ (Royle). Fig. 111.\r\n\r\n                1834. _Trizygia speciosa_, Royle[918].\r\n\r\nThe species shown in fig. 111 has been usually described as a separate\r\ngenus _Trizygia_, a name instituted by Royle in 1834 for some Indian\r\nfossils from the Lower Gondwana rocks of India[919]. Zeiller[920] has\r\nlately pointed out the advisability of including this Asiatic type in\r\nthe genus _Sphenophyllum_. The slender stem bears verticils of cuneate\r\nleaves in three pairs at each node, the anterior pair being smaller\r\nthan the two lateral pairs. The characteristic _Sphenophyllum_ venation\r\nis clearly seen in the enlarged leaf, fig. 111, _B_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111. _Sphenophyllum speciosum_ (Royle).\r\n  _A._ Nat. size. _B._ enlarged leaf.\r\n  From the Raniganj Coal-field, India. (After Feistmantel.)]\r\n\r\nThe inequality of the members of a single whorl, which characterises\r\nthis Indian plant, is sometimes met with in European species. A\r\nspecimen of _Sphenophyllum oblongifolium_, which Prof. Zeiller showed\r\nme in illustration of this point, was practically indistinguishable\r\nfrom _Trizygia_[921].\r\n\r\nIn some of the earlier descriptions of the Indian species the generic\r\nname _Sphenophyllum_[922] was used by McClelland and others, but the\r\nsupposed difference in the leaf-whorls was made the ground of reverting\r\nto the distinct generic term _Trizygia_. Now that a similar type of\r\nleaf-whorl is known to occur in _Sphenophyllum_, it is better to adopt\r\nthat genus rather than to allow the question of locality to unduly\r\ninfluence the choice of a separate generic name for an Indian plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GEOLOGICAL RANGE.]\r\n\r\n           C. Affinities, range and habit of Sphenophyllum.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out in the description of _Sphenophyllum_, that\r\nthe most widely separated families of recent plants have been selected\r\nby different authors as the nearest living allies of this Palaeozoic\r\ngenus. It is now generally admitted that _Sphenophyllum_ is a generic\r\ntype apart; it cannot be classed in any family or sub-class of recent\r\nor fossil plants, without considerably extending or modifying the\r\nrecognised characteristics of existing divisions of the plant-kingdom.\r\nThe anatomical characters of the _Sphenophyllum_ stem are such as one\r\nfinds in some recent genera of the Lycopodineae, especially _Psilotum_.\r\nIf the stele of _Psilotum_ were composed internally of a solid\r\nstrand of xylem, we should have a close correspondence between the\r\ncentripetally-developed wood of this genus and that of _Sphenophyllum_.\r\nSimilar comparisons might be drawn with other existing genera, but the\r\nmore detailed consideration of the affinities of the Palaeozoic plant\r\nwill be more easily dealt with after other members of the Pteridophytes\r\nhave been described. The recent discovery of an entirely new type of\r\nCarboniferous strobilus in rocks of Calciferous sandstone age on the\r\nshores of the Firth of Forth has thrown new light on the position of\r\n_Sphenophyllum_. _Cheirostrobus Pettycurensis_, the new cone which\r\nScott has described in an able memoir, affords certain points of\r\ncontact with _Sphenophyllum_ on the one hand and with _Calamites_ on\r\nthe other. This important question will be dealt with after we have\r\ngiven an account of _Cheirostrobus_[923]. To put the matter shortly,\r\n_Sphenophyllum_ agrees with some Lycopodinous plants in its anatomical\r\nfeatures; with the Equisetales it is connected by the verticillate\r\ndisposition of the leaves, and some of the forms of _Sphenophyllum_\r\nstrobili present features which also point to Equisetinous affinities.\r\n\r\nIn his Presidential address to the Botanical Section at the\r\nBritish Association Meeting of 1896 Scott[924] thus refers to the\r\nSphenophyllums:—“We may hazard the guess that this interesting group\r\nmay have been derived from some unknown form lying at the root of both\r\nCalamites and Lycopods. The existence of the Sphenophyllae certainly\r\nsuggests the probability of a common origin for these two series.” The\r\nresult of the subsequent investigation of the new cone _Cheirostrobus_\r\namply justifies this opinion as to the position of _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that _Sphenophyllum_ lived during the Devonian period,\r\nbut the unsatisfactory specimens on which Dawson has founded a species\r\nof this age, _S. antiquum_[925], can hardly be said to afford positive\r\nevidence of the Pre-Carboniferous existence of the genus. From the\r\nCulm rocks and other strata older than the Coal-Measures, we have\r\nsuch species as _S. insigne_ (Will.), _Sphenophyllostachys Römeri_\r\n(Solms-Laubach), and _Sphenophyllum tenerrimum_, Ett.[926] while _S.\r\nemarginatum_[5], Brongn. occurs in the Upper Coal-Measures and in the\r\nTransition rocks. _S. cuneifolium_[927] (Sternb.) has been recorded\r\nfrom the Transition, Middle and Lower Coal-Measures. _Sphenophyllum\r\noblongifolium_, Germ.[928], is recorded from Lower Permian rocks, as is\r\nalso _S. Thoni_[929], Mahr.\r\n\r\nThe comparison which has naturally been drawn between _Sphenophyllum_\r\nwith its slender stems bearing occasionally dimorphic leaves, and\r\nwater-plants is not, I believe, supported by the facts of anatomy\r\nor external characters. The entire and finely-dissected leaves\r\ndo not exhibit that regularity of relative disposition which is\r\ncharacteristic of aquatic plants; the two forms of leaves may occur\r\nindiscriminately on the same branch. The well-developed and thick xylem\r\nis not in accordance with the anatomical features usually associated\r\nwith water-plants. It is true that in some living dicotyledons of the\r\nfamily Leguminosae, which inhabit swampy places, the secondary xylem is\r\nrepresented by a thick mass of unlignified and thin-walled parenchyma,\r\nas in the genus _Aeschynomene_[930], from which the material of\r\n‘pith’-helmets is obtained; but the wood of _Sphenophyllum_ was\r\nobviously thick-walled and thoroughly lignified.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the long and slender stems of this plant may\r\nhave grown like small lianas in the Coal-Measure forests, supporting\r\nthemselves to a large extent on the stouter branches of Calamites\r\nand other trees. The anatomical structure of a _Sphenophyllum_ stem\r\nwould seem to be in accord with the requirements of a climbing plant.\r\nIt has been shewn[931] that in recent climbing plants the tracheae\r\nand sieve-tubes are characterised by their large diameter, a fact\r\nwhich may be correlated with the small diameter of climbing stems and\r\nthe need for rapid transport of food material. In _Sphenophyllum_\r\nthe tracheae of the xylem have a wide bore, and in _S. insigne_ the\r\nphloem contains unusually wide sieve-tubes. The central position of\r\nthe stele is another feature which is not inconsistent with a climbing\r\nhabit. Schwendener and others[932] have demonstrated that in climbing\r\norgans, as in underground stems and roots, there is a tendency towards\r\na centripetal concentration of mechanical or strengthening tissue.\r\nThe axial xylem strand of _Sphenophyllum_ would afford an efficient\r\nresistance to the tension or pulling force which climbing stems\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                LIST OF WORKS REFERRED TO IN THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adamson, S.
