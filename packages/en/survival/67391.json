C. GILBERT\r\n                            New Haven, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WEATHER INDICATIONS\r\n                         A Study of the Weather\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the minds of most people a very silly notion prevails about the\r\nweather and the weather man. They have a general impression that the\r\nweather knows no laws—that it is lawless and reckless, fickle and\r\nchangeable; that the weather man is a sort of conjurer, and by some\r\nmysterious gift he is able to prophesy things that most people know\r\nnothing about. Nothing could be further from the truth.\r\n\r\nAfter you have carried out the simple experiments described, and have\r\nread this text, whether you have a scientific trend of mind or not, you\r\nwill at least learn that the weather is a science, like electricity,\r\nchemistry, or medicine; that its laws are uniform, constant, and\r\nunchanging, and there is really nothing mysterious about it. The weather\r\nman is a scientist and by means of instruments, which indicate certain\r\nthings, he comes to definite conclusions. He is not a prophet; he does\r\nnot prophesy; he forecasts.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in having a Weather Bureau station of your own,\r\nyou will find it one of the most interesting things you ever acquired in\r\nyour life. You will soon gain a knowledge of a subject that most people\r\nare quite ignorant of, and if you desire to stand for leadership among\r\nyour boy friends, it may be achieved by knowing about those things that\r\nto most boys, and in fact to adults, assume a mysterious and magical\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nA Weather Bureau station at your home will give you a source of\r\npleasure, fun, and insight into a science that is intensely interesting,\r\neasy to understand, fascinating and worth while knowing. The importance\r\nof the subject cannot be overestimated. It has an influence on the whole\r\nworld; it affects our health; it affects our comfort; it means success\r\nor failure in farming; it has an immense influence upon transportation.\r\nWhen ready to move perishable goods, the transporter must have\r\nindications of what the weather is going to be.\r\n\r\nThe weather observer is the guardian angel of the ships at sea; some men\r\nhave doubts as to whether medicine itself has saved more human lives\r\nthan the study of the weather and the practice of weather observing. It\r\nis not unusual for those who live along the coast to see ships hovering\r\ninto cover long before a storm approaches, for the wonderful weather\r\nbureau system operated by the United States Government gives warnings\r\nand danger signals all over the country. Statistics show that losses\r\nhave been reduced seventy-five to eighty per cent through this system.\r\nThe marine warnings are so perfect, so prompt, and so efficient that for\r\na great many years no long or hard storms have ever reached any part of\r\nthe United States without advance warnings and danger signals being\r\nshown beforehand.\r\n\r\nWhen a storm is brewing, the Government’s wonderful Weather Bureau\r\norganization watches every atmospheric change with the greatest care and\r\nconcern, and takes observations every few hours, and telegraphs the\r\nindications to all places where a warning should be given. Thereby\r\nperishable goods that need protection can be looked after. When extra\r\nhazardous storms and weather changes of a severe character are\r\nindicated, hundreds of thousands of telegrams are sent out in a\r\ncomparatively short time, to all parts of the country, so that\r\ninterested parties may prepare for such conditions. One can readily see\r\nthe great service rendered and the satisfaction it must be to the\r\nshipper and the farmer to know that his property, which might be\r\ndestroyed by a bad storm or low temperature, is being constantly and\r\ncarefully guarded against danger. Not only storms and great cold waves\r\nhave been forecasted, but floods have been anticipated and warnings\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a study of the subject “Weather,” and the best way to\r\nlearn about the weather is to first learn about the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE AIR\r\n\r\nIf you were to ask ninety-nine people out of a hundred to take the\r\nstopper out of a bottle, to look into it, and to smell its contents, and\r\nthen ask them if, in their opinion, it contained anything, the\r\ninvariable answer would be: “It contains nothing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENT NO. 1\r\n\r\nTake the stopper out of a bottle and endeavor to pour water into it\r\nrapidly and see what happens. (See Fig. 1.) One of the laws in Physics\r\nis that no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time. After\r\ndoing this experiment, you will come to the conclusion that the bottle\r\ndoes contain something, and that “something” is matter, and that matter\r\nis air. There is in the bottle probably as important a thing as you\r\ncould possibly conceive of, because even this earth without its ocean of\r\nair would be a world of desolation; for air sustains life itself, and\r\nwhen agitated, develops great strength. It may be whirled about into a\r\nhurricane blast and assume such violent proportions that villages will\r\nbe swept away, and great waves of water will be raised, upon which ships\r\ncan be tossed about like so much chaff. We all know that air can become\r\nso cold that great suffering will be caused, and so hot that it will\r\nmake life almost unbearable. We really live in an ocean of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE OCEAN OF AIR\r\n\r\nAs the fishes live at the bottom of the ocean of water, mankind lives at\r\nthe bottom of an “ocean of air.” (See Fig. 2.) No one is absolutely\r\ncertain about the depth of this air, but it has been estimated as low as\r\nforty miles and as high as two hundred miles. Balloons have gone up to a\r\nheight of nearly nineteen miles (100,320 feet). We do know that the\r\nhigher we go, the thinner the air becomes. It is practically impossible\r\nfor man to ascend into the air more than five or six miles, owing to the\r\nfact that the air above that height is so thin that there is not enough\r\nto breathe. Naturally, the air at the bottom is more compact because of\r\nthe vast amount of air above. The air is a great weight lying upon\r\nus—14.7 pounds per square inch of surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n             HOW TO PROVE BY EXPERIMENT THAT AIR HAS WEIGHT\r\n\r\nThe air-globe is a piece of apparatus for demonstrating that air has\r\nweight. (See Fig. 3.) First, the air-globe is weighed and then the air\r\nis pumped into it; its stop-cock is closed and the globe is reweighed.\r\nIt will be found to have gained in weight. This is conclusive that air\r\nis matter and that it has weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf great importance to us in the study is the next fact, that air exerts\r\npressure on everything about us and upon ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENT NO. 2\r\n\r\nA tumbler is filled with water and a piece of paper placed over the top\r\nof it. The glass is then inverted, holding the hand over the paper so\r\nthat none of the water will come out. On taking the hand away, although\r\nthe glass of water is inverted, the contents do not leave the glass.\r\n(See Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIt demonstrates that the air is exerting a pressure from below on the\r\npaper, which is more than enough to support the weight of the water. The\r\ntumbler may be placed in any position and yet the water will stay in.\r\nThis air pressure is exerted alike from all directions, and this\r\npressure, which is 14.7 pounds to the square inch, is weighed down by\r\nthe air about it and may be likened very much to ordinary water in that\r\nit exerts pressure in all directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENT NO. 3\r\n\r\nTake an ordinary rubber sucker, such as is used on the end of a dart,\r\nand attach it to a string. Force this down on a piece of glass. (See\r\nFig. 5.) The glass can then by lifted by the pressure of the air that\r\nholds the rubber to it.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a German experimental philosopher named Otto Von\r\nGuericke for knowledge of atmospheric pressure. Guericke is\r\ndistinguished by his original discoveries of the properties of the air.\r\nHe was born at Magdeburg in Prussian Saxony, November 20, 1602. He\r\nbecame interested at an early age in the politics of his city, and in\r\n1627 was elected alderman, and in 1646 Mayor of Magdeburg. While serving\r\nin the above capacities, he devoted his leisure to science, especially\r\non the creation of a vacuum and the action of bodies in a vacuum. His\r\nfirst experiments were conducted with a pump on a barrel of water. After\r\ndrawing off all the water, he still found that air permeated the wood of\r\nthe barrel, so he substituted a globe of copper and pumped out air also.\r\nHe thus became the inventor of the air pump and illustrated in a simple\r\nbut effective way the force of atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 6\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy placing two hollow hemispheres of copper (see Fig. 6) together, and\r\nexhausting the air, he found that fifteen horses pulling one way and\r\nfifteen pulling the opposite were unable to pull the hemispheres apart.\r\n\r\nHe further demonstrated that in a vacuum all bodies fall equally fast,\r\nthat animals cannot exist therein, or, in fact, living matter. He is\r\nalso credited with being the inventor of the air balance and a type of\r\nweather cock, called the anemoscope. He was interested also in\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 7\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENT NO. 4\r\n\r\nThis experiment should interest you very much, because it is going to\r\nlead up to the subject of weather instruments, and is absolutely\r\nessential that you understand the fundamental principles in order to\r\nintelligently interpret these instruments. This experiment will explain\r\none of the principles of the barometer.\r\n\r\nTake a glass tube thirty-two inches long and one-quarter or one-eighth\r\ninch in diameter, and fill it with mercury, care being used to get rid\r\nof all the air bubbles. The mercury should be poured in with an eye\r\ndropper, one end of the tube being sealed, until filled, and then the\r\nfinger is placed over the open end. (See Fig. 7A). The tube is inverted\r\nand immersed in a reservoir of mercury and clamped to an upright stand.\r\nImmediately the mercury falls to about thirty inches. (See Fig. 7B). Ask\r\nyourself what held the mercury up in the tube. Again the answer is that\r\nthe pressure of the air on the mercury in the reservoir causes it to\r\nrise and fall in the tube, as the pressure of the air changes. You will\r\nsoon learn what causes these changes in the pressure of the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 8\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENT NO. 5\r\n\r\nHave you ever asked yourself why it is that the wind blows? Why doesn’t\r\nit stand still?\r\n\r\nPut your hand over a lamp chimney under which the lamp is lighted. You\r\nwill soon discover that the heat is rising. Four things in connection\r\nwith this are of great importance:\r\n\r\n  1. Air has weight.\r\n\r\n  2. When heated, it rises.\r\n\r\n  3. Air expands when heated.\r\n\r\n  4. Warm air will gather and hold more moisture than cold air.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENT NO. 6\r\n\r\nCut a piece of stiff cardboard in a spiral shape. Thread a piece of\r\nthread through a pinhole in the center point of the spiral and fasten\r\nthis to a support so that it swings freely in the air. (See Fig. 8.)\r\nUnder this put a little alcohol lamp, or put it over a gas jet or\r\nradiator.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WHAT HAPPENS\r\n\r\nThe cardboard will spin around rapidly. Ask yourself what causes this.\r\nIt is the force of the hot air rising which caused the spiral cardboard\r\nto turn in such an attractive manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENT NO. 7\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 9\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen you are in a warm room, find out which air is the hottest, that in\r\nthe upper or that in the lower part of the room. This answer you can get\r\nby placing the thermometer low down in the room and then putting it up\r\nnear the ceiling. This is another conclusive proof that hot air rises.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment that is quite familiar to all of us is that of\r\nopening the windows of a heated room a few inches top and bottom, and\r\nholding a lighted match or smoke paper at the bottom, when you will find\r\nthat it blows the flame or smoke inward. Then put it near the top of the\r\nwindow and it will be drawn out. The same answer is true; the cold air\r\nis rushing in from below to take the place of the hot air rising and\r\ngoing out at the top. (See Fig. 9.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 10\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENT NO. 8\r\n\r\nThis experiment is even more important than the preceding one, and you\r\nshould by all means do it, for it is going to prove more conclusively\r\nthan anything else what causes the wind, and in miniature it is a real\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nPlace a little alcohol lamp on the table, or a wax candle will do. Over\r\nthis place an ordinary lamp chimney, lifting it a short distance off the\r\ntable, and it can be held in position by any little object. (See Fig.\r\n10.) Over the chimney hold some smoke paper. (Smoke paper is nothing\r\nmore than filter paper, or brown wrapping paper of a soft texture.) From\r\nthe experiments already visualized to you, you should know what to\r\nexpect. You will again see that the heated air is rising; it has\r\nexpanded and become light. Now what becomes of the air that is rising\r\nand where does it go? In doing this experiment be careful not to make\r\nany unnatural movements that will change the current of wind. Stand\r\nperfectly still so that the experiment will be perfect, because you are\r\nnow producing in miniature a real storm, or demonstrating the cause of\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThe next observation—what happens at the bottom of the chimney? Here you\r\nwill find the outside air is coming in, the same as it did in the window\r\nexperiment. Particularly, notice however, that the smoke enters\r\nunderneath the chimney from all directions, and the smoke paper should\r\nbe moved away from the glass chimney to determine the distance at which\r\nthe smoke flames will still be drawn into the chimney.\r\n\r\nYou now produced for yourself in miniature a storm and wind. The air\r\nthat has been heated rises over a heated area, and cooler air from all\r\ndirections around is passing into the space underneath the chimney and\r\ntaking the place of the heated air that has gone up. This experiment\r\nillustrates what takes place, except on a smaller scale, out in the\r\natmosphere when a portion of the earth becomes heated. If this is clear\r\nto you, it will help you to understand the main principles underlying\r\nstorms and winds, which will be given later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EXPERIMENT NO. 9\r\n\r\nEqually important is the last part of the experiment, which consists in\r\nlifting the lamp chimney off the table altogether and continuing with\r\nthe smoke paper. Note results that you get now. The smoke will spread\r\nout over a large area.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WHAT IS THE WEATHER?\r\n\r\nBy the weather we mean the temperature, the amount of moisture in the\r\nair, the pressure of the air, the movement of the air, and all the\r\nconditions that have to do with the atmosphere, such as heat, cold,\r\nrain, snow, sleet, fog, frost, dew, etc. It has to do with everything,\r\nfrom calmness and clearness to cloudiness and blizzards.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE EFFECT OF THE SUN\r\n\r\nThe sun has a great deal to do with the regulation of the weather. Its\r\nheat causes evaporation; it is the rays of the sun that raises the vapor\r\nfrom the water and brings it into the air; it is the cooling of this\r\nvapor that produces the rain, hail and sleet storms, and its brilliancy\r\ncauses a difference in air pressure at times. It is this difference in\r\nair pressure that produces winds, as you will learn later.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HUMIDITY\r\n\r\nThe state of the air with respect to the vapor that it contains is\r\ncalled its humidity. The humidity is said to be high when the air is\r\ndamp, and low when the air is dry. Humidity and moisture in the air are\r\nimportant factors about the weather. It is lack of humidity that has\r\nmore to do with poor health, colds, and catarrh than anything else. The\r\nimportance of proper humidity in houses and buildings cannot be\r\nemphasized too greatly. Proper humidity will save twelve and one-half\r\nper cent in the cost of heating. The great majority of people are under\r\nthe impression that colds are caused by sudden change in temperature,\r\nbut the most colds are actually caused by stuffy, hot rooms. The reason\r\nthat some people complain that 70° is not hot enough is because the\r\nhumidity is too low, but if the moisture is brought into the air at a\r\nproper degree, the humidity is maintained. You will find that 68° will\r\nbe a proper temperature to maintain in a room. The reason for this is\r\nthat the air in the room is dry and the heat actually goes through it.\r\nIn other words, it does not warm it; moist air stops radiation.\r\nConsequently, the result is that it warms it. In other words, moisture\r\nis nothing more than clothing, and this accounts for the fact that in a\r\nhot room, where there is no moisture, we heat our rooms beyond the\r\ndegree that is necessary in order to feel any reasonable amount of\r\ncomfort. Dry air allows too much radiation from the body and too rapid\r\nevaporation, which makes us cold.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment illustrates the above statement. Place a few\r\ndrops of water on a smooth surface, such as a table top or ordinary\r\nboard, and over this a watch glass, containing a small quantity of\r\nether. In order to hasten evaporation, blow a current of air across it,\r\nand it will be found that the glass will be frozen to the board. This is\r\ncaused by the evaporation of the ether, which uses up heat.\r\n\r\nYou know a great many times when you go out into the wind how cold it\r\nfeels, and yet if the wind would actually stop, you would think it warm.\r\nIt is the wind that causes the rapid evaporation and makes the surface\r\nof the skin feel cold. As it is true that the moisture in the air acts\r\nas a blanket to us in our homes, it is likewise as true that the vapor\r\nin its natural form outside of the house acts as a blanket for the\r\nearth. Do you realize that without this blanket we would burn up in the\r\nsummer and freeze to death in the winter?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  FOGS\r\n\r\nWater vapor in the air is transparent, but when this water vapor becomes\r\ncooled, a portion of it becomes precipitated, which is no more or less\r\nthan drops of water that are extremely small, but yet large enough to\r\nbecome transparent, and the atmosphere in this state is called fog. In\r\nreality, fogs are nothing more than clouds near the surface of the\r\nearth. When the ground is at a higher temperature than the air, it\r\nproduces fogs. They are also produced when a current of moist air and a\r\ncurrent of hot air pass over a body of water at a lower temperature.\r\nConsequently, you can easily see that fog will never form when it is\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  HAIL\r\n\r\nAfter rain drops have been formed and they freeze in their passage\r\nthrough the air, they then become hailstones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  SNOW\r\n\r\nWhen condensation of vapor in the air takes place at a temperature below\r\n32° F., a deposit is made in a solid condition, either in the form of\r\nsnow or hail. Snow is made up of crystals, most of which have great\r\nbeauty. Everyone should observe either by the naked eye or by a\r\nmagnifying glass the little crystals caught before they are broken. When\r\nyou see extremely large snowflakes in the sky, you can be sure the\r\ntemperature is very near freezing, for at this point the flakes are more\r\nor less damp and the snow is heavy and wet. Now if there is a slight\r\nwind, the crystals become broken and separate flakes unite to form large\r\nmasses of snow. Generally speaking, ten inches of snow makes one inch of\r\nrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  DEW\r\n\r\nIf the temperature of the ground falls below the dew point of the air,\r\nthe air deposits on the cooler surface moisture in the form of small\r\ndrops of water, which we call dew drops. Where the temperature of the\r\nground becomes cooler than the air above it, a rapid cooling by\r\nradiation on a clear night has taken place; and if the dew point or\r\nfrost point has been reached by the ground, the air just above the point\r\nis several degrees warmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FROST\r\n\r\nWhen the moisture in the air that is in contact with the earth is\r\ncondensed above the freezing point, dew is formed. When below the\r\nfreezing point, frost is formed or deposited on the earth. It is readily\r\nunderstood from this that the surface on which the frost is deposited is\r\nat a freezing temperature, while the air above it may not be freezing.\r\nNaturally, you can expect frost when the temperature falls to a point 8°\r\nor 10° above the freezing point. Clear, calm nights are favorable for\r\nfrost, because the absence of clouds helps radiation, that is, it draws\r\nheat away from the earth. If there are clouds, it prevents this\r\nradiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THUNDER AND LIGHTNING\r\n\r\nFree electricity is always in the air. During clear weather it is\r\ngenerally positive; during cloudy weather it is negative. This\r\nelectricity is carried in the air by the moisture. As dry air is a\r\nnon-conductor of electricity, in fair weather the electrified particles\r\nof air are insulated and therefore acquire very little intensity. The\r\nclouds having been formed and being filled with moisture, form an\r\nexcellent conductor of electricity, which acquires considerable\r\nintensity. It is a well-known physical law that two bodies having\r\nopposite electricities attract each other, and those having like charges\r\nrepel each other. From this, two clouds having opposite charges rush\r\ntogether and produce the phenomena, called lightning, which is\r\naccompanied by an explosion called thunder. Often we see several flashes\r\nof lightning and then hear several thunder crashes, which is caused by\r\nonly one section of a cloud discharging its electricity at a time.\r\n\r\nAs a cloud attracts the opposite charge of electricity from the surface\r\nof the earth beneath it by inductive influence, often we see a discharge\r\nof electricity from the cloud to the earth, the charge usually being\r\nreceived by such objects as hills, trees, church spires, high buildings,\r\netc. Bodies containing large quantities of moisture are susceptible to\r\nstrokes of lightning, as the moisture causes them to become good\r\nconductors of electricity. Also trees on the outer edge of a forest are\r\nmore liable to be struck than those farther in.\r\n\r\nThere are several forms of lightning, such as zigzag, ball, sheet, and\r\nheat lightning.\r\n\r\nZigzag lightning, as the name implies, follows an irregular course,\r\nproducing a long zigzag line of light, sometimes ten miles in length,\r\nand is caused by the air producing a field of resistance to the path of\r\nelectricity, causing it to seek a path of less resistance.\r\n\r\nBall lightning appears like a large ball of fire, usually accompanied by\r\na terrific explosion. This is the result of the bodies being charged\r\nwith electricity of great intensity, and travels in a straight path, as\r\nit has enough strength to oppose any resistance placed in its path.\r\n\r\nHeat lightning is usually seen on warm evenings, especially during the\r\nsummer, and very often unaccompanied by thunder, due to the great\r\ndistance of the lightning clouds from where we are located, thus\r\ndiminishing the intensity of the thunder. The electricity of the clouds\r\nescape in flashes so feeble as to produce no audible sound.\r\n\r\nSheet lightning is a diffused glare of light sometimes illuminating only\r\nthe edges of a cloud, and again spreading over its entire surface.\r\n\r\nOrdinary flashes of lightning last but the minutest part of a second.\r\n\r\nThunder is the re-entrance of air into an empty space. The vacuum is\r\ncreated by the lightning in its passage through the air. The violence of\r\nthunder varies according to the intensity of the electrical flashes.\r\n\r\nBecause of the fact that light is transmitted almost instantaneously,\r\nwhile sound travels at a speed of eleven hundred feet per second, the\r\nsound will not reach the ear for some few seconds after the flash of\r\nlightning. Average space of time between a flash and a report is about\r\ntwelve seconds. The longest interval is seventy-two seconds and the\r\nshortest one second. Prolonged peals of thunder are, in some cases, due\r\nto the effect of echoes. These peals are especially noticeable in\r\nmountainous countries. The echoes are also produced by the reflection of\r\nsound from the clouds.\r\n\r\nThunder storms are distributed over certain sections of the globe,\r\noccurring most frequently in the equatorial regions and diminishing as\r\nwe approach the polar regions. Within the tropics, where there are trade\r\nwinds, thunder storms are rare. Thunder storms are common in warm\r\nclimates because evaporation supplies electricity in great abundance,\r\nand thus precipitation of the air is brought about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 11\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TORNADOES\r\n\r\nTornadoes are caused by the air becoming abnormally heated over certain\r\nareas. Likewise, caused by a difference in pressure. Tornadoes are local\r\nwhirlwinds of great energy, generally formed within thunder storms. They\r\nare most easily distinguished by a funnel-shaped cloud that hangs from\r\nthe bottom of the larger thunder cloud mass above it. The funnel is\r\nformed around a violent ascending mass of whirling winds; its diameter\r\nsometimes reaching several hundred feet, being larger above than below,\r\nthe winds themselves covering a greater space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 12\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe whirling funnel advances generally to the east or northeast at a\r\nrate of twenty to forty miles an hour, accompanied by a deafening noise,\r\ndestroying everything in its path. The path is usually less than a\r\nquarter of a mile in width.\r\n\r\nThe winds in the vortex (the apparent cavity or vacuum formed in the\r\ncenter of the whirling winds) of the tornado attain an incredible\r\nviolence, and due to this fact houses are shattered, trees uprooted, and\r\nhuman lives lost, besides other devastation of property and animal life.\r\nIt is, therefore, the vorticular whirl that causes the destruction\r\nproduced by tornadoes.\r\n\r\nTornadoes are more frequent in the southern states than anywhere else in\r\nthe country, and occur in the warmer months.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of the whirling winds in a tornado increase towards the\r\ncenter, and it is because of this that the point of danger is only a\r\nsmall distance from the funnel cloud. The direction of the whirling\r\nmotion is from right to left. From the appearance of the funnel formed\r\nin a tornado, it looks as though the currents were descending from the\r\ncloud to the earth, when in reality the currents are ascending. The\r\nascending current draws on the warm and moist air near the surface of\r\nthe earth for its supply, and this inrush of air in a spiral form into\r\nthe low pressure core made by the higher whirl constitutes the\r\ndestructive blast of the tornado.\r\n\r\nTornadoes approach rapidly, and it is therefore almost impossible for\r\nthose who happen to be in their path to escape their violence.\r\n\r\nA tornado at sea is termed a water spout.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RAINFALL\r\n\r\nYou will recall a preceding statement that evaporated humidity turns\r\ninto water when it becomes cool below a certain point. (See page 14,\r\nEffect of the Sun.) A given amount of air will hold a certain amount of\r\nmoisture. For example, let us assume that a cubic foot of air (see Fig.\r\n11) is saturated, that is, it is holding all the water it will retain.\r\nNow if this cubic foot of air is cooled, it will contract, and as a\r\nresult there will not be enough room to hold both the air and moisture,\r\nso the excess moisture will leak out. (See Fig. 12.) The result of this\r\nreduction in temperature causes precipitation, simply because the air\r\ncannot sustain the water that is in it. Therefor, at any time when\r\nmoisture in the air has reached the point of saturation and a chilling\r\ntakes place, due to the air becoming cold, rain follows. This may happen\r\nas a result of air rising into higher places or cooler levels, or\r\nthrough its contact with cooler surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n       WHY WE GET SUCH HEAVY RAINFALLS SOMETIMES AROUND MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nThe air becomes thoroughly saturated. When air is comparatively warm, it\r\nwill expand, and this air, which is heavily saturated is brought up by\r\nbreezes onto the mountain range, which is cold, causing the air to lose\r\nits heat and contract and really force the water out of the air. The\r\nsame principle applies to sea breezes bringing rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 WINDS\r\n\r\nWinds are caused as a result of differences in temperature between the\r\nvarious layers of the atmosphere. A certain amount of air becomes heated\r\nand rises, and as explained before, expands. As the air expands, it\r\nbecomes lighter, and because it is light it goes upward toward higher\r\nregions. It also flows from hot to cold countries. A good illustration\r\nof this is the sea breezes. If you have lived around the seashore in the\r\nsummer time, you will have observed that during the hot part of the day\r\nthe winds generally blow from the sea toward the land. At night the\r\ndirection of the wind is reversed, that is, it blows from the land to\r\nthe sea. Why? Because the land during the day retains its heat, while\r\nthe water diffuses it. What is the result? The air on the land expands,\r\nbecomes light. The air over the water being cool, it does not expand,\r\nand the result is that it presses toward the land. At night the land\r\nloses its heat more rapidly than the water, so that it is not long\r\nbefore the land is cooler than the water, and when this happens, the air\r\nover the land, which has become cooler, presses seaward.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             KINDS OF WINDS\r\n\r\n=Mountain Breezes=: Caused by the heating and cooling of the hills and\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\n=Avalanche Winds=: Winds that are in front of a landslide, caused by the\r\nmovement of the snow forcing the air in front of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 13\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 14\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 15\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 16\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 17\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Volcanic Winds=: Due to volcanic eruption, which produces an outrush of\r\nair.\r\n\r\n=A Squall=: Due to the sudden disturbance in temperature.\r\n\r\n=A Simoon=: A desert wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VELOCITY OF WIND\r\n\r\nThe wind blows a great deal harder on water than on land, because on\r\nland it meets with various obstacles, whereas it has very little\r\nfriction on the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE FORCE OF THE WINDS\r\n\r\n       Wind blowing at 20 miles per hour has a force of  1¼ lbs.\r\n       Wind blowing at 35 miles per hour has a force of  6 lbs.\r\n       Wind blowing at 50 miles per hour has a force of 13 lbs.\r\n       Wind blowing at 75 miles per hour has a force of 28 lbs.\r\n       Wind blowing at 90 miles per hour has a force of 40 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DAY SIGNALS\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 18\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 19\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 20\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 21\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 22\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 23\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NIGHT SIGNALS\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 19A\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 20A\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 21A\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 22A\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 23A\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NAME OF WINDS\r\n\r\nBeaufort’s scale, used in preparation of all Weather Bureau wind\r\nforecasts and storm warnings.\r\n\r\n        FORCE        DESIGNATION            MILES PER HOUR\r\n            0 Calm                           From       0 to  3\r\n            1 Light Air                      Over       3 to  8\r\n            2 Light breeze (or wind)          „         8 „  13\r\n            3 Gentle breeze (or wind)         „        13 „  18\r\n            4 Moderate breeze (or wind)       „        18 „  23\r\n            5 Fresh breeze (or wind)          „        23 „  28\r\n            6 Strong breeze (or wind)         „        28 „  34\r\n            7 Moderate gale                   „        34 „  40\r\n            8 Fresh gale                      „        40 „  48\r\n            9 Strong gale                     „        48 „  56\r\n           10 Whole gale                      „        56 „  65\r\n           11 Storm                           „        65 „  75\r\n           12 Hurricane                       „        75\r\n\r\nThe following method of transmitting weather signals by means of flags\r\nwas used for a number of years, but the newspapers now convey the same\r\nnews to the interested public:\r\n\r\n1. A square white flag indicates fair weather. (See Fig. 13.)\r\n\r\n2. A square blue flag indicates rain or snow. (See Fig. 14.)\r\n\r\n3. A white and blue flag, half white and half blue, indicates local rain\r\nor snow. (See Fig. 15.)\r\n\r\n4. Black triangular flag indicates a change in temperature. (See Fig.\r\n16.)\r\n\r\n5. White flag with a square black center indicates cold wave. (See Fig.\r\n17.)\r\n\r\nWhen No. 4 is placed above No. 1, 2, or 3, it indicates warmer weather;\r\nwhen below, colder; when not displayed the temperature is expected to\r\nremain stationary.\r\n\r\nThe following flag warnings are used along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts\r\nto notify inhabitants of this section of the country of impending\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n=Fig. 18. The Small Craft Warning.= A red pennant indicates that\r\nmoderately strong winds that will interfere with the safe operation of\r\nsmall craft are expected. No night display of small craft warnings is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n=Fig. 19. The Northeast Storm Warning.= A red pennant above a square red\r\nflag with black center displayed by day, or two red lanterns, one above\r\nthe other, displayed by night (Fig. 19A), indicates the approach of a\r\nstorm of marked violence, with winds beginning from the northeast.\r\n\r\n=Fig. 20. The Southeast Storm Warning.= A red pennant below a square red\r\nflag with black center displayed by day, or one red lantern displayed by\r\nnight (Fig. 20A), indicates the approach of a storm of marked violence\r\nwith winds beginning from the southeast.\r\n\r\n=Fig. 21. The Southwest Storm Warning.= A white pennant below a square\r\nred flag with black center displayed by day, or a white lantern below a\r\nred lantern displayed by night (Fig. 21A), indicates the approach of a\r\nstorm of marked violence, with winds beginning from the southwest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 24\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Fig. 22. The Northwest Storm Warning.= A white pennant above a square\r\nred flag with black center displayed by day, or a white lantern above a\r\nred lantern displayed by night (Fig. 22A), indicates the approach of a\r\nstorm of marked violence, with winds beginning from the northwest.\r\n\r\n=Fig. 23. Hurricane, or Whole Gale Warning.= Two square flags, red with\r\nblack centers, one above the other, displayed by day, or two red\r\nlanterns, with a white lantern between, displayed by night (Fig. 23),\r\nindicate the approach of a tropical hurricane, or of one of the\r\nextremely severe and dangerous storms which occasionally move across the\r\nGreat Lakes and Atlantic Coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 25\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe have installed at our manufacturing plant a high-class weather\r\nstation, with equipment of the latest United States Weather Bureau\r\nstandard pattern, and are able to send out weather signals by wireless\r\nfrom our own wireless station twice daily, at 4 P. M. and 7 P. M., to\r\nall boys owning a wireless outfit. The indications are taken from our\r\nown instruments. A description of these instruments and the method of\r\nrecording the indications will give you an insight into how the various\r\ngovernment weather stations arrive at their forecasts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 26\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the roof of the factory is a weather vane (Fig. 34) twenty feet high,\r\nwhich is connected electrically with a register in our weather office.\r\nThe register is of the quadruple type (Fig. 45), and is capable of\r\nrecording wind direction, wind velocity, rainfall, and sunshine on the\r\nsame form or sheet. Thus, we know the wind direction and can deduce\r\ncertain things relating to the weather. Mounted on the wind vane support\r\nis an anemometer (Fig. 36), an instrument for measuring the velocity of\r\nthe wind. A rain gauge (Fig. 49) on the roof catches the precipitation,\r\nand for every one hundredth of an inch of rainfall, a small tipping\r\nbucket empties its contents into a receiver and a record is made on the\r\nform in the quadruple register.\r\n\r\nThe same pen that records the rainfall also records the number of hours\r\nof sunshine during a day, for it is not a common thing to have rain and\r\nsunshine at the same time.\r\n\r\nA hygrothermograph (Fig. 43) records on a form the temperature and\r\namount of humidity in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA barograph (Fig. 44) records the pressure of the atmosphere. For\r\ndetermining the pressure, we also have a mercurial and aneroid\r\nbarometer, which will be described later on.\r\n\r\nYou can readily see that it is a simple matter to obtain the weather\r\nindications.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 27\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CLOUDS\r\n\r\nThe numberless kinds of clouds makes it quite difficult to describe and\r\narrange them or illustrate them in any manner that makes it easy to\r\nrecognize them. Although some may be recognized from description and\r\nwith a fair amount of observation, you will be able to classify them in\r\ntheir proper place. For instance, the thunder clouds most anyone\r\nrecognizes without any experience whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 28\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are really four simple cloud formations and three compound\r\nformations:\r\n\r\n=1. The Cirrus Cloud.= (Fig. 24.)\r\n\r\nThe Cirrus cloud is always seen high in the sky and at a great\r\nelevation. Its formation is fibrous and it is particularly characterized\r\nfor its many varieties of shapes. It also has a marked delicacy of\r\nsubstance and it is pure white.\r\n\r\n=2. The Cumulus Cloud.= (Fig. 25.)\r\n\r\nThe Cumulus cloud is of moderately low elevation. It is a typical cloud\r\nof a summer day. It may be recognized by little heaps or bushes rising\r\nfrom a horizontal base. In summer-time we are all familiar with the\r\ncumulus clouds rising with the currents of air in huge masses. They form\r\none of the most accurate indications of fair weather when you see them\r\ngradually dissolving. Sometimes these clouds become very large, and,\r\nwhile the texture is generally of a woolly white, naturally, when they\r\nassume such large sizes, they gradually change in color to a darkish\r\ntint.\r\n\r\n=3. The Stratus Cloud.= (Fig. 26.)\r\n\r\nThis is the opposite of the Cirrus cloud, because it hangs the lowest of\r\nall, in gray masses or sheets, with a poorly-defined outline.\r\n\r\n=4. The Nimbus Cloud.= (Fig. 27.)\r\n\r\nAny cloud can be classed as a nimbus cloud from which rain or snow is\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\nOf the Compound Clouds we have:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 29\r\n]\r\n\r\n1. The Cirro-Cumulus Cloud (Fig. 28), which has all the characteristics\r\nof both the Cirrus and the Cumulus. The most characteristic form of this\r\ncloud, and the one most commonly known, is when these clouds form small\r\nround masses, which appear to be cirrus bands broken up and curled up.\r\nThis is what people call the “mackerel” sky.\r\n\r\n2. The Cirro-Stratus Cloud (Fig. 29), which is known when the clouds\r\narrange themselves in thin horizontal layers at a great elevation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 30\r\n]\r\n\r\n3. The Cumulo-Stratus (Fig. 30) is the cumulus and the stratus blended\r\ntogether. Their most remarkable form is in connection with approaching\r\nthunder storms, and are often called thunder heads. They rapidly change\r\ntheir outline and present a beautiful spectacle in the sky at times.\r\n\r\nThe Cirrus, Cirro-Cumulus and Cirro-Stratus are known as the upper\r\nclouds and the others are known as the lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES\r\n\r\nDisturbances of the atmosphere are classified as follows: Cyclonic, or\r\nlow area storms, or anti-cyclonic, or high area storms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 31\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe word “cyclone” to most people immediately means a terrific storm,\r\nwhereas in weather observing the cyclonic storm is not really a cyclone\r\nor hurricane at all. It is a storm with an atmospheric pressure below\r\naverage. Particularly important is the wind that blows about this area,\r\nwhich is always spirally inward, due to the rotation of the earth on its\r\naxis. This is probably why it is given the name of cyclonic storm, for\r\nit bears one of the important characteristics of a real cyclone. As the\r\nwind is deflected and moves into the storm center, it turns to the right\r\nand in the form of a whirlwind, spirally, moves around the storm center.\r\n(See Fig 31.) It is this whirling process that has given it the name,\r\ncyclonic storm.\r\n\r\nAs the air rises over the point of low storm area, or, in other words,\r\nthe area of low pressure, and travels into the atmosphere, it is not\r\npermitted to rise to any great height, because it is always acted upon\r\nby the force of gravity and is being pulled back to earth again. We\r\nassume that because of this fact, this rising air which has been pulled\r\nback to the earth again piles up in certain places, causing the\r\nbarometer to rise. Such a center as this is known as a high barometric\r\ncenter or the anti-cyclonic area. Here the circulation of the air is\r\nexactly opposite to that of the cyclonic area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 32\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe are all more or less acquainted with these anti-cyclonic storms,\r\nbecause in winter these great masses of air rise up from the warm areas,\r\npile up, and form high pressure areas over the mountains of Canada, and\r\nsoon this high pressure works down upon us as blizzards and cold waves.\r\n\r\nWe have described quite minutely the movement of the wind about these\r\npoints of high pressure and low pressure and have shown you the map and\r\nhave illustrated the high pressure and low pressure areas, but there is\r\nstill another feature that is of great importance to us, and that is the\r\nmovement of the storms and the fact that storms have a progressive\r\nmovement from west to east.\r\n\r\nThese storms move more rapidly in the United States than elsewhere, and\r\nare more rapid in their movement in winter than in summer. Their speed\r\nis almost one half again as great. The average velocity of the low area\r\nstorm in the United States is about twenty-five miles an hour in June,\r\nJuly, August, and September, and from October on they continue to\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LOW PRESSURE\r\n\r\nWe can summarize low pressure storms generally in the following manner:\r\nThey have a wind circulation inward and upward and are elliptical in\r\nform. Their velocity varies from six hundred to nine hundred miles per\r\nday, moving in the same general direction. They are characterized in\r\ntheir eastern quadrants by cloudy weather, southerly and easterly winds,\r\nprecipitation, temperature oppressive in summer and abnormally high in\r\nwinter, falling barometer, increasing humidity and followed by clear\r\nweather, rising barometer, decreasing humidity and falling temperature\r\nin the western quadrants.\r\n\r\nBuys Ballot’s law of winds is, that in the Northern Hemisphere if one\r\nstands with his back to the wind, the low barometric pressure will be\r\ninvariably to the left hand; in the Southern Hemisphere the lowest\r\npressure is always to the right. This law explains one of the\r\ncharacteristics of low pressure storms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AREAS OF HIGH PRESSURE\r\n\r\nIn speaking of low pressure storms we called them storm centers, because\r\nnearly always they are of sufficient intensity to bear that name, but in\r\nhigh pressure areas we do not speak of them as storm centers.\r\n\r\nThe Buys Ballot’s law applies to anti-cyclonic as well as cyclonic\r\nstorms, that is, when one’s back is to the wind, the lowest barometric\r\npressure is at the left and the highest at the right. This is probably\r\nunderstood by saying that in the cyclonic storms, the winds blow inward,\r\ncontrary to the hands of a watch, and in the anti-cyclonic they blow\r\noutward, that is, in the same direction to the direction of the hands of\r\nthe watch.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the cyclonic storms are not as frequent as low\r\npressure storms, and it is safe to say that probably not more than\r\none-third of the entire anti-cyclonic areas can be classed as storm\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WHY AIR RISES\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting experiment is to secure a long-stemmed glass\r\nbulb (see Fig. 32). Arrange this apparatus as illustrated, with the stem\r\nof the bulb immersed in the water. The glass bulb condenses the air.\r\nWhen you first put it into the water nothing happens, but as soon as you\r\napply heat the air bubbles come out of the end of the tube. This means\r\nthat the air in the tube has expanded and part of it has come out\r\nthrough the stem of the tube and the remainder is lighter. It is well to\r\nremember, when air is heated it expands and becomes lighter. This fact\r\nis extremely important to remember, because it has a great deal to do\r\nwith the important instrument, the barometer, which is used to measure\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere and is an important element in the\r\nquestion of humidity, as you will learn later. By this time you no doubt\r\nhave learned that:\r\n\r\n1. Air has weight.\r\n\r\n2. Heated air expands, becomes lighter, and exerts less pressure.\r\n\r\n3. Cold air comes from the side to take the place of hot air that rises.\r\n\r\nWhen the rays of the sun heat an area of the earth, the air over such a\r\nplace expands and becomes lighter, naturally rising, and the result of\r\nthis is that the winds are produced by cool air moving in to take the\r\nplace of the heated air. This cool air moves in from all directions.\r\nWhen such a thing happens at any point on the earth’s surface, it is\r\nknown as a storm center, an area of low pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WHAT IS A CYCLONIC STORM?\r\n\r\nBecause of the rotation of the earth on its axis, a force arises which\r\ntends to deflect to the right all motions in the northern hemisphere,\r\nand to the left all motions in the southern hemisphere. The winds\r\nflowing toward the storm center are turned to the right or left and move\r\nin a spiral around the storm center. This system of whirling winds\r\naround a central region of low pressure produce what is termed a\r\ncyclonic storm. Storms have a tendency to move in an easterly or\r\nnortheasterly direction, and at a rate of from five hundred to seven\r\nhundred miles a day. Cyclonic storms, although we look upon them as\r\nbeing very severe, are very often mild and not of an intensive\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n              WHICH WAY DOES THE WIND BLOW AFTER A STORM?\r\n\r\nFrom the descriptions and experiments preceding, which illustrate the\r\ndevelopment of storms, reference was made only to the winds blowing in\r\ntoward the storm center. Naturally the question comes to your mind: What\r\nhappens to them after the cold air has taken the place of the warm air?\r\nThey change to other directions when the storm has passed away. It is\r\nbecause of this fact that we look for a change in weather conditions\r\nwhen the wind changes—a very important sign that you will be interested\r\nin later on.\r\n\r\nIt is well to mention here a thing that is going to be very important to\r\nus when we study the barometer, that is, the pressure of the atmosphere.\r\nShould the pressure of the air, which is normally at sea level 14.7\r\npounds to the square inch, change, that is, become lighter, it would not\r\nexert so much pressure on the column of mercury in the tube of the\r\nbarometer and the mercury would drop in the tube. (See Fig. 7.) On the\r\nother hand, if the weight of the air was increased, that is, if it\r\nbecame heavier, it would force the mercury to rise in the tube. This\r\nshould be quite clear to you, because it is the lightness and heaviness\r\nof the air that is going to interest us more particularly than any other\r\npart of the subject when we get into the study of the atmospheric\r\nchanges, what causes them, and the indications that lead up to our\r\nconclusions. In order that this principle is absolutely clear to you,\r\nyou should perform Experiment 4, or if you have not facilities for doing\r\nit, it is well to see it performed in any physics laboratory.\r\n\r\nImmediately you ask yourself: If air has such a tremendous pressure as\r\n14.7 pounds to the square inch, why is it that a weight of air amounting\r\nto thirty-five thousand pounds bearing down on the average individual\r\ndoes not cave the body in? Simply because air penetrates the body so\r\neasily that it exerts as much pressure on the inside as on the outside,\r\nand thereby equalizes itself. For instance, if you go down into a subway\r\nor a caisson (a water-tight box or chamber within which submarine\r\nconstruction is carried on under great air pressure to keep out the\r\nwater), where the pressure is sometimes greater than it is outside, have\r\nyou noticed the effect this pressure exerts on the ear drums? As it\r\nbecomes greater, you may equalize it by swallowing, which allows the air\r\nto get back of the ear drums through the Eustachian tubes, which lead\r\nfrom the mouth to the inner ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MOISTURE\r\n\r\nWater vapor is always present in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           EXPERIMENT NO. 10\r\n\r\nExpose a piece of dry potash to the air. You will soon discover that the\r\npotash will dissolve. It has taken up water from the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           EXPERIMENT NO. 11\r\n\r\nPut a piece of ice in a pitcher of water and allow it to stand in a warm\r\nroom. You will soon notice that little beads of perspiration collect on\r\nthe outside of the pitcher. This moisture is air being condensed.\r\n\r\nWater vapor is part of the atmosphere. Some of it is always present in\r\nthe air. The amount of vapor that the air can hold depends upon the\r\ntemperature. When the temperature is warm, the air will hold more water.\r\nFor instance, at 100° F. a cubic foot of air will hold 19.79 grains of\r\nvapor; at 80° F., 10.95 grains; at 50° F., 4.09 grains, and 32° F., 2.17\r\ngrains. At 32° F. is the freezing point on the Fahrenheit scale.\r\n\r\nAir containing as much water vapor as it can hold is saturated. If the\r\nair is suddenly cooled down, that is, if the temperature falls when the\r\nair is saturated, air molecules are contracted, and it must give up the\r\nwater, which produces rain. The ocean and the Great Lakes are the source\r\nfrom which the air gets its water. It rises into the air in the form of\r\nvapor, that is, vapor rising from the surface of the water, and the wind\r\ndistributes it over the land. Condensation turns it into clouds, and\r\nwhen it is over-saturated, or rather, when the temperature drops and the\r\nair is unable to retain any more water, then it forms into drops of\r\nwater and falls as rain. When the clouds get into the air, below the\r\nfreezing point of the water, the drops of water are changed into ice\r\ncrystals or snow flakes.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice crystals are just at the point of melting into water, due\r\nto the rise in temperature, the snowflakes lose their form and the\r\nresult is sleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HOW CAN WE USE THESE FACTS?\r\n\r\nSo far we have described, in a general way, certain facts about the\r\nelements of the air, such as temperature, pressure, humidity,\r\nprecipitation, evaporation, clouds, winds, etc., and these facts of the\r\nelements enter into a very interesting phase of weather observation\r\nwhich we will designate as prophesying without instruments or\r\nforecasting by physical science. When we come to the more interesting\r\nand scientific part of weather observation, we will drop the word\r\n“prophecy,” because the instruments that are used to measure these\r\nelements are going to indicate certain things to us that will lead you\r\nto more definite conclusions. Hence, the following observations are what\r\nhave given an opportunity to the weather prophet or to those people who\r\nhave been credited with some mysterious power to prophesy what the\r\nweather is going to be. They are not definite or conclusive, and they\r\ncannot always be depended upon, but they certainly are significant and\r\ninteresting, and a description of weather would not be complete without\r\na list in chronological order of a series of phenomena or physical signs\r\nof this character that have lead certain men to gain quite a reputation\r\nfor prophesying what the weather is going to be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 33\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPEARANCES\r\n\r\nVarious appearances that come in the sky.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a good example is in the case of the thunder storm, which\r\ncan be determined at least a few hours in advance, by the movement of\r\nthe clouds and the forms they take. In every locality there is a\r\ndirection that clouds take that forecasts bad weather, and there is a\r\ndirection that clouds take that forecasts fair weather.\r\n\r\nWhen you see a halo about the top of a mountain, you know that bad\r\nweather is expected. The same is true when a halo appears about the\r\nmoon. This indicates rain, or if the lower clouds break up and the upper\r\nclouds, or a second light covering of clouds, are seen above the lower\r\nones, it speaks for continued bad weather. In some localities if rainy\r\nweather is continuing for some time, and a certain change in wind sets\r\nin, it will indicate that good weather is coming.\r\n\r\nThese observations will be readily understood as being adapted for\r\ncertain localities and are not general. It is always necessary that the\r\nobserver adapt himself to these localities and study them, so that he\r\ncan make prophecies accordingly. It should be borne in mind that these\r\nprophecies are only possible from one day to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WHAT THE CLOUDS INDICATE\r\n\r\nWhen high clouds are seen crossing the sun or the moon in a different\r\ndirection from the lower clouds, this indicates change of wind toward\r\nthe direction of the higher clouds. When you see hard-edged clouds, look\r\nfor wind. When you see delicate soft clouds, look for fine weather and\r\nprobably moderate breeze or high breeze. When you see gloomy dark clouds\r\nin a blue sky, look for slight winds. When you see a bright blue sky\r\nthrough fine clouds that are soft and delicate, this indicates fine\r\nweather. When you see soft-looking clouds, you can expect less wind, but\r\nprobably rain. But when the clouds become hard and ragged, tufted and\r\nrolling in appearance, stronger winds are coming. When you see small\r\nclouds that are inky looking, look for rain. When you see light clouds\r\ntraveling across heavy hard masses of clouds, this indicates both wind\r\nand rain, but if the light scud clouds are alone, you may expect wind\r\nonly. Misty clouds forming or hanging over the peaks of hills indicate\r\nboth wind and rain. If during a rainy spell they ascend or disperse the\r\nweather is pretty certain to clear up. If there has been fine weather\r\nand you begin to see light streaks in the sky which are distant clouds,\r\nand they continue to increase and grow into cloudiness, this indicates\r\nrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SUNSET AS AN INDICATION\r\n\r\nWhen the sun is setting and the sky in the west presents a color of\r\nwhitish yellow or radiates out at a great height, rain can be looked for\r\nduring the next night or day. Gaudy colors where clouds are definitely\r\noutlined indicate probably wind and rain.\r\n\r\nBefore setting, if the sun looks diffused and the color is a brilliant\r\nwhite, this forecasts storms. When the sun sets in a slightly purple sky\r\nand the color at the zenith is a bright blue, this indicates fine\r\nweather. A red sunset generally indicates good weather, whereas a ruddy\r\nor misty sunset indicates bad weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WHAT THE SKY INDICATES\r\n\r\nWhen you see a dark, dismal sky, look for rain. A sky with a greenish\r\nhue, described as a sickly-looking sky, is an indication of both rain\r\nand wind. A sailor’s sky, which is red in the morning, means either wind\r\nor rain, and it makes no difference if the sky is cloudy or clear, if at\r\nsunset it is rosy, it indicates fine weather. A gray sky in the morning\r\nindicates fine weather. When daylight is first seen above a bank of\r\nclouds, look for a good stiff wind. Wind is indicated if we have a\r\nbright yellow sky in the morning, and rain is indicated if the sky takes\r\non a pale yellow hue. If the sky turns bright yellow late in the\r\nafternoon, it generally indicates that rain is near at hand. Unusual\r\ncolorations, particularly of deep intense color, indicate wind or rain.\r\n\r\nThe following appearances indicate a change in the weather: When the\r\natmosphere is clear and crystalline and the stars appear extremely\r\nbright; when the background of the horizon seems to be pinned up against\r\nthe foreground; when the clouds form into delicate white film-like mist\r\nway up overhead. (Fig. 33.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WHAT FOG AND DEW INDICATE\r\n\r\nLocality has considerable to do with what the fog indicates. As a rule,\r\nwhere you have fog, there is not much wind, and as a result it does not\r\nindicate stormy weather, unless the fog becomes heavy with overhanging\r\nsky, then it is apt to turn into rain, but a heavy fog with a light sky\r\nindicates fine weather. A fog in the morning generally indicates a fair\r\nday. A rising fog is a good indication for fair weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy Julien Friez & Sons, Baltimore, Md._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 34\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 35\r\n]\r\n\r\nDew is a pretty good sign of fine weather. When you can see and hear\r\nwith remarkable clearness, and everything is calm and still, it is a\r\npretty infallible sign that cold weather is due.\r\n\r\nFrost may be looked for on clear, calm, cloudless nights, when the\r\nground is apt to be cooler than the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     INDICATIONS FROM CIRRUS CLOUDS\r\n\r\nWhen these clouds suddenly appear in the sky on a clear summer day, they\r\nindicate wet weather. Especially if the weather ends turn upward, which\r\nmeans that the clouds are coming down. When moisture in the form of\r\nlittle drops cling to vegetation, it is a pretty good indication that\r\nthere is apt to be more rain.\r\n\r\nWhen the sky assumes the appearance of a gray mass and the sun is\r\nobserved shining through, it is a pretty good indication that it will\r\nrain before night.\r\n\r\nWhen overhead clouds are thick and grayish and the lower surface of them\r\nis lumpy, this is an indication of rain.\r\n\r\nWhirlwinds of dust are also indications of rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE MOON\r\n\r\nThe rings that we see formed about the moon are caused by the delicate\r\nwhite clouds through which the moon is shining.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy Julien Friez & Sons, Baltimore, Md._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 36\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE RAINBOW\r\n\r\nThe morning rainbow indicates that a shower is in the west, but if the\r\nrainbow is in the east it indicates that the shower has passed over.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BIRDS AND STORMS\r\n\r\nThere are certain actions of birds that indicate many things pertaining\r\nto the weather that are interesting. It is probable that their ability\r\nto fly into the air gives them a view of the horizon, that by instinct\r\nthey have been able to determine the atmospheric changes. For instance,\r\nit is well known that if birds of long flight remain at their base, it\r\ngenerally foretells a storm. The sudden silence of birds has been\r\nreferred to a great many times preceding a storm.\r\n\r\nBarnyard fowls do many peculiar things that foretell certain weather\r\nconditions. The crow flies low and in great circles, cawing loudly,\r\nbefore approaching rain.\r\n\r\nSometimes the house fly is a pretty good barometer. Generally before a\r\nstorm they seem to light on everything, particularly persons, and we\r\ncall them “sticky.” Generally at these times they congregate in swarms.\r\nMost everyone is familiar with the gnat. They are one of the few insects\r\nthat gives us indications and good signs, and when you see them forming\r\nin groups and moving along in front of you, you may expect fair weather.\r\n\r\nThere are many other interesting facts and fairy tales about indications\r\nby animals and insects, but there is nothing scientific about them. It\r\nhas been demonstrated that there is nothing conclusive to be drawn from\r\nsuch signs, so we will not attempt to waste pages of this book\r\nreiterating these fables.\r\n\r\nCertain actions of insects and animals give indications and enable the\r\nweather prophet to prophesy. The spider is a good example of an insect\r\nprophet, and if you will observe him carefully, you will find that when\r\nstormy weather is going to come on he shortens his webs, and if he\r\nanticipates a long, hard storm, he not only shortens the strings that\r\nhold up the web, but he strengthens them as well, and vice-versa, when\r\nhe anticipates fine weather, he lengthens his strands of the web. When\r\nyou see the spider cease his activities and he hangs pretty close to his\r\nhome, which is the center of the web, you will know that rain is\r\napproaching. On the other hand, if he continues to spread about during a\r\nstorm, you can be pretty certain that it is not going to be of very long\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nThe frog is a good example of an animal prophet. There is a green frog\r\nwhich has been studied in Germany, which will come out of the water when\r\nrainy weather or cold is approaching. Some observers have placed these\r\nfrogs in a glass jar with a landing provided so that he can come out of\r\nthe water when he wants to, and he is always observed high and dry above\r\nthe water several hours in advance of a storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS\r\n              Forecasting Weather by Means of Instruments\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first part of this book may not appeal to you, if you are of a\r\nscientific trend of mind, but it is quite essential that you possess a\r\nknowledge of the fundamentals treated in the earlier pages in order to\r\nthoroughly understand the weather instruments we will now describe.\r\nThese instruments are the scientific means of forecasting what the\r\nweather is going to be. They definitely indicate certain things, and\r\nfrom these indications you are going to be able to draw conclusions and\r\nbecome a scientist or meteorologist. The success that you attain will\r\ndepend upon the accuracy of the instruments and the care you use in\r\nreading them. You will be able to rig up a Weather Bureau of your own,\r\nand the use of these instruments will interest anyone in a study of the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE WEATHER VANE\r\n\r\nTo make a forecast, it is essential from what we have already written,\r\nto know the direction of the wind, and to determine the direction we\r\nmust have a weather vane. It is real important that the vane should be\r\nsensitive to the slightest movement of the wind and give actual wind\r\ndirections. At the same time it must possess the property of steadiness,\r\nso that when it is set up it will be rigid.\r\n\r\nFig. 34 shows the standard weather vane used at all United States\r\nWeather Bureau Stations and Fig. 35 shows the Gilbert Weather Vane.\r\n\r\nFig. 35. The Gilbert weather vane consists of a metal arrow pointer and\r\na metal rod eight inches long and five thirty-seconds of an inch in\r\ndiameter. The rod is fastened by means of a few staples to the side of a\r\npole, or whatever is to be used as a support for the vane. About three\r\ninches from the top of the rod is a collar with set screw, which is\r\ntightened, and the vane itself is then placed on the rod, the rod\r\npassing through the small angles A and B, between the sides of the vane.\r\nIt will be found that the vane will swing freely on this support, and by\r\nconstructing two crosspieces with letters N, S, E, and W at each end of\r\nthe pieces, of course having N pointing directly north, the vane will\r\nswing around and show the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 37\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe standard United States Weather Bureau type hardly needs explanation,\r\nas the illustration clearly shows all parts. It is the old, reliable,\r\nstandard iron, combined wind vane and anemometer support complete,\r\ntwenty feet high; iron contact box near base, improved roller bearings\r\nfor six-foot vane; latter, with electrical contacts shown enlarged at\r\nthe right. The vane is fastened securely to the roof of the building and\r\nheld in a perfectly vertical position.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE ANEMOMETER. Fig. 36\r\n\r\nIt is essential to know the velocity of the wind. This is determined by\r\nmeans of an instrument called the anemometer.\r\n\r\nFig. 36. The Standard U. S. Weather Bureau Station Anemometer.\r\n\r\nThis is the well-known standard Robinson Anemometer, now in universal\r\nuse throughout the world for the registration of wind velocity, but of\r\nthe latest improved construction. It records electrically the miles or\r\nkilometers, etc., of wind movements on a register. The standard pattern\r\nas furnished to Weather Bureau stations is made of brass, highly\r\npolished and finished, aluminum (or copper reinforced) cups, steel\r\nspindle with hard steel bearings, a ten-mile or kilometer indicator,\r\nelectrical contacts, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 38\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe four hollow hemispherical cups are mounted upon cross-arms at right\r\nangles to each other, with the open sections vertical and facing the\r\nsame way around the circumference. The cross-arms are on a vertical\r\naxis, which has at its lower end an endless screw. This axis is\r\nsupported so as to turn with as little friction as possible. The endless\r\nscrew is in gear with a wheel which moves two dials registering the\r\nnumber of revolutions of the cups. The mechanisms are mounted in a\r\nsuitable metal case with glass front, as shown in the illustration, well\r\nprotected from the weather, the whole being designed for outdoor use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy Julien Friez & Sons, Baltimore, Md._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 39\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe center of the cups moves with a velocity about one-third that of the\r\nwind which puts them in motion. The cups are four inches in diameter.\r\nThe distance from center of cup to center of rotation or axis is 6.72\r\ninches. Assuming that the wind-travel is exactly three times that of the\r\ncenter of the cup, the dials are marked to register miles of wind\r\ntravel, five hundred revolutions of the cups corresponding to a mile.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of wind-travel to travel of cup is in reality variable,\r\ndepending on the velocity of the wind. It is less for high than low\r\nvelocities. It varies also with the dimensions of the instrument, being\r\ndifferent for every different length of arm and diameter of cup.\r\n\r\nOn account of the great interference offered by buildings and other\r\nobstructions to the free movement of the wind, its velocity is much less\r\nin the vicinity of these obstructions than beyond; therefore, in\r\nselecting the location for an anemometer, preference should be given to\r\nthe more elevated points in the vicinity of the station, and some rigid\r\nsupport should be used to raise the instrument as far as practicable\r\nabove the immediate influence of the office building itself. The support\r\nmust be set up so that the anemometer on top or on the cross-arm is as\r\nnearly vertical as possible.\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows clearly the appearance of an approved Weather\r\nBureau pattern combined support for wind instruments, similar to the one\r\ninstalled at our plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 40\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy Taylor Instrument Companies Rochester, N. Y._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 41\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 37. The Gilbert Anemometer.\r\n\r\nThe Gilbert Anemometer consists of a case containing a spindle passing\r\nthrough a worm gear, which turns a toothed gear. This gear in its rotary\r\nmotion makes a contact with a brass brush, which is connected\r\nelectrically with a flashlight. The cross-arms, with cups attached, is\r\nplaced on the spindle, and as the wind blows, it revolves the cups,\r\ncausing the contact. The velocity of the wind is determined by counting\r\nthe flashes for fifteen seconds, thus giving you the number of miles per\r\nhour. For instance, if light flashes eight times in fifteen seconds,\r\nthis signifies that the wind is blowing eight miles an hour.\r\n\r\nFig. 38. How to Connect the Gilbert Anemometer.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the diagram, you will see that one wire which should be\r\nthe annunciator wire, or even a small electric light wire, is connected\r\nfrom the wire at the anemometer case directly to one side of the lamp\r\nsocket. Another piece of the same size wire connects the other side of\r\nthe lamp socket to one terminal of your switch. The second terminal of\r\nthe switch should be connected to an outer post of one dry battery. The\r\ninner post of this same dry battery should be connected to the outer\r\npost of the second dry battery. Complete the circuit by connecting the\r\ninner post of the second dry battery to any one of the screws at the\r\nbottom of the anemometer case. The lamp used should be a small\r\nflashlight battery lamp for use on two and a half to three volts. Be\r\nsure in making the connections that the ends of your wire are scraped\r\nfree from insulation and dirt. This can be done by cutting off the\r\ninsulation with a knife and then rubbing the copper wire bright by a\r\npiece of sandpaper or emery cloth, or even a file. The switch should be\r\nleft open when you are not taking readings, in order to prolong the life\r\nof your batteries. By unloosening the little screw in the hub of the\r\nanemometer vanes, you can remove them and also take off the brass cap on\r\nthe anemometer case. This should be taken apart once or twice a month,\r\nand some machine oil used around the bearings to keep them from wearing\r\nout too quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n   THE STANDARD ELECTRICAL SUNSHINE RECORDER AND THE GILBERT SUNSHINE\r\n                                RECORDER\r\n\r\nFig. 39. The standard sunshine recorder is designed for recording the\r\nduration of sunshine electrically, continuously, and automatically, on a\r\nregister. The instrument is essentially a differential air thermometer\r\nin the form of a straight glass tube with cylindrical bulbs at each end,\r\nenclosed in a protecting glass sheath, with suitable platinum wire\r\nelectrodes fused in at the center, the whole mounted in a metal socket\r\non an adjustable support.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy Taylor Instrument Companies, Rochester, N. Y._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 42\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe base is secured to the support on the roof so that the glass tube\r\npoints north and south, with the blackened bulb toward the south and\r\nlowermost, then the tube is inclined at such an angle that the\r\ninstrument will begin and cease to record sunshine with the proper\r\ndegree of cloudiness. This inclination should be approximately 45° from\r\nthe vertical. The machine should be adjusted at an hour when the sun is\r\nwholly obscured.\r\n\r\nIn temperate and cold climates, slightly different adjustments will be\r\nfound necessary at different seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nFig. 40. The Gilbert Sunshine Recorder consists of a metal case,\r\ncylindrical in form, with a piece of metal turned up on the ends,\r\ndividing the cylinder in half. On each side of the case are small holes\r\nthrough which the sun casts its rays and records its movement and\r\nduration on a small piece of blue print paper inside the cylinder, one\r\npiece of paper being in each compartment.

The\r\nprinciple of this instrument was first discovered by Torricelli, a pupil\r\nof Galileo, the great Italian philosopher and scientist, in 1643. Many\r\nand various types of instruments have been made, but the two most\r\ngenerally used, especially where accurate indications are desired, are\r\nthe mercurial and aneroid barometers. Either of these instruments are\r\nquite sensitive to changes in the weight or pressure of the earth’s\r\natmosphere, and from their variations we are able to draw conclusions\r\nrelative to changes in the weather. Figs. No. 41 and 42 illustrate the\r\nstandard mercurial and aneroid barometers used most extensively today. A\r\ndescription of these barometers will serve to make the photographs\r\nclearer to the readers of this text.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE MERCURIAL BAROMETER (Fig. 41)\r\n\r\nThe mercurial barometer in use today is practically the same as that\r\ninvented by Torricelli. Of course, many changes have been made in the\r\ncase containing the tube of mercury, adding to its attractiveness, but\r\nthe principle remains the same.\r\n\r\nThe standard mercurial barometer consists of a straight glass tube about\r\nthirty-two or thirty-three inches in length, hermetically sealed at one\r\nend. The tube is of half-inch bore and is filled with chemically pure\r\nmercury, which has been boiled in the tube to insure the total exclusion\r\nof all air and moisture. After the tube has been filled, the open end is\r\nimmersed in a cistern of mercury. Upon immersion the mercury drops in\r\nthe tube to a height of 29.92 inches at sea level, or until\r\ncounterbalanced by the weight of the surrounding atmosphere pressing\r\nupon the surface of the mercury in the cistern. The space in the top of\r\nthe tube is a perfect vacuum and is called the Torricellian vacuum.\r\n\r\nThe glass mercury tube is enclosed in a brass case. About two inches\r\nfrom the top of the case is an opening extending down the front and back\r\nfor a distance of about eight inches. On each side of this opening is a\r\ngraduated scale, one side being in inches and the other graduated in\r\ncentimeters. The opening is fitted with a sliding vernier scale\r\ngraduated in millimeters, thus permitting the reading of changes in the\r\nheight of the mercury column most accurately, as the sliding vernier may\r\nbe adjusted to the level of the mercury by means of a thumb screw fitted\r\non the side of the case. The cistern containing the mercury is of glass,\r\nwith a soft leather or chamois bottom and an adjusting screw, used to\r\nraise or lower the level of the mercury, so that it just comes in\r\ncontact with a small ivory point, inserted in the top of the cistern,\r\nand which is used to mark the zero of the scale. Observations of the\r\nchanges in the atmospheric pressure should be taken at regular\r\nintervals, and it is necessary to adjust the height of the mercury in\r\nthe cistern before each observation. This is done by bringing the ivory\r\npoint in contact with the level of the mercury and then bringing the\r\nvernier scale absolutely level with the top of the column of mercury in\r\nthe tube, and then take the reading.\r\n\r\nThe mercurial barometer is a very delicate instrument and when once\r\nplaced in the desired position should not be moved. Care should be taken\r\nthat the room in which the barometer is placed is of nearly uniform\r\ntemperature, for if the temperature at the top of the barometer is\r\ndifferent than the temperature at the bottom, of course there will be an\r\neffect produced on the changes in the mercury column. All other\r\nbarometers are set by the mercurial.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE ANEROID BAROMETER (Fig. 42).\r\n\r\nThe aneroid barometer is so constructed that it contains no liquid\r\nwhatever, and thus derives its name from the Greek compound word\r\n“aneroid,” meaning “without fluid.”\r\n\r\nThe essential parts of the instrument are a metallic case from which the\r\nair has been exhausted, and which contains a spring. The case of elastic\r\nmetal is fastened to a base plate at the bottom and to the spring at the\r\ntop. The pressure of the atmosphere causes the case to expand and\r\ncontract, thus affecting the spring, which is connected to a needle or\r\ndial, causing the dial to move around on the scale on the face of the\r\ninstrument and record the changes. The scale is marked off in inches\r\nfrom 28 to 31, and besides a brass hand or pointer, used to designate\r\nthe changes in the atmospheric pressure, there is a small index hand to\r\nset over the needle so that the amount of change in a certain period is\r\neasily known on consulting the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy Julien Friez & Sons, Baltimore, Md._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 45\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe dial of the barometer is marked with the words “Fair,” “Change,” and\r\n“Rain,” etc., but these words have no significance, and should be\r\ndisregarded. For instance, 29½ is marked “Change”; 30, “Fair”; 31, “Very\r\ndry”; 28½, “Rain.” If the barometer, which has been standing at 30.9,\r\nsuddenly drops down to 29.9, this is positive indication that a storm is\r\napproaching, with strong winds, yet, according to the dial on the\r\naneroid, the reading would be “Fair.” If the barometer were standing at\r\n28 and rose to 29, this would actually indicate approach of cold, dry\r\nweather, and yet on the dial it reads “Rain.” This simply goes to show\r\nthat the readings on the dial are of no significance whatsoever, and are\r\nnot to be relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe aneroid is not as accurate an instrument as the mercurial, so should\r\nbe checked up occasionally with the mercurial barometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy Taylor Instrument Companies Rochester, N. Y._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 46\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe aneroid type of barometer is also used in altitude work, but must be\r\ncompensated before using.\r\n\r\nThis type of barometer possesses several advantages over the mercurial\r\nin that it is portable and therefore used for altitude work; at sea it\r\nis used because there is no fluid to become unsettled by the motion of\r\nthe vessel; it is used also in observatory work because the action is\r\nquicker than the mercurial barometer action, and sudden changes likely\r\nto occur are indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     INDICATIONS FROM THE BAROMETER\r\n\r\nA single observation reading of the barometer is of no significance.\r\nReadings must be taken at different intervals or the results will be\r\nmisleading. The important thing about the barometer is to watch the rise\r\nand fall, particularly, whether it is gradual or rapid. From no single\r\nreading can you make an observation or a forecast. A rapid rise\r\nindicates that a strong wind is apt to blow. A rapid fall indicates that\r\nthe weather will be unsettled, and that strong winds are apt to blow.\r\nBoth indicate a change in the weather, depending upon many things,\r\nparticularly, however, the direction from which the wind blows. If an\r\nobserver stands with the wind blowing on his back, the area of low\r\nbarometric pressure will be at his left, and that of high barometric\r\npressure at his right. With low pressure in the west and high pressure\r\nin the east, the wind will be from the south; but with low pressure in\r\nthe east and high pressure in the west, the wind will be from the north.\r\nThe barometer rises for northerly winds, from northwest by the north to\r\neastward, for dry, or less wet weather, for less wind, or for more than\r\none of these changes—except on a few occasions, when rain, hail, or snow\r\ncomes from the northward with strong wind. The barometer falls for\r\nsoutherly wind, from southeast, by the south, to the westward, for wet\r\nweather, for stronger wind, or for more than one of these changes,\r\nexcept on a few occasions, when moderate wind with rain or snow comes\r\nfrom the northward.\r\n\r\n                             RELATIVE HUMIDITY TABLES\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Per Cent Fahrenheit

If the\r\nhands move a trifle, it indicates that there is the tendency to rise or\r\nfall, depending upon the direction of movement of the hands.)\r\n\r\nNortheasterly winds precede storms that approach from the southwest;\r\nthat is, in New England and the Middle States and the Ohio Valley.\r\nSoutheasterly winds precede storms that approach from the Lake region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THERMOMETERS\r\n\r\nFor information regarding the manufacture of thermometers, we recommend\r\nP. R. Jameson’s book, “Weather and Weather Instruments,” published by\r\nthe Taylor Instrument Companies of Rochester, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThermometers are of great importance to us in determining weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LOCATION OF THERMOMETERS\r\n\r\n1. They must be properly exposed.\r\n\r\n2. A good circulation of air around them is necessary.\r\n\r\n3. They must be properly protected from the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n_Note_: If these instructions are not carefully followed out, errors are\r\napt to occur, and you will be misled.\r\n\r\nFor a change of wind towards northerly directions, a thermometer falls.\r\nFor a change of wind toward southerly directions a thermometer rises.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 50\r\n\r\n  GILBERT RAIN GAUGE\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THERMOMETERS\r\n\r\nMaximum and minimum thermometers are used to record the daily maximum\r\nand minimum temperatures. Fig. 46 shows a typical maximum and minimum\r\nthermometer used for giving the extremes of temperature. One side of the\r\nthermometer has a scale reading, beginning at the top, from 60° below\r\nzero to 140° above zero. This is the scale used when determining the\r\ncoldest temperature reached during a day. The other side of the\r\nthermometer has a scale marked from 70° below zero, beginning at the\r\nbottom and reading up, to 130° above zero. On this side the maximum heat\r\nreached during the day is recorded. There is a small metal piece in the\r\ntubes, one on each side, and as the mercury pushes ahead or recedes, the\r\nsmall index is left at the lowest point reached in one tube and at the\r\nhighest point reached in the other. The small metal piece is drawn back\r\nto the level of the mercury by means of a small magnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  WHEN MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE IS REACHED\r\n\r\nYou can generally look for maximum temperature between three and four\r\no’clock in the afternoon. At this time the sun has reached its highest\r\naltitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy Julien Friez & Sons, Baltimore, Md._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 51\r\n\r\n  TIPPING BUCKET RAIN GAUGE\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                WHEN THE MINIMUM TEMPERATURE IS REACHED\r\n\r\nThis usually occurs a little while before sunrise. It is important in\r\nweather observing to make a record of the highest temperature of the day\r\nand the lowest temperature of the night. Continuous observation, as the\r\nreader will appreciate, is practically impossible for such a record.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE THERMOMETER FOR HUMIDITY IN THE AIR\r\n\r\nMoisture or dampness in the air, as shown by an instrument called the\r\nhygrometer, increases before rain, fog, or dew.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the hygrometer, a definition of a few of the terms\r\nused in conjunction with the instrument will be found useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ABSOLUTE HUMIDITY\r\n\r\nThe amount of vapor actually present in the atmosphere is termed the\r\nabsolute humidity, expressed usually either in the expansive force that\r\nthe vapor exerts or in its weight in grains per cubic foot of air.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RELATIVE HUMIDITY\r\n\r\nThe absolute humidity divided by the amount of vapor that might exist if\r\nthe air were saturated gives a ratio that is called the relative\r\nhumidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DEW POINT\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which moisture begins to be condensed on a cold\r\nvessel or other container and becomes visible is called the dew point.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HOW HYGROMETERS ARE MADE\r\n\r\nThe most generally used hygrometer consists of two ordinary\r\nthermometers, the bulb of one being covered with a piece of muslin and\r\nkept constantly moistened with water by means of a wick or cotton thread\r\ncommunicating with a container of water. The difference in the readings\r\nof the two thermometers, the wet and the dry, is observed, and knowing\r\nthis, it is very easy to determine the humidity by consulting a table\r\n(see table on pages 58–59), which has been prepared for this purpose.\r\nThese instruments are, according to the increase in price, equipped with\r\na table, and the container is held in a wire frame, as you will see from\r\nthe Figs. 49–50 showing the standard Weather Bureau station instrument\r\nand the Gilbert hygrometer.\r\n\r\nFig. 49 shows the U. S. Standard Weather Bureau Station Rain Gauge, Fig.\r\n50 the Gilbert Rain Gauge and Fig. 51 the U. S. Standard Weather Bureau\r\nStation Rain Gauge, Tipping Bucket Type.\r\n\r\nThe Gilbert Weather Station is equipped with the Tipping Bucket Type\r\nRain Gauge. Fig. 51 shows the apparatus clearly, complete and mounted\r\nready for use. The brass bucket seen in position through the open door\r\nis adjusted to tip for each hundredth inch of rainfall collected in the\r\ntwelve-inch diameter receiver at the top, and this rainfall is\r\nelectrically recorded at any convenient distance on a register. After\r\nany desired period the water may be drawn off and check measurements\r\nmade by means of the brass measuring tube and graduated cedar stick\r\nshown in the figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE GILBERT RAIN GAUGE (Fig. 50).\r\n\r\n (_a_) Tube.\r\n\r\n (_b_) Funnel.\r\n\r\n (_c_) Measuring stick.\r\n\r\nThe essential parts of the Gilbert Rain Gauge consists of a metal tube\r\ntwelve inches long, having a diameter of 1⁵⁄₁₆ inches (inside) and a\r\nfunnel-shaped top, the neck of which fits snugly into the open end of\r\nthe metal tube. The outside diameter of the neck of the funnel is a\r\ntrifle less than 1⁵⁄₁₆ inches. The area of the circle formed at the top\r\nof the tube is one-tenth the area of the funnel circle. A measuring\r\nstick is provided to measure the rainfall collected in the tube.\r\n\r\nTo determine the amount of rainfall on the surface of the ground, the\r\nrain collected in the tube should be measured at regular intervals,\r\nusually twelve hours apart. For every inch of rain collected in the\r\ntube, as denoted by the measuring stick, it means that there is one\r\none-tenth of an inch of rain on the ground; if 10 inches of rain in the\r\ntube, it signifies one inch of rain on the ground. In other words,\r\ndivide the figure recorded on the measuring stick by ten for actual\r\nrainfall.\r\n\r\nIt is well to put some sort of a shelter around the gauge, so that it\r\nwill be protected from strong winds. The shelter is usually placed at a\r\ndistance from the tube equal to the height of the tube. With the Gilbert\r\nrain gauge it is well to erect the shelter at a distance of about three\r\nfeet from the tube. It is essential that the gauge be held in an upright\r\nposition, so it should be fastened to the roof.\r\n\r\nSnow is measured by melting the quantity collected in the gauge and\r\nfollow the same procedure as in rainfall measurements.\r\n\r\nThere is another very common method, called ground measurement. There\r\nare many instances where ground measurements are inaccurate:\r\n\r\n1. When snow and rain are mixed or alternate.\r\n\r\n2. When melting accompanies snowfall.\r\n\r\n3. When snow is already upon the ground.\r\n\r\n4. When the amount of fall is very small.\r\n\r\n5. When drifting is very bad.\r\n\r\n6. When the snow is blown about after the storm and before measurements\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\nA bucket and a spring balance are used. The bucket is filled with snow,\r\nbut not packed down too hard, and weighed. The reading of the index hand\r\non the spring balance gives the density of the snow. The depth of the\r\nsnow in the vicinity of the spot from which the bucket was filled is\r\nobtained and this figure is multiplied by the density, thus giving the\r\nwater equivalent of the snow collected. For instance, if the reading of\r\nthe balance was .16, and the depth of the snow was 7 inches, multiply\r\n.16 by 7, and the result, 1.12, is the water equivalent of the snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THERMOMETER SCALES\r\n\r\nThe first thermometer scale to give satisfaction was devised in 1714 by\r\nFahrenheit. He determined the fixed points on the thermometer in a very\r\nnovel manner. Having been born at Dantzig, he took for the zero point on\r\nhis scale the lowest temperature observed by him at Dantzig, which he\r\nfound was that produced by mixing equal quantities of snow and\r\nsal-ammoniac. The space between this point and that to which the mercury\r\nrose at the temperature of boiling water he divided into 212 parts. He\r\ndetermined, with his thermometer, that the atmospheric pressure governed\r\nthe boiling point of water. Today the Fahrenheit thermometer is used\r\nextensively, and has for its freezing point 32° and for its boiling\r\npoint 212°.\r\n\r\nAnother scale that has not become too well known, because of the fact\r\nthat it did not meet with public favor, was devised by a Frenchman,\r\nnamed Reaumur, in 1730, and bears his name. He determined the freezing\r\npoint of the scale at 0° and the boiling point of water at 80°.\r\n\r\nAnother Frenchman, named Anders Celsius, devised a scale with the\r\nboiling point of water at 0° and the freezing point at 100°. In 1743 a\r\nFrenchman, named Christin, living at Lyons, France, reversed the points,\r\nand today the scale is known as the Centigrade scale, and, together with\r\nthe Fahrenheit scale, is used almost exclusively wherever thermometers\r\nare required.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  HOW TO CHANGE ONE SCALE INTO ANOTHER\r\n\r\nCentigrade degrees into Fahrenheit: multiply by 9, divide the product by\r\n5 and add 32.\r\n\r\nFahrenheit degrees into Centigrade: subtract 32, multiply by 5, and\r\ndivide by 9.\r\n\r\nReaumur degrees into Fahrenheit: multiply by 9, divide by 4, and add 32.\r\n\r\nFahrenheit degrees into Reaumur: subtract 32, multiply by 4, and divide\r\nby 9.\r\n\r\nReaumur degrees into Centigrade: multiply by 5 and divide by 4.\r\n\r\nCentigrade degrees into Reaumur: multiply by 4 and divide by 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WEATHER BUREAU STATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES AND WEATHER BUREAU MAPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the Weather Bureau Stations of the United\r\nStates, and from any of these offices, preferably the one nearest you,\r\nyou will be able to obtain the weather reports and weather map (see Fig.\r\n52), indicating many things of interest, and from which you will be able\r\nto make a careful study of the weather.\r\n\r\n ABILENE, TEX.\r\n ALBANY, N.

Second, the Isotherm lines—these are dotted\r\nlines drawn through places having the same temperature.\r\n\r\nThe Weather Bureau Maps are gotten out on the same day all over the\r\ncountry, and the preparation of them is quite interesting.\r\n\r\nAt 7:40 A. M. simultaneous readings are taken at all weather bureau\r\nstations of the country. On the coast, where the time is three hours\r\ndifferent than at New York, the readings are taken at 4:40, so that the\r\nhour corresponds at all places. At 8:00 A. M. the various stations\r\ntelephone their findings to the Western Union Office located in their\r\ncity and immediately the messages are transmitted by Western Union to a\r\ncentral district office, or circuit center as it is called. For New\r\nEngland, the circuit center is Boston. All messages are received at this\r\noffice, and from here transmitted to the next office, which is New York,\r\nand from New York to the next center, until the news is transmitted to\r\nthe coast. The wires are open from 8:00 until 9:30 A. M. The western\r\noffices follow the same procedure until the weather indications are\r\nreceived by all stations. Immediately the preparation of the map is\r\nbegun and they are mailed to interested parties by the Weather Bureau\r\nStations of the United States.\r\n\r\nFigs. 52, 53 and 54 show three maps, typifying storms traveling from the\r\nwest to the east, and by studying them on successive days you can at\r\nonce grasp the importance of studying the weather from these maps.\r\n\r\nFig. 53 shows a storm of low pressure and how this area of low pressure\r\nis progressing and moving from the west to the east. Particular notice\r\nshould be taken of how fast the storm travels, that is, the distance it\r\ngoes each day, and the direction it is going and the results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 52\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 53\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 54\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe arrows denote the direction of the wind, and you will notice they\r\npoint to the region of low barometric pressure. In the regions of high\r\nbarometric pressure the winds are in the opposite direction. This\r\nreadily explains to you why it is that you can expect changes in weather\r\nconditions when the wind changes.\r\n\r\nFrom the markings and printed matter on each map, information is secured\r\nregarding observations of the barometer, thermometer, wind velocity,\r\ndirection of the wind, kind of clouds, and their movements, and the\r\namount of precipitation (rain or snow), in different localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n               HOW THE STATE OF THE WEATHER IS INDICATED\r\n\r\nClear, partly cloudy, cloudy, rain or snow indications are symbolized.\r\nThe shaded area designates places or areas where precipitation has\r\noccurred during the preceding twelve hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n             WHAT THE WORDS “HIGH” OR “LOW” MEAN ON THE MAP\r\n\r\nLow barometric pressure, or the storm centers, are indicated on the map\r\nby the word “low.” High barometric pressure centers are indicated by the\r\nword “high.” Note how they move in an easterly direction; how they are\r\nprogressive. They can be compared to a series of waves, which we will\r\ncall atmospheric waves. The crest of the wave may be likened to the\r\n“highs” and the troughs to the “lows.”\r\n\r\nUsually the winds are southerly or easterly and therefore warmer in\r\nadvance of a “low.” When the “lows” progress east of a place, the wind\r\ngenerally shifts to westerly and the temperature lowers. The westward\r\nadvance of the “lows” is preceded by precipitation, and almost always in\r\nthe form of rain or snow, following which the weather is generally\r\nclear. Note how a “low” is followed by a “high,” and so on as they move\r\nalong eastwardly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WHAT ISOTHERMS INDICATE\r\n\r\nIf the Isotherms run nearly parallel, that is, east and west, there will\r\nmost likely be no change in the temperature. Southerly to east winds\r\nprevail west of the nearly north and south line, passing through the\r\nmiddle of a “high” and also east of a like line passing through the\r\nmiddle of a “low.”\r\n\r\nTo the west of a nearly north and south line passing through the middle\r\nof a “low,” northerly to westerly winds prevail. We will find the same\r\ncondition prevailing to the east of a line passing through the center of\r\na “high.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 55\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen we find an absence of decidedly energetic “lows” and “highs,” this\r\nis an indication of the continuance of existing weather. We can expect\r\nthis state of the atmosphere until later maps show a beginning of a\r\nchange, usually first appearing in the west.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 TRACKS OF STORMS IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nThe storms of the United States follow, however, year after year, a\r\nseries of tracks, not likely to change suddenly, and not irregular, but\r\nrelated to each other by very well-defined laws.\r\n\r\nThe United States Weather Bureau has made a very intensive study of the\r\npositions of the tracks of the storms. Fig. 55 shows the mean tracks and\r\nthe movement of storms from day to day. This map indicates that\r\ngenerally there are two sets of lines running west and east, one set\r\nover the northwestern boundary, the Lake region, and the St. Lawrence\r\nValley, the other set over the middle Rocky Mountain districts and the\r\nGulf States. Each of these is double, with one for the “highs” and one\r\nfor the “lows.” Furthermore, there are lines crossing from the main\r\ntracks to join them together, showing how storms pass from one to the\r\nother. On the chart, the heavy lines all belong to the tracks of the\r\n“highs,” and the lighter lines to the track of the “lows.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE MODE OF TRAVEL OF THE “HIGHS”\r\n\r\nA “high” reaching the California coast may cross the mountains near Salt\r\nLake City (follow the track on the map), and then pass directly over the\r\nbelt of the Gulf States, turning northeastward and reaching the Virginia\r\ncoast; or it may move farther northward, cross the Rocky Mountains in\r\nthe State of Washington, up the Columbia River Valley, then turn east,\r\nand finally reach the Gulf of St. Lawrence. These tracks are located\r\nwhere they are by the laws of general circulation of the atmosphere and\r\nthe outline of the North American continent. This movement of the\r\n“highs” from the middle Pacific coast to Florida or to the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence is confined to the summer half of the year, that is, from April\r\nto September. In the winter months, on the other hand, the source of the\r\n“highs” is different, though they reach the same terminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HISTORICAL FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THERMOMETERS\r\n\r\nGalileo discovered the principles of the thermometer in 1592. The Grand\r\nDuke of Tuscany, Ferdinand II, is given credit for perfecting it in\r\n1610. Athanasius Kircher is given credit for the discovery of the\r\nmercurial thermometer. This was about 1641. Ferdinand the II, in 1650 or\r\nthereabouts, filled a glass tube with colored alcohol and hermetically\r\nsealed it after graduating the tube. Fahrenheit is given credit for the\r\ndiscovery that water freezes always at the same temperature. With these\r\nfacts he devised a scale for thermometers in 1714.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THERMOMETER RECORDS\r\n\r\nA temperature of 111° below zero has been recorded at an altitude of\r\n48,700 feet in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe highest record in the United States Weather Bureau was taken in\r\nDeath Valley, Cal., on June 30, July 1 and 2, 1891, when the thermometer\r\nreached 122° F. Death Valley is also given credit for the highest known\r\nmonthly temperature, which was 102° F. in the month of July. Arctic\r\nexpeditions have records of 73° and 66° below zero. This is the greatest\r\nnatural cold recorded. The average temperature in the United States is\r\n52.4°; the average temperature in England is 50°.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of Australia a record has been taken of a drop of 60° to\r\n70° in a few hours; whereas the most rapid change recorded in the United\r\nStates was 60° F. in twenty-four hours. This record has been made twice,\r\nin 1880 and again in 1890.\r\n\r\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the United States Weather Bureau was\r\nat Poplar River, Mont., January, 1885, when the thermometer registered\r\n63° below zero.\r\n\r\nThe estimated heat of the sun is 10,000°; the highest artificial heat\r\nobtained is 7,000°. Regarding the heat of the sun, no definite\r\nconclusions have been arrived at, so the above temperature is only\r\napproximate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   REGIONS OF LEAST RELATIVE HUMIDITY\r\n\r\nLeast relative humidity is found in places southwest of Arizona, where\r\nthe average is about 40°. Fifty degrees humidity means half as much\r\nmoisture as is necessary for complete saturation. The average in other\r\nparts of the country is from 60° to 80°.\r\n\r\nSteel boils at 3500°; water boils at 212°; liquid air submitted to a\r\ndegree of cold where it ceases to be a gas and becomes a solid is 312°\r\nbelow zero. Professor John Dewar of England is credited with some of the\r\nmost remarkable experiments with low temperature, and at these\r\ntemperatures made some wonderful discoveries. He went down so cold that\r\nhe could freeze liquid air back into a solid; he continued further until\r\nhe reduced hydrogen, a very light gas, to a liquid. This was at 440°\r\nbelow zero. One of the most remarkable things he did was to freeze\r\nhydrogen into a solid.\r\n\r\nWater boils at 183.2° Fahrenheit on top of Mt. Blanc; water boils at\r\n194° Fahrenheit on top of Mt. Quito.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BAROMETERS\r\n\r\nTorricelli is given credit for the discovery of the principles of the\r\nbarometer. Otto Von Guericke, of Magdeburg, to whom we are indebted for\r\nthe air pump, is credited as being the first person to use the barometer\r\nas a weather indicator.\r\n\r\nBecause of the fact that the mercurial barometer is not adaptable for\r\nportability, many scientists began work on producing a barometer without\r\nfluid that could be easily carried about and would give accurate\r\nresults. In 1798 M. Comte, professor of aerostatics in the school at\r\nMeudon near Paris, invented the aneroid barometer, which he used in his\r\nballoon ascents. This instrument has been described fully on page 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BAROMETER RECORDS\r\n\r\nLowest reading taken in the United States by the United States Weather\r\nBureau was 28.48, or practically three quarters of a pound per square\r\ninch below normal. Altitude records have been taken with the barometer\r\nas high as 85,270 feet. This record was made at Uccle Observatory,\r\nBelgium, the pressure being 0.67° at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  HAIL\r\n\r\nHail varies from one-tenth inch to more than five inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from the “Memoirs of Benvenuto Cellini” of a\r\nterrible hail storm in Lyons, France, in 1544: “The hail at length rose\r\nto the size of lemons. At about half a mile’s distance all the trees\r\nwere broken down, and all the cattle were deprived of life; we likewise\r\nfound a great many shepherds killed, and we saw hailstones which a man\r\nwould have found it a difficult matter to have grasped in both hands.”\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire has the record for the largest hailstones seen here so\r\nfar; they were 4 inches in diameter and weighed 18 ounces, and were 12½\r\ninches in circumferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RAINFALL\r\n\r\nThere are records in Japan of where rain has reached 30 inches in\r\ntwenty-four hours; in India where it has reached 40 inches in\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe average rainfall in the United States is 35 inches.\r\n\r\nThere are certain places in India where the yearly rainfall averages\r\nover 470 inches; whereas other regions of India show less than 4 inches.\r\n\r\nThe higher the clouds are in the air, the larger the drops of rain when\r\nthey reach the earth.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest annual rainfall recorded any place in the world is on the\r\nKhasi Hills in Bengal, where it registered 600 inches. The major part of\r\nthis was in half of the year.\r\n\r\nThe greatest amount of rainfall is in the northwestern part of the\r\nUnited States; the least amount is in Arizona, the southwestern part. In\r\nsome parts of Egypt and Arabia, the only moisture that is received there\r\nis in the form of dew.\r\n\r\nThe average cloudiness of the earth has been estimated between 50 and 55\r\nper cent. This amount slightly exceeds the cloud conditions of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nUnalaska has a record of extreme cloudiness for one whole month,\r\nFebruary, 1880.\r\n\r\nSir J. C. Ross, an Arctic explorer, recorded a shower of nearly an\r\nhour’s duration on Christmas day, 1839, without a cloud in sight.\r\n\r\nA similar record was made on June 30, 1877, at Vevay, Ind., where a\r\nshower lasted for five minutes in a cloudless sky.\r\n\r\nA fall of yellow snow was recorded at South Bethlehem, Pa., in 1889.\r\nExamination showed this coloration to be due to the pollen of the pine\r\ntrees which had been blown into the atmosphere before the fall.\r\n\r\nAnother record of yellow rainfall was recorded at Lynchburg on March 21,\r\n1879.\r\n\r\nGolden snow was recorded at Peckoloh, Germany, in 1877.\r\n\r\nGreen and red snows have been observed during Arctic explorations, due\r\nto a minute organism that was in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature of the atmosphere is nearly 32° during a snow storm\r\nand the wind is blowing, the flakes being damp and the snowfall heavy,\r\nthe flakes are apt to unite to form large masses of snow in the\r\natmosphere or air, which accounts for some of the following records:\r\n\r\nAt Chapston, Wales, in January, 1888, the snowflakes measured 3.6 inches\r\nin length and 1.4 inches in breadth, and 1.3 inches in thickness. They\r\namounted to 2½ cubic inches of water when melted.\r\n\r\nThere are some remarkable instances of where hailstones have cemented\r\ntogether, making large masses of ice. Some remarkable records of this\r\nkind have been recorded in India.\r\n\r\nIn Morganstown, Va., on April 28, 1877, hailstones 2 inches long and 1½\r\ninches in diameter fell.\r\n\r\nThe mean yearly pressure of the United States ranges between 30 and 30.1\r\ninches when reduced by ordinary methods to sea level.\r\n\r\nIn Unalaska, January 21, 1879, the barometer reading of 27.70 inches was\r\nrecorded, and another low reading was made at Stykkisholm of 27.91\r\ninches on February 1, 1877. On September 27, 1880, a ship on the China\r\nSea experienced a terrific typhoon, during which the barometer went down\r\nin four hours from 29.64 to 27.04 inches.\r\n\r\nThe greatest temperature ranges recorded are in the interior of Siberia,\r\nwhere at Yakutsk they recorded a range of 181.4°.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable changes recorded within twenty-four hours have been\r\nat Fort Maginnis, Mont., January 6, 1886, a fall of 56.40°; at Helena,\r\nMont., January 6, 1886, a fall of 55° in sixteen hours; at Florence,\r\nAriz., June 26, 1881, 65° rise. On the northern edge of the African\r\ndesert the temperature of the air rose to 127.4°.\r\n\r\nThe lowest single temperature in the world was recorded at Werchojansk,\r\nSiberia, in January, 1885, when it was 90.4° below zero, while the\r\naverage temperature for the month at the same place was 63.9° below\r\nzero.\r\n\r\nHighest mean rainfall occurs in Sumatra, averaging about 130 inches; the\r\nrainfall of 493.2 inches per year occurs at Cherapunji, Assam, India,\r\nwhich is the largest in the world.\r\n\r\nThe lowest rainfall in the world occurs at Southeast California, West\r\nArizona, and the valley of lower Colorado, where the rainfall averages\r\nless than 3 inches.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable rainfall recorded in the United States for\r\ntwenty-four hours occurred at Alexandria, La., June 15, 1886, when the\r\nrainfall reached the enormous amount of 21.4 inches. The most remarkable\r\nrainfall recorded in the world occurred at Purneah, Bengal, September\r\n13, 1879, when the rainfall reached the unprecedented amount of 35\r\ninches in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CLOUDBURSTS\r\n\r\nOn August 17, 1876, at Fort Sully, Dakota, occurred one of the heaviest\r\ncloudbursts ever known. The water moved out of the canyon on the\r\nopposite side of the Missouri in a solid bank three feet deep and 200\r\nfeet wide. There are many other remarkable cloudbursts recorded doing\r\ngreat injury, drowning and killing many people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WIND VELOCITY\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable wind velocity records is that of Cape Lookout\r\non October 17, 1879, when the wind blew at a rate of 138 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst cyclones ever recorded in North America was the flood,\r\nas it is usually termed, at Galveston, Tex. This storm began on the 1st\r\nday of September, 1900, and lasted until the 12th. It reached its\r\nmaximum destructive force on the 8th. Six thousand lives were lost and\r\n$30,000,000 worth of property was destroyed.\r\n\r\nEven worse than any of these was the one at Calcutta in 1864, followed\r\nby a storm wave over 16 feet high, causing a death-rate of 45,000\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BLIZZARDS\r\n\r\nThe blizzard in Dakota of 1873 is one of the worst on record, but\r\nprobably the most disastrous in the United States occurred in Montana,\r\nDakota, and Texas on January 11, 1888. The loss of life exceeded 100\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TORNADOES\r\n\r\nThe United States is more liable to tornadoes than any other part of the\r\nglobe. In the United States over 3,000 people have been killed by\r\ntornadoes and thousands more have been injured. The greatest loss of\r\nlives recorded by tornadoes was at Adams City, Miss., on June 16, 1842,\r\nwhen 500 lives were lost.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable hail storm was that of July 13, 1788, through France\r\nto Belgium, and did a property damage of over five million dollars.\r\n\r\nThere have been many destructive hailstorms in the United States. One on\r\nJuly 6, 1878, at central New York extended into parts of Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island and Connecticut. Stones fell recorded to measure 7 inches\r\nin diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ROTARY MOTIONS OF STORMS\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin has been given credit for the discovery that storms\r\nhave a rotary motion, and that they move from west to east. This\r\ndiscovery was made in 1747.\r\n\r\nFranklin did not positively prove these facts, and it remained for\r\nRedfield, Espy, Maury, Abbe to substantiate the truth of this statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE FIRST UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU\r\n\r\nThe first United States Weather Bureau was established in 1870. General\r\nAlbert J. Myer was the first chief of the United States Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that we are 250,000 miles from the moon.\r\n\r\nAt high altitudes, the cover of a kettle must be weighted down in order\r\nto boil an egg hard. This is to enable the pressure of steam to allow\r\ntemperature high enough for boiling. In other words, it would be\r\nimpossible to boil an egg in an open vessel at a high altitude.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             Rain Tomorrow!\r\n\r\nYou do not like your ball game or picnic postponed just because of rain,\r\ndo you?
