I then alleged that the time was not far off when,\r\neven if the price of wheat in Mark Lane were reduced from the then\r\nexisting rate of fifty-two shillings per quarter to thirty-four\r\nshillings, it would still yield as full a return to the Western\r\nfarmer as it had yielded in previous years at fifty shillings and\r\nupward. This forecast attracted great attention, and has since been\r\nmade the subject of very much bitter controversy, especially since\r\nthe fall in prices was much more rapid than I then thought it could\r\nbe, and was carried to a much lower point than any one could have\r\nthen anticipated. It will be remarked that thirty-four shillings in\r\nMark Lane is at the rate of one dollar and three cents per bushel of\r\nsixty pounds.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I have almost been forced to defend the position\r\nthen taken, notably when asked to appear before the Royal Commission\r\non Depression in Agriculture at one of their sessions, where I was\r\nkept upon the stand for two full days in the effort of the excellent\r\nEnglish farmers and landowners to prove that the American farmer\r\nhad been ruined by the reduction in the price of wheat, which the\r\nmajority of that commission attributed to the demonetization of\r\nsilver. The whole tone of that investigation and of a large part of\r\nthe treatment of the wheat question in Great Britain has been one of\r\ncomplaint and of alleged wrong to British agriculture because the\r\nUnited States had succeeded in supplying the masses of the people\r\nof the United Kingdom with cheap bread, with sufficient profit to\r\nthemselves to keep up the supply.\r\n\r\nNow comes what may be called a cry of alarm from a scientist of\r\nhighest repute lest England may be deprived even of an adequate\r\nsupply of wheat, and lest the price should be forced to an\r\nexorbitant point. This view of the case was stated at great length\r\nby Sir William Crookes when assuming the presidency of the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science at the recent meeting in\r\nBristol. This address is published in full in the Times of September\r\n8th, the portion devoted to the wheat question filling three out of\r\nsix columns of closely printed text; the other three are devoted to\r\na complete review of the existing conditions of science. I venture\r\nto give a few extracts which will convey to the reader the aspect of\r\nthe wheat question from this essentially British point of view. Sir\r\nWilliam Crookes begins with a sort of apology, which the writer can\r\nfully appreciate. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Statistics are rarely attractive to a listening audience, but\r\nthey are necessary evils, and those of this evening are unusually\r\ndoleful.... I am constrained to show that our wheat-producing soil is\r\ntotally unequal to the strain put upon it. After wearying you with a\r\nsurvey of the universal dearth to be expected, I hope to point a way\r\nout of the colossal dilemma. It is the chemist who must come to the\r\nrescue of the threatened communities. It is through the laboratory\r\nthat starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the singular facts which becomes quickly apparent to any one\r\nwho deals with this subject in Great Britain is the inability of the\r\nEnglish farmer to think about agriculture except in terms of wheat.\r\nNow we have an example of our English scientist of the highest repute\r\nwho seems to ignore all other grain and to predict future starvation\r\non an expected deficiency in the supply of wheat. Sir William Crookes\r\nproceeds:\r\n\r\n\"The consumption of wheat per head of the population (unit\r\nconsumption) is over six bushels per annum; and, taking the\r\npopulation at 40,000,000, we require no less than 240,000,000 bushels\r\nof wheat, increasing annually by 2,000,000 bushels to supply the\r\nincrease of population. Of the total amount of wheat consumed in the\r\nUnited Kingdom we grow twenty-five and import seventy-five per cent.\"\r\n\r\nHe then deals with the impending scarcity, saying:\r\n\r\n\"To arrest this impending danger it has been proposed that an amount\r\nof 64,000,000 bushels of wheat should be purchased by the state and\r\nstored in national granaries, not to be opened except to remedy\r\ndeterioration of grain, or in view of national disaster rendering\r\nstarvation imminent. This 64,000,000 bushels would add another\r\nfourteen weeks' life to the population.\"\r\n\r\nAfter dealing with the fact that while it might be possible for the\r\nUnited Kingdom to supply itself with its own wheat at an average\r\nof twenty-nine and a half bushels to the acre, he goes on to say\r\nthat this would require thirteen thousand square miles of British\r\nterritory, increasing at the rate of one hundred square miles per\r\nannum; but he says it would be clearly impossible to assign so large\r\na proportion of the area of the United Kingdom to a single crop\r\nwithout suffering in other matters, adding:\r\n\r\n\"In any case, owing to our cold, damp climate and capricious weather,\r\nthe wheat crop is hazardous, and for the present our annual deficit\r\nof 180,000,000 bushels must be imported. A permanently higher price\r\nfor wheat is, I fear, a calamity that ere long must be faced.\"\r\n\r\nI can imagine with what a relish the Royal Commission on the\r\nDepression of Agriculture would have received this prophecy of a\r\npermanently higher price for wheat. Sir William Crookes goes on to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\"Wheat is the most sustaining food grain of the great Caucasian race,\r\nwhich includes the peoples of Europe, United States, British America,\r\nthe white inhabitants of South Africa, Australasia, parts of South\r\nAmerica, and the white population of the European colonies.\"\r\n\r\nHe then points out how rapidly the consumers of wheat have increased,\r\nyet failing to attribute this increase in part to the rapid reduction\r\nin the cost. He says:\r\n\r\n\"In 1871 the bread-eaters of the world numbered 371,000,000; in 1881,\r\n416,000,000; in 1891, 472,600,000; and at the present time they\r\nnumber 516,500,000. The augmentation of the world's bread-eating\r\npopulation in a geometrical ratio is evidenced by the fact that the\r\nyearly aggregates grow progressively larger.... To supply 516,500,000\r\nbread-eaters, if each bread-eating unit is to have his usual ration,\r\nwill require a total of 2,324,000,000 bushels for seed and food.\r\nAccording to the best authorities, the total supplies from the\r\n1897-'98 harvest are 1,921,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that while the English average consumption is\r\nsaid to be six bushels, the average employed in this computation is\r\nfour and a half bushels per head. He then remarks upon the large\r\nharvests for seven years, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Bread-eaters have almost eaten up the reserves of wheat, and the\r\n1897 harvest being under average, the conditions become serious....\r\nIt is clear we are confronted with a colossal problem that must tax\r\nthe wits of the wisest. Up to recent years the growth of wheat has\r\nkept pace with demands. As wheat-eaters increased, the acreage under\r\nwheat expanded. We forget that the wheat-growing area is of strictly\r\nlimited extent, and that a few million acres regularly absorbed soon\r\namount to a formidable number. The present position being so gloomy,\r\nlet us consider future prospects.\"\r\n\r\nHe then deals successively with the United States, Russia, Canada,\r\nand other countries. In regard to the United States he remarks:\r\n\r\n\"Practically there remains no uncultivated prairie land in the\r\nUnited States suitable for wheat-growing. The virgin land has been\r\nrapidly absorbed, until at present there is no land left for wheat\r\nwithout reducing the area for maize, hay, and other necessary crops.\r\nIt is almost certain that within a generation the ever-increasing\r\npopulation of the United States will consume all the wheat grown\r\nwithin its borders, and will be driven to import, and, like\r\nourselves, will scramble for a lion's share of the wheat crop of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for a citizen of the United States who has given any\r\nattention to the potential of our land to conceive of such views\r\nbeing held by an Englishman of highest scientific intelligence. When\r\nI was in England last summer I had a long interview with the editor\r\nof one of the papers of widest influence in all Great Britain. I then\r\nremarked that there were forces in action in the United States in\r\nthree or four different directions which would profoundly change all\r\nthe conditions of British industry, and render the English-speaking\r\npeople of the United Kingdom and the United States more and more\r\ninterdependent. It is seldom that one finds more than an occasional\r\nhalf a column in any great English paper devoted to the subject of\r\nour economic relations and to the development either of the American\r\niron industry, of its agriculture, or of the cotton production and\r\nmanufacture. Yet, in all these branches of industry, profound changes\r\nof world-wide importance, and yet of greater importance to the\r\npeople of Great Britain, are now in progress. I may venture to say\r\nthat this address of Sir William Crookes marks even a more profound\r\nignorance of the forces in action in this country than even I had\r\never comprehended. Sir William Crookes next submits the following\r\ncomputation:\r\n\r\n\"The rate of consumption for seed and food by the whole world of\r\nbread-eaters was 4.15 bushels per unit per annum for the eight years\r\nending 1878, and at the present time is 4.5 bushels.... Should all\r\nthe wheat-growing countries add to their area to the utmost capacity,\r\non the most careful calculation the yield would give us only an\r\naddition of some 100,000,000 acres, supplying at the average world\r\nyield of 12.7 bushels to the acre, 1,270,000,000 bushels, just enough\r\nto supply the increase of population among bread-eaters till the year\r\n1931. At the present time there exists a deficit in the wheat area\r\nof thirty-one thousand square miles.... When provision shall have\r\nbeen made if possible to feed 230,000,000 units likely to be added to\r\nthe bread-eating populations by 1931, by the complete occupancy of\r\nthe arable areas of the temperate zone now partially occupied, where\r\ncan be grown the additional 330,000,000 bushels of wheat required\r\nten years later by a hungry world? If bread fails--not only us, but\r\nall the bread-eaters of the world--what are we to do? We are born\r\nwheat-eaters. Other races, vastly superior to us in numbers, but\r\ndiffering widely in material and intellectual progress, are eaters of\r\nIndian corn, rice, millet, and other grains; but none of these grains\r\nhave the food value, the concentrated health-sustaining power of\r\nwheat, and it is on this account that the accumulated experience of\r\ncivilized mankind has set wheat apart as the fit and proper food for\r\nthe development of muscle and brains.\"\r\n\r\nSir William then proceeds to deal with the salvation by chemistry.\r\nBut before taking notes from that part of his address, is it not\r\nsingular to remark this tendency of the scientist as well as of the\r\nEnglish farmer to think only in terms of wheat, wholly ignoring other\r\ngrains? It may be interesting to point out the exact difference in\r\nthe nutrients.\r\n\r\nWheat flour is analyzed in the following statement:\r\n\r\n    Water                                   11.6\r\n    Protein                           11.1\r\n    Fats                               1.1\r\n    Carbohydrates                     75.6\r\n    Mineral matters                    0.6\r\n                                      ----\r\n        Total nutrients                     88.4\r\n    Potential energy in one pound    1,660 calories.\r\n\r\nCorn or maize meal differs only as follows:\r\n\r\n    Water                                   14.5\r\n    Protein                            9.1\r\n    Fats                               3.8\r\n    Carbohydrates                     71.0\r\n    Mineral matters                    1.6\r\n                                      ----\r\n        Total nutrients                     85.5\r\n    Potential energy in one pound    1,650 calories.\r\n\r\nOatmeal:\r\n\r\n    Water                                    7.7\r\n    Protein                           15.1\r\n    Fats                               7.1\r\n    Carbohydrates                     68.1\r\n    Mineral matters                    2.0\r\n                                      ----\r\n        Total nutrients                     92.3\r\n    Potential energy in one pound    1,845 calories.\r\n\r\nRye flour:\r\n\r\n    Water                                   13.1\r\n    Protein                            6.7\r\n    Fats                               0.8\r\n    Carbohydrates                     78.7\r\n    Mineral matters                    0.7\r\n                                      ----\r\n        Total nutrients                     86.9\r\n    Potential energy in one pound    1,620 calories.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that the difference between maize meal and\r\nwheat flour consists only in a slightly larger proportion of fats\r\nand a slightly less proportion of protein, a matter very easily\r\nbalanced by giving consideration to the other kinds of food which\r\nmay be used by the bread-eater. Again, it is hardly to be supposed\r\nthat the Scotchmen who listened to Sir William Crookes admitted in\r\ntheir minds that wheat flour possessed any greater potential energy\r\nin the development either of muscle or of mind than the oatmeal to\r\nwhich they have been habituated for so many generations. I doubt if\r\nany New England Yankee who had been brought up on the diet of corn\r\n(maize) bread and baked beans, the latter supplying the protein\r\nelement in abundance, would admit any greater development of the\r\nmuscle or brain by exclusive dependence on wheat for the bread of\r\nlife. It is not, however, my purpose to deal with the relative food\r\nvalues of wheat and other grains; it is simply to take up this\r\nextraordinary delusion of Sir William Crookes in respect to the\r\npotential of the wheat-producing area of this country. His theory\r\nis salvation by chemistry, and he rightfully calls attention to the\r\nnecessity for obtaining a cheap and abundant supply of nitrogen. All\r\nthe other elements for fertilizing the soil are relatively abundant\r\nat low cost, especially in this country. Our enormous supply of the\r\nphosphates of lime and potash gives assurance on this matter, and our\r\none deficiency, or rather the one element heretofore of high cost,\r\nhas been the necessary proportion of nitrogen required to maintain an\r\neven balance in the soil.\r\n\r\nI am surprised that Sir William Crookes should attribute so little\r\nimportance to the recent discovery of the influence of bacteria,\r\nwhich living and dying in nodules attached to the stalks of the\r\nleguminous plants dissociate the nitrogen of the atmosphere, where\r\nthe supply is unlimited, converting it to the nutrition of the\r\nplant, and thence to the renovation of the soil. Sir William deals\r\nonly with the renovating qualities of clover, having apparently no\r\ncomprehension of the existence of the cow-pea vine, the soya bean,\r\nthe alfalfa, and many other types of legumes by which the partially\r\nexhausted soil, especially of the South, is now being renovated with\r\ngreat rapidity at a low cost. Sir William's hopes of nitrogen seem\r\nto be based on some method being found to save the sewage of cities,\r\nbut mainly on the conversion of the water power of Niagara and other\r\ngreat falls to the generation of electricity and thence to the\r\ndissociation of the nitrogen of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe point to which I wish to direct attention and inquiry is this\r\nalleged nearly complete taking up of the land of the United States\r\ncapable of producing wheat in paying quantities. The question which\r\nSir William Crookes puts is this: He says there is a deficit in\r\nthe wheat area of thirty-one thousand square miles which must be\r\nconverted to wheat-growing in order to keep up with the increasing\r\ndemand of the world to prevent wheat starvation in less than one\r\ngeneration. It will be observed that the present necessities of the\r\nworld are computed by Sir William Crookes at 2,324,000,000 bushels,\r\nof which this country will supply 600,000,000 to 700,000,000 bushels\r\nfrom an area of land devoted to wheat of 71,000 square miles, a\r\nfraction over two per cent of the area of the United States, omitting\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\nThe problem may then be stated in these terms: Given a demand of the\r\nwheat-consuming population of the world for this whole supply of\r\n2,324,000,000 bushels, this country could supply it at the present\r\naverage per acre by devoting two hundred and fifty thousand square\r\nmiles to this crop, or less than ten per cent of the area, omitting\r\nAlaska. We could supply the world's present demand, but of course\r\nsuch computations are purely speculative.\r\n\r\nI venture to say that if a contract could be entered into by the\r\nbread-eaters of the world with the farmers of the United States,\r\ngiving them an assurance of a price equal to one dollar a bushel\r\nin London, or a fraction under thirty-three shillings per quarter\r\nof eight bushels of sixty pounds each, which would yield to the\r\nAmerican farmer from sixty to eighty cents per bushel on the farm,\r\nthe land now under cultivation in wheat and not required for any\r\nother crop or for pasture would be opened in the United States\r\nwhich would be devoted to this service year by year as fast as the\r\nconsumption called for it. In fact, there are now fully one hundred\r\nthousand square miles of land, 64,000,000 acres, fully suitable to\r\nthe production of wheat at fifteen bushels to the acre, practically\r\nunoccupied in any branch of agriculture, which would be devoted\r\nto wheat on an assured price of one dollar a bushel in Mark Lane,\r\nyielding 960,000,000 bushels. Or, to limit the question yet more: Sir\r\nWilliam Crookes states the needs of the people of the United Kingdom\r\nat the present time to be 240,000,000 bushels, increasing at a rate\r\nof less than two per cent per annum, of which twenty-five per cent\r\nis derived from her own soil. If John Bull, in place of building\r\ngranaries, could offer thirty-three shillings a quarter, or one\r\ndollar a bushel, in London as a permanent price for the next thirty\r\nyears, would not Uncle Sam accept the offer? and if Uncle Sam should\r\nthen ask for bids among the States, are there not several single\r\nStates or Territories that would take the contract each for itself?\r\n\r\nHaving put that question, I now propose to submit an inquiry in due\r\nform in order to sustain my own belief that we can supply the whole\r\npresent and the increasing demand of Great Britain for the next\r\nthirty years with six bushels of wheat per head at a dollar a bushel\r\nfrom land situated wholly in the Indian Territory, not yet open to\r\nprivate entry, but which may soon be open when the Indian titles have\r\nall been purchased. Or, again, I undertake to say that the State of\r\nTexas can meet this whole demand without impairing in the slightest\r\ndegree its present products of grain, cotton, wool, and meats, and\r\nwithout appropriating the use of more than a small fraction of\r\nthe area of that single State which has not yet been fenced in or\r\nsubjected to the plow to the production of wheat.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better to put a more simple proposition in order\r\nto bring out what would be perfectly feasible. Let it be assumed\r\nthat the British public should really become so alarmed as to be\r\nwilling to put up the granaries which have been suggested for storing\r\nfourteen weeks' consumption, or 64,000,000 bushels. That would\r\nrequire a very large capital which would yield no income on which\r\nthere would be a heavy loss of interest and a considerable risk of\r\ndamage to the wheat during the period of storage. In place of this a\r\nfeasible plan would be to put up the capital which would be required\r\nfor building these granaries, invest it in consols, and pledge it as\r\ncollateral security for the fulfillment of a contract running for\r\nthirty years for the annual purchase of 10,000,000 bushels of wheat\r\nper month, or say 128,000,000 bushels a year, or twice the quantity\r\nproposed to be stored.\r\n\r\nThere are several large dealers in grain and provisions in the United\r\nStates who would be ready to take this contract and to put up a\r\nsufficient sum of capital invested in United States bonds to serve as\r\nsecurity for prompt delivery.\r\n\r\nAn assured supply of 128,000,000 bushels in addition to the ordinary\r\nsupply might allay the fear of scarcity and high price of bread.\r\nIt may here be observed that the low average crop per acre of the\r\nUnited States has been due to the inclusion of wheat grown on land\r\npartially exhausted by cropping or not well adapted to this grain.\r\nThe all-wheat as well as the all-cotton and all-tobacco methods of\r\nignorant farming or cropping year after year are now very rapidly\r\ngiving place to varied crops coupled with an increase of product\r\nper acre. No agency has been of such service in this matter as the\r\nAgricultural Experiment Stations, now established in almost every\r\nState under the supervision of men of the highest capacity. Under\r\nthis system wheat, which requires a few days of machine work in the\r\nspring and autumn, occupying very little time of the farmer himself,\r\nis rapidly becoming the surplus or money crop of farms otherwise\r\nmaintained on the alternate products. Under such cultivation an\r\naverage crop of twenty bushels to the acre would be assured, in many\r\nsections much more. One hundred and twenty-eight million bushels\r\nat twenty bushels per acre would require 6,400,000 acres, or ten\r\nthousand square miles. As an alternate with other crops in a rotation\r\nof four, this would call for only forty thousand square miles in\r\nvaried farming. In order to satisfy the anxieties of Sir William\r\nCrookes lest land should be taken from other necessary work, this\r\narea might be divided among several States and Territories, say five\r\nthousand square miles among eight. Oklahoma (38,719 square miles)\r\nwas opened to settlement only seven years since, and has yet a great\r\ndeal of unoccupied land. It will this year raise 13,000,000 bushels\r\nof wheat from 850 square miles devoted to the crop. Give Oklahoma\r\nfive thousand square miles, the unoccupied Indian Territory (30,272\r\nsquare miles) would take all the rest as soon as open; but we may\r\nonly assign five thousand square miles to that area. Five thousand\r\nmore might be assigned to the limestone section of Virginia, in the\r\nvalley of the Shenandoah and its tributaries; five thousand each to\r\nKentucky (40,400 square miles) and Tennessee (42,050 square miles),\r\nwhile the great wheat-growing States--Kansas (82,080 square miles),\r\nNebraska (77,510 square miles), Minnesota (83,365 square miles),\r\nand the two Dakotas (148,445 square miles)--would compete for the\r\ncontract each to open a little patch of five thousand square miles,\r\nnot yet adjacent to railways. We should thus have exhausted the area\r\ncalled for without regard to the instant competition which would come\r\nfrom California (158,360 square miles), Oregon (96,030 square miles),\r\nand Washington (69,180 square miles), and probably from Pennsylvania\r\n(45,215 square miles) and other Eastern or Southern States. At a\r\ndollar per bushel in London no difficulty would be found in placing\r\nthis contract even without resort to Texas (265,780 square miles),\r\nwhich could take the whole on but a small portion of its area not yet\r\nunder the plow.\r\n\r\nThe only additional measure which would then be required would be\r\none which must come in any event--namely, the neutralization of\r\nthe ports of export and import of food in the United States and\r\nGreat Britain and in such other countries as may choose to join,\r\ntogether with the neutralization of a ferry or sea way for the\r\ntransportation of the food, wherein no hostile shot should be fired\r\nand no seizure of private property permitted on the part of any\r\nnation, the condition of this understanding being that if any other\r\nnation ventured to question or contest this dedication of a neutral\r\nway for the conveyance of food to the purposes of peace, the navies\r\nof Great Britain and of the United States would be united to force\r\nits acceptance, and to sweep from the ocean the fleet of every state\r\nor nation which ventured to contest this measure. That would be a\r\nsuitable measure for beginning to make a right use of navies--for\r\nthe protection of commerce and for the destruction of every fleet or\r\nvessel which did not accept the principle that private property not\r\ncontraband of war should be exempt from seizure upon the high seas,\r\ncoupled with a declaration limiting contraband of war so that it may\r\nnever be made to include customary articles of commerce, especially\r\nfood, not now contraband.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing text was set in type and one hundred advance proof\r\nsheets were supplied, which have been sent by the writer to the\r\nSecretaries of Agriculture and the chiefs of the Agricultural\r\nExperiment Stations in all the States to which we look for any\r\nconsiderable product of wheat. The replies are so complete and so\r\nnumerous as to make it impossible to incorporate a full digest of the\r\nwhole case within the limits of the present article. A supplement\r\nwill be prepared for a later number of this journal, in which this\r\ninformation will be tabulated. For the present purpose I may avail\r\nmyself only of a part of the data which have been sent to me.\r\n\r\n1. The evidence suffices to prove that there is not a State named\r\nabove which could not set apart five thousand square miles for the\r\ncultivation of wheat in a rotation of four without trenching in the\r\nslightest degree upon any other crop. 2. In previous essays, in which\r\nI have dealt with the potential of the agriculture of this country,\r\nI have very guardedly computed but one half our total area of three\r\nmillion square miles (omitting Alaska) as being arable land, suitable\r\nfor the plow. The returns now in my hands would render it suitable to\r\nincrease that area to two thirds, or two million square miles subject\r\nto cultivation. 3. The area now under the plow for the production of\r\nour principal crops for the year 1897 is given in the table below. If\r\nmiscellaneous crops be added to these principal crops, the cultivated\r\nland of this country does not now exceed, and in fact does not reach,\r\ntwenty per cent of the arable land, while from the cultivated portion\r\na progressive increase in product may be expected under the impetus\r\nof improved methods of farming on lessening areas in each farm.\r\n\r\n  ------------+------------+------+-------------+-------+--------------\r\n              |  Acreage.  |Yield.|   Product.  |Price. |    Value.\r\n  ------------+------------+------+-------------+-------+--------------\r\n              |            | Per  |   Bushels.  |Cents. |\r\n              |            |acre. |             |       |\r\n  Maize       | 80,095,051 | 23.8 |1,902,967,933|  26.3 |  $501,072,952\r\n  Wheat       | 39,465,066 | 13.4 |  530,149,168|  80.8 |   428,547,121\r\n  Oats        | 25,730,375 | 27.2 |  698,767,809|  21.2 |   147,974,719\r\n  Barley      |  2,719,116 | 24.5 |   66,685,127|  37.7 |    25,142,139\r\n  Rye         |  1,703,561 | 16.1 |   27,363,324|  44.7 |    12,239,647\r\n  Buckwheat   |    717,836 | 20.9 |   14,997,451|  42.1 |     6,319,188\r\n              |------------+------+-------------+-------+--------------\r\n    All grain |150,431,005 |      |3,240,930,812|       |$1,121,295,766\r\n  Hay         | 42,426,770 | 1.43 |   60,664,876|  6.62 |   401,390,728\r\n  Cotton      | 23,273,209 |      |    8,532,705|  6.78 |   291,811,564\r\n              |------------|      |             |       |--------------\r\n              |216,130,984 |      |             |       |$1,814,498,058\r\n  ------------+------------+------+-------------+-------+--------------\r\n\r\n  Maize     125,150 square miles;\r\n  Wheat      61,660    \"     \"\r\n  Oats       40,200    \"     \"\r\n  Barley      4,250    \"     \"\r\n  Rye         2,660    \"     \"\r\n  Buckwheat   1,120    \"     \"\r\n            -------\r\n            235,040    \"     \"\r\n  Hay        66,290    \"     \"\r\n  Cotton     36,520    \"     \"\r\n            -------\r\n            337,850    \"     \"\r\n\r\nThe area under wheat in 1897 was a fraction under forty million\r\nacres, or a little less than sixty-two thousand square miles. The\r\nhigh price secured for that crop has led to an increase in land under\r\nwheat in 1898 to a fraction under seventy-one thousand square miles\r\n(nine thousand square miles added), on which the largest crop ever\r\nknown has doubtless been raised, variously computed at the present\r\ntime from 620,000,000 to 700,000,000 bushels. The area now under\r\nwheat is therefore less than four per cent of our arable land.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop our potential in wheat it will be best to limit\r\nour present consideration to three States only--namely, Minnesota,\r\nNorth and South Dakota--from which we derive the greater part of\r\nour spring wheat. The area of these three States is two hundred and\r\nthirty-two thousand square miles, disregarding fractions. The land\r\nwhich is deemed to be suitable for wheat growing is estimated by the\r\nofficials from whom I have derived reports at one hundred and sixty\r\nthousand square miles. The crop of 1898 is computed at 190,000,000\r\nbushels, a quantity sufficient to supply Great Britain with all that\r\nshe needs in addition to her domestic production. It has been grown\r\non an area of less than twenty thousand square miles, or upon one\r\neighth part of the land of these three States only; the rest of the\r\nwheat land can be as surely and profitably devoted to the production\r\nof wheat as that part already under that crop. The fact may be\r\nrecalled that the territory which now constitutes the two States of\r\nNorth and South Dakota began to be computed separately from other\r\nStates only in 1880, when a little under 3,000,000 bushels were\r\ncredited to that territory. The minimum product of these two States\r\nthis year will be 100,000,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nOne of the authorities upon whom I rested for absolute information\r\nis Mr. L. G. Powers, chief of the Bureau of Labor of the State of\r\nMinnesota, in whose Annual Report for 1896 is the most exhaustive\r\nstudy of the grain production of the Mississippi Valley that has ever\r\nbeen made. I therefore do not hesitate to incorporate in this article\r\nhis comments upon the proof sheets sent to him:\r\n\r\n\"The probable product of wheat in a State like Minnesota, at a\r\nfixed price, such as Mr. Atkinson mentions, can be estimated, even\r\napproximately, only by taking account of a number of such factors as\r\nthe present actual and relative profit of the wheat farmer, and the\r\nprobable changes that will be made in the next few years in the cost\r\nof cultivating wheat and of transporting it to London. A few of the\r\nleading well-known facts relating to these subjects may with profit\r\nbe noted in this connection, and first a few words with reference to\r\nthe profits of wheat raising in Minnesota.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be true of wheat raising in Europe, or in the Atlantic\r\ncoast States of America, it can be positively asserted that the\r\naverage profit of the Minnesota wheat grower has been steadily though\r\nirregularly increasing since the admission of this State to the\r\nUnion in 1858. This is evidenced by the relative number and amount\r\nof farm-mortgage foreclosures in the State, as a whole, and in its\r\nseveral sections at the present time and in the past. Properly to\r\nuse those foreclosures as a measure of the increasing prosperity of\r\nthe Minnesota wheat farmer, two facts should be kept in mind. In\r\n1880, and prior to that time, the industry of wheat growing was most\r\nfully developed in those counties which now constitute the First\r\nCongressional District. The farmers of those counties at that time\r\ndepended for their income largely upon their wheat crops. Later they\r\nhave adopted a highly diversified system of agriculture in which\r\nwheat is only an incidental cash crop. The exclusive cultivation\r\nof wheat now finds its seat in the counties composing the Seventh\r\nCongressional District. The lands of this district are situated\r\nabout two hundred miles on an average farther from the markets\r\nof Europe than those of the First District. Notwithstanding this\r\nfact and all changes in the selling price of wheat, and all allied\r\nchanges affecting the wheat industry of the State, the farm-mortgage\r\nforeclosures in the Seventh District in the five years ending with\r\nDecember, 1897, were relatively twenty per cent less than they were\r\nin the First District in the five years 1880 to 1884, and were forty\r\nper cent less than in the five years 1869 to 1873. To the extent\r\nrepresented by these figures has the average cultivation of wheat as\r\nan exclusive crop become more profitable in Minnesota than it was\r\ntwenty, thirty, or forty years ago. A much greater increase of farm\r\nprosperity has taken place in those counties which have adopted a\r\ndiversified system of agriculture, and made wheat an incidental cash\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n\"The growing farm prosperity in Minnesota above noted finds its\r\nhighest development in the past five years, during which the selling\r\nprice of wheat in London has averaged approximately one dollar per\r\nbushel, or the amount called for by the conditions stated by Mr.\r\nAtkinson. This increasing farm prosperity in Minnesota, which lessens\r\nthe mortgage foreclosures of the exclusive wheat growers forty per\r\ncent in thirty years, has been the main factor in the settlement of\r\nMinnesota and the two Dakotas. It has caused the wheat grown in the\r\nterritory of these three States to increase from 10,000,000 bushels\r\nin 1867 to 190,000,000 bushels in 1898. With no added profit in the\r\nbusiness, the settlement of the vacant lands of these States and\r\nthose of Montana and of the British Northwest will move on, and\r\ntwenty-five years from now will find in the territory tributary to\r\nMinneapolis and Duluth not less than 400,000,000 bushels of wheat\r\nraised annually. Even then but a fraction of the possible wheat lands\r\nof the great Northwest will be under the plow. If a material increase\r\nshould take place in the present average profits of the Northwestern\r\nwheat grower, the imagination of man could hardly picture the\r\nstimulus to wheat culture that would result.\r\n\r\n\"With a fixed price of one dollar per bushel in London, called for by\r\nMr. Atkinson's conditions, the American farmers can find increased\r\nprofit in two possible sources: decreased cost of transportation\r\nto London, and lessening cost of wheat production in Minnesota. A\r\ndetailed analysis of the various charges that constitute the present\r\ncost of transporting wheat from the Red River Valley of Minnesota,\r\nthe Dakotas, and of Manitoba to London gives reasonable assurance of\r\na reduction in the next few years of at least five and possibly seven\r\ncents per bushel in such cost. Here is an almost certain addition,\r\nin the next few years, of from five to seven cents a bushel to the\r\nprofit of American-grown wheat, providing only its average selling\r\nprice in London remains practically unchanged.\r\n\r\n\"A careful study of farm methods among Minnesota farmers discloses\r\nthis fact: Some wheat growers, with the best farm machinery, and\r\nemploying the best methods of agriculture, make a profit in wheat\r\nraising of from ten to fifteen cents a bushel more than do their\r\nless intelligent and less progressive neighbors. Now, the tendency\r\nin the State and throughout the Northwest is to bring, by education\r\nand a general exchange of methods, the poorer farmers up to the\r\nlevel of the best. This change is rapidly taking place. It will not\r\nrequire fifteen years to realize its consummation. When the methods\r\nand facilities of the average farmer are brought up to the level of\r\nthe best of the present time, this change, with the change above\r\nnoted in transportation charges, will add to the average profit of\r\nMinnesota farmers in growing wheat a total of not less than fifteen\r\nand possibly of over twenty cents a bushel. Such a change would\r\nmore than double the existing net profit of the wheat grower in\r\nthe Northwest. Could it be maintained for a series of years, as is\r\npresupposed under Mr. Atkinson's supposition of London prices, it\r\nwould furnish such an incentive to wheat growing in Minnesota and\r\nthe surrounding territory as has as yet never been experienced. A\r\nmillion families of immigrants would pour into the great Northwest\r\nwithin the next twenty to twenty-five years. They would take up all\r\nthe existing vacant lands of Minnesota and the Dakotas. The lands\r\nsuitable for irrigation in these States and in Montana would be set\r\nto growing wheat. The wave of humanity anxious to raise wheat for\r\na dollar a bushel in London would sweep past the boundaries of the\r\nfour States mentioned, and carry the cultivation of that cereal all\r\nover Manitoba, Assiniboia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. In these four\r\nBritish provinces and in the four American States, dollar wheat in\r\nLondon would in twenty years open more acres of good land to wheat\r\nthan are now subject to the plow within their borders. Even then the\r\nbeginning only would have been made to the possibilities of wheat\r\nculture in the British Northwest. Settlements would not have extended\r\nas far north as St. Petersburg in Russia; neither would settlers\r\nhave trenched upon the lands with a climate as severe as that of the\r\nRussian metropolis.\r\n\r\n\"The foregoing is a brief statement of what dollar wheat in London\r\nwould do for one section of North America in stimulating wheat\r\ncultivation. If that statement is based upon a true conception, as\r\nthe writer believes it is, of the possibilities of the American\r\nNorthwest, it demonstrates how impossible it will be to maintain\r\ndollar wheat in London for any great length of time in the future.\r\nIt also shows that Mr. Atkinson is wrong in not asserting a sure\r\ncontinuation of that decline in wheat prices which he so fully\r\npredicted in 1880.\"\r\n\r\n_Cost of Shipping Wheat per Bushel from Moorhead, an Interior Point\r\nin Minnesota, to Liverpool._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+-----------+-------------\r\n                           | On May  | On July | On August | On September\r\n                           |27, 1898.| 9, 1898.| 20, 1898. |  17, 1898.\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+-----------+-------------\r\n                           |  Cts.   |  Cts.   |   Cts.    |    Cts.\r\n                           | per bu. | per bu. |  per bu.  |   per bu.\r\n  Rate, Moorhead to Duluth |   9.30  |   9.30  |   8.70    |    8.70\r\n  Duluth elevator and      |         |         |           |\r\n    inspection charges     |   0.80  |   0.80  |   0.80    |    0.80\r\n  Lake freight, Duluth to  |         |         |           |\r\n    Buffalo                |   1.40  |   1.25  |   1.25    |    1.75\r\n  Elevator charges and     |         |         |           |\r\n    commission at Buffalo  |   1.00  |   1.00  |   1.00    |    1.00\r\n  Canal freight, Buffalo   |         |         |           |\r\n    to New York            |   3.00  |   3.00  |   2.75    |    2.50\r\n  Elevator charges, etc.,  |         |         |           |\r\n    in New York            |   2.00  |   2.00  |   2.00    |    2.00\r\n  Ocean freight, New York  |         |         |           |\r\n    to Liverpool           |   8.00  |   3.50  |   4.50    |    6.00\r\n                           |---------|---------|-----------|-------------\r\n        Totals             |  25.50  |  20.85  |  21.00    |   22.75\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+-----------+-------------\r\n                General average, 22.525 cents per bushel.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that Mr. Powers says I am wrong in not asserting\r\na sure continuation of the decline in the price of wheat which I\r\npredicted in 1880. In setting up one dollar a bushel in London as the\r\nstandard of this inquiry, I had no thought that our farmers could be\r\nmade happy for the next thirty years by any hope of securing so high\r\na price. In my predictions in 1880 I said that the time was not then\r\nfar off when the farmers of the Mississippi Valley would secure as\r\nlarge a remuneration from their wheat at thirty-four shillings per\r\nquarter in London as they had been gaining from a previous average\r\nof fifty-two shillings. I might then have fixed the lessened price\r\nat twenty-eight shillings, and at the present time I have a greater\r\nexpectation of a reduction in the price of wheat in Mark Lane to less\r\nthan twenty-eight shillings a quarter, or eighty-five cents a bushel,\r\nthan I had in 1880 that it would so soon reach thirty-four shillings.\r\nI merely adopted a dollar a bushel as an arbitrary standard on which\r\nan abundant supply of bread at low cost would be absolutely assured\r\nto the people of England.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as I stated before the Royal Commission on Depression of\r\nAgriculture, it is not probable that a reduction in the price of\r\nwheat to forty cents a bushel on Western farms or sixty-five to\r\nseventy cents a bushel in England would stop the growth of this\r\ngrain, although it might check an increase. When the price went down\r\nto a very low point on the last excessive crop it is probable that\r\n100,000,000 bushels of wheat were fed to swine and to cattle. It\r\nproved to make better pork and beef than maize or Indian corn, and,\r\nas the price of meat did not decline in anything like the proportion\r\nto the price of wheat, the farmers who thus fed their excess secured\r\na profit which the sale of the crude grain might not have given.\r\n\r\nIn this comment Mr. Powers deals with the reduction in the number\r\nof foreclosures in Minnesota. Attention should be called to the\r\nfact that the United States census investigation for which a\r\nmillion dollars was appropriated, for the purpose of recording\r\nfarm mortgages in 1890, disclosed the fact that in the ten great\r\ngrain-growing States of the middle West two thirds of the farms were\r\nthen free of any mortgage of any kind, and were well stocked; the\r\nincumbrance on the remaining third being less than forty per cent of\r\nthe computed value of the mortgaged farms. Since that date several\r\nState investigations have been made, leading to the conclusion\r\nthat not exceeding twenty per cent of the farms in these States\r\nare now under any incumbrance of any kind. In the more prosperous\r\nparts of Minnesota and other wheat sections since the substitution\r\nof intelligent and varied agriculture for the single wheat crop,\r\nforeclosures have almost ceased, such as do occur being attributed to\r\nspecial causes; while such is the abundance of capital accumulated in\r\nthis section that the rates of interest on safe investments, which\r\nbut a few years since were nearly double those prevailing in the\r\nseaboard commercial cities, are now about even. When certain causes\r\nlately produced a short stringency in the money markets of the East,\r\nremittances were made from these Western cities for investment in\r\nEastern commercial paper.\r\n\r\nIn regard to wheat production at a fixed price in London, the\r\nCommissioner of Agriculture and Labor of North Dakota remarks: \"Wheat\r\nat one dollar per bushel in London would net the North Dakota farmer\r\non the average about seventy-five cents per bushel on the railroad\r\ntrack. At that price as a standard, every farmer in the State would\r\nutilize all the land he has, and buy up more of the land now lying\r\nidle and in the hands of speculators. It would increase immigration\r\nso that nearly all the vacant Government land would be taken up. We\r\nalso have over one million acres of school and State land, of which\r\nat least eighty per cent is suitable for raising wheat. Such a price\r\nwould give North Dakota a boom that never had its equal.\"\r\n\r\nA few words may be given to the report from Texas. The Secretary of\r\nthe Board of Agriculture states that \"the area of arable land of\r\nfair quality, including pasture that might be put under the plow in\r\nthis State, is two hundred thousand square miles; about one hundred\r\nthousand square miles suitable for wheat and other grains lying north\r\nof parallel 31°; about one hundred thousand square miles lying south\r\nof that line adapted to cotton, sugar, fruits, and vegetables of all\r\nkinds.\"\r\n\r\nAn unexpected reply comes from Idaho, as yet insignificant in wheat\r\nproduction, stating that the potential of that State under the\r\nconditions named might reach 400,000,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nAgain, from Arkansas, to which State we have looked more for\r\nexcellent cotton than for grain, \"there are fifteen million acres\r\nof good wheat land; wheat is fast becoming a cash crop, displacing\r\ncotton--the capacity of a considerable part of the land at the\r\nbeginning being forty bushels to the acre, which, being much better\r\nthan five-cent cotton, is leading the farmers to take advantage of\r\nexisting prices.\"\r\n\r\nTime has not sufficed since my questions were sent out for replies to\r\nreach me from Oregon, Washington, and Montana, where the potential in\r\nwheat production is probably equal to that of Minnesota, North and\r\nSouth Dakota combined.\r\n\r\nSir William Crookes makes reference to the future necessity of\r\nproviding fertilizers, a matter to which the closest attention is\r\nnow being given by the cultivation of renovating crops. But regard\r\nmust be given to the fact that we have the most complete and adequate\r\nsupply of phosphate of lime and phosphate of potash in the vast\r\ndeposits of bone or mineral phosphates of Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\nand Florida, while again we may look to nitrate of soda as a very\r\ninexpensive source of nitrogen, of which the most adequate supply can\r\nbe assured at very low cost. Known methods are also being applied to\r\nsaving the enormous waste of nitrogen from our coke ovens and iron\r\nfurnaces.\r\n\r\nI almost feel it right to apologize to Sir William Crookes for the\r\npresentation of these facts. My function is that of the practical\r\nbusiness man who deals with these economic problems wholly from that\r\npoint of view, and not from the high standard of a complete mastery\r\nof the physical sciences.\r\n\r\nAs I have stated, I happen to have dealt with this question several\r\ntimes at meetings of the British Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science, and in other ways in Great Britain as well as in this\r\ncountry. I deem it of the utmost importance at the present time\r\nthat the interdependence of the English-speaking people should be\r\nbrought into view in the most conspicuous manner. In their relative\r\nproduction and conditions the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nIreland and the United States are the complement of each other. Their\r\nmutual relation or interdependence is now being recognized, and it\r\ncan not be long before many of the legal obstructions to mutual\r\nservice will be removed. The people of this country are now passing\r\nthrough a stage in their economic education closely corresponding\r\nto that through which Great Britain passed between 1840 and 1856\r\nunder the wise leadership of Sir Robert Peel, Richard Cobden, and\r\nWilliam E. Gladstone. We move more quickly, not only in acts but in\r\nideas, than we did fifty years ago. The revolution of ideas which\r\nhas followed the revolution of institutions in the Southern States\r\nhas made the people of this country into one homogeneous nation. A\r\nrevolution of ideas in regard to the conditions of international\r\ncommerce will presently bring the English-speaking people of the\r\nworld into one homogeneous body governed by the same common law,\r\nthe same common principles of action, and the same policy in the\r\ncollection of revenue. When thus united, there can be no competition\r\nin the commerce of the world on the part of the continental states\r\nof Europe under their present burdens--the blood tax of standing\r\narmies and navies and the money tax of debts that can never be paid.\r\nThere have been within a few months two witnesses to the growing\r\ninfluence and power of the English-speaking people when united for\r\nthe maintenance of commerce and for the conduct of the works of\r\npeace, order, and industry: one is the warning of the Chancellor\r\nof the Austrian Empire, calling upon the states of middle Europe\r\nto unite their forces in order to remain capable of maintaining\r\ngovernment by privilege and taxation by force of arms; the other, the\r\nrecent manifesto of the enlightened ruler of Russia, calling upon the\r\nstates of continental Europe to disarm, lest they should hereafter\r\nbe incapable of competition with the English-speaking people of the\r\nworld when they become bound together by a union of mutual service\r\nand by community of interest which without any formal alliance will\r\ngive to them the chief control in rendering service by the exchange\r\nof product for product to all other states and nations, to the mutual\r\nbenefit of all who are thus joined in the bonds of peace.\r\n\r\nOn my visit to Russia last year, to meet the leading economists\r\nand statisticians of Europe, it was stated to me by well-informed\r\nmen that a plan had been considered by several continental states\r\nin the event of war to change the present international custom by\r\nmaking food products contraband of war, the purpose being to cripple\r\nEngland. To such desperate conditions have some of the European\r\nstates been brought under the burden of the policy of blood and\r\niron. My comment upon this insane proposal was that I hoped it might\r\nbecome a matter of public discussion, since nothing could so surely\r\nand quickly bring about a commercial union of the English-speaking\r\npeople, to the end that, even if no other alliance were made, their\r\nnavies might at any moment be combined for the protection of their\r\ncommerce, and for the total cessation of any interference by war\r\nvessels or privateers with their traffic.\r\n\r\nThe prime motive of this article is to remove from the minds of our\r\nEnglish friends many false impressions which I have constantly met in\r\nmy intercourse even among men who hold important positions, of which\r\nthe address of Sir William Crookes is but an extreme expression, and\r\nto bring into common view a comprehension of the resources of this\r\ncountry and of the mutual dependence of the United Kingdom and the\r\nUnited States in the supply and consumption not only of wheat, but of\r\nall the other necessaries of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RACIAL GEOGRAPHY OF EUROPE.\r\n\r\nA SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY.\r\n\r\n(_Lowell Institute Lectures, 1896._)\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM Z. RIPLEY, PH. D.,\r\n\r\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF\r\nTECHNOLOGY; LECTURER IN ANTHROPO-GEOGRAPHY AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT.--THE JEWS.[1]\r\n\r\nSocial solidarity, the clearest expression of which to-day is\r\nnationality, is the resultant of a multitude of factors. Foremost\r\namong these stand unity of language, a common heritage of tradition\r\nand belief, and the permanent occupation of a definite territory.\r\nThe first two are largely psychological in essence. The third, a\r\nmaterial circumstance, is necessary rather to insure the stability of\r\nthe others than for its own sake; although, as we know, attachment\r\nto the soil may in itself become a positive factor in patriotism.\r\nTwo European peoples alone are there which, although landless,\r\nhave succeeded, notwithstanding, in a maintenance of their social\r\nconsciousness, almost at the level of nationality. Both Gypsies and\r\nJews are men without a country. Of these, the latter offer perhaps\r\nthe most remarkable example, for the Gypsies have never disbanded\r\ntribally. They still wander about eastern Europe and Asia Minor\r\nin organized bands, after the fashion of the nomad peoples of the\r\nEast. The Jews, on the other hand, have maintained their solidarity\r\nin all parts of the earth, even in individual isolation one from\r\nanother. They wander not gregariously in tribes, often not even in\r\nfamilies. Their seed is scattered like the plant spores of which\r\nthe botanists tell us; which, driven by wind or sea, independently\r\ntravel thousands of miles before striking root or becoming fecund.\r\nTrue, the Jews bunch wherever possible. This is often a necessity\r\nimposed for self-preservation; but in their enforced migrations their\r\nassociations must change kaleidoscopically from place to place.\r\nNot all has been said even yet of the unique achievement of this\r\nlandless people. That the Jews have preserved their individuality\r\ndespite all mutations of environment goes without saying. They have\r\ndone more. They have accomplished this without absolute unity of\r\nlanguage. Forced of necessity to adopt the speech of their immediate\r\nneighbors, they have only where congregated in sufficient numbers\r\nbeen able either to preserve or to evolve a distinctive speech. In\r\nSpain and the Balkan states they make use of Spanish; in Russia and\r\nPoland they speak a corrupt German; and in the interior of Morocco,\r\nArabic. Nevertheless, despite these discouragements of every kind,\r\nthey still constitute a distinctive social unit wherever they chance\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nThis social individuality of the Jews is of a peculiar sort. Bereft\r\nof linguistic and geographical support, it could not be political.\r\nThe nineteenth century, says Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu, is the age of\r\nnationality; meaning obviously territorial nationality, the product\r\nof contiguity, not birth. To this, he says, the Jew is indifferent,\r\ntypifying still the Oriental tribal idea. As a result he is out of\r\nharmony with his environment. An element of dislike of a political\r\nnature on the part of the Christian is added to the irreconcilability\r\nof religious belief. It has ever been the Aryan versus the Semite in\r\nreligion throughout all history, as Renan has observed; and to-day it\r\nhas also become the people _versus_ the nation, as well as the Jew\r\n_versus_ the Christian. Granted that this political dissonance is\r\nlargely the fault of the Gentile, its existence must be acknowledged,\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION of JEWS.]\r\n\r\nHow has this remarkable result been achieved? How, bereft of two out\r\nof three of the essentials of nationality, has the Jew been enabled\r\nto perpetuate his social consciousness? Is the superior force of\r\nreligion, perhaps abnormally developed, alone able to account for it\r\nall? Is it a case of compensatory development, analogous in the body\r\nto a loss of eyesight remedied through greater delicacy of finger\r\ntouch? Or is there some hidden, some unsuspected factor, which has\r\ncontributed to this result? We have elsewhere shown that a fourth\r\nelement of social solidarity is sometimes, though rarely, found, in a\r\ncommunity of physical descent. That, in other words, to the cementing\r\nbonds of speech, tradition, belief, and contiguity, is added the\r\nelement of physical brotherhood--that is to say, of race. Can it be\r\nthat herein is a partial explanation of the social individuality of\r\nthe Jewish people? It is a question for the scientist alone. Race,\r\nas we constantly maintain, despite the abuses of the word, really\r\nis to be measured only by physical characteristics. The task before\r\nus is to apply the criteria of anthropological science, therefore,\r\nto the problems of Jewish derivation and descent. Only incidentally\r\nand as matters of contributory interest shall we consider the views\r\nof the linguists, the archæologists, and the students of religious\r\ntraditions. Our testimony is derived from facts of shape of head,\r\ncolor of hair and eye, of stature, and the like. These alone are\r\nthe data indicative of racial descent. To these the geographer may\r\nadd the probabilities derived from present distribution in Europe.\r\nNo more do we need to settle the primary racial facts. Further\r\nspeculations concerning matters rather than men belong to the\r\nhistorian and the philologist.\r\n\r\nThe number and geographical distribution of the chosen people of\r\nIsrael is of great significance in its bearing upon the question\r\nof their origin.[2] While, owing to their fluid ubiquitousness, it\r\nis exceedingly difficult to enumerate them exactly, probability\r\nindicates that there are to-day, the world over, between eight and\r\nnine million Jews. Of these, six or seven million are inhabitants of\r\nEurope, the remainder being sparsely scattered over the whole earth,\r\nfrom one end to the other.\r\n\r\nTheir distribution in Europe, as our map opposite shows, is\r\nexceedingly uneven. Fully one half of these descendants of Jacob\r\nreside in Russia, there being four or five million Jews in that\r\ncountry alone. Austria-Hungary stands next in order, with two\r\nmillion odd souls. After these two there is a wide gap. No other\r\nEuropean country is comparable with them except it be Germany and\r\nRoumania with their six or seven hundred thousand each. The British\r\nIsles contain relatively few, possibly one hundred thousand, these\r\nbeing principally in London. They are very rare in Scotland and\r\nIreland--only a thousand or fifteen hundred apiece. Holland contains\r\nalso about a hundred thousand, half of them in the celebrated Ghetto\r\nat Amsterdam. Then follow France with eighty thousand more or less,\r\nand Italy with perhaps two thirds as many. From Scandinavia they\r\nhave always been rigidly excluded, from Sweden till the beginning\r\nand from Norway until nearly the middle of this century. Spain,\r\nalthough we hear much of the Spanish Jew, contains practically no\r\nindigenous Israelites. It is estimated that there were once about a\r\nmillion there settled, but the persecutions of the fifteenth century\r\ndrove them forth all over Europe, largely to the Balkan states and\r\nAfrica. There are a good many along these Mediterranean shores of\r\nAfrica, principally in Morocco and Tripoli. The number decreases\r\nas we approach Egypt and Palestine, the ancient center of Jewish\r\ndispersion. As to America, it is estimated, although we know nothing\r\ncertainly, that there are about a half million Jews scattered through\r\nour cities in the United States. New York city, according to the\r\nlast census, contained about eighty thousand Poles and Russians,\r\nmost of whom, it may be assumed, were Jews. But they have come since\r\nin ever-increasing numbers, with the great exodus from Russia, at\r\nthe rate of scores of thousands annually. A recent writer places\r\ntheir present number in New York city at a quarter of a million. The\r\nBritish provinces, on the other hand, do not seem to offer great\r\nattractions; as late as 1870, for example, the census in Nova Scotia\r\ncould not discover a solitary Jew.\r\n\r\nA more suggestive index of the problems of Jewish distribution,\r\nhowever, is offered in the ratio of the number of Jews to the entire\r\npopulation. This is directly illustrated by our map. To be sure,\r\nthis represents the situation twenty years ago, but no great change\r\nin relativity is to be suspected since that time. Even the wholesale\r\nexodus from Russia of recent years has not yet drawn off any large\r\nproportion of its vast body of population. Inspection of our map\r\nshows that the relative frequency of Jews increases in proportion\r\nto the progressive darkening of the tints. This brings out with\r\nstartling clearness the reason for the recent anti-Semitic uprisings\r\nin both Russia, Austria, and the German Empire. A specific \"center\r\nof gravity\" of the Jewish people, as Leroy-Beaulieu puts it, is at\r\nonce indicated in western Russia. The highest proportion, fifteen\r\nper cent, more or less, appears, moreover, to be entirely restricted\r\nto the Polish provinces, with the sole exception of the government\r\nof Grodno. About this core lies a second zone, including the other\r\nwest Russian governments, as well as the province of Galicia in the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Empire. Germany, as it appears, is sharply divided\r\nfrom its eastern neighbors, all along the political frontier. Not\r\neven its former Polish territory, Posen, is to-day relatively thickly\r\nsettled with Jews. Hostile legislation it is, beyond a doubt, which\r\nso rigidly holds back the Jew from immigration along this line.\r\n_Anti-Semitismus_ is not, therefore, to-day to any great extent an\r\nuprising against an existing evil; rather does it appear to be a\r\nprotest against a future possibility. Germany shudders at the dark\r\nand threatening cloud of population of the most ignorant and wretched\r\ndescription which overhangs her eastern frontier. Berlin must\r\nnot, they say, be allowed to become a new Jerusalem for the horde\r\nof Russian exiles. That also is our American problem. This great\r\nPolish swamp of miserable human beings, terrific in its proportions,\r\nthreatens to drain itself off into our country as well, unless we\r\nrestrict its ingress. As along the German frontier, so also toward\r\nthe east, it is curious to note how rapidly the percentage of Jews\r\ndecreases as we pass over into Great Russia. The governments of St.\r\nPetersburg, Novgorod, and Moscow have no greater Jewish contingent\r\nof population than has France or Italy; their Jewish problem is far\r\nless difficult than that of our own country is bound to be in the\r\nfuture. This clearly defined eastern boundary of _Judenthum_ is also\r\nthe product of prohibitive legislation. The Jews are by law confined\r\nwithin certain provinces. A rigid law of settlement, intended to\r\ncircumscribe their area of density closely, yields only to the\r\npersuasion of bribery. Not Russia, then, but southwestern Russia\r\nalone, is deeply concerned over the actual presence of this alien\r\npopulation. And it is the Jewish element in this small section of\r\nthe country which constitutes such an industrial and social menace\r\nto the neighboring empires of Germany and Austria. In the latter\r\ncountry the Jews seem to be increasing in numbers almost four times\r\nas rapidly as the native population. The more elastic boundaries of\r\nJewish density on the southeast, on the other hand, are indicative of\r\nthe legislative tolerance which the Israelites there enjoy. Wherever\r\nthe bars are lowered, there does this migratory human element at once\r\nexpand.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar problems of Jewish distribution are only half realized\r\nuntil it is understood that, always and everywhere, the Israelites\r\nconstitute pre-eminently the town populations.[3] They are not\r\nwidely disseminated among the agricultural districts, but congregate\r\nin the commercial centers. It is an unalterable characteristic of\r\nthis peculiar people. The Jew betrays an inherent dislike for hard\r\nmanual or outdoor labor, as for physical exercise or exertion in\r\nany form. He prefers to live by brain, not brawn. Leroy-Beaulieu\r\nseems to consider this as an acquired characteristic due to mediæval\r\nprohibition of land ownership or to confinement within the Ghetto. To\r\nus it appears to be too constant a trait the world over to justify\r\nsuch a hypothesis. Fully to appreciate, therefore, what the Jewish\r\nquestion is in Polish Russia, we must always bear this fact in\r\nmind. The result is that in many parts of Poland the Jews form an\r\nactual majority of the population in the towns. This is the danger\r\nfor Germany also. Thus it is Berlin, not Prussia at large, which is\r\nthreatened with an overload of Jews from the country on the east.\r\nThis aggregation in urban centers becomes the more marked as the\r\nrelative frequency for the whole country lessens. Thus in Saxony,\r\nwhich, being industrial, is not a favorite Jewish center, four\r\nfifths of all the Jewish residents are found in Dresden and Leipsic\r\nalone.[4] This is probably also the reason for the lessened frequency\r\nof Jews all through the Alpine highlands, especially in the Tyrol.\r\nThese districts are so essentially agricultural that few footholds\r\nfor the Jew are to be found.\r\n\r\nA small secondary center of Jewish aggregation appears upon our map\r\nto be manifested about Frankfort. It has a peculiar significance.\r\nThe Hebrew settlers in the Rhenish cities date from the third\r\ncentury at least, having come there over the early trade routes from\r\nthe Mediterranean. Germany being divided politically, and Russia\r\ninterdicting them from 1110, a specific center was established,\r\nespecially in Franconia, Frankfort being the focus of attraction.\r\nThen came the fearful persecutions all over Europe, attendant upon\r\nthe religious fervor of the Crusades. The Polish kings, desiring to\r\nencourage the growth of their city populations, offered the rights\r\nof citizenship to all who would come, and an exodus in mass took\r\nplace. They seem to have been welcomed, till the proportions of the\r\nmovement became so great as to excite alarm. Its results appear\r\nupon our map. Thus we know that many of the Jews of Poland came to\r\nRussia as a troublesome legacy on the division of that kingdom. At\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century but three German cities remained\r\nopen to them--namely, Frankfort, Worms, and Furth.[5] Yet it was\r\nobviously impossible to uproot them entirely. To their persistence\r\nin this part of Germany is probably due the small secondary center\r\nof Jewish distribution, which we have mentioned, indicated by the\r\ndarker tint about Frankfort, and including Alsace-Lorraine. Here is a\r\nrelative frequency, not even exceeded by Posen, although we generally\r\nconceive of this former Polish province as especially saturated with\r\nJews. It is the only vestige remaining to indicate what was at one\r\ntime the main focus of Jewish population in Europe. It affords us a\r\nstriking example of what legislation may accomplish ethnically, when\r\nsupplemented, or rather aggravated, by religious and economic motives.\r\n\r\nDoes it accord with geographical probability to derive our large dark\r\narea of present Jewish aggregation entirely from the small secondary\r\none about Frankfort, which, as we have just said, is the relic of a\r\nmediæval center of gravity? The question is a crucial one for the\r\nalleged purity of the Russian Jew; for the longer his migrations over\r\nthe face of the map, the greater his chance of ethnic intermixture. A\r\nmoot point among Jewish scholars is, as to the extent of this exodus\r\nfrom Germany into Poland. Bershadski has done much to show its real\r\nproportions in history. Talko-Hryncewicz[6] and Weissenberg,[7]\r\namong anthropologists, seem to be inclined to derive this great body\r\nof Polish Jews from Palestine by way of the Rhone-Rhine-Frankfort\r\nroute. They are, no doubt, partially in the right; but the mere\r\ngeographer would rather be inclined to side with Jacques.[8]\r\nHe doubts whether entirely artificial causes, even mediæval\r\npersecutions, would be quite competent for so large a contract. There\r\nis certainly some truth in Harkavy's theory, so ably championed\r\nby Ikof (1884), that a goodly proportion of these Jews came into\r\nPoland by a direct route from the East. Most Jewish scholars had\r\nplaced their first appearance in southern and eastern Russia, coming\r\naround the Black Sea, as early as the eighth century. Ikof, however,\r\nfinds them in the Caucasus and Armenia one or two centuries before\r\nChrist. Then he follows them around, reaching Ruthenia in the tenth\r\nand eleventh centuries, arriving in Poland from the twelfth to the\r\nfourteenth. The only difficulty with this theory is, of course, that\r\nit leaves the language of the Polish Jews out of consideration. This\r\nis, in both Poland and Galicia, a corrupted form of German, which in\r\nitself would seem to indicate a western origin. On the other hand,\r\nthe probabilities, judging from our graphic representation, would\r\ncertainly emphasize the theory of a more general eastern immigration\r\ndirectly from Palestine north of the Black and Caspian Seas. The\r\nonly remaining mode of accounting for the large center of gravity in\r\nRussia is to trace it to widespread conversions, as the historic one\r\nof the Khozars. Whichever one of these theories be correct--and there\r\nis probability of an equal division of truth among them all--enough\r\nhas been said to lead us geographically to suspect the alleged purity\r\nof descent of the Ashkenazim Jew. Let us apply the tests of physical\r\nanthropology.\r\n\r\nSTATURE.--A noted writer, speaking of the sons of Judah, observes:\r\n\"It is the Ghetto which has produced the Jew and the Jewish race;\r\nthe Jew is a creation of the European middle ages; he is the\r\nartificial product of hostile legislation.\" This statement is fully\r\nauthenticated by a peculiarity of the Israelites which is everywhere\r\nnoticeable. The European Jews are all undersized; not only this,\r\nthey are more often absolutely stunted. In London they are about\r\nthree inches shorter than the average for the city. Whether they\r\nwere always so, as in the days when the Book of Numbers (xiii, 33)\r\ndescribed them \"as grasshoppers in their own sight,\" as compared\r\nwith the Amorites, sons of Anak, we leave an open question. We\r\nare certain, however, as to the modern Jew. He betrays a marked\r\nconstancy in Europe at the bodily height of about five feet four\r\ninches (1.63 metre) for adult men. This, according to the data\r\nafforded by measurements of our recruits during the civil war, is\r\nabout the average of American youth between the ages of fifteen and\r\nsixteen, who have still three, almost four, inches more to grow. In\r\nBosnia, for example, where the natives range at about the American\r\nlevel--that is to say, among the very tallest in the world (1.72\r\nmetre)--the Jews are nearly three inches and a half shorter on the\r\naverage.[9] If we turn to northern Italy, where Lombroso has recently\r\ninvestigated the matter, we apparently find the Jew somewhat better\r\nfavored by comparison. He is in Turin less than an inch inferior\r\nto his Italian neighbors. But why? Not because taller than in the\r\ncase of Bosnia, for his stature in both places is the same. The\r\ndifference decreases, not because the Jew in Piedmont is taller, but\r\nsolely because the north Italians are only of moderate height. So\r\nit goes all over Austria and Russia: the diminutiveness is plainly\r\napparent.[10] There is in all Europe only a single exception to the\r\nrule we have cited. Anutchin finds them in Odessa and Riga slightly\r\nto exceed the Christians. In order to emphasize this point it will\r\nrepay us to consider the adopted fatherland of the Jews a bit more in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATURE POLAND.]\r\n\r\nOur map herewith shows a general average of stature for Poland by\r\ndistricts. This unhappy country appears to be populated by the\r\nshortest human beings north of the Alps; it is almost the most\r\nstunted in all Europe. The great majority of the districts, as our\r\nmap shows, are characterized by a population whose adult men scarcely\r\naverage five feet four inches (1.62 metre) in height. This is more\r\nthan half a head shorter than the type of the British Isles or\r\nnorthern Germany. What is the meaning of this? Is it entirely the\r\nfault of the native Poles? We know that the northern Slavs are all\r\nmerely mediocre in stature. But this depression is too serious to\r\nbe accounted for in this way; and further analysis shows that the\r\ndefect is largely due to the presence of the vast horde of Jews,\r\nwhose physical peculiarity drags down the average for the entire\r\npopulation.[11] This has been proved directly. Perhaps the deepest\r\npit in this great \"misery spot,\" as we have termed such areas of\r\ndwarfed population elsewhere, is in the capital city of Warsaw,\r\nwhere Elkind found the average stature of two hundred male Jews to\r\nbe less than five feet three inches and a half (1.61 metre).[12]\r\nThe women were only four feet eleven inches tall on the average.\r\nCompare the little series of maps given on pages 172 and 173 if\r\nfurther proof of this national peculiarity be needed. Two of these,\r\nit will be observed, give the average height of Jews and Poles\r\nrespectively, dividing the city into districts. The social status\r\nof these districts is shown upon our third map. Comparison of these\r\nthree brings out a very interesting sociological fact, to which we\r\nhave already called attention in our earlier papers.[13] The stature\r\nof men depends in a goodly measure upon their environment. In the\r\nwards of the city where prosperity resides, the material well-being\r\ntends to produce a stature distinctly above that of the slums. In\r\nboth cases, Poles and Jews are shortest in the poorer sections of\r\nthe city, dark tinted on the maps. The correspondence is not exact,\r\nfor the number of observations is relatively small; but it indicates\r\nbeyond a doubt a tendency commonly noticeable in great cities. But\r\nto return to our direct comparison of Poles and Jews; the deficiency\r\nof the latter, as a people, is perfectly apparent. The most highly\r\nfavored Jewish population socially, in the whole city of Warsaw in\r\nfact, can not produce an average stature equal to that of the very\r\npoorest Poles; and this, too, in the most miserable section of the\r\ncapital city of one of the most stunted countries in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AVERAGE STATURE of POLES, WARSAW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AVERAGE STATURE of JEWS, WARSAW.]\r\n\r\nWe may assume it as proved, therefore, that the Jew is to-day a very\r\ndefective type in stature. He seems to be susceptible to favorable\r\ninfluences, however; for in London, the West End prosperous Jews\r\nalmost equal the English in height, while they at the same time\r\nsurpass their East End brethren by more than three inches.[14]\r\nIn Russia also they become taller as a class wherever the life\r\nconditions become less rigorously oppressive. They are taller in the\r\nfertile Ukraine than in sterile Lithuania; they sometimes boast of\r\na few relatively tall men.[15] These facts all go to show that the\r\nJew is short, not by heredity, but by force of circumstances; and\r\nthat where he is given an even chance, he speedily recovers a part\r\nat least of the ground lost during many ages of social persecution.\r\nJacobs mentions an interesting fact in this connection about his\r\nupper-class English Jews. Close analysis of the data seems to show\r\nthat, for the present at least, their physical development has been\r\nstretched nearly to the upper limit; for even in individual cases the\r\nWest End Jews of London manifest an inability to surpass the height\r\nof five feet nine inches. So many have been blessed by prosperity\r\nthat the average has nearly reached that of the English; but it is\r\na mean stature of which the very tall form no component part. Thus\r\nperhaps does the influence of heredity obstruct the temporary action\r\nof environment.\r\n\r\nWhether this short stature of the Jew is a case of an acquired\r\ncharacteristic which has become hereditary, we are content to leave\r\nan open question. All we can say is, that the modern Semites in\r\nArabia and Africa are all of goodly size, far above the Jewish\r\naverage.[16] This would tend to make us think that the harsh\r\nexperiences of the past have subtracted several cubits from the\r\nstature of the people of Israel. In self-defense it must be said that\r\nthe Christian is not entirely to blame for the physical disability.\r\nIt is largely to be ascribed to the custom of early marriages among\r\nthem. This has probably been an efficient cause of their present\r\ndegeneracy in Russia, where Tschubinsky describes its alarming\r\nprevalence. Leroy-Beaulieu says that it is not at all uncommon to\r\nfind the combined age of husband and wife, or even of father and\r\nmother, to be under thirty years. The Shadchan, or marriage broker,\r\nhas undoubtedly been an enemy to the Jewish people within their own\r\nlines. In the United States, where they are, on the other hand,\r\non the up grade socially, there are indications that this age of\r\nmarriage is being postponed, perhaps even unduly.[17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOCIAL STATUS WARSAW.]\r\n\r\nA second indication in the case of the Jew of uncommonly hard\r\nusage in the past remains to be mentioned. These people are,\r\nanthropologically as well as proverbially, narrow-chested and\r\ndeficient in lung capacity. Normally the chest girth of a\r\nwell-developed man ought to equal or exceed one half his stature,\r\nyet in the case of the Jews as a class this is almost never the\r\ncase. Majer and Kopernicki[18] first established this in the case\r\nof the Galician Jews. Stieda[19] gives additional testimony to the\r\nsame effect. Jacobs[20] shows the English Jews distinctly inferior\r\nto Christians in lung capacity, which is generally an indication of\r\nvitality. In Bosnia, Glück[21] again refers to it as characteristic.\r\nGranted, with Weissenberg,[22] that it is an acquired characteristic,\r\nthe effect of long-continued subjection to unfavorable sanitary and\r\nsocial environment, it has none the less become a hereditary trait;\r\nfor not even the perhaps relatively recent prosperity of Jacobs's\r\nWest End Jews has sufficed to bring them up to the level of their\r\nEnglish brethren in capacity of the lungs.\r\n\r\nAt this point a surprising fact confronts us. Despite the appearances\r\nof physical degeneracy which we have noted, the Jew betrays an\r\nabsolutely unprecedented tenacity of life. It far exceeds, especially\r\nin the United States, that of any other known people.[23] This we\r\nmay illustrate by the following example: Suppose two groups of one\r\nhundred infants each, one Jewish, one of average American parentage\r\n(Massachusetts), to be born on the same day. In spite of all the\r\ndisparity of social conditions in favor of the latter, the chances,\r\ndetermined by statistical means, are that one half of the Americans\r\nwill die within forty-seven years; while the first half of the Jews\r\nwill not succumb to disease or accident before the expiration of\r\nseventy-one years. The death rate is really but little over half that\r\nof the average American population. This holds good in infancy as\r\nin middle age. Lombroso has put it in another way. Of one thousand\r\nJews born, two hundred and seventeen die before the age of seven\r\nyears; while four hundred and fifty-three Christians--more than twice\r\nas many--are likely to die within the same period. This remarkable\r\ntenacity of life is well illustrated by the following table from a\r\nmost suggestive article by Hoffmann.[24] We can not forbear from\r\nreproducing it in this place.\r\n\r\n_Death Rates per 1,000 Population in the Seventh, Tenth, and\r\nThirteenth Wards of New York City, 1890, by Place of Birth._\r\n\r\n  ----------------+--------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------\r\n                  |        |United States|        |        | Russia and\r\n     AGES.        | Total. |  (includes  |Ireland.|Germany.|   Poland\r\n                  |        |  colored).  |        |        |(mostly Jews).\r\n  ----------------+--------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------\r\n  Total           |  26.25 |   45.18     |  36.04 | 22.14  |   16.71\r\n  Under 15 years  |  41.28 |   62.25     |  40.71 | 30.38  |   32.31\r\n  15 to 25 years  |   7.55 |    9.43     |  15.15 |  7.14  |    2.53\r\n  25 to 65 years  |  21.64 |   25.92     |  39.51 | 21.20  |    7.99\r\n  65 and under    | 104.72 |  105.96     | 120.92 | 88.51  |   84.51\r\n  ----------------+--------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------\r\n\r\nFrom this table it appears, despite the extreme poverty of the\r\nRussian and Polish Jews in the most densely crowded portions of New\r\nYork; despite the unsanitary tenements, the overcrowding, the long\r\nhours in sweat shops; that nevertheless, a viability is manifested\r\nwhich is simply unprecedented. Tailoring is one of the most deadly\r\noccupations known; the Jews of New York are principally engaged in\r\nthis employment; and yet they contrive to live nearly twice as long\r\non the average as their neighbors, even those engaged in the outdoor\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nIs this tenacity of life despite every possible antagonistic\r\ninfluence, an ethnic trait; or is it a result of peculiar customs and\r\nhabits of life? There is much which points to the latter conclusion\r\nas the correct one. For example, analysis of the causes of mortality\r\nshows an abnormally small proportion of deaths from consumption and\r\npneumonia, the dread diseases which, as we know, are responsible\r\nfor the largest proportion of deaths in our American population.\r\nThis immunity can best be ascribed to the excellent system of meat\r\ninspection prescribed by the Mosaic laws. It is certainly not a\r\nresult of physical development, as we have just seen. Hoffmann cites\r\nauthority showing that in London often as much as a third of the\r\nmeats offered for sale are rejected as unfit for consumption by Jews.\r\nIs not this a cogent argument in favor of a more rigid enforcement of\r\nour laws providing for the food inspection of the poor?\r\n\r\nA second cause conducive to longevity is the sobriety of the Jew, and\r\nhis disinclination toward excessive indulgence in alcoholic liquors.\r\nDrunkenness among Jews is very rare. Temperate habits, a frugal\r\ndiet, with a very moderate use of spirits, render the proportion\r\nof Bright's disease and affections of the liver comparatively very\r\nsmall. In the infectious diseases, on the other hand, diphtheria and\r\nthe fevers, no such immunity is betrayed. The long-current opinion\r\nthat the Jews were immune from cholera and the other pestilences of\r\nthe middle ages is not to-day accepted. A third notable reason for\r\nthis low death rate is also, as Hoffmann observes, the nature of\r\nthe employment customary among Jews, which renders the proportion\r\nof deaths from accidental causes exceedingly small. In conclusion,\r\nit may be said that these people are prone to nervous and mental\r\ndisorders; insanity, in fact, is fearfully prevalent among them.\r\nLombroso asserts it to be four times as frequent among Italian\r\nJews as among Christians. This may possibly be a result of close\r\ninbreeding in a country like Italy, where the Jewish communities are\r\nsmall. It does not, however, seem to lead to suicide, for this is\r\nextraordinarily rare among Jews, either from cowardice, as Lombroso\r\nsuggests; or more probably for the reason cited by Morselli--namely,\r\nthe greater force of religion and other steadying moral factors.\r\n\r\n[_To be continued._]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In the preparation of this article I have to acknowledge the\r\ncourtesy of Mr. Joseph Jacobs, of London, whose works in this line\r\nare accepted as an authority.

OAKLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the officers and friends of education in large cities are\r\nexerting themselves to provide open-air playgrounds for the schools,\r\nthe villages and smaller towns all over the East are reversing the\r\ncase. Except in the small district schools, the children's playground\r\nhas almost ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThis is an evil which has crept in with the tendency to centralize\r\nthe schools. When in any place the schools begin to overflow, a\r\nmovement to put up a larger building takes place, accompanied by an\r\neffort to create a high-school department; not so much the need of\r\nthe community as the ambitious dream of some principal who would be\r\nsuperintendent, or some sort of central sun to a group of satellites.\r\nThis dream is too easily realized, because it flatters the people.\r\nThen there rises a preposterous structure of stone and brick; a house\r\nof many gables, out of keeping with everything, either public or\r\nprivate, in the place; a temple of vanity. Now is rung the knell of\r\nthe school playground, for the new \"high school,\" although it will\r\nhouse all the children from five to fifteen, must needs be surrounded\r\nby a fine lawn, studded with shrubbery, and threaded by bluestone\r\nroads. The janitor has to employ an assistant to keep the grounds\r\nin order. A shut-in, penitentiarylike place has been evolved by the\r\narchitect and school committee, gratifying to their pride and a\r\ndeep wrong to the children. There are many wrongs about it; the one\r\ninsisted upon here is the abolishing of the recess, that time-honored\r\njoy of the American schoolboy and schoolgirl.\r\n\r\nThe cheerful sounds of play no more re-echo; the little ones march in\r\n\"lock step\" from the doors to the very curb of this immaculate ornate\r\ninclosure. If, on this beautiful lawn, any impulsive youngster is\r\ncaught running, or performing an instinctive hopscotch or leapfrog,\r\nhe is sure to be seen by a watching and powerful janitor and\r\nreported. Leapfrog and profanity, in the true Draconian spirit, are\r\nalike visited with the extreme penalty of a visit to the principal's\r\noffice. However, in default of a playground, the new schoolhouse\r\nprovides a gymnasium for physical culture. I speak now of a\r\nparticular school, the pride of a simple village, and a type of many.\r\nThis gymnasium is a costly room filled with elaborate apparatus,\r\nmost of which is suited only to the high-school pupils, and never\r\ntouched by the majority, who leave school at twelve or thirteen;\r\ntheir physical exercises have been chiefly provided for by a box of\r\ndumb-bells and wands. In many schools the \"gymnasium\" is a cavernous\r\nand ugly basement, a place full of shadows cast by the gloomy arches\r\non which the building rests, with walls of brick and floors of\r\nasphalt. Little troops of silent, pale children arrive and depart\r\nall day for their _physical culture_, a dreary repetition of silent\r\ndumb-bell exercises. There is no speech nor language among them, no\r\nsound is heard but the jingle of the piano and the sharp tones of\r\nthe monitor's counting. I have never heard the children count aloud\r\nor accompany the calisthenics by singing except in a private school.\r\nWhat an alternative for a free recess! No penitentiary drill could\r\nbe more perfunctory, spiritless, dead. It must be said of the public\r\nschools that the thing they most seem to dread is the sound of a\r\nchild's voice. The rude, untrained intonations, the slovenly speech,\r\nthe slouching attitude remain rude, slovenly, and slouching, for all\r\nthe school attempts to do for their improvement is infinitely little.\r\nEven the blessed relief of shaking the arm and hand to attract the\r\nteacher's attention has been reduced in some schools to lifting two\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nThe pupils generally hate their calisthenics, or, in the new phrase,\r\nphysical culture exercises. And they would hate just as sincerely\r\nregulated games superintended by some impossible master of sports.\r\nWhat they want is spontaneity in play. Public money is wasted in\r\nproviding these abhorrent alternatives. Poor little Carthusians as\r\nyoung as six and seven years are kept in their rooms, and principally\r\nin their seats, above two hours at each session, and often after\r\nthat to atone for some delinquency, most likely for speaking. In\r\nmany schools they do not leave the room for any kind of exercise. If\r\nthey were capable of demanding their rights they would call for both\r\nthe abolition of the school lawn and calisthenic basement, and the\r\nrestoration of their playground and recess.\r\n\r\nFrom the cruelty of this repression nature finds a little way out;\r\nthe children require of the neighbors what they have been deprived\r\nof by the school committee. All around the precincts of the temple\r\nof learning the trodden borders of the sidewalk, churned to mire in\r\nwinter and trampled to rock in summer, speak of the victory of the\r\nboys. There are towns, perhaps, where they all go straight home, but\r\nin our town, they gather four times a day in knots of twenties and\r\nfifties for some kind of fun. The patient neighbors go on removing\r\ncoats and dinner pails from the pickets, clearing away papers and\r\nmissiles from their inclosures, yet I discover that even they would\r\nvote to keep the school lawn; it improves the town. Very true. But\r\ningenuity could well contrive some way of uniting the playground\r\nand the school park. Spaces of grass to rest the eye and decorate\r\nthe square could be interspersed with inclosures of asphalt,\r\nfurnished with a few parallel bars and swings, without sacrifice\r\nof appearances. Often the school property is so large that it could\r\ninclude half a dozen such special playgrounds. We have but to begin\r\nit to find some feasible plan.\r\n\r\nIf the palatial school and its park is reaction against the \"ragged\r\nbeggar\" of Whittier's lovely poem, sunning in the midst of the\r\nblackberry vines of Hardscrabble Hill, it is a reaction that has gone\r\ntoo far to suit a generation which loves to read Hosea Bigelow:\r\n\r\n    \"So the old school'us is a place I choose\r\n    Afore all others, ef I want to muse;\r\n    I set down where I used to set, an' git\r\n    My boyhood back, an' better things with it--\r\n    Faith, Hope, an' sunthin', ef it isn't Cherrity,\r\n    It's want o' guile, an' thet's ez gret a rarity.\"\r\n\r\nIf it may be replied, that is not the generation for whom\r\nschoolhouses are now built, it is one which may interpret the wants\r\nof its children by just such recollections.\r\n\r\nAnother evil has grown out of the centralization of the schools.\r\nThe smaller schoolhouses formerly stood within convenient reach,\r\nand by abandoning them we have forced many little children to walk\r\nfarther than they are able to walk. In the absence of street cars and\r\nsidewalks this becomes a great hardship in extreme weather. In one\r\nvillage in New York, out of an enrollment of fourteen hundred, there\r\nwas one month last year an average attendance of four hundred. The\r\nnew school building, which had cost seventy-five thousand dollars,\r\nwas more than two miles from some part of the district, and there\r\nwere no sidewalks; neither were there paved streets or street lamps.\r\nIn such circumstances a number of children are unable to get home\r\nto the noon meal, usually dinner, and most important. Where do they\r\neat their luncheon? In their seats, watched by teachers, who are\r\ncompelled unwillingly to take turns at this duty, and who have also\r\nto eat a cold, unpalatable lunch in bad air for a week at a time.\r\nAfter lunch there is an hour to be disposed of by the children, but\r\nthere is no place to play in except the basement or the streets\r\nof the neighborhood. The teachers frequently read them a story,\r\nthat they may stretch their minds a little if not their bodies.\r\nIt is a painful sight--few more painful to me--to see a crowd of\r\nyoung children having their recreation in one of these basements.\r\nRunning and loud talking are forbidden; a police of teachers armed\r\nwith symbols of authority and punishment keep the restless little\r\nprisoners within bounds.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to the central school is the rainy-day\r\nhalf-session. Though the daily instruction may be managed so that the\r\npupils do not miss anything, it is still a fact that the majority of\r\nparents expect the school to take charge of their children, and are\r\noften much dissatisfied to have them thrown back upon their own hands\r\non rainy days.\r\n\r\nHow has it come about that the playground and school recess\r\nhave been so generally given up? Is it altogether on account of\r\nappearances? Teachers plead that the children ought to be preserved\r\nfrom association with objectionable playmates. This may do for the\r\ntouch-me-not, only child, but in American society it is never a\r\nstrong plea. That small fraction which seeks to educate its children\r\nas a class can do so in a few schools limited to church, plutocracy,\r\nQuakerism, or some such narrow basis. But the schools of a free\r\nState are, above everything, founded on the essential equality of\r\nindividuals in the State, and the possibility of every one to rise to\r\na successful and honorable manhood. If there is one conviction above\r\nanother strengthened by experience, it is that, in their choice of\r\ncompanions and susceptibility to influence, children are governed by\r\ntheir innate qualities, and these qualities are fixed by heredity and\r\nhome influences long before the school age. In so large a community\r\nas a public school there is companionship for all, for it certainly\r\nrepresents the town itself. Let no one be afraid of the democratic\r\ninstincts of childhood.\r\n\r\nI believe the playground is abolished because it interferes with\r\nthat deadly order and craze for supervision which is sought for as\r\nthe prime condition both inside and outside the schools. Order of\r\na wholesome sort is not inconsistent with the free recess of a big\r\nschool. I watched in Los Angeles a great school as it was marshaled\r\nout to play and back again at the sound of a drum. After a quarter\r\nof an hour of unrestrained sport, several hundreds were gathered in\r\nlines at the tap of the drum, facing the cheerful schoolhouse in the\r\nmild bright sun, their faces radiating contentment and good will\r\nwhile they straightened up at the mere hint of the teachers on duty.\r\nIn San Francisco I once found a certain primary school keeping doll's\r\nday, when every girl brought her doll to school and exhibited her at\r\nrecess. The school yard was a barren inclosure within a high board\r\nfence, but a joyful place to that young company. To what purpose are\r\nteachers urged to study psychology? The children in their seats are\r\nemptied of everything that pertains to their souls. Not to study,\r\nbecause the teacher will explain everything, and to behave just well\r\nenough to get safe out of school, is the simple code which covers the\r\nconduct of average children. To extend this code to ideas of social\r\nduty--the highest--is not possible while they do not form a society.\r\nCultivation of friendship is just as much out of the case; awakening\r\nof ideals, an impossibility. But thrown together half an hour or\r\nmore each day, the dead machinery that pulls the bells and adds the\r\nmarks within the school walls gives way to life; and here a man who\r\nsympathizes with childhood has all the opportunity he needs, and\r\nprobably much more than he can use, in providing for that life where\r\na code of reciprocity and honor must be established. It is not as the\r\nmagistrate he will successfully rule, but as the sympathetic general\r\nin the field, whose very name is a talisman and an inspiration to\r\nevery man. In the school yard, the bully, who comes to the front in\r\nabout every tenth child, needs to be repressed; the foul mouth must\r\nbe cleansed; against these prevailing evils the playground has a\r\nprotection the street can not possess. The boy's world is a peculiar\r\nworld, certainly, making laws for itself as rigorous and about as\r\nbarbarous as those of a gang of pirates; but it is through his\r\n_esprit du corps_ he can be uplifted and educated; the individual may\r\nbe a selfish animal; as one of a body he is capable of heroism and\r\ndevotion to a noble idea. He can be a friend; the playground is the\r\nfield for the natural growth of friendships, and youth the generous\r\ntime of their birth.\r\n\r\nI recall another scene in a schoolroom in a Western city long ago.\r\nA gentle girl, magnetic, deep-hearted, large-eyed, sat after school\r\nat her table in tears. On a seat in front of her platform were piles\r\nof slates which she had been correcting, for she instructed all day\r\na succession of arithmetic classes coming to her from the different\r\ngrades. At the same time she was in charge, for all particular\r\npurposes of their order and conduct, of about forty boys in their\r\nearly teens. Her tears were in consequence of a quarrel at recess\r\nbetween two of her boys. They had settled their quarrel by a fight;\r\nnot unlikely it was a wholesome fight, for they were not boys of\r\nthe mean sort, and were friends. It is an affair of long ago, but\r\nof a time when, in a large city, a teacher shed her influence upon\r\nthe school playground, and took account of its moral standards, its\r\nfriendships and breaches of friendship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Although white men, if they take due precautions, may live and\r\n     do certain kinds of work in tropical Africa, it will never be\r\n     possible, Mr. J. Scott Keltie concludes from the results of past\r\n     experience and study, to colonize that part of the world with\r\n     people from the temperate zone. Even in such favorable situations\r\n     as Blantyre, a lofty region south of Lake Nyassa, children can not\r\n     be reared beyond a certain age, but must be sent home to England;\r\n     otherwise they will degenerate physically and morally. A plan has\r\n     been proposed of bringing Europeans down into the tropical regions\r\n     by degrees, and acclimatizing them by successive generations to\r\n     more and more torrid conditions till they are finally settled in\r\n     the heart of the continent. But the experiment would be a very\r\n     long one, if tried; and the ultimate result would probably be a\r\n     race deprived of all those characteristics which have made Europe\r\n     what it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUP THE SKEENA RIVER TO THE HOME OF THE TSIMSHIANS.[25]\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE A. DORSEY, PH. D.,\r\n\r\nFIELD COLUMBIAN MUSEUM, CHICAGO, ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a recent number of the Monthly I described some of the incidents\r\nof a visit to the Haida and Tlingit villages about Dixon's Entrance;\r\nnow I am to speak of the Tsimshian villages on the Skeena River.\r\nThe Tsimshian Indians are one of the five great stocks which make\r\nup the aboriginal population of the coast of British Columbia and\r\nsouthern Alaska. They are shut in by the Tlingits on the north and\r\nby the Kwakiutls on the south, while on the head waters of the Nass\r\nand Skeena Rivers they come in contact with the great Tinneh or\r\nAthabascan stock. The Tsimshians are probably the most progressive of\r\nall the coast Indians, and are one of a few stocks on the American\r\ncontinent which are holding their own in point of numbers.\r\n\r\nDesiring to visit those villages which are least contaminated by\r\nmodern influence, we ascended the Skeena River to the village of\r\nKitanmaksh or Hazelton. The Skeena is the historic river of British\r\nColumbia; its name signifies the \"Water of Terrors.\" Nearly every\r\nrock, every bend, every cañon is the scene of some mythical tale.\r\nThe scene of the birth of the Tsimshian nation lies in its valley;\r\nthe rock is still revered upon which rested the Tsimshian ark\r\nafter the flood, and the \"Dum-lak-an,\" \"the new home and place of\r\ndispersal,\" is still a Mecca to which pilgrimages are made. In the\r\nmodern development of the Omenica and Cariboo gold fields the Skeena\r\nhas been the highway to the sea. For hundreds of years canoes have\r\nbeen paddled up and down its waters; it has been the highway for\r\nintertribal trade from time immemorial, and when the Hudson Bay\r\nCompany's post was established at Hazelton, and merchandise began\r\nto pour into the upper country in a steady stream, the Tsimshians\r\nwith their canoes enjoyed for a long time a monopoly of the carrying\r\ntrade. Gradually, as they learned the ways and methods of the white\r\nman, the price per ton of freight from the coast to Hazelton began\r\nsteadily to rise, until in 1891 the tariff of sixty dollars a ton was\r\ndeclared ruinous by the company, and they decided to build their own\r\nsteamer with which to carry their freight up the river.\r\n\r\nPort Essington is the chief port of the mouth of the Skeena, and in\r\nEssington we found ourselves on the twenty-third day of July. The\r\nCaledonia was up the river on her third trip, but was expected back\r\nany hour, but so delightfully uncertain is the river voyage that, as\r\nwe were informed, \"there was no telling when she would be down--in\r\nfact, she might be caught above the cañon and wouldn't be down for\r\nweeks.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW ON THE UPPER SKEENA RIVER; PEAK OF THE \"FIVE\r\nVIRGINS\" MOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\nThe town of Essington dates back to 1835, when the Hudson Bay Company\r\nestablished a post there. Its only rival for preeminence on the\r\ncoast is Port Simpson. The town in summer is completely given over\r\nto fishing, the salmon cannery of Cunningham & Son being one of\r\nthe largest on the coast, and the river for twenty miles is dotted\r\nwith canneries. In one day, while we were in Essington, the catch\r\nof salmon on the river was ninety-two thousand fish. In addition to\r\nthe cannery the town boasts of a good hotel and a Salvation Army. An\r\nIndian Salvation Army is worth going miles to see, for the Indian is\r\na natural-born salvationist; the army permits him to make all the\r\nnoise he chooses, sing as loudly as he pleases, and, best of all, he\r\nis entitled to make a speech every time it comes his turn.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, about four o'clock, on the day after our arrival,\r\na long, shrill blast of the whistle aroused the entire town, for\r\nthe Caledonia was in sight. Down we went to the wharf, and the\r\nentire town followed. What a motley crowd you will find on one of\r\nthese British Columbia wharves! What coloring, what a Babel of\r\ntongues--Tlingits from Alaska, Haidas from the Queen Charlotte\r\nIslands, Tsimshians from the Skeena, Kwakiutls from Vancouver,\r\nChinamen, Japanese, Greeks, Scandinavians, Englishmen, and Yankees;\r\nmen, women, children, dogs, and from two to six woolly bear cubs. The\r\nCaledonia is the exclusive property of the Hudson Bay Company; she\r\nis not a common carrier, and does not encourage either passengers\r\nor freight, as the tariff rates prove. There is a feverish haste\r\nand hustle about the movements of the steamer which are fairly\r\ncontagious. She makes her first trip early in the spring, as soon\r\nas the ice has left the rivers, on the Stickene; then it is a wild,\r\neager ambition of the company to have her make four trips up the\r\nSkeena before the river closes up in the fall.\r\n\r\nWe had as passengers two prospectors from Spokane, a mining expert\r\nfrom Victoria, a native evangelist from Essington, and about fifty\r\nIndians, mostly women and children, each one with a varied assortment\r\nof boxes, bales, bundles, and dogs; the crew numbered twenty, and we\r\nhad about one hundred tons of freight on board.\r\n\r\nFrom Essington to Hazelton is one hundred and fifty-two miles, a\r\npanorama of unending and unbroken beauty; never monotonous, always\r\ninteresting, it presents a river voyage which is probably not\r\nequaled, certainly not excelled, by any other river voyage of the\r\nsame length on the American continent or in the world. We began\r\nthe voyage on Sunday morning, we tied up in front of Hazelton on\r\nSaturday night. To recount in detail the haps and mishaps of each\r\nday's progress would take more time than I can command. In one day\r\nwe made forty-eight miles, on another day we made one hundred yards,\r\non another day we didn't make a foot. With plenty of water under her\r\nkeel the Caledonia could run twenty miles an hour; she could cut her\r\nway through a sand bar at the rate of a yard or so an hour; and at\r\neither rate of progress she burned each hour from one and a half to\r\ntwo cords of wood.\r\n\r\nFor the first ten miles the scenery does not differ materially from\r\nthat which we are accustomed to in the inland sea from Victoria\r\nto Alaska. Then we enter fresh water and for the next forty miles\r\nsteam through one long mountain gorge, for here the river has cut\r\ncompletely through the Cascade Range. The mountains begin at the\r\nwater's edge and rise almost perpendicularly to heights of from three\r\nto four thousand feet. Their lower limits are covered with dense\r\ngreen forests, which seem to grow out of the solid rock. The summits\r\nare smooth and glistening, and often covered with snow and ice. Here\r\nand there we can trace some tiny rivulet issuing from an ice bed high\r\nup among the clouds, and every portion of its course can be traced\r\ndown the steep mountain wall until it gives one final and headlong\r\nplunge into the river. At times these streams, taking their rise in\r\nsome extensive glacier, are of considerable magnitude, and fairly\r\nroar as they leap and hurl themselves downward from their dizzy\r\nheight. And here we learned a curious fact about the river: in summer\r\nit falls when it rains, and rises when the sun shines, so rapidly\r\ndo the pent-up snows of winter disappear and rush down the mountain\r\nsides under the heat of the spring sun.\r\n\r\nUntil noon of the second day we had been making good time, but now\r\nthe fun began, for we had left deep water and had arrived at the\r\nfirst flight of the eight-hundred-foot stairway which the Caledonia\r\nhad to climb ere Hazelton could be reached. The river had been\r\ngradually widening as one island after another had been passed, until\r\nnow it was nearly half a mile wide and flowed through four channels.\r\nThe captain attempted one channel, but we couldn't gain an inch,\r\nand in drifting back again down the rapids the current carried the\r\nboat against the rocks and, with a crash and a lurch, but minus some\r\nwoodwork, she was in the stream again. Then two other channels were\r\ntried, but without avail, although the wheel was throwing water and\r\ngravel over the pilot house. The fourth channel was next tried, but\r\nthe current was too strong. Then we \"lined her out,\" and this novel\r\nmethod of getting a huge steamboat up a stream soon became only too\r\ncommonplace. The method of procedure is this: The boat is forced\r\nagainst a sand bar and allowed to rest while men go forward in a\r\nskiff with a long four-inch cable, which is made fast to a tree on\r\nthe bank or to a \"dead man,\" a long spar buried deep in the earth\r\nof a sand bar and heaped over with bowlders. When all is ready, the\r\nboat is attached to the capstan and the wheel begins to revolve. It\r\nis tedious work and often provoking, as when the cable parts, or the\r\n\"dead man\" gives up his hold, and the whole work must be done over\r\nagain. The boat quivers from stem to stern, and the wheel, with all\r\npossible steam on, is simply one revolving ball of water. We fairly\r\nhold our breath as we listen to the dull vibration of the boat, the\r\nrumbling of the capstan, and the grating sound of the keel of the\r\nsteamer as she is being dragged through the rapids over the bar;\r\nbut above all can be heard the voice of Captain Bonser as he shouts\r\nto his Indian pilot, \"Go 'head capstan,\" \"Stop steamboat,\" \"Stop\r\ncapstan,\" \"Go 'head steamboat,\" \"Go 'head capstan!\" In four hours we\r\nhave made about fifty yards, but we are in open water again and the\r\nboat settles down to its regular chug, chug, chug.\r\n\r\nEighty miles from Essington the Skeena in its flight to the sea\r\nmakes its first plunge into the Cascade Mountains, and its entrance\r\nis indescribably grand. No pen or brush can do justice to the\r\nbeauties of the Kitselas Cañon. At its mouth we are in a broad, deep\r\nbasin, as if the river had felt depressed as it passed through the\r\nquarter-mile narrow gorge and had here spread itself out to breathe\r\nand rest before it started anew its downward journey to the sea. It\r\nwas late in the afternoon, and the western sun threw long shadows\r\nof the lofty sky-crowned perpendicular walls of the left-hand side\r\nof the cañon over against the rocky islets and ragged, rock-bound\r\neastern shore. Once we have entered, there is no faltering; \"lining\r\nit out\" is impossible here, and on and on the boat labors and climbs,\r\ntwisting and turning through the narrow, tortuous channel. A quick\r\neye and a steady nerve must command the wheel now, for a turn too\r\nmuch or too little would be fatal. One instinctively feels that the\r\n\"Water of Terrors\" is the proper name for this river, and with that\r\nfeeling comes the other--that it was never intended for navigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SKEENA RIVER SALMON CANNERY.]\r\n\r\nAfter four days' grinding over sand bars and pounding against rocks\r\nwe tie up for repairs. One of the boilers had sprung a leak which\r\ncould be neglected no longer. The delay of thirty-six hours was not\r\nwithout compensation, for the country about was open, and proved a\r\nrelief after the long ride through the high-walled river from the sea\r\nto the cañon. The banks were low or moderately high and of gravel\r\nor sand bluffs, and we could look off over a landscape broken here\r\nand there by solitary peaks or clustered mountains, their summits\r\nalways covered with ice and snow. To the far east were the pure white\r\npeaks of the Five Virgins, their summits glistening under the bright\r\nsun. Even the character of the vegetation had changed, and the dense\r\nforests of somber firs, spruces, and cedars of the lower river had\r\ngiven way to great cottonwoods and underbrush of hazel and alder.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we climbed a bluff near the river, from which\r\nwe could look off over a country that was wild and extremely\r\npicturesque. To one side of us could be seen a great mountain, its\r\nsummit covered by a mighty glacier whose blue-white ice gleamed and\r\nglistened in the sun. And there was no mistaking the power of the sun\r\nthat day; its warm rays being especially welcome after some weeks of\r\nthe cold, depressing gloom and fog of the coast.\r\n\r\nWe were now really in the country of the Tsimshians, and every few\r\nhours we drew up in front of some quiet, peaceful village, its\r\nalmost deserted cottages guarded by the totem poles of former days.\r\nIn succession we pass Meamskinesht, Kitwangah, and Kitzegukla, with\r\nnow and then a small salmon-fishing station. The villages proved\r\ndisappointing both in their smallness and modernness, and none of\r\nthem seemed worthy of any extended visit. From time to time we passed\r\ngreat black patches in the forest, the result of extensive fires,\r\nsure signs that the rainy coast was far away.\r\n\r\nOn Friday night we tied up to the bank within five miles of our\r\ndestination, but we had yet to pass Macintosh's Bar. That was\r\naccomplished on the following day, after eleven hours' hard work, and\r\nby five o'clock we had reached \"The Forks,\" or the junction of the\r\nSkeena and Bulkley Rivers. Our course was to the left, up the Skeena\r\nfor half a mile, and in a few moments more we tied up in front of the\r\nstockaded post of the Hudson Bay Company; we had reached Hazelton.\r\nThe region about us was \"Dum-lak-an,\" \"what will be a good place,\"\r\nthe home of the Tsimshians.\r\n\r\nBefore 1870 the town was farther down the river, on the flat at the\r\njunction of the Bulkley and Skeena Rivers. It has had additions to\r\nits population from Kis-pi-yeoux, and from villages down the river.\r\nThere are also to be numbered among the inhabitants the Indian agent,\r\nMr. Loring, the Hudson Bay representative, Mr. Sargent, and his\r\nassistants, and Mr. Fields, the missionary. The Indian population\r\nnumbers about two hundred and seventy-five. The town occupies a low,\r\nuneven plain, which, beginning at the water's edge, extends back for\r\na quarter of a mile, where it is hemmed in by a high bluff on the\r\nface of the second river terrace. There are but few of the old houses\r\nleft and still fewer totem poles, and they are without particular\r\ninterest. Most prominent in the village is the warlike stockade of\r\nthe company's post, with its two bastions at opposite corners, and\r\nthe blockhouse in the center of the inclosure, but now hidden by the\r\nstore which stands in front of it. The stockade was put up in 1891,\r\nwhen an Indian uprising was feared throughout the length of the river.\r\n\r\nWherever you find a trading post and a missionary you can not hope\r\nto find people who retain much of their native life or who are of\r\ngreat value to anthropology. But still Hazelton was sufficiently\r\nprimitive to be of interest in many respects. In matters of dress\r\nthe Indians are almost on a footing with the whites, but they still\r\nmake a curious garment for winter's use which is worn by nearly all\r\nof the interior tribes. This is a blanket made out of long, narrow\r\nstrips of rabbit hide, and is warm, heavy, and extremely durable. We\r\nwere fortunate enough to find a woman who was engaged in making one\r\nof these curious garments on a most rude and primitive loom. Other\r\ngarments are still occasionally made of Indian hemp, which grows wild\r\nand in abundance. This is beaten and pounded and then spun into fine\r\nthread, and woven into the desired form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TSIMSHIAN SHAMAN'S CEREMONIAL BOW AND ARROW.]\r\n\r\nIn former days the Indians used large quantities of the wool of\r\nthe mountain sheep in making the beautiful _chilcat_ blankets that\r\nformed an important part of the chief's costume, but now the Indians\r\nbuy most of their wool. Its chief uses are for sashes and belts,\r\nwhich are still worn and made after the fashion of former days. Of\r\nother garments of daily use, except moccasins, there is nothing\r\nremaining. There are a few remnants of ceremonial costumes still in\r\nexistence, and by a bit of good fortune we were enabled to secure\r\nthe complete paraphernalia of a shaman, or Indian doctor, who had\r\nonly recently renounced his native practices and joined Mr. Fields's\r\nband of Christians. In the outfit thus acquired were rattles, charms,\r\nblankets, masks, and headdresses of various kinds. From another\r\nindividual we secured the complete costume of a member of the\r\nfraternity, or secret society, of Dog Eaters. The Tsimshians have\r\nfour such societies, and the Dog Eaters stand third in rank, being\r\nsurpassed only by the Man Eaters or Cannibal Society. The chief\r\nobject of this outfit, apart from the white and red cedar bark rings,\r\nwas a long club, one side of which was ornamented by a fringe of red\r\ncedar tassels. Of interest also was the curious cap made of plaited\r\nbands of red cedar bark, and so ornamented as to represent the head\r\nof the owl. Another object secured from a shaman was a peculiar bow\r\nand arrow. These were purely ceremonials, and were only used in the\r\ndances of the secret societies. By an ingenious device the point\r\nof the arrow could be opened out, and in this position represented\r\nthe open jaws of a serpent. On the bow were two fins, that could be\r\nlowered or raised at will by means of cords, which represented the\r\nfin-back whale. The bow itself is of light soft wood, and is bent by\r\nmeans of a string passing around the operator's body, the two ends of\r\nthe bow being fastened to the body of the bow by leather hinges.\r\n\r\nIn all the ceremonies, both religious and civil, an important part\r\nof the costume is the mask. These are generally of wood, and portray\r\nall manner of real and fanciful personages. Some of them are wonders\r\nof ingenuity, being so constructed that the eyes, mouth, and often\r\nthe ears can be moved at the will of the wearer. Some of them are\r\neven double, and so arranged that by drawing open the outer mask, an\r\ninner one of an entirely different character can be revealed. One of\r\nthe rarest masks which was ever brought out of the Tsimshian country\r\nis one in the possession of the museum, which was acquired some time\r\nago. It is of bone and finely carved, while the teeth and tusks are\r\nthose of animals.\r\n\r\nHazelton is of much interest to the observer of the human\r\ncountenance, for, while the residents of the town are Tsimshians,\r\nthere is a village near by on the Bulkley River, the people of which\r\nbelong to the great Tinneh or Athabascan stock, which extends from\r\nthe Arctic Circle on the north to the Territories of Arizona and\r\nNew Mexico on the south, where it is represented by the Apaches. In\r\nsome respects the differences between the Tsimshians and Tinnehs,\r\nor Howgelgaits, as this branch is called, are quite marked, and\r\nthese differences stand out in greater relief because more or less\r\nof the population of Howgelgait spend a part of their time in\r\nHazelton, and so one sees representatives of the two stocks in close\r\ncontact. The Tsimshians, like the Haidas, are great canoe people,\r\nand are rather short-legged, with great development of the chest\r\nand shoulders. Like the Haidas, also, they have strong, long arms,\r\nwhich bespeak familiarity with the paddle. The Howgelgaits, on the\r\nother hand, are a pure mountaineer people, and are tall, robust, and\r\nfinely proportioned. Their hair is black, coarse, and abundant. The\r\neyebrows are thick and remarkably wide at the outer side. This same\r\npeculiarity may be observed in the masks of this tribe. The beard is\r\nsparse, but it must be remembered that the hair is generally pulled\r\nout as it appears, particularly on the cheeks, while the mustache and\r\nthe chin tuft are allowed to grow. Among the Tsimshians the face is\r\nwide and the cheek bones are prominent. The nose is narrow, with a\r\ndepressed root. Neither the Tsimshians nor Tinneh practice artificial\r\ndeformation of the head. With the Tinneh, or more exactly the\r\nHowgelgaits, the forehead is broad and less receding than is usual\r\nwith the American aborigines. The face is full and broad and the\r\ncheek bones prominent, but the nose, unlike that of the Tsimshians,\r\nis well formed and generally aquiline, although occasionally it is\r\nthick and flattish. Their lips are also thick and the chin is more\r\nprominent than is usual among the Tsimshians. The eyes are large and\r\nof a deep black color; the jaws are generally very heavy and massive.\r\n\r\nOf traces of the ancient prevalent fashion in deformity we saw very\r\nlittle. One old woman still retained the labret, but it was only\r\na shadow of the former labrets in size. Although the long, finely\r\npolished bone ornament which the men formerly wore in a hole through\r\nthe septum of the nose has entirely disappeared, we saw a few old\r\nmen in whom the pierced septum was still plainly visible. With the\r\nHowgelgaits it was formerly the custom to load down the ears with\r\nhighly polished bits of abalone shells, which were suspended by means\r\nof brass rings inserted into holes one above the other on the outer\r\nmargin of the ear, extending from the lobe around the entire helix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN THE TSIMSHIAN CEMETERY AT HAZELTON, B. C.]\r\n\r\nHazelton's \"City of the Dead\" stands on a high bluff overlooking the\r\ntown and valley, and commands a view off over the broken forest-clad\r\ncountry which is as beautiful as well could be. A trail winds along\r\nthe face of the bluff until the crest of the plateau is reached,\r\nwhere it divides into a right and left path leading through the\r\nmain street of the silent city. The sight is strangely odd and\r\npicturesque. Over each grave has been erected a neat little frame\r\nhouse, often of considerable dimensions. All are painted with bright\r\ncolors, and the effect is decidedly \"mixed.\" In one of the houses,\r\nwhich was substantially built and neatly carpeted, I saw through a\r\nglass window two chairs, a washstand with full assortment of toilet\r\narticles, and an umbrella, while at the rear of the house stood a\r\ntable on which was spread a neat cloth, and on the table was a lamp.\r\nOn the floor was a new pair of shoes. Over the table hung a large\r\ncrayon portrait of the departed occupant of the grave beneath.\r\n\r\nIn another house I saw chests of clothing, and suspended from a cord\r\nwere garments of various kinds, including a complete costume of the\r\nfraternity of the Dog Eaters. These five-feet-deep graves covered by\r\nlittle houses are not the usual manner of burial with the Tsimshians,\r\nfor until within a very few years the dead were cremated Even to-day\r\nin the neighboring village of Kispiyeoux the dead are buried in\r\nshallow graves just in front of the house.\r\n\r\nOf the many charming spots about Hazelton which are well worthy of a\r\nvisit, we had time for only one--a horseback ride to the Howgelgait\r\nCañon. The ride was most enjoyable in every respect. The road leads\r\nfrom the town up over the plateau through the burying ground, and\r\nthen on through a partly cleared forest of cottonwoods and maples.\r\nThen we plunge into a two-mile-long lane, the trail scarcely wide\r\nenough to admit of the passing of a horse, through a dense grove of\r\nhazel bushes, laden to their tips with unripe nuts still protected\r\nby their green fuzzy envelopes; and now we knew whence came the name\r\n\"Hazelton.\" Suddenly the grove terminates, and after dismounting and\r\nwalking forward a few steps we came to the face of the cañon. What\r\na sight! On the opposite cliff, but on a higher level, stands the\r\nold deserted village of Howgelgait, with its great empty houses and\r\nskeleton totem poles. At our feet, down a sheer precipice almost a\r\nthousand feet below, the Bulkley River, set on edge, rushes and roars\r\nand foams through the rocky gorge to join the Skeena a mile away.\r\nJust by the mouth of the cañon, at the edge of the great whirlpool,\r\nand on a gravelly beach, stands the present town of Howgelgait.\r\nHearing shouts, we looked closer, and far down we saw men moving\r\nabout, their forms dwarfed to almost spiderlike dimensions. They were\r\nbuilding a swinging bridge over the river, and the timbers already in\r\nplace looked like the meshes of a spider's web.\r\n\r\nLooking up the cañon, we could see from the opposite wall near the\r\nwater's edge, and far below us, a rude scaffolding suspended by bark\r\nropes over the river, and from this Indians were lowering their\r\nnets and drawing up salmon. One man after another would leave for\r\nhis home, his back bending under the weight of many fish, his place\r\nto be taken by another, who begins casting his nets. And so these\r\nrude scaffoldings here and all along the rivers are occupied by busy\r\nfishermen throughout the summer, for salmon is chief of the winter's\r\nfood supply of these people. In one house we saw over a thousand\r\nsalmon hung up to dry for use during the winter months.\r\n\r\nWe left the cañon for the ride back to Hazelton with keen regret, for\r\nno more fascinating spot did we find on our entire journey than right\r\nhere. On the way we encountered a woman of the Carrier tribe of the\r\nTinnehs from Frazer's Lake, who was returning from Hazelton laden\r\nwith provisions and cheap calicoes.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely entered Hazelton when the tinkling of the bell of the\r\n\"lead horse\" announced the arrival of the pack train. Second only in\r\nimportance to the arrival of the Caledonia to the people of Hazelton\r\nis the arrival of the pack train, for it brings the news of the far\r\ninterior. But of much greater importance and value is the cargo of\r\nfurs which are brought out on every trip in exchange for supplies\r\nwhich are taken in. On that day there were fifty-seven mules, each\r\nladen with two bales of furs weighing two hundred and fifty pounds,\r\nand including beaver, mink, otter, sable, and bear, all destined for\r\nthe Hudson Bay Company's house in London, there to be auctioned off\r\nin lots to the highest bidder, and then to be distributed to all\r\nparts of the civilized world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAGIVILGAIT CAÑON, WITH INDIAN FISH WEIRS AT BOTTOM.]\r\n\r\nWithin less than an hour's time the precious furs were aboard, and we\r\nbade farewell to Hazelton. The Caledonia drops back, is slowly turned\r\naround by the current, and with its steady chug, chug, we began our\r\njourney down the river, the power of the boat aided by the swiftly\r\nflowing water carrying us along at a rapid rate. If the slow, labored\r\nup journey was a revelation with its worries and anxieties, what can\r\nbe said of the down journey with its kaleidoscopic panorama of sand\r\nbars, Indian villages, far-away snowy mountains, dense forests of\r\nmighty cottonwoods, lofty heights which tower above us clad to their\r\nvery summits with eternal green, mountain streams, and innumerable\r\nwaterfalls and cascades! And what shall one say of that memorable\r\nride through the cañon, the wheel reversed and throwing water over\r\nthe pilot house, the boat rocking and swaying to and fro! Before we\r\nwere fairly aware of the fact we were out into that great, deep,\r\nsilent basin again and off on the home stretch. Apart from taking on\r\nwood and stopping at one or two Indian villages, a delay of a few\r\nhours was made to permit some mining engineers to examine a mine.\r\nThey had just come up from the coast and brought with them news of\r\nthe gold excitement in the Yukon Valley, and now for the first time\r\nwe heard that magic word \"Klondike,\" which was soon to \"electrify\r\nthe world and put the gold fields of California, South Africa, and\r\nAustralia to shame.\"\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock we were in Essington once more. \"Klondike, Klondike!\"\r\non every side. The whole country seemed to have gone daft. One\r\nsteamer after another went racing by the mouth of the Skeena on the\r\nway to Dyea and the Skagway Trail. But our fortunes lay in the other\r\ndirection, and that night we were aboard the Islander, bound for\r\nVictoria and the south.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[25] From a lecture delivered at the Field Columbian Museum, November\r\n13, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT AND VEGETATION.\r\n\r\nBY D. T. MACDOUGAL, PH. D.,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR IN CHARGE OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLight is the most important of all the external agencies which\r\ninfluence the vegetal organism, and the sun's rays have been the most\r\npotent force in shaping the development of existent plant forms.\r\n\r\nThe sunbeam stands in a manifold relation to the plant. First and\r\nforemost, light is the universal source of energy, by the aid of\r\nwhich the chlorophyll apparatus in green leaves builds up complex\r\nfood substances from simple compounds obtained from the soil and air,\r\na process necessary for the nutrition of the entire living world.\r\nSome obscure organisms, such as the \"nitrosomonas,\" soil bacteria,\r\nare able to accomplish the construction of complex substances, by\r\nmeans of energy derived from other chemical compounds, which were,\r\nhowever, formed originally by green plants. These food-building\r\nprocesses are designated as photosynthesis, chemosynthesis,\r\nelectrosynthesis, thermosynthesis, etc., according to the source of\r\nenergy used.\r\n\r\nBy photosynthesis, carbon dioxide from the air and water from the\r\ncell are combined in the green cells of leaves, forming sugar and\r\npossibly other substances. During this process an amount of oxygen\r\napproximately equal to that of the carbon dioxide taken up is\r\nexhaled. It will be of interest to note the relation of the living\r\nworld to the atmosphere. Eight hundred to nine hundred grammes of\r\ncarbon dioxide are produced in the respiration of a single person\r\nfor a day, and the entire product of the human race for this period\r\nis twelve hundred million kilogrammes. In addition, large quantities\r\nof the gas result from the combustion of the four hundred and sixty\r\nmillions of kilogrammes of coal and wood burned yearly. The lower\r\nanimals, fungi, and green plants themselves contribute an amount\r\nwhich must bring the total to twice the immense sum named above.\r\nThe atmosphere contains three or four hundredths of one per cent of\r\ncarbon dioxide, or an amount of about two to three thousand billions\r\nof kilogrammes. No especial variation in this proportion has been\r\ndetected since observations upon this point were first made. The\r\nfact that no increase takes place is partly due to the absorption\r\nof the gas by plants, and its replacement by oxygen, and also to\r\ncertain geological processes in constant operation. Absorption\r\ntakes place at the rate of about two and a half grammes for every\r\nsquare metre of leaf surface per hour, or about twenty-five to\r\nthirty grammes daily, since the process goes on only in daylight.\r\nIt is to be seen that a single human being exhales as much carbon\r\ndioxide as may be removed from the air by thirty or forty square\r\nmetres of leaf surface. According to Ebermayer, a hectare (2.47\r\nacres) of forest would use eleven thousand kilogrammes of carbon\r\ndioxide yearly, and the amount used by plants is generally much in\r\nexcess of that furnished by the activity of the inhabitants of any\r\ngiven area. Plants thrive and show increasing vigor as the amount of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the air rises until two hundred times the present\r\nproportion is reached. An increase of the gas in the atmosphere would\r\ntherefore be partly corrected by the absorption and by the stronger\r\nvegetation induced. Nothing short of a comprehensive cataclysm could\r\nwork such disturbance to the composition of the air as to endanger\r\nthe well-being of the animal inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe activity of a square metre of leaf surface results in the\r\nformation of one and a half to two grammes of solid substance\r\nper hour in sunlight. A vigorous sunflower with one hundred and\r\nforty-five leaves constructed thirty-six grammes of solid matter in\r\na day, and a squash with one hundred and sixteen leaves one hundred\r\nand sixteen grammes in the same length of time. The amounts formed by\r\nsuch trees as the beech, maple, oak, poplar, elm, and horse-chestnut,\r\nwith leaf surfaces aggregating three hundred to one thousand square\r\nmetres, must be correspondingly large.\r\n\r\nA comparison of plants grown in strong sunlight, diffuse light,\r\nand darkness will reveal many differences in stature and internal\r\nstructure. These differences are for the most part due to the\r\n_formative_ and _tonic_ effect of light. Otherwise expressed,\r\nthe influence of variations of light upon plants causes adaptive\r\nreactions, and disturbances of the nutritive processes and growth.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these facts the reaction of any given organ to\r\nchanges in the intensity of the illumination will depend upon its\r\nspecific functions and relation to the remainder of the organism.\r\n\r\nThe stems formed by seedlings and awakening underground organs are\r\nusually surrounded by plants or other objects which cut off more or\r\nless sunlight. The developing shoot can not spread its leaves to the\r\nlight advantageously until it has outstripped or grown beyond the\r\nobjects intervening between it and the light. This necessity is one\r\nof the most important conditions in the struggle for existence. To\r\nmeet it, a very great majority of seed-forming plants have acquired\r\nthe power of accelerated elongation of the stems when deprived of\r\ntheir normal amount of light.\r\n\r\nVery striking examples of this reaction are offered by the awakening\r\ncorms of the Jack-in-the-pulpit (_Arisæma triphyllum_). The corms\r\nusually lie at a distance of five or six centimetres below the\r\nsurface of the soil, and when the growth of the large bud begins\r\nin the spring the heavy sheathing scales elongate and pierce the\r\nsoil, opening when the surface is reached at the distance of a few\r\ncentimetres. If the corm should have been buried deeper in the\r\nsubstratum by floods or drifts of leaves, the growth of the bud\r\nscales will continue until the light is reached, though it may be a\r\ndistance of twenty centimetres. Such growth may be seen if the corms\r\nare grown in a deep layer of sphagnum moss, or in a dark room.\r\n\r\nAfter the stems emerge from the \"drawn\" buds they show a similar\r\nattenuation, attaining a length of twice the normal. The excessive\r\nelongation of stems is accompanied by variations in the structure and\r\ncontents of the tissues. The cells are generally longer, while the\r\nwalls are thinner. In consequence, organs grown in darkness are very\r\nweak and easily bent or broken. Growth in darkness is attended by the\r\nnon-formation of chlorophyll. This is replaced by etiolin, giving the\r\nplant a pale, waxy, yellow appearance.\r\n\r\nThe adaptive elongation is not shown by all species, however. It\r\nhas been found that stems of beet, hop, dioscorea, and a few others\r\nshow no adaptations to diminished light. The adaptive modification\r\nof stems elongating in darkness is developed from the retarding\r\ninfluence exercised by light upon growth. Thus it is a well-known\r\nfact that the action of certain portions of the sun's rays actually\r\nimpedes or checks the increase in volume known as growth, though it\r\ndoes not influence actual division of the cells to any great extent.\r\nWhen this retarding action is eliminated excessive elongation ensues.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of leaves in illuminations below the normal depends upon\r\nthe relation of these organs to the storage structures of the plant\r\nas well as upon other factors, and many types are dependent upon\r\ntheir own activity for plastic material necessary for growth.\r\n\r\nIt is to be said in general that leaves of dicotyledonous plants are\r\nincapable of full development in darkness, though to this rule there\r\nare many exceptions. Thus the leaves of the beet develop normally, or\r\nnearly so, in darkness.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, leaves of monocotyledonous plants attain normal\r\nsize in darkness, especially those with straight or curved parallel\r\nvenation. Some, as the iris, swamp marigold, and onion, attain a\r\ngreater length in darkness than in light. Here, as in stems, cell\r\ndivision is not modified, but the growth of the individual cell is\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe growth of leaves in darkness may be easily observed if the\r\nunderground perennial stems of common mandrake are placed in a dark\r\nchamber before the growth of the leaf buds has begun. The leaves\r\nare peltate, and in the bud are folded about the end of the petiole\r\nafter the manner of an umbrella. Usually this umbrella expands as\r\nsoon as it has pushed upward and become free from the soil, attaining\r\na diameter of twenty-five to forty centimetres when outspread. In\r\ndarkness, however, it refuses to unfold, the laminæ are pale yellow\r\nand retain the crumpled form of the bud, and as the petiole shows\r\nan exaggerated elongation the organ takes on the appearance of a\r\nvery small parasol on a very long handle. The imperfect development\r\nof leaves and the rapid decay of aërial organs deprived of sunlight\r\nleads to the conclusion that the action of light is necessary to the\r\nhealth and normal activity of these organs, and the light therefore\r\nexercises a _tonic_ influence upon vegetation.\r\n\r\nMany species of plants are so plastic and capable of such ready\r\nresponse to variations in external conditions that they undergo\r\ndistinct morphological changes in response to variations in the\r\nintensity of the light. The common potato is an example of this\r\nfact. The edible tubers are simply thickened stems, and the plant\r\nhas the habit of storing starch in any stems not acted upon by\r\nthe light. The branches arising from the base of the main stem\r\nare generally underneath the surface of the soil, and afford the\r\nproper conditions for tuber formation. Sugar is constructed in the\r\nleaves, carried down the length of the stem, and deposited in the\r\nunderground branches as starch. Space is made for the accumulating\r\nstore by the multiplication of the thin-walled cells of the pith. If\r\nany of the upper branches should become shaded, they become at once\r\nthe focus of converging streams of sugar, and similar enlargement\r\nensues, resulting in the formation of tubers. Such structures are\r\noccasionally observed in plants grown thickly together.\r\n\r\nVöchting, by a number of most ingenious experiments, has succeeded in\r\nproducing tubers on any branch of a potato plant by simply inclosing\r\nthe branch in a small dark chamber. As the result of one experiment\r\nthe entire main stem springing from a sprouting tuber was converted\r\ninto a new tuber nearly as large as the first. The entire plant at\r\nthe close of the experiment had the form of a dumb-bell, with the old\r\ntuber as one ball and the new tuber as the other.\r\n\r\nThe same writer has described important results obtained from a study\r\nof the action of light upon the stems of cactus, consisting of a\r\nnumber of flattened internodes. When the growing tips of such plants\r\nwere allowed to develop in a dark chamber the new internodes grown\r\nwere cylindrical in form. Such behavior suggests that these plants\r\nwere originally furnished with cylindrical stems and foliar leaves.\r\nThe leaves at some time in the history of the plant were found\r\nunsuitable, and gradually atrophied, while the stems were flattened\r\nand extended to take up their functions.\r\n\r\nSome very striking adaptations of form of organs to the intensity\r\nof the light have been analyzed by Goebel. The common harebell\r\n(_Campanula rotundifolia_) has an upright stem twenty to sixty\r\ncentimetres in height. The upper part of the stem bears sessile\r\nlanceolate leaves, decreasing in size from the base to the summit.\r\nThe first leaves formed by the stem on its emergence from the soil\r\nare entirely different in construction, showing a heart-shaped lamina\r\nwith a distinct petiole. These leaves are formed at the actual\r\nsurface of the soil, are generally more or less shaded or covered by\r\nfallen leaves, and in fact are not known or seen by many collectors\r\nor observers of the plant. Goebel found that similar leaves might be\r\nformed on any part of the plant if it were shaded from the full glare\r\nof the sun's rays. The cordate leaves at the base of the stem were\r\nalways produced, however, no matter to what intensity of illumination\r\nthat part of the plant was subjected. It is therefore safe to\r\nconclude that the cordate leaves are inherited forms, and that the\r\nlanceolate organs are adaptations to light which may be shown by any\r\nindividual of the species.\r\n\r\nIn general it is to be said that the leaves of sun-loving species\r\nhave a thick epidermis, entirely free from chlorophyll, with stomata\r\non the lower side only, a firm consistence due to the formation of\r\nwoody tissues, and are often provided with a coating of hairs. The\r\nleaves of shade-loving plants, on the other hand, have a thin-walled\r\nepidermis often containing chlorophyll, stomata on both sides, and\r\nare not so plentifully provided with hairs as those in exposed\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nThe variations in external form described above are due to the\r\nintensity of the illumination. At the same time the structure and\r\narrangement of the cells depend on the direction from which the\r\nlight rays come. Thus, an organ receiving light from one side only\r\nwill exhibit a structure different from an organ of the same kind\r\nreceiving direct rays from two or more sides. Light, then, is a\r\ncause of dorsiventrality--that is, of the fact that the upper and\r\nlower sides of organs are not alike in structure. The leaf affords a\r\nsplendid example of dorsiventrality as a result of the exposure of\r\none side only to direct light. The upper side of a horizontal leaf,\r\nsuch as the oak, beech, or maple, contains one or two layers of\r\ncylindrical cells with their long axes perpendicular to the surface.\r\nIn vertical leaves, such as the iris, these _palisade_ cells, as\r\nthey are termed, are not so well defined, and in all leaves grown in\r\ndarkness this tissue is very much reduced. If a young leaf not yet\r\nunfolded from the bud is fastened in such a position that the under\r\nside is uppermost, palisade cells will be formed on the side exposed\r\nto the direct rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe influence of light upon the sporophylls, or reproductive organs\r\nof the seed-forming plants, is quite as well defined as upon the\r\nvegetative organs.\r\n\r\nIn general it is to be said that stamens and pistils may reach\r\nfunctional maturity in darkness or diffuse light, and if pollination\r\nis provided for, seed and fruit formation may ensue.\r\n\r\nThe diminution of light has the effect of transforming inflorescences\r\ninto leafy shoots in some instances, however. The more common\r\nreaction consists of alterations in the size, form, and color\r\nof the perianth, and greater changes are induced in the petals\r\nthan in the sepals. The corolla shows greater decrease in size in\r\n_Melandryum_ and _Silene_, in diffuse light, though the relative\r\nform is maintained. The writer has obtained most striking results\r\nfrom growing flowers of _Salvia_ (sage) in a dark chamber, inclosing\r\nthe inflorescence only. In the normal flower the irregular scarlet\r\ncorolla attains three times the length of the calyx, and two stamens\r\nextrude from under the upper lip. When grown in darkness, the corolla\r\nwith the adherent stamens measure about three millimetres in length,\r\nor one twelfth the normal, and are scarcely more than half the size\r\nof the calyx, which is but two thirds the size of similar organs\r\ngrown in the light. The color is entirely lacking from the corolla,\r\nand is found only along the veins of the calyx.\r\n\r\nIn other instances in which the corolla is composed of separate\r\nmembers, an unequal reaction is exhibited. The corolla of nasturtium\r\n(_Tropæolum majus_) consists of five approximately equal petals.\r\nFlowers of this species grown in darkness show one of nearly normal\r\nstature, two of reduced size, while the remaining two take the form\r\nof club-shaped bracts.\r\n\r\nThe diminished size of the perianth of cleistogamous flowers of such\r\ntypes as the violet is due directly to the action of diminished light\r\nupon the hidden or inclosed flower.\r\n\r\nThe influence of light upon the structure, reproductive processes,\r\nand distribution of the lower forms brings about the most widely\r\ndivergent reactions, which can not be described here.\r\n\r\nThe distribution and color of marine algæ depend upon the depth of\r\nthe water and the consequent intensity of the light. This gives\r\nrise to distinct zones of aquatic vegetation. Thus in one series of\r\nsurveys the _littoral_ zone, the beach area covered at high water\r\nand exposed at low water, was found to furnish proper conditions\r\nfor green, brown, and red algæ. The _sublittoral_ zone, extending\r\nto a depth of forty metres, is furnished with red algæ, increasing\r\nin number with the depth, and the brown algæ disappear; while\r\nthe _elittoral_ zone, from forty to one hundred and ten metres,\r\nis inhabited by red algæ alone. The number of species of vegetal\r\norganisms below this depth is extremely small. An alga (_Halosphæria\r\nviridis_) has been brought up from depths of one thousand to two\r\nthousand metres.\r\n\r\nA very great number of bacteria are unfavorably affected by light,\r\nand find proper conditions at some depth in the soil or water. It\r\nis on account of this fact that the water of frozen streams becomes\r\nmore thickly inhabited by certain organisms than in the summer\r\ntime, and exposure to sunlight is adopted as a hygienic measure in\r\nfreeing clothing and household effects from infection. Bacteria occur\r\nabundantly in sea water at depths of two hundred to four hundred\r\nmetres, and quite a number of species are to be found at eight\r\nhundred to eleven hundred metres.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of fungi follows the general habit of bacteria in\r\nthat they thrive best in darkness.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noticed in this connection that light is also a\r\ndetermining factor in the distribution of the higher land plants.\r\nThus the amount of light received in polar latitudes is quite\r\ninsufficient for the needs of many species, entirely irrespective of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe retarding influence of light upon growth is even more marked in\r\nthe lower forms than in the higher. Such action is the result of\r\nthe disintegrating effect of the blue-violet rays upon ferments and\r\nnitrogenous plastic substances.\r\n\r\nThe greater massiveness of the bodies of the higher plants enables\r\nthem to carry on the chemical activities in which these substances\r\nare concerned in the interior, where the intense rays may not\r\npenetrate. The attenuated and undifferentiated fungi must seek the\r\nshade, to escape the dangers of strong light, against which they have\r\nno shield.\r\n\r\nThe reproductive processes are particularly sensitive to\r\nillumination. The formation of zoöspores by green felt (_Vaucheria_)\r\nmay occur only in darkness, at night, or in diffuse light, and these\r\nexamples might be multiplied indefinitely. Many features of the\r\ngermination of spores and the growth of _protonemæ_ or _prothallia_\r\namong the mosses, liverworts, and ferns are determined by light.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking reactions of plants to light are to be seen\r\nin locomotor and orientation movements.\r\n\r\nLocomotor movements are chiefly confined to lower forms, and are most\r\nnoticeable in the \"swarm spores,\" or zoöspores of the algæ, though\r\nexhibited by spermatozoöids as well. Zoöspores may be seen collected\r\nagainst the side of the vessel receiving direct sunlight, while the\r\nopposite side of the vessel will be free from them. The chlorophyll\r\nbodies of green cells arrange themselves similarly. The latter bodies\r\nmay move away from the exposed side of the cell if the light exceeds\r\na certain intensity.\r\n\r\nThe typical plant may not move its body toward or away from the\r\nsource of light, but it may secure the same end by dispositions of\r\nits surfaces to vary the angle at which the rays are received. This\r\nform of irritability is one of the most highly developed properties\r\nof the plant. Wiesner has found that a seedling of the vetch is\r\nsensitive to an amount of light represented by one ten-millionth of\r\na unit represented by a Roscoe-Bunsen flame. The \"sensitiveness\"\r\nto light may take one of three forms: The organ may place its axis\r\nparallel and pointing toward the source of the rays, as in stems,\r\nwhen it is said to be _proheliotropic_; the axis of the organ may\r\nassume a position perpendicular to the rays, which is designated as\r\n_diaheliotropism_; or it may place its axis parallel to the rays and\r\npointing away from the light, when it is said to be _apheliotropic_.\r\nUpright stems are proheliotropic, horizontal leaves and creeping\r\nstems are diaheliotropic, and roots and such stems as those of ivy\r\nare apheliotropic.\r\n\r\nSunlight varies from zero to the full blaze of the noonday sun,\r\nand assumes its greatest intensity in the equatorial regions. The\r\nintensity in latitudes 40° to 45° north would be represented by\r\n1.5 units, and at the equator by 1.6 units. Near the equator the\r\nintensity is so great that an ordinary leaf may not receive the full\r\nforce of the noonday sun without damage. The injury would not result\r\nfrom the luminous rays, but from the temperatures, 40° to 50° C.,\r\narising from the conversion of light into heat. As an adaptation to\r\nthis condition nearly all leaves have either a pendent or a vertical\r\nposition, or the power of assuming this position by motor or\r\nimpassive wilting movements.\r\n\r\nAmong the plants of the temperate zone the so-called compass plants\r\nare examples of similar adaptations. The compass plants include,\r\namong others, the wild lettuce (_Lactuca scariola_) and rosin weed\r\n(_Silphium laciniatum_). These plants place the leaves in a vertical\r\nposition with the tips pointing north and south in such manner that\r\nthe direct rays of the morning and evening sun only may strike the\r\nsurfaces at right angles, while the edges are presented to the\r\nfierce rays at noonday. That this arrangement is an adaptation\r\nagainst the intense light is evident when it is seen that specimens\r\ngrowing in shaded locations or in diffuse light place the leaves in\r\nthe typical horizontal position. To meet the functional conditions,\r\nboth sides of the compass leaves are almost equally provided with\r\npalisade cells for food formation and stomata for transpiration.\r\nThe estimation of the light striking a compass leaf shows that it\r\nreceives approximately the same amount of light as a horizontal leaf\r\nduring the course of a day, but the two maxima of intensity, morning\r\nand evening, are much below that of the noon of horizontal leaves.\r\n\r\nThe influence of light upon plants may be briefly summed as follows:\r\n\r\nLight is necessary for the formation of food substances by green\r\nplants, and it is an important factor in distribution in land and\r\nmarine forms.\r\n\r\nGrowth and reproduction are generally retarded by the action of the\r\nblue-violet rays.\r\n\r\nLight is fatal to certain bacteria and other low forms of vegetable\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMany plants have the power of accelerated growth of stems in\r\ndiminished light as an adaptation for lifting the leaves above\r\n\"shading\" objects.\r\n\r\nThe growth of many leaves and of the perianth of flowers is hindered\r\nin diminished light.\r\n\r\nThe outward form of many organs, particularly leaves, is dependent\r\nupon the intensity of the light received.\r\n\r\nThe internal structure of bilateral or dorsiventral organs is largely\r\ndetermined by the direction of the rays.\r\n\r\nPlants have the power of movement to adjust their surfaces to a\r\nproper angle with impinging light rays, as a protective adaptation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Matches which do not contain any phosphorus and which take fire by\r\n     friction on any surface--a match that has been long sought--have\r\n     been prepared by Mr. S. A. Rosenthal and Dr. S. J. von Kornocki.\r\n     It is represented that they can be manufactured as cheaply as\r\n     ordinary matches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STONE AGE IN EGYPT.\r\n\r\nBY J. DE MORGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the origin of man in Egypt is a very complex\r\nproblem, belonging as much to geology as to archæology. The earliest\r\nevidences we have of human industry, in fact, go back to so remote\r\na period that they should be regarded rather as fossils than as\r\narchæological documents. They are very coarsely worked flints, which\r\nare found near the surface of the ground among the pebbles of the\r\nQuaternary or Pleistocene epoch, and similar to those which occur\r\nabundantly in Europe, America, and Asia; but the study and collection\r\nof them have been pursued with less method than in those countries.\r\nThe more recent monuments, so much more conspicuous and more easily\r\naccessible, have attracted most attention, while these have been left\r\nin the background.\r\n\r\nNo region in the world presents a clearer and more distinct\r\nindividual character than Egypt. Each village is a special world,\r\neach valley a universe that has developed its own life; and man has\r\nfelt the special local impressions; and even in modern times, while\r\nall the Egyptian villages present a similar aspect, and although the\r\nfellah appears to be the same sort of a man everywhere, each locality\r\nhas its special individual characteristics. One who knows how to\r\nobserve men and things critically will find considerable differences.\r\nThese dissimilarities are as old as Egypt itself. They have always\r\nexisted, and are as much more intense as the communications between\r\ndistrict and district were formerly more difficult. They are due to\r\nphysical conditions special to each village, to the prevailing winds,\r\nthe form and character of the mountains, the extent of cultivable\r\nlands, and the supply of water. A study of the detail of the country\r\nis a very important preliminary to the examination of Egyptian\r\nhistory. Every village and every nome had formerly its special\r\ndivinity and its particular usages. Are we sure that the gods and\r\ncustoms were not imposed by local conditions? At Ombos two hostile\r\ngods were adored in the same temple. May we not see in this fact a\r\nrecollection of the hostility which has always prevailed between the\r\ninhabitants of the two banks of the river, and still continues?\r\n\r\nPrevious, however, to investigating these details which have been\r\nso influential on Egyptian civilization, we ought to dispel the\r\ndarkness which hides from us the earliest traces of man in the valley\r\nof the Nile, and examine how man lived in his beginning, to study\r\nthe geology of the country and its condition when it issued from the\r\nseas. As one of the results of this study we find that palæolithic\r\nman, known to us only through the rough-cut flints we find in the\r\nalluvions, made his first appearance. After this period of excavation\r\ncame that of filling up with silt, which still continues. New\r\nevidences of man appear in his burial places and the ruins of his\r\nvillages, the kitchen middens which he has left in his habitations\r\nof unburned brick and in his camps. This time he is more civilized;\r\nhe chips his flints with a skill that is not surpassed in European\r\nneolithic implements; he makes vessels of stone and clay, covers them\r\nwith rude paintings, sculptures animal forms of schist, and wears\r\nnecklaces of the shells and the stones of the country. Then comes a\r\nforeign people to take possession of Egypt, bringing knowledge of\r\nmetals, writing, hieroglyphics, painting, sculpture, new industries\r\nand arts that have nothing in common with the arts of the people it\r\nhas overcome. The ancient Pharaonic empire begins, or perhaps the\r\nreign of the divine dynasties. The men with stone implements are\r\nthe aborigines; the others are the conquering civilized Egyptians.\r\nNothing can be more interesting than a comparison of the arts of\r\nthe aborigines and those of the Egyptians of the earlier dynasties.\r\nNearly all their characteristics are different, and it is impossible\r\nto regard them as of common origin. Yet some of the native forms\r\npersisted till the last days of the empire of the Pharaohs. These\r\naborigines belonged to a race that is now extinct, they having been\r\nabsorbed into the mass of the Egyptians and Nubians among whom they\r\nlived, and from this mixture the fellah of ancient times is derived.\r\nThe origin of the conquering race--of the Egyptians as we know\r\nthem--has not been precisely determined. The weight of evidence, so\r\nfar as it has been obtained, and the balance of opinion, are in favor\r\nof an Asiatic origin and of primary relationship with the Shemites of\r\nChaldea.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt more than in any other country it is necessary to proceed\r\nwith the most scrupulous circumspection in the examination of remote\r\nantiquities. The relics of thousands of years of human life have been\r\npiled one upon another and often intermixed. The questions they raise\r\ncan not be answered in the cabinet or by the study of texts; but\r\nthe inquiry must be prosecuted on the ground, by comparison of the\r\ndeposits where they are found and in the deposits from which they are\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nFrom my first arrival in Egypt, in 1892, my attention has been\r\ngreatly occupied with the question of the origin of the relics of the\r\nstone age that have been found from time to time in that country. I\r\nhave gathered up the scattered documents, explored a large number of\r\nsites, and have bought such flint implements as I have found on sale.\r\nI have gradually been led to believe that while some of these cut\r\nstones may possibly belong to the historical epoch, we shall have\r\nto attribute a much more remote antiquity to the most of them, and\r\nthat evidences of a neolithic age in the valley of the Nile are more\r\nabundant than has generally been supposed.\r\n\r\nIn many minds the historical antiquity of Egypt, the almost fabulous\r\nages to which its civilization ascends, seem to challenge the\r\nhistory of other countries, and the land of the Pharaohs, rejecting\r\nall chronological comparison, to have appeared in the midst of the\r\nworld as a single example of a land which savage life had never\r\ntrodden. Yet what are the centuries since Menes ruled over the\r\nreclaimed valleys, the few thousand years of which we can calculate\r\nthe duration, by the side of the incalculable lapse of time since\r\nman, struggling with the glaciers and the prehistoric beasts,\r\nbegan his conquest of the earth? The antiquity of Egypt, the eight\r\nthousand years (if it be as many) since the first Pharaoh, are only\r\nas an atom in the presence of these ages. We can assert some vague\r\nknowledge of these pre-Pharaonic inhabitants, for two hatchets of\r\nthe Chellean pattern were found some time ago in the desert, one\r\nat Esnet, the other near the pyramids of Gizeh; and we can now\r\naffirm in the most positive manner that Quaternary man lived in the\r\ncountry which is now Egypt, and was then only preparing to be. Four\r\npalæolithic stations have been more recently discovered--at Thebes,\r\nTukh, Abydos, and Daschur. Join these sites to the other two where\r\nisolated pieces were found, and we have the geography of what we\r\nknow at present of Chellean man in the valley of the Nile. Doubtless\r\ncontinuous researches would result in similar discoveries at other\r\npoints, for I have met these relics wherever I have been able to make\r\na short sojourn. The Chellean implements are found in the gravels\r\nof the diluvium on the pebbly surface. They have been disturbed and\r\nprobably scattered, but some places yield them more numerously than\r\nothers--points possibly corresponding to the ancient workshops. I\r\nhave found a considerable number of specimens at Deir-el-Medinet;\r\nM. Daressy, of the Bureau of Antiquities, found a perfectly\r\ncharacteristic Chellean hammer stone in the Yalley of the Queens at\r\nGurneh, as perfectly worked as the best specimens found at Chelles,\r\nSt. Acheul, and Moulin-Quignon.\r\n\r\nThe finds are not very numerous at Tukh, but one may in a few hours\r\nmake a collection there of hatchets (or hammer stones), scrapers,\r\npoints, simple blades, and a large number of stones bearing\r\nindisputable marks of having been worked, but not presenting precise\r\nforms. The deposit at Abydos is in the bottom of a circle behind\r\nthe ruins surrounding the Pharaonic necropolis. The specimens seem\r\nsufficient to prove the existence of Quaternary man in Egypt, while\r\nthe search for them has hardly yet begun. In view of them it is\r\nextremely improbable that man did not also exist there during the\r\nlong period that intervened between this primitive age and that of\r\nthe earliest Egyptians who had metals. He did exist there then, and\r\nthe evidences of it are found in neolithic remains between Cairo\r\nand Thebes, a distance of about eight hundred kilometres along the\r\nvalley of the Nile, in the Fayum, and in Upper Egypt. Among these\r\nare the remarkable tombs at Abydos which have been explored by M. E.\r\nAmélineau, and of which he has published descriptions. They belong\r\nto a category which I have characterized as tombs of transition and\r\nas signalizing the passage from the use of polished stone to that of\r\nmetals. Their archaic character can not be disputed, and their royal\r\norigin is probably certain. They may belong to aboriginal kings or\r\nto the earliest dynasties. They reveal a knowledge of brass and of\r\nthe use of gold for ornament. At the necropolis of El-'Amrah, a few\r\nmiles south of Abydos, are some archaic tombs, all of the same model,\r\ncomposed of an oval trench from five to six and a half feet deep.\r\nThe body is laid on the left side, and the legs are doubled up till\r\nthe knees are even with the sternum; the forearms are drawn out in\r\nfront and the hands placed one upon the other before the face, while\r\nthe head is slightly bent forward. Around the skeleton are vases,\r\nand large, rudely made urns, often filled with ashes or the bones of\r\nanimals, and nearer to them are painted or red vessels with black\r\nor brown edges, vessels roughly shaped out of stone, and figurines\r\nin schist representing fishes or quadrupeds, cut flints, alabaster\r\nclubs, and necklaces and bracelets of shells. Bronze is rare, and\r\nfound always in shape of small implements. Both purely neolithic\r\ntombs and burials of the transition period to metals occur at\r\nEl-'Amrah. The most remarkable feature of the burials is the position\r\nof the corpse, totally unlike anything that is found of the Pharaonic\r\nages.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian finds of stone implements present the peculiarity as\r\ncompared with those of Europe, that types are found associated\r\ntogether belonging to what would be regarded in other countries\r\nas very different epochs. The time may come when subdivisions can\r\nbe made of the Egyptian stone age, but the study has not yet been\r\npursued far enough to make this practicable at present. Among these\r\narticles are hatchets showing the transitions, examples of which\r\nare wanting in Europe, from the rudest stone hammer to the polished\r\nneolithic implement; knives of various shape and some of handsome\r\nworkmanship; scrapers, lance heads, arrowheads, saws, pins, bodkins,\r\nmaces, beads, bracelets, and combs. The large number of instruments\r\nwith toothed blades found at some of the stations may be regarded\r\nas pointing to a very extensive cultivation of cereals at the time\r\nthey were in use. The deposits of Tukh, Zarraïdah, Khattarah,\r\nAbydos, etc., situated in regions suitable for growing grain, yield\r\nthousands of them, while they are very rare at the fishing station of\r\nDimeh. That the use of sickles tipped with flint very probably lasted\r\nlong after the introduction of metals seems to be proved by the\r\nhieroglyphics; but very few evidences of the existence of such tools\r\nare found after the middle empire.\r\n\r\nNo traces of articles related to the religion of the Pharaohs are\r\nfound in the burial places of the aborigines. In place of the\r\nstatuettes and funerary divinities of later times are found rude\r\nfigurines of animals cut in green schists. They represent fishes,\r\ntortoises with eyes adorned with hard stone or nacre, and numerous\r\nsigns the origin of which is unknown, and were apparently regarded\r\nas fetiches or divinities. Articles of pottery are very numerous,\r\nvery crude, and of a great variety of forms. It is not necessary to\r\nsuppose that the people who have left these relics were savages or\r\nbarbarians. History and even the present age afford instances of\r\nmany peoples who have obtained considerable degrees of civilization\r\nwhile backward in some of the arts. It is hardly possible to\r\nachieve delicacy of design and finish without the use of metals. I\r\nbelieve I have shown that an age of stone once existed in Egypt,\r\nand that it furthermore played an important part, even in Pharaonic\r\ncivilization.--_Translated for the Popular Science Monthly from the\r\nAuthor's Recherches sur les Origines de l'Egypte._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITION AND CRIME.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. E. P. EVANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January, 1898, an elderly woman came in great anxiety to a priest\r\nof the Church of St. Ursula, in Munich, Bavaria, and complained that\r\nthe devil haunted her house at night and frightened her by making\r\na great noise. In explanation of this unseasonable and undesirable\r\nvisit from the lower world she stated that a joint-stock company\r\nhad been formed in Berlin, with a branch in Munich, for the purpose\r\nof discovering hidden treasures, and that in order to attain this\r\nobject a human sacrifice must be made to the devil, and that she\r\nhad been selected as the victim. A woman, whose husband was a\r\nstockholder in the aforesaid company, had kindly communicated to her\r\nthis information, so that she might be prepared and have time to set\r\nher house in order. Satan, however, grew impatient of the promised\r\nsacrifice, and began to look after her. The priest sent one of his\r\nyounger assistants at the altar to read appropriate prayers in the\r\nhaunted house, and thus exorcise the evil spirit. We can hardly\r\nsuppose that his reverence believed in the reality of the reported\r\napparition, and yet he could not assert its impossibility by calling\r\nin question the existence of the devil or the actuality of diabolical\r\nagencies in human affairs without undermining the foundations of the\r\necclesiastical system, of which he was an acknowledged supporter.\r\nSuch a declaration would \"take away our hope,\" as the Scotchman said\r\nof the denial of a literal hell-fire and the doctrine of eternal\r\npunishment. It was for the same reason that the great body of the\r\nCatholic clergy, from Pope Leo XIII and the highest dignitaries\r\nof the church down to the humblest country vicar, so easily fell\r\ninto the snares laid by Leo Taxil and accepted the signature of the\r\ndevil Bitru as genuine, and his revelations concerning the pact of\r\nthe freemasons with Satan as authentic. It is certainly somewhat\r\nstartling to meet with such a case of gross superstition as the\r\nabove-mentioned in one of the seats of modern science and centers of\r\nEuropean civilization. In rural districts, remote from the influences\r\nof intellectual culture, however, instances of this kind are of quite\r\nfrequent occurrence, and often result in the commission of crime.\r\nHuman sacrifices to Satan are still by no means uncommon in many\r\nparts of Russia, and are supposed to be effective in warding off\r\nfamine and in staying the ravages of pestilence. Even in Germany and\r\nother countries of western Europe the belief in their prophylactic\r\nvirtue is remarkably prevalent, and would be often put into practice\r\nwere it not for the stricter administration of justice and the\r\ngreater terror of the law.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1889, the criminal court in the governmental province\r\nof Archangelsk, in northern Russia, sentenced a Samoyede, Jefrern\r\nPyrerka, to fifteen years' imprisonment with hard labor for the\r\nmurder of a maiden named Ssavaney. His sole defense was that an\r\nunusually severe winter with a heavy fall of snow had produced a\r\nfamine followed by scurvy, of which all his children had died. He\r\ntherefore made an image of the devil out of wood, smeared its lips\r\nwith fat, and set it up on a hillock. He then attempted to lasso\r\none of his companions, Andrey Tabarey, and had already thrown the\r\nnoose round his neck, when the energetic wife of the intended victim\r\nintervened and rescued her husband. Shortly afterward he succeeded\r\nin strangling the girl and offering her as a sacrifice to his idol.\r\nIn the province of Novgorod, known as \"the darkest Russia,\" it is a\r\ngeneral custom among the country people to sacrifice some animal,\r\nusually a black cat, a black cock, or a black dog, by burying it\r\nalive, in order to check the spread of cholera. In the village of\r\nKamenka, a peasant, whose son had died of this disease, interred\r\nwith the body eight live tomcats. The immolation of dumb animals,\r\nhowever, is deemed less efficacious than that of human beings. On\r\none occasion, when the cholera was raging severely, a deputation of\r\npeasants waited upon their parson, stating that they had determined\r\nto bury him alive in order to appease the demon of the plague. He\r\nescaped this horrible death only by apparently acceding to their\r\nwishes and craving a few days' respite in order to prepare for such a\r\nsolemn ceremony; meanwhile he took the measures necessary to secure\r\nhis safety and thwarted the purpose of his loving parishioners. In\r\nOkopovitchi, a village of the same province, the peasants succeeded\r\nin enticing an aged woman, Lucia Manjkov, into the cemetery, where\r\nthey thrust her alive into the grave containing the bodies of those\r\nwho had died of the epidemic, and quickly covered her up. When\r\nbrought to trial they proved that they had acted on the advice of\r\na military surgeon, Kosakovitch, who was therefore regarded as the\r\nchief culprit, and sentenced to be knouted by the hangman, and then\r\nto undergo twelve years' penal servitude in Siberia. We are indebted\r\nfor these instances of barbarous superstition to the researches of\r\nAugustus Löwenstimm, associate jurisconsult in the department of\r\njustice at St. Petersburg, who has derived them from thoroughly\r\nauthentic and mostly official sources. He reports several occurrences\r\nof a similar kind during the epidemics of cholera in 1831, 1855, and\r\n1872. Indeed, it is very difficult to abolish such pagan practices\r\nso long as the clergy foster the notion that animal sacrifices are\r\nexpiatory and propitiatory in their effects. In some parts of the\r\nprovince of Vologda it is still customary on the day dedicated to\r\nthe prophet Elias (July 20th in the Greek calendar) to offer up\r\nbullocks, he-goats, or other quadrupeds within the precincts of the\r\nchurch. The animal is driven into the courtyard surrounding the\r\nsacred edifice and there slaughtered; the flesh is boiled in a large\r\nkettle, one half of it being kept by the peasants who provide the\r\nsacrifice, while the other half is distributed among the priests and\r\nsacristans.[26]\r\n\r\nThe belief that the walls of dams, bridges, aqueducts, and buildings\r\nare rendered preternaturally strong by immuring a living human being\r\nwithin them still prevails in many countries of Christendom, and\r\nthere is hardly an old castle in Europe that has not a legend of this\r\nsort connected with it. Usually a child is supposed to be selected\r\nfor this purpose, and the roving bands of gypsies are popularly\r\naccused of furnishing the infant victims. The custom of depositing\r\ngold coins or other precious objects in the foundation stones of\r\nimportant public edifices is doubtless a survival of the ancient\r\nsuperstition.[27]\r\n\r\nLöwenstimm mentions a curious superstition of pagan origin still\r\npracticed in portions of Russia, and known as \"_korovya smertj_\"\r\n(cow-death) and \"_opachivaniye_\" (plowing roundabout). If pestilence\r\nor murrain prevails in a village, an old woman of repute as a seeress\r\nor fortune-teller enters the confines of the village at midnight and\r\nbeats a pan. Thereupon all the women of the place assemble in haste,\r\narmed with divers domestic utensils--frying-pans, pokers, tongs,\r\nshovels, scythes, and cudgels. After shutting the cattle in their\r\nstalls, and warning the men not to leave their houses, a procession\r\nis formed. The seeress takes off her dress and pronounces a curse\r\nupon Death. She is then hitched to a plow, together with a bevy of\r\nvirgins and a misshapen woman, if such a one can be found, and a\r\ncontinuous and closed furrow is drawn round the village three times.\r\nWhen the procession starts, the image of some saint suitable to the\r\noccasion, that of St. Blasius, for example, in the case of murrain,\r\nis borne in front of it; this is followed by the seeress, clad only\r\nin a shift, with disheveled hair and riding on a broomstick; after\r\nher come women and maidens drawing the plow, and behind them the rest\r\nof the crowd, shrieking and making a fearful din. They kill every\r\nanimal they meet, and if a man is so unfortunate as to fall in with\r\nthem he is mercilessly beaten, and usually put to death. In the eyes\r\nof these raging women he is not a human being, but Death himself\r\nin the form of a were-wolf, who seeks to cross their path and thus\r\nbreak the charm and destroy the healing virtue of the furrow. The\r\nceremony varies in different places, and generally ends by burying\r\nalive a cat, cock, or dog. In some districts the whole population of\r\nthe village, both men and women, take part in the procession, and\r\nare often attended by the clergy with sacred images and consecrated\r\nbanners. During the prevalence of the pest in the province of\r\nPodolia, in 1738, the inhabitants of the village of Gummenez, while\r\nmarching in procession through the fields, met Michael Matkovskij,\r\na nobleman of a neighboring village, who was looking for his stray\r\nhorses. The strange man, wandering about with an eager look and a\r\nbridle in his hand, was regarded as the incarnate pestilence, and\r\nwas therefore seized and most brutally beaten and left lying half\r\nnaked and half dead on the ground. At length he recovered his senses\r\nand succeeded with great difficulty in reaching his home. No sooner\r\nwas it known that he was still alive than the peasants rushed into\r\nhis house, dragged him to their village, subjected him to terrible\r\ntortures, and finally burned him. A curious feature of these remedial\r\nrites is the mixture of paganism and Christianity which characterizes\r\nthem; and it is an unquestionable though almost incredible fact that\r\ntheir atoning efficacy is often quite as firmly believed in by the\r\nvillage priests of the Russian Church as by the most ignorant members\r\nof their flock. In the autumn of 1894 some Russian peasants in the\r\ndistrict of Kazan slew one of their own number as a sacrifice to the\r\ngods of the Votiaks, a Finnish race dwelling on the Volga, Viatka,\r\nand Kama Rivers. Even orthodox Christians of the Greek Church,\r\nalthough regarding these gods as devils, fear and seek to propitiate\r\nthem, especially in times of public distress.\r\n\r\nStill more widely diffused is the practice of infanticide as the\r\nsequence of superstition. The belief that dwarfs or gnomes, dwelling\r\nin the inner parts of the earth, carry off beautiful newborn babes\r\nand leave their own deformed offspring in their stead is not confined\r\nto any one people, but is current alike in Germanic, Celtic, Romanic,\r\nand Slavic countries, and causes a misshapen child to be looked upon\r\nwith suspicion and subjected to cruel tortures and even killed. The\r\nsupposed changeling is often severely beaten with juniper rods and\r\nthe scourging attended with incantations, so as to compel the wicked\r\nfairies to reclaim their deformed bantling and restore the stolen\r\nchild. If the castigation proves ineffective, more summary measures\r\nare frequently taken, and the supposititious suckling is thrown out\r\nof the window on a dunghill or immersed in boiling water. In 1877, in\r\nthe city of New York, an Irish immigrant and his wife burned their\r\nchild to death under the delusion that they were ridding themselves\r\nof a changeling. Cases of this kind are quite common in Ireland,\r\nwhere the victims are sometimes adults.[28] Not long since Magoney,\r\nan Irish peasant, had a sickly child, which the most careful nurture\r\nfailed to restore to health and strength. The parents, therefore,\r\nbecame convinced that a changeling had been imposed upon them, and\r\nwhen the boy was four years old they resolved to have recourse to\r\nboiling water, in which he was kept, notwithstanding his shrieks and\r\nprotestations that he was not an elf, but their own Johnny Magoney,\r\nuntil death released him from his torments.\r\n\r\nWilhelm Mannhardt, the celebrated writer on folklore, states that\r\nwhen, in 1850, he was in Löblau, a village of West Prussia, he saw a\r\nman brutally maltreating a boy on the street. On inquiry he found\r\nthat the lad had done nothing worthy of blame, but that his only\r\nfault was an exceptionally large head. This cranial peculiarity,\r\noffensively conspicuous in what seems to have been a narrow-headed\r\nfamily, was reason enough for the parents to disown their offspring,\r\nand to treat him as the counterfeit of a child foisted in by the\r\nfairies. At Hadersleben, a considerable market town of North Silesia,\r\nthe wife of a farmer, in 1883, gave birth to a puny infant, which the\r\nparents at once assumed to be a changeling. In order to defeat the\r\nevil designs of the elves and to compel the restoration of their own\r\nchild, they held the newborn over a bed of live coals on the hearth\r\nuntil it was covered with blisters and died in intense agony. In East\r\nPrussia, the Mazurs, a Polish race, whose only notable contribution\r\nto modern civilization and the gayety of nations is the mazurka,\r\ntake precautionary measures by placing a book (usually the Bible,\r\nalthough any book will do) under the head of the newborn babe, so as\r\nto prevent the devil from spiriting it away and substituting for it\r\none of his own hellish brood, thus unwittingly furnishing a marvelous\r\nillustration of the beneficent influence of the printing press and\r\nthe magic power of literature. The Estonian inhabitants of the island\r\nof Oesel in Livonia refrain from kindling a fire in the house while\r\nthe rite of baptism is being celebrated, lest the light of the flames\r\nshould render it easier for Satan surreptitiously to exchange an imp\r\nfor the infant. After the sacred ceremony has been performed there is\r\nsupposed to be no danger of such a substitution.\r\n\r\nOne of the most incredible instances of this extremely silly and\r\nsurprisingly persistent superstition occurred in 1871 at Biskunizy,\r\na village of Prussian Posen, where a laborer, named Bekker, had by\r\nindustry and frugality gradually acquired a competence and been able\r\nto buy a house of his own, in which he led a happy domestic life\r\nwith his wife and five children, of whom he was very fond. After\r\nfourteen years of unbroken felicity the wife's elder sister, Marianne\r\nChernyak, came from Poland to pay them a visit. This woman was a\r\ncrackbrained devotee, who spent half her time in going to mass and\r\nthe other half in backbiting her neighbors. She also claimed that\r\nshe could detect at once whether a person is in league with Satan,\r\nand could cast out devils. The villagers came to look upon her as\r\na witch, and avoided all association with her, especially as her\r\naberrations manifested themselves in exceedingly malevolent and\r\nmischievous forms. Unfortunately, she acquired complete ascendency\r\nover her younger sister, who accepted her absurd pretensions as real.\r\nOn November 19, 1871, Marianne, after returning from confession, went\r\nto bed, but at midnight Mrs. Bekker, who slept with her youngest\r\nchild, a boy about a year old, was awakened by a fearful shriek and\r\nlit the lamp. Thereupon the sister rushed into the room, crying:\r\n\"The demons have stolen your child and put a changeling in your bed:\r\nbeat him, beat him, if you wish to have your child again!\" Under the\r\ninfluence of this suggestion, which seemed to be almost hypnotic in\r\nits character, the bewildered mother began to beat the boy. The aunt\r\nnow seized him and swung him to and fro, as if she would fling him\r\nout of the window, at the same time calling out to Satan: \"There!\r\nyou have him; take your brat!\" She then gave him back to his mother\r\nwith the words: \"Throw him to the ground, drub him, beat him to\r\ndeath; otherwise you will never recover your child.\" This advice was\r\nfollowed, and the boy severely strapped with a heavy girdle as he\r\nlay on the floor. Meanwhile Bekker, hearing the noise, got up and\r\nat first tried to intervene for the protection of his son, but was\r\neasily convinced by his wife that she was doing the right thing,\r\nand persuaded to aid her in discomfiting the devil by beating the\r\nboy with a juniper stick. The process of exorcism, thus renewed\r\nwith increased vigor, soon proved fatal. At this juncture, as the\r\nson of the aunt, a lad of five years, threw himself down with loud\r\nlamentations beside the dead body of his little cousin, his mother\r\ncried out: \"Beat him; he is not my child! Why should we spare him?\r\nWe shall get other children!\" Thereupon he, too, was maltreated in\r\nthe same manner until he expired. The aunt then declared that the\r\ndevil had crept into the stovepipe, and went to work to demolish\r\nthe stove, but, when she was prevented from doing so, fled into the\r\ngarden, where she was found the next morning by the school-teacher.\r\nBy this time Bekker and his wife seem to have come to their senses,\r\nand were sitting by the corpses of the murdered children, weeping\r\nand praying, as the neighbors entered the house. The trial, which\r\ntook place at Ostrov in January, 1872, led to the introduction of\r\nconflicting expert testimony concerning the mental soundness of the\r\naccused, and the matter was finally referred to a commission of\r\npsychiaters in Berlin, who decided that Bekker and his wife were not\r\nsuffering from mental disease, and therefore not irresponsible, but\r\nthat the aunt was subject to periodical insanity to such a degree as\r\nnot to be accountable for her actions. Curiously enough, the jurors\r\nremained uninfluenced by this testimony, and pronounced her guilty\r\nof the crime laid to her charge, and in accordance with this verdict\r\nthe court sentenced her to three years' imprisonment with hard labor.\r\nThe jurors even went so far as to declare that she herself did not\r\nbelieve in the existence of elf children or satanic changelings, but\r\nmade use of this popular superstition for her own selfish purposes,\r\nand that she guilefully denounced her own boy as an imp in order to\r\nget rid of him. In this verdict, or rather in the considerations\r\nurged in support of it, it is easy to perceive the effects of strong\r\nlocal prejudice against the accused, who had the reputation of being\r\na lazy, malicious, and crafty person, and was therefore denied the\r\nextenuation of honest self-deception. Indeed, in such cases it is\r\nalways more or less difficult to determine where sincere delusion\r\nceases and conscious swindling begins. Just at this point the annals\r\nof superstition present many puzzling problems, the solution of which\r\nis of special interest as well as of great practical importance\r\nnot only to the psychologist and psychiater, but also to the\r\nlegislator and jurisprudent, who have to do with the enactment and\r\nadministration of criminal laws.\r\n\r\nIn the penal codes of the most civilized nations the agency of\r\nsuperstition as a factor in the promotion of crime is almost wholly\r\nignored, and, as this was not the case in former times, the omission\r\nwould seem to assume that the general diffusion of knowledge in\r\nour enlightened age had rendered all such specifications obsolete\r\nand superfluous. Only in the Russian penal code, especially in the\r\nsections _Ulosheniye_ and _Ustav_ on felonies and frauds, as cited\r\nby Löwenstimm, do we find a distinct recognition and designation\r\nof various forms of superstition as incentives to crime. Thus,\r\nin paragraph 1469 of the first of these sections, the murder of\r\n\"monstrous births or misshapen sucklings\" as changelings is expressly\r\nmentioned, and the penalty prescribed; and in other clauses of the\r\ncode punishments are imposed for the desecration of graves and\r\nmutilation of corpses, in order to procure talismans or to prevent\r\nthe dead from revisiting the earth as vampires, and for various\r\noffenses emanating from the belief in sorcery and diabolical\r\npossession. The practice of opening graves and mutilating dead\r\nbodies is quite common, and arises in general from the notion that\r\npersons who die impenitent and without extreme unction, including\r\nsuicides and victims to delirium tremens, apoplexy, and other forms\r\nof sudden death, as well as schismatics, sorcerers, and witches,\r\ncome forth from their graves and wander about as vampires, sucking\r\nthe blood of individuals during sleep and inflicting misery upon\r\nentire communities by producing drought, famine, and pestilence. The\r\nmeans employed to prevent this dangerous metamorphosis, or at least\r\nto compel the vampire to remain in the grave, differ in different\r\ncountries. In Russia the deceased is buried with his face downward,\r\nand an ashen stake driven through his back, while in Poland and East\r\nPrussia the corpse is wrapped up in a fish net and covered with\r\npoppies, owing, doubtless, to the soporific qualities of this plant.\r\nPreventive measures of this kind are often taken with the consent and\r\nco-operation of the clergy and local authorities. Thus, in 1849, at\r\nMariensee, near Dantzig, in West Prussia, a peasant's wife came to\r\nthe Catholic priest of the parish and complained that an old woman\r\nnamed Welm, recently deceased, appeared in her house and beat and\r\notherwise tormented her child. The priest seems to have accepted\r\nthe truth of her statement, since he ordered the corpse to be\r\ndisinterred, decapitated, reburied at a cross-road, and covered with\r\npoppies. In 1851, during the prevalence of cholera in Ukraine, in the\r\ngovernmental province of Kiev, the peasants of Possady attributed\r\nthe epidemic to a deceased sacristan and his wife, who were supposed\r\nto roam about at night as vampires and kill people by sucking their\r\nblood. In order to stay the ravages of the scourge the corpses of\r\nthis couple were exhumed, their heads cut off and burned, and ashen\r\nstakes driven through their backs into the ground. In 1892 a peasant\r\nwoman in the Russian province of Kovno hanged herself in a wood near\r\nthe village of Somenishki. The priest refused her Christian burial\r\nbecause she had committed suicide, and was therefore given over to\r\nthe devil. In order that she might rest quietly in her grave and\r\nnot be changed into a vampire, her sons severed her head from her\r\nbody and laid it at her feet. In thus refusing to perform religious\r\nfuneral rites the priest obeyed the canons of the church and also\r\nthe laws of the Russian Empire. Until quite recently a corner of\r\nunconsecrated ground next to the wall of the Russian cemetery was\r\nreserved as a sort of carrion pit for the corpses of self-murderers,\r\nand it is expressly prescribed in the _Svod Sakonov_[29] that they\r\n\"shall be dragged to such place of infamy by the knacker, and\r\nthere covered with earth.\" This treatment of a _felo-de-se_ by\r\nthe ecclesiastical and civil authorities directly fosters popular\r\nsuperstition by tending to confirm the notion that there is something\r\nuncanny, eldritch, demoniacal, and preternaturally malignant inherent\r\nin his mortal remains, a notion still further strengthened by a most\r\nunjust paragraph (1472) in the Russian code, which declares the last\r\nwill and testament of a suicide to have no legal validity. Drought,\r\ntoo, as well as pestilence, is ascribed to the evil agency of\r\nvampires, which \"milk the clouds,\" and hinder the falling of the dew.\r\nIn 1887 the South Russian province of Cherson began to suffer from\r\ndrought soon after a peasant had hanged himself in the village of\r\nIvanovka, the inhabitants of which, assuming a causative connection\r\nbetween the aridity and the self-homicide, poured water on the grave\r\nwhile uttering the following words: \"I sprinkle, I pour; may God send\r\na shower, bring on a little rainfall, and relieve us from misery!\" As\r\nthis invocation failed to produce the desired effect, the body was\r\ntaken up and inhumed again in a gorge outside of the village. In some\r\ndistricts the corpse is disinterred, beaten on the head, and drenched\r\nwith water poured through a sieve; in others it is burned.\r\n\r\nThe records of the criminal courts in West Prussia during the last\r\nhalf century contain numerous instances of the violation of graves\r\nfrom superstitious motives. Thus in March, 1896, a peasant died in\r\nthe village of Penkuhl; soon afterward his son was taken ill of a\r\nlingering disease, which the remedies prescribed by the country\r\ndoctor failed to relieve. It did not take long for the \"wise women\"\r\nof the village to convince him that his father was a \"nine-killer,\"\r\nand would soon draw after him into the grave nine of his next of\r\nkin. The sole means of depriving him of this fatal power would be to\r\ndisinter him and sever his head from his body. In accordance with\r\nthis advice the young man dug up the corpse by night and decapitated\r\nit with a spade. In this case the accused, if tried in court, might\r\nhonestly declare that he acted in self-defense; indeed, he might\r\nplead in justification of his conduct that he thereby preserved\r\nnot only his own life, but also the lives of eight of his nearest\r\nand dearest relations, and that he should be commended rather than\r\ncondemned for what he had done. It is the possibility and sincerity\r\nof this plea that render it so difficult to deal with such offenses\r\njudicially and justly. Here is needed what Tennyson calls\r\n\r\n    \"The intuitive decision of a bright\r\n    And thorough-edged intellect, to part\r\n    Error from crime.\"\r\n\r\nQuite different, however, from a moral point of view, is the opening\r\nof graves in quest of medicaments, and especially of talismans, which\r\nare supposed to bring good luck to the possessor or to enable him\r\nto practice sorcery and to commit crime with impunity. In ancient\r\ntimes, and even in the middle ages, physicians sometimes prescribed\r\nparts of the human body as medicine, and in Franconia, North Bavaria,\r\na peasant now occasionally enters an apothecary's shop and asks for\r\n\"_Armensünderfett_,\" poor sinner's fat, obtained from the bodies of\r\nexecuted malefactors and prized as a powerful specific. The culprit\r\nwas tried first for murder and then for lard, and thus made doubly\r\nconducive to the safety and sanitation of the community. Formerly\r\nmany persons went diligently to public executions for the purpose\r\nof procuring a piece of the criminal as a healing salve, but since\r\nthe hangman or headsman has generally ceased to perform his fearful\r\nfunctions in the presence of a promiscuous crowd, such loathsome\r\nremedies for disease are sought in churchyards.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1865, a Polish peasant in Wyssokopiz, near Warsaw, discovered\r\nthat the grave of his recently deceased wife had been opened and\r\nthe corpse mutilated. Information was given to the police, and a\r\nshepherd's pipe, found in the churchyard, led to the detection of\r\nthe culprit in the person of the communal shepherd, a man twenty-six\r\nyears old, who on examination confessed that he, with the aid of two\r\naccomplices, had committed the disgustful deed. His object, he said,\r\nwas to procure a tooth and the liver of a dead person. He intended\r\nto pulverize the tooth and after mixing it with snuff to give it to\r\nhis brother-in-law in order to poison him. On perceiving, however,\r\nthat the body was that of a woman, he did not take the tooth, because\r\nit would have no power to kill a man; but he cut out the liver for\r\nthe purpose of burying it in a field where the sheep were pastured,\r\nand thus causing the death of the entire flock in case he should be\r\nsuperseded by another shepherd, which he feared might happen. All\r\nthree were condemned to hard labor in Siberia.\r\n\r\nIt is a quite prevalent notion that if any part of a corpse is\r\nconcealed in a house, the inmates will have the corresponding bodily\r\norgans affected by disease and gradually paralyzed. A drastic\r\nexample of this superstition occurred in May, 1875, at Schwetz,\r\na provincial town of West Prussia, where a woman named Albertine\r\nMayevski became the mother of a male child, which died soon after\r\nits birth. The father, to whom she was betrothed, refused to marry\r\nher, and to punish him for this breach of promise she disinterred\r\nthe body of her babe, cut off its right hand at the wrist and the\r\ngenitals, and hid them in the chimney of the house of her faithless\r\nlover, hoping thereby to cause the hand, with which he had pledged\r\nhis vow, to wither away, and to render him impotent. All this she\r\nfreely confessed when brought to trial, and was sentenced to two\r\nmonths' imprisonment. But such relics of the tomb are used, on the\r\nprinciple of _similia similibus_, not only for inflicting injury, but\r\nalso for bringing luck. Thus members of the \"light-fingered craft\"\r\ncarry with them the finger of a corpse in order to enhance their\r\nskill, success, and safety in thievery; if the finger belonged to an\r\nadroit thief or a condemned criminal its talismanic virtue is all the\r\ngreater. It is also believed that a purse in which a finger joint is\r\nkept will contain an inexhaustible supply of money. The finger of a\r\nmurdered man is greatly prized by burglars because it is supposed\r\nto possess a magic power in opening locks. The records of criminal\r\ncourts prove that these absurd notions are generally entertained by\r\ncommon malefactors in East Prussia, Thuringia, Silesia, Bohemia,\r\nand Poland. A candle made of fat obtained from the human body is\r\nvery frequently used by thieves on account of its supposed soporific\r\npower, since with such a taper, known in Germany as _Diebslicht_\r\nor _Schlummerlicht_ (sloom-light in provincial English), they are\r\nconfident of being able to throw all the inmates of the house\r\ninto a deep sleep, and thus rummage the rooms at will and with\r\nperfect impunity. The danger of detection is also forestalled by\r\nlaying a dead man's hand on a window sill; and in order to make\r\nassurance doubly sure, both preservatives are usually employed.\r\nHence the proverbial saying, \"He sleeps as though a dead hand had\r\nbeen carried round him.\" The desire to procure material for such\r\ncandles often leads to the commission of crime. An Austrian jurist,\r\nDr. Gross, in his manual for inquisitorial judges (_Handbuch für\r\nUntersuchungsrichter_), and the folklorists Mannhardt and Jakushkin,\r\ngive numerous instances of this kind, and there is no doubt that\r\nthe many mysterious murders and ghastly mutilations, especially of\r\nwomen and children, so horrifying to the public and puzzling to the\r\npolice, are due to the same cause. In most cases the prosecuting\r\nattorneys and judges are unable to discover the real motives of such\r\nbloody and brutal deeds because they are ignorant of the popular\r\nsuperstitions in which they have their origin, and, for lack of any\r\nbetter explanation, attribute them to mere brutishness, wantonness,\r\nhomicidal mania, and other vague and unintelligible impulses, whereas\r\nin reality they spring from a supremely selfish but exceedingly\r\ndefinite purpose, are perpetrated deliberately, and with the normal\r\nexercise of the mental faculties, and can not be mitigated even by\r\nthe extenuating plea of sudden passion. Crimes of this sort are\r\nof common occurrence not only in the semi-barbarous provinces of\r\nRussia, but also in Austria and Germany, justly reckoned among the\r\nmost civilized countries of Christendom. On January 1, 1865, the\r\nhouse of a man named Peck, near Elbing in West Prussia, was entered\r\nduring the absence of the family by a burglar, Gottfried Dallian,\r\nwho killed the maid-servant, Catharina Zernickel, and ransacked\r\nthe premises in search of money and other objects of value. Before\r\ncarrying off his spoils he cut a large piece of flesh out of the body\r\nof the murdered girl in order to make candles for his protection on\r\nfuture occasions of this sort. The talismanic light, which he kept\r\nin a tin tube, did not prevent him from being caught in the act of\r\ncommitting another burglary about six weeks later. During the trial,\r\nwhich resulted in his condemnation to death, he confessed that he\r\nhad eaten some of the maid-servant's flesh in order to appease his\r\nconscience. This disgusting method of alleviating the \"compunctious\r\nvisitings of Nature\" would seem to confirm the suggestion of a\r\nwriter in the _Russkiya Wjedomosti_ (Russian News, 1888, No. 359)\r\nthat the thieves' candle is a survival of primitive cannibalism,\r\ndistinct traces of which he also discovers in a Russian folk song\r\nwhich runs as follows: \"I bake a cake out of the hands and feet, out\r\nof the silly head I form a goblet, out of the eyes I cast drinking\r\nglasses, out of the blood I brew an intoxicating beer, and out of\r\nthe fat I mold a candle.\" It is certainly very queer to find such\r\nstuff constituting the theme of popular song within the confines\r\nof Christian civilization at the present day, a grewsome stuff more\r\nsuitable as the staple of Othello's tales\r\n\r\n    \"--of the cannibals that each other eat,\r\n    The anthropophagi, and men whose heads\r\n    Do grow beneath their shoulders.\"\r\n\r\nIn the burglary just mentioned the murder and mutilation of the\r\nmaid were incidental to the robbery, and probably an afterthought,\r\nbut there are on record numerous instances of persons being waylaid\r\nand killed for the sole purpose of making candles out of their\r\nadipose tissue. No longer ago than November 15, 1896, two peasants\r\nwere convicted of this crime in Korotoyak, a city on the Don in\r\nSouth Russia. Their victim was a boy twelve years of age, whom they\r\nstrangled and eviscerated in order to make candles from the fat of\r\nthe caul and entrails. It would be superfluous and tedious to cite\r\nadditional examples of this outrageous offense against humanity and\r\ncommon sense, for, like the devils that entered into the Gadarene\r\nswine, their name is Legion.\r\n\r\nA still more disgusting and dangerous superstition is the notion that\r\nsupernatural powers are acquired by eating the heart of an unborn\r\nbabe of the male sex, just as a savage imagines that by eating the\r\nheart of a brave foe he can become indued with his valor. The modern\r\nEuropean cannibal believes that by eating nine hearts, or parts of\r\nthem, he can make himself invisible and even fly through the air.\r\nHe can thus commit crime without detection, and defy all efforts to\r\narrest or imprison him, releasing himself with ease from fetters, and\r\npassing through stone walls. This horrible practice has been known\r\nfor ages, and is still by no means uncommon. In the first half of the\r\nfifteenth century the notorious marshal of France, Gilles de Laval,\r\nBaron of Rayz, is said to have murdered in his castle near Nantes one\r\nhundred and fifty women in order to get possession of unborn babes.\r\nHe was then supposed to have committed these atrocities from lewd\r\nmotives, and was also accused of worshiping Satan. A mixed commission\r\nof civilians and ecclesiastics, appointed to examine into the matter,\r\nfound him guilty and condemned him to be strangled and burned on\r\nOctober 25, 1440. In 1429, when he was thirty-three years of age, he\r\nhad fought the English at Orleans by the side of Joan of Arc, and it\r\nwas probably the desire to acquire supernatural powers in emulation\r\nof the maid that led him to perpetrate a succession of inhuman\r\nbutcheries extending over a period of fourteen years, the real object\r\nof which seems to have been imperfectly understood by the tribunal\r\nwhich sentenced him to death.[30] Löwenstimm cites several instances\r\nof this crime. Thus, in 1577 a man was put to the rack in Bamberg,\r\nNorth Bavaria, for murdering and disemboweling three pregnant women.\r\nIn the seventeenth century a band of robbers, whose chief was known\r\nas \"King Daniel,\" created intense consternation among the inhabitants\r\nof Ermeland in East Prussia. For a long time these freebooters roved\r\nand spoiled with impunity, but were finally arrested and executed.\r\nThey confessed that they had killed fourteen women, but, as the\r\nunborn infants proved to be female, their hearts were devoid of\r\ntalismanic virtue. Indeed, they attributed their capture to this\r\nunfortunate and unforseeable circumstance, and posed as persons\r\nworthy of commiseration on account of their ill luck. One of the\r\nstrangest features of this cruel and incredible superstition is its\r\npersistency in an age of superior enlightenment. Dr. Gross records\r\ntwo cases of comparatively recent occurrence in the very centers of\r\nmodern civilization: one in 1879, near Hamburg, where a woman, great\r\nwith child, was killed and cut open by a Swede named Andersen, and\r\nanother of like character ten years later in Simmering, near Vienna.\r\n\r\nAn ordeal very commonly practiced in the middle ages to determine\r\nthe guilt or innocence of any one accused of theft was to give him\r\na piece of consecrated cheese, which, if he were guilty, it would\r\nbe impossible for him to swallow. Hence arose the popular phrase,\r\n\"It sticks in his throat.\" Thus Macbeth says, after he had \"done the\r\ndeed\":\r\n\r\n    \"But wherefore could not I pronounce amen?\r\n    I had most need of blessing, and amen\r\n    Stuck in my throat.\"\r\n\r\nWuttke states that this custom still prevails in the Prussian\r\nprovince of Brandenburg, where a person suspected of larceny is\r\nmade to swallow a piece of Dutch cheese on which certain magical\r\nletters and signs are scratched. His failure to do so is regarded\r\nas conclusive evidence of his guilt. Various other means of making\r\ninquest for the detection of crime are in vogue, some of them merely\r\nsilly, and others mercilessly savage. Thus a mirror is laid for\r\nthree successive nights in the grave of a dead man. It is placed\r\nthere in the name of God, and taken out in the name of Satan. It\r\nis believed that by looking into such a mirror the person of the\r\nthief can be clearly seen. A bull belonging to a peasant not far\r\nfrom Perm, on the Kama, died suddenly. The owner declared that the\r\ndeath of the animal was due to witchcraft, and demanded that all\r\nthe women of the village should be made to creep through a horse\r\ncollar in order to discover the hag who had wrought the mischief.\r\nThis plan was approved by his neighbors, and, although their wives\r\nprotested against being subjected to the degrading and for corpulent\r\nwomen extremely difficult and even dangerous test, they finally\r\nsubmitted to it rather than remain under the suspicion of practicing\r\nthe black art. This performance, which is unquestionably a relic of\r\nUralian-Finnish paganism, took place on March 16, 1896. The following\r\ninstance may serve as an example of the ruthless barbarity to which\r\nsuch delusions often lead: In December, 1874, a South Russian peasant\r\nin the vicinity of Cherson missed one hundred rubles and went to a\r\nweird woman in order to learn what had become of them. She consulted\r\nher cards and declared that the money had been stolen by a certain\r\nMarfa Artynov. The man was greatly astonished at this response,\r\nbecause the accused was a highly respected teacher of young children,\r\nand had the reputation of being thoroughly honest. Nevertheless, his\r\ncredulity got the better of his common sense, and with the aid of his\r\nneighbors he seized Marfa and carried her to the churchyard, where\r\nhe bound her to a cross and began to torture her, beating her with a\r\nknout, suspending her by her hands, and twisting and tearing her neck\r\nand tongue with a pincers. To her cries and entreaties her tormentors\r\ncoolly replied, \"If you are really innocent, what we are doing can\r\ncause you no pain!\" Many of the persons who offer their services\r\nas clairvoyants and seers to a credulous and confiding public, and\r\nwhose utterances are accepted as oracles, are professional swindlers.\r\nThus a young lady moving in the higher circles of society in Vienna\r\nhad a valuable set of diamonds stolen. By the advice of a trusted\r\nlackey she consulted a woman, who was reputed to have the power of\r\ndivination, and who informed her, contrary to the strong suspicions\r\nof the police, that the theft had been committed, not by any member\r\nof the household, but by a stranger. The young lady was so firmly\r\npersuaded of the truth of this statement that, although urged by the\r\ncourt to prosecute the lackey, she refused to do so. The evidence\r\nagainst him, however, was so strong that he was finally tried and\r\ncondemned. The pythoness, who had endeavored to exculpate him, proved\r\nto be his aunt and accomplice.\r\n\r\nA queer phase of superstition, which in many parts of Europe\r\nseriously interferes with the administration of justice, manifests\r\nitself in the various means of avoiding the evil consequences of\r\nperjury, at least so far as to soothe the pangs of conscience and to\r\navert the divine anger. This immunity is secured in some provinces\r\nof Austria by carrying on one's person a bit of consecrated wafer, a\r\npiece of bone from the skeleton of a child, or the eyes of a hoopoe,\r\nholding a ducat or seven small pebbles in the mouth, pressing the\r\nleft hand firmly against the side, crooking the second finger, or\r\npulling off a button from the trousers while in the act of swearing,\r\nor spitting immediately after taking an oath. The Russian province\r\nof Viatka is settled by a people of Finnish origin, the majority\r\nof whom have been baptized and call themselves orthodox Christians,\r\nwhile the remainder are still nominally as well as really heathen.\r\nWhen they take an oath it is administered by a pope or priest, and a\r\nRussian jurist, J. W. Mjeshtshaninov, describes the method employed\r\nby them to forswear themselves with safety. When called upon to\r\ntake an oath, the witness raises the right hand with the index\r\nfinger extended; he then lays the left hand in the palm of the right\r\nhand with the index finger pointing downward, and by a crisscross\r\ncombination of the other fingers, which probably works as a charm,\r\nthe whole body is converted into a conductor, so that the oath\r\nentering through the index finger of the right hand passes through\r\nthe index finger of the left hand into the earth like an electric\r\ncurrent. The witness thus feels himself discharged of the binding\r\ninfluence of the oath, and may give false testimony without laying\r\nperjury upon his soul.\r\n\r\nThe superstitions which encourage ignorant people to commit crime are\r\nhanded down from generation to generation, and have in most cases\r\na purely local character. In other words, the charms and sorceries\r\nand other magical arts employed to produce the same results differ\r\nin different places, and unless the judges are familiar with these\r\nvarious forms of superstition they will be unable to understand the\r\nexact nature of the offenses with which they have to deal, and their\r\nefforts to detect and punish violations of the law will be greatly\r\nhampered and sometimes completely thwarted.\r\n\r\nThe subject here discussed has not only a speculative interest\r\nfor ethnographers and students of folklore, but also, as already\r\nindicated, a practical importance for criminal lawyers and courts\r\nof justice in the Old World and even in the United States. The tide\r\nof immigration that has recently set in from the east and south\r\nof Europe has brought to our shores an immense number of persons\r\nstrongly infected with the delusions which we have attempted to\r\ndescribe. Acts which would seem at first sight to have their\r\norigin in impulses of cruelty and brutality are found on closer\r\ninvestigation to be due to crass ignorance and credulity, and,\r\nalthough the ultimate motives are usually utterly selfish, there are\r\nrare instances in which the perpetrators of such deeds are thoroughly\r\ndisinterested and altruistic, and do the most revolting things, not\r\nfrom greed of gain, but solely for the public good. In cases of this\r\nkind the most effective preventive of wrongdoing is not judicial\r\npunishment but intellectual enlightenment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] Löwenstimm's studies, printed originally in the Journal of the\r\nMinistry of Justice in St. Petersburg, have been made accessible to a\r\nlarger class of readers by being collected and translated into German\r\nin a volume entitled Aberglaube und Strafrecht (Berlin: Räde, 1897),\r\nwith an introduction by Prof. Joseph Kohler, of the University of\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\n[27] As the Siberian Railway approached the northern boundaries of\r\nthe Chinese Empire and surveys were made for its extension through\r\nManchuria to the sea, great excitement was produced in Pekin by the\r\nrumor that the Russian minister had applied to the Empress of China\r\nfor two thousand children to be buried in the roadbed under the rails\r\nin order to strengthen it. Some years ago, in rebuilding a large\r\nbridge, which had been swept away several times by inundations in the\r\nYarkand, eight children, purchased from poor people at a high price,\r\nwere immured alive in the foundations. As the new bridge was firmly\r\nconstructed out of excellent materials, it has hitherto withstood the\r\nforce of the strongest floods, a result which the Chinese attribute,\r\nnot to the solid masonry, but to the propitiation of the river god by\r\nan offering of infants.\r\n\r\n[28] See the case of Bridget Cleary, reported in Appletons' Popular\r\nScience Monthly for November, 1895, p. 86.

A. UDDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA western naturalist once said that the geology of Kansas was\r\nmonotonous. In one sense this remark is certainly justifiable,\r\nand the same may be said about the geology of some of the other\r\nStates on the Western plains. The American continent is built on\r\na comprehensive plan, and many of its formations can be followed\r\nfor hundreds of miles without presenting much variation in general\r\nappearance. Occasionally, however, some feature of special interest\r\ncrops out from the serene uniformity, and the very nature of its\r\nsurroundings then makes it appear all the more striking. Minor\r\naccidents in the development of our extensive terranes sometimes\r\nstand out in bold relief, as it were, from the monotonous background.\r\nIn their isolation from other details such features occasionally\r\ndisplay past events with unusual clearness.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case with a deposit of volcanic ash which has been\r\ndiscovered in the superficial strata on the plains.[31] It lies\r\nscattered in great quantities in a number of localities in Nebraska,\r\nKansas, South Dakota, and Colorado, having been found in no less than\r\ntwenty counties in the first-mentioned State. It measures from two\r\nto fourteen feet in thickness in different localities, and is mostly\r\nfound imbedded in yellow marl and clay, and has a somewhat striking\r\nappearance in the field, due to its snowy whiteness and to the\r\nsharpness of the plane which separates it from the underlying darker\r\nmaterials. Many years before its real nature was known it had been\r\nnoticed and described by Western geologists. Prof. O. T. St. John saw\r\nit many years ago in Kansas, where it appeared as \"an exceedingly\r\nfine, pure white siliceous material,\" forming a separate layer of\r\nseveral feet, and set off by a sharp line from the buff clay-marl\r\nbelow. His words describe its usual appearance in other places (see\r\nFig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--STRATIFIED VOLCANIC ASH NEAR MEADE, KANSAS.\r\n\r\n(From the University Geological Survey of Kansas, vol. ii.)]\r\n\r\nThis ash occurs in several outcrops in McPherson County in the\r\ncentral part of Kansas, where the writer had an opportunity to study\r\nit somewhat in detail a few years ago. Some of the features of the\r\ndust at this place reveal the conditions under which it was formed\r\nwith considerable distinctness, and the volcanic episode which\r\nproduced it appears strikingly different from the dull monotony of\r\nthe ordinary geological work recorded in the terranes of the plains.\r\nIt may be said to consist of angular flakes of pumice, averaging one\r\nsixteenth of a millimetre in diameter, and having a thickness of\r\nabout one three-hundredth of a millimetre. The most common shape of\r\nthe flakes is that of a triangle, or rather of a spherical triangle,\r\nsince the flakes are apt to be concave on one side and convex on the\r\nother. In the microscope they sometimes appear like splinters of tiny\r\nbubbles of glass, and this is really what they are (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--FLAKES OF VOLCANIC ASH. Magnified about 100\r\ndiameters. A, flake with a branching rib; B, fragment of a broken\r\nhollow sphere of glass; C, fragment with drawn-out tubular vesicles;\r\nD and E, plain fragments of broken pumice bubbles. (From American\r\nGeologist, April, 1893.)]\r\n\r\nThe explosive eruptions which give rise to showers of this kind of\r\nash, or dust, are due to fusion and superheating of subterranean\r\nmasses of rocks charged with more or less moisture. A part of this\r\nmoisture escapes in the form of steam at the time of an eruption.\r\nBut the viscidity of the ejected material prevents much of the steam\r\nfrom passing off, and such of the lava as cools most rapidly retains\r\na certain quantity in solution, as it were. Obsidian is a rock which\r\nhas been made in this way. It often contains much of the original\r\nwater, which will cause it to swell up into a stony froth when fused.\r\n\r\nThis volcanic dust has the same property. If one small particle of\r\nit be heated on a piece of platinum foil it is seen to swell up\r\ninto a compound bubble of glass (Fig. 3). It is evident that this\r\nis due to the expansive force of the heated included moisture, to\r\nwhich the viscid half-molten glass readily yields. At the time of\r\nthe eruption which produced this dust, subterranean heat was applied\r\nto the moisture-bearing rock until this was superheated to such an\r\nextent that the weight of the overlying material was insufficient to\r\nhold the water from expanding into steam. Then there was a tremendous\r\nexplosion, and the molten magma was thrown up with such a force that\r\nit was shattered into minute droplets, in the same way as water does\r\nwhen it is thrown forcibly into the air. Being thus released from\r\npressure, the steam inside of each little particle of the heated\r\nglass caused it to swell out into a tiny bubble. As this kept on\r\nexpanding it was cooled, the thin glass wall of the bubble congealed,\r\nand finally burst from the pressure of the steam within. This is the\r\nreason why the little dust particles are thin, mostly triangular, and\r\noften slightly concave flakes with sharp angles. Sometimes the angles\r\nappear rounded, as if the fragments had been viscid enough to creep a\r\nlittle after the bubble burst. The study of one single little grain\r\nof dust, barely visible to the naked eye, thus makes clear the nature\r\nof a catastrophe which must have shaken a whole mountain, and which\r\nleft its traces over a quarter of a continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--A PARTICLE OF VOLCANIC ASH SWELLED UP BY\r\nFUSION. Magnified 100 diameters.]\r\n\r\nThat the dust was produced in this way is quite evident from other\r\ncircumstances. If a handful from the dust of this place be thrown\r\ninto water and gently stirred, it nearly all will settle after\r\na while. But some rather large particles remain floating on the\r\nsurface. If these are removed and examined under the microscope, they\r\nare seen to be hollow spheres (Fig. 2, _b_). These are some of the\r\noriginal bubbles that never burst, either because they contained too\r\nlittle steam or else because the steam was cooled before it had time\r\nto break the walls open. It is evident that not every droplet of the\r\nmolten magma would form a single sphere, but that many also would\r\nswell up into a compound frothlike mass of pumice. A few such pieces\r\nmay sometimes be observed in the deposit at this place, and that many\r\nmore were made and broken is evident from the great number of glass\r\nfragments which have riblike edges on their flat sides (Fig. 3, _a_).\r\n\r\nThe nature of the force which caused the eruption may thus be\r\nunderstood from the study of one little grain of the dust, but much\r\nmore extended observations are needed in order to make out the place\r\nwhere the great convulsion took place. It will, perhaps, never be\r\nknown what particular volcanic vent was the source of this ash.\r\nDifferent deposits may have come from different places. But it seems\r\npossible that it all came from the same eruption. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the volcanic disturbances occurred to the west of the\r\nGreat Plains. No recent extinct volcanoes are found in any other\r\ndirection. This conclusion is corroborated by the fact that the\r\ndust is finer in eastern localities and coarser nearer the Rocky\r\nMountains. In a bed near Golden, in Colorado, seventy-three per cent,\r\nby weight, of the dust consists of particles measuring from one\r\nfourth to one thirty-second of a millimetre, while some from Orleans,\r\nin Nebraska, contains seventy-four per cent of particles measuring\r\nfrom one sixteenth to one sixty-fourth of a millimetre in diameter.\r\nStill finer material comes from the bluffs of the Missouri River near\r\nOmaha. Evidently the coarser particles would settle first, and if\r\nthe dust is finer toward the east, it must be because the wind which\r\nbrought it blew from the west. Most likely the eruption occurred\r\nsomewhere in Colorado or in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how it can be known that the dust was carried this\r\nlong distance by the wind. May it not as well have been transported\r\nby water? The answer must be, in the first place, that showers of\r\nthe same kind of material have been observed in connection with\r\nvolcanic outbursts in other parts of the world. One such shower is\r\nknown to have strewn the same kind of dust on the snow in Norway\r\nafter a volcanic eruption in Iceland, and after the great explosion\r\non Krakatoa, in 1883, such dust was carried by the wind several\r\nhundred miles, and scattered over the ocean. If this ash had been\r\ntransported by water, it would not be found in such a pure state, but\r\nit would be mixed with other sediments. There would, no doubt, also\r\nbe found coarser fragments of the volcanic products. On the contrary,\r\nit appears uniformly fine. No particles have been found which\r\nmeasure more than one millimetre in diameter, and less than one per\r\ncent of its weight consists of particles exceeding one eighth of a\r\nmillimetre in diameter. In seven samples taken from different places\r\nthe proportions of the different sizes of the grains were about as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  A = Diameter of grains in millimetres\r\n  B = Percentage of weight of each size\r\n  ---+-------+-------+--------+---------+---------+----------+-----------\r\n   A |1/2-1/4|1/4-1/8|1/8-1/16|1/16-1/32|1/32-1/64|1/64-1/128|1/128-1/256\r\n   B |  0.1  |  0.1  |   19   |    37   |   32    |    9     |     1\r\n  ---+-------+-------+--------+---------+---------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\nFlaky particles of this size are easily carried along by a moderate\r\nwind. In some places it appears as if the dust were resting on an\r\nold land surface where no water could have been standing when it\r\nfell. There is really no room for doubt that it was carried several\r\nhundred miles by the wind. It must have darkened the sky at the time,\r\nand it must have settled slowly and quietly over the wide plains,\r\ncovering extensive tracts with a white, snowlike mantle several feet\r\nin thickness. What a desolate landscape after such a shower! What a\r\ncalamity for the brute inhabitants of the land!\r\n\r\nRight here in McPherson County there was either a river or a lake at\r\nthe time of the catastrophe. This is plainly indicated in several\r\nways. In one place the dust rests on sand and clay, with imbedded\r\nshells of fresh-water clams. It is assorted in coarse and fine layers\r\nlike a water sediment. Lowermost is a seam of very coarse grains.\r\nThese must have settled promptly through the water, while the finer\r\nmaterial was delayed. In another place it lies on higher ground,\r\nand here marks of sedges and other vegetation are seen extending up\r\nabout a foot into the base of the deposit, from an underlying mucky\r\nclay. Bog manganese impregnates a thin layer just above the clay,\r\nindicating a marshy condition. Here also the material is somewhat\r\nsorted, but in a different way. It is ripple-bedded. The water was\r\nevidently shallow, if there was any water at all. A burrow like that\r\nof a crawfish extended down into the old clay bottom. On a slab of\r\nthe volcanic ash itself some tracks appeared (Fig. 4). These were\r\nprobably made by an individual of the same race in an effort to\r\nescape from the awful fate of being buried alive like the inhabitants\r\nof Herculaneum and Pompeii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--TRACKS IN THE VOLCANIC DUST, PROBABLY MADE BY\r\nA CRAWFISH. Reduced to 2/8 diameter.]\r\n\r\nThe shower must have lasted for a time of two or three days. I infer\r\nthis from the nature of the wind changes, which are indicated by the\r\nripples in the dust. These still lie in perfect preservation (Fig.\r\n5), and may be studied by removing, inch by inch, the successive\r\nlayers from above downward, for it is evident that as the direction\r\nof the wind changed, the ripples were also turned. The deciphering of\r\nthis record must be made backward. The bottom layers were deposited\r\nfirst, and the excavation must begin on top. Otherwise the record is\r\nas perfect as if it had been taken down by an instrument when the\r\nshower occurred. It may be only local in its significance, for it\r\nshows the direction of the wind at this particular place alone. The\r\nwind may have been somewhat deflected from the general direction by\r\nlocal topographic peculiarities, though these appear to have been of\r\nsmall importance. In any case, the old legend is quite interesting to\r\nread, being, I believe, the only geological record ever found of the\r\npassing of a cyclone over the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--RIPPLE MARKS IN THE VOLCANIC DUST. Reduced to\r\n1/4 diameter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--PECULIAR ELEVATIONS CAUSED BY A CURRENT FROM\r\nTHE SOUTHWEST TO THE NORTHEAST. Reduced to 1/2 diameter.]\r\n\r\nIn the lowermost foot of the deposit no ripple marks can be seen. But\r\nthere appear some marks of sedges and other vegetation, and these are\r\ninclined to the west, as if the plants had been bent by an east wind.\r\nJust above the height to which the imprints of the vegetation extend,\r\nripple marks begin to appear, running on a northeast-southwest\r\ncourse. They were made by a southeast wind, for their northwest\r\nslopes are the steeper. A little above this height some peculiar\r\nsmall elevations appear on one of the bedding planes, and slightly\r\nraised ridges run for a short distance to the northeast from each\r\nelevation, vanishing in the same direction (Fig. 6). A southwesterly\r\ncurrent was unmistakably obstructed by the little elevations, and\r\nleft the small trails of dust in their lee. Six inches higher up the\r\nwind comes more from the south, and for the next foot the ripples\r\ncontinue to gradually turn still more in the same direction so as to\r\nat last record a due south wind. At this point it suddenly changed\r\nand set in squarely from the west, for the ripples are turned north\r\nand south, with the steeper slopes to the east. This direction seems\r\nto have prevailed as long as the dust kept on falling. It appears\r\nto me that these successive changes are best explained as attendant\r\nupon the passage of a cyclone, or of what our daily weather maps call\r\na \"low area.\" Going by from west to east, on the north, it would at\r\nfirst cause an east wind. This would then gradually be turned to the\r\nsouth and then to the west. One such rotation of the wind generally\r\nlasts a day or two. The shower must then have kept on at least for\r\nthe same length of time, if not longer (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--CHANGES IN THE WIND AS RECORDED BY THE RIPPLE\r\nMARKS.]\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that this catastrophe occurred in summer.\r\nNo crayfish would be out making tracks during the cold months, and\r\nthe fossil vegetation could hardly have left such plain marks if it\r\nhad been buried by the dust during the winter. The most conspicuous\r\nof these marks are some triangular and Y-shaped molds of the stems\r\nand leaves of sedges. Siliceous skeletons of _chara_ and filamentous\r\nalgæ were also found upon a close examination in some of these molds.\r\n\r\nIt is really difficult to appreciate the change such a shower must\r\nhave produced in the appearance of the landscape, and the effect it\r\nmust have had on animal and plant life. So far away from the volcanic\r\nsource, the wind can not have laid down a layer of this dust several\r\nfeet in thickness without scattering it far and wide all around. It\r\nmust have covered tens of thousands of square miles. Just imagine,\r\nif you can, a whole State, clad in the verdure of summer, suddenly,\r\nin two or three days, covered over by a blanket of white volcanic\r\nash! Many species of plants must have found it impossible to grow\r\nin such a soil. And what disaster it must have caused in the animal\r\nworld! Grazing herds had their sustenance buried from their sight,\r\nand could save their lives only by traveling long distances in this\r\nloose dust. Many a creature must have had its lungs or its gills\r\nclogged with the glassy flakes floating in the water and in the air.\r\nThe sudden disappearance of several mammal species near the beginning\r\nof the Quaternary age has been noted by paleontologists. Does it seem\r\nunlikely that an event like this, especially if repeated, may have\r\nhastened the extermination of some species of land animals? That many\r\nindividuals must have perished there can be no doubt. Not very far\r\naway from that outcrop of the dust which I have described, one of the\r\nearly settlers in this part of the State once made a deep well that\r\npenetrated the ash. Above the deposit, and some sixty feet below the\r\nsurface of the prairie, he found what he described as \"an old bone\r\nyard.\" In digging other wells in this vicinity mammal bones have been\r\ntaken up by the settlers from about the same horizon. It is to be\r\nregretted that, with one exception, none of these fossils have been\r\npreserved for study, for it is likely that they were the remains of\r\nanimals which were killed in the dust shower.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of fossils definitely known to be connected with the\r\nash, its exact age seems yet uncertain. In McPherson County it is\r\nunderlaid by clay, gravel, and sand, which contain remains of the\r\nhorse, of a megalonyx, and of bivalve mollusks of modern aspect. In\r\nthe bluffs of the Missouri River near Omaha pockets of a similar\r\nash rest on glacial clay under the loess. At the latter place it\r\nmust belong to the Pleistocene age, and at the former it can not be\r\nolder than the late Pleiocene. These two deposits may not belong\r\nto the same shower, but it appears, at any rate, that the volcanic\r\ndisturbances which produced them occurred near the beginning of the\r\nPleistocene age.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the slow and even tenor of the routine of\r\ngeological history, the event here sketched appears so unique and\r\nso striking that it may well be called a geological romance. Modern\r\nscience has taught us that the geological forces are slow and largely\r\nuniform in their work, and that most of the earth's features must be\r\nexplained without taking recourse to theories involving any violent\r\nrevolutions or general terrestrial cataclysms. While the making of\r\nthis dust is not any real exception to the law of uniformity, we are\r\nhere reminded that Nature is quite independent in her ways, and that\r\neven in her sameness there is room for considerable diversity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Mr. William Ogilvie, of the Topographical Survey of Canada,\r\n     estimates that there are more than 3,200 miles of fair navigation\r\n     in the system of the Yukon River, of which Canada owns nearly\r\n     forty-two per cent. A remarkable feature of the river, with its\r\n     Lewes branch, is that it drains the Peninsula of Alaska and nearly\r\n     cuts it in two, starting as it does less than fourteen miles, \"as\r\n     the crow flies,\" from the waters of the Pacific Ocean, at the\r\n     extreme head of the Lewes branch, whence it flows 2,100 miles into\r\n     the same ocean, or Bering Sea, which is a part of it. The drainage\r\n     basin of the river occupies about 388,000 square miles, of which\r\n     Canada owns 149,000 square miles, or nearly half, but that half\r\n     is claimed to be the most important. As for the origin of the\r\n     name Yukon, the Indians along the middle stretches of the river\r\n     all speak the same language, and call the river the Yukonah; in\r\n     English, \"the great river\" or \"the river.\" The Canadian Indians\r\n     in the vicinity of Forty Mile call it \"Thetuh,\" a name of which\r\n     Mr. Ogilvie could not learn the meaning. The correct Indian name\r\n     of the Klondike is _Troandik_, meaning Hammer Creek, and refers\r\n     to the barriers the Indians used to erect across the mouth of the\r\n     stream to catch salmon, by hammering sticks into the ground.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[31] Dr. Samuel Aughey, Physical Geography of Nebraska, 1880.

I say \"roughly\r\nspeaking\" with due humility, having the fear of the expert ever\r\nbefore my eyes, because I know that if I do not sing small, that\r\ninconvenient person, the astronomical critic, will come down upon\r\nme at once like a wolf on the fold, with minute distinctions about\r\nthe mean, the tropical, and the sidereal year; matters of immense\r\nimportance at Greenwich Observatory, no doubt, but elsewhere of very\r\nlittle interest indeed, seeing that they differ from one another\r\nby so many minutes only. Let us leave the astronomers their own\r\nproblems. The year with which I am going to deal humbly here is a\r\nmuch more commonplace, ordinary, and comprehensible year--the visible\r\nyear of vegetation, of plant and animal life, of the four seasons;\r\nthe year as roughly known to children and savages, and to the weeds,\r\nthe flowers, the bees, and the squirrels.\r\n\r\nIt has often struck me as curious that people took this complex\r\nconcept of the year so much for granted--inquired so little into its\r\norigin and discovery. Yet it is by no means everywhere obvious. How\r\ndid men first come to notice, in the tropics especially, that there\r\nwas such a thing as the year at all? How did they first observe, save\r\nin our frozen north, any fixed sequence or order in the succession of\r\nNature? How did they learn, even here, that spring would infallibly\r\nfollow winter, and summer be succeeded in due course by autumn?\r\nAnd, to go a step farther back, how did the plants and animals, in\r\nall parts of the world alike, come originally to discover and adapt\r\nthemselves to all these things? How did the bee know that she must\r\n\"gather honey all the day from every opening flower,\" the summer\r\nthrough, in order to use it up as bodily fuel in winter? How did the\r\nplants learn when to blossom and produce seed? In one word, how did\r\nthe seasons come to be automatically recognized?\r\n\r\nThat they _are_ automatically recognized, even by plants, quite\r\napart from the stimulus of heat or cold, drought or rain, a single\r\nfact (out of many like it) will sufficiently prove. Trees brought\r\nfrom Australia to England, where the seasons are reversed, try for\r\ntwo or three years to put forth leaves and flowers in October or\r\nNovember--the southern spring. It takes them several autumns before\r\nthey learn that the year has been turned upside down--that June is\r\nnow summer and December winter. This shows that life moves in regular\r\ncycles, adapted to the seasons, but not directly dependent upon\r\nthem. The rhythm of the world has set up an organic rhythm which now\r\nspontaneously and automatically follows it.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, to the dweller in the temperate zone at the present\r\nday, the questions I have put above may seem needless, not to say\r\nchildish. But that is perhaps because we have all too much the\r\nhabit of taking it for granted that what is true here and now has\r\nalso been true everywhere and always. A first visit to the tropics\r\noften enough rudely disturbs this uninquiring attitude of mind. For\r\nin the tropics, and especially in the equatorial region, there is\r\nno winter and no summer, no spring and no autumn. The world wags\r\nwearily through an unending display of monotonous greenery. As far as\r\ntemperature goes, the year is pretty much alike in all its months.\r\nYet not only do equatorial men recognize the existence of the year as\r\na natural epoch quite as much as other men--not only do equatorial\r\nsavages celebrate annual feasts, count ages by years, and perform\r\ncertain rites in certain months only--but also animal and vegetable\r\nnature recognizes the year; trees have their month for blossoming and\r\nfruiting, birds their month for assuming the plumage of courtship,\r\nfor nesting and hatching, almost as markedly as elsewhere. The\r\nrecognition of the year both by man and by Nature is not therefore\r\nentirely dependent upon the difference of summer and winter, as such.\r\nWe must go deeper, and I think, when we come to consider geological\r\ntime, much deeper, if we wish to understand the true character of\r\nyearliness--a word which I venture here to coin to express this\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nHave you ever quite realized what the tropical year is like? Suppose\r\nyou are living on or near the equator, then in December the sun is\r\nsouth of you and at its greatest distance away; you have, so to\r\nspeak, a relative winter. But in March the sun is overhead; it is\r\nnow full midsummer. By the end of June the sun has gone north, and\r\nis once more on a tropic; you have a second winter; not much of\r\na winter, I admit, but still, a relative winter. By September he\r\nhas returned overhead again, and you are enduring a second summer.\r\nIn December he has once more retreated to the southern tropic\r\n(Capricorn), and it is comparative winter. Thus the equatorial year\r\nconsists of four distinct seasons, in two of which the sun stands\r\ndirectly overhead, while in two he is at his northern or southern\r\nlimit. I may add that the effect is always curious when, as you face\r\nthe sun, you see that he is moving in his diurnal path, not from\r\nleft to right (\"the way of the sun,\" as we say), but from right to\r\nleft (or \"widdershins\"). You are never till then aware how natural\r\nand inevitable has seemed the opposite direction: when you find it\r\nreversed the effect is surprising.\r\n\r\nNow, the distance to which the sun travels north or south of you, if\r\nyou live on the equator--I use ordinary terms instead of astronomical\r\nones for simplicity's sake--is so comparatively small that within the\r\ntropics themselves you never notice much difference as to the amount\r\nof heat between one period of the year and another. In equatorial\r\ncountries the day and night temperature is much the same all the year\r\nround: if the country be plain, it is always hot; if mountainous,\r\nlike the district about Bogotá, it is \"a perpetual spring\"; one day\r\nis always much the same as the one that went before and the one that\r\ncomes after it. Even on the actual tropics, again, the difference\r\nis too slight to make any marked change in the temperature; people\r\nliving on the northern tropic (Cancer), for example, have the sun\r\nvertical to them on June 21st, and some forty-three degrees south of\r\nthem on December 21st. Nevertheless, the sun is still as near them\r\nand as powerful as he is at Milan or Venice in the height of summer;\r\nand the consequence is that, as a matter of fact, the thermometer\r\nwithin the tropics and at sea level seldom descends below 75° or\r\n80°, even at midnight in the relative winters. For the heating power\r\nof the sun depends, of course, upon the directness of his rays, and\r\nlessens with their obliquity; in Venice and Milan they are strong\r\nenough to make the ground very hot in July and August, though it has\r\nbeen cooled before by a northern winter; much more than in Jamaica or\r\nMadagascar, which have never been cooled, does the accumulated heat\r\nkeep everything warm even when the sun is most oblique--and he never\r\nreaches the same obliquity as in an English summer. The ground is\r\nhot, the houses are hot, wood and stone are hot, and they have all\r\nbeen hot from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nYet tropical and equatorial trees and plants have their definite\r\nseasons to flower and fruit, just the same as elsewhere. This seems\r\nsurprising at first when one visits the tropics. You can not see\r\nwhy everything should not flower and fruit the whole year round.\r\nAnd yet, at one time pineapples are \"in,\" at another mangoes. And\r\nthese seasons differ in the northern and southern hemispheres; what\r\nis mango winter in the one being mango summer in the other. I do\r\nnot say the seasons anywhere in the tropics differ markedly; still,\r\nthey do differ; the tropical year is divided into times and months\r\nfor agriculture just as much as any other. Thus there are regular\r\ndates in each hemisphere for planting, tending, and cutting the sugar\r\ncane. Now, what is the reason of these changes in vegetation, when\r\ntemperature remains so constant? Why do not trees and shrubs of each\r\nkind flower up and down throughout the year irregularly--now one\r\nindividual and now another? Why are there seasons for things at all\r\nin the tropics?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, because the same causes which produce summer and\r\nwinter in temperate climate produce other changes of other sorts in\r\nthe tropical region. The temperature, it is true, remains the same,\r\nor approximately the same; but the meteorological conditions vary.\r\nEven with ourselves, summer is not only hotter but also drier than\r\nwinter; winter is marked by rain and snow as well as by lowered\r\ntemperature. In the tropics, on the other hand, it is rather the\r\nsummer or summers that are wet, for there is a certain moving zone\r\nof equatorial calms in which it practically keeps on raining always.\r\nBut this zone is not fixed; it flits with the sun. When the sun goes\r\nnorthward for the northern summer the rainy zone goes with him; when\r\nhe turns southward again the zone shifts after him. Thus places on\r\nor near the two tropics have one rainy season a year, while places\r\non the equator have usually two. The intervening dry seasons are\r\noften very dry and parched, indeed; and where this is markedly the\r\ncase, the rainy season acts just as spring does in the north, or as\r\nthe inundation does in Egypt; it is the beginning of vegetation.\r\nThe plants that were dry and dormant during the arid months wake up\r\ninto fresh life; the branches put forth new leaves; the brown seeds\r\ngerminate; the flowers appear; and in due time the fruit ripens.\r\nEverything in these cases depends upon the recurrence of the rainy\r\nseason, just as everything in India depends upon the bursting of the\r\nmonsoons, and everything in Egypt on the rising of the Nile. I have\r\nseen a dry plain in Jamaica bare and brown one day, and covered six\r\nor eight inches high with fresh green waving guinea-grass the day\r\nbut one after. The rains had come meanwhile, and Nature had awaked\r\nwith more than springlike awakening. In those hot climates everything\r\ngrows by magic as soon as it gets the needed water.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we may say that in half the world the seasons, organically\r\nspeaking--I mean, the seasons of plant and animal life--depend upon\r\nheat and cold, summer and winter, snow or sunshine; but in the other\r\nhalf they depend almost entirely upon drought and rainfall. Even as\r\nnear home and as far north as Algeria, the summer is far too dry\r\nand dusty for agriculture; the autumn rains set in about October\r\nor November; they are immediately followed by the plowing; and the\r\nwinter becomes for most purposes the practical summer. Fruits and\r\nvegetables are at their best in January and February; the fields\r\nare full of flowers up to March or April; in June, July, and August\r\nthe country is an arid and weary desert. But the seasons for dates\r\nare almost reversed; they ripen in autumn. In Egypt again, where\r\neverything depends upon the inundation, the seasons are still more\r\ncomplicated; the inundation begins to subside in October; in Upper\r\nEgypt the winter season which follows is far the most important\r\nfor agriculture, and crops sown as the water subsides are reaped\r\nfrom four to seven months after. But in the Delta, rice, cotton,\r\nand indigo are sown in the spring (March or April) and harvested in\r\nOctober, November, and December. Here, irrigation and temperature\r\ncome in as disturbing elements, for the Delta feels something of the\r\ncold of winter.\r\n\r\nI could give many other instances, but these will suffice. As a\r\ngeneral rule, we may say that in the temperate and frigid zones the\r\nseasons for plants and animals are ruled by heat and cold, but that\r\nin tropical and even in subtropical climates, rainfall and drought,\r\nthemselves largely due to the same circumstances, are the ruling\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nAgain, everybody knows that winter and summer, and the other\r\nphenomena which simulate or accompany them, such as wet and\r\ndry seasons, depend upon the fact that the earth's axis is not\r\nperpendicular to the plane in which the earth moves round the sun,\r\nbut slightly inclined to it. Now, a year in itself, viewed as a\r\nmeasure of time, is merely the period which it takes the earth to\r\nperform one such complete revolution. During one half of each such\r\nrevolution the north pole is turned at a considerable angle toward\r\nthe sun, and during the other half, the south pole. When the north\r\npole is so turned we call it summer in the northern hemisphere;\r\nwhen the south pole is being favored, and the north is receiving\r\nless light and heat, we call it winter. Let us suppose for a moment\r\nthat the earth had not got this twist or kink in its axis; that\r\nthe equator was always presented exactly toward the sun; what then\r\nwould happen? Obviously, there would be no change of seasons. The\r\nday and night would have fixed lengths which never varied; climate\r\nwould in each place be uniform and, barring accidents of elevation\r\nor distribution of land and water, the climate of each place would\r\nalso depend entirely the whole year round on its distance from the\r\nequator. Roughly speaking, the temperature of a district would be\r\nthe temperature it now possesses in March and September, only not\r\nquite so cold as March nor so warm as September, owing to the absence\r\nof accumulated heat from summer or of reserves of ice and snow from\r\nwinter. In one word, under such conditions there would have been\r\nclimates--marked belts of climate; but there would not have been\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nSeasons, however, depend in great part, as Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace\r\nhas ingeniously shown, on a great many things besides this mere\r\ninclination of one end or the other of the earth toward the sun in\r\nJune and January. Much must be laid to the count of accumulated\r\nstores of heat or cold; and though accumulated cold is physically a\r\nmisnomer, still for all practical purposes we may apply the words\r\nfairly enough to the ice caps of the pole and the glaciers of\r\nmountain systems. And here we come face to face with the very core\r\nof our problem: for the odd part of it is that seasons (at least as\r\nwe know them) seem to be quite a recent and exceptional phenomenon\r\nin the history of our planet. So far as we can judge, geologically\r\nspeaking, the earth during all its earlier life enjoyed, over all\r\nits surface, what we should now consider tropical or subtropical\r\nconditions. England--or rather the land that occupied the part of\r\nthe earth's crust where England now stands--had a vegetation of huge\r\ntree ferns and palms and cycads during the Primary period; as late\r\neven as the middle Tertiaries it had a vegetation like that of South\r\nCarolina or Upper India. Greenland itself, in quite recent times,\r\nflourished like a green bay tree, and did not belie its odd modern\r\nname. The world as a whole enjoyed perpetual summer. In one word,\r\nexcept in something like the equatorial sense, there were practically\r\nno seasons. The sun went north and south, no doubt, as now, but the\r\ntemperature, even in the relative winter, seems to have remained\r\nperennially mild and genial.\r\n\r\nIt is true, occasional slight traces of glacial epochs, earlier than\r\nthe great and well-known Glacial epoch, break here and there the\r\nalmost continuous geological record of palmy and balmy world-wide\r\nsummers; yet, taking the geological monuments as a whole, they show\r\nus few or no signs of anything worth calling a serious winter till\r\nquite recent periods. Large-leaved evergreens are still, in the\r\nday-before-yesterday of geology, the order of the day; magnolias\r\nand liquidambars, cinnamons and holly oaks, vines and rotang palms\r\nformed the forests even of Miocene Britain. The animals during\r\nall the Tertiary period were of what we now regard as tropical or\r\nsubtropical types--lions, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, monkeys, or\r\nmore antique races, equally southern in aspect. There could have\r\nbeen little change of winter and summer during this long warm spell;\r\nthe variations can have been scarcely more than those of dry and\r\nrainy seasons. The trees never lost their leaves; the fruits and\r\nflowers never ceased to follow one another; no interruption of the\r\nfood supply drove insects to hibernate in their silken cocoons, or\r\nsquirrels and bears to lay by stores of food or fat for the cold and\r\nhungry winter.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, taking the world round as it stands, we must believe\r\nthat the distinction of seasons grew up, both for plants and animals,\r\nand for man or his ancestors, during this age of relatively unmarked\r\nsummers and winters. For the tropics more than anywhere else preserve\r\nfor us to-day the general features and aspect of this earlier time;\r\nthey have never had the continuity of their stream of life rudely\r\ninterrupted by the enormous changes of the Glacial epoch. Yet, even\r\nin the tropics, things, as we saw, have seasons. There are annuals\r\nand perennials there, as elsewhere. Each kind has its month for\r\nsprouting, for flowering, for fruiting, for shedding its seed; and\r\nmen in the tropics, some of them long isolated in oceanic islands,\r\nor in great insulated regions like Australia or New Guinea, from the\r\nrest of their kind in the temperate regions, nevertheless know and\r\nobserve the year, and perform all their functions, agricultural or\r\nreligious, by yearly cycles. For example, there is among them all\r\nan annual feast for the dead, and widows mourn their husbands for\r\none year from their burial. Observation of the year, therefore, both\r\nautomatically by organisms at large and consciously by man, antedates\r\nand is independent of observation of the existence of summer or\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nI do not think, however, that man would have noted the merely\r\nastronomical year--the year of the sun's position--at least till a\r\nrelatively late stage in culture, if he had not first noticed the\r\norganic year--the regular recurrence of plant and animal seasons. So\r\nmany yams--that is to say, so many yam harvests--in other words, so\r\nmany years, is a common savage way of reckoning times and ages. But\r\nthey call it \"yams,\" not summers or winters. And when I say yams, I\r\ngive that merely as a single instance, for elsewhere the \"seedtime\r\nand harvest\" are reckoned indifferently in maize or millet, rice\r\nor barley, according to the agriculture of the particular people.\r\nEven hunting races know that at certain times of year certain foods\r\nabound; and this is true of equatorial savages and equatorial plants\r\nor animals, as well as of others.\r\n\r\nMoons are more obvious measures of time than suns, in the tropics at\r\nleast--probably everywhere; for the waxing and waning of the moon\r\nmean much to people who live largely out of doors; and the month is,\r\nperhaps, the earliest fixed mode of reckoning time beyond a day or\r\ntwo. Most savages count time mainly by so many moons. But they must\r\nalso have noticed early that after a certain number of moons (usually\r\nabout thirteen), certain fruits or seeds were ripe again; especially\r\nmust they have noticed it when this recurrence coincided with the\r\nreturn of the rainy season, or of some other annual meteorological\r\nphenomenon, like the bursting of the monsoon or the Nile inundation.\r\nThus, even in the tropics, and before the coming on of the Glacial\r\nepoch, men or the ancestors of men (one can not draw precise lines\r\nhere) must probably have observed a certain rough relation between\r\nthe months and the vegetative cycles; after so many moons, about say\r\nthirteen, the yam, or the mangoes, or the grains are ripe again.\r\nThese organic years, I take it, must have been noticed before the\r\nastronomical ones. For it is now beginning to be more and more\r\nbelieved that man is of preglacial origin; and even if something\r\nworth calling a man were not, then at least man's pre-human\r\nancestors go back far into the Tertiary period. Only later would men\r\nbegin to note that some thirteen moons, and the recurrence of a food\r\nstuff, concurred with a particular solar season.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if one comes to think of it, how much even now do any of us,\r\nsave the most scientific, mean by the year, beyond the visible change\r\nof summer and winter? What we are thinking of is the leafless trees,\r\nthe ice and snow, the green grass in spring, the flowers and warm\r\ndays in summer, not the abstract astronomical fact of the earth's\r\nrevolution round the sun, or the due succession of the signs of the\r\nzodiac. It is that visible organic year that must have counted most\r\nwith man from the first; though no doubt its meaning and reality are\r\nmuch more vividly present since the coming on of the Glacial epoch,\r\nand the more so in proportion as we live nearer to the north or\r\nsouth pole; while at the equator the year is to the last a much more\r\ninconspicuous period--a largely artificial mode of reckoning.\r\n\r\nStill, from the very first, there was one element of diversity in\r\nthe year which must have struck all men, in the temperate and frigid\r\nzones at least, perhaps even in a certain way in the tropics. I mean,\r\nthe varying length of the day, always perceptible in the frigid and\r\ntemperate zones; for as soon as men in these regions began to think\r\nand to observe at all, they must have noticed that the days increased\r\nin their summer and lessened in their winter; and they must have\r\nlearned to correlate this waxing and waning of the day with the\r\nappearance or abundance of certain fruits, seeds, birds, fishes,\r\ngame, roots and other food stuffs. It is at least certain that all\r\nthe world over men do now celebrate the solstices and the equinoxes\r\nas special feasts; and the close similarity in most such celebrations\r\nleads one to suspect that the custom has been handed down from the\r\nvery remote time when the human family was still a single continuous\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics, it is true, the days vary so little that this\r\ndifference in itself is not likely to have struck primæval man. But\r\nthere, another point would come in--the annual movement of the sun\r\noverhead from south to north and _vice versa_; and though this would\r\nbe less directly important to human life than in temperate regions,\r\nit would still be indirectly important. It would bring the rain with\r\nit. In Europe, of course, and in temperate America, we can see at\r\nonce that the return of the sun northward must always have meant\r\nspring, the increase of food stuffs, the promise of corn or maize,\r\nthe suggestion of harvest; and we can therefore understand why the\r\nmidwinter feast, when the sun after his long journey south begins\r\nto move visibly north again, should have been both in pagan and\r\nChristian times the great festival of rejoicing for the men of the\r\nnorth temperate region. Day by day they saw the sun recede and the\r\ncold deepen; at last, one evening, he sets a little nearer, and they\r\nknow that he has not deserted them forever. Similarly, the promise\r\nmade at Yule begins to be realized at that other great feast of\r\nthe spring equinox, which we still call in England by its ancient\r\nheathen title of Easter; the day by that time has got the better of\r\nthe night, and \"the sun dances on Easter Sunday\" in commemoration\r\nof his completed victory over the combined powers of winter and\r\ndarkness. In the tropics, on the other hand, the connection is less\r\nclear; but even here the shifting of the sun's apparent place is\r\nclosely correlated with the shifting of the rain zone; and therefore\r\nit would not be long (after man was man) before tropical savages\r\nbegan to perceive a constant relation between the movements of the\r\nsun to north or south, and the occurrence of the fertilizing rainy\r\nseason. We must remember that savages, with their improvident habits,\r\nare much more dependent upon rain than we are, and that magical\r\nceremonies for breaking up a drought are among their commonest and\r\nmost universally diffused superstitions.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, before the coming on of the Glacial epoch, we may\r\nbe pretty sure that plants and animals on the one hand had learned\r\norganically and automatically to recognize the existence of the year\r\nand to adapt themselves to it; and that men or the progenitors of\r\nmen on the other hand had also learned to correlate the recurrent\r\nseasons of food supply with the movements of the sun, though nothing\r\nequivalent to winter and summer as we know them to-day existed as\r\nyet on any part of our planet. I say advisedly \"on any part of our\r\nplanet,\" because even near the pole itself remains of a subtropical\r\nvegetation in Tertiary times have been amply indicated. Nevertheless,\r\nin all parts of the world then, as in the tropics now, we may gather\r\nthat plants and animals ran through annual cycles--that the year, as\r\nI have put it, was organically recognized. Trees had their time to\r\nsprout, to bud, to flower, to fruit, to seed, to shed their leaves\r\n(in the evergreen way); birds had their time to nest and hatch out\r\ntheir young; insects had their fixed periods for laying, for larval\r\nlife, for assuming the chrysalis form, for becoming winged beetles or\r\nbees or butterflies. In one word, the year is a terrestrial reality,\r\nnot merely an astronomical fact, in the tropics now; it was a\r\nterrestrial reality over the whole planet in the Tertiary period. But\r\nit was hardly more marked, apparently, into distinct seasons than it\r\nis marked to-day in the equatorial region. Rainfall and drought must\r\nhave had more to do in determining the annual cycles than winter and\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it must result that the conception of the year as an\r\nepoch at all (save for advanced astronomy) is almost or entirely\r\ndue to that tilt of the earth's axis which causes the seasons--dry\r\nor wet, cold or hot. Without the seasons, in one form or other, we\r\nmight have been ages longer in discovering the fact that the earth\r\nmoved round the sun, and that some three hundred and sixty-five days\r\n(I omit those important fractions) were needed for its revolution.\r\nCertainly, without the seasons, at least to the extent that they\r\noccur in the tropics, plant and animal life could hardly have assumed\r\nits fixed annual cycles, nor could early men have caught at the idea\r\nof the year at all as a period of time, a unit of measurement.\r\n\r\nBefore the Glacial epoch, in particular, the discovery of the year,\r\norganically or consciously, must have been much more difficult than\r\nit is now in high latitudes. It must have been almost as difficult\r\nin what are now the temperate zones as it is to-day in the tropics.\r\nFar north or south, of course, the length of the day would tell;\r\nand within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles the long night would\r\nform an unmistakable feature. But if the plane of the equator had\r\nalways found itself vertical to the sun, there could have been no\r\nrecognition of the year at all, either organic or conscious. In\r\nother words, from the point of view of organic life, the year does\r\nnot mean the revolution of the earth round the sun: it means the\r\napparent northward and southward movement of the sun on either side\r\nof the equator; it means the seasons, whether recognized as winter\r\nand summer, or as dry and wet periods. That is really the year as man\r\nknows it, as plants and animals have always known it.\r\n\r\nWith the coming on of the great cold spell, however, the importance\r\nof the seasons in the temperate and frigid zones, perhaps also\r\neven in the tropics, became much more marked. I will not go here\r\ninto the suggested reasons for that vast revolution, perhaps the\r\ngreatest our planet has ever suffered. Most physicists now accept\r\nmore or less the theory put forward with great ingenuity by Mr.\r\nCroll, which sets it down to a period of extreme eccentricity in the\r\nearth's orbit; but some weight must also be allowed, as Mr. Alfred\r\nRussel Wallace has clearly shown, to the local arrangement of land\r\nand water on the globe at the time of its origin, as well as to the\r\noccurrence of mountain ranges just then at the poles, and to other\r\npurely terrestrial causes. Never before, in all probability, had the\r\npoles been occupied by great glacier-clad mountains. It seems most\r\nlikely, indeed, that we are now practically at the end of the Glacial\r\nepoch, and that if only we could once get rid of the polar ice caps,\r\nwhich keep a stock of chilliness always laid on (I speak the quite\r\ncomprehensible language of everyday life), we might recur forthwith\r\nto the warm and almost imperceptible winters of the preglacial\r\nperiod. But, as things stand, the stock of ice at the poles never\r\ngets melted away in the existing northern or southern summer; fresh\r\nice accumulates on top of the old mass with each winter; prevailing\r\nwinds, blowing over this ice, chill regions lying much farther\r\ntoward the tropics; icebergs detach themselves and float off, thus\r\nlowering the temperature of the sea in the middle zones; arctic or\r\nantarctic currents spread round the coasts and absorb the solar\r\nheat in enormous quantities. We have only to remember the trenchant\r\ndifference in England between a parching cold east wind and a mild\r\nsou'wester to realize what an immense part these polar ice caps and\r\nfrozen highlands play in the production of our existing winter. Alps,\r\nPyrenees, Himalayas, Rocky Mountains, further assist in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, currents in the sea may cut either way; the Gulf\r\nStream makes England warm, while the arctic current makes Labrador,\r\nmuch farther south, practically uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nEver since the Glacial epoch, therefore, it has been quite easy\r\nfor man in the temperate and frigid zones to recognize the year as\r\na natural reality. The annual cycles of heat and cold are far too\r\nmarked to be overlooked by anybody. Organically, they made themselves\r\nfelt at once by extraordinary changes induced in the fauna and flora.\r\nBefore the steady advance of the annual cold wave, vegetation had\r\nperforce to alter its ways. The large-leaved evergreens went out\r\naltogether in frigid and high temperate regions; deciduous trees,\r\nor needle-leaved types like the pines and firs, took the place of\r\nthe luxuriant Miocene foliage in Europe and North America. Every\r\nautumn the larger number of trees and shrubs learned to shed their\r\nleaves all together; every spring they came out anew in fresh green\r\nand in masses of blossom. Similarly with animals. Birds learned to\r\nmigrate, or to accommodate themselves to the winter; insects learned\r\nto hibernate in the egg or the cocoon; pigs fattened themselves on\r\nmast against the frozen time; moles slept over winter; squirrels\r\nhoarded nuts for a store to bridge over heavy frosts; frogs retired\r\nto the warmer mud in the depths of ponds; adders coiled themselves in\r\nholes and dozed away the cold season. Innumerable adaptations sprang\r\nup at once, those species or individuals which failed to meet the\r\nnew conditions perishing in the struggle. In proportion as we recede\r\nfrom the tropics, the more marked do the annual cycles of life thus\r\ninduced become, many species practically ceasing to exist as such for\r\nseveral months of the year, and being only potentially represented by\r\neggs, germs, or seeds, and sometimes by dormant pregnant females.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, while the cause of the seasons as a whole is the\r\nobliquity of the earth's axis, with the resulting inclination of\r\neither pole toward the sun alternately, we must not forget that the\r\nseasons and the climate in each particular country depend in part\r\nupon many minor contributory causes. It is not merely nearness to\r\nor distance from the equator that counts; we have to consider also\r\nrelative distribution of land and water, elevation, prevalent winds,\r\nexposure, condensation, and many other elements of a complex problem.\r\nIn Ecuador, for example, whose very name means the equator, the plain\r\nis always in scorching summer, the mountains are always in perpetual\r\nspring. The monsoons, again, produce in other countries some curious\r\nresults: they depend themselves on the change of relative temperature\r\nin sea and land at different seasons; and they break upon the\r\nHimalayas with this odd and unexpected effect, that the snow line on\r\nthe southern side of that vast range goes very far down, owing to\r\nthe immense rainfall (or rather snowfall) and the consequent spread\r\nof snow fields and glaciers; while on the northern side it descends\r\nbut a very little way, owing to the extreme desert drought and the\r\ngreat summer heat of the central Asiatic table-land. We have thus the\r\napparent paradox that millions of Tibetans occupy towns and cultivate\r\nfarms to the north at a height from three to four thousand feet above\r\nthe snow line on the southern slope of the same mountains.\r\n\r\nLooking at the matter broadly, then, and taking for granted the\r\nnow generally accepted modern view that the great oceans and great\r\ncontinents have been relatively fixed (though liable to minor\r\nfluctuations and variations of outline) throughout all geological\r\ntime, and that the earth's crust has not shifted from pole to\r\nequator or vice versa, we arrive at last at the following probable\r\nconclusions: There have always been seasons more or less marked, and\r\nthese have been more or less organically answered by corresponding\r\nchanges or cycles of change in plants and animals. Rain and drought\r\nhave in many cases more to do with such changes than variations of\r\ntemperature. The seasons, again, are less marked in the tropics\r\nthan in temperate and circumpolar climates. Nevertheless, even near\r\nthe equator, they exert and have always exerted certain organic\r\ninfluences-have resulted in annual cycles in the life of species.\r\nEven before the coming on of the Glacial epoch, the seasons were\r\nprobably somewhat more marked in the temperate and polar regions than\r\nin the tropics, the longer day in summer and the greater directness\r\nof impact of the rays making the summer months always warmer. But\r\nfor various reasons, among which we may presumably rank the absence\r\nin early ages of high land at the poles and of an accumulated polar\r\nice cap, together with the existence of warm sea currents from the\r\ntropics to the poles, the winters of preglacial ages seem to have\r\nbeen relatively mild, perhaps (if we may judge by the types of plant\r\nlife) milder than those of South Carolina and Georgia in our own\r\nperiod. No cold winds of importance seem then to have blown with\r\nblighting effect from glaciated or snow-clad districts. (Mars in our\r\nown time appears to enjoy winters somewhat of this character, though\r\na little colder, with a temporary snow cap.) The seasons as we know\r\nthem in temperate and arctic climates, however, seem to be largely\r\nthe result of the glacial epoch, and its persistent legacy the arctic\r\nand antarctic ice caps. If we could once manage to get rid of those,\r\nit is possible that our planet might again enjoy in all its zones the\r\nmild and genial preglacial winters.\r\n\r\nThese are rough notes, I know; mere adumbrations of a probable\r\ntruth: but adequately to develop the subject would require a very\r\nbig volume. My object here is simply to suggest that in many\r\ninquiries, both into human and animal or vegetable life, we must\r\nnever take the existence of seasons as we know them for granted,\r\nexcept in very recent times. The year, for organic beings, means\r\nessentially the seasons; and the seasons may mean and have meant\r\nmany separate things, as time and place vary--heat and cold, food\r\nand scarcity, foliage and leaflessness, drought and wet; longer or\r\nshorter days, the midnight sun and the winter darkness; hibernation\r\nand wakefulness; the egg, the cocoon, the seed, the plant, the\r\nflower, the fruit; dormancy or vitality. According as human life\r\nstarted at the poles or the equator, for instance, it would view in\r\nthe beginning many things differently. All I wish to point out now\r\nis merely this, that we must bear such possibilities ever in mind;\r\nand that we must never take it for granted in any problem, human or\r\nbiological, that the seasons were always just what we know them,\r\nor that the year to any organic being meant anything more than the\r\nseasonal cycle then and there prevalent.--_Longman's Magazine._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In the excavations of the ancient cemetery of Antinoe, near Lyons,\r\n     France, a \"party dress\" of the time of the Emperor Adrian, very\r\n     fine silks, jewels, etc., have been discovered.

D.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving been for thirty years a lecturer on man and his character\r\nas evinced by his form, features, head, and gestures, and having\r\nmade observations on the subject in all parts of North America, in\r\ncontinental Europe and Great Britain, and parts of Asia, Africa, and\r\nAustralia, I should not be deemed presumptuous when I present a few\r\nfacts regarding the relations of mind and the size and forms of heads\r\nand weights of brains. It has been observed by many persons versed\r\nin the branches relating to the subject that men with the largest\r\nbrains are not those of most talent, power, or intellect; but many\r\nsuch have been only ordinary or inferior men, or even idiots; while\r\nsome men of most powerful and comprehensive minds have had unusually\r\nsmall brains. Esquirol's assertion that no size or form of head or\r\nbrain is incident to idiocy or to superior talent is borne out by my\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nAfter long and careful research in the great libraries and museums\r\nof the world, I have collected a table of brain weights of eminent\r\nmen, along with which are entered, in my original document, the\r\noccupation of the subject, age at the time of determination, and the\r\nsource whence the item is derived. These can not be given within the\r\nlimits of this article, and only the briefest and most generalized\r\nsummary of the main features can be indicated. The largest weight of\r\nbrain in the whole list is that of the Russian novelist Turgenieff,\r\nwhose brain weighed, at the time of his death, at sixty-five years\r\nof age, 71 ounces.[32] It is a considerable step from him to the\r\nnext in order, the English mechanician and author, Knight, whose\r\nbrain weight at the age of fifty-eight was 64 ounces. Then follow the\r\nScottish physician Abercrombie, 63 ounces; General B. F. Butler, 62\r\nounces; and the Scottish general Abercromby, 62 ounces. Another group\r\nof nine, including weights from 58.6 ounces to 54 ounces, includes\r\nJeffrey, Scottish judge and author, Thackeray, Cuvier, George Combe,\r\nUnited States Senator Atherton, Spurzheim, and the Scottish physician\r\nSimpson. The next group, 53.6 to 50, is larger, including twenty-one\r\nnames, among which are Daniel Webster, Agassiz, Napoleon I, the\r\nScottish divine Chalmers, the mathematicians De Morgan and Gauss, the\r\nanthropologist Broca, and the generals Skoboleff and Lamarque. The\r\nlast group, 49.9 to 40 ounces, contains twenty-five names, including\r\nthose of the philosopher Huber, Grote, Babbage, the anthropologist\r\nBertillon, Whewell,[33] Liebig, Gall, Gambetta, and Bishop, the mind\r\nreader. Only one remove from the foot of the list is Gambetta, a man\r\nof indisputably high genius and ability, with a brain weighing only\r\n40.9 ounces.[34]\r\n\r\nThe table goes to illustrate a general rule which I discovered and\r\npublished several years ago, that larger brains appertain to natives\r\nof colder climates. Dr. John Abercrombie, for instance, was born\r\nat Aberdeen, Scotland, on the German Sea, and farther north than\r\nany part of the United States. Sir Ralph Abercromby was born in\r\nthe county of Clackmannan, Scotland, where it is far colder than\r\nany part of southern Europe. Lord Francis Jeffrey first saw light\r\nin Edinburgh. General Butler was born in Deerfield, New Hampshire.\r\nIvan Turgenieff, with the heaviest brain of all, was a native of\r\ncold, inhospitable Russia. Dr. Franz Joseph Gall (brain weight 42.2\r\nounces)[35] was born in Würtemberg, in southern Germany, passed\r\nmost of his life in Vienna and Paris, and, being a student, spent\r\nmuch of his time indoors. Gambetta was born at Cahors, France, of\r\nItalian parents. This climatological view of the size of brains\r\nis confirmed by a paper, \"Crania,\" of the Philadelphia Academy of\r\nSciences, which gives as the average size, in cubic inches, of the\r\ncranial cavities of various nationalities, taking the results of many\r\nmeasurements: Lapps, 102; Swedes, 100; Anglo-Saxons, 96; Finns, 95;\r\nAnglo-Americans, 94; Germans, 92; Celts, 88; Malays, 86; Chinese, 85;\r\nTombs of Gizeh, 84; embalmed Semitic, 82; Egyptians, 80; Fellah, 79;\r\nBengalese, 78.\r\n\r\nA table of average brain weights of various nationalities,\r\ncompiled from Topinard's and Manouvrier's works and other standard\r\nanthropological publications, illustrates the same tendency toward\r\ngreater brain weights in colder countries. One of its results is to\r\nshow that the colder air of the United States produces larger brains\r\nin the negroes than the warm air of Africa. The table further shows,\r\nin the comparisons of Hindus and African negroes, that the brains are\r\nsmallest in the warmest countries, irrespective of race or nation;\r\nand that the largest average attained is in Scotland, where it is\r\nnever extremely warm.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of the cranial cavity is a very uncertain gauge of\r\nthe size of the brain, for the cerebro-spinal fluid may occupy a\r\nlarge share of the space. Weighing the brain is without doubt the\r\nonly scientifically certain method of determining its size and mass.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable case in the table of great men's\r\nbrains is that of Gambetta, who was behind none of his compeers in\r\nability, and yet had the smallest brain of all. The first table of\r\nthe \"Average Weight of the Human Body and Mind,\" compiled from Dr.\r\nBoyd's researches among the sane, which was based on more than two\r\nthousand post-mortem examinations, gives 45.9 ounces as the average\r\nbrain weight of boys from seven to fourteen years of age, and 40.2\r\nounces as that of boys and 40.1 ounces of girls from four to seven\r\nyears of age. And this little brain of 40.9 ounces appertained to\r\na man, \"a lofty, commanding, mental figure, standing out in bold\r\nrelief from the crowd of mediocrities which he dwarfs and shadows,\"\r\nthe embodiment of the French Republic, who steered it through one\r\nof its most perilous crises, \"the foremost Frenchman of his time,\"\r\nwho \"established his claim to be placed in the very front rank of\r\nEuropean statesmen,\" and whose untimely death was spoken of as\r\n\"nothing less than the sudden extinction of a powerful individual\r\nforce, one of the most powerful, indeed, of such forces hitherto\r\noperating in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the association of large brains with small minds,\r\nwe have compiled from various sources of recognized authority a list\r\nof one hundred and twenty-five persons of ordinary or weak minds,\r\nidiots, imbeciles, and criminals, whose brains were generally larger\r\nthan those of the distinguished men subjects of the preceding notes.\r\nOf these, Rustan, an ignorant and unknown workman, appears with a\r\nbrain weighing 78.3 ounces;[36] the dwarfed Indian squaw who follows\r\nhim, of 73.5 ounces;[37] an illiterate and weak-minded man had a\r\nbrain of 71.3 ounces;[38] and a congenitally imbecile person cited\r\nby Dr. Ireland, with one of 70.5 ounces.[39] Another imbecile cited\r\nby Dr. Ireland had a brain of 63.2 ounces, and the brain of an idiot\r\nwith a large head, eighteen years old, who had an idiotic sister,\r\nweighed 62.8 ounces. The brain of the idiot, No. 56 of the men in\r\nthe table, 59.5 ounces, is exceeded in size by those of only five\r\non the list of famous men, while eleven persons recorded as idiots,\r\nimbeciles, and children had brains heavier than his. An idiot boy\r\nof fourteen years, very malicious, who never spoke, and who nearly\r\nkilled his sister with a pick, had a brain weight of 57.5 ounces.\r\nThirty men out of three hundred and seventy-five examined in the West\r\nRiding Asylum gave brain weights of 55 ounces and upward, showing\r\nthat such weights are not so rare as some have supposed. In another\r\nasylum in England one out of every dozen brains examined showed a\r\nweight of 55 ounces or more.\r\n\r\nIn _Nachrichten_, of Göttingen, 1860, pp. 70-71, Dr. Rudolph Wagner\r\ngave a table of thirty-two persons whose brains he examined, among\r\nwhom were five distinguished men; but the largest brain weight\r\nrecorded in it, 55.9 ounces, has opposite to it the legend, \"Idiotic\r\ngrown man.\"\r\n\r\nTo this list we might have added a large number of persons whose\r\nbrains weighed less than 53 ounces. Yet the brains of Daniel Webster,\r\nAgassiz, Napoleon I, Lord Byron, Baron Dupuytren, General Skoboleff,\r\nand other famous men concerning whose large brains much has been\r\nsaid, weighed less than this; and we might have appended hundreds of\r\nbrain weights of idiots, imbeciles, and other insignificant persons,\r\nfrom 53 ounces down to 49 ounces--probably about the average weight\r\nin central Europe. In support of our contention is, further, an\r\nobservation by Dr. Rudolph Wagner in _Nachrichten_, February 29,\r\n1860, pp. 71, 72, that \"very intelligent men certainly do not differ\r\nstrikingly in brain weight from less gifted men.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Clendenning presents in the Croonian Lectures the following\r\nentries of brain weights of male subjects of different ages, the\r\ntendency of which is to show that the male encephalon loses, after it\r\nis grown, more than an ounce every ten years:\r\n\r\n  15 to  30 years      50.75 ounces.\r\n  30 to  50   \"        49.66    \"\r\n  50 to  70   \"        47.1     \"\r\n  70 to 100   \"        41.5     \"\r\n\r\nA number of other eminent anatomists have given similar evidence of\r\ndecrease in brain weight as intellectual power increases.\r\n\r\nThe \"Professor at the Breakfast Table,\" the late Dr. O. W. Holmes,\r\na learned man and experienced physician and professor of anatomy in\r\nHarvard University for thirty-five years, says: \"The walls of the\r\nhead are double, with a great chamber of air between them, over the\r\nsmallest and most crowded organs. Can you tell me how much money\r\nthere is in a safe, which also has thick walls, by kneading the\r\nknobs with your fingers? So, when a man fumbles about my forehead,\r\nand talks about the organs of individuality, size, etc., I trust him\r\nas much as I should if he felt over the outside of my strong box,\r\nand told me that there was a five-dollar or a ten-dollar bill under\r\nthis or that rivet. Perhaps there is, only he doesn't know anything\r\nabout it. We will add that, even if he knows the inward dimensions\r\nof the strong box, he could not thence determine the amount of cash\r\ndeposited in it.\"\r\n\r\nThe internal size of Spurzheim's skull was in cubic inches exactly\r\nthe same as that of the skull of Joachim, an imbecile six feet\r\nnine inches in height, with a brain weight of 61.2 ounces, whereas\r\nSpurzheim's brain weighed only 55 ounces.\r\n\r\nWhoever has examined heads in the dissecting room of a medical\r\ncollege knows that, except in rare cases of disease, the brain\r\ndoes not fit the skull, but is surrounded by three membranes and a\r\nwatery fluid; and this liquid, it has been ascertained, is generally\r\nsufficient to admit of its performing certain movements.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the brain moves in the skull, changing\r\nits position, according to the laws of gravitation, in much the\r\nsame way as the lungs, heart, and liver do in the body. It has been\r\nobserved many times to move, as well as to pulsate, when exposed to\r\nview during the life of the individual. It is subject to two regular\r\nand constant motions--one produced by the arteries, the other by\r\nrespiration. It has also a third motion, discovered and described\r\nby Dr. M. Luys, who stated, in a paper read before the Academy of\r\nMedicine of Paris, that \"the brain is subject to certain changes\r\nof position, dependent on the attitude of the body. Thus, if a man\r\nlies on his back or side, or stands on his head, the brain undergoes\r\ncertain changes of position in obedience to the laws of gravity; the\r\nmovements take place slowly, and the brain is five or six minutes in\r\nreturning to its previous position.\" From these anatomical data M.\r\nLuys deduced some interesting and practical conclusions, by which\r\nhe explained, for example, the symptoms of vertigo which feeble\r\npersons experience when suddenly rising from a horizontal position.\r\nHe suggested whether the pains of meningitis may not be due to an\r\ninterference with these normal movements, and urges the value of\r\ngiving the brain the change produced by a horizontal position at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe average cranial capacity is admitted to be 96 cubic inches in\r\nEngland and 94 in New York; and it is to the unusual quantity of\r\nfluid of some cases, and to the extraordinary thickness of the skull\r\nin others, that we are to attribute the frequent discrepancy between\r\nthe external dimensions and the size of the encephalon. Daniel\r\nWebster's cranial capacity was 122 cubic inches, yet his brain of\r\n53.5 ounces was just what George Combe has laid down as the average\r\nweight for an adult man. Water and lymph, we are told, filled the\r\nskull. Professor De Morgan's head, almost free from hair, measured\r\n24.87 inches in circumference, and the dimensions were all those of a\r\nvery large head, sufficient to contain from 65 to 70 ounces of brain,\r\nyet his brain weighed only 52.75 ounces, or little, if at all, above\r\nthe average in the cold parts of the temperate zones. De Morgan was\r\nsixty-five years of age when he died. He was much emaciated, and \"the\r\nbrain was distinctly shrunken,\" not filling the interior cavity,\r\nwhere its place was supplied, as is usual in such cases, by serum or\r\nwater. There is no known method whereby any man can determine whether\r\nbrain or water fills the greater part of any living skull. A small\r\norange may have a thin rind, and contain a good amount of eatable\r\nsubstance, while a large one may have so thick a skin that the fruit\r\nproves utterly disappointing.\r\n\r\nAnother proof that the skull is formed without regard to the brain\r\nis the following: \"The bony cabinet and its contents are developed,\r\nto a certain extent at least, independently. This is very clearly\r\ndemonstrated by a fact which was observed by Gratiolet, and is too\r\nfrequently forgotten. The subject is an infant in whom the cranium\r\npresented the normal conformation. The brain was, nevertheless,\r\nalmost entirely wanting.\"[40]\r\n\r\nDr. Gall was a poor arithmetician, and his biographer says that every\r\nkind of numerical calculation fatigued him. He could not go through\r\na process of multiplication or division that was at all complicated,\r\nand knew nothing of geometry or of the problems of mathematics.[41]\r\nGeorge Combe said of himself: \"Arithmetic has always been to me\r\na profound mystery, and to master the multiplication table an\r\ninsurmountable task.... This faculty in me is, in fact, idiotic.\"\r\nAgain he said: \"When a boy, I never could learn arithmetic. At the\r\nend of five years' teaching I could not subtract, divide, or multiply\r\nany considerable number of figures with accuracy and facility, and\r\ncan not now do so.... At the present day I can not sum a column of\r\nfigures correctly.\"[42]\r\n\r\nWith these facts in view, our wonder at finding the theories of\r\nthese men at variance with all exact calculation is considerably\r\ndiminished. We propose to test some of their theories by arithmetical\r\nprocesses. We found that the sixty famous men entered in the table of\r\nauthenticated brain weights show an average of 51.3 ounces. We now\r\ntake all the idiots and imbeciles in the table of \"Large Brains and\r\nSmall Minds,\" and find the average 59.4 ounces; so that the matter\r\nis left to stand thus: Ten idiots and five imbeciles average 59.2\r\nounces; sixty famous men average 51.39 ounces: in favor of idiocy and\r\nimbecility, 7.9 ounces.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest brain in the table of small minds is that of Rustan,\r\nan ignorant and entirely unknown laborer. He was a healthy man, and\r\nhis brain, when it was weighed, was in a healthy condition. Its\r\nweight was recorded by Dr. Carl A. Rudolphi, a Swedish naturalist\r\nand physiologist of Stockholm, who became professor of anatomy and\r\nphysiology at Berlin in 1810. It reached the unexampled figure of\r\n78.3 ounces; while the brain of Turgenieff, the heaviest among famous\r\nmen, was 71 ounces--showing a difference of 7.3 ounces in behalf of\r\nthe inferior mind.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above, the following appeared in Tit-Bits, a weekly\r\npaper published in London, England, March 19, 1898:\r\n\r\n\"It must not be assumed, however, that intellect is in direct\r\nratio to the weight of the brain; for while the brains of certain\r\nintellectual men, such as ... Dr. Abercromby, weighed more than 60\r\nounces, a certain Strand newspaper-boy, who was in intelligence\r\nalmost an idiot, had a brain which weighed no less than 80 ounces.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Austin Flint, of New York, in his Physiology, gives the average\r\nweight of the brains of men as 50.2 ounces. Dr. Peacock, of Great\r\nBritain, makes it 50 ounces 3 drachms between twenty-five and fifty\r\nyears of age. Dr. Thurman gives 49 ounces as the average throughout\r\nEurope, while Dr. F. Tiedemann, a famous naturalist of Germany,\r\nreckons it at 53.2 ounces.[43] Dr. Krause, a learned German, places\r\nit still higher, at 55.4 ounces.[44] Now, if we strike a balance\r\nbetween the highest and the lowest of these estimates, the mean will\r\nbe 52.2. Then, recalling the average of our sixty famous men, which\r\nwe found to be 51.3 ounces, it is shown to be nine tenths of an ounce\r\nbelow the average of ordinary men.\r\n\r\nOur tables of national average brain weights do not quite agree,\r\nbecause some of the subjects had been wasted by disease for many\r\nmonths before death, whereby the brain was diminished along with\r\nother parts of the body. Those who, like Dr. Boyd's subjects, died\r\nin hospital, showed too light an average for healthy Englishmen. Dr.\r\nKrause's subjects may have been healthy men killed in battle, and\r\nthose of Tiedemann persons who died suddenly. Executed criminals\r\nshow a fairly high average of brain weight, because there has been\r\nin their case no diminution through long-continued illness.[45] We\r\nshould recollect that Whewell, the famous English philosopher and\r\nhead master of Trinity College, Cambridge, England, was in good\r\nhealth when killed by a fall from his horse; so was Gambetta, when\r\nhis life was ended by a pistol shot. The brain, however, suffers\r\nless from the power of disease than the general bodily form. One\r\nmonth under the most wasting sickness would probably not diminish\r\nthe brain more than an ounce or two, but a year or more would make a\r\nconsiderable difference.\r\n\r\nTaking, now, the sixty heaviest brains of persons not noted for\r\nintellectual greatness, we find the averages to be 63.2 ounces.\r\nComparing this with the average of sixty famous men, 51.3 ounces,\r\nwe find a difference in favor of imbeciles, idiots, criminals, and\r\nmen of ordinary mind of 11.9 ounces. George Combe estimated that\r\nabout 53.5 ounces was the average weight of the adult brain. Thus\r\nthe average brain weight of all the eminent men whom we have brought\r\ninto the comparison, 51.3 ounces, is below Combe's estimate of that\r\nof mankind in general. Again, the ten heaviest brains of our list of\r\nfamous men give an average weight of 61.1 ounces, while the average\r\ngiven by the ten heaviest of the opposite class is 70.4 ounces, or\r\n9.3 ounces greater. While our list of eminent men shows only five\r\nwhose brains exceeded 58.6 ounces in weight, those of seventy-six of\r\nthe common throng--seven of them idiots or imbeciles--rise above that\r\nfigure. These figures augur badly for the doctrine that would attach\r\nimportance to heavy brains for giving force and depth of individual\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nPhrenologists assert that each organ of a mental faculty occupies\r\na certain position perceptible on the outside of the brain, with a\r\ndefinite area which they have mapped out. They also hold that each of\r\nthese organs extends to the center of the base of the brain, tapering\r\nto it somewhat like a cone, having its base turned toward the outer\r\nworld. They make no account of the fissures, the intervening sulci\r\nand anfractuosities that must cut many of these supposed cones, some\r\nat right and some at oblique angles. Then the large, long cavities or\r\nventricles intercept and would hinder many of them from reaching the\r\ncentral, basilar part of the brain. The anatomical structure of the\r\nbrain thus appears fatal to this theory of the organs.\r\n\r\nLarge and complicated convolutions of the brain with deep sulci have\r\nbeen regarded by some persons as inseparable from superior powers of\r\nmind. The supposition is erroneous and groundless. The rodents, such\r\nas beavers, squirrels, rats, mice, etc., have but little brain and no\r\nconvolutions whatsoever;[46] yet the beaver exhibits great foresight,\r\neconomy, industry, and mechanical skill in building his dam, erecting\r\nhis house, and storing up bark as food for the winter. Moreover,\r\nthese animals live in societies and labor in union by ingenious\r\nmethods for a common purpose, with nice judgment. \"So great a variety\r\nof labors,\" says Dr. Leuret, \"is needed for the constructions carried\r\non by the beaver; they include so many instances of well-made\r\nchoice, so many accidental difficulties are surmounted by these\r\nanimals, that it is impossible not to recognize in their actions\r\nthe characteristics of a rather high intelligence.\"[47] The sheep\r\nhas a much larger brain than the beaver, with numerous and complete\r\nconvolutions, yet it is one of the most stupid of domestic animals.\r\nAgain, though birds have convolutions in the cerebellum, they have\r\nnone in the cerebrum, and yet they are more capable of education than\r\nany living beings except the human race. The eagle is complete master\r\nof the lamb; the magpie, the hawk, the raven, and the parrot with his\r\ntalking powers, are not excelled in sagacity by the dog, the horse,\r\nor the elephant, notwithstanding the latter animals have brains of\r\nsuperior size and elaborate convolutions.\r\n\r\nSquirrels manifest foresight and economy in storing nuts for the\r\nwinter's use; yet they have no brain convolutions. The cetacea,\r\nespecially whales, have much larger brains than men, with more\r\nnumerous and more complex convolutions and deeper sulci; yet their\r\nintelligence bears no comparison with that of the human race.\r\n\r\nThree eminent men are known to have had very small convolutions of\r\nthe brain--viz., Louis Asseline, Dr. Tiedemann, and Baron von Liebig.\r\nWe have to add to this remarkable list two, not named, but described\r\nby Dr. Wagner as having been very intelligent, who yet possessed very\r\nfew convolutions in their very small brains.[48] As Wagner's book was\r\nprinted before Liebig died, he could not have been one of the two to\r\nwhom the author referred.\r\n\r\nIdiots often possess as large brains as men distinguished for\r\nintellectual power, and their brains have as deep sulci, and\r\nconvolutions as fine, as large, and as complex. Our table of the\r\ncommon and weak-minded contains a mention of an idiot whose brain\r\nweighed 53 ounces, or exactly as much as Napoleon's, and had fine\r\nconvolutions and a large frontal lobe, but who could never learn to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nThe elephant carries a far larger brain than man, finely formed,\r\nbroad and high in front, with much more numerous and complex\r\nconvolutions and deeper anfractuosities, and yet no intelligent\r\nperson would for a moment claim that its mind excels or even equals\r\nthat of man.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to allow some eminent physiologists to give their\r\nviews on this subject. \"The researches of anatomists have disposed of\r\nevery point advanced by Gall. Curiously enough, M. Camille Dareste\r\nhas placed beyond dispute the fact that the number and depth of\r\nthe convolutions bear no direct proportion to the development of\r\nintelligence, whereas they do bear a direct proportion to the size\r\nof the animal.... It is notorious that the instinct of propagation,\r\nthe instinct of destructiveness, the instinct of constructiveness,\r\nand other qualities are manifested by animals having no brains,\r\nnothing but simple ganglia.\"[49]\r\n\r\nDr. Bastian demonstrates the convolutional theory thus: \"In animals\r\nof the same group or order, the number and complexity of the\r\nconvolutions increase with the size of the animal.... There can not,\r\ntherefore, be among animals of the same order any simple or definite\r\nrelation between the degree of intelligence of the creature and the\r\nnumber or disposition of its cerebral convolutions.\"[50]\r\n\r\nWe have the following testimony in our favor from Dr. Rudolph Wagner,\r\nof Göttingen: \"Examples of highly complicated convolutions I have\r\nnever seen, even among eminent men whose brains I have examined....\r\nMany convolutions and great brain weight often go together. Higher\r\nintelligence appears in both kinds of brains, where there are many\r\nor where there are few convolutions. It is not proved that special\r\nmental gifts go with many convolutions.\"[51]\r\n\r\nAnother theory of mind is based on the gray matter of the brain,\r\nthe amount of which has been supposed to be proportionate to mental\r\ncapacity. As this gray matter, however, averages only about one fifth\r\nof an inch in thickness, it seems rather a thin foundation for the\r\nhuman intellect if the condition is good that \"size is a measure of\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. W. B. Carpenter stated the matter thus: \"The cortical\r\nsubstance or gray matter of the hemispheres essentially consists\r\nof that vesicular nerve substance which, in the spinal cord as in\r\nthe ganglionic masses generally, is found to occupy the interior.\r\nThe usual thickness is about one fifth of an inch; but considerable\r\nvariations present themselves in this respect, as also in the depth\r\nof the convolutions.\"[52]\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster's brain had gray substance to the depth only of\r\none sixteenth of an inch.[53] It thus appears that his brain had\r\na thinner layer of gray matter than the average of common-minded\r\nmen--one among the many proofs that facts are against all theories\r\nthat connect brain conditions with intellectual power.\r\n\r\nDr. Ireland thus describes an idiot boy who, though thirteen or\r\nfourteen years of age, was only three feet eight inches in height:\r\n\"In expression he was dull and inanimate, with an old face and a\r\nshort, squat figure.... The convolutions were broad and simple, but\r\nnot shallow. The gray matter was as broad as usual.\"[54]\r\n\r\nThe writer has examined many brains of persons morally or\r\nintellectually below the average--such as murderers, negroes, and\r\nothers sunk in ignorance. He has invariably found the layer of\r\nvesicular or gray matter to be thicker than that of Daniel Webster's\r\nbrain. Elephants, porpoises, whales, dolphins, and the grampus all\r\nhave this layer thicker than the most intellectual men. Another great\r\nobjection to locating mind in the gray matter of the brain is that\r\nthis substance is found in the interior part of the spinal cord, and\r\nin all the nerve centers throughout the body; so that, if mind is\r\nsituated in it, it is not confined to the brain, but dwells in the\r\nspine also, and is distributed all through the human frame. Still\r\nanother objection lies in the fact that wherever the gray matter\r\nexists near the surface of the brain, it consists of three distinct\r\nlayers, separated by a white substance, and the outermost layer is\r\nwhite, not gray.[55]\r\n\r\nThe _septum lucidum_ consists of gray matter. The _corpus striatum_,\r\nsituated at the base of the lateral ventricles, nearly in the center\r\nof the brain, was from three eighths to half an inch in diameter in\r\nan ox which was dissected in Edinburgh. This is about the same amount\r\nas is found in the _corpus striatum_ of the human brain. There would\r\nbe lively times if it were possible for a mental faculty to occupy at\r\nonce all the localities where gray matter is found!\r\n\r\nNone of the suppositions about certain qualities of mind inhering\r\nin particular portions of the brain have been proved, nor have they\r\nstood the tests of science.\r\n\r\nThe theories which have assumed that the cultivation of the intellect\r\ngives shape and size to the brain within and consequently to the\r\nskull without, advocates of which have not been wanting, have been\r\ndisproved by the collected facts. \"There is no proof,\" says Dr. J. C.\r\nNott, in his Types of Mankind, \"of the theory that the cultivation of\r\nthe mind or of one set of faculties can give expansion or increased\r\nsize of brain. The Teutonic races, in their barbarous state, two\r\nthousand years ago, possessed brains as large as now, and so with\r\nother races.\"\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis Globe Democrat of November 13, 1885, gives an account\r\nof some excavations on the Mount Ararat farm, east of Carrollton,\r\nIllinois, where the bones of thirty-two Indians or mound builders\r\nwere unearthed. \"They were not a diminutive race, as some people have\r\nsupposed, some of the thigh bones being sixteen inches long, and some\r\nof the skulls twenty-four inches in circumference.\" A skull having\r\na circumference of twenty-four inches means a head that measured\r\nfrom twenty-five to twenty-six and a half in life, when the cranium\r\nwas covered with skin and muscles. The average head of white men\r\nin New York to-day is only twenty-two and a half inches round. So\r\nthe culture of the white race for centuries has not developed their\r\nheads to near the size of those of the uncultured mound builders\r\nwho inhabited America many centuries ago. Our own opinion is that\r\ncultivation by means of a thorough classical education, where the\r\nappetite is restrained, as usually occurs, tends rather to diminish\r\nthe size of the head, by reducing the temporal muscles and the\r\nadipose tissue under the scalp.\r\n\r\nThe Engis skull is one of the most ancient known to exist, and\r\nbelonged to the stone age, or about the same time as the Neanderthal\r\nskull. Professor Huxley describes it as being well formed, and\r\nconsiderably larger than the average of European skulls to-day in the\r\nwidth and height of the forehead and in the cubic capacity of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nQuatrefages, in The Human Species, p. 312, says: \"This skull (the\r\nEngis or Cro-Magnon), so remarkable for its fine proportion, is also\r\nremarkable for its capacity. According to M. Broca, who could only\r\nwork under precautions calculated to diminish the amount, it is equal\r\nto at least 1,590 cubic centimetres (96.99 cubic inches). I have\r\nalready remarked that this number is far higher than the mean taken\r\nfrom modern Parisians; it is equally so in comparison with other\r\nEuropean nations.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts all conspire to prove that the cultivation of thousands\r\nof years has not increased the size of human skulls. In 1886, we\r\nmeasured many of the skulls unearthed at Pompeii, the remains of\r\nRomans who lived nearly two thousand years ago, and we found them on\r\nthe average larger in every way, but especially in the forehead, than\r\nthe skulls of Romans of this century.\r\n\r\nIn the museums of Switzerland we measured in 1887 several skulls of\r\nthe ancient lake dwellers of that country, and found them larger\r\nin all respects, but particularly in the forehead, than those of\r\nthe Swiss people of the last fifty years. The average circumference\r\nof the skulls we measured in the catacombs of Paris was twenty-one\r\ninches and a half, which is about an inch more than that of Parisians\r\nwho have died within the past fifty years.\r\n\r\n\"The average internal capacity of the Peruvian skull is only\r\nseventy-three cubic inches; that of Toltec skulls, seventy-seven\r\ninches, and that of barbarous tribes, eighty-two inches; so that the\r\nextraordinary anomaly is presented of a larger brain being possessed\r\nby the barbarous tribes than by the nations who achieved no mean\r\ndegree of civilization in Central America and Peru. The average\r\nEuropean skull is ninety-three inches in bulk.\"[56] The author was\r\ninformed by Mr. Lucien Carr, of the Ethnological Museum of Harvard\r\nUniversity, that the capacity of the Peruvian skulls was about one\r\nhundred centimetres smaller than that of the skulls of any other\r\npeople living in America at the same time. Yet that small-headed\r\npeople was the most highly civilized of all.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] Medical Times and Gazette, London, England, November 17, 1883.\r\n\r\n[33] Whewell also had \"the scalp and skull thick.\" Brain weighed 49\r\nounces.

E. A. MARTEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe not very graceful word _speleology_ was composed a few years ago\r\nby M. Émile Rivière out of Greek elements, as a translation of the\r\nGerman _Höhlenkunde_, to signify the study of caves. The study claims\r\na place among the sciences, and is, I believe, able to justify its\r\nclaim. Caves have been subjects of interest and curiosity in all\r\ntimes and countries. In the primitive ages, when palæolithic man was\r\nobliged to defend himself against the large Quaternary wild beasts,\r\nand did not yet know how to construct cabins, he lived in the most\r\ninaccessible caves, or those easiest to close, which he could find.\r\nAfterward, when man had advanced in civilization to the neolithic\r\nstage, and had somewhat improved tools and arms, having learned to\r\nbuild huts and villages, caves became simply burial places. In the\r\nhistorical periods of antiquity they were transformed into pagan\r\nsanctuaries or temporary hiding places in times of revolt, civil\r\nwar, or invasion. Down to the middle ages and the renascence, they\r\nshared this function with abandoned quarries. Through these changes\r\nthey gradually became objects of popular fear and absurd legend. I\r\nhave nearly everywhere in France found legendary and profound belief\r\nin some monstrous basilisk or dragon in the depths of dark caverns,\r\nguarding immense treasures; and woe to the rash adventurer who tried\r\nto steal these riches!\r\n\r\nIn short, caves have suffered their vicissitudes; their use as\r\nhabitations seems to be inversely proportioned to the degree of\r\ncivilization. The miserable aborigines of Australia have not yet\r\nquite abandoned them; and in France the present occupation of the\r\ngrottoes of Ezy, in the Eure, by some outcast families, who lead a\r\nsordid existence in them, indifferent to all social conventions,\r\nhas recently been cited as an extremely curious anthropological\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nScience, too, has laid its hold on caves only within a little more\r\nthan a century; for it was not till 1774 that Esper recognized that\r\nthe large bones taken from the caverns near Baireuth, in Bavaria,\r\nwere not those of human giants, but of extinct animals, and he\r\ncalled them, they being petrified by limestone, _zoöliths_, or\r\nanimal-stones; and it was his remarks upon them that drew Cuvier's\r\nattention to paleontology.\r\n\r\nThree sciences have of late years been advanced by the explorations\r\nof caves: paleontology; prehistory, or research among the remains\r\nof primitive men and their industries; and zoölogy, or the study\r\nof living beings. The animals of caverns--crustaceans, insects,\r\nbatrachians, and fishes--constitute a special fauna, which has been\r\nfor fifty years a subject of study to naturalists of various nations,\r\nand to the anatomy of which M. Armand Viré, of the Natural History\r\nMuseum of Paris, has been giving special attention for five years\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThere are other sciences the study of which in connection with\r\ncaves, while capable of yielding valuable fruits, has been too long\r\nneglected: geology, for their origin and formation; mineralogy, for\r\ntheir relations to metallic veins; meteorology, for thermometrical\r\nand barometrical variations and the formation of carbonic acid;\r\nterrestrial physics, for the experiments on gravity that might be\r\ncarried on in deep vertical pits, supplementing the observations\r\nof Foucault in the Pantheon at Paris, and Airy in the English\r\nmines; hydrology, which has hardly yet perceived that caves are\r\npredominantly great laboratories of springs; agriculture, which might\r\ntransform them into reservoirs for times of drought or storage basins\r\nin case of flood; and public hygiene, which is just beginning to\r\ndiscover that they may harbor in their fissures hitherto unsuspected\r\ncauses of contamination of the water of the springs that issue from\r\nthem. The number and importance of these new problems that have\r\narisen from the recent extension of underground investigations seem\r\nfully to justify the specialization of the science of caves--another\r\ncreation of the Speleological Society, now four years old. This\r\nspecial interest in the science of caves began about fifteen years\r\nago, when, in 1883, three members of the Austro-German Alpine\r\nClub--Herren Harske, Marinitsch, and Müller--resumed in the limestone\r\nplateaus of Istria and Carniola called the Karst, explorations which\r\nhad been actively and profitably carried on in the middle of the\r\ncentury, from 1850 to 1857, by Dr. Adolf Schmidt, whose discoveries\r\nin the caves of Adelsberg, Planina, and St. Canzion won him a\r\nmembership in the Vienna Academy of Sciences. Their efforts and those\r\nof Herr F. Kraus, who died last year, had the result of interesting\r\nthe Austrian Government in the subject; and since 1886 various\r\nengineers have been commissioned by the Minister of Agriculture to\r\nmake official explorations and construct economical works in the\r\ncaves and underground rivers of Istria, Carniola, and Herzegovina.\r\nCredits are granted every year for enterprises which prove to be more\r\nuseful than would at first be thought.\r\n\r\nIt was at the same time, between 1883 and 1885, that I made my first\r\ninvestigation in the Causses of Lozère, Aveyron, and the adjoining\r\ndepartments of France, the results of which were to reveal for the\r\nfirst time to the public, and even to geographers, the picturesque\r\nbeauties, then unknown, and now becoming the fashion, of the gorges\r\nof the Tarn, Jenta, and Dourbie, the rocks of Montpelier le Vieux,\r\netc. In my excursions over the plateaus of the Causses I frequently\r\nmet, at the level of the surface, open, dark holes, and mouths of\r\nvertical wells--_avens_--the depths of which no one had ever looked\r\ninto, unsoundable, they said, which the peasants naturally took to be\r\nreal mouths of hell. Recollecting what I had admired at Adelsberg and\r\nin various caves of the Pyrenees, I guessed these avens might also\r\nbe doorways to subterranean splendors and scientific treasures. So I\r\nbegan in 1888 the methodical exploration of the unexamined natural\r\ncavities of my own land first, and then of other countries of Europe;\r\nand since then I have devoted several weeks every year to this work.\r\n\r\nThese pits are simply horizontal holes opening upon the surface of\r\nthe ground, of very different forms and dimensions. Herdsmen are very\r\ncareful not to let their cattle go too near them, for they sometimes\r\nfall in.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of these pits varies from a few inches to several\r\nhundred yards, and they are sometimes more than six hundred feet\r\ndeep. It is not easy to go down into them, especially when they are\r\non high levels away from habitations and roads. In such cases a\r\nconsiderable apparatus of ropes, rope ladders, telephone, portable\r\nboat, tent, etc., has to be taken along. The first measurement with\r\nthe sounding line gives the depth only of the first pit--and there\r\nare often several succeeding one another. A rope ladder long enough\r\nto reach the bottom is then let down, and the man who descends has\r\na rope tied about him for additional security, which is held by the\r\npeople above. A great many pits are narrower at the top than lower\r\ndown, forming something like a reversed speaking trumpet, so that\r\nthe explorer finds it very difficult to make himself heard at the\r\ntop; hence I have adopted the practice of taking a telephone along.\r\nThe interior shapes of the pits are very diverse. The narrower ones\r\nare easiest to go down, because they permit one partly to support\r\nhimself against their walls. The wider ones leave him hanging loose,\r\nin a position which he feels to be very precarious. When there is a\r\nsecond or third pit, and we have not ladders enough, we have to trust\r\nourselves to a simple rope with a board fastened at the end of it\r\nfor a seat. The _gouffre_ of Vigne Close, in Ardèche, which is about\r\nsix hundred feet deep, has five successive pits, and its complete\r\nexploration required three days. The bottom of the pit may be a\r\nsimple cleft in the rock, or an immense cathedral-like chamber; as at\r\nRabanel, near Ganges, and Hérault, the deepest abyss in France, the\r\nvault of which expands into a gigantic nave, five hundred feet high,\r\nwhich is lighted by the beam of light that falls through the opening,\r\npresenting a grand and indescribable spectacle. Some pits of less\r\ndepth, as the Tin doul de la Vayssière, in Aveyron, and the Padirac\r\nwell, in Lot, both leading to underground rivers, enjoy a still more\r\ncomplete illumination. Considerable talus banks close the ends of\r\nthese broad pits, and are generally produced by the caving in of the\r\nroofs of caves.\r\n\r\nLively controversies and gross errors have prevailed concerning the\r\ngeological formation of abysses. The abyss of Jean Nouveau, Vaucluse,\r\namong others, furnishes evidence against the false hypothesis that\r\nsuch pits are as a rule the results of cave-ins, whereas pits of that\r\norigin are rare and exceptional. These pits are for the most part\r\nfissures, the principal feature of which is their narrowness. At Jean\r\nNouveau the greatest breadth is not more than about sixteen feet. It\r\nis the deepest vertical pit of a single shaft without intermediate\r\nterraces that we know of, and is about five hundred and thirty feet\r\nfrom the surface of the ground to its floor. The mass of stone\r\nrubbish at the bottom prevented our descending into a second pit.\r\n\r\nPits composed, like Vigne Close, of several successive wells, destroy\r\nanother hypothesis--that of the formation of _gouffres_ by the\r\nemissions from thermal springs.\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger in descending these pits arises from the showers\r\nof stones that sometimes come down upon the head of the explorer.\r\nThese are often started by his friends the hunters, or by their dogs\r\ngamboling around at will.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the caverns I have explored were stopped up by\r\nobstacles of one kind or another that prevented further progress, in\r\nothers we found considerable rivers running a nearly free course. We\r\nrarely found pits formed by the collapse of the roofs of the cave in\r\ncases where the distance from the subterranean river which by its\r\nwork of erosion provoked the catastrophe to the surface was more\r\nthan one hundred metres. The pit of the Mas Raynal, Aveyron, is one\r\nhundred and six metres deep, and abuts upon a large subterranean\r\nriver, which supplies the Sorgues of Saint-Affrique, one of the\r\nfinest springs of France. When we explored it, in 1889, we could not\r\npass the low chambers which occur in it because the water was too\r\nhigh, and we have not visited it since. Its exploration in a dry\r\nseason might reveal many very interesting chambers.\r\n\r\nIn the cave of Rabanel, the first well, which ends in a talus of\r\nfallen stones, furnishes an instance of a vertical fissure grafted,\r\nif we may use the word, upon an interior grotto that already existed.\r\nA stream runs through this grotto which falls into a second well\r\ntwenty-six metres, and is then lost in smaller passages so nearly\r\nstopped up with earth that we were not able to follow it through its\r\ncourse of about a mile till it comes out at the Brissac spring.\r\n\r\nThe cave of Trebiciano, in Istria, near Trieste, the deepest known,\r\nhas a total depth of more than a thousand feet. It is not, however,\r\nentirely natural, but is composed of numerous vertical fissures which\r\nlead, at about eight hundred and fifty feet below the surface, to a\r\nlarge cavern, at the bottom of which flows the subterranean river\r\nRecca. The fissures do not naturally communicate directly with one\r\nanother, but the engineer Lindner was commissioned in 1840-'41 by the\r\ncity of Trieste to construct for the municipality a supply of potable\r\nwater from the underground streams, and after eleven months of labor\r\nmade artificial connections between the different parts of the chasm.\r\n\r\nThese vertical pits are formed by the wearing down, from the top,\r\nby the waters which become ingulfed in them. This mode of their\r\nformation was demonstrated to me in 1895, when I was in Great Britain\r\nunder a commission from the French Minister of Instruction. I then\r\nexplored several caves in which the rivers were still running, and\r\nsatisfied myself that the pits were simply absorbing wells. Such\r\nwells are not effective now in southern France and Austria, but\r\nin northern Europe, where rain is more abundant, they are still\r\noperative. I found the plainest evidence of this fact in Yorkshire,\r\nat the Gaping Ghyll, Ingleborough, where a river precipitates itself\r\nat one leap one hundred metres under the earth. English investigators\r\nand travelers had tried without success to descend into it in\r\n1845, 1870, and 1894, having conquered only about one hundred and\r\nninety-five feet of its total depth of two hundred and twenty-nine\r\nfeet. It took me twenty-five minutes to go down upon a rope ladder\r\nwhich was suspended in the midst of the cascade. Fortunately, the\r\npit had the daylight to the very bottom--a wonderful spectacle,\r\ncompensating me for all my trouble and the long douche bath which\r\ngreeted me at the end of the descent, where stretched an immense\r\nRoman nave nearly five hundred feet long, eighty feet wide, and\r\nninety feet high, without any sustaining pillar. From the middle of\r\nthe roof of this colossal cavern fell the cascade in a great nimbus\r\nof vapor and light--a wonderful fantastic scene, such as Gustave\r\nDoré or Jules Verne could never have imagined. The most pleasant\r\nfeature of the whole of it, however, to me was the thought that I had\r\nsucceeded where the English had failed, and on their own ground. The\r\npeople were nevertheless very pleasant to me, and at my instance have\r\ncontinued the exploration and made some new discoveries.--_Translated\r\nfor the Popular Science Monthly from the Revue Scientifique._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[57] From an address before the Société des Amis des Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF CHARLES HENRY HITCHCOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Prof. Charles H. Hitchcock is closely associated with the\r\nprogress of New England geology, especially with the discovery of the\r\ngreat terminal glacial moraine, and, in connection with the name of\r\nhis father, Dr. Edward Hitchcock, with the study of the fossil bird\r\ntracks of the Connecticut River Valley.\r\n\r\nCHARLES HENRY HITCHCOCK was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, August\r\n23, 1836, the son of Prof. Edward Hitchcock, the eminent geologist,\r\nwho was afterward president of Amherst College. The family is of\r\nEnglish origin, and was planted in America by two brothers who came\r\nover at nearly the same time and made homes for themselves in New\r\nHaven, removing later to towns near by. Luke Hitchcock, the ancestor\r\nof the subject of this sketch, came in 1695, and finally settled at\r\nWethersfield, Connecticut. His descendants in the direct line lived\r\nat Springfield, Granville, Deerfield, and Amherst, Massachusetts.\r\nProfessor Hitchcock is in the seventh generation from Luke, and is\r\nequally removed from Elder John White, his maternal ancestor, who\r\ncame to Canton, Massachusetts, toward the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and removed thence to the Connecticut Valley. Both lines of\r\nancestry were purely English, and all the progenitors were men of\r\nintegrity, regarded in their times as worthy to fill offices of trust\r\nin church and town. Two of them served in the Revolutionary army.\r\n\r\nThe father of Professor Hitchcock was one of the most distinguished\r\ngeologists and educators of his time, and his services, especially\r\nas State Geologist of Massachusetts, have already been described\r\nin the Popular Science Monthly.[58] His mother was the daughter\r\nof Jacob White, a well-to-do farmer of Amherst, who, believing in\r\nthe education of women, had given her the best opportunities for\r\nstudy available at the time. She could read the Greek Testament and\r\ncalculate eclipses, and was a gifted artist with pencil and brush.\r\nShe prepared with her own hands many of the numerous illustrations in\r\nher husband's reports, and also diagrams for the lecture room. She\r\ntook indefatigable pains with the education of her children, placing\r\ntheir moral and religious welfare first. Of the eight children of\r\nthe family, six of whom reached maturity, the surviving brother\r\nis professor of physical culture, and, for the time being, acting\r\npresident at Amherst College, and one of the two surviving sisters,\r\nthe widow of the Rev. C. M. Terry, has been for several years matron\r\nof the Hubbard Cottage, Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBeginning with 1835, the year before Professor Hitchcock was born,\r\nhis father, Professor Edward Hitchcock, was largely occupied with\r\nthe study of the \"fossil bird tracks\" in the New Red Sandstone\r\nof the Connecticut Valley, and with the discussions to which the\r\ninvestigation gave rise, the story of which has been told by Prof.\r\nC. H. Hitchcock himself in the Popular Science Monthly (vol.\r\niii, August, 1873). Besides the search for the fossils and their\r\ncollection and comparison, and the examination of the literature\r\nthat might throw light on the subject, there were studies into the\r\nproper interpretation of the early chapters of Genesis, the debate\r\nwith Prof. Moses Stewart, of Andover, and the gradual approach of the\r\nAmerican clergy to general acquiescence in the belief that geology is\r\nnot at variance with Scripture. Professor Hitchcock's childhood was\r\nlargely spent under the influence of these studies and discussions.\r\nThe boy seemed to be full of promise, and because of his observing\r\nways and proneness to speculation was called \"the young philosopher.\"\r\nHe used to bring his mother the very small flowers of _Spergula\r\nrubra_, which are so obscure that older eyes often fail to notice\r\nthem. He seemed to be fonder of his father than the other children,\r\nand was never so happy as with him. Through this constant intercourse\r\nCharles became absorbed in his father's pursuits, and grew up into\r\na knowledge of geology from Nature and from verbal explanations--a\r\nmore satisfactory method than that of learning from books; and he\r\nwas associated with his father in all his geological work from the\r\ntime when he was first old enough to be of service. Thus, before\r\n1856 he was acquainted, from inspection, with the terraces and\r\nreputed beaches and drift phenomena of all western Massachusetts; he\r\nhad handled every specimen of a foot mark in the Appleton Cabinet,\r\nand by 1861 was the principal assistant on the Vermont Survey,\r\nhaving prepared for the press the greater part of the matter of the\r\nreport. He had enjoyed the best educational advantages of his day,\r\nhaving completed the classical and preparatory courses of Williston\r\nSeminary, and been graduated thence in 1852, then graduated from\r\nAmherst College in 1856, a short time before his twentieth birthday.\r\nAmong his early classmates and college friends were Dr. Cyrus\r\nNorthrup, president of Minnesota University; Dr. Richard Mather,\r\nprofessor of Greek at Amherst College; the Rev. Dr. Goodwin, of\r\nChicago; and Dr. William Hayes Ward, editor of The Independent. After\r\ngraduation he spent a year in special study of Hebrew and chemistry\r\nat Yale College, two years at Andover Theological Seminary, and one\r\nyear in Europe, studying in the Royal School of Mines under Professor\r\nHuxley, and in the British Museum investigating the crustacea and\r\ntrilobites. Here he enjoyed the friendship of Professor Richard Owen,\r\nand had the guidance of Dr. H. Woodward.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Mr. Hitchcock was appointed assistant geologist to the\r\nGeological Survey of Vermont. He served the full term of the survey,\r\nand had charge of the preparation of the report relating to the\r\nstratigraphical geology, the measurement and delineation of the\r\nsections, and the compilation of the geological map.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 he received the appointment of State Geologist of Maine,\r\nin which service he spent two summers in field work, preparing two\r\nreports of progress, which were published in connection with the\r\nreport of the secretary of the Board of Agriculture. Besides the\r\ngeneral reconnoissance, he discovered the existence of large areas of\r\nUpper Silurian and Devonian terranes. He has embodied his views of\r\nthe distribution of the formations in his general map of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nHaving chosen the ministry for his profession, Mr. Hitchcock studied\r\ntheology under Dr. E. A. Park, of Andover, and the Rev. Dr. Taylor,\r\nof New Haven. Questions of the relations of theology and science\r\nwere attracting much attention, and he treated of them in two papers\r\nin the _Bibliotheca Sacra_, one of which was afterward used for the\r\nguidance of theological students in several seminaries. As more\r\nopportunities were offered for scientific work, the ministry was\r\ngiven up. This was the time when the doctrine of natural selection\r\ncame to the front for investigation, and the early history of mankind\r\nwas receiving increased attention. Mr. Hitchcock came home from\r\nEurope in 1867 convinced of the truth of some form of evolution, of\r\na considerable antiquity of man, and of the probability of a plural\r\norigin of the human race. Finding that some of his views on these\r\nsubjects were not acceptable to his associates, he ceased to make\r\nthem prominent in his class instructions, and devoted his attention\r\nto the more technical details of geology. Since then general opinion\r\nhas advanced so far on these subjects that the views he held at that\r\ntime seem now really conservative.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 he was appointed State Geologist for New Hampshire, and\r\nspent ten years in the survey of that State. The results of his\r\nwork there were published in three large quarto volumes, with a\r\nfolio atlas of maps, profiles, and sections. The rocks described\r\nconsist principally of crystalline schists and marine igneous\r\nejections. The geology of New Hampshire is of peculiar importance,\r\nbecause the situation of the State is such that a correct knowledge\r\nof its rocks promotes the understanding of many obscure terranes in\r\nthe adjacent regions of Maine, Quebec, Vermont, and Massachusetts.\r\nProfessor Hitchcock's report of the survey may justly be styled his\r\nchief work. The part best studied relates to the White Mountains\r\nand the Ammonoosuc mining district. Connected with the survey was\r\nthe maintenance of a meteorological station throughout the year on\r\nthe summit of Mount Washington. Daily statements of the weather\r\nconditions of this station during the winter of 1870-'71 were sent\r\nby telegraph to the principal newspapers, and called out much\r\ninterest--before the United States Signal Service began its weather\r\npredictions.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of Professor Hitchcock's publications comprises more\r\nthan one hundred and fifty titles of papers, reports, and books.\r\nPerhaps the earliest thorough study represented among them was that\r\nof the fossil footmarks. The first of the published papers on this\r\nsubject related to the tracks of animals in alluvial clay, and was\r\npublished in the American Journal of Science in 1855. For several\r\nyears after this he assisted his father in arranging the museum and\r\ncompiling tables for the Ichnology. He made a complete catalogue\r\ndescriptive of the more than twenty thousand individual impressions\r\npreserved in the Appleton Cabinet, which was printed, with\r\ndescriptions of a few new species of footmarks, in the Supplement\r\nto the Ichnology of Massachusetts, edited by him after the death of\r\nhis father in 1865. Although circumstances have prevented him from\r\npaying much attention to ichnology in later years, he has prepared\r\nseveral papers on the subject, the most important of which was one on\r\nthe Recent Progress of Ichnology, which was read before the Boston\r\nSociety of Natural History about twelve years ago. In it the ichnites\r\nwere carefully catalogued anew and classified in the light of our\r\nknowledge of the numerous dinosaurs of the West; and the results\r\nof some studies of the slabs exhumed at Wethersfield, Connecticut,\r\nare well known. The list of the Connecticut footmarks was increased\r\nfrom one hundred and nineteen in the Ichnology to one hundred and\r\nseventy; and facts were cited to show that the _Grallator_, the\r\nthree-toed animal most allied to birds, possessed a caudal appendage\r\nof a reptilian nature. The Trias of New Jersey had been found to\r\nillustrate new features in the _Otozoum_, whose tracks are often\r\nornithic in aspect. A comparison of the features of the Triassic\r\nskeletons described by Marsh from Connecticut (_Anchisaurus_) shows\r\nthat the creatures were rather allied to the _Plesiornis_ than to\r\nthe _Anomoepus_ of the Ichnology, because of the great size of\r\nthe fore feet. Notes upon footmarks have been gathered also from\r\nillustrations in Pennsylvania, Nova Scotia, Kansas, Nevada, and\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hitchcock has studied the Quaternary or glacial deposits\r\nwith great success. His first publication upon the terraces and\r\nallied phenomena of Vermont appeared while the old views of a\r\nsubmergence, with icebergs, prevailed, to account for the phenomena.\r\nA study of the glaciers of Switzerland in 1866 satisfied him of the\r\ntruth of Agassiz's theory; and whenever the opportunity came for\r\nre-examination of the surface geology of northern New England, the\r\nfacts were found to require a different theoretical explanation. He\r\ncaused a thorough examination to be made of the Connecticut River\r\nterranes by Warren Upham in the New Hampshire Survey, and proved\r\nthat all the high mountains of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine\r\nhad been glaciated by a southeasterly movement. The ice came from\r\nthe Laurentian highlands, pushed in a southern direction down the\r\nChamplain-Hudson Valley, with a southeasterly flow over New England\r\nand southwesterly over the Adirondacks; the last two courses having\r\nbeen subordinate to the first. At present the Laurentian hills are\r\nlower than the New England and New York mountains overridden by the\r\nice, and probably the same was the case in the Glacial period. The\r\nbest explanation of these paths is afforded by the suggestion that a\r\ngigantic ice cap accumulated north of the St. Lawrence, towering into\r\nthe clouds so much that its overflow naturally descended over the\r\nWhite and Adirondack Mountains.\r\n\r\nThat glaciers should accumulate terminal moraines is axiomatic, but\r\nno geologist before 1868 had ventured to suggest where moraines\r\nmight be located in the United States. In that year Professor\r\nHitchcock delivered a lecture before the Lyceum of Natural History\r\nin New York and the Long Island Historical Society in Brooklyn, in\r\nwhich he affirmed that the drift deposits from Prospect Park along\r\nthe backbone of Long Island for its entire length constituted the\r\nterminal moraine of the great continental ice sheet. This declaration\r\ninaugurated a new era in the study of the age of ice. The geologists\r\nin their several States found the terminal moraines, and the various\r\nphenomena began to be classified according to new laws. The search\r\nfor moraines has resulted in a restatement of the incident of the\r\nage of ice; more than a dozen successive terminal moraines have\r\nbeen mapped between New York and Montana, which suggest to us the\r\nexistence of several glacial periods. In compiling a catalogue of\r\nobservations of the course of glacial striæ by the United States\r\nGeological Survey, it was found that Professor Hitchcock had recorded\r\nfor New England as many as all other geologists had observed for the\r\nwhole country.\r\n\r\n_Eskers_ are another interesting class of phenomena, and were first\r\ndescribed as _horsebacks_ in Maine, about seventy of them having been\r\ndescribed in the report of 1861 and 1862. It was not till after the\r\ndescription of the Swedish Ösar that the nature of these lines or\r\nridges was understood; and now they were found in every prominent\r\nvalley in New England, as attendant upon the recession of the ice\r\nsheet. Professor Hitchcock gave the correct name of these ridges in\r\nhis Elementary Geology, 1860; while for many years subsequently they\r\nwere erroneously called _kames_, even in the geology of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hitchcock gave the name of Champlain to the fossiliferous\r\nclays associated with the till of the Atlantic coast. The term has\r\ncome into general use as connected with the melting of the ice in the\r\nlatter part of the period. Because of the presence of boreal species,\r\nand of analogies with similar deposits in Europe, Professor Hitchcock\r\nhas asked the question whether there may not have been a Champlain\r\nglacial epoch posterior to those named farther in the interior of the\r\ncountry, the Kansan, Iowan, and Illinoisian epochs.\r\n\r\nThose who explore the geology of northern New England have to deal\r\nwith crystalline rocks of various ages, and the opinions of our best\r\ngeologists have not been in agreement respecting them. Professor\r\nHitchcock was the first to make a geological map of New Hampshire,\r\nand he also demonstrated the anticlinal nature of the Green Mountains\r\nof Vermont. His teachers had inculcated the view that these eminences\r\nbelonged to a synclinal disposition, coupling this with theoretical\r\nassertions as to their age and metamorphism. Finding their main\r\nprinciple to be erroneous, he naturally disparaged their theories,\r\nthough more recent studies are eliminating many of the schists from\r\nthe Archæan. All the later explorers in the field--Canadians and\r\nmembers of the Geological Survey--accept a pre-Cambrian anticlinal in\r\nthe heart of the Green Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the New Hampshire formations was made out for\r\nthe most part before any assistance was derived from the labors\r\nof Dr. G. W. Hawes and other petrographers. Twenty years ago, at\r\nthe date of the final publication of the New Hampshire maps, the\r\ndoctrine of an igneous origin of the crystalline schist had hardly\r\nbeen hinted at. What seems elemental to the modern petrographer who\r\nhas acquired his technical education since 1890 was unknown then,\r\nand the classification given in the report may not agree with that\r\nnow taught. In the midst of the diverse views entertained, Professor\r\nHitchcock classified the rocks of northern New England according\r\nto this principle: rocks that are identical in petrographical\r\ncomposition are assumed to have had the same origin, and to be\r\nsynchronous. Professor Hitchcock was almost the first of American\r\ngeologists to employ the petrographer as a help to the understanding\r\nof the crystallines--as was evident by the very valuable\r\ncontributions to knowledge in Part IV of the New Hampshire Report as\r\nprepared by Dr. Hawes.\r\n\r\nA vexing question concerning what are now called Cambrian terranes\r\ndivided geologists for a quarter of a century after 1857, and had to\r\nbe considered in preparing the geology of Vermont in 1861. This was\r\nthe Taconic controversy. Trilobites had been discovered in Vermont,\r\nwhich were misunderstood by most of the American geologists following\r\nHall, Logan, Dana, and others. In giving the species the technical\r\nname first of _Barrandesi_ and then _Olenellus_, Prof. James Hall\r\nasserted its derivation from the Hudson River group--relying upon\r\nthe stratigraphical determinations of Sir W. E. Logan. As soon\r\nas Barrandes's attention was called to these trilobites and the\r\nattendant publication, he wrote his famous letter to Logan in 1860,\r\ndeclaring that there must be a mistake somewhere. That error was\r\ndiscovered in time to be eliminated from the Vermont report of the\r\nfollowing year. Professor Hitchcock had charge of the field work\r\nin this Cambrian district, and his views of the arrangement of the\r\nformations are in agreement with those of the latest workers in\r\nthe field. He applied the term of _Georgia_ to one division of the\r\nterrane in 1860; and the designation has been generally adopted\r\nsince that time. Jules Marcou claimed priority in the suggestion of\r\nthe application of the term, but upon the publication of Professor\r\nHitchcock's statement on the subject the credit of priority was\r\nawarded to him by Director Walcott, of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey.\r\n\r\nBetween 1860 and 1870 Professor Hitchcock was occupied largely as a\r\nmining geologist in the estimation of mineral deposits for mining\r\ncompanies, with his office in New York. In the prosecution of this\r\nbusiness he traveled in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Maine,\r\nNew Hampshire, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, Ohio, Kentucky, and Alabama. Subsequently, the study of the\r\nphosphate beds led him to the island of Redonda in the West Indies.\r\nHe further visited the phosphate beds of South Carolina and Florida,\r\nthe gold fields of eastern Oregon, the Chalcedony Park of Arizona,\r\nthe Grand Cañon of the Colorado, and the Yosemite and Yellowstone\r\nParks. Studies made in the Hawaiian Islands and their volcanoes in\r\n1883 and 1886 resulted in the contribution of important observations\r\nrespecting those regions. At the present writing Professor Hitchcock\r\nis spending a year of further observations in those islands.\r\n\r\nMr. Hitchcock was appointed, in 1858, lecturer in zoölogy and curator\r\nof the cabinet in Amherst College; an office which he filled for\r\nseven years, retiring after the death of his father. In 1866 he\r\nwas elected professor of geology in Lafayette College, where he\r\ngave short courses of instruction to five successive classes. In\r\n1868 he was called to the chair of geology in Dartmouth College,\r\na position which he still occupies, receiving a year's leave of\r\nabsence for 1898-'99 in consideration of thirty years of service. He\r\ntaught geology and zoölogy as a provisional professor at Williams\r\nCollege in 1881, and in the following year in the Virginia College of\r\nAgriculture and the Mechanic Arts, Blacksbury. He received the degree\r\nof M. A. in course at Amherst in 1859, the honorary degree of Ph.\r\nD. from Lafayette College in 1870, and that of LL. D. from Amherst\r\nCollege in 1896.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hitchcock has been connected with the American Association\r\nfor the Advancement of Science since 1856, and a nearly constant\r\nattendant upon its meetings and participant in the proceedings.\r\nHe is a member of local scientific societies in Portland, Me.,\r\nBoston, Mass., New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis, and also of\r\nthe Imperial Geological Institute of Vienna. He was one of the most\r\nprominent movers in the inception and early history of the Geological\r\nSociety of America, and had much to do with the organization of the\r\nInternational Congress of Geologists, and with the preparation of\r\nspecial reports for the several meetings between 1876 and 1890. The\r\nhandsome geological map of small scale compiled for the United States\r\nwas prepared by him and published in the Transactions of the American\r\nInstitute of Mining Engineers (1887), to illustrate the nomenclature\r\nand color scheme of the International Congress.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hitchcock is best known to many by his geological maps. The\r\nfirst efforts at mapping the geology of the United States were made\r\nindependently by Edward Hitchcock and Jules Marcou in 1883--the work\r\nof Mr. Marcou extending only to the plains. Prof. H. D. Rogers, five\r\nor six years later, prepared a map for Johnston's Physical Atlas.\r\nIn 1872 Prof. C. H. Hitchcock and Prof. W. P. Blake compiled a map\r\nfor the ninth census of the United States, and for R. W. Raymond's\r\nreport upon the mineral resources of the country. The success of his\r\nsmall scale map led Professor Hitchcock to undertake the preparation\r\nof a map on a scale of twenty-five miles to the inch for the whole\r\ncountry. For this he consulted every work that had been printed\r\nupon the geology of the United States, and obtained the privilege\r\nof using many unpublished data collected by geologists of States\r\nand Territories in which the work had never been carried to actual\r\ncompletion. The map prepared by the General Land Office was used\r\nas the basis for the geological coloration, and the work appeared\r\nin 1881, of a size adapted to use in the classroom. Its compiler\r\nhas never seen any criticism of its accuracy. The edition prepared\r\nfor the Mining Institute embodies all the information acquired for\r\nthe large map, with such additional facts as had been learned since\r\nthat map was published. Prof. Hitchcock's services were called into\r\nrequisition in the compilation of a similar map for the United\r\nStates Geological Survey, which was published in its annual report\r\nfor 1886, under the editorship of W. J. McGee; in fact, the two maps\r\nwere printed from the same plates, but Dr. Hitchcock's contained\r\ncertain features not found in the other one--the result of different\r\ninterpretations--and was more complete. In the Government edition\r\na system of coloration devised by Major J. W. Powell, which was\r\nafterward abandoned, was employed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hitchcock contributed extensively to the collection of\r\nState geological maps in the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, when\r\nlarge scale sheets of New England, and a large copy of the Hitchcock\r\nand Blake map of 1872, were exhibited. A medal was awarded for a\r\nsheet of thirteen sections illustrating the stratigraphy of Vermont\r\nand New Hampshire. The beginning of the measurement of sections was\r\nmade for the Vermont Geological Report under the direction of Dr.\r\nEdward Hitchcock in 1861. Twelve lines of exploration across the\r\nentire State were determined upon, and specimens were collected to\r\nillustrate all the varieties of rock seen upon each. The specimens\r\nwere arranged in the State Museum at Montpelier in geographical\r\norder. A similar plan of collection and arrangement was projected\r\nfor the New Hampshire survey, but it was made to extend across the\r\ntwo States, from Maine to New York. Besides the two State reports,\r\nlater publications were issued, descriptive of explorations and\r\ncollections for the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory in New York, and the New Hampshire Agricultural Report for\r\n1883. The work did not cease with these publications, for after\r\nthe transfer of the collection of sections from the New Hampshire\r\nCollege of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts to Dartmouth College in\r\n1894, additional explorations were made; the number of sections was\r\nincreased to eighteen; improved drawings of the profiles, colored\r\ngeologically, were prepared for the cases in the new Butterfield\r\nMuseum; and the explanation of the details was further facilitated by\r\nthe construction of a large relief map on the scale of one mile to\r\nthe inch horizontally, twice as much vertically, and having colors\r\ncorresponding to those on the profiles between the shelves. About\r\nfive thousand specimens have been gathered to illustrate the profiles.\r\n\r\nThe Dartmouth College Museum is filled with specimens accumulated\r\nby the energy of Professor Hitchcock. They concern geology,\r\npaleontology, petrography, economic botany, and conchology.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[58] Vol. xlvii, September, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor's Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_EVOLUTION AND EDUCATION._\r\n\r\nOur attention has been drawn to a lively discussion that has lately\r\ntaken place in the St. Paul papers over the utterances, on the\r\nsubject of the doctrine of evolution in its relation to education, of\r\na certain Mr. Smith, who was appointed not long since superintendent\r\nof the public schools of that city. What seems clear is that Mr.\r\nSmith is a very ignorant man, whose views in regard to education are\r\nof an altogether retrograde character. How he came to be appointed to\r\nhis present position is a question which is being gravely pondered by\r\nmany of the citizens; but probably the explanation is not very far\r\nto seek. The dispensers of patronage in State and municipal affairs\r\nare not always competent to make the best nominations to offices\r\ncalling for high qualifications; and sometimes they do not even act\r\nup to their own indifferent lights. The man that has the pull is very\r\napt to be the man that gets the office, and it is not often that the\r\nstrongest pull goes with the highest professional fitness.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, there Mr. Smith is, and what kind of a man he\r\nis may be judged from his utterances. It is thus that he refers to\r\nMr. Spencer: \"There is an old man in England who for years has spent\r\nall his time and devoted all his energies to the attempt to create\r\na system which shall entirely ignore the name of the Deity. He will\r\nshortly die, and it shall not be remembered that he ever performed\r\nan act or said a word that blessed or comforted or relieved his\r\nsuffering fellows.\" To further darken the picture, he contrasts\r\nSpencer with the late Cardinal Newman, who wrote the hymn \"Lead,\r\nkindly light,\" and who, we are told, if he had done nothing more,\r\nwould have been \"followed by the blessings and the prayers of those\r\nwhom he had comforted and saved.\" Again, dealing with the modern\r\nscientific view that, in the development of the human individual\r\nall antecedent stages of human development are, in a manner, passed\r\nthrough, he says: \"Let us discard the primitive-man theory. You do\r\nnot believe it. Rather shall we not hold with Emerson that every\r\nchild born into the world is a new Messiah given into the arms of\r\nfallen humanity to lead them back to paradise?\"\r\n\r\nIt is no part of our purpose to defend Mr. Spencer against the\r\nattacks of so negligible an assailant as Mr. Smith, of Minnesota.\r\nThe words that Mr. Spencer has spoken for truth, for justice,\r\nfor humanity, for peace, are his sufficient commendation and\r\nvindication--were vindication needed--in the eyes of all who have any\r\ncompetent knowledge of contemporary thought. If these words do not\r\nhelp to make the world better we should feel little inclined to put\r\nour trust in the most skillfully constructed sacred lyric. Men do not\r\nalways know their benefactors; and it is altogether possible, nay\r\nprobable, that thousands who perhaps never heard Mr. Spencer's name\r\nhave benefited through the greater consideration with which they have\r\nbeen treated by others, owing to his teaching. It is quite possible\r\nfor men, yes, and women too, to sing \"Lead, kindly light\" with great\r\nunction, and yet to be the ardent abettors of warlike sentiments and\r\nwarlike acts--to revel in a ruthless and immoral jingoism. Dryden\r\nwas not referring to the adherents of any evolutionist philosophy\r\nwhen he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"In lusts we wallow, and with pride we swell,\r\n    And injuries with injuries repel;\r\n    Prompt to revenge, not daring to forgive,\r\n    Our lives unteach the doctrine we believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not daring to forgive\" is good, and nearly as true in the nineteenth\r\ncentury as it was in the seventeenth. The one English statesman\r\nwho dared to forgive a defeat inflicted on English arms and to\r\nacknowledge an error, incurred by that single act a deeper hatred and\r\ncontempt than he earned by anything else, or all else, in his long\r\nand storm-tossed career. We refer to the action taken by Gladstone\r\nafter the battle of Majuba Hill. And we are much mistaken if the\r\nmajority of those who execrated him most deeply for not crushing the\r\nBoers under England's overwhelming force were not immense admirers of\r\nthe cardinal's hymn. What is certain is that they were not immense\r\nadmirers of Spencer, and that Spencer did not immensely admire them.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Smith has quoted Emerson, but he does not occupy the\r\nstandpoint that enables him to see Emerson in true perspective,\r\nor to feel what his philosophy lacks when confronted with the\r\nnewer knowledge of the century. Mr. J. J. Chapman, in his recent\r\nmemorable book of essays, gives us a better view. \"A critic in the\r\nmodern sense,\" Mr. Chapman says, \"he (Emerson) was not. He lived\r\ntoo early and at too great a distance from the forum of European\r\nthought to absorb the ideas of evolution, and give place to them\r\nin his philosophy.... We miss in Emerson the underlying conception\r\nof growth, of development, so characteristic of the thought of our\r\nown day, and which, for instance, is found everywhere latent in\r\nBrowning's poetry.... He is probably the last great writer to look at\r\nlife from a stationary standpoint.\"\r\n\r\nThat the doctrine of evolution constitutes to-day a most important\r\nguiding principle in education no competent educationist could be\r\nfound to deny. It teaches us to deal with the young as in a very true\r\nsense the heirs of all the ages, to make due allowance in childhood\r\nfor instincts and habits which partake of the earlier stages of human\r\ndevelopment, and to look forward with confidence to later and higher\r\nmanifestations. We have less faith than our ancestors had in the\r\nrod, and more in the gradual unfolding of the powers and capacities\r\nof the mind, and therewith the enlargement and improvement of the\r\nmoral nature. We do not believe as our forefathers did in breaking\r\nchildren's wills; nor do we view their peccadilloes in the lurid\r\nlight of a gloomy theological creed. We recognize that veracity, in\r\nthe sense of strict accuracy of speech, purged of all imaginative\r\nelements, is a virtue which not all adults are able to practice, and\r\nwhich is not a natural product of the child mind. We can not accept\r\nEmerson's doctrine of infant Messiahs, and yet we can recognize very\r\nfully the mission of the child in the home, the demand it makes for\r\ntenderness, for patience, for thoughtfulness on the part of parents,\r\nthe hopes and fears and heart-searchings that it calls into play,\r\nthe aspirations that it promotes toward the realization, if for\r\nits sake only, of a higher life. Froebel grasped a large measure\r\nof truth in regard to children, but too much of sentiment, in our\r\nopinion, entered into his treatment of them. In the full light of the\r\ndoctrine of evolution we take them as they are, and help them to work\r\nout under favorable conditions that development of which they are\r\ncapable. We are not imposed upon by childish imitations of mature\r\nvirtues, and are rather disposed to repress recognized tendencies to\r\nprecocity; but we believe that the germs of good are sown in every\r\nnormal human being, and that, unless killed by most unwise treatment,\r\nthey will fructify in due time.\r\n\r\nWhat we may well consider seriously is whether our modern modes of\r\nlife enable us to do that justice to children which evolutionary\r\nteaching requires. Can true health of body and mind be conciliated\r\nwith social ambition or with commercial ambition? Are we not hampered\r\nat every turn by false schemes of education, the object of which\r\nis to turn out certain conventional products? How many of us can\r\nrise up in effective rebellion against the very fashions that in\r\nour hearts we most condemn? Before there can be anything like a\r\nperfect education for the young there must be a much more fully\r\ndeveloped sense of duty than we see as yet in the older generation.\r\nThe doctrine of evolution is putting the key to a true system into\r\nour hands; but to use that key aright requires courage and high\r\npurpose--qualities that are not of everyday occurrence. Still, it is\r\nmatter of congratulation that the truth is not far from us. It is\r\nwell established in our theories, and one of these days we may hope\r\nit will gain a wide and secure footing in our practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_DAVID AMES WELLS._\r\n\r\nIn the death of David A. Wells, which occurred at his home in\r\nNorwich, Connecticut, on the 5th of November, 1898, America has\r\nlost one of her ablest and most productive men of letters and\r\nscience a distinguished representative. Out of a life of seventy\r\nyears it may fairly be said that Mr. Wells gave fifty of them to\r\nintellectual pursuits, which were mainly devoted to the advance of\r\nscience and its application to practical affairs. After passing the\r\nperiod of early study, and particularly since he became interested\r\nin economic questions, much of his work was in the line of original\r\ninvestigation, the results of which have from time to time been given\r\nto the public either through his books or in the magazines. Another\r\nand more conspicuous feature of his career, the one perhaps that\r\nmade him best known at home and first gave him reputation abroad,\r\nwas the valuable service that he rendered the country at large in\r\nstraightening out the financial tangle the Government had got itself\r\ninto during and after the civil war. In this undertaking his great\r\nstore of learning, rare practical sagacity, and unwavering confidence\r\nin the final result, carried him through to a brilliant success,\r\nearning for him in high quarters the most flattering testimonials of\r\nadmiration and respect.\r\n\r\nLooked at in the light of what he actually achieved, Mr. Wells's\r\npreparation for his life work seems to have been almost an ideal one.\r\nGifted with a strong love of Nature and having a decidedly practical\r\nturn of mind, he early showed a fondness for the study of science.\r\nThis led him, soon after graduating from Williams College in 1847,\r\nto enter the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University. Here\r\nhe completed the course with the first class that was graduated by\r\nthat institution in 1852. While studying in the scientific school\r\nyoung Wells became the special pupil of Agassiz, and, as the sequel\r\nshows, caught the enthusiasm with which that great master was wont to\r\ninspire the young men who were fortunate enough to come within the\r\nrange of his influence. During this period Mr. Wells, in association\r\nwith Mr. George Bliss, began the compilation and publication of the\r\nAnnual of Scientific Discovery, which he continued for some sixteen\r\nyears. That he was a clever student with quite exceptional endowments\r\nis seen in the circumstance that immediately after graduation he was\r\nappointed assistant professor in the scientific school and lecturer\r\non physics and chemistry in Groton Academy, Massachusetts. He also,\r\nbetween 1857 and 1863, prepared a series of scientific school books\r\nembracing the subjects of physics, chemistry, and geology, and a\r\nvolume on the Science of Common Things, all of which attained a wide\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nThus for a period of nearly fifteen years Mr. Wells had devoted\r\nhimself assiduously to the cultivation of the physical sciences.\r\nBeginning with the practical operations of the laboratory, where the\r\nvalue of experiment and observation is made apparent, his work was\r\ncontinued in the strengthening and developing experiences of the\r\nteacher, and thence led up to that wider knowledge and that clearness\r\nof exposition which a bright mind would acquire in the preparation\r\nof a number of successful scientific class books. It may be presumed\r\nthat by this time he was thoroughly acquainted with scientific method\r\nin its applications to the investigation and explanation of physical\r\nphenomena. With the results this had yielded in building up the great\r\nbody of verified knowledge composing the several sciences he must\r\nalso have been familiar. Mentally alert and with sharpened powers\r\nof observation, he was able to seize and classify the facts bearing\r\nupon the problem in hand, and subject them to systematic processes of\r\nscientific reasoning.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, was the training and such the equipment brought by\r\nMr. Wells to the study of economic questions when he first began to\r\nwrite upon them in 1864. A better preparation for the work to which\r\nhe was to give the next thirty years of his life can scarcely be\r\nimagined. While it is quite true that in entering this new field he\r\nwas to encounter a class of facts and variety of phenomena that were\r\nof a very different order from those with which he had previously\r\nbeen dealing, their apparently haphazard character did not deceive\r\nhim. Well versed in the practice of tracing effects to causes,\r\ngifted with remarkable powers of insight, and thoroughly believing\r\nthat the methods of science would prove as available in the study of\r\neconomics as in other fields, he began his investigations without\r\nmisgiving, patiently accumulated and studied the facts, and when\r\nconclusions were arrived at, no matter how contrary they might be\r\nto current teaching, fearlessly announced and defended them. Though\r\nhalf his life a firm believer in the doctrine of protection, when\r\nMr. Wells went to Europe for the Government in 1867 to investigate\r\nthe subject of tariff taxation, high and low tariff countries alike\r\nwere visited, with the determination to leave nothing undone that\r\nwould aid to a better understanding of the question. All the varied\r\naspects of the problem were carefully studied in connection with\r\nthe principal industries of the respective countries, and, finding\r\nreason in the facts thus obtained to revise his opinions, he came\r\nhome a convert to free trade. For an account of what he had observed\r\nduring the course of his investigations, and of the conclusions\r\nbased thereon, the reader is referred to the fourth volume of his\r\nreports as commissioner of internal revenue, published in 1869. His\r\nbook on Recent Economic Changes, and the papers on The Principles of\r\nTaxation, that have appeared in this magazine during the last two\r\nyears, are records of equally painstaking research. Moreover, they\r\nare both excellent examples of what a strict adherence to scientific\r\nmethod has done and may yet be expected to do toward clearing up the\r\nknotty problems in economics that are now engaging public attention.\r\n\r\nUnited with his great learning, and a rare power of generalization,\r\nMr. Wells possessed in full measure that intellectual honesty which\r\nis the indispensable characteristic of the true man of science. This\r\nenabled him to follow without doubt or hesitation wherever the facts\r\nmight lead; and with his clear perception of their real import,\r\njoined to his habit of independent thought, traits that are displayed\r\nthroughout all his more formal writings, they are what in our opinion\r\nconstitute his title to distinction. They give to his teachings,\r\nwhich have already done more than any other agency that we know\r\ntoward placing the subject of political economy on a sound scientific\r\nbasis, a high and enduring character.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A BORROWED FOUNDATION._\r\n\r\n\"The central idea of Professor Giddings's Principles of Sociology,\r\na work that has the honor of being the first independent attempt in\r\nEnglish to treat of sociology as such, is that we must postulate\r\non the part of human beings what he calls a _consciousness of\r\nkind_. Critics of his volume have naturally told him that this is\r\nessentially a philosophical idea, found in Hegel and in British\r\nethical writers of the eighteenth century.\"\r\n\r\nWe quote the above from an article by Professor Caldwell, entitled\r\nPhilosophy and the Newer Sociology, in the October Contemporary. We\r\nare not prepared to dispute Professor Caldwell's statement that the\r\nidea of the \"consciousness of kind\" may be found in the writers to\r\nwhom he refers; but it would have been very much to the point if he\r\nhad mentioned that it is to be found most clearly enunciated in Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer's Principles of Sociology. In an article contributed\r\nto this magazine in December, 1896, Mr. Spencer took occasion to\r\npoint out that what Professor Giddings seemed to regard as an\r\n_aperçu_ peculiar to himself had been distinctly formulated years\r\nbefore in his own writings. In proof of this he quoted the following\r\npassages:\r\n\r\n\"Sociality having thus commenced, and survival of the fittest tending\r\never to maintain and increase it, it will be further strengthened by\r\nthe inherited effects of habit. _The perception of kindred beings,\r\nperpetually seen, heard, and smelt, will come to form a predominant\r\npart of consciousness-_-so predominant that absence of it will\r\ninevitably cause discomfort.\" \"Among creatures led step by step into\r\ngregariousness, there will little by little be established a pleasure\r\nin being together--a pleasure in the consciousness of one another's\r\npresence--a pleasure simpler than, and quite distinct from, those\r\nhigher ones which it makes possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that there is much more in Spencer than most recent\r\nwriters have ever explored; and the newer sociologists would do well,\r\nbefore putting forward claims to originality, to make sure that they\r\nhave not been anticipated by the veteran philosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Literature.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn _The Play of Animals_[59] we are offered a book upon an\r\nessentially new topic; for, although much has been written concerning\r\nthe habits and intelligence of animals, no special consideration has\r\nbeen given to their play or its psychic significance. The survey of\r\nthis virgin territory seems to the critical reader to have disclosed\r\nsuch limitless area to Professor Groos that he fails to indicate its\r\nlegitimate boundaries. He confesses himself overcome by a sense of\r\nits vastness, stating that the \"versatility needed for a thorough\r\ninvestigation is so comprehensive that it is unattainable by an\r\nordinary mortal.\"\r\n\r\nPlay, he finds, is not \"an aimless activity carried on for its own\r\nsake\"; neither is it the product of surplus physical energy, as Mr.\r\nSpencer defines it, for in youth there is playfulness without this\r\ncondition. Instincts useful in preserving the species appear before\r\nthey are seriously needed, and are utilized in play, which serves as\r\npreparation for the tasks of life. \"Animals do not play because they\r\nare young, but have a period of youth in order to play.\"\r\n\r\nThe special ends accomplished by play are control of the body,\r\ncommand of the means of locomotion, agility in pursuit of prey and\r\nin escaping danger, and prowess in fighting. The games pursued\r\nin attaining these ends are classified in nine groups, beginning\r\nwith those of experimentation and ending with those referred to\r\ncuriosity. They include plays of movement, hunting, fighting, love,\r\nconstruction, nursing, and imitation. For all of these Professor\r\nGroos finds but one instinct of play responsible, supplemented by\r\nthe instinct of imitation. He enters into an elaborate discussion\r\nof instinct, giving an outline of Weismann's theory of heredity and\r\nthe views of various writers. He adopts Herbert Spencer's definition\r\nof instinct as a complex reflex act, referring its origin to the\r\noperation of natural selection, acknowledging the process to be\r\nbeyond our grasp. In seeking to explain bird song and the love play\r\nof animals, the theory of sexual selection is not accepted by him\r\nwithout qualification; a modification of the Darwinian principle\r\nis suggested in which the female exerts an unconscious choice.\r\nThe psychic characteristics of play are the pleasure following\r\nsatisfaction of instinct, energetic action and joy in the acquirement\r\nof power. The animal at first masters its own bodily movements, then\r\nseeks the conquest of other animals and inanimate objects. When a\r\ncertain facility in play has been gained a higher intellectual stage\r\nis entered upon, that of make-believe, or playing a part. This state\r\nof conscious self-illusion is reached by many of the higher animals.\r\nPsychically, it indicates a divided consciousness, and occupies a\r\nplace between the ordinary state and the abnormal ones of hypnosis\r\nand hysteria. To this condition Professor Groos ascribes the genesis\r\nof artistic production, an hypothesis that he has elaborated more\r\nfully in _Einleitung in die Aesthetik_.\r\n\r\nThe experimental plays of animals, divided into those of courtship,\r\nimitation, and construction, correspond to the principles of self\r\nexhibition, imitation, and decoration, which are claimed to be the\r\nmotives of human art. The acquirement of power through play develops\r\na feeling of freedom, and this the artist likewise seeks to realize\r\nin the world of ideals.\r\n\r\nArtists will not probably acknowledge that \"life is earnest, art is\r\nplayful,\" nor moralists agree that \"man is only human when he plays,\r\nfor there is no real freedom in the sphere of experience,\" yet both\r\nmay find food for thought in Professor Groos's analysis of play.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE\r\n\r\n[59] The Play of Animals. By Karl Groos. Translated by Elizabeth L.\r\nBaldwin. New York: D. Appleton and Company. Pp. 341. Price, $1.75.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the spasm of unreasoning hostility to Spain which has come over\r\nthe people of the United States, succeeding a period of effusive\r\nadmiration, the public are apt to forget that that nation has done\r\nanything creditable for the promotion of civilization. Yet, leaving\r\nout other fields of culture for the present, it has produced two\r\npainters who rank among the great masters, besides numerous secondary\r\nartists, rivals of any of that grade in the world, and a voluminous\r\nliterature which George Ticknor thought it worth while to make the\r\nstudy of his life, and which inspired the pens of Irving, Longfellow\r\nand Lockhart. One of the works of this literature ranks among the\r\nworld's greatest classics, and has been, perhaps, after the Bible\r\nand Shakespeare more universally read than any other book; and\r\nnumerous other works--chiefly romances--have furnished patterns or\r\nthemes for the poets, novelists, and dramatists of other nations.\r\nMr. _Fitz Maurice Kelly's_ excellent and convenient _History of\r\nSpanish Literature_[60] therefore comes in good time to refresh\r\nour memories concerning these facts. One does not have to go very\r\nfar in the history to find that of the great Latin writers of the\r\nage of the Cæsars, the two Senecas, Lucan the poet of Pharsalia,\r\nMartial the epigrammatist, and Quintilian the rhetorician--still\r\nan authority--and many minor writers, \"were Spaniards as well as\r\nRomans.\" It also appears that of what Gibbon declared to have been\r\nthe happiest epoch of man's history--from the death of Domitian to\r\nthe accession of Commodus, seventy of the eighty years, if we take\r\nthe liberty, as Mr. Kelly does, of counting Marcus Aurelius as a\r\nCordovan, were passed beneath the scepter of the Spanish Cæsars.\r\nPrudentius, a distinguished Latin Christian writer of a succeeding\r\nage, was also a Spaniard. Although there were \"archaic\" works of\r\n_trovadors_ before that time, traditionally preserved by _juglars_,\r\nSpanish literature proper began in the twelfth century. It owed\r\nmuch to French and Italian, and in course of time gave much back to\r\nthem. Among its earliest signs was the development of the romance\r\n(ballad), while Arab writers (whose work Mr. Kelly considers of\r\ndoubtful value) and Jews, who are better spoken of, were early\r\ncontributors to it. The earliest works of importance were the\r\nMystery of the Magian Kings, one of the first plays in any modern\r\nlanguage, and the great heroic poem of the Cid, both anonymous.\r\nThe first Castilian poet whose name has reached us was Gonzalo de\r\nBerceo, 1198 to 1264, who wrote much, and was, \"if not an inventor,\r\nthe chief of a school.\" Permanent form was given to Spanish prose\r\nby King Alfonso the Learned, 1226 to 1284, who, \"like Bacon, took\r\nall knowledge for his province, and in every department shone\r\npre-eminent.\" He had numerous collaborators, and \"his example in so\r\nmany fields was followed\"--among others (in some of them) by his\r\nson and successor, Sancho IV. The Infanta, Juan Manuel, nephew of\r\nAlfonso, in one of the stories of his Conde Lucanor--\"one of the\r\nbooks of the world\"--created the germ of the Taming of the Shrew.\r\nPassing a numerous list of writers of respectable merit, for whose\r\nnames even we have not room, we come to the age of the Catholic\r\nkings and Charles V, when for a hundred and fifty years literature\r\nmost flourished in Spain. Among the features of this period are the\r\nAmadis de Gaul--\"the best in that kind\"--which inspired Cervantes;\r\nColumbus, who, though of Italian birth, \"was probably the truest\r\nSpaniard in all the Spains,\" the poet Garcilaso de la Vega, and\r\nBernal Diaz and other historians whose names dot Prescott's books.\r\nPassing a large number of writers of mark whose works appeared in\r\nthis age, and stopping only to mention Alonzo de Ercilla y Zuñiga's\r\nAraucana as the first literary work of real merit composed in either\r\nAmerican continent, we come to the age of Cervantes, whose story of\r\nDon Quixote--\"the friendless people's friend,\" as Browning styles\r\nhim--is not more distinguished for its satirical wit and humor than\r\nfor its kindly humanity; and Lope de Vega, that most prolific of\r\nall dramatic authors, who \"left no achievement unattempted,\" and\r\ndied lamented by a hundred and fifty-three Spanish and fifty Italian\r\nauthors, who sang his praises. Among other of the most distinguished\r\nwriters of this and succeeding periods are Mariana, \"the greatest\r\nof all Spanish historians\"; Góngora, a famous poet in his day;\r\nQuevedo; Tirse de Molina, the creator of Don Juan; Calderon, second\r\nas a dramatist among Spaniards, if second, only to Lope de Vega, and\r\nAlarcón his compeer; and Velasquez, great in art and not small in\r\nletters. An interregnum came in during the reign of Carlos II, and\r\nFrench influence made itself felt. The age of the Bourbons produced\r\namong others the Benedictine Sarmiento, who as a botanist \"won the\r\nadmiration and friendship of Linné.\" The present century has been\r\nmarked by the names of many authors of merit, novelists known to us\r\nin translations, by an active movement of historical composition\r\ndeveloping brilliant monographs, and by a marked advance of\r\nscholarship and tolerance, led by Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo; with a\r\ntendency to produce \"a breed of writers of the German type.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[60] A History of Spanish Literature. By James Fitz Maurice-Kelly.\r\nNew York: D. Appleton and Company. (Literature of the World Series.\r\nEdited by Edmund Gosse.) Pp. 433. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTICES.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the problems of forestry and all that\r\npertains to them can not fail to be appreciated by any one who has\r\nseen the devastation wrought in many sections of this country by\r\nthe \"wood chopper.\" Forestry is one of the subjects where natural\r\nscience can step in and guide the way to economic success, and\r\nwhere, in default of scientific methods, economically fatal results\r\ninevitably ensue. The preservation of forests has been an important\r\nproblem in Europe for many years, but until quite recently it has\r\nreceived little attention in the United States. One of the pioneers\r\nin the field of forestry in this country was Franklin B. Hough,\r\nwhose Elements of Forestry is still a used and useful manual.\r\nAmong his many schemes for attracting attention and study to this\r\nimportant subject was one of making actual sections of the wood\r\nof American trees, and arranging them in a compact and attractive\r\nmanner for general distribution. This idea he never carried out,\r\nand it has remained for his son, Mr. R. B. Hough, to finally carry\r\nout the scheme, by publishing a complete series of such sections,\r\ncarefully prepared and compactly bound.[61] In Part I of the series\r\nthere are cuttings representing twenty-five species of American\r\ntrees. The sections are sufficiently thin to allow of their study\r\nby transmitted light. There are three cuttings from each species,\r\ntransverse, radial, and tangential to the grain. An accompanying text\r\ngives a condensed description of each tree, including its physical\r\nproperties, uses, and habitat. These descriptions are preceded by a\r\nuseful introduction to the study of general botany, describing the\r\nmethods of distinguishing and naming the various parts of plants\r\nand trees, and giving an account of their structure and methods of\r\ngrowth. The actual wood sections, quite apart from their scientific\r\nvalue, are worthy of attention because of their great beauty. They\r\nare substantially mounted on black cardboard, each card containing\r\nthe three sections of a species, and its common name in English,\r\nFrench, German, and Spanish. The thinness of the cuttings makes it\r\npossible to use them as transparencies, thus bringing out the texture\r\nof the wood in a very effective way.\r\n\r\nProf. _Charles Reid Barnes_ is impressed with the fact that while\r\nlaboratory work has become nearly universal in botany, and laboratory\r\nmanuals are numerous, there is still a lack of books giving an\r\nelementary account of the form and functions of plants of all groups.\r\nTo supply this want he offers _Plant Life_[62] as an attempt to\r\nexhibit the variety and progressive complexity of the vegetative\r\nbody; to discuss the more important functions; to explain the unity\r\nof plan in both the structure and action of the reproductive organs;\r\nand to give an outline of the more striking ways in which plants\r\nadapt themselves to the world about them. He has made the effort to\r\ntreat these subjects so that, however much the student may still have\r\nto learn, he will have little to unlearn. The book is not intended\r\nto be memorized and recited, but to be intelligible to pupils\r\nfrom thirteen to eighteen years of age who are engaged in genuine\r\nlaboratory study under the direction \"of a live teacher who has\r\nstudied far more botany than he is trying to teach.\" It is adapted\r\nto use supplementarily to any laboratory guide or to the directions\r\nprepared by the teacher. The directions are made fullest in relation\r\nto cryptogams and physiology, because these fields are at present\r\nmost unfamiliar to teachers.\r\n\r\nAttaching great importance to _Electro-Dynamics_, which he thinks\r\nwill in the near future assume the same relation to the electric\r\nmotor that the science of thermo-dynamics already bears to the\r\nsteam engine, Mr. _Charles Ashley Carus-Wilson_ aims in the book\r\nof that name[63] to apply the principles of that science to the\r\ndirect-current motor. Writing for electrical engineers particularly,\r\nhe takes for granted a certain acquaintance with the use and design\r\nof motors, but avoids unexplained technicalities as far as possible.\r\nHe has not deemed it necessary to deal with self-induction, except\r\nin connection with the question of sparking. The numerical accuracy\r\nattempted has been limited to that attainable with an ordinary\r\nten-inch slide rule, on which all the examples have been worked out.\r\nImportance is attached to the graphic method of solution.\r\n\r\nOf Dr. _Frank Overton's_ three books on _Applied Physiology_,[64]\r\nthe first or primary grade follows a natural order of treatment,\r\npresenting in each subject elementary anatomical facts in a manner\r\nthat impresses function rather than form, and from the form described\r\nderives the function. The facts and principles are then applied to\r\neveryday life. The intermediate grade, besides being an introduction\r\nto the study of anatomy and physiology, is intended to be a complete\r\nelementary book in itself, giving a clear picture of how each organ\r\nof the body performs its work. The advanced grade book was suggested\r\nby a series of popular lectures in which the author presented the\r\nessential principles of physiology about which a physician is\r\nconsulted daily. His explanations of many common facts were novel\r\nto his auditors, and it was found that the school books were silent\r\nupon many of these points, especially with regard to the cells.\r\nThroughout the series the fact that the cells are the units in which\r\nlife exists and acts is emphasized. The author has endeavored to\r\ninclude all the useful points of the older text-books, and to add\r\nsuch new matter as the recent progress of physiological and hygienic\r\nscience demands. Avoiding technical terms, he has sought to express\r\nthe truths in simple language, \"such as he would use in instructing a\r\nmother as to the nature of the sickness of her child.\" The subjects\r\nof alcohol and other narcotics are made prominent in all the books,\r\nand are discussed fully in the third of the series. The relation\r\nof respiration and oxidation to the disappearance of food, to the\r\nproduction of waste matters, and to the development of heat and\r\nforce, is dwelt upon. Simple and easy demonstrations, many of them\r\nnew, are provided at the ends of chapters. A chapter on Repairs of\r\nInjuries, or the restoration of the natural functions, when impaired,\r\nby the body, is new in a school textbook.\r\n\r\nIn _Yetta Ségal_,[65] a slender thread of a story is used by Mr.\r\n_Rollin_ as the vehicle for a theory of \"type fusion\" or convergence\r\nwhich he thinks has not received sufficient attention from social\r\nor scientific students. There are a pair of lovers, one of whom is\r\ndiscovered at a critical period in the courtship to have negro blood\r\nin his veins, and a philosopher who comes forward to satisfy the\r\nparties (who hardly need it) that this is no serious matter, but is\r\nall according to human evolution and the destiny of the race. \"You\r\nmust be impressed,\" he says, \"by the fact that there are a great\r\nmany people here and there, of mixed blood, and that the number is\r\nincreasing; ... it is well that not a few are indeed truly admirable\r\nspecimens of the human race. Such phenomena must be interpreted in\r\na way consistent with man's nature: if he is developmental; if he\r\nshall attain a higher status through struggle, or through means that\r\nare seemingly, or for the time, degrading; if he is moving from the\r\nsimple to the complex, as to organization; if universal movement\r\ntends to unific existence--then race interchange, with elimination\r\nof peculiar characteristics, has probably made its appearance as a\r\nphase of infinite order, and for the benefit of future man.... It is\r\npresumptuous for the wisest to assert that the man of lower type has\r\nno element of strength peculiar to his race which the most advanced\r\ndoes not need in his present organization. It may be needed either\r\nfor present protection in the way of re-enforcement, or as an element\r\nof strength for further advancement.\" Mr. Rollin does not advocate\r\ntype fusion or wish to accelerate the movement, but presents it as\r\na fact and factor in human evolution deserving more extensive and\r\nthorough study than it has received.\r\n\r\nThe increasing attention which of late years has been given to the\r\nstudy of comparative anatomy has finally resulted in what promises\r\nto be a complete and detailed account of the structure of a subhuman\r\nmammal.[66] The author, Dr. _Jayne_, believes that a course in\r\nmammalian anatomy offers a valuable preliminary to the study of\r\nmedicine, and this is the purpose for which the book has been made.\r\nThis is to a certain extent true, especially where, as in the case\r\nof the cat, there is so close a similarity to the structure of the\r\nhuman body. But the chief scientific interest and value of such a\r\nwork must lie in its broader philosophic aspects; in the aid which\r\nit can not but give in clearing up some of the many mooted points of\r\nevolutional biology, and in the stimulus which it will impart to the\r\nstudy of relationships among the lower animals. The present volume,\r\nthe first of the series, deals only with the skeleton of the cat,\r\neach bone being first studied individually, then in its relations to\r\nother bones and to the muscular system and the skeleton as a whole,\r\nand finally in comparison with the corresponding portion of the\r\nhuman skeleton. There are 611 extremely good illustrations, and the\r\nprinting of the volume is unusually clean and attractive.\r\n\r\nAmong the articles of special value in recent numbers of the\r\n(bimonthly) _Bulletin of the Department of Labor_, under the\r\neditorial control of Commissioner _Carroll D. Wright_ and Chief\r\nClerk _O. D. Weaver_, are those on Boarding Houses and Clubs for\r\nWorking Women, by Mary S. Ferguson, in the March number; The Alaskan\r\nGold Fields and the Opportunities they afford for Capital and Labor,\r\nby S. C. Durham, in the May number; Economic Aspects of the Liquor\r\nProblem; Brotherhood Relief and Insurance of Railway Employees, by E.\r\nR. Johnson, Ph. D.; and The Nations of Antwerp, by J. H. Gore, Ph.\r\nD., in the July number. Summaries of reports of labor statistics, of\r\nlegislation and decisions of courts affecting labor, and of recent\r\nGovernment contracts constitute regular departments of the bulletin.\r\n(Washington.)\r\n\r\nFor delicate humor and refined art of expression few writers can\r\nexcel Jean Paul Friedrich Richter, but the sources of his rich\r\nflow of humor are so deeply hidden and his expression is so very\r\nsubtle that the generality of those who attempt to read his works\r\nfail to appreciate him or even to understand him, and give him up.\r\nThe pleasure of appreciating him is, however, worth the pains of\r\nlearning to do so. Those who are willing to undertake this, and who\r\nread German, may find help in the _Selections from the Works of\r\nJean Paul Friedrich Richter_, prepared by _George Stuart Collins_,\r\nand published by the American Book Company. The book is intended\r\nfor students of German who have attained a certain mastery of the\r\nlanguage. Pains have been taken to avoid such passages as might\r\nfrom their mere difficulty discourage the reader, and to choose\r\nsuch as would be complete in themselves. The selections are made\r\nfrom the shorter writings of the author, and each is intended to be\r\nrepresentative of some feature of his manifold genius and style.\r\n\r\nA notice of the _Stenotypy_, or system of shorthand for the\r\ntypewriter, of _D. A. Quinn_, was published in the Popular Science\r\nMonthly in March, 1896. It is really a system of phonography to be\r\nused with the typewriter whenever it is practicable to employ that\r\ninstrument. A second edition of Mr. Quinn's manual and exercises\r\nfor the practice of the system is published by the American Book\r\nExchange, Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\nA paper on _Polished-Stone Articles used by the New York Aborigines\r\nbefore and during European Occupation_, published as a Bulletin of\r\nthe New York State Museum, is complementary to a previous bulletin\r\non articles of chipped stone. Both papers are by the Rev. Dr. _W. M.\r\nBeauchamp_, and are illustrated by figures from his large collection\r\nof original drawings, made in nearly all parts of New York, but\r\nmostly from the central portion. While the chipped implements are\r\nmore numerous and widespread than those treated of in the present\r\nbulletin, the latter show great patience and skill in their higher\r\nforms and taste in selecting materials, and they give hints of\r\nsuperstitions and ceremonies not yet thoroughly understood.\r\n\r\n_Henry Goldman_ has invented, in the arithmachine, what he claims is\r\na rapid and reliable computing machine of small dimensions and large\r\ncapacity, with other advantages. He now offers, as a companion to it,\r\n_The Arithmachinist_, a book intended to serve as a self-instructor\r\nin mechanical arithmetic. It gives historical and technical\r\nchapters on the calculating machines of the past, describes the\r\nprinciples controlling the construction and operations, and furnishes\r\nexplanations concerning the author's own device. (Published by the\r\nOffice Men's Record Company, Chicago, for one dollar.)\r\n\r\nThe _Bulletin from the Laboratories of Natural History of the\r\nState University of Iowa_, Vol. IV, No. 3, contains two technical\r\narticles: On the Actinaria, collected by the Bahama Expedition of the\r\nUniversity, in 1891, by J. P. McMurrich, and the Brachyura of the\r\nBiological Expedition to the Florida Keys and the Bahamas in 1893, by\r\nMary J. Rathbun; and a list of the coleoptera of Southern Arizona,\r\nby H. F. Wickham. Mr. Wickham observes that the insects of northern\r\nArizona are widely different from those of the southern part, a fact\r\nwhich he ascribes to difference of altitude, and, consequently, in\r\nvegetation. The Bulletin is sold for fifty cents a copy.\r\n\r\nTwo books in English--_Elementary English_ and _Elements of Grammar\r\nand Composition_--prepared by _E. Oram Lyte_, and published by the\r\nAmerican Book Company, are intended to include and cover a complete\r\ngraded course in language lessons, grammar, and composition for\r\nstudy in the primary and grammar grades of schools. The endeavor\r\nhas been made to present the subject in such a way that the pupil\r\nshall become interested in the study from the first. The first\r\nbook, Elementary English, is designed to furnish material for\r\nprimary language work, and to show how this material can be used\r\nto advantage, embodying and representing the natural methods of\r\nlanguage teaching. The child is given something to do--easy and\r\npractical--at every point, and is not troubled by formal definitions\r\nand rules to be committed to memory. The second book is also based\r\non the principle that the best way to gain a working knowledge of\r\nthe English language is by the working or laboratory method. It is\r\ntherefore largely made up of exercises, and aims to teach through\r\npractice. The subject is unfolded from a psychological rather than\r\na logical point of view. What is to be memorized is reduced to a\r\nminimum, and not presented till the pupil is ready for it. The\r\nlessons in literature and composition are designed to help the pupil\r\nto appreciate worth and beauty of literature, and lead him to fluent\r\nand accurate expression.\r\n\r\n_The Bulletin of the Geological Institution of the University\r\nof Upsala_ presents a series of special papers of much interest\r\nto students of that science, on studies in geology, largely of\r\nScandinavia, but of other countries as well. Part 2 of Vol. III, now\r\nbefore us, has such papers on Silurian Coral Reefs in Gothland, by\r\nCarl Wiman; the Quaternary Mammalia of Sweden, by Rutger Sernander;\r\nSome Ore Deposits of the Atacama Desert, by Otto Nordenskiold;\r\nthe Structure of some Gothlandish Graphites, by Carl Wiman; the\r\nInterglacial Submergence of Great Britain, by H. Munthe; Mechanical\r\nDisturbances and Chemical Changes in the Ribbon Clays of Sweden, by\r\nP. J. Holmquist; Some Mineral Changes, by A. G. Högborn; and the\r\nProceedings of the Geological Section of the Students' Association of\r\nNatural Science, Upsala. The articles are in German, English, and (in\r\nprevious numbers) French.\r\n\r\nTwo Spanish-American works of very different character have\r\ncome to us from Valparaiso, Chili. One is entitled _Literatura\r\nArcaica--Estudios Criticos_, or critical studies of old Spanish\r\nliterature, by _Eduardo de la Barra_, of the Royal Spanish Academy,\r\nwhich were communicated to the Latin-American Scientific Congress\r\nat Buenos Ayres. The author was invited to present to the congress\r\nthe fruits of his extensive studies on the Poem of the Cid, but\r\nafterward modified his plan and gave these, the results of his more\r\ngeneral investigations of the romances of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, which Spanish critics regard as the most ancient they\r\nhave, and other romances attributed to the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies, with an article on the Cid. This work is published by K.\r\nNewman, Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nThe other book is a volume of _Rrimas_, or rhymes, by _Gustabo Adolfo\r\nBéker_, published by Carlos Cabezon, at Valparaiso. The ordinary\r\nstudent might think that the Spanish language is one of those least\r\nin need of spelling reform, but not so the author and publisher of\r\nthese poems, which are presented in the most radically \"reformed\"\r\nspelling, and with them comes a pamphlet setting forth the character\r\nand principles of \"Ortografia Rrazional.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of a study of seventy-three Irish and Irish-American\r\ncriminals made at the Kings County Penitentiary, Brooklyn, N. Y., by\r\nDr. _H. L. Winter_, and published as _Notes on Criminal Anthropology\r\nand Bio-Sociology_, contains numerous observations bearing upon the\r\neffect of hereditary influences in criminality, but hardly sufficient\r\nto justify the drawing of any general conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Lewis M. Rutherfurd, in developing the art of\r\nastronomical photography, naturally gave much attention to the star\r\n61 Cygni--which was the first to yield its parallax, and through\r\nwhich the possibility of measuring stellar distances was shown--and\r\nits neighbors. A number of the plates of this series were partially\r\nstudied by Miss Ida C. Martin more than twenty years ago, and the\r\nstudy has now been carried out by _Herman S. Davis_, as part of the\r\nwork of Columbia University Observatory. The results of Mr. Davis's\r\nlabors are published by the observatory in three papers: _Catalogue\r\nof Sixty-five Stars near 61 Cygni_; _The Parallaxes of 61^1 and 61^2\r\nCygni_; and _Catalogue of Thirty-four Stars near \"Bradley 3077\"_;\r\nunder a single cover.\r\n\r\nIn a small work entitled _A Theory of Life deduced from the Evolution\r\nPhilosophy_ a few thoughts are recorded by _Sylvan Drey_ relative\r\nto the manner in which, from central doctrines identical with\r\nthe teachings of Herbert Spencer, a system of religion, an ideal\r\nsociety, a theory of ethics, and a political creed--the doctrine of\r\nsocial individualism--may be built up. The religion is to recognize\r\nan inexplicable and inconceivable energy revealing itself in the\r\nuniverse, of which the highest theistic conception possible to human\r\nbeings, free from the supposition that it represents a likeness, is\r\nthe only one that can be accepted. \"Absolute truth is beyond the\r\ngrasp of human beings; but for all practical purposes the teachings\r\nof the evolution philosophy, relative truths though they may be, may\r\nbe regarded as final and conclusive.\" Mr. Drey's paper of thirty-four\r\npages is published by Williams & Norgate, London.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] The American Woods.

E. Fernow says, in a review of the work of the Department of\r\nForestry, different methods of cultivation from those given in the\r\nhumid parts are necessary, and the plant material has to be selected\r\nwith a view to a rigorous climate characterized by extreme ranges\r\nof temperature varying from -40° to +120° F. The requirements of\r\nthe plants for moisture must be of the slightest, and they must\r\nbe capable of responding to the demands of evaporation. At first,\r\nwhatever trees will grow successfully from the start under such\r\nuntoward conditions would have to be chosen, no matter what their\r\nqualities otherwise might be. The first settlers have ascertained by\r\ntrials some of the species that will succeed under such conditions,\r\nbut unfortunately most of them are of but small economic value, and\r\nsome of them are only short-lived under the conditions in which they\r\nhave to grow. A few years ago Mr. Fernow came to the conclusion that\r\nthe conifers, especially the pines, would furnish more useful and\r\notherwise serviceable material for the arid regions. Besides their\r\nsuperior economical value, they require less moisture than most of\r\nthe deciduous trees that have been planted, and they would, if once\r\nestablished, persist more readily through seasons of drought and be\r\nlonger lived. A small trial plantation on the sand hills of Nebraska\r\nlent countenance to this theory. It being vastly more difficult\r\nto establish the young plants in the first place than in the case\r\nof deciduous trees, much attention was given to the provision for\r\nprotection of the seedlings from sun and winds; and they were planted\r\nin mixture with \"nurse trees\" that would furnish not too much and yet\r\nenough shade. \"It can not be said that the success in using these\r\nspecies has so far been very encouraging; nevertheless, the failure\r\nmay be charged rather to our lack of knowledge and to causes that can\r\nbe overcome than to any inherent incapacity in the species.\" The\r\nexperiments should therefore be continued.\r\n\r\n=\"The Venerable Bede's\" Chair.=--In an article in a recent issue of\r\nArchitecture and Building, on Ancient and Modern Furniture, by F.\r\nT. Hodgson, the following interesting account of the chair of \"the\r\nVenerable Bede\" occurs: \"Perhaps the best-known relic, so far as\r\nfurniture is concerned of this early period, is the chair of 'the\r\nVenerable Bede,' which is still preserved in the vestry of Jassova\r\nChurch, Northumberland, England. This chair is distinctively an\r\necclesiastical one--a throne, in fact, of some dignity. It is made\r\nof oak and is four feet ten inches high. There are many engravings\r\nof it, but I reproduce from one of the best. The chair is now well\r\non to twelve hundred years old, and if cared for as it ought to be\r\nis good for several hundred years more. There is a popular tradition\r\nconcerning this chair that is worthy of notice. It is said that to\r\nthis ancient relic all the brides repair as soon as the marriage\r\nservice is over, in order that they may seat themselves in it. This,\r\naccording to the popular belief, will make them joyful mothers of\r\nchildren; and to omit this custom the expectant mothers would not\r\nconsider the marriage ceremony complete, and in default thereof of\r\nbeing enthroned in 'the Venerable Bede's chair' barrenness and misery\r\nwould surely follow. Like all other relics of the sort, it is subject\r\nto attacks of the sacrilegious penknives, together with the wanton\r\ndepredations of relic hunters, and has been so shorn of its fair\r\nproportions that very soon there will be little of it left but its\r\nattenuated form if stricter watch is not kept over it.\"\r\n\r\n=The Physics of Smell.=--The principal subject of Prof. W. E.\r\nAyrton's vice-presidential address on physics at the British\r\nAssociation was the physics of smell, which was presented as a\r\nsubject that had been but little studied. In testing the generally\r\naccepted idea that metals have smell, based on the fact that a smell\r\nis perceived with most of the commercial metals when handled, the\r\nauthor had observed that when these metals were cleaned or made\r\noutwardly pure the smell disappeared. Yet it is shown that these\r\nmetals acquire smells when they are handled or abraded by friction,\r\nwhich are characteristic and serve to distinguish them. This may\r\nbe ascribed to chemical action, but not all chemical action in\r\nwhich metals may take part produces smell; for when they are rubbed\r\nwith soda or with sugar no smell but that of soda or of sugar is\r\nperceived; nor is the metallic smell observed when dilute nitric\r\nacid is rubbed on certain metals, though the chemical action is very\r\nmarked with some. But mere breathing on certain metals, even when\r\nthey have been rendered practically odorless by cleaning, produces\r\na very distinct smell, as also does touching them with the tongue.\r\nThese smells have hitherto been attributed to the metals themselves,\r\nbut Professor Ayrton looks for their source in the evolution of\r\nhydrogen, which carries with it impurities, hydrocarbons, especially\r\nparaffin, and \"it is probable that no metallic particles, even in the\r\nform of vapor, reach the nose or even leave the metal. While smells\r\nusually appear to be diffused with great velocity, experiments prove\r\nthat when the space through which they have to pass is free from\r\ndraughts their progress is very slow, and it would therefore appear\r\nthat the passage of a smell is far more due to the actual motion\r\nof the air containing it than to the diffusion of the odoriferous\r\nsubstance through the air.\" The power of a smell to cling to a\r\nsubstance does not appear to depend on its intensity or on the\r\nease with which it travels through a closed space. Experiments to\r\ndetermine whether smells could pass through glass by transpiration\r\neither revealed flaws in the glass or ended in the breaking of the\r\nvery thin bulbs and gave no answer.\r\n\r\n=The Cordillera Region of Canada.=--A length of nearly thirteen\r\nhundred miles of the great mountainous or Cordillera region of the\r\nPacific coast is included in the western part of Canada. Most of\r\nthis, Mr. George M. Dawson says, in a paper on the Physical Geography\r\nand Geology of Canada, is embraced in the province of British\r\nColumbia, where it is about four hundred miles wide between the\r\nGreat Plains and the Pacific Ocean. To the north it is included in\r\nthe Yukon district of the Northwest Territory till it reaches, in a\r\nless elevated and more widely spread form, the shores of the Arctic\r\nOcean on one side and on the other passes across the one hundred and\r\nforty-first meridian of west longitude into Alaska. The orographic\r\nfeatures of this region are very complicated in detail. No existing\r\nmap yet properly represents even the principal physical outlines,\r\nand the impression gained by the traveler or explorer may well be\r\none of confusion. There are, however, the two dominant mountain\r\nsystems of the Rocky Mountains and the Coast Range. As a whole, the\r\narea of the Cordillera in Canada may be described as forest-clad,\r\nbut the growth of trees is more luxuriant on the western slopes of\r\neach of the dominant mountain ranges, in correspondence with the\r\ngreater precipitation occurring on these slopes. This is particularly\r\nthe case in the coast region and on the seaward side of the Coast\r\nRange, where magnificent and dense forests of coniferous trees\r\noccupy almost the whole available surface. The interior plateau,\r\nhowever, constitutes the southern part of a notably dry belt, and\r\nincludes wide stretches of open grass-covered hills and valleys,\r\nforming excellent cattle ranges. Farther north, along the same belt,\r\nsimilar open country appears intermittently, but the forest invades\r\nthe greater part of the region. It is only toward the arctic coast,\r\nin relatively very high latitude, that the barren arctic tundra\r\ncountry begins, which, sweeping in wider development to the westward,\r\noccupies most of the interior of Alaska. With certain exceptions\r\nthe farming land of British Columbia is confined to the valleys and\r\ntracts below three thousand feet, by reason of the summer frosts\r\noccurring at greater heights. There is, however, a considerable\r\narea of such land in the aggregate, with a soil generally of great\r\nfertility. In the southern valleys of the interior irrigation is\r\nnecessary for the growth of crops.\r\n\r\n=The \"Rabies\" Bacillus.=--Ever since the discovery of Pasteur that\r\nan attenuated virus made from the medulla or spinal cord of a dog\r\naffected by rabies was, when administered in graduated doses, a\r\nspecific against the disease, bacteriologists have been eagerly\r\nseeking to isolate the rabies bacillus. A number of observers, among\r\nthem Toll, Rivolta, and San Felice, have succeeded in staining\r\na bacillus which they claimed to be that of rabies. Memno, of\r\nRome, confirmed the observations of the preceding, and proved the\r\nvirulent character of the micro-organism, which he described as a\r\nblastomycete. He has quite recently succeeded in cultivating the\r\nbacillus in artificial media and producing typical rabies in dogs,\r\nrodents, and birds by inoculations. He found that the bacillus\r\ngrew better in fluid than in solid media, the best being bouillon\r\nwith glucose slightly acidulated with tartaric acid. The growth\r\ndid not become manifest under a week, and was easily arrested by\r\n\"air infection.\" It would thus seem that we have at last certainly\r\nestablished the bacterial origin of rabies.\r\n\r\n=The St. Kildans.=--St. Kilda, the farthest out to sea of all\r\nthe British Isles, is a rounded mountain with \"stack rocks\" and\r\nislets round it, rises twelve hundred and twenty feet in height,\r\nand contains a settlement of about seventy-five men, women, and\r\nchildren--almost the only representatives left on the British\r\nIslands of man in the hunting age. On one of the subsidiary islands,\r\nBoreray, is gathered the main body of the sea birds for which the\r\nisland is famous; and on a third, Soa, are the diminutive descendants\r\nof Viking sheep, left by old sea rovers. Mr. R. Kearton, who has\r\nrecently visited the islands for recreation among the sea birds,\r\nrepresents that in the little community of its people the ordinary\r\nand extraordinary operations of life seem inverted. Sport is a\r\nserious work; sheep herding and shearing are an exciting sport. A\r\nSt. Kildan qualifies for marriage by proving his courage and skill\r\nas a fowler, by standing on a dizzy precipice called Lover's Stone,\r\nand goes out bird snaring with a serious face. When he wants a sheep\r\nfor the butcher, he asks his friends to a sheep hunt in the island\r\nof Soa, in which dogs and men pursue the animals from rock to rock.\r\nAn offer made by a factor to supply the people with nets, so that\r\nthey might catch the sheep with more humanity and less waste of life,\r\nwas rejected by them. They preferred the old methods, which supplied\r\nplenty of danger and excitement. While the sheep are hunted, the cows\r\nare thoroughly spoiled. Every day the women are seen hard at work\r\npicking dock leaves and storing them in baskets for the cows at\r\nmilking time, for they will not be milked unless they are fed. The\r\nsheep on Soa Island are plucked instead of being sheared, at the time\r\nwhen the wool would naturally be shed, and what wool will not come\r\noff in this way is cut off with a pocket knife. When the steamer with\r\nMr. Kearton reached the island, no one came down to meet it till the\r\nwhistle had been blown two or three times. \"It was not etiquette to\r\nrush down like a parcel of savages,\" but the people \"retire to tidy\r\nthemselves, and then row out and call in proper form.\"\r\n\r\n=The Island of Sakhalin.=--Mr. Benjamin Howard, an English visitor at\r\nthe recent meeting of the American Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science, presented before Section E of that body an interesting\r\naccount of the great but little-known island of Sakhalin, more\r\ngenerally spelled Saghalien in our geographies. Mr. Howard, however,\r\nstrongly urged the former spelling, as most correctly representing\r\nthe name, which is always pronounced by the Russians in three\r\nsyllables, with the accent on the first. It is now used as a penal\r\ncolony by the Russian Government, and a more hopelessly remote and\r\ninaccessible spot for such a purpose can hardly be found. To it are\r\nsent the hardest cases among the Siberian prisoners; and Mr. Howard\r\nspoke of becoming accustomed, during his stay there, to meeting\r\nscarcely any human beings but murderers, except, of course, the\r\nguards and officials. The island is extremely inaccessible; there\r\nis no commerce, and neither inducement nor opportunity for vessels\r\nto touch there, while much of the coast is ice-bound for a large\r\npart of the year. Mr. Howard, who was engaged in some scientific\r\nwork on the island in the service of the Government, is one of\r\nthe very few foreigners who have traveled or resided there at\r\nall. He predicts for Sakhalin, however, a future of considerable\r\nimportance ultimately, though only after a long period of preliminary\r\ndevelopment and exploitation as a penal colony, which stage has but\r\nlately been begun. It has forest and mining resources--among the\r\nlatter, coal; the deposits are near the surface, but thus far have\r\nbeen very little examined. He was unable to give any data as to\r\ntheir geological age or actual extent; but the Government will no\r\ndoubt soon make investigations. The most remarkable possibilities,\r\nhowever, are in the line of fisheries, the coasts swarming with fish\r\nto an extent that is scarcely credible by one who has not seen them.\r\nMr. Howard said jocosely that he would hardly dare to relate what he\r\nhad personally witnessed, in view of the usual reputation of \"fish\r\nstories.\" The climate is of course rigorous, under the influence of\r\ncold northern currents, and markedly in contrast with that of the\r\nsame latitude on the American side of the Pacific, where the Japan\r\ncurrent carries its modifying influence as the Gulf Stream does to\r\nnorthern Europe. Some agriculture, however, is possible during the\r\nshort summer, and the penal colonists have made fair beginnings\r\nof self-support. He referred further to a remnant of native Aino\r\npopulation as very interesting from the fact that they have preserved\r\ntheir peculiarities of life and manners, and their purity of stock,\r\nmuch more completely through their isolation than the Ainos of the\r\nJapanese Islands, who have been modified more or less by association\r\nwith the latter people.\r\n\r\n=Technical and Popular Names.=--In a paper criticising the\r\nmultiplication of local names in geology, Prof. C. E. Keyes\r\ndistinguishes between names devised with a conscientious desire to\r\nbetter the condition of a science by clothing the new ideas with\r\nsimple words and those which are the product of a name-making mania.\r\n\"The first can not be too highly commended, nor the second too deeply\r\ndeplored.\" Every progressive science must discard the names that have\r\nserved their purpose, and must be prepared to receive all of the\r\nnew ones demanded. The sciences have each two phases, for each of\r\nwhich a terminology is demanded, in one of which the names must be\r\ntechnical and special, established primarily for the investigator,\r\nand in the other general, popular, simple, and free from technical\r\nappearance; but the distinction is rarely made. Those who object to\r\nthe prevalence of technical names in other sciences seldom reflect\r\nthat they have them in their own art. Yet if a man of science should\r\ndesire to familiarize himself with the artisan's work, \"he would be,\r\nafter five minutes' talk with a machinist or electrician, confronted\r\nby so many unfamiliar terms--technical terms of everyday use--that\r\nhe would at once cry out for greater simplicity of language.\" In the\r\ngeological sciences the technicalities play the same part they do in\r\nthe arts and in business. Every new name in geology, however, must be\r\nproperly defined before it can be noticed, and its subsequent career\r\nwill depend on its utility. It may be said that no greater boon to\r\nthe working geologist has been devised than the plan of designating\r\ngeographically geological units irrespective of exact position or\r\nage. Since its adoption a vast mass of valuable information has been\r\nobtained that was previously unthought of, and is in a shape to be\r\nalways used; the other departments of geology have been much aided,\r\nand stratigraphical geology has been greatly helped.\r\n\r\n=The Origin of a Curious Habit.=--The following paragraphs are taken\r\nfrom a recent Nature. It is well known that the kea, or mountain\r\nparrot of New Zealand, has acquired the habit of attacking sheep, and\r\nmaking holes by means of its sharp and powerful beak in the backs of\r\nthese animals for the purpose of abstracting the kidney fat, which\r\nappears to be esteemed as a luxurious diet. It is supposed that this\r\npeculiar habit or instinct was developed by the bird getting the fat\r\nfrom the skins of sheep that had been slaughtered, but this solution\r\nis not very satisfactory, as there appears nothing to connect the fat\r\non the skins of sheep with the live animals. In a note published in\r\nthe Zoölogist (May 16th), Mr. F. R. Godfrey, writing from Melbourne,\r\noffers the following solution of the mystery, which seemed to him\r\nto be simple and satisfactory, and more rational than the sheepskin\r\ntheory: In the hilly districts of the middle island of New Zealand\r\nthere is a great abundance of a white moss, or lichen, which exactly\r\nresembles a lump of white wool, at the roots of which are found\r\nsmall white fatty substances, supposed by some to be the seeds of\r\nthe plant, and by others to be a grub or maggot which infests it,\r\nwhich is the favorite food of the kea. Probably the bird, misled by\r\nthis resemblance, commenced an exploration in sheep, and this proving\r\nsatisfactory, originated the new habit. In a note to this suggestion\r\nthe editor points out that Mr. Godfrey is in agreement with another\r\nobserver--Mr. F. R. Chapman--who in describing the hills of this\r\nisland says: \"A very interesting _raoulia_, or vegetable sheep, was\r\nvery plentiful on steep, rocky places.... It is said that the keas\r\ntear them up with their powerful beaks, and that these birds learned\r\nto eat mutton through mistaking dead sheep for masses of _raoulia_.\"\r\n\r\n=Changes in Plant Characters.=--From experiments upon the cultural\r\nevolution of _Cyclamen latifolium_, W. T. Thiselton Dyer finds\r\nthat, when once specific stability has been broken down in a plant,\r\nmorphological changes of great variety and magnitude can be brought\r\nabout in a comparatively short space of time. It appears that though\r\nsudden variations do occur, they are, as far as we know, slight\r\nas long as self-fertilization is adhered to. The striking results\r\nobtained by cultivators have been due to the patient accumulation\r\nby selection of gradual but continuous variation in any desired\r\ndirection. The size which any variable organ can reach does not\r\nappear to be governed by any principle of correlation. Large flowers\r\nare not necessarily accompanied by large leaves. The general tendency\r\nof a plant varying freely under artificial conditions seems to be\r\natavistic--or to shed adaptive modifications which have ceased to be\r\nuseful, and to revert to a more generalized type, or to reproduce\r\ncharacters which are already present in other members of the same\r\ngroup. But this statement must be accepted with caution. The most\r\nremarkable phenomenon in the cultivation of the _Cyclamen_ is the\r\ndevelopment of a plume or crest on the inner surface of each corolla\r\nsegment. This shows that the plant still possesses the power to\r\nstrike out a new line and to develop characters which would even be\r\nregarded as having specific value.\r\n\r\n=Hanging an Elephant.=--One of the elephants in Barnum and Bailey's\r\nshow, having repeatedly shown signs of insubordination and bad\r\ntemper, it was finally decided to kill him. From a note in Nature\r\nwe get the following account of his execution: After considerable\r\ndiscussion it was decided to strangle him. A new Manila rope was\r\nloosely wound three times around his neck, and his legs, fully\r\nstridden, were securely chained each to a post firmly driven into\r\nthe ground alongside each limb. The animal was intentionally not\r\nisolated from his fellows, as it was feared that if placed by itself\r\nit would become restive and ill-tempered. The rope surrounding the\r\nbeast's neck had one end secured to three strong pillars in the\r\nground, some distance away and slightly in advance of the fore feet;\r\nand the other, which terminated in a loop, was hooked to a double\r\nseries of pulleys, to the tackle of which ninety men were attached.\r\nWhen all was ready, the slack was gently, quietly, and without any\r\napparent annoyance to the elephant--which kept on eating hay--taken\r\nin till the coils round its neck were just taut. The word was then\r\ngiven, \"Walk away with the rope.\" Amid perfect silence the ninety men\r\nwalked away, without apparently any effort. So noiselessly and easily\r\ndid everything work that, unless with foreknowledge of what was going\r\nto take place, one might have been present without realizing what the\r\nmarch of these men meant. The elephant gave no sign of discomfort\r\neither by trunk or tail. Its fellows standing close by looked on in\r\npachydermatous unconcern, and at the end of exactly thirty seconds\r\nit slowly collapsed and lay down as if of its own accord. There was\r\nabsolutely no struggle and no motion, violent or otherwise, in any\r\npart of the body, nor the slightest indication of pain. In a few\r\nseconds more there was no response obtained by touching the eyeball.\r\nAt the end of thirteen minutes after the order to \"walk away\" the eye\r\nhad become rigid and dim. That no more humane, painless, and rapid\r\nmethod of taking the life of a large animal could be devised was the\r\nopinion of all the experts who witnessed the execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nCount Gleichen relates, in his story of the mission to Menelek, that\r\nbesides the Maria Theresa 1780 dollars, the people of Abyssinia, for\r\nsmall change, use a bar of hard crystallized salt, about ten inches\r\nlong and two inches and a half broad and thick, slightly tapered\r\ntoward the end, five of which go to the dollar at the capital. People\r\nare very particular about the standard of fineness of the currency.\r\n\"If it does not ring like metal when flicked with the finger nail,\r\nor if it is cracked or chipped, they won't take it. It is a token of\r\naffection also, when friends meet, to give each other a lick of their\r\nrespective _amolis_, and in this way the material value of the bar\r\nis also decreased. For still smaller change cartridges are used, of\r\nwhich three go to one salt. It does not matter what sort they are.\r\nSome sharpers use their cartridges in the ordinary way, and then\r\nput in some dust and a dummy bullet to make up the difference, or\r\nelse they take out the powder and put the bullet in again, so that\r\npossibly in the next action the unhappy seller will find that he has\r\nonly miss-fires in his belt; but this is such a common fraud that no\r\none takes any notice of it, and a bad cartridge seems to serve as\r\nreadily as a good one.\"\r\n\r\nA study of problems in the Psychology of Reading, by J. O. Quantz,\r\nbore upon the questions of the factors which make a rapid reader, the\r\nrelations of rapidity to mental capacity and alertness, quickness\r\nof visual perception, and amount of practice; and whether those who\r\ngain their knowledge principally through the eye or through the ear\r\nobtain and retain most from reading. The author finds that colors\r\nare more easily perceived than geometrical forms, isolated words\r\nthan colors, and words in construction than disconnected words; that\r\npersons of visual type are slightly more rapid readers than those of\r\nthe auditory type; that rapid readers, besides doing their work in\r\nless time, do superior work, retaining more of the substance of what\r\nis read and heard than do slow readers. Lip movement is a serious\r\nhindrance to speed, and consequently to intelligence, of reading.\r\nThe disadvantage extends to reading aloud. Apart from external\r\nconditions, such as time of day, physical fatigue, etc., some of\r\nthe influences contributing to rapidity of reading are largely\r\nphysiological, as visual perception; others are of mental endowment,\r\nas alertness of mind; still others are matters of intellectual\r\nequipment rather than intellectual ability, as extent of reading and\r\nscholarly attainment.\r\n\r\nMr. Merton L. Miller, of the University of Chicago, says, in his\r\npreliminary study of the Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico, that he was\r\nhampered in his researches there by a circumstance that illustrates\r\nvery well certain characteristics of the Indian. About fifteen\r\nyears ago representatives of the Government were at Sia making\r\ninvestigations, and had to ask many questions. Some time after they\r\nwent away there was much sickness in the pueblo, and many people\r\ndied. It occurred to the Sia people that the presence of those white\r\nmen, asking so many questions, was the cause of all their trouble; so\r\nthey sent men to the other pueblos to warn them against white men who\r\ncame to find out about their customs and beliefs. These messengers\r\nalso came to Taos, and the people remembered their warning well. If\r\na Taos Indian is caught now teaching the language or telling any of\r\nthe traditions to a white man, he is liable to a whipping and a fine.\r\nThis, Mr. Miller believes, accounts for the fact that he could rarely\r\nlearn anything from his friend when they were at the pueblo, although\r\nwhen away in the mountains he became much more open and communicative.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nThe cigarette has found friends. The Truth about Cigarettes embodies\r\nthe substance of papers read and discussed at the Medico-legal\r\nSociety of New York. The gist of the papers is to the effect that\r\nthe stories of harm done by cigarettes are fictions or gross\r\nexaggerations; that they contain no opium, arsenic, or other poisons,\r\nbut are the best pure tobacco (1.0926 grammes each) wrapped in pure\r\npaper (0.038 gramme); that they never caused a case of insanity; and\r\nthat they are simply injurious in the same way and to a corresponding\r\nextent as other forms of tobacco. These statements are supported\r\nby certificates of physicians and by reviews of special cases of\r\ninsanity charged to cigarettes, showing that the insanity had matured\r\nindependently of them.\r\n\r\nThe average annual temperature at Manila is given by Mr. W. F. R.\r\nPhillips, in a paper on the subject, as 80° F. April, May, and\r\nJune are the hottest months, May being the hottest of the three,\r\nand December and January are the coolest. The highest thermometer\r\nreading recorded is 100° F. in May, and the lowest 74° in January.\r\nThe average annual rainfall is 75.43 inches, more than 80 per cent\r\nof which descends in the months from June to October, inclusive.\r\nDepartures from the average rainfall are sometimes excessive. For\r\nexample, as much as 120.98 inches have fallen in one year, and as\r\nlittle as 35.65 inches in another. Still more remarkable were the\r\nfall of 61.43 inches in one September, and that of only two inches in\r\nanother September.\r\n\r\nAt the observatory of Yale University, as we learn from the annual\r\nreport, a planned series of twelve measures each has been completed\r\nfor eighty-four stars of large, proper motion, with a view to\r\ndeterminations of parallax, and it is expected shortly to bring the\r\nnumber up to one hundred. A series of measures on highly colored\r\nred stars has been begun, and is in progress for the purpose of\r\ntesting the possibility of a systematic error due to the lesser\r\nrefrangibility of their light. The photographic instrument has been\r\nput into use at every suitable period of meteorological displays of\r\nconsequence. Preparations are already making for a more complete\r\nobservation of the Leonid meteoric shower expected in 1899.\r\n\r\nThe New York State College of Forestry, in connection with Cornell\r\nUniversity, was presented by Professor Fernow, at the Boston meeting\r\nof the American Association, as a logical sequence to the policy to\r\nwhich the State of New York was committed in 1885 by the purchase of\r\nmore than a million acres of forest land in the Adirondack Mountains,\r\nto be gradually increased to three million acres. A demonstration\r\narea of thirty thousand acres in the Adirondacks has since been\r\nprovided for it. The courses leading to the degree of Bachelor in\r\nForestry occupy four years, of which the first two are devoted to\r\nthe studies in which mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology,\r\nbotany, entomology, political economy, etc., figure as fundamental\r\nand supplementary sciences, in addition to the professional courses;\r\nbesides which two courses of a more or less popular character are\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nThe discovery is announced in a preliminary communication by Dr.\r\nIssutschenko, of Russia, of a microbe pathogenic to rats. An epidemic\r\nhaving broken out among the rats kept for experimental purposes in\r\nthe Government Agricultural Laboratory, a bacillus was isolated from\r\nthe liver and spleen of affected animals that proved excessively\r\nfatal to rats and mice. Experiments in making the organism useful as\r\na living rat poison have not yet, however, had an encouraging success.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand has just definitely adopted a scheme of old-age pensions.\r\nIn future the New Zealand workingman of sixty-five years of age, who\r\nhas lived a life of honest toil, will be assured an income of one\r\npound a week.\r\n\r\nThe Wilde prize of the French Academy of Sciences has been awarded\r\nby that body to Charles A. Schott, chief of the Computation Division\r\nof the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, for his work on\r\nTerrestrial Magnetism.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors were repaired.
