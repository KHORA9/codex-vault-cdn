It is\r\ncalled _geochronology_, the science of dating events. There are\r\nrelatively few geochronologists, scientists trained in the use of all\r\nkinds of dating methods and in the theories upon which these methods are\r\nbased.\r\n\r\nGeochronologists tell us that there are two major types of clocks: those\r\nthat tick at an absolute rate of speed which can be measured, and those\r\nwhich tick only once in a while. A clock of the first type yields what\r\nis called an _absolute_ date, revealing the number of hours, days,\r\nyears, centuries or millennia since an event occurred. A clock of the\r\nsecond type yields what is called a _relative_ date, placing an event as\r\nbefore or after another event, but does not tell us exactly how far they\r\nare apart in time nor how long ago they occurred.\r\n\r\nDepending upon how accurate his date must be to solve the problem he has\r\nset for himself, the archaeologist will select absolute or relative\r\ndating methods. Often, of course, the type of clock he wishes to use is\r\nnot available, and he must use the next best type. Probably he will try\r\nto use a number of clocks of different kinds on the problem since each\r\nclock will act as a check on the others.\r\n\r\nThe absolute clock utilized most widely in archaeology is the historical\r\nrecord. Men have used calendars for a long time, and have often left\r\nrecords with written dates. On tombstones at a site in old Virginia, on\r\nthe pedestals of statues and other monuments from classical Greece and\r\nRome, on the walls of the tombs of Egyptian kings, dates are clearly\r\ninscribed which can be related to the sites dug into by the\r\narchaeologists. These dates must often be recalculated in terms of the\r\nChristian calendar which we use. Most calendars in use in the\r\nMediterranean, the Near East and China during classical antiquity have\r\nbeen successfully correlated with the one we use today, and a date\r\ninscribed or noted on such sites can be considered in our own terms.\r\nOther calendars, such as those developed in the ancient cultures of the\r\nMaya on the Yucatan Peninsula, have yet to be accurately correlated with\r\nour own. Such calendars can be used on their own terms of course, and a\r\nsite which has an inscription in the Mayan calendar is known to be so\r\nmany years older or younger than another one with a different date in\r\nthat calendar. We speak of such a situation as a _floating chronology_.\r\nThat is, the sequence of events and the number of years which separate\r\nthem are known, but the dates of those events in absolute time are\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]\r\n\r\nTree rings afford another kind of absolute clock, the _dendrological_\r\nmethod. Each year a tree adds a growth ring. Depending on the amount of\r\nwater the tree has available to it for cell growth, the ring will be\r\nwider or narrower. Certain trees whose water requirements are high live\r\nnear streams or other places where their roots can tap a constant supply\r\nof water. Such trees, referred to as _complacent_, have annual rings\r\nwhich are all of about the same width. Other _sensitive_ trees live in\r\nplaces where they must depend almost wholly on rainfall for their water\r\nsupply, as on the slopes of hills or in the clefts of rocks. Such trees\r\nhave annual rings which vary in width depending upon the amount of rain\r\nthey receive. In any given area, especially in arid and semiarid\r\nregions, some years have more rainfall than others. The sensitive trees\r\nwill produce wider rings during years when there is more rainfall and\r\nnarrower rings in years when there is less. Often there are periods of a\r\ndecade or so when all of the sensitive trees will produce the same\r\npattern of ring growth; for example, three years of narrow rings, one\r\nyear of wide, two more of narrow and three more of wide. Such a pattern\r\nis called a _signature_.\r\n\r\nSignatures are the basis of tree ring chronologies. All the trees in a\r\nregion did not begin growing at the same time of course, but every time\r\nthere is a series of years which will produce a signature, all the\r\nsensitive trees still alive will have that signature. Let us say we cut\r\ndown a sensitive tree in 1960 and, by counting back the rings, find\r\nsignatures at 1940-45, 1910-14, 1880-89, 1821-27, 1795-1800 and 1750-58.\r\nNext we recover a beam from an abandoned Spanish Mission built in 1810.\r\nIt happens to be from a sensitive tree, and we can spot the 1795-1800\r\nand the 1750-58 signatures near the outer rings. Now we have two records\r\nwhich can be said to be _crossdated_. Let us assume that the Spanish\r\nMission log give us signatures as far back as 1350. An abandoned Indian\r\npueblo produces a log with signatures crossdating those of the Spanish\r\nMission log and continuing the record back to 1250. Older and older\r\narcheological sites will yield older and older signatures with each log\r\ncrossdating some of the signatures of younger logs.\r\n\r\nAt present we have a tree ring calendar for certain species of trees\r\nextending back to about 100 B.C. This is called a _master tree ring\r\nchronology_. A log from an archaeological site may contain only one or\r\ntwo signatures and be, in itself, a floating chronology, but by\r\ncomparison with the master chronology one can determine the cutting\r\ndate. Having a series of cutting dates for the construction timbers in\r\nan archaeological site yields the probable dates at which the site was\r\nbuilt and occupied.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Diagram to Illustrate Tree Ring Dating. Reproduced\r\n    by special permission from Stallings, “Dating Prehistoric Ruins by\r\n    Tree-Rings.”_]\r\n\r\n  C THIS BEAM CAME FROM AN OLD HOUSE\r\n  B THIS BEAM CAME FROM A HOUSE\r\n  A THIS WAS A LIVING TREE WHEN CUT BY US\r\n  THE RING PATTERNS MATCH AND OVERLAP BACK INTO TIME\r\n  SPECIMENS TAKEN FROM RUINS, WHEN MATCHED AND OVERLAPPED AS INDICATED,\r\n          PROGRESSIVELY EXTEND THE DATING BACK INTO PREHISTORIC TIMES.\r\n\r\nNot all kinds of trees can be used for dendrochronology. Pine, fir and\r\npinyon are the most useful; juniper can sometimes be used. Oak,\r\ncottonwood, willow and others are very difficult to date and frequently\r\ncannot be used at all.\r\n\r\nAnother widely used absolute clock is that based upon the orderly\r\ndecomposition of carbon. This is the _radiocarbon_ or C-14 method of\r\ndating. Molecules of various substances are made up of atoms. We know\r\nnow that not all atoms of a substance are precisely the same. We speak\r\nof _isotopes_ of an atom. To clarify this let us think of the atoms of\r\ncarbon as being made up of a mass of ping-pong balls. Some atoms will\r\nhave more ping-pong balls than others, but all will have enough and in\r\nthe proper order to be carbon atoms. Each of the atoms with 14 ping-pong\r\nballs we shall refer to as the carbon-14 isotope of carbon. There will\r\nbe other isotopes of carbon atoms too.\r\n\r\nThe carbon-14 isotope is about average in life span. It has been\r\ndetermined that in any group of C-14 isotopes half of them will lose two\r\nof their ping-pong balls and become C-12 isotopes in 5,730 years, plus\r\nor minus 40. This is known as the _half-life_ of the C-14 isotope. The\r\n“plus or minus 40” allows for laboratory error in terms of years.\r\n\r\nNow all living things contain carbon atoms, and some of those atoms are\r\nC-14 isotopes. The amount of C-14 isotopes in a living organism quickly\r\nreaches a stable percentage after which there is no increase or decrease\r\nwhile the organism is alive. After it dies, the C-14 supply is not\r\nreplenished, and with the passing of 5,730 plus or minus 40 years, it\r\nhas half the number of C-14 isotopes it had when alive. In 11,460 plus\r\nor minus 80 years, it will have one quarter as many as it had when\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nThe geochronologist takes a certain weight of carbon-bearing matter from\r\nan organism which once lived. With simple chemistry he can determine the\r\nnumber of carbon atoms in the material, usually charcoal, wood, bone or\r\nshell. He places the material in a chamber equipped with geiger counters\r\nand records the number of C-14 isotopes converting to C-12 isotopes\r\nwithin a certain number of hours or days. Since he knows how many carbon\r\natoms there are in the specimen, he knows how many C-14 isotopes there\r\nwould be if the specimen were alive. He also knows that as the number of\r\nC-14 atoms decreases the number of clicks on the geiger counter will\r\ndecrease too. For example, if there are 2,000 C-14 isotopes, the\r\ndecomposition of half of these over a period of approximately 5,730\r\nyears would register 1,000 clicks on the counter. In the next 5,730 year\r\nperiod there would be 1,000 isotopes left, and only 500 of them would\r\ndecompose to register as geiger counter clicks.\r\n\r\nThe geochronologist does the counting and analysis of the results and\r\nsends the information back to the archaeologist in the form of the\r\nnumber of years that have elapsed since the carbon was part of a living\r\ncreature; for example, 1,500 plus or minus 150 years BP (before\r\npresent). The archaeologist, converting this to the Christian calendar\r\nin 1964, would come up with A.D. 464 plus or minus 150 years. When was\r\nthe sample actually alive? We don’t know exactly, but statistically we\r\nhave a ninety-five percent chance of being right if we say sometime\r\nbetween A.D. 164 and 764. This clock ticks in centuries. But the\r\nradiocarbon clock doesn’t tick very long, even in centuries, before\r\nrunning down. By the time 30,000 to 40,000 years have gone by, the C-14\r\nin any sample is almost gone, and there is too little left to give\r\nenough geiger counter clicks unless one is willing to wait a lifetime to\r\nrecord two or three clicks.\r\n\r\nThe C-14 dating technique measures time by radioactive decomposition of\r\nmaterials. There are other clocks which depend on the chemical\r\ndecomposition of materials. The forgery of the Piltdown Man fossil was\r\ndetected by a dating method which depends on the decomposition of bone\r\nprotein and its replacement by fluorine. Fluorine is an element which\r\noccurs naturally as a gas, but which combines readily with other\r\nelements to form compounds. Some of these elements are common in bones.\r\nSince fluorine is one of nature’s most reactive elements, it tends to\r\nescape from the compound it is in and to form other compounds. As the\r\nprotein in a bone decays, it is often replaced by fluorine. The amount\r\nof fluorine in old bones, then, is expected to be more than in young\r\nbones since it has had more time to accumulate. Since fluorine does not\r\naccumulate at a constant rate, it affords only a relative measure of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Piltdown, a group of bones was discovered at a site, and\r\nwas said to contain those of one individual who lived about 60,000 years\r\nago. Almost 100 years after they were discovered, these bones were put\r\nto the fluorine test. It was found that (1) some of the bones had less\r\nfluorine than others, so not all were of the same antiquity and could\r\nnot have belonged to the same individual, (2) the younger bones had as\r\nmuch fluorine in them as modern bones, and (3) the older bones had more\r\nfluorine in them than bones known to be 60,000 years old.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]\r\n\r\nAnother form of absolute dating of importance to archaeology is that\r\ncalled the _varve_ method. This can only be utilized as an absolute\r\nclock under very special circumstances however. Varves are like tree\r\nrings in a way. In a lake which is sufficiently deep, or at the edge of\r\na glacier, particles of sediment are being deposited continuously as a\r\nsort of fallout from the water. During the winter, when the glacier\r\nfreezes or the density of the water in the lake increases because of the\r\ncooler temperature, less particles are deposited, and those which are\r\ndeposited are usually of a characteristic color or texture. During the\r\nsummer, when the glacier melts or the lake warms up, more and different\r\nparticles are deposited. The bands of deposited sediment are called\r\nvarves; every year two varves are formed. Starting from the top, one can\r\ncount back the number of years in a varve series. If the top varve is of\r\nknown date such as the present year, one has a calendar with each varve\r\nhaving a known date. Attempts are made to correlate one varve series\r\nwith another in order to recover even longer series. If the\r\narchaeologist is lucky, and it is not rare in Europe, there will be\r\nmaterials from a site buried in the local varve sequence. Counting back\r\ngives an absolute age for the artifacts embedded in the site and thus an\r\napproximate age for the site. The European varve chronology is believed\r\nto extend back to about 9650 B.C.\r\n\r\nMost of the clocks which the archaeologist uses to produce relative\r\ndates, the before-or-after kind, have as their theoretical basis the\r\nprinciple of _stratigraphy_. In effect the principle of stratigraphy\r\nassumes two things: that the rocks of the earth are constantly wearing\r\ndown by erosion, and that things which appear to be alike actually are\r\nalike and are probably more or less the same age.\r\n\r\nIf rocks are constantly wearing down, it follows that the surface of the\r\nground is constantly building up. Thus the surface we walk on is a\r\nyounger, higher surface than that which our ancestors walked on. When we\r\ndig below the surface, those things we find which are at higher levels\r\nare younger than those which we find at lower levels. The deeper we dig,\r\nthe older things get.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that the rate of deposition on the surface\r\nis the same everywhere. If we dig two feet in one place we may be at a\r\nlevel which is now five feet below the surface in another location. If\r\nwe find a particular object, say a type of pottery, on the surface at\r\nsite A and the same kind of pottery five feet below the surface at site\r\nB, we can use the second of our assumptions and maintain that both\r\npieces are of the same age. Then any objects found at higher levels than\r\nfive feet at site B are younger than the piece of pottery and are\r\nyounger than anything found at site A. This is the principle of\r\nstratigraphy.\r\n\r\nLike tree rings, objects in _stratigraphic sequence_ can be crossdated.\r\nThese sequences may be of various kinds as any object will do.\r\nDistinctive bands of sediment, distinctive artifacts, types of fossils,\r\nspecific details of chemistry or any other phenomenon may be used with\r\nvarying amounts of success. Suppose we have the following sequences of\r\nobjects at sites A and B:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]\r\n\r\n                A                               B\r\n\r\n          _Black earth_                    _Brown dust_\r\n            _Caliche_                     _Black earth_\r\n          _Eroded layer_                    _Caliche_\r\n            _Cobbles_                     _Yellow silt_\r\n              _Soil_                       _Brown silt_\r\n           _Brown silt_                   _Eroded layer_\r\n                                            _Cobbles_\r\n\r\nNow there are some things that are similar about these two _profiles_\r\nand other things that are different. Both profiles contain layers of\r\nblack earth, caliche, an eroded layer and cobbles. Both profiles contain\r\npottery, and both contain arrow points. The type of pottery in profile A\r\nis the same as that in profile B, but in B there is brown dust above the\r\nblack earth. In profile B the brown silt is above the eroded layer,\r\nwhile in A it is below the eroded layer. In profile A the arrow points\r\nhave different shapes than the ones in profile B. What we need to\r\ncorrelate the sequences are _horizon markers_, objects that are enough\r\nalike to be in the same time range.\r\n\r\nThe pots in both cases look the same and are embedded in the same kind\r\nof sediment, the black earth. They form one horizon. The caliche may be\r\na horizon marker, but this is not positive since at profile A it is\r\nabove the eroded layer, while at profile B it is above the yellow silt.\r\nThe eroded layer sits above cobbles at both profiles, which makes the\r\neroded layer-cobbles complex a pretty good horizon marker. The brown\r\nsilt is not a horizon marker because it is above the eroded layer at one\r\nprofile and below it at the other. Furthermore, the arrow points which\r\nit contains are not all of the same kind. The correlated sequence, using\r\nthe horizon markers, must be as shown in the accompanying chart.\r\n\r\nThe stratigraphy proves that the arrowheads in the upper brown silt must\r\nbe younger than those in the lower brown silt. The next time we find\r\narrowheads of the types recovered in the upper brown silt we will know,\r\nregardless of the stratigraphic sequence in the new locality, that they\r\nmust be younger than the types found in the lower brown silt, and they\r\nmust also be older than pottery of the type found in the black earth. We\r\nwon’t know how many years old they are, but we have dated them in the\r\nsense that we know they are older than some things and younger than\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe principle of stratigraphy is one of the archaeologist’s most useful\r\ntheoretical tools as it allows one site to be compared with others. Our\r\nexample has shown how artifacts (pots and arrowheads in this case) and\r\nsediment types can be placed in stratigraphic order to provide a clock\r\nfor archaeological dating. Other objects which are commonly used as\r\nhorizon markers in stratigraphic sequences are fossils. Remains of\r\nextinct animals are often used to prove extreme antiquity. Remains of\r\nplants and animals will often indicate similarity of ecological\r\nconditions at two sites and allow them to be crossdated.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]\r\n\r\n                              _Brown dust_\r\n                             _Black earth_\r\n                               _Caliche_\r\n                             _Yellow silt_\r\n                              _Brown silt_\r\n                             _Eroded layer_\r\n                               _Cobbles_\r\n                                 _Soil_\r\n                              _Brown silt_\r\n\r\nThe _geologic-climatic_ method of dating combines the principle of\r\nstratigraphy with an interpretation of the meaning of natural\r\noccurrences. When geologists demonstrated that the earth had recently\r\ngone through a period when enormous glaciers advanced and retreated\r\nacross the northern and southern hemispheres, they began to speculate on\r\nthe effects of such conditions on the landscape. The surface would be\r\nscraped down to bare rock by the advancing ice sheet. When the ice\r\nretreated, its load of rocks and cobbles would tend to be left behind,\r\nwhile the smaller particles of dirt would be flushed away in the rivers\r\nformed by the melting ice. If the archaeologist found tools among the\r\nboulders and cobbles, those tools should date to the period when the\r\ncobble and boulder stratum was formed, the period when the glacier was\r\nretreating. Here the geology gave clues to the climate, and if the age\r\nof the climatic event was known, artifacts associated with the geology\r\ncould be dated.\r\n\r\nIt is through the geologic-climatic method of dating that archaeologists\r\ndiscovered that human beings lived in southern Europe at the margin of\r\nthe last great glacier, and therefore the date of their occupation was\r\non the order of 20,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to use the geologic aspect of geologic-climatic\r\ndating if one has other clues to the climate. Plant and animal fossils\r\nare clues to ancient climates, since living organisms have a tendency to\r\nlive in climates to which they are best adapted. If we find the fossil\r\nbones of a giraffe or an ostrich in the Sahara Desert, we can conclude\r\nthat at some time in the past the Sahara was not a desert but a veldt,\r\nsince giraffes and ostriches live in the veldt today. If stratigraphy\r\nallows us to relate artifacts to those fossils, we can maintain that the\r\nmakers of those artifacts lived at the time the veldt existed in what is\r\nnow the Sahara area. Now if we can relate the fossils to a date when\r\nsuch a climate could have obtained in the area, we have a date for the\r\nartifacts.\r\n\r\nAnimal fossils are relatively rare, and fossil remains of plants which\r\ncan be seen with the naked eye are even rarer. But microscopic pollen\r\ngrains are not particularly rare in the stratigraphic sequences of\r\nsediments, and are directly associated with artifacts in many kinds of\r\nsediment. The pollen of most plants is protected by a tough coat like\r\nthat on many seeds. Millions of pollen grains are produced by local\r\nvegetation each year, and a percentage of them are buried in the yearly\r\naccumulation of sediment. Once they are buried, the tough outer covering\r\nis preserved.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]\r\n\r\nWhen pollen grains are extracted from their sediment matrix, the\r\ndifferent types of plants which grew in the area at the time the\r\nsediment was laid down can be recognized from the distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of their pollen grains. The _pollen analyst_ has the job\r\nof interpreting this information to discover the nature of the\r\nvegetation patterns in the past and the climates associated with them.\r\nThrough dating those climates, the artifacts with which the pollen\r\nsample was associated are dated.\r\n\r\nSome archaeological sites do not allow dating by any of these methods.\r\nThe farmer plowing a field may pick up an arrowhead and wonder how old\r\nit is. Can the archaeologist date the arrowhead? The answer is a\r\nqualified yes. What the archaeologist will try to do is give an educated\r\nguess as to the age of the arrowhead. He might, for example, know that\r\narrowheads of that type are found at a site which is dated about A.D.\r\n1000 by various methods. By correlation, he could apply that date.\r\n\r\nIf the arrowhead is not of a type which has been reliably dated, the\r\narchaeologist may rely upon the method of dating known as _seriation_.\r\nThis method depends on the second assumption basic to the principle of\r\nstratigraphy, that similar objects tend to be about the same age. The\r\nfarmer’s arrowhead may not be exactly like any which has ever been\r\ndiscovered, but it probably will be more like some known ones than\r\nothers. Observing the general style of the arrowhead and the way in\r\nwhich it is made, the archaeologist can make a pretty good estimate of\r\nwhen it was made.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that the archaeologist goes into an unexplored area where\r\nno absolute or relative dating techniques are available. There he finds\r\na number of sites with potsherds of types new to archaeology. Can he\r\ndate these sites? Again he uses seriation, but this time he inverts the\r\nlogical proposition. If things which look alike tend to be of the same\r\nage, things which do not look alike should tend to be of different ages.\r\n\r\nHis first task would be to separate all the different types of\r\npotsherds. Taking a specimen of each type, he lays them out in a row. If\r\nthere is any difference in the sites through time, the styles of pottery\r\nwill change correspondingly. But there will be some styles which change\r\nslowly and some which will influence others. For example, if we were to\r\nseriate the style of automobile rear fenders for the period 1956 to\r\n1964, we would observe that they began to sprout taller and taller fins;\r\nthen the size of the fins became reduced more and more. Some of the\r\nstyle aspects of pre-1956 rear fenders went along with the development\r\nof fins and others dropped out. Some of the style aspects which were\r\ndeveloped with the fins were retained after the fins decreased in size.\r\n\r\nSeriation of the design styles on the potsherds will result in a series\r\nof developments in style which are probably in chronological order.\r\nBroad straight line designs may give way to mixed broad and narrow\r\nstraight lines, then to narrow straight lines, then to narrow wavy\r\nlines. The archaeologist could then maintain that sites which have\r\npotsherds with broad straight lines are separate in time from those with\r\nsherds having narrow wavy lines. He won’t know which is the older,\r\nbecause the sequence could work either way. Stratigraphy or the cultural\r\nsimilarity between other artifacts at the sites will probably resolve\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\nThe reader will now have realized that many of the clocks used by\r\narchaeologists are interrelated. Relative dating clocks such as\r\nstratigraphy, pollen dating and geologic-climatic dating are utilized\r\ntogether where possible, and all are dependent upon the principle of\r\nstratigraphy. Crossdating is thus of vital importance and is constantly\r\nundertaken. The archaeologist tries to employ both absolute and relative\r\nclocks to find out the age of a site. Stratigraphy yields a series of\r\nrelative dates for artifacts within the site; geologic-climatic and\r\npollen dating yield a series of dates for types of sediment and samples\r\ncollected in association with those artifacts; tree ring dates yield the\r\nabsolute age of the site which allows the pollen, stratigraphic and\r\ngeologic-climatic dates to be comprehended in terms of absolute age.\r\nRadiocarbon dates act as a check on the tree ring dates and, if they\r\nagree, lend support to the pollen and geologic-climatic dates. The\r\npollen and geologic-climatic dates from the site are compared with\r\nsimilar dates from other sites as additional checks. Since the clocks\r\nused by the archaeologist tick at different rates of speed, and since\r\nnot all of them are dating the same thing, the archaeologist usually\r\nends with a series of dates for any given site.\r\n\r\nNew geochronological techniques are always being invented and perfected.\r\nHere is a list of some that are expected to become available in the next\r\nfew years:\r\n\r\n1. The _obsidian hydration_ method. Obsidian, a naturally formed glass,\r\nis so constituted chemically that it takes chemicals from its\r\nenvironment at a slow rate. As it does so, the outside layer changes\r\nfrom transparent to translucent or opaque. The depth of the opaque\r\nlayer, it is hoped, can be used as a measure of the amount of time since\r\nthe surface was exposed. As many artifacts were made by chipping\r\nobsidian to form a sharp edge, this method may reveal the time since an\r\nobsidian artifact was made.\r\n\r\n2. The _thermoluminescence_ method. The chemical properties of certain\r\nminerals change when the minerals are heated to high temperatures. If\r\nthey are heated again they will glow, and the amount of time they glow\r\nupon reheating depends on the amount of time that has elapsed since they\r\nwere heated originally. As yet the rate has not been accurately\r\ncalculated, nor is it yet understood what effect different kinds of\r\nsoils and atmospheres may have on this rate. If the method is proven, it\r\nwill be invaluable to archaeology since it will afford a way of dating\r\npottery directly on an absolute time scale.\r\n\r\n3. The _paleomagnetism_ method. When an object containing particles\r\nwhich can be magnetized is heated, the magnetic particles line up\r\naccording to the earth’s magnetic field. When the object cools, the\r\nparticles are trapped in this position. We know that the earth’s\r\nmagnetic field is changeable, and that at different times it has been\r\noriented in different directions. Work is now in progress to determine\r\nhow the field has varied through time and how successfully one can date\r\nmaterials such as pottery or hearths which were exposed to high\r\ntemperatures in the past by the difference between the present magnetic\r\nfield and that trapped in the object.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Museum of New Mexico Press\r\n                            Santa Fe    1965\r\n\r\n                     _Illustrations by Mary Spencer\r\n                          and Phyllis Hughes_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
