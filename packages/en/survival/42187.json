PAUL, MINNESOTA, JANUARY, 1879.\r\n  THE PIONEER PRESS CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe increase in the number of our Catholic Colonies in Minnesota, and\r\nthe changes which population and other causes have brought about, make\r\nit necessary to publish a revised edition of the Immigration Pamphlet,\r\nissued by the Catholic Colonization Bureau of Minnesota, in 1877.\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to notice the increased interest which is manifested all\r\nover the country, by Catholics, in the matter of Catholic immigration\r\nfrom the cities to the land.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy, aid, and words of cheer, we are continually receiving from\r\nfriends totally unconnected with our local work, assure us of this\r\npleasing fact; which we attribute, in a great measure, to the honest,\r\nintelligent advocacy, and generous support our Catholic newspapers have\r\ngiven to the question.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, we are glad to gratefully acknowledge the liberal support\r\nthe Catholic editors have given to our work: the confidence which they\r\nplaced, from the very beginning, in the purity of our motives and the\r\nsoundness of our business arrangements, is an indorsement of which we\r\nare justly proud.\r\n\r\nThey have recognized that our aim is to do good to the many; and in all\r\ncases where our advice has been taken, our instructions followed, our\r\nwarnings heeded, we do not fear that we have injured one.\r\n\r\nThe approbation of our co-religionists, conveyed to us from all parts of\r\nthe country, the success which God has been pleased to give to our\r\nhumble labors, are cheering guarantees that we are on the right road;\r\nand we pray God that He will continue to bless our efforts, enlighten us\r\nin our present task, and keep our ardor in the cause we have espoused\r\nstrictly within the bounds of truth.\r\n\r\nIt is an axiom that \"they who own the soil own the country.\"\r\n\r\nHappily, in this country, the people's title to the land is recognized,\r\nthey are invited to take possession of their own, and the tall,\r\nluxuriant grasses of the broad prairie are the messengers it sends forth\r\nfrom its virgin bosom, telling of the wealth it has in store to reward\r\nhonest, patient labor.\r\n\r\nThere is no angry contest here for the possession of the soil, but there\r\nis, and should be, a noble, wise emulation among the various races that\r\nhave emigrated to these shores, for their just portions of it. The\r\nsurplus populations in our cities, the depression of business, the\r\nscarcity of employment, the poverty, suffering and discontent attending\r\nthereon, the magnitude of labor strikes, and the dread of their\r\nrepetition, have made the question of immigration to the land from our\r\nover-crowded cities of pressing, national interest. The policy of our\r\npeople immigrating in large numbers to the lands of the West, is no\r\nlonger a theory to discuss, but a necessity, calling for the active\r\nsupport of every good, intelligent Catholic.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to review the many causes which have heretofore\r\nretarded the immigration of our people to the land. Among those causes\r\nwas one which should endear them to every Catholic heart, and which\r\nstands out in bright contrast to the irreligious indifference of the\r\nage.\r\n\r\n_They feared that if they came West, they would be beyond the reach of\r\nchurch and priest._\r\n\r\nThe danger of a Catholic settling in any of the Western States now, and\r\nfinding himself entirely isolated, by distance, from his church, is\r\nscarcely to be apprehended, for the West has now its handsome churches,\r\nits priests and Catholic schools; but it might come to pass, that coming\r\nundirected, and without any Catholic organization to which he might\r\napply, the Catholic immigrant might find himself settled in a locality\r\ninconveniently distant from church and priest, and where he and his\r\nfamily would be separated from Catholic associations.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, the religious welfare of those coming to our\r\ncolonies, was one of the main features to which Bishop Ireland devoted\r\nhis attention when organizing the Catholic Colonization Bureau. Before\r\nthe arrival of any of our immigrants, the rule was established that\r\nwhenever we opened a colony and invited our people to it, the resident\r\npriest and church should go in with our first settlers, be their number\r\nsmall or large. To this good rule we attribute, to a great extent, not\r\nalone our success in bringing settlers to our colonies, but likewise\r\ntheir general contentment in their new homes and brave cheerfulness in\r\nmeeting the trials, hardships, and set-backs, which are incident to new\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nNo question is so frequently asked by our correspondents as, \"How near\r\ncan I get land to a Catholic Church?\" In no portion of any of the\r\nCatholic Colonies of Minnesota, established by the Catholic Bureau,\r\nunder the auspices of the Right Rev. Bishop Ireland, shall a settler\r\nfind himself beyond the easy reach of church and priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n     ADVANTAGES OF AGRICULTURAL LIFE OVER CITY LIFE, TO THE MAN WHO\r\n     MAKES HIS LIVING BY THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW.\r\n\r\n     INDEPENDENCE ON THE LAND.\r\n\r\n     GENERAL PROSPERITY OF CATHOLIC SETTLEMENTS IN\r\n     MINNESOTA.--INDIVIDUAL PROSPERITY.\r\n\r\n     WHAT OUR EARLY SETTLERS HAD TO GO THROUGH--HOW THEY GOT THROUGH IT\r\n     AND CAME OUT AT THE TOP OF THE HEAP.\r\n\r\n     THEIR BRAVE BATTLE FOR INDEPENDENCE--THEIR BOUNTIFUL REWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"It's na' to hide it in a hedge;\r\n      It's na' for train attendant;\r\n  But for the glorious privilege\r\n      Of being independent.\"\r\n\r\nThus sung Robert Burns long ago in praise of independence. This is one\r\nof the rewards which the land holds out to the honest, hard-working,\r\npersevering settler; and never does it break its promise to industry and\r\nperseverance.\r\n\r\nIn the city, dangers surround the poor laboring man; temptations arise\r\non every side to drag him down; insurmountable barriers oppose his\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nWell, he may avoid the dangers--we wish to give the best view of the\r\ncase, and, thank God, there are thousands of instances to sustain\r\nit--spurn the temptations, and even surmount some of the outward\r\nbarriers to his advancement. He may be respectably housed and clothed;\r\nhe may have a good boss. Ah, there is the rub, good or bad--\r\n\r\n\r\nHE HAS A BOSS,\r\n\r\na man at whose nod he must come and go. He may have money in a savings\r\nbank honestly managed; but if a spell of sickness prostrates him, how\r\nmuch of his hard-earned savings will be left when he rises from his sick\r\nbed? And suppose he feels that he has his death sickness, can you, by\r\ngoing into sorrow's counting-house, attempt to estimate the agony of the\r\npoor Catholic parent when he thinks of the fate which may await his\r\nchildren, left fatherless in a sinful city?\r\n\r\nThere are other pictures of a poor man's city life, which we care not to\r\ndraw. But we will take this prosperous workingman, with a good boss,\r\nfrom the city, and place him in his first rude house on his own land. He\r\nmisses many things, many comforts. He misses the society of friends who\r\nused to come round from time to time--the milkman's bell, the butcher's\r\ncart: everything was so handy in the city.\r\n\r\nHe is lonely: a feeling of desolation comes over him as he stands at the\r\ndoor of his new home, and looks around at the unimproved land. The land\r\nis rich and good, and the scene is fair to look at; but the reality is\r\nso different from the mental picture he made before setting out for the\r\nWest, that he feels sad and disappointed. Then as he looks around him\r\n_at his own_,\r\n\r\n\r\nHE MISSES THE BOSS.\r\n\r\nAt the thought, the spirit of independence which has led this man\r\nthousands of miles, perhaps, to seek a new home, and which sadness and\r\ndisappointment--the first effects of a great change--for awhile subdued,\r\nleaps in his heart, and sends the red blood surging through his veins.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO BOSS.\r\n\r\nHis eyes grow bright with pride as he looks out upon the land, a wide\r\ncircle of which he calls his own.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOSS HAS DISAPPEARED,\r\n\r\nAnd the man, the owner of a wide stretch of real estate, conscious of a\r\ngreat awaking of self-respect in his being, stands erect at the door of\r\nhis own house, on his own property, and feels that no one better than he\r\nis, shall pass him by all day.\r\n\r\nHow the consciousness of independence, the feeling of self-respect, will\r\nsustain this man through many hardships, disappointments and trials!\r\n\r\nIn a short time one or two cows take the place of the dingy cans of the\r\nmilkman, and some young grunters in the hog pen represent the\r\nmeat-market.\r\n\r\nAfter some years are past we visit the scene again. There is no\r\nloneliness here now, for it is harvest time, and the farmer and his sons\r\nare busy in the fields, his wife and eldest daughters busy in the house\r\npreparing for the keen appetites the men will bring in with them. The\r\nfirst rude shanty has given place to a nice two-story frame house, well\r\nsheltered from sun and wind by the healthy young trees the farmer\r\nplanted with his own hands, and in the rear are the snug barn and\r\ngranary.\r\n\r\nWhere once the wild prairie grass waved, comes the cheery clatter of the\r\nharvester, and swath after swath of the golden grain falls down before\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBy and by the younger children return from school, rosy and hungry, and\r\na small skirmisher is thrown out and enters the pantry; he is repulsed\r\nand falls back on the main body; then, taking advantage of the \"good\r\nwoman,\" being obliged to run to the oven to keep the bread from burning,\r\nthe whole force advance, a pie is spiked and carried off in triumph.\r\n\r\nAs the shades of evening fall, a herd of cattle march lazily into the\r\nfarm yard, and then from the field come the farmer and his sons. Lonely,\r\nindeed! Why the noise of Babel is renewed here. Dipping his hot face in\r\na basin of cool water, the farmer splutters out his directions; seizing\r\na jack towel, he scrubs his face, and continues to halloo to Mike, and\r\nTom, and Patrick. Why, _the boss has come back_. Ay, but\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN HIMSELF IS THE BOSS NOW.\r\n\r\nAll things come to an end, so does the farmer's supper; and as we sit\r\nwith him on the porch outside we say,\r\n\r\n\"You have a splendid place here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will do,\" he answers quite carelessly; but he can't fool us. We know\r\nthat he is proud of his success.\r\n\r\n\"I had to work hard for it,\" he continues, \"but God has been very good\r\nto us.\"\r\n\r\nWe are not romancing. We have drawn a picture from the original, which\r\ncan be duplicated a thousand fold in this State.\r\n\r\nIt is not individual success alone we can point to, but likewise the\r\nsuccess of whole farming communities, where the people commenced\r\npoor--many of them, perhaps the majority, with scarcely any means at\r\nall--under disadvantages that would now appear to us, with railroads and\r\nmarkets on every side, almost insurmountable, and where to-day we cannot\r\nfind one exceptional case of failure without an exceptional cause for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThoroughly acquainted with the Catholic settlements in Minnesota, we\r\ncannot call to mind a case where a hard-working, industrious, sober man\r\nfailed to make a comfortable home for his family. We know of many cases\r\nwhere such a man met with reverses, lost his crop, his cattle, his\r\nhorses; but never a case where a man met his reverses with a brave heart\r\nand trust in God, that he did not overcome them, and come out of the\r\nbattle a better and prouder man.\r\n\r\nLet a poor man in the city find his all swept away from him, and what\r\ndoes he do? He slinks into its alleys and lanes, his pleasant, decent\r\nrooms are changed for one foul room in a tenement house, from whence,\r\nafter a little, charity carries him to a pauper's grave.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the general prosperity of our Catholic settlements in\r\nMinnesota, and we have not to travel far from its capital to find some\r\nof them--only into the adjoining county, Dakota, one of the very finest\r\nin the State.\r\n\r\nFully two-thirds of the lands of the county are owned (mind, _owned_.)\r\nby Catholic settlers, Irish and German.\r\n\r\nSome twenty-five years ago, a few poor Irishmen settled in the timber in\r\nthis county. It was very generally supposed, at that time, that people\r\ncould not live on a prairie in Minnesota; but by and by, those who had\r\nsettled in Dakota county found out their mistake, and commenced making\r\nclaims on the adjoining prairie, Rosemount prairie, to-day the garden of\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nBut not before Hugh Derham, of the County Meath, Ireland, now the\r\nHonorable Hugh Derham, came along and put up his shanty on the prairie.\r\n\"I had seven hundred dollars,\" he said to us some time ago, \"when I came\r\non here; oxen were dear then, and when I had a yoke bought, together\r\nwith a cow, and my shanty up, I had little or none of the money left.\r\nBut I went to work, broke up all the land I could, got seed, put in my\r\nfirst crop, and lost every kernel of it.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day this man owns four hundred acres of improved land, in a circle\r\nround his house. Fifty dollars an acre would be a low value to put on\r\nhis land. Some four years ago his neighbor, a man of the name of Ennis,\r\nbought one hundred and twenty acres of land adjoining, for something\r\nlike ten thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen Hugh Derham settled here there was not a railroad nearer than two\r\nhundred miles of him, now passengers on the Milwaukee and St. Paul\r\nRailroad, passing within half a mile in front of his house, point from\r\nthe windows of the cars to his place, as a model home of a thrifty\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nHis handsome, two-story frame house stands embowered in the orchard and\r\nshade trees, sturdy Hugh Derham planted with his own hands; his barn\r\nalone cost three thousand dollars; he has flocks of sheep, herds of\r\ncattle, and horses as he requires them; and he has a good wife, who\r\nassisted him in his early struggles, healthy, fresh and handsome still.\r\nHe has had his eldest daughter at a convent school, and bought for her\r\nlast year a five hundred dollar piano. It is said that he has some ten\r\nthousand dollars loaned out at interest.\r\n\r\nNow, is Hugh Derham's an exceptional case?\r\n\r\nIf you came along, and we were inclined to brag, and show you a specimen\r\nof our Catholic farmers in Minnesota, we would bring you direct to Hugh\r\nDerham, not for his herds, and stock, and well filled granary--he is\r\nsurpassed by many of our farmers in all these--but for the look of\r\nrespectable thriftiness all around him. There is his next neighbor, Wm.\r\nMurphy, another well-to-do, respectable farmer, not perhaps as well off\r\nas Derham, but still able to bear some time ago a loss of five thousand\r\ndollars by fire, and to make no poor mouth about it. Another neighbor,\r\nMich. Johnson, a prosperous man, better still, a high spirited, fine\r\nfellow, and an earnest worker in the cause of temperance. Another\r\nneighbor, Tom Hiland, as rich a man as Derham. In the next township, the\r\nBennetts--three or four brothers that a poor but good, intelligent,\r\nwidowed mother, with much struggling, managed to bring West, and locate\r\non government land. These brothers now farm five times as much land as\r\nDerham, and raise five times as much wheat.\r\n\r\nAnd as we have been led into giving individual cases of success,--not at\r\nfirst intended, for such cases must be always in certain features more\r\nor less exceptional--we will give one more, that of Mich. Whalen of\r\nWhalen township, Fillmore county.\r\n\r\nHis history is a remarkable one, as told by himself to us; remarkable in\r\nhis brave struggle for independence, his sagacity, and final success. We\r\ngive some points:\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago Mich. Whalen landed from Ireland in New York. He\r\nwas then forty years of age, and had a wife and eight children--all his\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nYes, his wealth, he thought, if he could but reach with them the broad\r\nacres of the West.\r\n\r\nSo he sawed wood for seventy-five cents a cord in the city of New York:\r\nthe more he sawed the less he liked the work, and making a brave effort\r\nhe found himself, with wife and children, squatted on one hundred and\r\nsixty acres of government land in Fillmore county, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nWhen the land came into market he was not able to pay the government\r\nprice, one dollar and twenty-five cents an acre, but Capt. McKenney, the\r\nthen receiver of the U. S. Land Office, managed to give him time, and\r\nthe next year's crop enabled him to pay up. At this time John, his\r\neldest of six sons, was sixteen years of age, and able to help his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nTo-day Mich. Whalen is the owner of thirteen hundred acres of land in\r\nFillmore county. The village of Whalen with mills and a fine water\r\npower, is on his land: or rather, on the land of his son John, for as\r\nthe boys get married the old man gives them title to portions of the\r\nland, on which they build. There is another mill within a few rods of\r\nthe old homestead, and there is not less than from six thousand to ten\r\nthousand bushels of wheat raised on the farm each year.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Whalen,\" said a friend some time ago, \"you got on splendidly;\r\nwith such a large and almost helpless family at the beginning, I don't\r\nsee how you could have managed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We put our trust in God, _avourneen_!\" replied the old man, \"and we\r\nstuck together.\"\r\n\r\nWhere were the special advantages in this man's case; which enabled the\r\npoor wood-sawyer of New York to become one of the solid men of a rich\r\ncounty?\r\n\r\nThey are to be found in the fact that he was blessed with good children,\r\nwho, as they grew up and became able to help him, remained at home and\r\ndid help--and amply are they rewarded for it to day--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THEY STUCK TOGETHER.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is of the general prosperity of our Catholic settlements in\r\nMinnesota that we wish more particularly to speak, for as a general rule\r\nthere is no business which has not its representative successful men.\r\n\r\nDakota County being close to the capital of the State, (St. Paul,) and\r\npossessing the advantage of having, on the Mississippi River, a market\r\nfor its produce, at a time when there was not a mile of railroad in the\r\nState, was settled up at an early day. Among its settlers were Irish and\r\nGerman Catholics. From that period out these settlers have not alone\r\nheld their own, but, year after year receiving fresh additions to their\r\nnumbers, they have advanced from township to township, buying improved\r\nfarms and wild land, until, as we have stated before, two-thirds of the\r\nlands of the county belong to them.\r\n\r\nTravel which side you will, and you shall find evidence that one \"can\r\nread as he runs\" of their prosperity, intelligence and respectability;\r\nhandsome houses, good offices, young orchards, ornamental planting, and\r\nthe grand big wheat fields around, which have supplied the means to\r\nbuild up those pleasant homes.\r\n\r\nTraveling along down the Mississippi to the eastern boundary of the\r\nState and taking a wide range of country on the Minnesota side of the\r\nriver, we find many prosperous settlements of our people. Again\r\nsouthwest, up the beautiful valley of the Minnesota River, in Scott,\r\nSibley, Le Sueur, Nicollet and Blue Earth counties, there are numerous\r\nCatholic settlements, both in the woods and on the prairie. So, too, in\r\nthe midland counties of Rice, Steele, Waseca, Olmsted, Dodge and Mower\r\ncounties, our people are settled, prosperous and happy, their valuable\r\nfarms giving ample and cheerful evidence, how bountifully the soil\r\nrewards honest labor. Nor, in their prosperity, have they forgotten Him\r\nfrom whom all blessings flow.\r\n\r\nWhere a few years ago the Catholic settlers, few and poor, waited\r\nanxiously for the visit of the priest, and where the holy sacrifice of\r\nthe mass was offered up in the settler's cabin, we now find the resident\r\npriest, the handsome church, and in many instances, the Sisters' school.\r\nIn those settlements the whole atmosphere is Catholic; here, with no bad\r\ninfluences around them, the young people grow up pure and virtuous, with\r\nthe love of their religion warm in their hearts. An ample reward to\r\ntheir parents, those brave men, the early settlers, who displayed such\r\nindomitable perseverance in their battle for\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nThey had to steer their way with the compass, over trackless prairies,\r\noften while the snow lay upon the ground, to blaze their way through the\r\nforest or follow an Indian trail, carrying their provisions on their\r\nbacks, and when the claim shanty was put up and the provisions\r\nexhausted, the new settler would often have to return twenty, forty,\r\nsixty miles to some place where he could buy a few more pounds of flour,\r\nand with this and perhaps half a bushel of potatoes to put in the\r\nground, he would again set off to his new claim.\r\n\r\nBut in all the privations they went through, those connected with\r\nreligion they felt the most. And, praise be to God, among the earliest\r\nevidences of their growing prosperity was the erection of temples to His\r\nworship, that to-day, on every side, ornament the State. Wherever in the\r\nState there is a clustering of Catholic settlements, there you will find\r\na clustering of Catholic churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS AND MORAL VIEW OF THE QUESTION OF IMMIGRATION TO THE LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a Catholic, this is, after all, the most important view, and must not\r\nbe overlooked; at the same time it is obvious that it cannot be done\r\njustice to in a condensed pamphlet of this kind.\r\n\r\nThere is about the same difference between the moral atmosphere of the\r\nrural Catholic colonies to which we invite our people, and the back\r\nstreets and alleys of the over-crowded city, as there is between the\r\npure air of the prairie and the foul air of the city lane.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, a friend from the East, to whom we were showing some of\r\nour Catholic settlements, said to us,\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is not surprising that the people settled out here in the\r\ncountry should be moral and religious, they have much to make them so,\r\nand nothing to make them otherwise in their surroundings; but look at\r\nour poor people, huddled together in the tenement houses of New York.\r\nWhen you find them good, give them praise.\"\r\n\r\n\"And many of them are good,\" we said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" he answered; \"but the great danger is to the children. The\r\npriest does his best, the Catholic parent grounded in his religion\r\nbefore he ever saw a city does his best, but his circumstances compel\r\nhim to live where the foul air reeks with blasphemy, and low debauchery;\r\nvice and drunkenness are ever before their eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a very sad picture, but a very true one. It is a fearful reality\r\nbefore the eyes of many a poor Catholic parent, who obliged to be\r\ncontinually absent from his children, knows but too well the society\r\nthey are likely to fall into.\r\n\r\nIn our Catholic colonies in Minnesota a parent has no such dread. He\r\nknows where his boys are on week days; they are helping him on the farm.\r\nHe knows where they are on Sundays; they are with him at church. When\r\nthey are amusing themselves, he knows that they are with the young\r\npeople of his neighbors, their companions and co-religionists.\r\n\r\nHere, too, the anxious heart of the loving mother is at rest; for she\r\nsees her daughters associating with the good and innocent of their own\r\nage, and growing up pure and virtuous.\r\n\r\n\"God made the country and man made the town,\" is an old saying. The\r\nimmigration of those of our people adapted to agricultural life from the\r\ncity to the land will be a benefit, not alone to themselves, but to\r\nthose they leave behind. By this healthful drain the latter will be left\r\nmore room, and have more opportunities to better their condition.\r\n\r\nFrom any side we view it, it is a great and good work to encourage and\r\nlabor for Catholic immigration to the land, where INDEPENDENCE shall\r\nreward labor, and Catholic zeal shall spread our holy faith over the\r\nfertile prairies of the West.\r\n\r\nWe would be very sorry to see, even if it was practicable, our people\r\nleaving the cities _en masse_. Many of them, well adapted for city life,\r\nrise to prosperity and social position in the city. Some to high\r\nprofessional or business standing, others to moderate respectable\r\nindependence; others, in humbler walks of life, to decent homes of their\r\nown, and the city affords to the well brought up children of such homes,\r\nmany solid advantages. We want full representation for our people in the\r\ncity, and full representation on the land. By encouraging those of our\r\npeople adapted, and best adapted for agricultural pursuits, to seek the\r\nland, we benefit them and benefit those who remain behind as well, for\r\nwe give the latter healthy room and more opportunities: in a word, we\r\nimprove the condition of our people, both in the city and in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STATEMENT IN REGARD TO THE RELATIONS WE HOLD TOWARDS IMMIGRANTS. WHAT\r\nTHEY MAY EXPECT.\r\n\r\n     THE CLASS WE INVITE.--THE PROPER TIMBER MUST BE IN THE MAN HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great drawback to organized colonization is, that people expect too\r\nmuch; therefore we will be explicit, and state exactly what is proposed\r\nto be done for those coming to the Catholic colonies of Minnesota. In\r\nthe first place, they will get in this pamphlet truthful and full\r\nstatistics of the State, so far as those statistics are of interest to\r\nthem; they will also get full details in regard to our colonies, and all\r\nthe directions and information necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrive here (in St. Paul,) by calling at the office of the\r\nCatholic Colonization Bureau they will be directed to whichever colony\r\nthey may wish to go. Arrived at the colony, they will be shown over its\r\nlands. Then when the immigrant has made his selection and taken\r\npossession, he must depend from thenceforth, on himself, and the more he\r\ndoes so the more he will feel himself a man.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic immigrant coming now to Minnesota will not be subject to\r\nthe severe trials and hardships the early settlers encountered, while he\r\nwill be altogether exempt from the religious and social privations they\r\nhad to bear through many lonely years.\r\n\r\nThe immigrant is now conveyed to the Catholic Colony he may select, by\r\nrailroad train, and finds before him church and priest, market and\r\nsettlers; nevertheless he should be a man possessing that noble quality\r\nwhich western life so well develops--\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-RELIANCE.\r\n\r\nUnder God, it is on himself he must depend for future success.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the proper place to speak of the class of persons whom we\r\ncan confidently invite to our Catholic colonies--\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS ALONE.\r\n\r\nNot necessarily those who have heretofore been engaged altogether in\r\nagricultural pursuits, but persons who come to settle on farms, and who\r\nare able and willing to hold the plow. The poor man to succeed on a farm\r\nin Minnesota, must hold his own plow, and do his own chores; and, above\r\nall, have courage and strength to depend upon himself.\r\n\r\nIf he has a good, healthy, cheerful, wife, who prefers the prattle of\r\nher children to the gossip of the street, why, all the better--let him\r\ncome along, and we will put him on the road to\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPERITY.\r\n\r\nHe has made more than half the journey already, when he has secured a\r\ngood wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA.\r\n\r\n     ITS GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION--SIZE--OPINIONS OF DISTINGUISHED\r\n     MEN--FERTILITY, BEAUTY AND HEALTHFULNESS OF THE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State contains 83,153 square miles or 53,459,840 acres, and is,\r\ntherefore, one of the largest in the Union. It occupies the exact centre\r\nof the continent of North America. It lies midway between the Arctic and\r\nTropic circles--midway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans--and\r\nmidway between Hudson's Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. It embraces the\r\nsources of three vast water systems which reach their ocean termini,\r\nnorthward through Hudson's Bay, eastward through the chain of great\r\nlakes, and southward via the Mississippi River. It extends from 43-1/2°\r\nto 49° of north latitude, and from 89° 29' to 97° 5' of west longitude;\r\nand is bounded on the north by the Winnipeg district of British America,\r\non the west by the Territory of Dakota, on the south by the State of\r\nIowa, and on the east by Lake Superior and the State of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIn official reports before us, we find many interesting extracts from\r\nthe writings of well-known public men, agriculturists, geologists,\r\nprofessors in various branches of science, engineers, surveyors and\r\ngovernment officials, who have visited Minnesota at various times on\r\nbusiness or pleasure, and who have borne enthusiastic testimony of her\r\nresources, the fertility of her soil, the healthfulness of her climate\r\nand the beauty of her scenery.\r\n\r\nA few sentences from all these writings will suffice for us in this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn the official report of General Pope, who was commissioned by the\r\ngovernment to make a topographical survey of portions of the State, we\r\nfind the following sentence, which embraces almost all that can be said\r\nin praise. He says:\r\n\r\n\"I KNOW _of_ NO COUNTRY _on_ EARTH _where so_ MANY _advantages are\r\npresented to the_ FARMER AND MANUFACTURER.\"\r\n\r\nThe adaptability of our rich soil for all the staple crops, as proven by\r\nexperience, the large yield per acre in wheat, oats, potatoes, &c., &c.,\r\nthe immense quantity of good land in large bodies, the truly magnificent\r\nwater power within the State, and so beneficently located in its\r\ndifferent sections; all these advantages, seen beneath a sky always\r\nbright, and in a climate at all seasons healthy, may well account for\r\nthe enthusiasm which inspired the above eulogy on Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe accredited correspondent of the Chicago Tribune, who visited this\r\nState some three years ago, is equally enthusiastic in his published\r\nletters to his paper. We give two extracts from those letters.\r\n\r\n     \"No wonder the people here wear such smiling countenances. They are\r\n     full of hope. I have yet to see the first despairing or gloomy\r\n     face. Melancholy belongs to the overcrowded cities, and there is\r\n     plenty of it in Chicago.\r\n\r\n     \"Is it not astonishing that so many able-bodied men should hang\r\n     about our large cities doing nothing, because they can find nothing\r\n     to do, and nearly starving to death, when these broad and fertile\r\n     prairies are calling upon them to come and release the treasures\r\n     which lie within the soil.\r\n\r\n     \"The resources or this State are immense. It has every variety of\r\n     wealth, and every facility for profitable exchange. There is no\r\n     more productive soil in the world. Then the State has an abundance\r\n     of pine timber. It has a vast amount of available water power, and\r\n     offers every facility and encouragement to manufacturing industry.\r\n     It has mineral wealth on Lake Superior of iron and copper, in\r\n     inexhaustible abundance. There is no region in this country, or any\r\n     country, that I am aware of, that is so well watered. And the water\r\n     is everywhere clear and pure. It is a land of great rivers,\r\n     pellucid lakes, and sparkling streams.\r\n\r\n     \"All this may sound enthusiastic, but every word is calmly written\r\n     and justified by the facts; and it is strictly within the facts. If\r\n     the advantages of this region were only adequately made known,\r\n     there would surely be a great flow of labor from the cities and\r\n     places where it is not wanted, into a region like this, where every\r\n     variety of labor is needed and where it is certain to meet with a\r\n     rich reward.\"\r\n\r\nIn the second extract we give, this correspondent expresses himself in\r\nlanguage very similar to that made use of by General Pope. He says,\r\nstill speaking of Minnesota:\r\n\r\n     \"I know of no other portion of the earth's surface where so many\r\n     advantages are concentrated, and where the man of industry and\r\n     small means may so quickly and with so much certainty render\r\n     himself independent. Here you have a climate of exceeding purity, a\r\n     soil of amazing productiveness, abundance of the clearest water,\r\n     with groves, and lakes, and rivers and streams wherever they are\r\n     wanted. Then the great railway lines are beginning to intersect\r\n     this country in all directions, and thus furnish the farmer with a\r\n     cheap and immediate outlet for his produce.\"\r\n\r\nWe will close these brief extracts--taken from the writings of persons\r\nwell qualified to form a sound judgment on the subject they were\r\ndiscussing, and totally unconnected personally with the interests of\r\nMinnesota--with two extracts from a speech of the distinguished\r\nstatesman, Hon. Wm. H. Seward, delivered in St. Paul, the capital of our\r\nState, so far back as 1860.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward said, and America has not produced so far-seeing a statesman:\r\n\r\n     \"Here is the place--the central place--where the agriculture of the\r\n     richest region of North America must pour out its tributes to the\r\n     whole world. On the east, all along the shore of Lake Superior, and\r\n     west, stretching in one broad plain in a belt quite across the\r\n     continent, is a country where State after State is yet to rise, and\r\n     where the productions for the support of human society in the old\r\n     crowded States must be brought forth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I now believe that the ultimate last seat of government on this\r\n     great continent will be found, somewhere within a circle or radius\r\n     not very far from the spot on which I stand, at the head of\r\n     navigation on the Mississippi river.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL STATE STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n     LAKES, RIVERS, TIMBER, CLIMATE, SOIL, STOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following we have borrowed much from authorized State reports,\r\nadding our own comments when necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKES.\r\n\r\nMinnesota abounds in lakes of great beauty. They are from one to fifty\r\nmiles in diameter, and are well stocked with a variety of fish. Those\r\nbeautiful lakes are found in every portion of the State, sparkling on\r\nthe open prairie, hidden in groves, or resting calm and pure in the\r\ndepths of the silent forest.\r\n\r\n\"It may be interesting,\" says John W. Bond, Secretary of the Minnesota\r\nState Board of Immigration, \"to note the areas of a few of the largest\r\nlakes in our State. Lake Minnetonka contains 16,000 acres; Lake\r\nWinnebagoshish, 56,000 acres; Leech Lake, 114,000 acres; and Mille Lacs,\r\n130,000 acres. Red Lake, which is much larger than any other in the\r\nState, has not yet been surveyed.\r\n\r\n\"The above estimate of 2,700,000 acres in lakes does not embrace the\r\nvast water areas included in the projected boundary lines of the State\r\nin Lake Superior and Lake of the Woods, and along the great water\r\nstretches of the international line.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance to the State of having Lake Superior as an outlet for its\r\nproduce cannot be overestimated. The day is not distant when a large\r\namount of grain will be shipped in bulk from the Minnesota harbor\r\n(Duluth) on Lake Superior, to the Liverpool market in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVERS.\r\n\r\nMinnesota has five navigable rivers. The Mississippi (The Father of\r\nWaters,) having its rise in Lake Itaska, in the northern part of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe St. Croix, flowing through a large portion of the lumbering region.\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota, rising in Dakota Territory and flowing through a large\r\nportion of the State empties into the Mississippi, five miles above St.\r\nPaul. It is navigable, in favorable seasons, about 300 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Red River of the North, forming the northwestern boundary of the\r\nState for a distance of 380 miles, and navigable about 250.\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis River, flowing into Lake Superior on our northeastern\r\nboundary, a distance of 135 miles.\r\n\r\nBesides these, the largest rivers are the Root, Rum, Crow, Sauk, Elk,\r\nLong Prairie, Crow Wing, Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Maple, Cobb, Watonwan,\r\nSnake, Kettle, Redwood, Wild Rice, Buffalo, Chippewa, Marsh, Pomme de\r\nTerre, Lac qui Parle, Mustinka, Yellow Medicine, Two Rivers, Cottonwood,\r\nCannon, Zumbro, Whitewater, Cedar, Red Lake, Straight, Vermillion, and\r\nothers. These, with a vast number of smaller streams tributary to them,\r\nramifying through fertile upland and grassy meadow, in every section of\r\nthe State, afford invaluable facilities for the various purposes of\r\nlumbering, milling, manufacturing and agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn connection with her rivers, we will say that Minnesota has perhaps\r\nthe finest water power, within her bounds, to be found in the world.\r\nThis power is found all over the State, and though only very partially\r\ndeveloped, it serves to manufacture 2,600,000 barrels of flour annually,\r\nand runs 250 saw mills.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMBER.\r\n\r\nMinnesota is neither a timber nor a prairie State; yet it possesses in a\r\nlarge degree the advantages of both, there being unquestionably a better\r\nproportion of timber and prairie, and a more admirable intermingling of\r\nthe two than in any other State. It is estimated that about one-third of\r\nMinnesota is timbered land, of more or less dense growth. In Iowa, it\r\nhas been officially estimated that only about one-tenth to one-eight of\r\nthe State is timbered.\r\n\r\nOn the head-waters of the various tributaries of the extreme Upper\r\nMississippi and St. Croix rivers is an extensive forest country, known\r\nas the \"pine region,\" comprising an estimated area of 21,000 square\r\nmiles. Extending in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction, about\r\n100 miles long, and an average width of 40, is the largest body of\r\nhard-wood timber between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. It lies on\r\nboth sides of the Minnesota River, comprising in all an area of 5,000\r\nsquare miles, and is known as the \"Big Woods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nProminent among the questions proposed by the immigrant seeking a new\r\nhome in a new country, are those concerning the climate, its\r\ntemperature, adaptation to the culture of the grand staples of food, and\r\nits healthfulness.\r\n\r\n\"The climate of Minnesota has often been the subject of unjust\r\ndisparagement. 'It is too far north;' 'the winters are intolerable.'\r\nThese and other similar remarks have found expression by those who\r\nshould have known better. To the old settler of Minnesota, the seasons\r\nfollow each other in pleasing succession. As the sun approaches his\r\nnorthern latitude, winter relaxes its grasp, streams and lakes are\r\nunbound, flowers spring up as if by the touch of some magic wand, and\r\ngradually spring is merged into the bright, beautiful June, with its\r\nlong, warm days, and short, but cool and refreshing nights. The harvest\r\nmonths follow in rapid succession, till the golden Indian summer of\r\nearly November foretells the approach of cold and snow; and again\r\nwinter, with its short days of clear, bright sky and bracing air, and\r\nits long nights of cloudless beauty, completes the circle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men,\" says the late J. B. Phillips, Commissioner of Statistics, \"suffer\r\nthemselves to be deluded with the idea that heat is in some way a\r\npositive good, and cold a positive evil. The world is in need of a\r\nsermon on the gospel and blessing of cold.\r\n\r\n\"What is there at best in the indolent languor of tropic siestas for any\r\nlive man or woman to be pining after? Macauley, after his residence in\r\nIndia, did not. He said that you boiled there four or five months in the\r\nyear, then roasted four or five more, and had the remainder of the year\r\nto 'get cool if you could.' 'If you could!' No way of refrigerating a\r\ntropic atmosphere has ever yet been devised; while you can be perfectly\r\ncomfortable in any north temperate zone.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he says:\r\n\r\n\"The healthfulness of Minnesota is one of its strongest points. Having\r\nbeen, for a long time, a sanitary resort for persons threatened with\r\npulmonary complaints, it has disappointed no reasonable expectation. It\r\nis equally favorable for those afflicted with liver diseases. Thus for\r\nthe two great organs in the tripod of life, the liver and lungs, that\r\nis for two-thirds of life, Minnesota offers the most favorable\r\nconditions. She is more exempt from paludial fevers then any new State\r\nsettled in the last half century. The fearful cost of human life it has\r\nrequired to subdue the soil in the States along the line of lat. 40° has\r\nnever been estimated. With a moist, decaying vegetation, and a certain\r\nintensity and duration of summer and autumn heat, sickness of that kind\r\nis certain to come, no matter what they may _say_ about having 'no\r\nsickness here.' It always exists when the requisite conditions are\r\npresent. Freed from the depressing influence of this decimating foe, the\r\naverage Minnesotian eats with a craving appetite, sleeps well, moves\r\nwith a quick step and elastic spirits, and fights his life-battle\r\nsturdily and hopefully to the issue.\"\r\n\r\nThe mean yearly temperature of our Minnesota climate, (44.6,) coincides\r\nwith that of Central Wisconsin, Michigan, Central New York, Southern\r\nVermont, New Hampshire, and Maine; but in the dryness of its atmosphere\r\nit has, both for health and comfort, at great advantage over those\r\nStates. It is well known that dampness is the element from whence come\r\nsickness and suffering, either in cold or warm weather, and the dry\r\natmosphere of winter in Minnesota, at an average temperature of 16°,\r\nmakes the cold less felt than in warmer but damper climates several\r\ndegrees farther south.\r\n\r\nWith the new year generally commences the severe cold of our winter, but\r\nfor the last few seasons the old Minnesota winters seem to be giving\r\nplace to much milder ones. During last winter the thermometer, in the\r\nmost exposed places, scarcely ever marked zero, and now, on the 21st of\r\nDecember--weeks after they have had fierce snow storms south and\r\nsouthwest of us--good sleighing in Chicago and St. Louis--we are getting\r\nour first regular fall of snow, (only a slight sprinkling before,) which\r\nis falling unaccompanied with either wind or cold and giving a good\r\npromise of merry sleigh rides during the Christmas holidays.\r\n\r\nWhether or not there has come a permanent change in our Minnesota\r\nwinters, brought about by causes affected by population and settlement,\r\nwe cannot say; but that such a change would not be acceptable to many of\r\nour old settlers we are convinced; not certainly to the enthusiast who\r\nwrites as follows of our old, crisp, bright winters:\r\n\r\n\"Winter in Minnesota is a season of ceaseless business activity, and\r\nconstant social enjoyment; and by those accustomed to long wintry\r\nstorms, and continued alternations of mud, and cold, and snow, is\r\npronounced far preferable to the winters in any section of the Northern\r\nStates. Here there is an exhilaration in the crisp atmosphere which\r\nquickens the blood, and sends the bounding steps over the ringing snow\r\nwith an exultant flurry of good-spirits akin to the highest enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless this was written from the stand-point of warm robes, a light\r\ncutter, a fast horse, and tingling sleigh-bells; nevertheless it is in\r\nthe main true. When the surface of the body is warmly clothed, one can\r\nenjoy out-door exercise in the winter with every comfort.\r\n\r\nThe greatest and only objection that we find against the winter season\r\nin Minnesota, is its length.--It is true that, as a general rule, we\r\nhave all our spring wheat in the ground, and for the most part over\r\nground, before the end of April.--This infringement of winter, as we may\r\nterm it, upon the domain of spring, is the draw-back to our climate.\r\n\r\nIt is a slight one compared to those of other climates, where spring\r\nbrings with its flowers, fever, ague, and chills.\r\n\r\nThe summer months are pleasant. We have hot days, as one can judge by\r\nbearing in mind that our wheat crop is put into the ground, cut and\r\noften threshed, all within three months, but our nights are always\r\nbeautiful and cool. Then comes autumn, when the wayside copse, blushing\r\nat the hot kisses of the sun, turns scarlet, and every tint of shade and\r\ncolor is seen in the variegated foliage of the forest; and then the\r\nhazy, Indian summer--nothing so lovely could last long on earth--when\r\nforest and prairie, dell and highland, palpitate with a hushed beauty,\r\nand to live is happiness sufficient.\r\n\r\nPure air is health, life. Winter and summer, fall and spring, the air of\r\nMinnesota, free from all malaria, is pure. We promise to the new settler\r\nmaking a home on land in Minnesota, plenty of hard work, and the best of\r\nhealth and spirits--so far as climate has any effect on those blessings,\r\nand it has a great deal--while doing it. It will not be necessary for\r\nhim to get acclimated, but to pitch right in.\r\n\r\nDisturnell, author of a work on the \"Influence of Climate in North and\r\nSouth America,\" says that \"_Minnesota may be said to excel any portion\r\nof the Union in a healthy and invigorating climate_.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with this very important subject, health, the following\r\ncomparative statement as to the proportion of deaths to population, in\r\nseveral countries in Europe and States in the Union, will be read with\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n  Minnesota                   1 in 155 | Wisconsin            1 in 108\r\n  Great Britain and Ireland   1 in  46 | Iowa                 1 in  93\r\n  Germany                     1 in  37 | Illinois             1 in  73\r\n  Norway                      1 in  56 | Missouri             1 in  51\r\n  Sweden                      1 in  50 | Michigan             1 in  88\r\n  Denmark                     1 in  46 | Louisiana            1 in  43\r\n  France                      1 in  41 | Texas                1 in  46\r\n  Switzerland                 1 in  41 | Pennsylvania         1 in  96\r\n  Holland                     1 in  39 | United States        1 in  74\r\n\r\nThe above is so conclusive an exhibit in confirmation of the\r\nhealthfulness of the Minnesota climate, that it exhausts the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL.\r\n\r\nUnder this head, the late J. B. Phillips, Commissioner of Statistics,\r\nfrom whose work we have already quoted, says:\r\n\r\n\"The soil of the arable part of the State is generally of the best\r\nquality, rich in lime and organic matter, and particularly well adapted\r\nto the growth of wheat, over 26,400,000 bushels of which cereal were\r\nproduced in 1873, and over 30,000,000 in 1875. Although its fertility\r\nhas never been disputed, these authentic figures prove it beyond\r\nquestion. Good wheat lands in a favorable season will produce from 25 to\r\n30 bushels to the acre. I believe the whole county of Goodhue, in a\r\nyield of between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 bushels, very nearly averaged\r\nthe first figures in 1875. A great portion of the State is equally\r\nadapted to stock raising, and many farmers think it would be more\r\nprofitable.\"\r\n\r\nWe will add to this, by way of a note, that in 1877, as will be seen on\r\nanother page, Minnesota with only 3,000,000 acres of her land under\r\ncultivation, produced 35,000,000 bushels of wheat, almost all No. 1\r\nquality, and that Goodhue County, mentioned in the extract quoted, had a\r\nyield of 4,050,250 bushels.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nWe know of no country where stock, horses and sheep, do better than in\r\nMinnesota, and we believe that it will be found true that the climate\r\nconducive to the health of human beings is one where all kinds of\r\ndomestic animals will thrive.\r\n\r\nWe had, some time ago, a very interesting conversation with Mr.\r\nFeatherston, an English gentleman residing in Goodhue County, on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nHe informed us that he had farmed in England, in the State of New York,\r\nin Kansas, and now in Minnesota, and he was never in a place where sheep\r\nand stock did better than here. \"I attribute this,\" he said, \"to the\r\ndryness of our winter weather. Sheep here are not weighed down with wet\r\nfleeces; and as for cattle, they suffer more in southern Kansas, where\r\nthey can remain out all the year, than they do here in the coldest days\r\nof winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" we asked.\r\n\r\n\"Easily accounted for,\" he replied. \"One part of the day, in Kansas, it\r\nwill be raining, the coats of the cattle will be saturated with wet,\r\nthen it comes on to freeze, and they become sheeted with ice; this is\r\nvery injurious to the health of a beast. Sheep raising in Minnesota I\r\nhave found very profitable farming indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the soil of Minnesota?\" we asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"I was home in England two years ago, traveled about\r\na good deal, and did not see any soil equal to the soil of Minnesota.\"\r\n\r\nNow, in speaking of Minnesota for stock-raising, it must be borne in\r\nmind that it is more expensive to keep cattle here, where they must be\r\nfed many months in the year, than where they can run at large the whole\r\nyear; but, if properly housed during winter, young cattle fed on wild\r\nhay--which can be put up for $1.50 per ton--will come out in the spring\r\nin fine condition.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities of getting wild hay in the localities where our\r\nCatholic colonies are located, are not surpassed in any part of the\r\nState; and it will be borne in mind that if there is extra expense and\r\ntrouble in raising cattle here, there is also extra good prices to get\r\nfor them. A steer that will sell for $10 in places where, like Topsey,\r\nhe \"just grows,\" will sell here for from $30 to $40.\r\n\r\nThe following, taken from a late report of a committee of the Chamber of\r\nCommerce, St. Paul, will be read with interest:\r\n\r\n\"Our climate and soil appear to be peculiarly adapted for grazing\r\npurposes. Its healthfulness for cattle of every kind is well\r\nestablished. The abundant and prolific yield of both tame and wild or\r\nnatural grasses, of every description incident to the West, affords\r\nabundant and cheap pasturage during the summer, and the choicest of hay\r\nfor winter, which is produced at less expense per ton than in most of\r\nthe States in the Union. If necessary, your committee could refer to\r\ncountless instances in regard to the profit of raising stock in the\r\nState. The demand for horses has always been in excess of the supply.\r\nThousands are introduced into our midst every year from the adjoining\r\nStates. The demand will increase as the country west of us becomes\r\nsettled. Choice herds of cattle have been imported into the State during\r\nthe past few years, attended in every instance, as far as your committee\r\nhave been able to learn, with much profit to the enterprising parties\r\nwho embarked in the lucrative business. The dairy is being introduced in\r\nthe shape of cheese and butter factories in many neighborhoods and\r\nattended with much success. It appears that shipments of both these home\r\nproducts have been made to England with satisfactory results. The\r\nsheep-fold to some extent has been neglected, but those who have engaged\r\nin wool-growing are greatly encouraged. Flocks of sheep brought from the\r\nEast have, with their progeny, improved to such an extent by the\r\ninfluence of our climate, that they have been repurchased by those from\r\nwhom they were originally bought, and transported back East to improve\r\nthe breed of their stock. The wool becomes of a finer texture when\r\nproduced in our State, also an increase in size of the carcass of the\r\nsheep.\"\r\n\r\nThe advantages which our present Catholic colonies afford, abounding in\r\nnutritious grasses and the best quality of wild hay lands, will we trust\r\nturn the attention of settlers to stock raising, butter packing and\r\ncheese factories, and we are informed that some enterprising parties are\r\ngoing to establish one of the latter at Clontarf, in Swift County\r\nColony. Farming to be prosperous the industry on the farm must be\r\ndiversified; there should be rotation of crops. It will not do to depend\r\naltogether on wheat or to be too ambitious to have a great breadth of it\r\nunder cultivation; not an acre more than the farmer knows he will be\r\nwell able to have out of the ground in good season, making no chance\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROP STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n     WHEAT, OATS, POTATOES, CORN, HAY, SORGHUM, FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Minnesota was organized into a territory, and the following\r\nyear, 1850, she had under cultivation 1,900 acres of land. In 1877, she\r\nhad 3,000,000 acres. In these twenty-seven years, during which the\r\nbreadth of her cultivated lands has increased over one thousand five\r\nhundred fold, the quality and average quantity per acre of all the great\r\nstaple crops have been equally satisfactory, until we find her to-day,\r\ntaking the foremost place as an agricultural State.\r\n\r\nTo quote from the writings of the Hon. Pennock Pusey, than whom there is\r\nno more upright gentleman nor one more qualified to deal with\r\nstatistics, we find that\r\n\r\n     \"According to the census of 1870, the entire wheat product of New\r\n     England was sufficient to feed her own people only three weeks!\r\n     That of New York sufficient for her own consumption six months;\r\n     that of Pennsylvania, after feeding her own people, afforded no\r\n     surplus; while the surplus of Ohio was but 3,000,000 bushels for\r\n     that year, and for the past six years her wheat crop has fallen\r\n     below her own consumption. In the ten years ending in 1870, the\r\n     wheat crop of these States decreased 6,500,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n     \"In the light of these facts, the achievements of Minnesota in\r\n     wheat growing, as well as her untaxed capacity for the continued\r\n     and increased production of that grain, assume a proud\r\n     pre-eminence.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not too high praise for Minnesota, when we find the great State\r\nof Ohio for the last six years failing to raise sufficient wheat for her\r\nown consumption, while Minnesota with but 2,232,988 acres under wheat,\r\nhas, after bountifully supplying her own population, exported in 1877\r\nover fifteen million of bushels.\r\n\r\nThe important position which Minnesota is destined, in the near future,\r\nto assume as a great contributor to the supply of the most important\r\narticle of food used by the human family, is well put forward by Mr.\r\nPusey in the paper we have already quoted from. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"But a more practical as well as serious aspect of the subject\r\n     pertains to those social problems connected with supplies of bread.\r\n     The grave significance of the question involved is not susceptible\r\n     of concealment, when the fact is considered, that while the\r\n     consumption of wheat, as the choice food of the human race, is\r\n     rapidly extending, the capacity of wheat-growing regions for its\r\n     production is rapidly diminishing.\"\r\n\r\nWe will now give some extracts from the report of the late J. B.\r\nPhilips, Commissioner of Statistics. We select from his report with\r\ngreat satisfaction, because he has been very careful to make his\r\ncalculations rather under than over the truth.\r\n\r\nWe find the following under the head of\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT, 1875.\r\n\r\nThe number of bushels of wheat gathered and threshed, according to the\r\nreturns reported to the Commissioner for the year 1875, was 28,769,736;\r\nbut there were 77,032 acres unreported, which at 17-1/2 bushels per\r\nacre, (the general average,) would make a total of 30,079,300 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe number of acres reported as cultivated in wheat for 1875 was\r\n1,764,109.\r\n\r\nIllinois, with her large cultivated area, has until recently been the\r\nlargest wheat-raising State. In 1860 she produced 23,837,023 bushels,\r\nand in 1870 30,128,405 bushels.\r\n\r\n\"In 1871,\" says one of her statisticians, \"the United States produced\r\n235,884,700 bushels of wheat, of which 27,115,000 are assigned to\r\nIllinois, or about 700,000 bushels more than any other State.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the product of the United States was 230,722,400 bushels, of\r\nwhich Illinois had 25,216,000, being followed by Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\nWisconsin and Iowa.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Illinois produced 30,128,405. \"But,\" says the same authority,\r\n\"we now (1870) find Iowa close alongside of us, her product being\r\n29,435,692 bushels of wheat.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that neither Minnesota nor California were deemed\r\nworthy of notice in this rivalry of these older States. But in three\r\nyears from that date Minnesota, as well as Iowa, was \"close alongside\"\r\nof Illinois, raising from 15 millions in 1870 to 22 millions in 1872,\r\nand 26,402,485 in 1873. In 1874 the wheat product of Minnesota was\r\nwithin a fraction of 24 millions. I give her yields in this table:\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT YIELD FOR FOUR YEARS IN SUCCESSION.\r\n\r\n                          Bushels.

But the average is\r\nmuch higher than this, for in the above table no account is taken of the\r\ngardens and large breadth of flax under cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe official report, when published, may differ slightly with the above,\r\nbut not to an extent to make any alteration necessary.\r\n\r\nWe are informed that, in several instances, land giving wheat for the\r\nlast twenty years, without being fertilized or manured, produced in 1877\r\nover twenty bushels of wheat to the acre; a fact creditable to the land,\r\nbut very discreditable to the farmers engaged in such _land murder_.\r\n\r\nWhile Minnesota has, without dispute, established her reputation as a\r\ngreat wheat producer, and the dangers which always lie in wait for the\r\ngrowing crops are perhaps less here than in most of the other western\r\nStates, still it must not be supposed that we can expect to be always\r\nfree from them. If we had any such idea it would have been dispelled by\r\nour experience the past season. Never since the State was organized was\r\nthere a finer prospect of a magnificent wheat yield than we had during\r\nthe months of May, June and the first half of July, 1878. It was not\r\nthat the general crop was good, but one could not, in a day's travel,\r\nfind one poor looking field; but just as the wheat was within a few days\r\nof being fit to cut, a fierce, hot sun, lasting a week or so, came and\r\nwilted up the grain, so that the crop lost materially in quality, weight\r\nand measure.\r\n\r\nYet this evil had its compensating good. Our corn and potato crops were\r\nvery fine, so that our farmers have learned a lesson in the value of\r\nhaving diversity of crops as a leading feature in their farming system,\r\nand be it remembered that without system there is no successful farming.\r\n\r\nThe following statement is taken from the immigration pamphlet, issued\r\nby the Minnesota Board of Immigration for 1878:\r\n\r\n\r\nOATS.\r\n\r\nOats is peculiarly a northern grain. It is only with comparatively cool\r\natmosphere that this grain attains the solidity, and yields the return\r\nwhich remunerate the labor and cost of production. The rare adaptation\r\nof the soil and climate of Minnesota to the growth of this grain, is\r\nshown not only by the large average, but the superior quality of the\r\nproduct, the oats of this State being heavier by from three to eight\r\npounds per bushel than that produced elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe following is an exhibit of the result for the several years named:\r\n\r\n                                    No. bushels   Average yield\r\n  Year.

Our State is often supposed to be too far north for\r\nIndian corn. This is a great mistake, founded on the popular fallacy\r\nthat the latitude governs climate. But climates grow warmer towards the\r\nwest coasts of continents; and although its winters are cold, the\r\nsummers of Minnesota are as warm as those of Southern Ohio. _The mean\r\nsummer heat of St. Paul is precisely that of Philadelphia_, five degrees\r\nfurther south, while it is considerably warmer during the whole six\r\nmonths of the growing season than Chicago, three degrees further south.\r\nThe products of the soil confirm these meteorological indications.\r\n\r\nThe average yield of corn in 1868 was 37.33 bushels per acre, and in\r\n1875--a bad year--25 bushels. In Illinois--of which corn is the chief\r\nstaple--Mr. Lincoln, late President of the United States, in the course\r\nof an agricultural address in 1859, stated that the average crop from\r\nyear to year does not exceed twenty bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThese results, so favorable to Minnesota as a corn growing as well as\r\nwheat growing State, will surprise no one who is familiar with the fact\r\nestablished by climatologists, that \"the cultivated plants yield the\r\ngreatest products near the northernmost limits at which they will grow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON WITH OTHER STATES.\r\n\r\nA comparison with other States affords the following exhibit:\r\n\r\n                                              Bushels per acre.\r\n  Ohio, average of nineteen years                     32.8\r\n  Iowa, average of six years                          31.97\r\n  Minnesota, average of nine years                    30.98\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES.\r\n\r\nThe average yield in Minnesota and other States is here shown:\r\n\r\n                                              Bushels per acre.\r\n  Minnesota, average for five years                  120.76\r\n  Iowa, average for five years                        76.73\r\n  Ohio, average for nine years                        74.55\r\n\r\n\r\nHAY.\r\n\r\nAmong the grasses that appear to be native to the soil of Minnesota are\r\nfound timothy, white clover, blue grass and red top. They grow most\r\nluxuriantly, and many claim that they contain nearly as much nutriment\r\nas ordinary oats. So excellent are the grasses that the tame varieties\r\nare but little cultivated. The wild grasses which cover the immense\r\nsurface of natural meadow land formed by the alluvial bottoms of the\r\nintricate network of streams which everywhere intersect the country, are\r\nas rich and nutritious in this latitude as the best exotic varieties,\r\nhence cultivation is unnecessary. The yield of these grasses is 2.12\r\ntons to the acre, or 60 per cent more than that of Ohio, the great hay\r\nState!\r\n\r\n\r\nSORGHUM.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the sugar cane is fast becoming popular among the\r\nfarmers of Minnesota, and one Mr. Seth H. Kenney, of Rice county, claims\r\nthat it can be made more profitable than even the wheat crop. The syrup\r\nand sugar produced is of the finest character, possessing an extremely\r\nexcellent flavor. An acre of properly cultivated land will yield from\r\none hundred and seventy-five to two hundred gallons of syrup, worth\r\nseventy cents a gallon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS.\r\n\r\nThe following short extracts are taken from a paper written by Col. D.\r\nA. Robertson, of St. Paul, a scientific amateur fruit grower; one\r\nthoroughly conversant with the subject on which he writes, and to whose\r\ndisinterested labors in this branch of industry the State owes much:\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt that Minnesota will become a great fruit State,\r\nbecause wherever wild fruits of any species grow, improved fruit of the\r\nsame or cognate species may be successfully cultivated. The indigenous\r\nflora of Minnesota, embraces apples, plums, cherries, grapes,\r\nstrawberries, raspberries, currants and gooseberries. We may, therefore,\r\nsuccessfully and profitably cultivate the improved kinds of all these\r\nfruits. The conditions of success are only these:--experience, knowledge\r\nand perseverance.\r\n\r\n\"All kinds of Siberian Crab apples, (which are valuable chiefly for\r\npreserves,) including the improved Transcendant and Hyslop, are\r\nperfectly adapted to our climate; and flourish in almost every soil and\r\nsituation where any other tree will grow, and also produce great crops.\r\n\r\n\"At our State Fair at St. Paul, in October, 1871, there was a\r\nmagnificent display of home grown fruits, which would have been\r\ncreditable to any State in the West. Among the numerous varieties of\r\nexcellent fruit exhibited in large quantities were the following:\r\n\r\n\"APPLES.--Duchess of Oldenburg, Red Astracan, Saxton or Fall Stripe,\r\nPlum Cider, Fameuse, Haas, Jefferson County, Perry Russet, American\r\nGolden Russet, Yellow Bellflower, Ramsdale Sweeting, Geniton, Lucy,\r\nWinona Chief, Jonathan, Price's Sweet, Westfield, Seek no Further, Sap,\r\nWagner, Winter Wine Tay, English Golden Russet, Dominie, St. Lawrence,\r\nPomme Gris, Ben Davis, Sweet Pear, and about thirty other varieties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILROAD AND POPULATION

     |  1978\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the report of the railroad commissioner as\r\ngiven above, showing 1978 miles of railroads in Minnesota; there have\r\nbeen 216 miles built in 1877, and 350 miles in 1878--total, 2544 miles\r\nnow operated in the State. In 1862, we had but ten miles of railroad in\r\nMinnesota; in 1878, sixteen years afterwards, two thousand five hundred\r\nand forty-four miles.\r\n\r\nThis past year, the St. Paul & Pacific Railroad has extended its line to\r\nthe British Possessions in Manitoba, connecting with a road there and\r\ngiving us direct railroad communication with the vast country lying\r\nnorth of us; while the Southern Minnesota, the Hastings & Dakota, the\r\nSt. Cloud branch of the St. Paul & Pacific, are extending their lines,\r\nlike arteries, through the heart of the State. In much less than ten\r\nyears, Minnesota will have the most perfect railroad system on this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           POPULATION.\r\n                                                        Number.\r\n  Population in 1870                                   439,706\r\n  Population in 1875                                   597,407\r\n  Population in 1877                                   750,000\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMESTEAD EXEMPTION LAW.\r\n\r\nWe are proud of the Homestead Law of Minnesota. The State says to its\r\ncitizen: you may be unfortunate, even culpably improvident, nevertheless\r\nyou and your family shall not be left homeless or without means to\r\nenable you to retrieve past misfortunes or faults.\r\n\r\nThe law reads--\r\n\r\n     \"That a homestead consisting of any quantity of land not exceeding\r\n     eighty acres, and the dwelling house thereon and its appurtenances,\r\n     to be selected by the owner thereof, and not included in any\r\n     incorporated town, city or village, or instead thereof, at the\r\n     option of the owner, a quantity of land not exceeding in amount one\r\n     lot, being within an incorporated town, city or village, and the\r\n     dwelling house thereon and its appurtenances, owned and occupied by\r\n     any resident of this State, shall not be subject to attachment,\r\n     levy, or sale, upon any execution or any other process issuing out\r\n     of any court within this State. This section shall be deemed and\r\n     construed to exempt such homestead in the manner aforesaid during\r\n     the time it shall be occupied by the widow or minor child or\r\n     children of any deceased person who was, when living, entitled to\r\n     the benefits of this act.\"\r\n\r\nThus the State, in its bountiful protection, says to its citizen, \"You\r\nmay be unfortunate, even blamably improvident, nevertheless the State\r\nshall not allow you and yours to be thrown paupers on the world. Your\r\nhomestead is still left to you, a competency at least.\"\r\n\r\nThere are also reserved for the settler, free from all law processes,\r\nall his household furniture up to the value of $300, 3 horses, or in\r\nlieu 1 horse and yoke of oxen, 2 cows, 11 sheep, 3 hogs, wagon, harness,\r\nand all his farming machinery and implements; also a year's supply of\r\nfamily provisions or growing crops, and fuel, and seed grain not\r\nexceeding 50 bushels each of wheat and oats, 5 of potatoes, and one of\r\ncorn, also mechanics' or miners' tools, with $400 worth of\r\nstock-in-trade, and the library and instruments of professional men.\r\n\r\nThis is the beneficent protection which the State throws around the poor\r\nman's home. Yet there is one way in which he may forfeit it.\r\n\r\nShould he have the misfortune to mortgage his homestead the law can no\r\nlonger protect him; he is in the toils of the money lender, and should\r\npoor crops or other set-backs come to him now, there is every\r\nprobability that he will lose his home.\r\n\r\nWe say to our settlers, avoid this fatal error, misfortune almost always\r\nfollows it; toil, slave, fast, rather than mortgage your homestead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to a very important part of our work. Under this head we\r\nhave made several calculations, for the guidance of the immigrant. They\r\nhave been made with care, and are, we think, as nearly correct as it is\r\npossible to make such calculations. By a careful study of them the\r\nintending immigrant will learn\r\n\r\n  WHAT HE HAS TO DO WHEN HE HAS SECURED HIS LAND.\r\n\r\n  THE VARIOUS MODES HE MAY TAKE TO OPEN HIS FARM.\r\n\r\n  THE EXPENSES INCURRED BY EACH METHOD.\r\n\r\n  THE EXPENSE OF LIVING UNTIL HIS FIRST CROP COMES IN.\r\n\r\nThese, with minor details, we have set forth in the following\r\ncalculations. They embrace the case of the poor man with a small capital\r\nand the man with quite a respectable capital, who may wish to put it in\r\na bank that never fails, and in which he will himself be the director\r\nand owner.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE TABLES CLEARLY SHOW THE LEAST CAPITAL\r\n\r\na man requires to settle in one of our colonies, and also, if he can\r\nafford it, how advantageously he can lay out a considerable sum for\r\nwhich he will receive a quick return.\r\n\r\nWe will take up the poor man's case first, as it is the one we have the\r\nmost interest in, and we land him on his land\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE SPRING.\r\n\r\nHe puts up a very cheap house; by and by, he will have a better\r\none--but, in the meantime, he can make this one comfortable, warm and\r\nclean--much better than a cheap lodging in a city.\r\n\r\nWe will give the dimensions of the house as 16 × 18 ft., to be built of\r\nsingle boards; these to be sodded on the outside to any depth the owner\r\nmay wish. In this way, he can have a house far warmer than a poorly put\r\nup frame house, at the following cost:\r\n\r\n  1,600 feet of lumber                                   $25 00\r\n  2 windows, 2 doors                                       6 50\r\n  Shingles                                                 7 25\r\n                                                         ------\r\n          Total                                          $38 75\r\n\r\nNow, we must furnish the house:\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE FURNITURE.\r\n\r\n  Cooking stove                                          $25 00\r\n  Crockery                                                 5 00\r\n  Chairs                                                   2 00\r\n  Table                                                    2 00\r\n  3 bedsteads                                              9 00\r\n                                                         ------\r\n          Total                                          $43 00\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE AND FARMING IMPLEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  He buys a breaking yoke of oxen, weighing from 3,200\r\n       to 3,400 lbs. at about                           $100 00\r\n  Breaking plow                                           23 00\r\n  Wagon                                                   75 00\r\n                                                        -------\r\n          Total                                         $198 00\r\n\r\nThen he goes to work and breaks up, we will say, 50 acres of land. He\r\nhas to live sixteen months before his principal crop comes in, but he\r\ncan have his potatoes and corn, planted on the sod, within a few months,\r\nto help him out in his living; that is, when he breaks his land the\r\nfirst year, he will plant a portion of it under corn, potatoes, and\r\nother vegetables, sufficient for his own use, and for feed for his\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IT WILL COST HIM TO LIVE.\r\n\r\n  For a family of four, 30 bushels of wheat, ground into flour,\r\n        at $1, a bushel                                          $30 00\r\n  Groceries                                                       15 00\r\n  1 cow for milk                                                  25 00\r\n  Fuel                                                            30 00\r\n                                                                 ------\r\n          Total                                                 $100 00\r\n\r\nHe has besides, vegetables, and corn sufficient, that he raised on his\r\nbreaking, and two hogs that he raised and fattened on the corn, and for\r\nwhich we should have charged him two or three dollars. In the fall, his\r\nhogs weigh 200 lbs. each, and he can sell them or eat them; we recommend\r\nthe latter course.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW HE STANDS THE SECOND SPRING.\r\n\r\n  He has laid out, for a house                                   $38 75\r\n  For Fuel                                                        30 00\r\n   \"  Furniture                                                   43 00\r\n   \"  Cattle and farming implements                              198 00\r\n  Cost of living, including price of cow                         100 00\r\n                                                                -------\r\n          Total                                                 $409 75\r\n\r\nThis sum he will absolutely require to have when he arrives on the land.\r\nTo this, in his calculations, he must add his expenses coming here.\r\n\r\nRailroad fares from different points will be given in another place.\r\n\r\nWe have not here made any calculations in regard to the purchase of his\r\nland, in the first place because the lands are different prices in\r\ndifferent colonies, and secondly because most of our settlers with small\r\nmeans, buy their farms on time, getting very easy terms of payments. All\r\ninformation in this respect will be found in its proper place, when we\r\ncome to speak of our colonies. It must be born in mind (and it may be as\r\nwell said here as elsewhere) that the Catholic Bureau owns no lands; we\r\nbut control them and hold them at their original prices for our\r\nimmigrants. We have also secured advantages in prices and terms of\r\npayment which immigrants cannot get outside of our colonies.\r\n\r\nNow having no crop the first year, he works out in the harvest and earns\r\n$60.00.\r\n\r\nThis he requires now, and more when he puts in his first crop, but, as\r\nhe will get time for some, perhaps all, of the following charges, we\r\nwill not charge them to his original capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SPRING'S WORK AND EXPENSES.\r\n\r\n  1 drag to put in the crop, shaking the seed by hand             $12 00\r\n  Seed wheat for 50 acres. 1 bushel and 2 pecks to the acre        75 00\r\n  Hires his grain cut and bound                                    75 00\r\n  Shocking, stacking, etc., done by exchanging work with neighbors.\r\n  Machine threshing at 5 cents a bushel                            50 00\r\n  Extra labor done by exchanging work.\r\n                                                                 -------\r\n                                                                 $212 00\r\n\r\nWe have now come down to the harvest and the second year on the land\r\n\r\n  Up to this the settler's expenses have been $621 75.\r\n\r\n  Let us see what the land is likely to set off against this sum,\r\n  50 acres of wheat 20 bushels to the acre                     $1,000 00\r\n        Charges                                                   621 75\r\n                                                               ---------\r\n      Balance in favor of crop                                   $378 25\r\n\r\nAdding to this the sixty dollars the man earned the first harvest, he\r\nhas in hand $438.25.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the settler has supported himself and\r\nfamily for sixteen months, his home is made, stock paid for, his farm\r\nopened, and at least $300 added to the value of his land. We will\r\nsuppose that he plows the second year fifty acres more and has one\r\nhundred acres under his second crop. With this good set off, we leave\r\nhim. Now we will give the\r\n\r\n\r\nCASH EXPENSES,\r\n\r\nfor the same number of acres, where a man hires all his work done. He\r\nmay prefer to do this, to buying cattle or horses to break, as he may be\r\na man who can earn high wages, until his first crop comes in.\r\n\r\n  Breaking 50 acres, at $2.50 per acre                    $125 00\r\n  Seed wheat                                                75 00\r\n  Seeding and dragging, at 90 cents per acre                45 00\r\n  Cutting and binding, $1.50 per acre                       75 00\r\n  Stacking, five days, two men and team                     25 00\r\n  Threshing and hauling to market, at 12 cents a bushel    120 00\r\n                                                          -------\r\n      Cash expenses of crop                               $465 00\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS.\r\n\r\n  Fifty acres of wheat, 20 bushels to the acre,\r\n  at $1 per bushel                                      $1,000 00\r\n          Charged to the crop                              465 00\r\n                                                        ---------\r\n  Balance in favor of crop                                $535 00\r\n\r\nNow, the expense of breaking, by right, should not be charged to the\r\nfirst crop, for it is a permanent value, added to the value of the land,\r\nand should be calculated as capital: 50 acres broken on a farm of a 160,\r\nadds fully $2 an acre to the value of the property.\r\n\r\nBut in the above calculation, we have not alone charged the first crop\r\nwith the breaking expenses, but also with the cash price of every\r\ndollar's worth of labor expended, until the wheat is in the railroad\r\nelevator, and the owner has nothing more to do, unless to receive his\r\nmoney for it; and yet there is a clear profit over all expenses of\r\n$535.00.\r\n\r\nIn making these calculations, it is necessary to put a certain value on\r\nthe wheat per bushel, and to allow for a certain amount of bushels to\r\nthe acre, but it will be obvious to any reader that in both these\r\nimportant items there are continual variations.\r\n\r\nThe calculations we now give appeared in the edition of our pamphlet for\r\n1877, and were based, in a measure, on our fine wheat crop for that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe crop of 1878, as we have already stated, fell short of 1877, and\r\nwere we basing our estimate on it we should calculate wheat second grade\r\nat 66 cents per bushel, but the crop of 1879 may surpass the crop of\r\n1877; taking the average of many years' crops and prices, our\r\ncalculations are as near correct as they can be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND CALCULATION OF HOUSE BUILDING.\r\n\r\nIn our calculation of the smallest sum a man would require, coming to\r\nsettle on the land, we made an estimate of a very cheap house indeed,\r\nnevertheless one that can be made warmer than many a more expensive one.\r\nWe give an estimate of the cost of a frame house 16×24, a story and a\r\nhalf high, with a T addition, and a cellar 12 by 16.\r\n\r\nWe give the exact expenses of a house of this kind as it stands at\r\npresent in one of our colonies. It has three rooms up stairs with a\r\nhall, two rooms down stairs with a hall and pantry, and has had one coat\r\nof plaster:\r\n\r\n  Material for house                                       $280\r\n  Work                                                       75\r\n                                                           ----\r\n          Total                                            $355\r\n\r\nA man himself helping, can lessen this item for work, say $25, leaving\r\nthe cost of the house $330.\r\n\r\nIn our first calculation we put down as the lowest sum a man would\r\nrequire to have after his arrival on the land, $409.75. But in this\r\ncalculation we gave him a house, such as it was, for $38.75. Now, if he\r\nwants the better house we have just described, his capital should be\r\n$726.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT A MAN WITH MODERATE CAPITAL CAN DO.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the case of a man with moderate capital, who wishes to\r\nstart with a complete outfit of farming machinery, &c.

One could do the breaking,\r\nwhile the other might be doing some other work.\r\n\r\nIn fact, each man's case has its own peculiar features, which he must\r\nbring his own judgment to bear upon, and we don't pretend to have done\r\nmore than to have given him a good guide to assist him in his\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nTwenty acres would be a pretty fair breaking for a poor man the first\r\nyear, and quite sufficient to enable him to support a small family. We\r\nhave farmers in the woods, now prosperous men, who for years had not\r\nmore than from five to ten acres cleared, for it is hard work to clear\r\nheavy timbered land, and much easier to plant young trees than to cut\r\nold ones down. But heretofore poor men were frequently deterred from\r\ngoing on prairie land on account of the heavy expense attached to\r\nfencing their tillage land. This was about the highest item of expense.\r\nIt is not so now, for in the counties in which our Catholic colonies are\r\nsituated, and in the adjoining counties,\r\n\r\n\r\nA HERD LAW\r\n\r\nis in force, whereby cattle have to be herded during the day, and\r\nconfined within bounds during the night. In this way one man or boy can\r\nherd the cattle of a whole settlement, and the heavy, vexatious and\r\ncontinual tax of fencing is entirely done away with.\r\n\r\nAll the lands in our Catholic colonies are prairie lands, and in the\r\ncolonies and adjoining counties, as we have already stated, the herd law\r\nis in full force.\r\n\r\nNo one, at the present day, who has any experience in farming in the\r\nWest, would settle on an unimproved timber farm. It takes a lifetime to\r\nclear such a farm, and even then a man leaves some stumps for his\r\ngrandchildren to take out. But we earnestly impress upon our settlers\r\nthe necessity of setting out trees around their prairie homes. The rapid\r\ngrowth of trees set out on any of our prairies, is absolutely wonderful.\r\nIn six years after planting, a man will have nice, sheltering, young\r\ngroves, around his house. One of the first things a settler should do\r\nafter breaking up his land is to set out some young trees, which he can\r\nbuy very cheap. All our railroads carry such freight free. If he cannot\r\nget the trees he can sow the seed, which will do as well.\r\n\r\nFor comfort on a prairie, trees are a necessity; but it is worse than\r\nuseless, it is loss of time, to set them out, unless they are taken care\r\nof: give them solitude, and keep the weeds and cattle from them for a\r\nlittle while, and they will soon be able to take care of themselves.\r\nCord-wood can be bought at any of the railroad stations in our colonies\r\nat an average of about five dollars a cord.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter which may well come under the head of general\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nWhile we have shown by figures the good profits which may be calculated\r\nupon by an industrious farmer, still, he must not look for a great\r\nincrease of money capital, for some years at least.\r\n\r\nWhile he will be enabled under God, by industry, sobriety and\r\nperseverance to give his family a good, comfortable living, it must be\r\nto the increase in the value of his farm each year, that he must look\r\nfor an increase of capital, to that and the increase of his\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVE STOCK.\r\n\r\nAbove all things, he must attend to the latter; it is almost incredible\r\nthe way young stock will increase. A man starting with one cow will have\r\nhis yard full of young stock in a few years by raising the calves that\r\ncome to him.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that men who came to this State without any means whatever,\r\nand settled on land, are to-day among our most prosperous farmers; but\r\nthey came uninvited, at their own risk, and if they had failed, they\r\ncould only blame themselves.\r\n\r\nThe case is altogether different in regard to persons coming to our\r\nCatholic colonies. They come invited, and depending upon the information\r\nwe give to them; therefore, there must be no misunderstanding on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nWe say to the immigrant, with the capital we have specified, you can\r\nopen a farm in Minnesota, and if you are industrious, brave and hopeful,\r\nwe promise you, under God, an independent home. If you come without this\r\ncapital, you do so at your own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHOLIC COLONIES IN MINNESOTA.\r\n\r\n     LOCATION, POPULATION, SOIL, TOWNS, EXTRACTS FROM INTERESTING\r\n     LETTERS FROM RESIDENTS, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to speak of our Catholic Colonies. In doing so we will be as\r\naccurate and as truthful as it is possible to be. At the same time we\r\nrecognize the difficulty of making others see things as we see them,\r\nthey are too apt to draw imaginary pictures from our facts. For instance\r\nwhen we speak of settled communities and towns, it should be borne in\r\nmind that our oldest settlement was only opened in the spring of 1876,\r\nour two latest in the spring of 1878, and that both farms and towns\r\nexhibit the rough, unfinished appearance of new places in the West,\r\nwhich it takes time, perseverance and industry to mould into thrifty\r\ncomeliness; with the aid of the two latter (perseverance and industry)\r\nthe former (time) will be but a very short period indeed. We have now\r\nfour Catholic Colonies in Minnesota, two in the western and two in the\r\nsouthwestern part of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWIFT COUNTY COLONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the oldest and doubtless best known of our colonies. The colony\r\nlands commence 120 miles west of St. Paul and extend for 30 miles on\r\neach side of the St. Paul and Pacific railroad. Within the bounds of the\r\ncolony are four railroad towns, one of them, Benson, being the county\r\nseat; but the two colony towns proper, are De Graff and Clontarf, being\r\norganized and run, as they say out West, by our own people.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Swift County Colony may very well be spoken of as two colonies,\r\nfor the present under one name, the Chippewa River dividing the colony\r\nlands about in the center, having De Graff on the east and Clontarf on\r\nthe west. Each town too, has its own Catholic church, congregation and\r\nresident priest--the Rev. F. J. Swift, pastor at De Graff, and the Rev.\r\nA. Oster, pastor at Clontarf.\r\n\r\nThe colony lands on the east side of the Chippewa, stretch out from the\r\ntown of De Graff, 18 miles in length and 12 miles in width, and Clontarf\r\nlands on the west side of the river, have equal proportions.\r\n\r\nThis division and explanation may be of service to correspondents, some\r\nof whom frequently write to one or other of the resident priests, for\r\ninformation, in preference to writing direct to the Catholic Bureau, in\r\nSt. Paul.\r\n\r\nWhen Bishop Ireland in 1876, got control of the unsold railroad lands\r\nwithin the present bounds of Swift County Colony, there was a large\r\nquantity of Government lands lying beside these railroad lands, and open\r\nfor homestead and pre-emption entries, so that a great number of our\r\npeople were able to secure farms of 80 and 160 acres by merely paying\r\nthe fees of the U. S. Land Office.\r\n\r\nEarly settlers too, on the railroad lands, had an opportunity by paying\r\ncash to get their farms much below the market value, for the St. Paul\r\nand Pacific Railroad Company (the owner) having fallen behind hand in\r\npaying the interest on its bonds held by foreign capitalists, these\r\nbonds became depreciated in the market, but were, nevertheless, good for\r\ntheir full amount, in payment of the lands belonging to the company.\r\n\r\nIn this way we were enabled in the first edition of our pamphlet for the\r\nyear 1877, to offer lands, much below, in some instances more than half\r\nbelow, their average value; but as prices depend altogether on the\r\nmarket value of the bonds, a value which is always fluctuating, we deem\r\nit unwise to bind ourselves to arbitrary prices. The average railroad\r\nprice of lands in Swift County Colony is $6.50 per acre; the actual cash\r\nprice, by buying bonds and paying for the land with same, will be much\r\nless than this, and we will, when called upon get the bonds for the\r\nimmigrant at their then value, but what the exact prices of the bonds\r\nmay be or how long they will remain in the market available for the\r\npurchase of land, we cannot take upon ourselves to say.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we wish to point out to immigrants, that irrespective\r\nof paying for land in bonds, for which they must pay cash, they can make\r\ncontracts, on long time, with the company, for their farms.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways too by which our people can make homes in this\r\nwell-settled colony. Non-Catholics who were settled in the county before\r\nthe colony was established, will be willing to sell out. Homesteaders,\r\ntoo, who got their land free from the government, and made improvements,\r\nare frequently anxious to realize a little capital by the sale of those\r\nimproved farms, and go still farther west. There is also a large\r\nquantity of school and State lands in the county, which will be in the\r\nmarket in 1879; so notwithstanding that the greater part of the colony\r\nrailroad lands have passed from the control of the Bureau into the\r\npossession of settlers, and that all the government lands have been\r\ntaken up, we look forward, with pleasure, to see many more of our people\r\nsettling in Swift county next spring. They will find a goodly number of\r\ntheir co-religionists settled before them and anxious to give them a\r\nfriendly welcome. There are very few of the New England or Middle States\r\nthat have not representatives in the colony.\r\n\r\nFrom a communication received from the Register of the United States\r\nLand Office at Benson, the county seat, we find that since the Bureau\r\nopened this colony in 1876, 425 Catholic settlers have taken up\r\ngovernment land in the colony; of these, 300 families were Irish, the\r\nremainder Germans, Poles and French. About an equal number of\r\nCatholics--a large majority Irish--have taken railroad lands--80,000\r\nacres of which have been sold; so that we can claim at least 800\r\nCatholic settlers, with their families, in Swift County Colony at the\r\npresent writing. Driving west from De Graff to Clontarf, seventeen\r\nmiles, and still eleven miles farther west from Clontarf to the _Pomme\r\nde Terre_ River, one is never out of sight of a settler's house; and\r\nsome of those farm houses would be a credit to a much older settlement,\r\nfor we have settlers who farm as much as five hundred acres, while\r\nothers again farm but eighty acres. The general quality of the soil is a\r\ndark loam, slightly mixed with sand and with a clay sub-soil, admirably\r\nadapted for wheat, oats, &c., &c., while the bountiful supply of good\r\nwater and the large quantity of natural meadow lands, scattered all over\r\nthe colony--there is scarcely a quarter section (160 acres) without its\r\npatch of natural meadow--give the settler an opportunity to combine\r\nstock raising and tillage on his farm.\r\n\r\nThe village or town of De Graff has a railroad depot and telegraph\r\noffice; a grain elevator, with steam power--which is the same as saying,\r\na cash market for all farm produce--six or seven stores, with the\r\ngeneral merchandise found in a country town; lumber yard, machine\r\nwarehouse, blacksmith, carpenter and wagon maker shops; an immigrant\r\nhouse, where persons in search of land can lodge their families until\r\nthey are suited; a resident doctor, and resident priest, Rev. F. J.\r\nSwift; a fine commodious church; a handsome school house and pastor's\r\nresidence. No saloon. The business men of the town are our own people,\r\nand a Catholic fair, for the benefit of the new church, held last fall,\r\nand patronized exclusively by the colonists, netted $1,000 clear.\r\n\r\nTraveling along the railroad and passing through Benson, half way\r\nbetween De Graff and Clontarf, we come to the latter, the youngest town\r\nin this young settlement, but it has a very fine class of settlers\r\naround it: west of the village the land is as fine as any in the State,\r\nknown as the Hancock Ridge.\r\n\r\nClontarf has two general stores, a grain elevator, an immigrant house, a\r\nrailroad depot, blacksmith shop, a large church and a very handsome\r\nresidence for the priest, the Rev. A. Oster. No part of the colony is\r\nsettling up more rapidly than the portion around Clontarf and several\r\nnew buildings will go up in the village next summer. Swift County Colony\r\nis fast beginning to wear the features of a settled community. Many of\r\nour farmers have harvested this year their second crop; our merchants\r\nreport that they are doing a lively business; bridges are being built,\r\nroads laid out, plans of improvement discussed by the settlers; and we\r\nchallenge any part of the West to produce a more intelligent rural\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nTrue to the memory of the old land and their love for their church, the\r\nsettlers have given familiar names to many of the townships in the\r\ncolony, such as Kildare, Cashel, Dublin, Clontarf, Tara, St. Michaels,\r\nSt. Josephs, St. Francis, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, running through the whole length of\r\nthe colony, has, by its late extension, become one of the great railroad\r\nthoroughfares of the northwest, and added much to the value of the\r\ncolony lands. Commencing at St. Paul, the capital of Minnesota, it\r\ncrosses the Northern Pacific at Glyndon in this State and continues on\r\nto St. Vincent, situated on the line separating the State of Minnesota\r\nand the British Possessions in Manitoba. Here it connects with a\r\nrailroad just completed and running to Winnipeg, the capital of the\r\nBritish province of Manitoba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRACEVILLE COLONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis colony is located in Big Stone County, west of Swift. It is our\r\nHomestead Colony, and one which we feel very proud of. What is thought\r\nof Big Stone County by Western men, in connection with stock raising, is\r\nshown by the following extract from a published communication.\r\n\r\n\"Stock raising now receives more attention from the prairie farmers than\r\never before, since the erroneous impression heretofore existing that the\r\nwintering of cattle was too expensive, has been entirely disproved.\r\nNumbers of settlers from the lower part of our State, and from Iowa,\r\nhave removed to Big Stone County with large droves of cattle, that they\r\nherd on the vast natural meadows of that county, which also furnish all\r\nthe necessary hay for winter food.\" We will add to this, that the soil\r\nof Big Stone County, for agricultural purposes, is deemed as good as any\r\nin the State, without exception.\r\n\r\nThe lands in the county being government lands, we could not of course\r\nhave any control of them, they were open to all comers; but by prompt\r\naction the Bureau located during the months of March, April and May, one\r\nhundred and seventy-five families in the county. Many of those colonists\r\nwere poor people who were induced to leave Minnesota towns and settle on\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBut we will let a resident of the colony, one who has examined every\r\nquarter section in it and materially aided in its settlement, speak for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a letter from us, Col. J. R. King, a resident of\r\nGraceville, and a practical surveyor, who has acted as agent for the\r\nBureau since the opening of the colony, writes:\r\n\r\n\"During the months of March and April, 1878, a great number of claims\r\nfor our people were entered in the United States Land Office, but before\r\nany of them come on to their lands, Bishop Ireland shipped, in March,\r\nfive car loads of lumber for erecting a church building; the church was\r\ncommenced the same month and completed, in the rough, in about three\r\nweeks. This is the first instance, in my knowledge, where a church was\r\nerected in advance of settlement. Our Right Rev. Bishop must have had a\r\nforeknowledge of what was to follow.\r\n\r\n\"In the short space of three months there was built, in a radius of six\r\nmiles from Graceville Church, over 150 comfortable cabins, and on each\r\nclaim from five to ten acres broken for a garden and planted with\r\npotatoes, corn, beans, turnips, &c., &c., which yielded quite a good\r\nsupply for the present winter. Our colonists had the advantage of being\r\nearly on the ground and had their gardens planted in May.\r\n\r\n\"The colonists broke during last summer from fifteen to thirty acres per\r\nman, so that next spring they will be able to get in wheat sufficient to\r\ncarry them through the second winter handsomely. They are all in the\r\nvery best spirits and could not be induced to return to the cities--for\r\nthey already feel independent and masters of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"The soil here is splendid and the country beautiful. Gently rolling\r\nprairie, with numerous ponds or small lakes and plenty of the finest\r\nhay.\r\n\r\n\"The balance of Big Stone County, outside of our colony, has all been\r\ntaken up; a large majority of the claims occupied and substantial\r\nimprovements made by the settlers, who are first class. Traverse County,\r\nadjoining us on the north, is fast filling up.\r\n\r\n\"I must not forget to say that we have good water in abundance; my own\r\nwell is sixteen feet deep, with as fine, pure water as ever was found.\r\n\r\n\"And now to tell you about our little village, Graceville, named in\r\nhonor of our revered Bishop, the Right Rev. Thos. L. Grace. It is\r\nbeautifully situated on the north shore of one of the two large lakes\r\nknown as Tokua Lakes, and has three general stores, one hotel, one\r\nblacksmith and wagon shop, a very handsome little church and the\r\npriest's residence attached. Around the lake is a fine belt of timber\r\nwhich adds much to the beauty of the place. The village is 26 miles due\r\neast from Morris, on the St. Paul & Pacific Railroad, but the Hastings &\r\nDakota Railroad, now built close to the line, will run through our\r\ncounty next summer; by and by we will have a cross road running through\r\nthe colony lands.\r\n\r\n\"Our resident pastor is the Rev. A. V. Pelisson, a veteran missionary,\r\nwho is doing a wonderful deal of good, temporal and spiritual, among his\r\npeople, and is 'the right man in the right place,' full of energy and\r\nzeal.\r\n\r\n\"The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is offered up in our church every day,\r\nand on Sundays we have High Mass, for Graceville has a sweet church\r\nchoir.\r\n\r\n\"It is most edifying to see the crowd of men, women and children who\r\nflock in from all points of the compass to church on Sundays. Father\r\nPelisson had the first temporary church taken down and in its place he\r\nhas erected one of the prettiest and neatest churches in the State; a\r\ncredit both to the good father and his people who so cheerfully assisted\r\nin its erection, under many difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"From the roof of the church I can count to-day over 70 houses where\r\nlast March there was nothing but a bare prairie. If God prospers our\r\npeople next season with good crops, they will be over their\r\ndifficulties, in a fair way to prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not know that we have anything to add to Col. King's very graphic\r\nand truthful statement in regard to Graceville Colony and the prospects\r\nof its settlers, very many of whom were so poor when they went in, that\r\nit required Western pluck to face the prairie. The building of the\r\nHastings & Dakota Railroad last summer, giving them employment, was a\r\ngreat help.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they had and will have a rough time of it for a little longer,\r\nbut, they are toiling with hope, with the hope of an honest independence\r\nin the future. And with this hope in his heart, the settler toils and\r\nfeels himself \"every inch a man.\"\r\n\r\nTraverse County, mentioned in Col. King's letter, has, at the present\r\nwriting, a large quantity of government land open to homestead and\r\npre-emption entries. (See the Homestead Law in another place.) There is\r\nno doubt too, but that persons, during the land excitement last year,\r\nmade government claims in Big Stone County--some within the colony\r\nbounds--which, from one cause or another, they will neglect to hold, by\r\nnot fulfilling the conditions required by the law governing such claims.\r\nIn all cases of the kind the lands revert to the government and are\r\nagain subject to entry. Yet, so rapidly are those lands taken up that we\r\ncannot promise to our people, coming from the East, that when they\r\narrive, they will find any homestead land adjoining or within any of our\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. ADRIAN COLONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis colony, situated in Nobles County, in the southwestern portion of\r\nthe State, close to the State line of Iowa, on the Luverne and Sioux\r\nFalls branch of the Sioux City and St. Paul Railroad, was opened in\r\nSeptember, 1877.\r\n\r\nBefore going into details in regard to the colony we will give some\r\nextracts from an article (lately published) treating of southwestern\r\nMinnesota, where, as we have stated, St. Adrian colony is located.\r\n\r\n\"Southwestern Minnesota has made rapid progress in stock raising. As\r\ncapital increases, and the utility and profit of stock raising become\r\nbetter understood by the farmer, we shall see fine flocks and herds, in\r\naddition to the fields of waving grain, and our rich prairies teeming\r\nwith the life they can so amply sustain. The abundance of clear, sweet\r\nwater, dry atmosphere, its elevation, rich pasturage, freedom from\r\ndisease, and direct and ready access to all the prominent markets, unite\r\nto make Minnesota the paradise of stock raisers. Good hay can be put in\r\nthe stack in Southwestern Minnesota for $1.25 per ton. It can be secured\r\nwithout other expense than cutting, and with very little labor, enough\r\ncan be made for the maintenance of a large amount of stock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"This section has been settled but seven years, yet it is already\r\nteeming with a population of wide-awake, industrious people, whose\r\nfields are evidences of the innate wealth of the region. The soil of\r\nSouthwestern Minnesota is adapted to the successful cultivation of\r\ngrain, and so celebrated has its grain producing qualities become, that\r\ncapitalists have put their money into large tracts of land, and have now\r\nimmense fields under cultivation, and their investments have proven\r\nextremely profitable. There are farms of 600, 1,000 and 2,000 acres, all\r\nproducing Minnesota's great staple, wheat. Every year, as the success of\r\nthese investments becomes known, new and large farms are opening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Southwestern Minnesota is on the move, and to those who wish to locate\r\nin a thriving, driving, pushing, growing country, no locality on the\r\ngreen earth promises more faithfully, and none will redeem its pledges\r\nwith greater pride to the wide-awake, stirring husbandman. The very\r\nsoil teams with wealth, and the air is laden with the most precious\r\ngifts of health.\"\r\n\r\nMaking allowance for the rather high coloring of the above extracts, its\r\nfacts are correct. Southwestern Minnesota has many advantages for stock\r\nraising, its soil is good, none better. Stock raising has been carried\r\non successfully there to the advantage of a great many poor settlers,\r\nand men of wealth have opened large grain farms in this section of the\r\nState; the largest of these farms adjoins the colony lands of St.\r\nAdrian.\r\n\r\nOf the 70,000 acres of railroad land which Bishop Ireland holds the\r\ncontrol of for colony purposes, 22,000 acres have been sold to settlers.\r\n\r\nThe colony lands adjoin the railroad town of Adrian. A little over a\r\nyear ago it had three houses, now it is one of the brightest, liveliest,\r\nmost bustling little burgs in Southwestern Minnesota. But, as in the\r\ncase of Graceville, we will let a resident of St. Adrian speak for the\r\ntown and colony. The following is an extract from a letter which we\r\nreceived the other day from the Rev. C. J. Knauf, the pastor in charge\r\nof the St. Adrian colony.\r\n\r\nFather Knauf resides in the town of Adrian--where immigrants, bound for\r\nthe colony, leave the train--and takes an active part in locating\r\nimmigrants. Father Knauf writes:\r\n\r\n\"The village of Adrian consisted of three houses when I came here,\r\nSeptember 20, 1877, one year and three months ago to-morrow; now there\r\nare 68 houses in the village. We have three hotels, one restaurant (no\r\nbeer,) three lumber yards, one steam feed mill, four general stores, one\r\ndrug, two hardware stores, one jewelry store, one barber shop, one large\r\nlivery stable, two furniture dealers, four dealers in farming machinery,\r\none shoe maker, one tailor, three blacksmiths, one carpenter shop, four\r\nwheat and produce buyers; a public school house, costing $1,800; a\r\nCatholic Church, well finished, and the pastor's house, the latter\r\ncosting $1,840.\r\n\r\n\"I sold, up to date, 22,000 acres of land. Thousands of acres were\r\nbroken last season. I was the first Catholic to arrive here: now we have\r\nsixty Catholic families in the colony. Next spring we will have 160\r\nCatholic families, for a great many bought farms last year, had breaking\r\ndone--some broke extensively, others moderately--and will move on, with\r\ntheir families, to their new farms, next spring, in time to put in their\r\nfirst crop.\"\r\n\r\nIn explanation of that portion of Father Knauf's letter which speaks of\r\nparties who have purchased farms in the colony but who have not moved on\r\nto them as yet, we will say, that since the Bureau, at the solicitation\r\nof many correspondents, agreed to have land selected and contracts made\r\nout for persons anxious to secure land in some one of our colonies, and\r\nyet unable, from one cause or another, to come on immediately; a great\r\nmany have adopted this mode to get land.\r\n\r\nWe find from Father Knauf's letter that he has on his books the names of\r\none hundred families who have secured land in St. Adrian colony, and\r\nwill move on to their new homes next spring, so that he is looking\r\nforward to very lively times.\r\n\r\nThere is also coming out to St. Adrian Colony in the spring a\r\nbrave-hearted little lady from Brooklyn, N. Y., to get in her first\r\ncrop, and put up her first farm house. She was on here last summer,\r\nspent a month or so at St. Adrian, bought 270 acres of land, left money\r\nto pay for the breaking of 200 acres, and will come on to settle in the\r\nspring. She has no doubt but that she will make the venture pay, and\r\nprefers to make the trial rather than have her money bearing small\r\ninterest in the East.\r\n\r\nLands sell in the colony from $5 to $7.50 per acre. A discount of 20 per\r\ncent. from these prices is allowed for cash. The conditions for time\r\ncontracts are as follows: At time of purchase, one-tenth of principal\r\nand interest on unpaid principal; second year, interest only; third year\r\none-fourth of remaining principal and interest on unpaid principal; same\r\nfor three ensuing years: after the expiration of which the full price of\r\nthe land is paid.\r\n\r\nAs an instance, showing the value set on land in this part of Minnesota,\r\nwe will state, that school lands, sold last spring, at public sale, in\r\nthe neighborhood of St. Adrian, brought from $7.50 to $17 per acre: the\r\nprice obtained heretofore having been $5 per acre.\r\n\r\nOn stepping from the train at St. Adrian, last summer, one witnessed a\r\nscene of bustle and activity similar to those frequently described by\r\nwriters in sketches of Western life in new settlements, with some\r\nimportant exceptions, for neither in Adrian nor in any of the towns\r\nunder the control of the Catholic Bureau, can there be found rowdies,\r\nnor the saloons that vomit them forth. This fact may take from the\r\ndramatic effect of such sketches, but it is the anchor of family unity\r\nand love, the harbinger of prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe town of Adrian is 197 miles from St. Paul. A daily train from St.\r\nPaul to Sioux Falls, D. T., passes through it; it has also railroad\r\ncommunication with Sioux City, Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe lands of the colony are first-class, both for agriculture and stock\r\nraising: and to those of fair capital we strongly recommend St. Adrian\r\nColony.\r\n\r\nThe colonists are German and Irish Catholics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAVOCA COLONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the latest opened of our colonies, Bishop Ireland having only\r\nsecured control of the lands last April. It is situated in Murray County\r\n(Southwestern Minnesota,) adjoining Nobles County on the north, and in\r\nthe whole 52,000 acres of land secured by the Bishop for the colony, we\r\nvery much doubt if one poor section (640 acres) could be found, nor do\r\nwe suppose that any of the land will remain unsold by the 1st of next\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nWhile the beauty of the location and fertility of the soil, make Avoca\r\none of the most desirable locations in Minnesota, the easy terms on\r\nwhich a farm can be secured, are additional and substantial advantages\r\nfor men of small means.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the colony--the village of Avoca, situated on a beautiful\r\nlake--is just twenty miles from Heron Lake, a station on the St. Paul\r\nand Sioux City Railroad, 160 miles southwest of St. Paul; but the\r\nSouthern Minnesota Railroad, which will give this portion of the State a\r\ndirect communication with the Milwaukee and Chicago markets, is now\r\ncompleted to within forty-five miles of Avoca, and we expect to see it\r\nrunning through our colony lands by next fall. This will give to the\r\nsettlers in Avoca Colony, a direct southern route to Chicago, and a\r\nchoice of markets for their produce: the latter an advantage which\r\nfarmers can well appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe price of lands in the colony are from $5 to $6.50 per acre, on the\r\nfollowing easy terms of payment. At the time of purchase, interest only,\r\none year in advance, seven per cent., is required; at the end of one\r\nyear, interest only for another year; at the end of two years, one-tenth\r\nof the principal, and a year's interest on the balance; at the end of\r\nthree years, one-tenth of the principal, and interest on balance; at the\r\nend of each year thereafter, twenty per cent. of the principal, and\r\ninterest on balance; until all is paid.\r\n\r\nWe subjoin a practical illustration of these terms:\r\n\r\nWe will say that January, 1879, a man contracts for 80 acres of land at\r\n$5 per acre, this will come to $400, with 7 per cent. interest, which\r\nsums he will have to pay as follows:\r\n\r\n  Jan. 1st, 1879, At time of purchase, one year's interest\r\n                    in advance, at 7 per cent.                    $28 00\r\n\r\n  Jan. 1st, 1880, One year's interest in advance,\r\n                    at 7 per cent.                                 28 00\r\n\r\n  Jan. 1st, 1881, Ten per cent. of principal.             $40 00\r\n                  One year's interest on balance $360,\r\n                    at 7 per ct.                           25 20\r\n                                                          ------   65 20\r\n\r\n  Jan. 1st, 1882, Ten per cent. of principal.              40 00\r\n                  One year's interest on balance $320,\r\n                    at 7 per ct.                           22 40\r\n                                                          ------   62 40\r\n\r\n  Jan. 1st, 1883, Twenty per cent. of principal.           80 00\r\n                  One year's interest on balance $240,\r\n                    at 7 per ct.                           16 80\r\n                                                          ------   96 80\r\n\r\n  Jan. 1st, 1884, Twenty per cent. of principal.           80 00\r\n                  One year's interest on balance $160,\r\n                    at 7 per ct.                           11 20\r\n                                                          ------   91 20\r\n\r\n  Jan. 1st, 1885, Twenty per cent. of principal.           80 00\r\n                  One year's interest on balance $80,\r\n                    at 7 per ct.                            5 60\r\n                                                          ------   85 60\r\n\r\n  Jan. 1st, 1886, Twenty per cent. of principal.                   80 00\r\n                                                                  ------\r\n            Total.                                               $537 20\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the terms is, that the principal payments are all\r\npostponed until the farmer has had time to raise several crops from his\r\nland. A quarter-section of land will support a family, pay for itself,\r\nleave after seven years a balance in cash, and be worth more than twice\r\nits original value.\r\n\r\nWe have already selected several 80 and 160 acre farms in Avoca for\r\npersons not in a position to come on immediately to the land. Now let us\r\nexplain how this operates.\r\n\r\nAn intending immigrant writes to the Bureau to have 80 acres of land in\r\nAvoca at $5 per acre, selected for him, (as a general rule a man should\r\ntake a quarter-section, 160 acres, by doing so he will be likely to have\r\nboth meadow and tillage land on his farm.) For those 80 acres, he pays\r\ndown, before getting his contract from the railroad company, one year's\r\ninterest, $28. He writes on then, next spring, to the Bureau, to have 30\r\nacres of his land broken and ready for a crop the following\r\nspring--1880. His breaking will cost at $2.50 per acre, $75. He will\r\nhave paid the first year $103, and have his land ready for the seed; he\r\ncomes on then the second spring, 1880, pays $28, another year's\r\ninterest, to the railroad company, puts in his crop and has it saved and\r\nready for market in August. Up to this time--not calculating the\r\nexpenses chargeable to the crop, which we have estimated already in\r\nanother place--he has paid out $131, and has his farm opened and in a\r\nfair way to pay for itself.\r\n\r\nIn soil and location the Colony of Avoca is not surpassed in the\r\nNorthwest. Nine miles from the village of Avoca there is a large body of\r\ntimber. Settlers can also get coal from Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Chas. Koeberl is pastor of the colony, address, Avoca, Murray\r\nCounty, Minnesota. He writes to us under date of December 20th, 1878:\r\n\r\n\"In regard to this colony it promises, thank God, to be a great success.\r\nSince June, when the land sales commenced, we have sold 9,850 acres, and\r\nforty-five Catholic families are preparing to move into the colony next\r\nspring. Immigrants will have in our village of Avoca, a building where\r\nthey can leave their families until they have put up their houses, also\r\na boarding house and store.\r\n\r\n\"In speaking of our climate you can boast honestly of its health. Among\r\n200 families belonging to my missionary district, I have not known of\r\none case of internal disease, during my seven months' stay here. It\r\nwould be well to particularly mention in your forthcoming pamphlet, that\r\nthis is a prairie, not a timber county. I receive so many letters asking\r\nabout the cost of clearings, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\"I expect quite a rush for land in Avoca, next spring, and will be glad\r\nif our people come on early, in time to plant potatoes, corn, &c.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn bringing this brief review of our Catholic colonies to a close, we\r\nagain thank the Catholic press of this country, for its honest advocacy\r\nof Catholic immigration to the land. The favorable notices its editors\r\nhave given to our humble labors in our own field of duty, and the\r\nservice rendered to our work thereby, can never be forgotten by us.\r\n\r\nOur friend, P. Hickey, Esq., editor of the _Catholic Review_, came\r\nspecially from New York, last summer to visit our colonies, to judge for\r\nhimself; and what he saw, the favorable impressions he carried away with\r\nhim, together with sound argument in favor of Catholic colonization,\r\nhave appeared, from time to time, since his return, in able and lucid\r\narticles from his pen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGod has blessed our labors beyond our expectations. We see our colonies\r\nfast merging into settled communities, where honest labor goes hand in\r\nhand with religion, and where men work not for a mere pittance from a\r\nmaster's hand, to support them for a day or a week, but with the hope,\r\nthe prospect, of an inheritance for their children, in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEST TIME TO COME.\r\n\r\n     WHEN TO COME, WHAT TO BRING--WHO SHOULD COME. RAILROAD FARES FROM\r\n     DIFFERENT POINTS--HALF FARES FROM ST. PAUL TO OUR COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE TO CALL IN ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\nDecidedly the best time for the emigrant to come to Minnesota is the\r\nspring. If possible, he should not arrive later than the first week in\r\nMay. He should have his land selected in time to commence to break for\r\ngarden stuff and corn about the 20th of May, then he can continue to\r\nbreak, for his next year's wheat crop, up to the early part of July.\r\n\r\nThe month of June is the month for breaking, for then the grass is young\r\nand succulent, and will rot readily. A man coming in the early part of\r\nJune can have land broken for his next year's crop, but he loses the\r\nadvantages of garden stuff and sod corn to help him out in his living\r\nuntil his first crop comes in.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TO BRING.\r\n\r\nAll your bedding that is of value. All your bedclothes. All wearing\r\napparel, good clothing of every description: nothing more. Do not think\r\nof bringing stoves, nor any kind of house furniture. You can get all\r\nsuch at the stores in the colonies, or here in St. Paul, new, for nearly\r\nwhat the freight on your old furniture, worthless and broken, perhaps,\r\nby the time it arrived here, would come to. The better way is to sell\r\nwhat you have in this line, before leaving, and buy here.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO SHOULD COME.\r\n\r\nWe intend that our closing remarks shall treat fully and clearly on this\r\nvery important portion of our subject. They will be found under the head\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER FOR ALL TO READ.\r\n\r\nHere we will but say what we have already written.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE INVITE FARMERS ONLY\r\n\r\nto our colonies.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the country builds up the town, and we look for quite a\r\nbuilding up of our young Catholic towns next summer; but, in the way of\r\nbusiness, stores and mechanics' shops, the home supply is generally\r\nfully up to the demand, and at present we would not feel justified in\r\ninviting any one to our Catholic colonies but a man\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO WANTS A FARM,\r\n\r\nAnd who is able and willing to work one.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILROAD FARES FROM DIFFERENT POINTS.\r\n\r\n                        1st Class.  2d Class.   Immigrant.\r\n  New York                $35 25     $30 25      $24 00\r\n  Philadelphia             33 50      28 45       24 00\r\n  Montreal                 36 25      26 00\r\n  Toronto                  29 25      23 00\r\n  Buffalo                  29 25      23 00\r\n  Cleveland                25 25      20 00\r\n  Chicago                  15 25      12 00\r\n  Milwaukee                12 25       9 00\r\n\r\nN. B.--The above are the fares from the points mentioned to St. Paul.\r\nDoubtless persons coming in a large party from the same place would get\r\nspecial low rates. From St. Paul to any of our colonies, immigrants are\r\ncarried for half fare; about $3 for an adult. They also get low rates\r\nfor baggage &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE TO GO ON ARRIVING IN ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\nImmigrants, on arriving in St. Paul, will immediately report themselves\r\nat the Catholic Colonization Office, situated in the basement of the\r\nCathedral school building, corner of Sixth and Wabashaw streets. There\r\nthey will be received by an agent of the Bureau, who will give them all\r\nnecessary information and instructions, also half-fare tickets to\r\nrailroad points in the Catholic colonies, and procure for them\r\nhalf-freight charges on goods and extra baggage. Office hours from 8\r\no'clock A. M. to 6 o'clock P. M.\r\n\r\nAll communications should be addressed to\r\n\r\n  THE CATHOLIC COLONIZATION BUREAU,\r\n                       St. Paul, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER FOR ALL TO READ.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wish that this concluding chapter of our pamphlet may be read\r\ncarefully, and thought well over by intending immigrants.\r\n\r\nWe wish it for their benefit, and our own benefit and protection. It is,\r\nwe might say, a fearful responsibility to advise another in a matter\r\nwhich contemplates a change in his habits, mode of life, and home, and\r\nsuch a change should never be undertaken, especially by a man of family,\r\nwithout a most thorough investigation, not alone as to the place he\r\nintends going to, but likewise as to his own fitness for the change.\r\n\r\nWhen you have examined this pamphlet from cover to cover, then commence\r\nan examination of yourself, not forgetting your wife, if you have one,\r\nwho is part of you, and a very important part in connection with this\r\nquestion of your going upon land.\r\n\r\nThis is especially necessary if you and your wife have lived for years\r\nin a city and become habituated to city life. It is a great change from\r\ncity life in the East to country life in the West, especially when the\r\npart of the country one moves to is new and settlements just forming.\r\n\r\nYou are not to expect to realize the advantages of the change right off;\r\nit is through yourself, through your own grit and industry, those\r\nadvantages must come.\r\n\r\nTo a Western farmer there is nothing bleak or lonely in a prairie; to a\r\nman coming fresh from a city and looking on it, for the first time, with\r\ncity eyes, it may, very likely, seem both. Indeed, a sense of loneliness\r\nakin to despondency is a feeling which the newly-arrived immigrant has\r\ngenerally to contend against, a feeling which may increase to a perfect\r\nscare if he is a man anxious to consult Tom, Dick and Harry--who are\r\nalways on hand--as to the wisdom of the step he has just taken.\r\n\r\nWe speak from experience, from facts we have a personal knowledge of.\r\nOur labors in the cause of immigration have brought to us much happiness\r\nand some pain.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Two immigrants arrived here last year, in high spirits,\r\ncalled at our office a few minutes after landing, and so impatient were\r\nthey to go hunt up land that they were quite disappointed to find they\r\nwould have to stop over one night in St. Paul. Well, the next morning\r\nthey called at the office again, all courage, all desire to go upon land\r\nwilted out of them, and informed us that they had changed their minds\r\nand were going back to Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWhy? Well, they had met a man at the boarding house they stopped over\r\nnight at, who advised them not to go out and settle on a prairie. He\r\ntold them, too, that \"he was fifteen years in Minnesota and never could\r\nget a dollar ahead.\"\r\n\r\nNow here were men, rational to all appearance, having traveled two\r\nthousand miles or so to settle upon land, when they came within sight of\r\nthe land, as we may say, losing all desire to visit it, all courage, all\r\nconfidence in disinterested, experienced friends, and in the information\r\nthey gave to them; in everything but the word of a loafer, who never did\r\na day's good in his life, nor never will, and who was anxious to shuffle\r\noff the onus of his slipshod condition from himself to the country.\r\n\r\nHere is another case, which occurred a few months after Swift Colony was\r\nopened and while the country around looked still wild and lonely.\r\n\r\nTwo men arrived here from Philadelphia. They went on to the Catholic\r\ncolony in Swift County, and in a day or two returned, saying that they\r\nhad made up their minds to go back to Philadelphia. Why? Did they not\r\nfind everything as it was reported to them? \"Oh, yes, the land was good,\r\nand there was a good chance for a poor man to make a home on it, if he\r\ncould content himself, but it was too lonely for them.\"\r\n\r\nLonely, to be sure it was; with the noise of the city still ringing in\r\ntheir ears, with its crowds and its gaslights still in their eyes, these\r\nmen found the prairie lonely, and without pausing to consider all the\r\ncircumstances, they turned their back upon it.\r\n\r\nThey were both decent, intelligent men, and, had they remained, taken\r\nland, gone to work, opened a farm, and seen their first crop ripening,\r\nyou could no more have got them back to Philadelphia than you could get\r\nthem into the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nNow, we say to those for whose benefit this pamphlet has been written,\r\nif you come here you must come fully prepared to feel the effects of a\r\ngreat change. If you come from a city, you will, doubtless, feel lonely\r\nfor a while, until you get accustomed to prairie life; you will miss\r\nmany immediate comforts; you will have to put up with discomforts, with\r\ndisappointments, with trials. The man who feels he can stand up against\r\nall such difficulties in the present, and look bravely to the future for\r\nhis reward, let him come to Minnesota. The man who feels within him no\r\nsuch strength, who is easily disheartened and inclined to listen to the\r\nidle talk of every man whom he meets, let him stop away and listen;\r\nbetter to listen now, where you are, than after going to the expense of\r\ncoming here.\r\n\r\nTo the family man we say: We would much prefer that you should come on\r\nhere in the spring and see for yourself before breaking up your present\r\nhome and bringing on your family.\r\n\r\nIf you settle down, you can send or go for your family; if you are not\r\npleased with the change, there will not be much harm done.\r\n\r\nAnother very important piece of advice we give to you: If your wife is\r\nvery much opposed to going upon land, do not come out. A discontented\r\nwife on a new farm is far worse than the Colorado beetle. But if she\r\nurges you to come, if, in this matter, she thinks of your welfare and\r\nthat of her children, rather than of the society of the gossips she will\r\nleave behind her; if she says to you, \"we will have the children out of\r\nharm's way anyhow,\" then come with a brave heart and the smile of the\r\ntrue wife and mother shall be as a sunbeam in your prairie home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO SECURE GOVERNMENT LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot promise government land in any of our colonies, still\r\nwe give the following synopsis of the laws affecting such land, as\r\nlikely to be of benefit to those who wish to secure homes in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMESTEADS.\r\n\r\n1. _Who may enter._--First, every head of a family; second, every single\r\nperson, male or female, over the age of twenty-one years, who are\r\ncitizens of the United States, or have declared their intentions to\r\nbecome such.\r\n\r\n2. _Quantity that may be entered._--80 acres within ten miles on each\r\nside of a land-grant railroad, and 160 acres without.\r\n\r\n3. _Cost of entry._--Fourteen dollars.\r\n\r\n4. _Time for settlement._--After making his entry the settler has six\r\nmonths within which to remove upon his land.\r\n\r\n5. _Length of settlement._--The settler must live upon and cultivate his\r\nentry for five years. At any time after five, and within seven years, he\r\nmakes proof of residence and cultivation.\r\n\r\n6. _Proof required._--His own affidavit and the testimony of two\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\n7. _Residence._--Single, as well as married men, are required to live\r\nupon their homesteads.\r\n\r\n8. _Soldiers' Homesteads._--Every honorable discharged soldier, sailor\r\nor marine, who served for ninety days, can enter 160 acres within\r\nrailroad limits, upon payment of eighteen dollars. The time spent in the\r\nservice will be deducted from the five years' residence required.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMBER CULTURE ENTRY.\r\n\r\n1. _Who may enter._--The same qualifications are required as in a\r\nhomestead entry.\r\n\r\n2. _Quantity that may be entered._--40, 80, or 160 acres.\r\n\r\n3. _Limitations._--But one-fourth of any section can be entered.\r\n\r\n4. _Requirements._--No settlement is required. By the amended law only\r\nten acres need be broken and set out in trees on 160 acres, (quarter\r\nsection.)\r\n\r\nFirst year, break five acres.\r\n\r\nSecond year, break five acres and cultivate in crop first year's\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\nThird year, set out trees in first five acres broken and crop second\r\nfive acres.\r\n\r\nFourth year, set out trees in latest five acres broken.\r\n\r\nN. B.--Seed or cuttings can be put in in place of trees.\r\n\r\nIf the timber entry be but 80 acres, one-half the quantity before given\r\nis planted; if 40 acres, one-fourth.\r\n\r\n5. _Proof required._--Affidavit of party, and testimony of two\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\n6. _Cost of entry._--Fourteen dollars for any entry, without regard to\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nA man making a Homestead entry, is also entitled to make a\r\nTimber-culture entry. This would give him, outside of the ten miles\r\nrailroad grant, half a section of land; a son or daughter, twenty-one\r\nyears of age, can also enter under the Homestead and Timber-claim acts,\r\nhalf a section; and thus one family can secure a whole section of land.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRE-EMPTION ACT.\r\n\r\nUnder this act, a man can enter 80 acres of government land, inside the\r\nten miles railroad limits, price $2.50 per acre; or 160 acres, outside\r\nthe railroad grant, for which he will have to pay, getting two years\r\ntime $1.25, government price.\r\n\r\nIf he wishes, he can pay up in six months, on proof of actual residence,\r\nhaving made the improvements on the land required by the law, which are\r\neasily done, and get his title; having secured this, he can then enter\r\n80 or 160 acres more, under the Homestead act. He cannot Pre-empt and\r\nHomestead at the same time.\r\n\r\nNone of the government conditions for securing land are at all\r\nburdensome to the actual settler; whether required by law or not, to be\r\na farmer, a man must live upon his land and cultivate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ADVERTISEMENT.]\r\n\r\nTHE VERY BEST LINE\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nST.

PAUL, MINNESOTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ADVERTISEMENT.]\r\n\r\nGAMMON & DEERING, HARVESTING MACHINERY.\r\n\r\nThe Marsh Harvester and Harvester King, with or without their celebrated\r\nAutomatic Crane Binder Attachment for 1879.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe present, on this page, a cut representing the latest improvements in\r\ngrain-cutting machinery, as shown in the celebrated _Marsh Harvester\r\nwith Automatic Crane-Binder Attachment_.\r\n\r\nThe Marsh Harvester itself is too widely and favorably known to require\r\nan extended description or commendation. It was the first of this class\r\nof grain-harvesting machines, and, indeed, for some years the only one,\r\nforcing itself into favor against the united opposition of the various\r\nreaper manufacturers who are now so clamorous in praise of their\r\nimitation harvesters. It also made practicable automatic grain binding.\r\nAll attempts to put self-binding attachments to other reapers proved\r\nfutile, and have only been successful when attached to harvesters\r\ncutting and elevating the grain, as is done by this harvester.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers of the Marsh Harvester have been fully alive to the\r\nimportance of having a self-binding attachment to their harvesters that\r\nshould be correspondingly for a binder what their harvester is admitted\r\nto be--_the best of its class_. To this end they have had skilled labor\r\nspecially employed for several years, and have invented and patented\r\nseveral important improvements and devices, and have bought others. They\r\nhave also had their binders in the grain fields for several years past,\r\nfollowing the progress of the harvest from Texas to Manitoba. Last\r\nseason this binder did remarkable work. Such minor defects as the most\r\nthorough tests and roughest usage developed have been carefully\r\nremedied.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer a question of success with this binder, success is a\r\nfully demonstrated fact. Another thing will be obvious to all who\r\ncarefully examine this binder, that it is very simple and easily\r\nunderstood. This is an indispensible requisite to a successful machine.\r\n\r\nFarmers are too busy and too much hurried in harvest time to study\r\nmechanics or tinker on machinery. They want a machine they can put in\r\nthe field, and do good work, without bother, loss of time or undue\r\nperplexity. This harvester and binder will do good work with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe Marsh Harvester cuts a five-foot swath the King cuts six feet. All\r\nof these harvesters are so made this year that a binder attachment can\r\nbe put on at any time hereafter, so that a farmer, desiring to divide\r\nthe expense, can buy the harvester this year and the binder next.\r\n\r\nLook at it! A few years ago it required six or seven men to do, with a\r\nself-rake reaper, what the Marsh Harvester and Binder will do with one\r\nman or one boy. The Harvester also does the work cleaner and better. It\r\nbinds every straw, and saves enough in this way to nearly or quite pay\r\nfor the wire. The wire-bound bundles can be made as large or as small as\r\nyou like. The wire is unobjectionable in threshing, the wire passing\r\nthrough without injury to the thresher. No cattle will eat wire, and no\r\none has ever been known to be injured by it. It requires about three\r\npounds of wire to an acre of grain of average stand. This machine\r\nreduces the cost and the labor of grain harvesting to a minimum. No\r\nprogressive farmer can afford to do his work with an old-fashioned\r\nreaper. He might almost as well return to the hand sickle.\r\n\r\nIt is now a question of the best binder. _Thus far the manufacturers of\r\nthe Marsh Harvester have furnished the best harvester, and now they\r\noffer the best binder_, and still propose to keep their machines in the\r\nlead, as they have been, and are now.\r\n\r\nWe also manufacture the old and reliable WARRIOR MOWER, admitted by all\r\nto be one of the best mowers in use. Apply to the nearest agency or to\r\nGammon & Deering, Chicago, Ill., for circulars containing full\r\nparticulars in regard to those machines.\r\n\r\n  =_W. H.
