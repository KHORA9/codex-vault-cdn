WILDER\r\n  FOR MANY YEARS GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT SWIFT & CO.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  PUBLISHERS\r\n  NICKERSON & COLLINS CO.\r\n  CHICAGO\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1905 AND 1921,\r\n  BY NICKERSON & COLLINS CO., CHICAGO\r\n\r\n  All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\n  Press of\r\n  ICE AND REFRIGERATION\r\n  Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the revised edition of this work, the first\r\ncomplete treatise upon the subject of the meat packing house business\r\npublished, the original scheme has been followed. First, presenting\r\nin a convenient and simple form, practical suggestions, tables and\r\nformula that are needed in the operation of the packing house business\r\naccording to modern practice. Second, describing operations in the\r\nvarious ramifications of the business, from the unloading of the\r\nanimals at the pens to the production of the finished product and the\r\ndisposition of it, in the order in which the different operations are\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\nThe various operations described and subjects treated upon have been\r\nindexed so that any matter upon which it is desired to obtain instant\r\ninformation may be readily found. The author arranged the chapters in\r\nthe order of the various operations in the packing house, together with\r\ndescriptions of the machinery and appliances required. The established\r\npacker, as well as the beginner, if he carefully digest the contents\r\nof this work, will find he has valuable information, the knowledge of\r\nwhich will aid him in conducting his business.\r\n\r\nThe chapters on proper construction and arrangement contain information\r\nin which the author has given the reader the benefit of his experience\r\nin the construction and operation of packing plants.\r\n\r\nA portion of the contents of this work is devoted to tests showing the\r\nvalue and yields of the various products of a modern packing house,\r\nbased on prices and conditions existing at the time they were made, in\r\nwhich the percentages and comparisons are reliable and are available\r\nto the reader by using the weights and percentage shown, computed on\r\npresent commercial prices.\r\n\r\nThe numerous formulas given for the manufacture and preservation of the\r\nvarious products of the packing house are those which have been proven\r\nto be the best after years of experience. In every instance they have\r\nbeen put in the simplest form possible, so that no mistake can be made\r\nin applying them.\r\n\r\nIn revising this work, it is recognized that the use of some of the\r\ningredients are now prohibited by regulation in the United States, but\r\nin some instances, it has been seen fit to not change the original\r\nformulas. In some instances, however, the omission of the objectionable\r\ningredient has been made, though otherwise the formula remains the same\r\nas in the first edition. Many formulas rendered obsolete are omitted on\r\naccount of conflicting with pure food laws.\r\n\r\nThe information furnished in these pages is based upon the author’s\r\nexperience, there being very little theorizing upon the possibilities\r\nof what may be accomplished by adopting certain prescribed methods.\r\nFor this reason, the book will be found of practical value to those\r\ninterested in the meat packing business.\r\n\r\nThe present necessity of a work on packing house operation is more\r\nevident than when the first edition was published. The original work\r\nhas been entirely revised where considered necessary, amplified in\r\nplaces and much new information added.\r\n\r\nThe chapters relative to construction, refrigeration and mechanical\r\noperation have been revised to conform to advanced practice.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment is made of the use of engravings, photographs and\r\noriginal data, and ideas developed and used by the reviser in his\r\nengineering practice. That the volume will be well received and fill\r\nthe needs as a hand book and reference work is the hope of the authors\r\nand publishers.\r\n\r\nThe assimilation of the contents as a foundation, together with power\r\nof observation and application will greatly assist beginners in\r\npacking house work, the methods of which are progressing--although the\r\nfundamentals remain the same.\r\n\r\nThe reviser hopes assistance will be given in this way, which he in\r\nturn received by oral advice from the two outstanding superintendents\r\nin their day (the days of the business growth), Messrs. F. W. Wilder\r\nand C. O. Young.\r\n\r\n  D. I.

The modern\r\npacking house, as it exists today, may be said to be less than forty\r\nyears old since its inception. One naturally inquires the causes\r\nwhich led to the growth of this industry to its present proportions\r\nin so short a time, ranking practically fifth in importance among\r\nthe industries of the United States. The main factor which has\r\nbeen instrumental in the consummation of this immense growth is\r\n_concentration_--coupled with--_conservation_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Concentration.=--Concentration permits the manipulation of\r\nby-products, creating useful and valuable materials saleable in\r\nthemselves and tending to reduce the commercial cost of the edible\r\nportion of the animal. Conservation in the saving of all parts of the\r\nanimal to their best uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Methods.=--Before the modern packing house was established the\r\nmethod in vogue was to either ship by car or drive live stock to the\r\npoint of consumption, where it was slaughtered and put on the market\r\nin a crude and expensive way compared with the methods of to-day. In\r\nthe evolution of the business the first step toward making the modern\r\npacking house was the concentration of live stock at a few markets\r\nwhere it was offered for sale. Prior to that time it would have been\r\nimpossible for any one point to obtain sufficient stock to much more\r\nthan supply its local demands, and surely not enough to supply a modern\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yankee Ingenuity.=--In the United States during the early days of\r\nthe live stock market, buyers purchased their supplies where they\r\nbest could, and shipped them alive to the places where the animals\r\nwere to be consumed. At this point “Yankee” ingenuity interceded and\r\ndevised the opposite plan, viz: that of shipping the live stock to\r\na few central points and there changing it to dressed meats, which\r\nwere shipped to the consuming markets. The development of this plan\r\ninaugurated a new line of business now recognized as one of the most\r\nimportant of modern industries--central stock yards and packing house\r\ncenters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--LIVE STOCK GOING TO SCALE, UNION STOCK YARDS,\r\nCHICAGO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chicago Yards.=--One of the first and largest of these central live\r\nstock depots to be established was the Union Stock Yards, Chicago,\r\nIll., U. S. A., where are located the largest slaughter houses. Views\r\nof these great yards are shown. Fig. 1 shows one of the places where\r\nlive stock is passed to the scales and weighed prior to delivery to the\r\npurchaser; Fig. 2, a view of the live stock pens and an alleyway on a\r\nbusy day; Fig. 3, a view of a pen containing choice yearling cattle,\r\nand Fig. 4, one containing a bunch of choice Polled-Angus cattle. These\r\nviews are typical of many markets now established throughout the United\r\nStates and where the business is conducted upon a parallel basis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--A BUSY ALLEY, UNION STOCK YARDS, CHICAGO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Movement Westward.=--Many factors and conditions contributed to the\r\npossibility of the modern packing plant. The feature of slaughtering\r\nthe cattle near to the point of growth lessened the shrinkage and\r\nabuse of the animal and its resulting food product. There are many of\r\nthe conditions that might be gone into in detail but which are now of\r\nno consequence. However, among the conditions that made the business\r\npossible was the fact that on the vast plains of the west, innumerable\r\ncattle were being raised at a minimum cost, with but little local\r\nsale, whereas in the thickly settled east, in the manufacturing\r\ndistricts, a ready market was found for the beef.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--PEN CONTAINING CHOICE YEARLING CATTLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Economic Factors.=--Economic conditions make the raising of live\r\nstock, in juxtaposition to the production of grain, a fixed fact. And\r\napparently the nearer to the source of supply the animal is slaughtered\r\nthe less deterioration in the product, animal and meat considered\r\ntogether. The packing business of this country would practically be\r\nimpossible in older countries that are thickly settled, as the cost\r\nof raising live stock would be actually about the same in all parts,\r\nand the cost of shipping from one point to another would only add to\r\nthe original cost. With the lower cost of raising the animal on low\r\nvalue land, the eastern farmer with his high priced land was unable\r\nto compete, hence the practice of raising live stock in the west and\r\nconsuming it in the east; and the concentration of live stock at the\r\nlarge markets, with the improved devices, has made the business a\r\npossibility, and the money and energy expended in adopting the best\r\nmethods has caused its growth to its present magnitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--PEN CONTAINING CHOICE POLLED-ANGUS CATTLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Saving By-Products.=--Another important feature adding to the growth\r\nof this industry, is the saving effected by utilizing the by-products.\r\nWhen animals were killed promiscuously throughout the country this\r\nwas impossible, for a man killing a few at some local point could not\r\nsave the by-products, consequently they were lost. Neither could the\r\nsmall killer afford the necessary appliances with which to turn the\r\nmaterial out economically and compete with business on a large scale,\r\nany more than the ancient cobbler sitting at his bench, could afford\r\nthe labor-saving machines and devices which are seen in modern shoe\r\nfactories. The general health of the public has been served by having\r\ntheir meats properly inspected and delivered in a much better condition\r\nthan they could be at the time when the animal was killed and the meat\r\nconsumed without it being properly chilled. That the meat is delivered\r\nto the consumer in a more palatable condition than it was formerly\r\nis generally conceded by all. Foreigners who visit this country are\r\ninvariably impressed with the superior meats with which they are\r\nserved, due to the process in chilling, and the age at the time of\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThe by-products which are saved in modern plants, which, under the\r\nolder methods were almost entirely lost, have a good value. Heads and\r\nfeet, for example, which were ordinarily thrown away, are to-day made\r\nup into various products, all of which have a value. The blood, fats\r\nand refuse, are turned into commercial commodities, and the saving\r\nof these different parts creates a profit in the business, a profit\r\nheretofore lost. Further details on this subject will be given in the\r\nchapters treating on by-products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pioneer’s Troubles.=--When the pioneers of the business first broached\r\nthe idea of killing cattle in Chicago and selling the dressed beef in\r\nthe east it was considered wholly impracticable, and the people who\r\nstarted the business were looked upon as a “little queer.” There were\r\nmany bitter experiences, in the way of financial losses before it\r\nwas accomplished. Shipping perishable products long distances caused\r\nthe loss of many thousands of dollars before the proper methods were\r\ndiscovered, but the beginners felt they were working along the right\r\nlines. Obstacles were overcome and to-day meats are delivered in\r\neastern markets in a far better and a more healthful condition than\r\nthey were ever offered to the public under the old methods from local\r\nabattoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Using Box Cars.=--In the early days of the concentrated cattle\r\nmarkets, fresh meat products were only shipped during the winter months\r\nand in a common or what is now known as a “box” car, as differentiated\r\nfrom a “refrigerator” car.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Using Refrigerator Cars.=--The next step was the use of ice in the\r\ncar and from this to the “refrigerator” car. This type of car with the\r\nimproved dispatch service offered by the railways, made the business of\r\nshipping freshly dressed beef to any part of the country feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Chilling Room.=--Notably and most essential was the development of\r\na chilling department in which the slaughtered animal could be properly\r\nchilled. This is now a matter of such common occurrence that but little\r\nconsideration is given the subject. However, in the days when ice was\r\nused, and before the introduction of mechanical refrigeration it was a\r\nmatter of large consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mechanical Refrigeration.=--Mechanical refrigeration, and this alone,\r\nhas made it possible to properly cool meats for shipment to remote\r\npoints as fresh meats, or to properly prepare them for curing, and\r\nto preserve them after curing beyond a comparatively limited time.\r\nMechanical refrigeration made possible the equipping of ships for the\r\ntransportation of meats under refrigeration from any point to any\r\nmarket on the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Freezing Meats.=--The freezing of meats such as beef and poultry, and\r\nholding them to a desirable season has rapidly become an important\r\nfactor in packing house work. Not only beef, poultry, butter and other\r\nfood products are accumulated, but pork cuts, such as hams, shoulders,\r\nbellies, etc., are frozen and carried indefinitely or until it appears\r\ndesirable to thaw and cure them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Overseas Shipments.=--A contributing feature to the development of\r\nthe packing house business, was the overseas shipment of meats. In the\r\nearly part of the decade 1900-1910 a very large business in fresh beef\r\nwas conducted between the United States and England. At the outset it\r\nwas considered an impossibility, but by the most careful and detailed\r\nattention and the utilization of modern methods, it was found possible\r\nto kill cattle or sheep in the hottest months of the year at interior\r\npoints in the United States, ship the meats in refrigerator cars to\r\nthe seaboard, transfer into refrigerated rooms on the steamers and\r\nthence to England, the meat being sometimes four or five weeks en\r\nroute from the abattoir where the animal was killed, to the place\r\nwhere the meat finally reached the consumer. Even though the English\r\nauthorities gave it the most critical examination, it was found in\r\nproper state for consumption. In the same manner vast quantities of\r\nmeat is finding its way from South America to the European markets,\r\nmost of it shipped “chilled,” not frozen. For a time the United States\r\nfurnished the largest part of the fresh meat consumed in England. It is\r\ntrue that for many years we have supplied foreign markets with cured\r\nand canned meats, but the fresh meat trade in England is a business\r\ndeveloped within a comparatively few years and it grew to magnitude.\r\nHowever, owing to our growth, increasing home demands, and the changed\r\neconomic conditions, this business dwindled in the last decade so that\r\non beef it was practically gone, except that during the European war\r\nowing to prevailing conditions, it was revived for a time at least. The\r\npre-eminence of the United States pork products, however, is everywhere\r\nrecognized and until new corn producing lands are developed and\r\nutilized, the corn and the pig supply for the world will be that part\r\nof the United States west of the Alleghany mountains and east of the\r\nRocky mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLOCATION AND CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LOCATION -- WATER SUPPLY -- SEWAGE -- ODORS AND PREVAILING WINDS\r\n  -- CLEANLINESS -- DESIGNS AND ERRORS -- CHARACTER OF BUSINESS --\r\n  REQUIREMENTS -- PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Location.=--Location is a moderate sized word with a vast meaning. It\r\nhas two definitions as applied to meat packing houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_First._--Location as to a live stock supply. Pioneers in foreign lands\r\nlooking for a cheap supply must take into consideration the quantity\r\nimmediately available, the probabilities based upon feeding, climate,\r\nnatural enemies--beast and bug--and the ambition of the people to\r\nproduce as well as their ability to produce.\r\n\r\nSometimes an apparent supply is at hand but a searching investigation\r\nwill show that it is an accumulated surplus, soon exhausted, with a\r\nresultant dearth. In the case of cattle, a supply cannot be created in\r\na day but by persistent effort and in several generations of human life.\r\n\r\nTransportation by trooping and by train, or the ability of the cattle\r\nto withstand the first or the ability of the railways to handle for\r\nwant of facilities, are at times matters of much consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Second._--Location as applied to a position for operating,\r\napplicable to domestic or foreign works. There are several items of\r\nprime importance to be considered in selecting a location from this\r\nstandpoint. In many instances a plant is established near a locality\r\nproducing a sufficient quality of live stock suitable for a certain\r\npurpose, for example pigs suitable for export trade. In some instances\r\nthe selection of a location is made for trade reasons, or to be\r\nadjacent to a stock yards; and in instances because property is owned\r\nin a certain locality. Where situation can be of choice, the matters\r\nfor most serious consideration are sewage disposal, water supply,\r\nprevailing winds and transportation facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water Supply.=--This is of great consequence. The quantity to be\r\nused for condensing purposes, refrigerating machinery operation,\r\nfor cleansing, and in the regular course of business, is a very\r\nlarge amount, and if purchased from water supply corporations or\r\nmunicipalities, at prevailing rates, become a burdensome item of\r\nexpense. The principal use for water can be classified under three\r\nheadings:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boiler Purposes_--This naturally will be selected from available\r\nsources based upon fitness, irrespective of cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Condensing_--First, for refrigerating machinery ammonia condensing\r\nand for steam engine condensing, in conjunction with the production\r\nof power and operating steam engines on refrigerating equipment.\r\nFor this purpose cold water is desirable. If it can be obtained\r\nfrom wells it is the best practice, owing to such water usually\r\nbeing of low temperature. However, the cost of production must be\r\nconsidered, and that calls for engineering knowledge as to relative\r\nconditions. Usually, unless the surface water be in large quantity\r\nand available from a stream, the wells prove economical unless the\r\nwater must be raised from great depths involving air lift pumping.\r\nThere are instances, however, where turbidity makes water from streams\r\nundesirable and where well water is unobtainable, and in instances of\r\nthis kind use of settling basins, reservoirs and cooling towers is\r\nresorted to.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For Cleaning and Other Purposes_--The water for cleansing purposes,\r\nfor food products, fats and premises, should be clean and free from\r\ncontamination that render it unfit for potable uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sewage.=--The question of sewage disposal from a packing house is of\r\nmore consequence than the water supply, which is usually determined by\r\nthe relative cost. The former is a matter of disposition. No matter\r\nhow carefully the refuse from the slaughtered animal is collected for\r\npassing through the rendering department, or how carefully the waters\r\nfrom cooking are collected for evaporation, quite large quantities\r\nof nitrogenous particles and many substances which are more cheaply\r\ndisposed of by the way of the sewers, ultimately reach them. If the\r\nrefuse finds its way to a rapidly flowing stream, it is taken care of\r\nby bacterial action, but if discharged into a dry stream or pool, or\r\nto a sewage disposal plant, it becomes a serious burden that sooner or\r\nlater reverts to the packer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Odors and Prevailing Winds.=--Naturally to minimize the distance of\r\ntransport to stations for shipping or delivery to the consumer, or\r\nto be near to a supply of labor, every manufacturer is desirous of\r\nlocating his works near to a city or on its outskirts, if not at a\r\ncommercial stock yards. Where the latter are of comparatively large\r\nconsequence to a community, the odors arising are usually considered a\r\n“necessary evil” and the packing plant as a part of that.\r\n\r\nNo matter how carefully the plant may be operated, if the full\r\ncommercial value is taken out of all products there are some\r\ndepartments in which it is difficult to abate the smells, and if the\r\nprevailing winds are towards a residence district, it is likely to\r\ncause disturbance. This statement can be qualified, however, because it\r\nis a fact that plants can be designed and can be operated so as to be\r\nkept within proper bounds and be of no more nuisance than the handling\r\nof the live animals, but it will always be well for the prospective\r\npacker to recognize that he would not care to live on the premises,\r\nnor will his neighbor appreciate his works any more than he. A packing\r\nhouse properly belongs to a district at a reasonable distance from\r\nresidence property, and where the prevailing winds are not toward the\r\nresidence district.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cleanliness.=--The features contributing most to the operation of\r\na plant so as to avoid it becoming noisome is that of cleanliness,\r\nfirst, last and always; ample equipment to promptly dispose of all\r\nby-products, and to do it promptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Design and Errors.=--The location disposed of, the design and\r\nconstruction is a problem that cannot have too careful consideration.\r\nThere are two grievous errors that may creep in; overbuilding and under\r\nbuilding. Overbuilding recognizes the construction of a plant too large\r\nfor present needs, thereby making the capital investment too large\r\nfor the business to be done, and sometimes resulting in the handicap\r\nof insufficient monies for plant operation with all the difficulties\r\nentailed. Under building, failing to recognize the growth that might\r\noccur and failing to so arrange that the growth can be made in a way\r\nthat keeps the plant in balance and makes for economical operation.\r\nEither condition may lead to regrets.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Character of Business.=--At this point comes the consideration of the\r\ncharacter of the business to be conducted and the proportioning of\r\ndepartments one to another suitably. For instance, in a beef shipping\r\nplant for fresh beef the coolers may have a hanging capacity equal to\r\nat least three times the daily slaughtering capacity, while at some\r\nmarket points the ratio may be ten times. Whereas, at a freezing plant\r\nit becomes a question of room to accumulate a cargo dependent upon\r\ntransport facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Requirements.=--The requirements in the various localities, as to\r\narrangement of departments; to comply with sanitary necessities as\r\nto light and ventilation, and the classes of materials required in\r\nconstruction, are changing from time to time and no set rule can be\r\nmade, but these are axiomatic:\r\n\r\n(1) Products prepared for food purposes must be quickly and thoroughly\r\nisolated from non-edible products.\r\n\r\n(2) All departments should, so far as possible, be maintained in\r\nseparate buildings.\r\n\r\n(3) Building materials should, so far as possible, be non-absorbent.\r\n\r\n(4) Light and air should be arranged for in plenty.\r\n\r\n(5) The question of movement of product to minimize labor should be\r\ngiven proper attention. In the building of a packing house it is only\r\nwithin the last few years that this matter has been studied from the\r\nstandpoint of obtaining the best results at the least expenditure for\r\noperating.\r\n\r\n(6) Formerly it was considered proper to build the killing house and\r\ncoolers on the ground level, excavating a cellar for the storage of\r\nsome of the products; the power house, tank rooms and other buildings\r\nfor the disposition of by-products were placed without reference to\r\neconomy in operation. Experience has proven that it is economical to\r\nslaughter animals on the upper floor of a building, and instead of\r\nspreading out on the ground and covering a large area as formerly, to\r\nbuild higher over a smaller area. With a proper incline the animals\r\nwill walk to an elevation of 50 or 60 feet without detriment to their\r\ncondition, and it is much cheaper to do this than to kill them on the\r\nground level and elevate the products, or to convey or transport them\r\nto distant buildings on the same level.\r\n\r\n(7) The use of gravity is recognized as a proper procedure in all\r\ndepartments from a low labor cost standpoint. The locating of the\r\nbuildings, one to another; to minimize the transferring of products;\r\nand the grouping of products as to convenience in shipping by wagon, by\r\ncar or by boat, as the case may require, are also important.\r\n\r\n(8) Very important is the question of grouping cold storage departments\r\nso as to minimize the wall space and exposure from radiation; likewise\r\nthe concentration of buildings requiring heat to avoid the loss of fuel\r\nby reason of long steam lines, and radiation which can not be prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Principles of Design.=--The crux of the plant appears to be the\r\nslaughtering department for it is here the work begins and from this\r\nsource radiates the various parts for disposal. One well-known and\r\nsuccessful designer works with the idea of beginning at the rendering\r\ndepartment, and establishing the tops of the rendering tanks, or\r\ndigestors, on a level with the viscera separating floor, from which\r\nthe refuse is readily transported without the use of elevator or lift\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe slaughtering floor is naturally above this level, and all other\r\ndepartments disposed to meet the various needs. Obviously there being\r\nso many controlling factors, no examples can be set out to meet all\r\nconditions. There follows however, a ground plan and sectional view of\r\nseveral plants of varying sizes with descriptive data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPLANT DESIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DESCRIPTION OF PLANTS -- PLANT NO. 1 -- PLANT NO. 2 -- PLANT NO. 3\r\n  -- PLANT NO. 4 -- TYPE OF PLANT -- LOADING FACILITIES -- PRODUCING\r\n  DEPARTMENT -- ABBATOIR BUILDING -- RENDERING BUILDING -- LIVE STOCK\r\n  -- ICING DEPARTMENT -- COOLER BUILDING -- PORK HOUSE -- MANUFACTURING\r\n  BUILDING -- SALT SPACES -- POWER DEPARTMENT -- GRAVITY SYSTEM --\r\n  HOW TO BUILD -- FIREPROOF DESIGN -- ADVANTAGES -- SLOW BURNING\r\n  CONSTRUCTION -- APPROVAL OF PLANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Description of Plants.=--This chapter is devoted to a description of\r\nseveral types of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plant No. 1.=--A moderate sized beef, mutton, and pork producing plant\r\ncapable of slaughtering six hundred cattle, fifteen hundred sheep\r\nand fifteen hundred hogs daily, and taking care of the products of\r\nmanufacture resulting therefrom. This design was developed upon the\r\nprinciple of gravity for movement of products with as little use of\r\nelevators as possible; the avoidance of excessive use of mechanical\r\nconveyors and contrivances; the grouping of buildings intended for\r\nhot or cold temperatures; economy of operation, and for minimum car\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loading Facilities._--The general arrangement provides for wagon and\r\ndray loading facilities fronting the main thoroughfare. The garage and\r\noffice are at the left and right sides of the court. Three tracks are\r\nsituated between the two groups of buildings to take care of the car\r\nloading. Usually the refrigerated products are loaded upon the east\r\ntrack, and non-refrigerated products, such as hides and bones, and the\r\noleo department products, upon the west track. The intermediate track\r\nis used for the storing of cars. By use of the connecting platform\r\nat the south end either kind of cars can be loaded on either track. A\r\nseparate non-interfering railroad spur is provided for unloading coal,\r\nand cotton seed oil, and for loading tallow, while a distinct track is\r\nprovided for loading cars of dry salt meats from the pork warehouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--PLANT NO. 1, MODERATE SIZE PACKING HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Producing Department_--The abattoir is made the center of\r\ndistribution, with the refrigerated buildings and departments directly\r\ncommunicative, situated nearby. The rendering and manufacturing\r\ndepartments--users of steam and power--are grouped near to the abattoir\r\nand to the power plant, while the buildings requiring refrigeration\r\nare grouped together and isolated from the manufacturing buildings.\r\nThe stock pens connected with the plant are to the left of the\r\nmanufacturing groups, but are not shown on the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abattoir Building_--This building, six stories high, is given over to\r\nthe following uses: Fourth floor, slaughtering; third floor, treatment,\r\nseparation and cooking of by-products and manufacture of casings;\r\nsecond floor, oleo oil manufacturing; first floor, oleo oil storage,\r\nand shipping purposes; basement and sub-basement, storage of tallow and\r\ncuring of hides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--EXTERIOR VIEW BEEF, SHEEP AND PORK PLANT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rendering Building_--Divided into two sections and separated by\r\npartitions, one side is used for the refining of cotton seed oil and\r\nthe manufacture of edible tallows; the other side for cooking blood\r\nand rendering inedible tallows. The floors are used as follows:\r\nSecond floor, level with viscera separating floor in abattoir, from\r\nwhence raw stock is trucked to the filling floor without requiring\r\nuse of elevators for filling of tanks; first floor, tank bodies and\r\nreceptacles for collection of tallow. The skimming vats to which the\r\ntank residue, after drawing off the tallows, is passed, are level with\r\nthis floor, enabling the separation and floating of the tallow and\r\nits collection; basement for press room, and sub-basement for drying\r\ntankage. The tank water to be evaporated is collected and passed to a\r\nseparate building for treatment and evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Live Stock_--The live stock pens are situated to the left of the\r\nrendering department extending north of the oil storage tanks from\r\nwhich position leads an incline, delivering the live stock into an\r\nelevated storage pen covering the area between the rendering house and\r\nthe abattoir, and over the dressing room.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Icing Department_--Facilities for manufacturing ice for cooling cars\r\nare provided in the space directly north of the abattoir building. The\r\nthree railroad tracks between the two groups of buildings are covered\r\nwith a protecting shed, and from the bottom member of the trusses are\r\nsuspended trolley rails for handling buckets of ice to be dumped into\r\nthe tanks of the refrigerator cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cooler Building_--The dressed beef, mutton and pork is transferred\r\nvia bridge with chain conveyors, carrying the carcasses from the\r\nslaughtering house floor to the cooling rooms situated upon the third\r\nfloor of the cooler building. From this floor the carcasses are\r\nconveyed for storage purposes to the second and first floor, and from\r\nthere they are passed to the cutting room, city sales department, or\r\ncars. The basement and sub-basement are used for curing beef and pork\r\njoints. The fourth floor of this building is set aside for freezing\r\nproducts which, after being frozen, are shipped for storage to other\r\npremises owned by the same company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--SECTIONAL VIEW INDICATING LEVELS AND\r\nCOMPARATIVE LEVELS OF DEPARTMENT FLOORS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pork House_--The fourth floor of the pork house is utilized for\r\nchilling hogs; the third for cutting them, and all floors below for\r\ncuring purposes. Note, the arrangement whereby the pork house and the\r\ncooler building are each connected with the team-loading platform and\r\nalso closely arranged for car loading.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manufacturing Building_--A manufacturing building given over to the\r\nproduction of sausage, smoked meats, lard and the packing and shipping\r\nof same is immediately north of the cooler and pork buildings, and\r\nconnected thereto at all floors where necessary. The city shipping\r\ndepartment has its allotted space on the ground floor of the cooler\r\nbuilding and the products finished in the manufacturing building move\r\nsouth toward the team loading platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt Spaces, etc._--In this instance, but which rarely occurs, the\r\ncity’s main sewer system is located at a deep level, which affords\r\nproper drainage and permitted the construction of two cellars. There\r\nare, therefore, two stories practically under ground. This is a decided\r\nadvantage from the standpoint of radiation exposure, and it also\r\naffords an opportunity to provide salt storage and cooperage stowing\r\nspaces on two levels adjacent to the railroad tracks. It further\r\nprovides a means for securing a connecting tunnel below the track\r\nlevel, thus providing facilities for a perfect interchange from all\r\ncellar departments. Of equal consequence is the opportunity to pass all\r\npipes for water, steam and refrigeration, power and lighting wires, as\r\nwell as products, from one department to another. This makes for a low\r\nupkeep cost, little exposure, less radiation and greatly reduces the\r\nannual upkeep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Power Department_--The boilers were placed on a floor level with the\r\nbasement. The coal pocket into which coal is dropped extends to the\r\nsub-basement level, providing a comparatively large coal storage. At\r\nthe sub-basement level are the ash collecting bins. From this level are\r\nprovided elevators of the continuous bucket type for raising the coal\r\nand ashes to tanks provided for storage, from which the coal and ashes\r\ngravitate to the furnaces and disposal cars respectively.\r\n\r\nThe engine foundations extend to the sub-basement level, with the main\r\nengine situated upon the basement level. The pumps are located in part\r\non the lower level. All pipes and wires leading to the operating\r\ndepartment are carried through the sub-basement, permitting the\r\narrangement of all exhaust and steam piping beneath the engine room\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gravity System_--Attention is called to the fact that in the rendering\r\ndepartment, for example, the products in their steps of manufacture\r\nare handled by gravity entirely until the finished dried fertilizer\r\nis produced, which has to be elevated to the ground level for car\r\nshipment, or for wagon delivery. The same features are true of the\r\nabattoir, hides and tallow in casks only, requiring the use of\r\nelevators for shipment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--PLANT NO. 2, GROUND PLAN FOR COUNTRY PACKING\r\nHOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plant No. 2.=--This plant was designed for a country point where the\r\nshipping by local freight cars or the city delivery was quite limited;\r\nwhere the major part of the product would be shipped by car, and\r\nwhere provision was made for quite an extensive growth. The capacity\r\nas designed being four hundred hogs and fifty cattle daily, with a\r\ncomplementary quantity of calves and sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loading Facilities_--Again the three railways are provided for\r\nconvenience in loading and for facilitating switching and icing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--PLANT NO. 2, SECTION THROUGH SLAUGHTERING AND\r\nRENDERING BUILDING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--PLANT NO. 2, SECTION THROUGH MANUFACTURING\r\nBUILDING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--PLANT NO. 2, SECTION THROUGH COOLER BUILDING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Producing Department_--In this plant the slaughter of hogs is the\r\npredominant business. The hog killing department was consequently\r\ndesigned amply large and for a growth to upwards of fifteen hundred\r\nhogs daily, while the rendering department provides for additional\r\ntanking facilities to be added as required. In this building, near to\r\nthe source of production is placed a small air blast type of meat and\r\nleaf lard cooling space.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rendering Department_--Owing to abattoir being isolated it was\r\npossible to set aside a portion of the building for the rendering\r\ndepartment, and make the construction comply with the sanitary\r\nrequirements as to light, air and ventilation. These features are\r\nillustrated by the sectional views.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Live Stock_--The live stock receiving pens for cars and wagons are\r\nlocated on the ground as shown on plans, and a long ramp is arranged\r\nfor the slow driving of hogs. Again, all products are passed downward\r\nin the process of manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Icing Department_--Facilities are provided for harvesting ice from a\r\nstream situated north of the premises. The railroad tracks extend to\r\nthe ice storage houses where facilities are provided for icing cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pork Building_--Advantage was taken of the relative grouping and the\r\nspace available to provide an open air hanging or drying room for\r\nhogs at a level of the killing floor and hog chill rooms. The hogs\r\npass through this space on their way to the cooler. The pork building\r\nis arranged with chilling rooms on the upper floor and curing rooms\r\nbeneath on all floors to and including the basement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manufacturing Building_--Adjacent to the cooler building, space is\r\nprovided for the making of sausage, cutting hogs, and trimming of\r\nsausage meat, processing of meats for smoking, packing and shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Power Department_--This is a minor matter since the electric current\r\nis purchased from a municipal lighting corporation, and the plant being\r\nin a cold climate, advantage is taken of these conditions.\r\n\r\nNote that in this plant every department except the killing department,\r\nwhich was made as large a unit as appeared to be necessary, may be\r\nextended without in any manner disturbing the relative situation of the\r\ndepartments. The uses of the several floors are shown in the sectional\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plant No. 3.=--Type of plant. The diagram (Fig. 12) is illustrative\r\nof a small local plant situated in a southwestern city, and built\r\nprincipally for a local mixed business. The plant will properly\r\ntake care of one hundred hogs and fifty cattle daily, the necessary\r\nby-products and the manufacturing departments, therefor. An ice\r\nbusiness is operated in conjunction with this plant. The buildings are\r\nchiefly two stories in height. The plan and sectional drawings are\r\nsufficiently explicit to require no description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--PLANT NO. 3, GROUND PLAN OF SMALL LOCAL\r\nPACKING HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plant No. 4.=--The accompanying vignette and ground plan are\r\nillustrative of an alongside deep water export plant. The photograph\r\nof front view illustrates the loading facilities which show ramps\r\nor inclines upon which conveyors are operated. These endless chains\r\nconvey beef in quarter to the wharf at right angles thereto, where it\r\nis picked off the rail by ship’s tackle and lowered into the ship’s\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the plant arrangement, note the position of the slaughter\r\nhouse with relation to the coolers and trace the movement of the\r\nproducts to the coolers, rendering, wool house. Also the further\r\nmovement of the products to shipment. Particular attention is called\r\nto the arrows indicating the direction of growth of every department\r\nwithout disarranging the first intention as to movement, and minimizing\r\nthe labor on the extended plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--PLANT NO. 4, SHOWING DEEP WATER EXPORT PLANT.]\r\n\r\nThe steam producing department is in close proximity to the steam\r\nusing buildings, viz: Power Department, Rendering House, Fertilizer\r\nand Slaughter House. Preference being given over electricity or\r\nrefrigeration which can be transmitted longer distances at less loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Build.=--The question of design being settled the next\r\nmatter of importance is the one involving the materials to be used\r\nin construction. That becomes a matter of investment and permanent\r\nsize or location of the buildings. Fireproof buildings are desirable\r\non account of low cost of upkeep and a lower insurance rate. They\r\nare permanent in every way, but the difficult question is that of\r\nmodifying, provided changes become necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--PLANT NO. 4, GROUND PLAN FOR EXPORT PACKING\r\nHOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fireproof Design.=--If decision is made for a fireproof building,\r\nre-inforced concrete is the first suggestion owing to its universal\r\nuse as a building material, but there are several points to be given\r\nserious consideration before reaching a decision. One of these points\r\nbeing how to insulate so as to prevent losses. This matter will be\r\ntaken up in a subsequent chapter describing a cold storage warehouse of\r\neminent design. It is one of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Advantages of Fireproof Construction.=--The fireproof buildings have\r\nnaturally a very great advantage in permanence from a standpoint of\r\ncost of upkeep and insurance charges, and from the greater loss of a\r\ncessation of business incident to destruction by fire. In most plants\r\nthere are sufficient departments of such staple character so unlikely\r\nto be changed that it appears judicious to make them fireproof.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Slow Burning Construction.=--Many people are quite content with\r\nbuildings of moderate height of slow burning construction; otherwise,\r\na modified type of “mill construction” and with the use of sprinkler\r\nsystems which minimize the insurance costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Approval of Plans.=--There are many points in building construction\r\nto take care of in the matter of design, to meet the requirements of\r\nthe insurance interests and local city building department regulations,\r\nwhich in the main coincide. Before entering into a contract to\r\nconstruct, it is well to have the drawings approved by the insurance\r\nboards and the city inspection bureau. It obviates expensive changes\r\nand additions. To build in such a manner as to bring the insurance\r\nrates to a minimum is certainly desirable. It is an advantage, too,\r\nto have the plant divided so that in case of fire the spread of the\r\nflames can be retarded and the fire confined to the building where it\r\noriginated, or if some of the buildings are burned the balance can be\r\nsaved. Fires invariably represent, to a well managed business, a far\r\ngreater loss than is collectible on the insurance policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nREFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n  AMMONIA MACHINES -- AMMONIA -- COMPRESSOR -- CONDENSER -- RECEIVER --\r\n  COOLER -- CONDENSING WATER -- UNIT BASIS -- COMPUTING FROM UNIT BASIS\r\n  -- HOW RATED -- FREEZER REQUIREMENTS -- FREEZERS IN SMALL PLANTS --\r\n  CYLINDER ARRANGEMENT -- WHY BRINE CIRCULATION -- AIR CIRCULATING\r\n  -- FORCE DRAFT -- COIL ROOM SYSTEMS -- BRINE CHILLING -- BRINE\r\n  METHODS -- TYPES OF BRINE COOLERS -- BALANCED BRINE SYSTEM -- DIRECT\r\n  EXPANSION -- TWO-STAGE COMPRESSORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mechanical Refrigerating Equipment.=--This agent is of great\r\nconsequence in the operation of packing houses, and, therefore, it\r\nis deemed essential to explain the principles briefly; as well as to\r\ndescribe the uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ammonia Machines.=--The use of ammonia refrigeration equipment either\r\nabsorption or compression has so generally displaced all others for\r\nstationary or land use, and particularly in meat plants and cold\r\nstorage houses, that for the present purpose it is unnecessary to\r\ngo into a discussion of others. The compression system being so\r\npredominant in its use, a description of same is given.\r\n\r\nThe diagram indicates a compression system in elementary form\r\nconsisting of:\r\n\r\n(1) A pump or compressor which withdraws the gas from the cooler or\r\nexpansion tank, prepares and passes it to the condenser.\r\n\r\n(2) The condenser or liquifier which gives to the water flowing over it\r\nthe heat carried to it by the gas from the cooler.\r\n\r\n(3) The cooler or expansion tank in which the heat extracted from the\r\ncarcasses, the building walls or elsewhere, is passed to the ammonia\r\ngas for conveyance to the condenser.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ammonia.=--Leaving for a moment the description of the apparatus to\r\nacquaint the reader with ammonia: In the form used in a compression\r\nrefrigerating machine, it bears the name “liquid anhydrous ammonia”\r\nmeaning in a “dry liquid” form differentiating from the common\r\nhousehold ammonia which is a water solution containing ammonia gas in\r\nvariable quantity. The distinction between these two is that “anhydrous\r\nammonia” will evaporate to naught; from household ammonia the gas will\r\nevaporate but the water will remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--DIAGRAM SHOWING AMMONIA COMPRESSION SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nAmmonia is a chemical compound made up of one part nitrogen and three\r\nparts hydrogen and is expressed by the chemical symbol NH₃. It has some\r\npeculiar characteristics being analogous to water. It will assume a\r\nsolid, liquid and gaseous form, at -115° F. and -28¹⁄₂° F. for solid\r\nand liquid respectively and will modify to a gaseous form at any\r\ntemperature above -28¹⁄₂° F. under “atmospheric” or conditions of no\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nWater, as is known, changes from a liquid to a solid at 32° F. and\r\nchanges to a vaporous form at 212° F. but here the analogy ceases.\r\n\r\nAmmonia has further peculiar advantages for use in refrigerating\r\nproduction that it becomes a liquid at variable pressures and\r\ntemperatures; for example, when the temperature is reduced to 60° F.\r\nunder a pressure of 92 pounds, when reduced to 80° under a pressure of\r\n139 pounds and at 100°, under a pressure of 200 pounds; with variables\r\nabove, between and below these conditions. Ammonia, as will be seen,\r\nhas variable forms and capacities under the conditions imposed upon it.\r\nSubstances passing from a liquid to a gaseous form require heat to make\r\nthis change and consequently absorb it; the complement to the giving\r\nup of heat when the process is reversed and the substance changed\r\nfrom a gaseous to a liquid form. The adoption or harnessing of these\r\nprinciples is the nucleus upon which mechanical refrigerating effect is\r\nbuilt. A pound of water passing to steam will absorb about one thousand\r\ndegrees of heat, ammonia has the same characteristic to a different\r\ndegree. They both return the heat when the process is reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Type of Machine Illustrated.=--The diagram illustrates a single acting\r\npump showing its piston, a liquifier or condenser where the ammonia is\r\nmodified in form from a gas as received therein to a liquid; a receiver\r\nto which it flows and a cooler in which it is expanded and where the\r\nheat brought to it by the returning brine is picked up by the ammonia\r\nand carried to the condenser. The arrows indicate the direction of flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Compressor.=--The “Compressor” is a pump, a cylinder fitted with\r\na piston which withdraws the ammonia from the tank in which it is\r\nexpanded. The piston is tightly fitted and when it travels in one\r\ndirection, the gas flows in, filling the space, like any ordinary\r\npump whether it be a water or gas pump. Upon the return stroke, the\r\ngas is compressed in the cylinder until the pressure in the piston is\r\nsufficient to equal or overcome that exerted against it accumulated in\r\nthe condenser, when it is discharged thereto. There are spring actuated\r\nvalves interposed in the line of gas travel which close and retain in\r\nthe condenser that gas which has been discharged, allowing the piston\r\nand compressor to repeat the just described performance many times per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Condenser.=--The use of this element is to liquify the ammonia, really\r\nto extract the heat absorbed by the ammonia in the cooler and the heat\r\ngenerated in the compression. This condensing operation changes the\r\nform of the substance from gaseous to liquid. The most simple style\r\nof condenser is a series of pipes stacked together with ammonia on\r\nthe inside of the several pipes, and water flowing over the outside.\r\nThe gas on leaving the compressor is hot and at a high temperature,\r\nfrequently as high as 250° F. or more, and the pressure from 140 to 220\r\nlbs., depending upon the water supply, its temperature and quantity,\r\nand the area of the surface of the condenser.\r\n\r\nThe water flowing over the condenser absorbs the heat from within, the\r\nammonia becoming cooled by contact with the comparatively cool walls\r\nof the pipe while flowing from one end to the other of the condensing\r\ncoil, gradually changing from a gaseous to a liquid form.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Receiver.=--From the condenser the liquid ammonia is collected in the\r\nreceiver so as to have a quantity stored for use and in reserve for the\r\nfluctuating requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Expansion Valve.=--A small but important item in the system is the\r\nexpansion valve which is a valve with a controllable opening and\r\ncomparatively small. This is interposed in the line between the liquid\r\nreceiver and the cooler or expansion tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooler or Expansion Tank.=--The next element is the cooler in whatever\r\nform it may exist, whether it be ammonia coils submerged in brine\r\ntank, shell and tube cooler built like a boiler in which the ammonia\r\nsurrounds the tube through which the brine solution is pumped, or\r\nammonia “direct” expansion coils in the air within a room, it matters\r\nnot. At this point the heat given off by the substance to be cooled is\r\nabsorbed by the ammonia and taken up for discharge to the water flowing\r\nover the condenser.\r\n\r\nNo substance will change from a liquid to a gaseous form unless heat be\r\nsupplied to perform the work of making this change. At the outset it\r\nwas stated ammonia will boil or evaporate at 28¹⁄₂° below zero Fahr.\r\nwhen under no pressure or in the open air. Further, if ammonia be\r\ncontained in a vessel and the pressure be reduced below atmosphere,\r\nthe boiling point is lowered still further. For example at 10.6 vacuum\r\ngauge pressure the boiling point will be 40° below zero.\r\n\r\nImagine a brine cooler such as a tank with coil submerged and\r\nsurrounded by a brine solution: This brine is circulated through\r\nthe building and by common knowledge we know it absorbs heat and is\r\nreturned warmer than it was sent out. It is supplying the heat for\r\nboiling the ammonia gas.\r\n\r\nReverting to the expansion valves: Assume there is a pressure of 180\r\npounds in the condenser and a liquid temperature of perhaps 85 to 90\r\ndegrees; the same conditions existing in the receiver; also assume\r\na pressure of 15 pounds on the ammonia coils which will produce a\r\ntemperature condition of zero. In the diagram, the coil in the tank\r\nis attached to the expansion valve while on the other end of the coil\r\nis made the connection to the pump or compressor. This by its action\r\nis withdrawing the ammonia gas as rapidly as it is generated, due to\r\nthe tightness of the piston, which if it is properly fitted will pump\r\na vacuum upwards of 22 to 25 inches upon the system attached to it,\r\nunless gas be supplied to fill the space. In operation, the expansion\r\nvalve is opened slightly, the liquid is freed into a space where the\r\npressure is lowered, a condition created for expanding the ammonia to\r\na gas and the heat contributed by the surrounding brine is absorbed by\r\nthe ammonia changing from a liquid to a gaseous form.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cycle.=--The cycle, therefore, is a gas in the expansion tank at\r\nlow pressure and temperature, admitted to the pump or compressor under\r\nthis condition, compressed to a small volume and increased in pressure,\r\ndischarged in this condition to the condenser where it becomes a liquid\r\nand in a condensed form at a lowered temperature and ready to return to\r\nthe expansion tank to be used over again.\r\n\r\nAmmonia gas is the heat carrier. If it be used in packing house\r\nservice, either it absorbs the heat directly from the rooms in which\r\nthe animals are suspended or the brine in the tank is circulated\r\nthrough the rooms to absorb the heat and carry it back to the cooler or\r\nexpansion tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Condensing Water.=--In Chapter II reference was made to the condensing\r\nwater for refrigerating system. This is important because the lower\r\nits temperature, the less the pressure will be created which means the\r\nless the power must be exerted in the production of the mechanical\r\nrefrigerating effect. The water flowing over the condenser carries\r\nthe heat to the sewer. Thus the heat from the carcasses, the sun heat\r\non the walls of the building, the actinic rays through the windows,\r\nthe heat from the men employed within, that from the electric lights\r\nwithin, and that absorbed from the earth upon which the building stands\r\nmust all be collected and eventually passed into the sewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Absorption Equipment.=--Absorption refrigeration equipment is used to\r\nsome extent in packing house work, but its complexity makes unnecessary\r\nan attempt of its description in this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Unit Basis.=--The unit basis of refrigeration commonly used in\r\nexpressing quantity is tons of refrigeration, meaning the tons of\r\nrefrigerating duty that can be performed per day of twenty-four hours.\r\nThe standard measurement per ton as adopted by the American Society of\r\nRefrigerating Engineers, is a cooling effect equal to 288,000 B.t.u.,\r\nbeing equivalent to the extraction of this quantity of heat from any\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nIt has been established by the Bureau of Standards that in freezing one\r\npound of water at 32° F., to ice at 32° F., 143.5 British thermal units\r\nof heat must be withdrawn from the water. For convenience in practice\r\nthe fractional part is ignored, and 144 B.t.u. per pound of water is\r\naccepted as standard in calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Computing From Unit Basis.=--If 144 B.t.u. are withdrawn from each\r\npound of water at 32° F. to convert the water into ice at the same\r\ntemperature, the melting of the pound of ice at the same temperature\r\nmust re-absorb an equal heat in the process of freezing, consequently\r\nthe melting of one ton (2,000 pounds) of ice to water at the same\r\ntemperature would absorb 2,000 × 144 B.t.u., or 288,000 B.t.u., the\r\naccepted standard for computing the heat absorbed in the performance of\r\none ton of refrigeration duty. In ice melting this absorption of heat\r\nis _latent_, not sensible to the thermometer, as no change is apparent\r\nby thermometer test in the temperature of the ice and the water,\r\nnevertheless an appreciable _cooling_ of surrounding is measurable\r\nby thermometer wherever ice melting takes place; for example, in an\r\nair-tight room, or in contact with solid substances, or with liquids,\r\nhaving a higher temperature than 32° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How Rated.=--The rating of refrigerating compressors as usually stated\r\nby manufacturers is expressed in tons. This refers to the tons of duty\r\nthat a machine will develop in a period of twenty-four hours continuous\r\noperation under assumed conditions of about fifteen pounds gauge, back\r\nor suction pressure, and 185 pounds head pressure. To perform this\r\nduty the compressor should be of sufficient size to displace or pump\r\na volume of gas equal to 4¹⁄₄ cubic feet per minute. This rating of\r\nthe machine is proper when you are producing temperatures of about\r\n32° F. or over, and presupposes the plant to be properly balanced as\r\nto condensers, and to be properly provided with liquid receivers, oil\r\nextractors and other complementary equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Freezer-Requirement.=--The growing demand for freezer space in and\r\nabout packing houses, however, is so important that special means and\r\nmethods must be provided to meet the conditions. It is impossible\r\nto produce freezer temperatures and conditions under the same back\r\npressure as described above; the back pressures must be lowered and\r\nin doing so the capacity of the compressor is reduced very rapidly.\r\nThe same compressor producing one hundred tons refrigeration duty at\r\nfifteen pounds back pressure and 185 pounds head pressure will only\r\nperform half the work when operating under a back pressure of five\r\npounds, the head pressure remaining the same.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser must never lose sight of the fact that in cooling freezer\r\nspaces the compressor capacity is reduced practically by half and that\r\nthis is applicable to all portions of the system working under these\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=System to Adopt.=--No hard and fast rule can be adopted regarding\r\nthe system of refrigeration to be adopted, whether by use of brine\r\ncirculation or direct expansion. The case in hand and the nature of the\r\nbusiness to be done seems to govern. For example, if the plant in which\r\nthe business is mixed, wherein hogs, cattle and sheep are killed,\r\ncuring performed, and lard made, with a limited amount of freezing,\r\nbrine circulation for general use would seem the better. The excellent\r\nresults obtained by the use of spray coolers, later described, seem to\r\npoint to its use in chilling coolers, with brine circulated through\r\nceiling or wall coils for cooling storage rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Freezers in Small Plants.=--If the plant be quite moderate in size\r\nand only sufficient to justify the installation of one compressor the\r\namount of space required for freezing purposes is thus limited, and if\r\ncommercial freezer space is available it is a question as to whether\r\nthe operator can afford to deplete his small equipment capacity by\r\ninstalling freezers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--SUCTION CONNECTION FOR DUO-PURPOSE COMPRESSOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cylinder Arrangements.=--If the plant be sufficiently large so that\r\nthe machine equipment can be afforded in two units then it would be\r\nproper to install freezers. Supposing then that the plant justifies\r\nthis arrangement the compressors would be connected to the brine\r\ntank for chilling purposes, and to the closed cooler for circulating\r\npurposes. The gland end of the compressors would be arranged so that\r\nthey could be operated independently upon the freezer space at will.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Why Brine Circulation.=--The chief reason for using brine in the\r\nmoderate sized plant is that with a reasonably large brine capacity\r\nthere is a reserve cold (so to speak) stored in the brine which will\r\npermit of stopping the compressor, the brine continuing in circulation\r\nby pumping, and there is less likelihood of changes in temperature.\r\nDirect expansion chilling requires an almost constant machine operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Air Circulating.=--The chilling of packing houses and methods involved\r\nare various, each with its advocates. In Europe and where English\r\nmethods are followed the system is chiefly forced draft. This system\r\nhas been used to some extent in the United States, but the majority of\r\nthe coolers are handled with lofts, and circulation therefrom is of\r\nnatural sequence. The cellars and freezers are handled by pipes hung in\r\nthe rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Force Draft.=--The force draft or indirect cooling system consists of\r\nforcing chilled air, cooled by passing through batteries of expansion\r\ncoils operated dry, or over which brine is passed, through a series\r\nof ducts, and withdrawing it; thence passing it through the coils and\r\nrepeating. It is not favored among American packers owing to a belief\r\nthat it increases shrinkage, and tends to darken beef; that large\r\nquantities of cold air are lost through open doors; because of the\r\nexpense of operating fans, as well as the room taken up by ducts and\r\nthe interference occasioned with meat rails.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coil Room Systems.=--The overhead bunker system as described under\r\n“_Construction_” in this work details the application of the United\r\nStates practice.\r\n\r\nAccepting the use of the coil room system and of still storage the\r\nquestion arises as to the application. A visit of inspection to the\r\nvarious packing plants throughout America will impress one with the\r\nfact of the existence of a wide variation of opinion and practice with\r\nregard to the methods of applying refrigeration for packing house\r\npurposes. There are two principal applications--direct expansion,\r\nwherein the ammonia gas is circulated through the coils throughout the\r\npremises, and brine circulation, open or closed, where chilled brine is\r\ncirculated throughout the works.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brine Chilling.=--The two types of brine chilling, open and closed,\r\nproduce the same result, except as to the actual brine cooler, of which\r\nthere are several, namely:\r\n\r\n(1) Brine tank in which are submerged ammonia expansion coils.\r\n\r\n(2) Double or triple pipe coolers in which brine and ammonia are\r\ncirculated in annular spaces between pipes.\r\n\r\n(3) Shell type coolers in which the brine is passed through tubes\r\nwithin a shell similar to an ordinary flue boiler.\r\n\r\nFor a close brine system, which is the term applied to a system where\r\nbrine is circulated through pipes and not exposed to the atmosphere\r\nso as to absorb moisture, the shell type cooler is a convenient and\r\neconomical means of chilling brine. It is so readily applicable to the\r\nuse of a balanced system, thereby lessening the power requirement for\r\npumping.\r\n\r\nDouble pipe coolers can be used in the same method, but are not quite\r\nso favorably considered owing to the aggregate quantity of joints.\r\n\r\nEither the shell type cooler or the double pipe cooler can be safely\r\nused with an open system. The open type brine system is any system used\r\nwherein the cooling effect is produced by bringing the cold brine in\r\ndirect contact with the air to be chilled, as in the spray system, the\r\n“Gardner” sheet system, or an open pan system.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brine Methods--Recommendation.=--Where it would seem best for other\r\nreasons to use a brine system, and the plant would justify the\r\nexpenditure, it would appear well to use a double brine system--open\r\nbrine in the hog chill rooms, and a closed system on the freezers, beef\r\nchill rooms, storage rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Types of Brine Coolers.=--Open tanks with submerged coils are used on\r\nsome plants. The investment is greater, but the risk is slightly less\r\nthan in the use of closed type brine coolers, commonly called shell and\r\ntube type. Unless the engineering force of the plant is fully qualified\r\nand alert, there is danger of diluted brine and freezing the solution\r\nin shell type coolers, which is likely to split the tubes, causing\r\nleaks and the possibility of brine finding its way to the ammonia\r\ncompressors, rendering them liable to damage of a serious nature.\r\nWhereas, with the open type tank and submerged coils, weakened brine\r\nmight cause ice to form on the expansion pipes and render them inert,\r\nbut no comparable damage could arise. However, we advocate an alert\r\nengineering force and the closed system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--DIAGRAM SHOWING BALANCED BRINE SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Balanced Brine System.=--The balanced brine system as referred to in\r\nthe preceding, is indicated by diagram and has the advantage of keeping\r\nthe pipes full at all times, also of reducing the power requirement to\r\nthe actual friction through the pipes in the shell type cooler, and a\r\nslight increase for passing through the coils. In practice twenty to\r\ntwenty-five pounds friction represents the total head to pump against\r\nin a building nine stories high. The two types of the balanced brine\r\nsystem are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Open System._--Beginning at shell and tube coolers the brine passes\r\ninto supply pipes which decrease in size as they approach the ends. The\r\nreturn line tapers in opposite direction. The pressure carried is only\r\nsufficient to make a sufficiently rapid circulation.\r\n\r\nA small pump is inserted in the line so that the pressure can be\r\nincreased on that portion through the spray nozzles. This lessens the\r\npower over carrying the entire system at a high pressure.\r\n\r\nThe balance tank is located at such point as will best serve to collect\r\nthe brine from closed coils and the return from the spray coolers. A\r\nvacuum valve is put on the closed line to prevent siphon.\r\n\r\nA return connection to the main pumps is made, and also connections to\r\nthe concentrator from balance tank so that a portion of the brine can\r\nbe concentrated.\r\n\r\nThis system requires more concentration than the closed system. It has\r\nthe advantage that coolers can be used as sharp freezers if insulation\r\nbe proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Closed System._--Beginning at shell and tube coolers the discharge\r\nmains and piping are the same as for the open system. Return mains as\r\nindicated. Balance tank is located elevated above upper coils.\r\n\r\nA localized defrosting system is installed with individual pump\r\ncirculating brine over coils, continuously as required. The collecting\r\ntank is located as near as convenient to lessen pumping head. The brine\r\nflowing over coils in the lofts is concentrated to a strength equal to\r\ncirculating brine and introduce into circulation replenishing brine for\r\ndefrosting from mains. Concentrator is located where suitable.\r\n\r\nIn using closed coils the arrangement is different for beef and hogs so\r\nas to assist in the circulation for hog cooler with a view to producing\r\nuniform temperatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--CONCENTRATING ARRANGEMENT, BALANCE BRINE\r\nSYSTEM, CLOSED TYPE.]\r\n\r\nIn any system using open brine, there is a quite appreciable gain in\r\nthe quantity of brine in the system, and a weakening of its strength\r\nlowering the freezing point. This necessitates vigilance as if the\r\nbrine weaken too much there is a possibility of it freezing solidly and\r\ninsulating submerged coils in an open brine tank rendering them inert\r\nor splitting the pipes in a shell type cooler with disastrous results.\r\nIt is consequently necessary to evaporate the brine which can be done\r\nwith a concentrator as provided for in Figs. 17 and 18.\r\n\r\nThe concentrator apparatus consists of a balance or storage tank in\r\nelevated position according to whether the closed or open system is\r\nused; one or more stands of pipe coils; a catch pan for concentrated\r\nbrine; a reservoir and a small pump for passing brine into system.\r\nThe brine flows from storage tank, entering the bottom pipe of the\r\ncoils and passes upward through seventeen pipes, from which point it\r\nis delivered to the trough at the top of the coil and allowed to flow\r\ndown over the entire battery of pipes, steam being circulated through\r\nthe top six pipes, thus heating the brine and concentrating it by\r\nevaporation. The hot concentrated brine is cooled as it passes over the\r\nlower seventeen pipes through which it originally entered as cold weak\r\nbrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Direct Expansion.=--Many plants are equipped completely with direct\r\nexpansion systems. This is quite satisfactory provided means are\r\narranged to dispose of the accumulating ice and snow on the coils.\r\nThis is particularly applicable to coils in pipe lofts where moisture\r\nrapidly accumulates, and is accomplished by some arrangement of\r\ndefrosting such as circulating a brine over coils by permitting it to\r\ndrip over the coils, pumping over and over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Two-Stage Compressors.=--The revising editor brought into prominence\r\nthe two-stage compression system by building a successfully operating\r\nplant which functioned with quite astounding results. The system\r\nconsists of a large low temperature gas compressor and a smaller second\r\nstage compressor, arranged the reverse to a compound steam engine.\r\n\r\nAmmonia gas which at the low temperatures resulting when low\r\nback-pressures are required, becomes highly attenuated (light), it\r\nis necessary to handle a very large volume per ton of refrigeration\r\ndeveloped. To provide for this, the low pressure cylinder is made about\r\ndouble the volume of the high pressure cylinder.\r\n\r\nIn the low pressure cylinder the gas is compressed to a pre-determined\r\npressure and passed at a relatively high pressure, making for a very\r\nhigh efficiency. The gas is chilled by the introduction of expanded\r\nammonia to take up the superheat.\r\n\r\nThe use of this compressor arrangement with its refinement makes an\r\neconomical cold producing unit. A record of one year’s run follows:\r\n\r\nTWO-STAGE COMPRESSION SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n                                           Per      Per\r\n                                          year.    ton.\r\n  Tons received                           60,000\r\n  Cu. ft. space cooled                 2,930,000\r\n\r\n  Coal cost                           $17,309.11   .288\r\n  Labor                                15,156.73   .252\r\n  Oil and waste                         1,030.82   .017\r\n  Water and chemicals                   2,103.21   .035\r\n  Repairs and changes                   1,698.38   .028\r\n                                      ----------   ----\r\n      Total cost                      $37,298.25   .62\r\n  Expense per cu. ft. space per year               .013\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ample Capacity.=--All of the above factors must be considered in the\r\ncalculations for refrigerating requirements, and it is best to make\r\nallowances for a considerable factor of safety over and above the\r\nactual maximum, as well as for the economical operation of the plant.\r\nIt never pays to crowd a plant to its limit or capacity. Guard against\r\nemergencies and possible abnormal demand for refrigeration by providing\r\nample equipment. The plant should be constructed as far as possible in\r\nduplicate, not only as regards the machinery but also in the apparatus,\r\nas a safeguard against accidents and total cessation of refrigeration.\r\nWith two machines and duplicate apparatus one-half the maximum\r\nrefrigeration is always available, and the preservation of the product\r\nin storage is assured, even if it be found necessary to stop killing\r\nfor a sufficient period to make the repairs on the broken machinery or\r\napparatus, while with one machine only available, a breakdown might\r\nresult in a very serious loss and considerable damage to the stored\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nWith regard to insulation, it may be said that the best is the\r\nmost economical in the long run. There is no such thing as absolute\r\ninsulation, some heat leakage must occur through the very best\r\ninsulation, and the reduction of this heat leakage to the minimum\r\nshould be the chief object or factor for consideration. First-class\r\ninsulation costs more in original investment, but it creates a\r\ncontinuous saving and economy in refrigeration, resulting oftentimes in\r\na less investment also in refrigerating, pumping and steam equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nREFRIGERATION REQUIREMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REFRIGERATION -- NECESSITIES -- ICE PLANTS -- NATURAL ICE -- CHILLING\r\n  -- QUANTITY REFRIGERATION TO PROVIDE -- SPACE PER TON MACHINE --\r\n  MACHINERY PER HEAD -- ICE COMPUTATION -- COMPRESSOR CAPACITY --\r\n  SUMMARY COMPUTATIONS -- LOW TEMPERATURE BRINE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Refrigeration.=--This word covers the “bugbear” and the “solace” of\r\nthe packers. No other one thing is of so much importance. Since the\r\nabolishment of the use of chemicals, such as borax, boracic acid, etc.,\r\nas a preventive or retardant in the propagation of bacilli during\r\nthe curing process, the packer’s sole dependence is refrigeration.\r\nConsequently there has been considerable development and importance in\r\nits use.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the animal is killed until the parts are disposed of,\r\nrefrigeration is a necessity. The proportion of freezing space to be\r\nprovided or hired at a commercial storage house is growing daily. In\r\nmany plants the total volume of freezer space approaches or exceeds,\r\nthat given over for moderate temperature storage purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Necessities.=--In the order of progress the first necessity for\r\nrefrigeration is the use of ice for chilling water for fats and meats.\r\nPractically every packing house is now equipped with a small ice making\r\nplant both for its use, and with commercial possibilities of selling\r\nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ice Plants.=--Ice plants are of various kinds:\r\n\r\n  (1) Common ice made from filtered water without processing.\r\n\r\n  (2) Raw water ice made from filtered or treated water, aerated or\r\n  agitated, while freezing.\r\n\r\n  (3) Distilled water ice made from condensed steam, reboiled.\r\n\r\n  (4) Plate ice, made from raw water in large plates and cut up into\r\n  blocks of convenient size.\r\n\r\nIn the production of distilled water there are various methods which\r\nwill not be treated upon here.\r\n\r\nFor the icing of cars and for ordinary cooling purposes ice made by\r\nprocess No. 1 is amply good except, perhaps, if the water from which\r\nthe ice is made should not be clear, it may be necessary to use a\r\nportion of the bottom of the cake for car icing purposes only.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Natural Ice.=--The situation and climate has much to do with the\r\ndetermination as to whether the packer can afford to harvest natural\r\nice for general use. For example, if the plant be situated in a\r\nnorthern climate alongside a suitable stream adjacent to the plant,\r\nthe harvesting of ice and its storage can be afforded. However, if the\r\nice is stored at a remote point and teaming or car shipment of ice\r\nis necessary, then the manufacturing plant will probably be the more\r\neconomical.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chilling.=--The chilling of the meat immediately after killing is\r\nperhaps the most important function in the whole refrigerating process\r\nand one that cannot have too much attention. In the matter of beef it\r\nis the practice of the best operators to see to it that immediately\r\nafter the hide is removed the beef is placed in the coolers. At most it\r\nshould not be allowed to stand out in the open air to exceed half an\r\nhour. Sheep and veal should be treated in the same manner. As for hogs\r\nin some climates, such as latitude equal to Chicago or north thereof,\r\nif space is available an open air hanging room is a valuable adjunct\r\nwhere the animal can be air dried, depending upon seasons, from one\r\nhour to over night. This feature also permits of increased slaughtering\r\nduring the winter season. It is a custom that can be abused, however,\r\nby careless handling--resulting in sour meats.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quantity of Refrigeration to Provide.=--There are so many factors\r\nwhich enter into the question of packing house refrigeration, and\r\nso many details of construction and application of refrigerating\r\napparatus, that it is almost impossible to cover this subject\r\npractically and intelligibly without devoting a volume to refrigeration\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nTo give a fixed rule for packing house refrigeration, applicable to\r\nall conditions, would be impossible, as much depends upon conditions\r\nand surroundings, and the requirements would vary accordingly. For\r\ninstance, atmospheric conditions, quantity of space to be cooled,\r\ntemperature to be maintained, time for chilling, etc., these and\r\nmany other factors affecting the general results must be taken into\r\nconsideration and provided for, and as these vary, so will the\r\nrefrigeration requirements vary. A few ideas will be set out to assist\r\nin the computation of the quantity of equipment to provide.\r\n\r\nThe capacity or size of the refrigerating equipment required for any\r\ngiven plant is variable but can be reasonably closely computed by\r\nassuming certain conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Space Per Ton Machine.=--Practice has demonstrated that one ton of\r\nmechanical refrigerating effect duty, as rated by manufacturer used\r\ncontinuously during a period of twenty-four hours will maintain at a\r\ntemperature of 33° to 38° F. from 7,000 to 12,000 cubic feet of storage\r\nspace. Conditions of exposure, insulation and outside temperature\r\naffect this.\r\n\r\nThe minimum for beef storage coolers, the maximum for curing cellars.\r\nThe area of room or quantity of space enters into each of these\r\nassumptions. If small rooms are used the unit to be assumed is smaller.\r\nConcrete buildings are easier to control due to the stored cold in the\r\nbuilding mass of floors, columns and girders.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Machinery Per Head.=--It is customary to figure that in addition\r\nto that needed for cooling the space, one ton of refrigeration for\r\ntwenty-four hours would be required for either one of the following\r\nitems:\r\n\r\n  From fifteen to twenty-two hogs, average weight, 225 pounds.\r\n\r\n  From five to six head of cattle, average weight, 700 pounds.\r\n\r\n  About forty-five calves, average weight, 80 pounds.\r\n\r\n  From fifty to sixty-five sheep, average weight, 60 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=For Cooled Meats.=--For cold storage rooms, where meats which have\r\nalready been chilled or cooled are stored and held for a greater or\r\nlesser period, the refrigeration requirements are not so great as in\r\nchill and cooling rooms. The animal heat has been removed and the\r\nmeats cooled down to a low temperature, consequently but little more\r\nrefrigeration is required than that necessary to take care of the heat\r\nleakage through the insulation, and possibly the recooling of the meat\r\nthrough a range of a few degrees, when the meats may have gained a\r\nlittle in temperature by exposure. Therefore it is estimated that one\r\nton of refrigerating duty will handle 12,000 cubic feet of curing or\r\nstorage space for temperature of 33° to 35° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Freezer Space.=--As will be explained in the chapter relating to\r\nrefrigerating machine capacity, the capacity of a compressor very\r\nrapidly decreases when operating under conditions necessary to produce\r\nlow freezer temperatures, and owing to the severe conditions imposed\r\nit seems necessary to compute that one ton of refrigerating duty will\r\nhandle about 3,000 feet of freezer space.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ice Computations.=--Before the application of mechanical refrigeration\r\nto packing house purposes, all artificial refrigeration was\r\naccomplished by means of ice melting alone, and at that time the\r\npackers computed ice melting requirements on a basis of cooling three\r\npounds of meat from 80° F. to as low as it could be cooled by ice\r\nmelting, for each pound of ice melted. While this rule undoubtedly was\r\nthe result of practical experience with well constructed coolers, and\r\nwas in no wise based upon theoretical or heat unit formulas, yet it\r\nis interesting to note how close this old rule compares with modern\r\nformulas of computing refrigeration. For example, the cooling of 100\r\nhead of hogs, averaging 250 pounds dressed, by the packer’s rule, would\r\nrequire--\r\n\r\n  100 × 250\r\n  --------- = 8,333 pounds, or 4.16 tons ice melting.\r\n      3\r\n\r\nAnd on a heat unit basis, cooling the same number and weight of hogs\r\nfrom 80° to 32° F. would require--\r\n\r\n  100 × 250 × (80 - 32)\r\n  --------------------- = 4.166 tons refrigeration.\r\n        288,000\r\n\r\nThe above comparison shows that theory and practice approach very\r\nclosely to a common line, although in the calculation the factor of\r\nspecific heat of the meat is ignored, and in practice this may well be\r\nleft out, as specific heat of meats at various temperatures has by no\r\nmeans been accurately established.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chilling Lard.=--The chilling of lard is a severe task on\r\nrefrigerating equipment owing to the very heavy duty imposed in a short\r\ntime. For example, with an eight-foot lard roll turning off 4,000\r\npounds per hour and changing the temperatures of the lard from 90° to\r\n50° F. requires a very large compressor capacity per hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summary--Computations.=--Assuming the killing of 100 cattle and\r\n250 hogs per day; making 10,000 pounds of lard, fifteen tons ice;\r\nmaintaining a freezer of 100,000 cubic feet and the small work\r\nconnected with the establishment:\r\n\r\n  For 100 cattle killed daily, and storage of 400 hanging, about 6,500\r\n  square feet area of cooler would be required; the height of this with\r\n  the lofts would be about twenty-two feet or a capacity of 143,000\r\n  cubic feet.\r\n\r\n  For 250 hogs daily or 750 total hanging, there would be required\r\n  3,000 square feet of floor area and a height of 18 feet or 54,000 cu.\r\n  ft.\r\n\r\n  The above number of hogs daily would also require a storage or cellar\r\n  capacity based upon one hundred pounds meat sent to cellar for a turn\r\n  over in sixty days equal to storing 1,500,000 pounds of product, or\r\n  15,000 to 20,000 square feet of floor area, requiring 200,000 cubic\r\n  feet of building space.\r\n\r\n  Ten thousand pounds lard daily in four hours running would require\r\n  the extraction of about two tons of duty, but by reason of the heat\r\n  transmission and the low temperature brine necessary would require\r\n  twelve tons duty while applied.\r\n\r\n  Fifteen tons daily ice making capacity requires about 30 tons\r\n  refrigerating duty, allowing for radiation and other losses.\r\n\r\n  A freezer capacity of 100,000 cubic feet which would store 1,500,000\r\n  pounds would not appear excessive. From known results this would\r\n  require about one ton refrigerating duty for 3,000 cubic feet of\r\n  space or thirty-five tons machine duty. We have then:\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF REFRIGERATION REQUIRED\r\n\r\n                                                          Tons\r\n  143,000 cubic feet beef cooler space ÷ 10,000           14.3\r\n\r\n  100 cattle daily 500 pounds = 50,000 pounds\r\n  50,000 pounds meat chilled 70° or 70 B.t.u. per pound\r\n  50,000 × 70 = 3,500,000 ÷ 288,000 B.t.u.                12.2\r\n  54,000 cubic feet hog cooler space ÷ 10,000              5.4\r\n\r\n  250 hogs 180 pounds each = 45,000 pounds\r\n  45,000 × 70 ÷ 288,000 =                                 10.9\r\n  200,000 feet cellar space ÷ 12,000                      16.6\r\n  15 tons ice × 2 tons refrigerating duty                 30.0\r\n  10,000 pounds lard cooler                               12.0\r\n  100,000 cubic feet freezer space                        35.0\r\n                                                         -----\r\n  Total tonnage refrigerating effect                     136.4\r\n\r\n\r\n=Low Temperature Brine System.=--The use of low temperature brine,\r\ncooled by two stage compressors, a new development, is in the writer’s\r\nopinion preferable to direct expansion. (See description of two stage\r\ncompression in Chapter IV.) A lineal foot of pipe filled with a liquid\r\nlike chilled brine seems to have greater heat absorbing power than the\r\nsame pipe filled with a light gas and consequently less piping can be\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preference Reasons._--Occasion arose to compare for a new large\r\ninstallation the relative merits of direct expansion versus brine and\r\nthe following items suggested themselves:\r\n\r\n(1) The direct expansion plant would require 150,000 lbs. ammonia in\r\nexcess of brine plant.\r\n\r\n(2) There would be approximately 8,000 more joints to prevent leaking.\r\n\r\n(3) Unavoidable ammonia leakage through rods, glands, valve stems,\r\ncompressor rods and purging would amount to at least $20,000 per year\r\nbased on experience with good practice.\r\n\r\n(4) The installation by the same manufacturer estimated to cost 15%\r\nmore than a brine system.\r\n\r\n(5) There would be no stored energy in the ammonia pipes as in brine\r\npipes should the refrigerating plant suspend operation temporarily.\r\n\r\n(6) The compressor hazard from returning liquid and possible machine\r\nwrecking with line breaks, ammonia losses, and danger to life.\r\n\r\n(7) In case of extension or modification of piping, the difficulty with\r\nammonia pipes over brine is marked.\r\n\r\n(8) In direct expansion plants the cooling effect is stopped\r\nimmediately when the compressor is stopped. It is required to operate\r\nincessantly, or if speed be reduced the current is chiefly wasted in\r\nresistance grids if electrically driven. Whereas in a brine plant the\r\ncompressors can be stopped several hours, the brine being circulated\r\nrises in temperature but not sufficiently to vary room temperatures.\r\nThis is a great advantage, permitting keeping “off peaks” on commercial\r\nelectric lines and consequently earning lower rates.\r\n\r\n(9) With an electrically driven compressor, speed control is fixed\r\nwithin quite limited bounds and if direct expansion system is used\r\nmore power is purchased than needed for reasons already mentioned.\r\n\r\n(10) The total cost for operating pumps and calcium taken collectively\r\nwill be far less than the uncontrollable ammonia leakage. The coil\r\nattendants can be less skilled.\r\n\r\n(11) Brine temperature 25 degrees below zero, Fahr., can be carried,\r\nsufficiently low for all purposes. Rooms can not be controlled at as\r\nexact temperatures with direct expansion as with brine, owing to its\r\nsensitiveness.\r\n\r\n(12) Lastly and very important, the complicated piping system to\r\ncarry several back pressures to produce varying temperatures and the\r\nnecessity of operating several compressor “ends” makes a complicated\r\ninstallation of small units as against a simple system carrying one\r\ntemperature brine.\r\n\r\nPlants of the character described usually operate on direct expansion,\r\nrequire three sets of temperatures, three sets of suction pressures\r\nand three sets of suction mains with various cross connections and\r\nintricate pump-out arrangements. This necessitates multiplicity of\r\nmachines and connections to various cylinder ends.\r\n\r\nProgressive authorities recognize the necessity of freezer storage\r\nin meat plants. In combination pork and beef or pork plants, newer\r\ninstallations will be made with far less curing space for sweet pickled\r\nmeats and far greater space for storing meats frozen either before or\r\nafter curing to the end of producing palatable meats, not salt soaked\r\nand of inferior quality. There are slaughtering plants for export\r\nwhere beef is shipped chilled or frozen, and mutton frozen. Some have\r\nexclusive freezer buildings, others parts set aside for freezers.\r\n\r\nOne temperature brine is circulated, the temperature in the rooms\r\nbeing governed by the quantity of pipe in service. In all instances,\r\nsharp freezers, storage rooms and curing rooms are equipped with pipes\r\ntherein--and the chilling rooms for beef and pork closed coils or\r\nspray, optional.\r\n\r\nShell and tube coolers have proven so fitting that no hesitancy need be\r\nmade about using them, and the possibility of freezing is negligible\r\nwith reasonable prudence. Tanks with submerged coils can be used, but\r\nit prevents the saving made by using balanced brine pumping, on high\r\nbuildings, a quite material one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPOWER PLANT REQUIREMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  STEAM MAKING EQUIPMENT -- USES OF PUMPS -- TYPES OF PUMPS -- PUMPS\r\n  FOR BRINE -- WATER SUPPLY -- PUMPS FOR WELLS -- WATER DISTRIBUTION\r\n  SYSTEMS -- PUMPS FOR BOILER FEEDING -- HEATING BOILER FEED WATER\r\n  -- WELLS -- COOLING TOWERS -- ECONOMIZERS -- SUPERHEATERS -- STEAM\r\n  ENGINES -- EXHAUST STEAM -- ADVICE AS TO EXHAUST STEAM -- BOILERS --\r\n  CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Steam Making Equipment.=--The quantity and type of boilers needed for\r\na plant is entirely dependent upon the quantity of steam required and\r\nits economical or uneconomical use. The refrigerating and electric\r\nproducing apparatus in the average packing house are usually looked\r\nupon as the chief using elements, but they each frequently require less\r\nsteam than is used for pumping purposes, and less than is used for\r\ncooking and kindred operations. It would be well to discuss the uses of\r\nsteam and return to the boilers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Uses of Pumps.=--Pumps are used for water circulating, brine\r\ncirculating, boiler feeding and pumping products. These are named in\r\nthe order of their steam consuming demand as it usually occurs. They\r\nconsume from 40 to 120 pounds of steam per horse power hour based\r\non the kind of pump used and the skill in its operation. The most\r\neconomical are electrically operated centrifugal pumps provided the\r\ncurrent is economically generated, steam turbine centrifugal pumps,\r\nnext if in good condition, and reciprocating simplex or duplex pumps\r\nthird and fourth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Types of Pumps.=--The types chiefly used in packing house work are\r\nsimplex and duplex reciprocating, centrifugal single and multi-stage\r\noperated by motor or steam turbine directly attached to the motive\r\npower, also power pumps of triplex type and rotary or impeller pumps\r\nfor fats and oils. There are endless varieties of each type.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pumps for Brine.=--For brine pumping chiefly reciprocating and direct\r\nconnected horizontally set motor driven centrifugal pumps of one or\r\nmore stages are used. At times power operated triplex pumps are used\r\nbut the most satisfactory are the second named.\r\n\r\nPumping brine for refrigerating purposes is a never ending process\r\nsince it must be constantly performed. The common practice of an open\r\nbrine tank with submerged coils is being fast superseded by the use\r\nof shell and tube type closed coolers which superseded double pipe\r\ncoolers. The use of either the latter two types enables the operator\r\nto take advantage of hydraulic head by installing a balanced system\r\ndescribed in this work which very greatly reduces the power necessary\r\nto exert to pump brine. The friction in an eight to twelve pass brine\r\ncooler is from ten to fifteen pounds, and this with the pipe friction\r\non a balanced system will total to perhaps thirty pounds on large\r\nsystems, but less than the ordinary open system--depending upon the\r\nbuilding height.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water Supply.=--The water demand for packing house operation is quite\r\nan important element in relation to steam consumption. The quantity\r\nrequired for ammonia condensing, steam condensing (if done), and for\r\nplant purposes, washing, etc., is, in the aggregate, quite a large\r\namount. For example: For ammonia condensing, from 1¹⁄₄ to 1¹⁄₂ gallons\r\nper minute is required per ton of refrigeration developed; for steam\r\ncondensing for steam engine from 32 to 40 pounds per pound of steam\r\ncondensed; for boiler operation about four gallons per horse power per\r\nhour; for plant purposes from 250 to 3,000 gallons or more per hour,\r\ndepending upon the size of plant and its intelligent use. It will be\r\nreadily seen that those quantities will mount in power consumption if\r\nthe head or pressure pumped against is high.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pumps for Wells.=--Water pumped from wells is usually pumped by one of\r\nfour methods:\r\n\r\n  (1) Suction type reciprocating pumps.\r\n\r\n  (2) Deep well heads with low set pumping barrel.\r\n\r\n  (3) Submerged centrifugal pumps.\r\n\r\n  (4) Compressed air.\r\n\r\nFor small plants where one or two wells will supply the water, the\r\nfirst named pump is usually used owing to cheapness of cost for\r\ninstalling and particularly if the water rises in the well to a height\r\nreachable by a suction type pump, viz: 23 to 25 feet. Power operated\r\nsuction pumps are also available for this service. If the water be too\r\nlow for the above named type to handle, deep well pumps with steam head\r\nserve pretty well and usually cost less than air pumped wells.\r\n\r\nFor larger plants, larger wells are installed and submerged centrifugal\r\npumps or compressed air is used, the latter always as a last resort\r\nfrom a cost of pumping standpoint, although its simplicity and\r\nreliability appeals to many.\r\n\r\nSubmerged centrifugal pumps can be operated with steam turbine or motor\r\nset on top of shaft above ground. The motor operated set is the more\r\neconomical, particularly if the current be generated at low cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water Distribution Systems.=--The intelligent laying out of water\r\nsystems and the pressure pumped against is a factor worth great\r\nattention. It is far better to have pumps of proper proportions for the\r\nservice intended, even though it involves the use of a separated piping\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of water once raised to a high level in its return to\r\nservice is a power saving. For example: It is usual to locate ammonia\r\ncondensers at a point where there is a good circulation of air. This\r\nis done to permit the winds to carry away the moist air from about the\r\ncondensers, together with the heat delivered up through it and to the\r\nair by the discharged gas from the ammonia compressors. From the catch\r\npan beneath the ammonia condenser the water can be diverted through\r\nthe steam condenser and if the shell be bought sufficiently strong\r\nin the case of a closed condenser, the water can be delivered to the\r\nsuction side of a pump which in turn will deliver it for house use for\r\ncleansing purposes. If a barometric condenser is used, the water is\r\ndelivered to a hot well from whence it can be pumped or flow to sewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pumps For Boiler Feeding.=--Dependent upon the size of plant and the\r\npressure carried pumps are usually provided as follows:\r\n\r\n  Small boiler plant up to 500 H. P. low pressures. Steam 80 to 125\r\n  lbs. simplex or duplex piston packed reciprocating pumps.\r\n\r\n  Medium Boiler Plant up to 1,000 to 1,500 H. P. steam 125 to 150\r\n  pounds simplex or duplex outside piston packed reciprocating pumps.\r\n\r\n  Over 1,500 H. P. the same or centrifugal type multi-stage pump motor\r\n  or steam driven.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heating Boiler Feed Water.=--Every plant, large or small, should be\r\nequipped with boiler water heating devices. These are so common and the\r\npractice so usual that it is scarcely necessary to mention it but the\r\nwriter has seen plants where the exhaust steam from pumps and engines\r\nwas being thrown to the air and feed water pumped into boilers at low\r\ntemperatures. There are two types: closed and open. In the first named\r\nthe water is circulated through tubes enclosed in a vessel, the tubes\r\nsurrounded by steam. In the open type the steam is brought in direct\r\ncontact with the water and performs the heating in this manner. The\r\nclosed types are used on the principle that no oil carried in the steam\r\nis passed to the boilers, but the latter type are usually equipped with\r\nan oil separator that eliminates the oil and prevents danger from this\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wells.=--In most instances wells of various depths from 80 to 2,000\r\nfeet will find water. A few localities, however, do not yield water via\r\nwells and this is a poor situation from a packing house standpoint.\r\nThe water from surface or shallow wells is, at times, improper for use\r\non meats owing to contamination, in which case, resort must be made\r\nto other sources. In some localities the neighboring streams yield\r\nsuitable waters but in this case sewage contamination must be guarded\r\nagainst. The quality of boiler supply water is an important factor in\r\nthe boiler operation in its bearing to shutdowns for cleaning, blowing\r\ndown, repairs, etc., all of which contribute to or impair economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooling Towers.=--Where it is necessary to husband water for\r\ncondensing ammonia or steam the use of cooling towers comes into play.\r\nThese function by the cooling of water by evaporation, the evaporation\r\nabstracting the heat. There are various kinds--sprays over ponds, water\r\ndripping over spatter boards made in various ways, such as brush piled\r\nloosely; a checker work of wood slats; screen wire, etc. These usually\r\ndepend upon the circulation of air in a natural way. There are various\r\npatented types, depending upon fans, to pass air through falling water.\r\nThe efficiency is dependent upon the fineness of the water and the\r\nquantity of air passing through it, the relative humidity of the air\r\ncontrolling greatly the cooling effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Economizers.=--Where the utmost economy of fuel is striven for and on\r\nlarger plants, these are installed. An economizer is a bank of cast\r\niron flues placed in a position between the boilers and the smoke\r\nstack. Water is circulated through the tubes and the furnace gases\r\npass about them. They are usually calculated upon to decrease the\r\nstack temperatures from 100 to 150 degrees--dependent upon its initial\r\ntemperature and to heat the feed water one hundred degrees. This is a\r\nsaving from a wasted source, since it is impossible to take up this\r\nheat in any boiler yet designed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Superheaters.=--In an earlier chapter reference was made to\r\nsuperheated steam. The office of this apparatus is to heat the steam to\r\na higher point than it rises to, under ordinary boiler conditions. For\r\ninstance, steam as delivered from the nozzle of a boiler is spoken of\r\nas “saturated” steam, but, if before use this is subjected to a further\r\nheating before it is used, it is said to be “superheated.”\r\n\r\nSuperheaters are of two types. They can be described as follows: A bank\r\nof coils located in the flame pass in the boilers, the steam within the\r\ncoils and the flame on the outside; or a bank of coils in a separate\r\nfurnace, the flame or heat generated in the furnace passing over the\r\ncoils.\r\n\r\nSteam superheated beyond 450° F. total sensible temperature requires\r\nespecial pipe fittings, type of valves, and engines for reasonable safe\r\noperation, and renders an economy that a small plant cannot afford, due\r\nto the expenditure, to take advantage of.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Steam Engines.=--Owing to the cheapness of fuel in the United States,\r\nusers have been satisfied with equipment at a low initial cost and in\r\nconsequence pay bills continually by using uneconomical prime movers,\r\nviz.: ordinary steam engines of the simple Corliss type, using from 26\r\nlbs. to 35 lbs. of steam per horsepower hour, or compound condensing at\r\n15 lbs. to 18 lbs. of steam per horsepower hour or high speed direct\r\nconnected slide valve engine generator sets using from 35 to 50 lbs.\r\nsteam per horsepower, depending upon load.\r\n\r\nEuropean engineers, where fuel costs are double and triple American\r\nfuel costs, have of necessity paid more attention to the subject of\r\nsteam economy and have outstripped this country in design and use of\r\neconomical steam engines, notably of the so-called “uniflow,” “drop\r\nvalve,” “poppet valve,” or “Lentz” type and with the use of superheated\r\nsteam, have reached much higher efficiencies. The fast increasing costs\r\nof fuel in this country have necessitated American builders resorting\r\nto high steam pressures with independent or integral superheaters in\r\nconjunction with steam boilers, and as a result American manufacturers\r\nare offering simple uniflow engines for high speed (say 200 r. p. m.)\r\ndirect connection to electric generators. Also compound drop valve or\r\npoppet valve or Lentz types for slowly moving engines, viz.: 60 r. p.\r\nm. for connecting to ammonia compressors and in either case with steam\r\nat an initial pressure of 160 lbs. and ordinary superheat of 100°\r\noperating condensing, engines of the above types under the conditions\r\nnamed can be readily bought under guarantees to produce an indicated\r\nhorsepower with the use of 12 lbs. of steam per horsepower hour.\r\n\r\nThe uniflow engine is now offered by several builders and is adaptable\r\nto most any service, atmospheric exhaust, condensing or against a back\r\npressure using the exhaust for cooking or heating. There is but little\r\nadvantage, however, in a uniflow engine under this circumstance unless\r\nit be the flexibility as to conditions of operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Exhaust Steam.=--The practice of using exhaust steam, that is steam\r\nwhich has passed through engines, for heating and cooking is considered\r\neconomical. It is based upon the theory that the quantity of heat\r\ncontained in a pound of steam that has been reduced in pressure from\r\nits initial or high pressure, say 100, to a low one--example 5 lbs.,\r\nand then used for heating, etc., contains almost as many heat units as\r\nit did originally.\r\n\r\nThere are many places where this low pressure or exhaust steam can be\r\nused advantageously, but if extensively used, the likelihood will be\r\nto have long mains into which certain equipment will pass its exhaust\r\nand from which the demand will be spasmodic for cooking purposes and\r\nintermittent for heating, except during winter seasons, and as a result\r\nthere is a considerable quantity of steam passed to the air at most\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nA careful analysis is necessary for intelligent use of this idea,\r\nsince the maintaining of a balance owing to business fluctuations and\r\nchanging seasons makes an almost unmatchable combination. During one\r\nseason live steam will be used for make up, and at other times there is\r\na surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Advice As To Exhaust Steam.=--Aside from heating feed water and drying\r\nwhere the requirement is constant, a better practice is probably to\r\nlimit the extent of exhaust steam systems and use live steam for most\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe sources of exhaust steam, engines or pumps, are operating usually\r\ntwenty-four hours daily and constantly pouring steam into the exhaust\r\nmains, which is constantly radiating, leaking and the accumulated\r\nmoisture is being trapped away to a sewer or feed water heater. The\r\ntraps are usually just a little out of order, and the little leaks in\r\nmultiple mount up fast.\r\n\r\nAgain the apparatus in almost any department used for cooking and\r\nmanufacturing is irregular in its use and an actual record will show\r\nhardly to exceed six hours’ demand or use. Why operate engines and\r\npumps at a disadvantage all the time for the sake of a supply six or\r\neight hours daily? The engine and pump requirement increases rapidly\r\nwith the exhaust steam pressure and requires larger production from the\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\nAny power like that needed for pumping can be transmitted on a wire\r\nwith far less loss than as steam through a pipe.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations then are: Produce electricity as cheaply as\r\npossible; if electricity is made, use high class equipment operating\r\ncondensing and take advantage of superheat if possible; produce\r\nrefrigeration or compress air with the same intelligence; perform all\r\npumping with electrically operated pumps; distribute steam for all uses\r\nat high pressure, at high velocity through small pipes, well insulated\r\nand have the heat at the process when needed; fit boilers so they\r\ncan arise to a demand when needed with ample stack and draft; install\r\nstokers, if the plant will justify it; insulate the boiler walls and\r\ngenerate steam as cheaply as possible--and don’t waste it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Boilers.=--The common types of boilers in the United States are the\r\nfire tube boiler and the water tube boiler. The first named kind is\r\nthat which suggests itself to the reader when a boiler is mentioned\r\nand consists of a shell cylindrical in form with a head in each end\r\ninto which tubes are expanded. In operation the water surrounds the\r\ntubes and the fire passes through them. The water tube boiler is the\r\nopposite of this. There are variations of these and boilers that are\r\nbuilt using both principles in part. There are also Cornish, Lancashire\r\nand Yorkshire types used in England which are fire tubes using only\r\none or two tubes. Where a plant requirement is up to 500 horsepower,\r\nthe fire tube is the usual installation owing to its cheaper cost, and\r\nmore units which enables more continuous operation, especially if a\r\nunit is out of service for cleaning, 100, 125 or 150 horse-power being\r\nthe standard size units. If a plant requires 750 horse-power or more,\r\ninstallation of the water tube is preferable owing to their requiring\r\nless floor space, higher pressures are usually carried and they are\r\nregarded as more safe under these conditions. They can be forced to\r\na higher output if demanded, which is an advantage in times of rush\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Conclusion.=--The mounting costs of fuel prompts the writer to say\r\nthat the management of a power plant of any packing house demands\r\nintelligence in the selection of equipment and in its operation.\r\nThe losses that occur are silently passing on perpetually and are\r\nimmeasurable to the proprietor since they are intangible in dollars and\r\ncents. In these days of educated engineers, a mixture of education and\r\ncommon sense is obtainable and it takes this training or the practical\r\nman who has augmented his practice with ability to use a pencil to\r\nfigure out his conditions, and suggest remedies that will stop a leak\r\nof no inconsiderable consequence. It is a usually neglected department\r\nby the proprietary interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCOOLERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MEAT CHILLING -- DIVIDING BEEF COOLERS -- REGULAR TEMPERATURES --\r\n  MAIN COOLER -- HANDLING BEEF -- FORE-COOLER -- HEAVY CATTLE --\r\n  DOMESTIC BEEF -- TRIMMING OF BEEF -- SKIRT TRIMMING -- RIBBING BEEF\r\n  -- FREEZING BEEF -- LOADING BEEF -- WEIGHING AND TAGGING -- CARE OF\r\n  COOLERS -- MUTTON AND VEAL -- CHILLING HOGS -- CELLARS -- FREEZING\r\n  MEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Meat Chilling.=--Meat chilling must be done intelligently with\r\nopportunity afforded for gradual chilling without too rapid hardening.\r\nThe meat should not be subjected to sudden contracting low temperature\r\neffects, but to a gradual tempering that will carry the meat from blood\r\nheat down to the desired temperature. This effect is readily attained\r\nby properly constructed chill rooms. Air circulation is the great\r\nrequisite.\r\n\r\nSufficient attention has not been paid in the past to provide ample\r\nroom above the hanging carcass, that is space between the carcass and\r\nthe underside of pan loft. Note slope on spray loft in Fig. 17 (Chap.\r\nIV), showing design of Balanced Brine System. Coil lofts should follow\r\nthe same principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dividing Beef Coolers.=--Regarding the subject of dividing beef\r\ncoolers to avoid freshly killed animals from being brought into contact\r\nwith chilled ones. This is a disputed point, but it would seem that\r\nif space were available it would be a benefit to provide for it. Any\r\nmoisture that might be given off from the freshly killed animal would,\r\nupon coming in contact with the chilled one naturally condense, and\r\nmoisture is a detriment to the preservation of meats. The nature of\r\nthe business being conducted and the length of time it might be desired\r\nto store the meat should be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Regular Temperature.=--Temperature is the all important feature\r\nin meat preservation. The best practice appears to be, for beef in\r\ndomestic meat trade, to reduce the temperature to 34° F. as quickly as\r\npossible and endeavor to maintain it at a uniform temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Main Cooler.=--When these rooms are being filled from the fore cooler\r\nthey should be held to a maximum temperature of 38° F. As soon as the\r\nfilling of the cooler is finished the refrigeration should be turned\r\non full force with a view to bringing the temperature down to 34° F.\r\nin twelve to fifteen hours after the cooler is closed. While it might\r\nbe possible to bring it down in much less time it is not advisable;\r\nneither should it be longer than this. At the end of twenty-four hours\r\nfor domestic shipment or city sales, the cooler should be held at a\r\ntemperature of 34° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Handling Beef.=--When the beef is ready to go into coolers it is\r\nsupposedly well dressed and absolutely clean. Such being the case,\r\ncare should be taken to see that the carcasses, as they are moved\r\nalong the rails, are kept bone to bone, or back to back, for if they\r\nare thrown in promiscuously (as more or less blood will run out of the\r\nkidneys if run together, one front against another back of beef) they\r\nwill certainly become discolored. The beef should be handled speedily\r\nand with as little jerking and throwing around as possible, for when\r\nhandled roughly veins will purge more or less and the beef, even though\r\nclean, will be highly colored.\r\n\r\nThe sides of beef should be placed at least a foot apart in the\r\npreliminary or fore-cooler. They should be placed so that under no\r\ncondition does one side of meat touch the other, for if it does touch\r\nit will show an unchilled spot on the beef, which disfigures it.\r\n\r\nBeef should always, if possible, be hung a foot apart the first\r\ntwenty-four hours; later it can be hung closer without detriment,\r\nalthough it should not be allowed to touch.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fore-Cooler.=--When a fore-cooler is used beef should be held in\r\nthe fore-cooler, which consists of one-third of the length of the\r\ncooler cut off by a partition or a separate room, a large amount of\r\nthe moisture and animal heat that is left in the carcass is here\r\nabstracted. When killing choice cattle it is advisable to have the\r\ntemperature of the fore-cooler as near 38° F. as possible, 43° F. is\r\nnot detrimental. Sides of heavy cattle should hang at least eighteen\r\ninches apart in order that the air may circulate freely around the\r\ncarcasses; lighter cattle may be hung closer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Secondary Cooler.=--The room temperature of this secondary cooler can\r\nbe safely reduced to 25° F., before filling. The maximum temperature\r\nshould not rise above 40° F. It is dependent upon the quantity of\r\nproduct placed in the cooler, the excellence of the air circulation,\r\nthe quantity of cooling surface such as sheets, sprays, brine or\r\nammonia pipe and the quantity and temperature of ammonia gas or brine\r\nin use. The possibilities can be ascertained by test and practice\r\nestablished from this. Within twelve hours after killing the beef\r\nshould be in storage reduced to 36°, and further to 33 to 34° F. as\r\nquickly as possible and maintained thereat until the beef is disposed\r\nof.\r\n\r\nMeat which is intended for freezing purposes should be thoroughly\r\nchilled before being sent to the freezers, as it not only aids in the\r\nfreezing of the beef, but it has a much better appearance when it comes\r\nfrom the freezer if it is properly chilled before being frozen.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heavy Cattle.=--These held in the main coolers should be reduced to a\r\nlower temperature. Heavy cattle for domestic trade should be carried\r\nat 32° F. for the first twenty-four hours; after which 34° is not\r\ndetrimental.\r\n\r\nExport cattle for chilled beef shipment should be reduced to a\r\ntemperature of 29° F. as quickly as possible and held there until\r\nloaded in cars or on boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Domestic Beef.=--For domestic beef the coolers should be brought to\r\na temperature of 34° F. in twelve hours after they are filled, not\r\nallowing the temperature to drop below that point. It is true that in\r\nextremely cold weather it can not always be avoided, and oftentimes in\r\ntransit it is lower than that in the cars, but it is not well to permit\r\nbeef to reach that temperature if it can be avoided. If coolers are\r\nproperly handled and have a good circulation, and beef is put in at\r\nthe above temperature and allowed to remain forty-eight to seventy-two\r\nhours, it will be found to be in excellent condition and the chances of\r\n“bone-sour” will be practically eliminated, although it is impossible\r\nto always prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trimming of Beef.=--While this is an item of which little can be said,\r\nit is one which merits consideration where one is doing a large volume\r\nof business. The necks of cattle are trimmed to make them look smooth\r\nand even, cutting off the ragged ends. On large cattle there are two or\r\nthree pounds of brisket fat in each animal. When oleo oil is high and\r\nbeef is low it is advisable to cut this fat out; when the conditions\r\nare reversed it is profitable to leave it in.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Skirt Trimming.=--On export beef it is advisable to trim out part of\r\nthe skirts as usually the skirt in the beef is the first place where\r\nmoisture will accumulate. If the skirt is removed entirely, this\r\naccumulation is prevented, and mould stops.\r\n\r\nThe hanging tenderloin is supposed to be cut out on export beef, and if\r\nthe man cutting it out cuts it from the kidneys, slanting toward the\r\nbackbone, on a hundred cattle he can easily leave in quite an amount\r\nof weight which sells at beef price; if cut out it would be worth only\r\nsausage price.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ribbing Beef.=--If the beef is ribbed properly it shows to the best\r\nadvantage; if improperly ribbed it does not, and the buyer’s opinion\r\nof its value depends largely upon its appearance. Ribbing shows the\r\nquality of the beef to a large extent, hence it is very essential\r\nthat it should be done properly. The secret of ribbing is to follow\r\nclose, without uncovering, the top part of the lower rib on the\r\nplate, following down gradually between the two ribs to the point in\r\nthe backbone where the vertebra is the thinnest, bringing the knife\r\nacross perfectly level. Beef should hang in the proper temperature\r\nfor forty-eight hours before shipment. It should not be ribbed prior\r\nto that unless absolutely necessary, as it has not sufficiently set,\r\nhence the outer layers of beef will slip and give the cut beef a bad\r\nappearance, the object being to show as much meat as possible when the\r\nbeef is ribbed and as little backbone. The exact place to cut probably\r\ndoes not exceed one-half inch wide, hence it will be seen that it\r\nrequires skill to do it rapidly and properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Freezing Beef.=--Beef prepared for freezing should be handled as if\r\nfor chilling or export and at the end of thirty-six hours the coolers\r\nshould be reduced to as low temperature as consistent, until the beef\r\nis transferred to freezing chambers. If a plant is constructed for\r\nfreezing beef it is preferable to set aside and prepare spaces for\r\nfreezing independent of the chill rooms. The freezing temperature\r\nshould be maintained at zero or below, and if the meat is to be\r\nkept for a long time it should be stored in 12° to 15° above zero\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Loading Beef.=--The cars must be properly iced prior to loading and\r\nthe temperature in the cars brought down to the right point. It is\r\ngenerally customary to ice the cars one day before loading, as a car\r\nshould never be loaded that is not 38° F. or lower when the doors are\r\nopened. In the loading, if it is a warm day, the temperature will\r\ncreep up much higher, but the beef coming out of a temperature of 34°\r\nor 35° F. carries a great deal of cold with it, so to speak, and even\r\nthough the cars may be 50° to 60° F. the cold beef, combined with the\r\nrefrigeration from the ice compartments of the car, will bring the\r\ntemperature down rapidly. Cars, of course, should be thoroughly cleaned\r\nand aired out prior to the icing, so that when they are open they are\r\nperfectly clean as well as of the proper temperature. Beef should be\r\nput into the cars as fast as it comes from the coolers, not being\r\nallowed to hang on the rails and be exposed before being placed in the\r\nrefrigerator car. Great care should be used in hanging the beef, that\r\nit is hung perfectly solid and wedged tightly otherwise with the motion\r\nof the car the beef will become chafed and a bone from one quarter of\r\nmeat will mangle and tear the meat on the quarter hanging next to it,\r\noften very seriously injuring its appearance. Fig. 19 illustrates a\r\ntypical beef loading scene at a large American packing plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--LOADING BEEF INTO REFRIGERATOR CARS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Weighing and Tagging.=--In order to watch the business and to know\r\nexactly what each and every purchase realizes it is necessary to keep\r\nan account of each purchase separately, and this is invariably done\r\nin up-to-date establishments. Cattle are killed in lots in which they\r\nare purchased, whether there be one or 500 in the lot; everything in\r\na particular purchase is kept absolutely separate, the weight of the\r\nbeef, hide and tallow separated, and a record sent to the office as\r\nsoon as obtainable. Night clerks usually figure the cost of the beef,\r\nand when the day force comes on in the morning, the actual cost of\r\nall the live stock killed the day previous is before them for their\r\nguidance in the day’s shipments. To do this, as the cattle are dressed,\r\nthe beef is weighed before placing in the cooler. Here the weight of\r\neach individual carcass is taken and tagged, showing the lot to which\r\nit belongs for guidance in shipping, the tag also having the grading\r\nof the particular carcass. Any lot of cattle will run unevenly, or in\r\nother words, there are some that are better than others. As they go to\r\nthe scale an experienced man looks them over and grades them as No.\r\n1, No. 2 or No. 3, considering only this particular lot of cattle, as\r\na No. 2 of one lot may be much better than a No. 1 of another lot;\r\nbut they are graded by taking into consideration the whole of this\r\nparticular bunch of cattle, as purchased. Any cattle that are badly\r\nbruised or damaged or discolored are thrown out and sent to some other\r\ndepartment where they are cut up or treated to the best advantage\r\npossible. As fast as the cattle are graded and tagged they are put into\r\nthe cooler, each special grade on a separate rail, irrespective of the\r\nlot to which it belongs, so that when the shipping clerk gives orders\r\nto the loading gang to have the beef taken out of the coolers, he will\r\norder so many No. 1 cattle off such a rail, lot, etc. As all cattle of\r\nthat particular grade are on this rail it greatly expedites shipping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--VIEW IN BEEF COOLER OF A CHICAGO PACKING\r\nHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nA great deal depends, in the expense of loading as well as the speed\r\nat which it is possible to be done, upon having the beef put into the\r\ncooler in such a way that it comes out readily and without a great deal\r\nof handling and overhauling to get odd cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Care of Coolers.=--It is necessary to keep coolers sweet and clean,\r\nand it is advisable to use a liberal amount of sawdust on the floors,\r\nso that the drippings from the meats may be rapidly absorbed; the\r\nsawdust should be changed bi-weekly or frequently enough to keep the\r\ncoolers in a sweet and cleanly condition. Entrance doors should be\r\nwashed daily, as they accumulate grease and blood, which if allowed to\r\nremain will soon become sour and disagreeable.\r\n\r\nIn all packing house plants where a comparatively large volume of\r\nbusiness is done there should be one man whose sole duty it is to look\r\nafter the refrigerators. This is a matter which necessarily needs\r\nconstant attention and care. When the cooler is filled with warm meat\r\nand the doors are shut it is his duty to increase the refrigeration and\r\nsee that the meat is brought down to the required temperature in the\r\nrequired time. It is apparent that the refrigerators should receive\r\ncareful consideration, and be in charge of a man of reliability.\r\n\r\nBeef should be placed in the cooler immediately after it is killed and\r\nnever allowed to hang outside any longer than necessary. While it may\r\ntake a little more refrigeration to handle it this way than to have it\r\npartially chilled by the outside air, the general appearance of the\r\nbeef will more than repay for the additional cost of refrigeration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mutton and Veal.=--Mutton and veal follow the same general rule as\r\nbeef as to handling. Beef offal of every character should be handled\r\nunder conditions described for export beef. In the handling of any warm\r\nproduct it should all be spaced so as to provide for ample circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chilling Hogs.=--During a summer season and where hogs may have been\r\nhung out for say two hours to air dry, the chill rooms should be\r\nreduced to a temperature of 30° F. at the time the hogs are put in and\r\nsufficient refrigeration applied in to prevent the maximum temperature\r\nexceeding 38° F. It should then be forced sufficiently to again reduce\r\nthe temperature of the chill rooms to 32° F. within twelve hours after\r\nkilling, maintained thus for twenty-four hours additional, then reduced\r\nto 28° F. and maintained at this temperature until hogs are cut out;\r\nforty-eight to seventy-two hours after slaughtering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--VIEW IN HOG CHILLING ROOM OF A LARGE PACKING\r\nHOUSE IN CHICAGO.]\r\n\r\nThe chilling of hogs is handled in a measure the same as cattle, except\r\nthat the hog is a much more difficult animal to chill owing to the\r\ncharacter of the animal. The chilling is of such vital importance that\r\nmost successful meat curers have a set schedule for operation.\r\n\r\nIt is better to segregate the day’s killing in sections of coolers\r\nsixteen to thirty-two feet wide; to insulate each cooler section from\r\nthe adjacent one; to make a filling limit of 40° F. and to require\r\nsufficient refrigeration capacity and facility to reduce the chamber to\r\n32° F. the morning after killing; and to maintain these temperatures\r\nuntil cutting, about forty-eight hours after killing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cellars.=--Dry salt cellars should be carried at a temperature of 38°\r\nF.; sweet pickle meat cellars at 35° F., and for almost any kind of\r\ncuring. Cellars are occasionally reduced to 32° F. to suspend rapidity\r\nof cure. Dry packed meats carry safely for ninety days in 20° F., and\r\nfor longer holding should be reduced to 12° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Freezing Meat.=--The freezing of pork, which has become so important\r\nduring the last decade, seems to produce the best results when\r\nperformed at low temperatures. Many firms maintain freezers at a\r\ntemperature of from 15° to 10° below 0° F. Some insist upon storage\r\nof meats under conditions of 0° F. to 5° F. Unquestionably the prompt\r\nfreezing of the product is a benefit, but the storage in these\r\nexcessively low temperatures would seem questionable since there is a\r\nvery marked “drying” tendency in low temperature rooms owing to the\r\nvery low percentage of moisture the air will contain.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice among some to coat the edges of piles of pork, or\r\nthe individual pieces, with water after the style of dipping fish in\r\nfish-freezing. For all practical purposes, however, it would appear\r\nas well to store the meat in rooms at 7° to 13° F., with 10° as a\r\nstandard. Canvas covering to prevent air circulation is a benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWAREHOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WAREHOUSE DESIGN -- FLOOR AREA -- FIRE PROOF BUILDINGS -- FLOOR\r\n  CONSTRUCTION -- COOLERS -- FAN AND VENTILATION -- SPRAY SYSTEM --\r\n  GALVANIZED SHEET IRON PIPES -- COIL ROOMS -- QUANTITY OF PIPE --\r\n  METHOD OF ERECTING -- LIFE OF PIPE -- CELLAR CEILING SUSPENSION --\r\n  RATIO OF PIPING -- DEFROSTING -- GARDNER CURTAIN SYSTEM -- DIRECT\r\n  EXPANSION PIPING -- CHILL-ROOM BUNKERS -- LOW TEMPERATURE BRINE\r\n  SYSTEM -- FREEZER AND STORAGE BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Warehouse Design.=--Under this heading we will discuss the standard\r\npork building for curing meats and for chilling hogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Floor Area.=--The warehouse building as usually laid out should\r\nprovide 10,000 square feet on each floor, and as many stories in height\r\nas needed and as many units as needed. It is common and usually best\r\nto set posts sixteen feet centers in each direction, making sections\r\nsixteen feet square. This area seems to lend itself best to practical\r\nusage in packing house work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fire-Proof Buildings.=--The permanence of the premises, the value of\r\nthe product in storage, and many other points make the advocacy of\r\nfire-proof warehouses commendable. The warehouse, where floors are\r\nlikely to be used for storing moist or wet goods, or for curing meats,\r\nshould preferably be solid concrete floors, rather than tile, with\r\nconcrete joists and concrete topping.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Floor Construction.=--The ideal packing house floor is as yet to be\r\ndiscovered. What appears to be the best in a warehouse is a monolithic\r\nfloor, treated under the zones where meats are to be piled, and all\r\ntrucking thoroughfares paved with brick or tiles, or perhaps an\r\nasphaltum preparation, as the latter can be replaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coolers.=--In most instances it is best to arrange the coolers on one\r\nor more of the upper floors. Cooler design varies, but late practice\r\nhas been drifting back to the old system of open spray brine which is\r\ndescribed elsewhere. The customary practice in the United States is\r\nfor some type of natural circulation, as by the use of ducts with air\r\nchilling facilities above the chill rooms. Practice has proven for\r\nfresh meats that the use of this system is far superior to that of\r\nforced draft, sometimes called “indirect” refrigeration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fan and Ventilation.=--In northern climates it is a good practice\r\nto place a window at each end of the pipe or brine loft to admit\r\na circulation of air during cold weather, locating an exhaust fan\r\ncentrally over the coolers with a duct connecting with the fan from\r\neach room, drawing air from either end toward the center via the open\r\nwindows in the end of the loft. This induces a circulation through the\r\nhot and cold air ducts which produces quite sufficient circulation and\r\na uniformity of temperature in the contents in the room below.\r\n\r\nIn warm climates the use of roof plugs, and airing or venting the\r\ncooler at each filling, is, in our judgment, an expensive method, and\r\nnot justified by the results obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spray System.=--The “spray system” has been rejuvenated and is very\r\npopular. This system is particularly effective for warm beef and sheep\r\ncoolers and for hog coolers. It can well be installed at slaughter\r\nand shipping points, but its use in hanging rooms where beef is aged\r\nand held for sale is questionable, by reason of the probability of\r\nshrinkage owing to the rapid air circulation maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Width of Rooms._--There are various opinions as to the width and\r\nheight required in a bunker room for installation of the spray\r\nsystem. A room from thirty-two feet to forty-eight feet wide can be\r\nsuccessfully operated. Increased width beyond that means increased\r\nheight and this, in turn, means more construction cost.\r\n\r\nRooms twenty-five feet wide with twenty feet pans have been built and\r\nsuccessfully operated, but at less widths the brine is likely to carry\r\nover. The value of the spray system, and the rapidity with which a\r\nroom and its contents can be cooled by its use, seems to be due to two\r\ncauses, the direct contact of the air with the finely divided brine\r\nspray and the induced air currents created by a mechanical circulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--SECTION OF COLD STORAGE HOUSE EQUIPPED WITH\r\nSPRAY SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Types of Construction._--The accompanying diagrams show two types\r\nof construction. One wherein the brine pan is made of cast concrete\r\nand the rails suspended from wood rail beams hung on rods attached\r\nto the ceiling. The other one shows the brine pan made of wood built\r\nup from supported rail beams. In the first instance the brine spray\r\nis collected on what might be termed a composition roof (without the\r\ngravel covering) made from asphalt saturated paper, and asphalt laid\r\nover a cork sub-base spread upon and cemented to the concrete pan.\r\nIn the second instance the pan is made from wood, exhibiting a wood\r\npaneled surface on the underside, covered with cork, more wood and then\r\nlined with a galvanized iron pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrangement of Piping._--In both instances the brine spray header\r\nwas located near the top of the hot air flue partition and the sprays\r\ndirected to a line below the horizontal, to insure the brine falling\r\nwell within the pan, to prevent splash through the cold air flue.\r\n\r\nThe brine is collected and returned through a main pipe to the brine\r\ntank in which are placed the submerged coils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt Brine--Calcium Brine._--One system is operated on salt brine in\r\nwhich the accumulation is sterilized by boiling, then filtered and used\r\nfor curing purposes. The other is operated on calcium brine which is\r\nconcentrated by passing over a concentrator. It is then returned to the\r\nbrine tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spray Devices._--There are various spray devices purchasable on the\r\nmarket, some approaching atomizers. The owner usually selects something\r\nto his taste. A common spigot can be used with a piece of bent tin to\r\ndistribute the brine at the outlet, but more efficient devices are\r\nobtainable.\r\n\r\nThe location of the nozzles at a distance of about four feet apart\r\nseems to be ample for most purposes. The outlet opening should be about\r\none-half inch, valve controlled to suit. It is well to arrange long\r\nlength of pipe so that each cock is supplied with an equal quantity of\r\nbrine by use of forked connections on a complete supply circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Galvanized Sheet Iron Pipes.=--For room cooling, formerly used to a\r\nconsiderable extent was sheet iron pipes. The three-inch galvanized\r\niron spiral riveted pipe is recommended, or where this is not readily\r\nobtainable three-inch galvanized iron crimp-joint and soldered seam\r\npipe may be substituted. While not quite so substantial as the spiral\r\nriveted pipe, it will, with ordinary care and attention last a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe use of spiral riveted pipe has been found unnecessary, provided\r\nNo. 24 gauge metal is used in lock seamed pipe. Open-hearth steel,\r\ngalvanized, is preferable to Bessemer. The writer experienced one\r\nfailure with the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--SECTION SHOWING BRINE SALT AND SPRAY SYSTEMS.]\r\n\r\nTen different pieces of this pipe ten feet long were capped on either\r\nend and submitted to a hydrostatic pressure test; the bursting pressure\r\naverage of the ten pieces was found to be 146 pounds to the square\r\ninch, while some of the samples stood a pressure of over 180 pounds to\r\nthe square inch. In actual practice the pipe used for this purpose is\r\nnever subjected to a pressure exceeding forty pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coil Rooms.=--Fig. 24 shows the end view of the cooler with the detail\r\nof the hangers on which the pipe rests. Fig. 25 shows the end view of\r\none bay with the pipe located and connected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--END VIEW OF COOLER; DETAIL OF PIPE HANGERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quantity of Pipe.=--In brine pipe refrigeration for cattle the author\r\nwould recommend to each sixteen-foot bay, eight series of three-inch\r\ngalvanized spiral riveted pipes with six pipes in each series. These\r\nmake a total of forty-eight pipes for the fore-cooler, where the\r\nlargest proportion of pipe is needed, and forty pipes per section in\r\nstorage beef cooler. For hog coolers forty-eight pipes per section\r\nthroughout is recommended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--END VIEW OF BAY SHOWING REFRIGERATING PIPE\r\nHUNG TO CEILING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Method of Erecting.=--Adoption of this system where brine circulation\r\nis used can be made for meat storage rooms. (See Fig. 26 for detail\r\nof the end pipes with fittings for the hose connections.) Pipes are\r\nusually furnished in ten-foot lengths, riveted and soldered, and are\r\nslipped together like ordinary stovepipe joint, all of these slip\r\njoints being carefully soldered to be brine tight, a sufficient number\r\njoined together to make runs of the required length to suit the pipe\r\nchamber. At the end of the runs one of the three hose connection\r\nfittings shown in Fig. 26 (feed connection, intermediate connection and\r\nreturn connection) is put on for the purpose of connecting the runs\r\ntogether by means of the rubber hose. Chatterton’s compound is put on\r\nthe nipple of the fitting connection quite warm, the hose being slipped\r\nover at once and a wire clamp then put around the hose very tightly,\r\nwhen the connection is complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--DETAIL OF END PIPES, SHOWING DIFFERENT\r\nFITTINGS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Life of Pipe.=--This pipe is recommended for the following reasons:\r\nFirst, for its economy; second, for its lasting qualities. As proven\r\nby experience, galvanized pipe will last fully twice as long as\r\nthe ordinary black iron pipe. This would hardly seem possible when\r\nfirst considered by anyone not having had the experience, and would\r\nnaturally seem contrary to his judgment. There was installed in 1890\r\nover 100,000 lineal feet of this light galvanized pipe in a Chicago\r\nplant, some of which is still in use.\r\n\r\nSamples of the galvanized pipe that had been in use for upward of ten\r\nyears were found to have a very slight coating or deposit of rust on\r\nthe inside of the pipe, less than one-thirty-second of an inch thick,\r\nand adhering very tightly to the surface. By removing this rust with\r\na sharp instrument it was found that the galvanizing was as clear and\r\nbright as when originally put on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--SIMPLE METHOD OF SUPPORTING BRINE PIPES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cellar Ceiling Suspension.=--In Fig. 27 is shown a very simple,\r\ninexpensive and effective method of supporting brine pipes in cold\r\nstorage rooms, or in rooms used as curing cellars, etc. This arranges a\r\ncombination whereby a drip pan can be suspended for catching the drip,\r\nthe construction being illustrated. It is preferable to line the pans\r\nwith galvanized iron so as to preclude possibilities of leakage. The\r\nwooden construction of the ordinary class is usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ratio of Piping.=--Regarding the quantity of pipe required, this in a\r\nmeasure depends upon the insulation of the cellars and the temperature\r\nof brine circulated. With brine at a temperature of 10° F., one lineal\r\nfoot of pipe will supply radiation sufficient for twenty cubic feet of\r\ncellar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--GARDNER’S “CURTAIN” SYSTEM FOR BRINE\r\nCIRCULATION AS INSTALLED IN A CHICAGO PACKING HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Length of Coil.=--The inlet and outlet pipe should have a 1¹⁄₄-inch\r\nconnection, this being ample for a coil about four hundred feet in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Defrosting.=--To dispose of the accumulation of frost that collects\r\non the coils within the coil bunkers over the beef and hog coolers, it\r\nis usual to have a warm brine arrangement consisting of an independent\r\nfeed header, cross connections to the coils, a tank containing a\r\nheating coil and a small pump.\r\n\r\nWhen the frost collects so as to be detrimental, a supply of brine\r\nin the small storage tank is heated to about 60° F., and it is\r\ncontinuously pumped through the small auxiliary header, thence into\r\nthe coil it is desired to remove the frost from, until the frost is\r\nloosened, when it is lightly tapped and falls to the floor of the\r\nbunker pan. Unless the cellar temperatures are carried low it is\r\nunnecessary to use this system in the curing cellars, as the coils will\r\ndrip from natural melting.\r\n\r\nThe use of this system of brine installation with a proper defrosting\r\narrangement has much to recommend it as to economy and efficiency,\r\nparticularly in use with a balanced brine system.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Later Practice.=--A better system superseding that just described is\r\nto arrange the coil loft or cooler coils with a brine drip over them\r\nto remove the frost, the drip being collected in the pan, conducted to\r\na reservoir and re-circulated. Similar to the manner used with direct\r\nexpansion piping.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gardner Curtain System.=--One of the early types of open brine\r\nchilling was the Gardner curtain system.\r\n\r\nFor this system a refrigerator or curtain room is provided, directly\r\nabove the meat coolers, and of same length and width, in which is fixed\r\nan open pan or brine distributing trough, located over the sheets and\r\ndistributing the brine thereon. Fig. 28 shows a photograph of the\r\ncurtains in a refrigerator or bunker room.\r\n\r\nA plan of installation showing position of curtains is given in Fig.\r\n29, and Fig. 30 shows a cross section of a bunker room with the\r\narrangement and insulation in a wood constructed building.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Direct Expansion Piping.=--There is a decided opinion among many\r\noperators that direct expansion ammonia system piping, is preferable\r\nover any brine circulation system, owing to the non-requirement of\r\npumps for circulating purposes. Caution is necessary in erecting\r\nall direct expansion piping. It must be amply and securely erected,\r\navoiding the use of coach-screws or lag-bolts, owing to the danger of\r\nrotting and giving away, thus causing perhaps fatal injuries. Room\r\npiping will appear best situated when grouped over alleys and arranged\r\nwith drip pans so located as to avoid drip onto meats or packages.\r\nThe ratio of piping given for brine pipe will hold as to lineal feet,\r\nsubstituting foot for foot of two-inch instead of three-inch pipe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--PLAN OF GARDNER “CURTAIN” SYSTEM OF\r\nREFRIGERATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chill-Room Bunkers.=--In chill-room bunkers there should be a brine\r\nsystem arranged to drip the brine over the pipes for use during the\r\nearly hours of filling, since a double advantage can be gained by so\r\ndoing. This is quite effective when intelligently operated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Freezer and Storage Buildings.=--The use of freezer buildings have\r\nbecome of such consequence in larger packing plants for the storage\r\nof meats that it would seem opportune to introduce a description of a\r\nfreezer storage building and to discuss the requirements necessary for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--CROSS SECTION COOLER, BUNKER “CURTAIN” SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Growth._--The growth to include as it now does, in most instances,\r\na produce merchandising business with its seasons of production and\r\nstorage together with the necessity of providing low temperature\r\nstorage space for storing delicately cured hams and bacon over seasons,\r\nmake it almost a necessity to provide low temperature storage or seek\r\nit away from the premises, with the incident expense involved in\r\ntransfer and return, storage charges, and the damage resultant from\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Location._--A first consideration is the location of the building for\r\noperating advantages, which is a local matter, but involves shipping\r\nfacilities by team and by car, convenience to the source of production,\r\nand power plant. Naturally the value of the commodity in storage, which\r\nat present prices, reaches a considerable amount, and the safety of the\r\nproduct becomes a matter of no small thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Permanence._--The permanence of a building for this purpose once\r\nconstructed, and the likelihood of changes due to variation in\r\nbusiness being small, together with the safety of its contents and a\r\nconsequent low insurance rate, makes fire-proof cold storage buildings\r\nhighly desirable. In these days of increasing insurance rates,\r\nbuildings that are rated from twenty to thirty cents per thousand\r\ndollars--non-sprinkled--appeal to us. These rates are not uncommon.\r\nSuch can be obtained on properly constructed buildings with adequate\r\nexposure protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concrete or Steel Frames._--Fire-proof cold storage buildings can be\r\nof various styles of construction. The two types mostly used being,\r\nfirst, of steel frame with either cast iron or steel columns, girders\r\nand beams with tile or concrete in combination for floors, or secondly,\r\nreinforced concrete frame with concrete and tile in combination, or\r\nmonolithic concrete floors.\r\n\r\nFor moderate heights the walls can be self-sustaining, that is, built\r\nup solidly; but beyond a certain height it becomes economical to use\r\ncurtain walls similar to the well known “skyscraper.” In buildings up\r\nto eight stories, reinforced concrete frame with monolithic floors\r\nprove more economical than steel frame with tile or concrete floors.\r\nReinforced concrete buildings are more lasting, since it is impossible\r\nto closely fit tile around steel columns and girders and exclude air,\r\nmoisture, heat and condensation, existing in this class of building,\r\nconditions most contributing to rust. The life of steel framing under\r\nthese conditions is an untried experiment. On the other hand, in the\r\nreinforced concrete building the strength is much derived from the\r\nconcrete and when well designed and the work well executed the steel\r\nis imbedded and thoroughly concealed in the concrete, remote from the\r\nconditions above stated and contributing to an indefinitely long\r\nlife. However, steel columns and girders encased in concrete make them\r\npractically the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limit for Economic Concrete Columns._--Eight-story warehouses with\r\nbasement appear to be ample in height for ordinary conditions. Meeting\r\nthe insistent demands of building ordinances in some cities like\r\nChicago, these can be constructed of reinforced concrete with a maximum\r\ncolumn diameter of twenty-eight inches, with all floors designed for\r\n200 pounds per square foot. This height of building with such loadings\r\napproximates the practical limit of sustaining on footings on the usual\r\nunderlying earth, with building panels sixteen feet square, the column\r\nspacing best adapted to storage purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Types of Construction._--In concrete buildings just referred to, our\r\npreference in style of construction is either of the mushroom type,\r\nthat is, flat ceilings without girders; or secondly, with girders\r\nextending in one direction only. An inexperienced engineer in his\r\nefforts to minimize the quantity of steel and concrete requirement will\r\ninvariably wish to carry girders from column to column and cross beams\r\nbetween girders, making the ceiling look like a checkerboard, losing\r\nperhaps twenty inches or more head room on every story and making a\r\nmuch more expensive building to construct and operate. The same fault\r\nis noticeable in steel frame buildings, since nearly always there are\r\ncross beams between girders. This drops the chilling pipes, curtailing\r\nhead room and makes an unsatisfactory arrangement. Whereas with a\r\nmushroom or flat ceiling with girders in one direction, the difficulty\r\nis overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Space Losses; Beams Two Directions._--In an eight-story building the\r\nadditional height above referred to amounts to from ten to fifteen feet\r\nof unnecessary building and adds greatly to the construction cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Exterior Walls.=--As for the exterior surface of the building, this\r\nshould be brick, the lighter the color the better, making absorption\r\nof heat less probable. When building reinforced concrete frame with\r\ncurtain walls, the design should be such that the brick work entirely\r\ncovers the concrete frame, since it is very difficult to obtain tight\r\njoints abutting beams and columns when attempting to build panels of\r\nbrick in concrete framing. It is desirable to prevent air and moisture\r\nleakage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--GROUND PLAN OF A FREEZER AND STORAGE\r\nBUILDING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Qualities in Brick._--In the selection of brick sufficient attention\r\nis rarely paid to the obtaining of brick burned approximately to\r\nvitrification. The presence of salt, as is frequently noticed on\r\nexterior walls of packing houses adjacent to floor lines, indicates\r\nthat brine has been percolating the walls, due to their porosity.\r\nIn the same manner water will pass through the opposite direction,\r\nand very far disqualify the insulation materials unless they be\r\nnon-absorbing, and even these are lessened in value owing to the\r\naccumulating moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wall Construction._--All kinds of tile and plaster or concrete\r\nexteriors should be avoided, since it is impossible to prevent\r\nshrinkage cracks which permit percolation of water, eventually shelling\r\noff plastered surfaces and deteriorating insulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ventilation._--In northern climates it is desirable to take advantage\r\nof the winter air when it equals or is lower in temperature than\r\nthe rooms where product is stored, or when empty to air and cleanse\r\nan apartment. For convenience in this it is advisable to locate\r\nrefrigerator windows in the same line to permit ready flow through the\r\nroom; these being put on hinges similar to a door.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insulation._--When undertaking to construct buildings fire proof,\r\nproblems in insulation are encountered. The more dense or heavier the\r\nmaterial used in building, the more cold radiated from all surfaces\r\nunless effectually cut off. In ordinary type of construction the\r\nvarious floors rest on exterior walls and in no way is it possible to\r\nprevent a very great loss of cold being carried through the floors,\r\nthence to the walls and dissipated thereby. Such matters are not\r\ntrivial in their importance. At one wholesale distributing market\r\ndeterioration in insulation during six or seven years has necessitated\r\nthe doubling of refrigerating machine service and the volume of\r\nbusiness is practically the same. To obviate this the remedy seems\r\nto be to surround the building on all sides and cover the roof with\r\nan encasing of insulation, putting an exterior covering of brick or\r\nimpervious material over this to protect the insulation, and to\r\nprevent moisture coming in contact with the insulation. It is just like\r\ndropping a small box within a larger one, the space between the sides\r\nbeing the insulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Double Posts or Walls._--This is accomplished when building self\r\nsustaining walls by constructing a set of columns adjacent to the walls\r\nwith girders from column to column and supporting floor slabs upon\r\nthe girders, not permitting either columns, girders or slab to be in\r\ncontact with the exterior wall. In a skeleton construction design there\r\nare twin columns, girders and beams, the inner set carrying the floor\r\nloading and the outer the building walls, the insulation lining being\r\nunbroken between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varying Temperatures._--Commercial demands require a variety of\r\ntemperatures, some at zero, some at fifteen degrees and some at\r\nthirty-two or over, in the one building. The maintaining of these\r\nvarying temperatures in one building requires most careful designing,\r\nsince the concrete everlastingly conveys cold and attempts to cut off a\r\nfloor from that above can only be done by comprehensive and extravagant\r\ninsulating.\r\n\r\nThere have been storage houses where with a freezer situated over or\r\nunder an egg room a stove was maintained in the egg room to offset the\r\ncold temperature from above or below. A dangerous, costly expedient\r\nas well as the risk of freezing eggs. To encase and isolate a room to\r\nmaintain zero to fifteen degrees in it and, say, thirty-two above, it\r\nis necessary to perform the following insulating: Line the ceiling and\r\nbeams; cover the floor; cover the columns, so as to really envelop the\r\ncold. When insulation is placed on the floor, naturally the question\r\nof a wearing surface over the insulation is apparent and to maintain\r\nit fire-proof this must be cement or perhaps mastic. This causes an\r\nexpenditure for wearing surface over the floor insulation, increased\r\ncolumn quantity and strength, increased deadload of floors, insulation\r\nof floor and ceiling, of columns, and this, conservatively speaking,\r\namounts to a total of eighty-five to ninety cents per square foot of\r\narea. This over one foot is but a small amount, but on a building one\r\nhundred feet square it becomes eighty-five hundred dollars per story.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How to Sub-divide._--To meet the variety of temperatures required,\r\nsubdividing the premises into sections, but doing it vertically rather\r\nthan attempt to divide it horizontally, with a portion set aside for\r\neach division of temperature. If the business is of such volume as to\r\npermit this, make no attempt to insulate one floor from that above,\r\nas there is no practical way to do it and obviate an investment in\r\ninsulation from which there is no return. A thorough external wall\r\nand roof insulation is strongly recommended, and the cold radiating\r\ninto a room above that may be only partially filled or empty may be\r\nconsidered as no great loss, provided the outer contacts are eliminated\r\nor minimized.\r\n\r\nIn fire-proof construction the loss of cold through the ground is\r\nan unsolvable problem. To effectually do so it would be required to\r\ninsulate every floor slab, top and bottom, all wall beam and column\r\nsurfaces. From the foregoing deduction the cost would be prohibitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Basement Freezers._--It is obvious from this argument that freezers\r\nshould not be located in basements. It is far better to locate them\r\non the upper floors of the buildings and make the cellar a moderately\r\ncold room, permitting the cold that will to radiate from the columns\r\nto chill it, but supplying such additional piping as may be required\r\nto maintain a regular temperature. If a freezer is placed on a first\r\nfloor, it requires insulating the basement ceiling, which can be\r\nreadily done. The basement columns are not insulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Piping Systems._--With reference to piping for freezing boxed goods\r\nor beef cuts, the shelving system made from coils of pipe upon which\r\nto store the product while freezing is preferable. They are equally\r\nefficacious, whether used in brine circulation or direct expansion\r\nof ammonia. The coils in the freezing rooms are located on ceilings,\r\nmaking one layer over ceiling for fifteen-degree rooms where conditions\r\npermit, for handiness in removing frost. If the rooms be carried at\r\nthirty-two degrees or over, group the coils in alleys to enable easy\r\nlocation of pans for collecting drip, when coils are out of service.\r\nWhether one uses direct refrigerating by expansion of ammonia or brine\r\ncirculation through pipes hung in rooms or indirect refrigerating by\r\ncirculation of chilled air is a matter governed by local conditions and\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF A FREEZER AND STORAGE\r\nROOM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Area and Division._--The plant shown in Figs. 31, 32 and 33 has a\r\nlarge ground area and is a non-sprinkled risk. This building has a\r\nfrontage of 230 feet by 130 feet depth. To avoid an insurance area\r\ncharge for too large floor areas, and because of a desire to carry\r\nseveral temperatures, the building was subdivided into three sections,\r\nA, B and C, by putting in fire walls. It was designed to have Section\r\n“C” subdivided into two halves, permitting the maintenance of two\r\nclasses of low temperature. Section “B” was set aside primarily for\r\ncarrying eggs and apples and thoroughly isolated. Section “A” was\r\ntreated in like manner to Section “C,” except that provision was made\r\nfor the division wall, which was not put in at time of construction.\r\nIllustrating the design is a general floor plan of the premises\r\ntogether with a longitudinal section drawing and a cross section\r\ndrawing of Section “C.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--TRANSVERSE SECTION THROUGH FREEZER SECTION\r\n“C.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Receiving and Discharging._--Referring to the plan, attention is\r\ndrawn to the three sections. Ingress and egress have been provided\r\nby railroad track at one end of Section “A” and double track with\r\nplatforms on each side connected at end. Twin elevators with stairs are\r\nlocated within a continuous vestibule and the center section can be\r\nserved from either elevator and stairs in either vestibule. The corner\r\nstairs in Sections “A” and “B” were demanded by the City Building\r\nDepartment, but not necessary to the operation of the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insulation Lines._--Referring to the longitudinal section observe the\r\ntwin columns, twin girders on each floor level, the inner carrying the\r\nfloor construction and the outer the curtain walls. Notice the inlay\r\nof insulation. The outer walls entirely enclose the concrete skeleton,\r\nmaking the brick work continuous and sightly.\r\n\r\nThe transverse drawing of Section “C” shows a partition continuous from\r\nbasement to ceiling of sixth floor. This partition is not built from\r\nfloor to floor, but continuous through the floors, making either end\r\nvirtually an isolated building.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Warm Storage--One Floor._--It was desirable in this instance to use\r\nthe upper floors of the building for warm storage, consequently the\r\ntop encasing insulation is placed on the ceiling of the sixth story,\r\ncontinuing to and meeting the wall insulation, which with the wall\r\ninsulation encases the cold storage, as spoken of for the ideal. The\r\nfloor construction is of flat ceiling type, there being no girders to\r\ncontend with in piling product or installing piping.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Part Freezers._--Frequently the space required for freezing purposes\r\nwill not be sufficient to justify the construction of an independent\r\nbuilding. Sometimes consideration is given to building freezers in a\r\nhorizontal belt, horizontally across the building. This is not a proper\r\nconstruction, since it costs much more to insulate than if the same\r\nvolume were arranged vertically with one section above the other. In\r\nother words, if one desires to cover a floor surface of 20,000 square\r\nfeet it would be far better to make it four areas of 5,000 feet in a\r\nfour-story building than on one or two floors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSLAUGHTERING CATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RECEIVING LIVE STOCK -- WATERING -- DRIVING CATTLE -- KNOCKING CATTLE\r\n  -- STICKING -- HEADING -- PRITCH STICKS -- FOOT SKINNING -- RIPPING\r\n  AND LEG BREAKING -- FLOORING CATTLE -- BREAST SAWING -- FELL CUTTING\r\n  -- RUMPING -- BEEF SPREADERS -- FELL BEATING -- GUTTING -- BACKING --\r\n  TAIL SAWING -- SPLITTING -- SPLITTING CLEAVERS -- CLEARING OUT AND\r\n  HIDE DROPPING -- NECK SPLITTING -- BRUISE TRIMMING -- SKIRT TRIMMING\r\n  -- WASHING CATTLE -- FOUNTAIN BRUSHES -- DRESSING CATTLE -- CONVEYORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Receiving Live Stock.=--The beginning of the packing business relating\r\nto hogs and cattle starts when they are received in the pens. The pens\r\nin most climates should be paved, provided with proper drainage and\r\nample watering facilities. Before animals are slaughtered the first\r\nessential point is to see they are in condition to be slaughtered,\r\nnamely, that they are not excited, fevered, out of condition, under\r\nfed, or, in other words, that they are as near their normal condition\r\nas possible. Cattle should be allowed to rest over night before they\r\nare slaughtered, if they have been driven or transported any distance;\r\nfor if the animal is tired or excited it will not bleed properly when\r\nslaughtered, and if killed in this condition the meat has a red, fiery\r\nappearance, and is generally unwholesome. It is a condition which the\r\npractical eye of the tradesman will take cognizance of very readily,\r\nand he will not be slow to use it to his advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water and Sprinkling.=--Ample fresh water should be provided for\r\ndrinking purposes, and sprinkling hogs and cattle is very desirable\r\nin hot weather. Fig. 34 is a view of suitable resting pens. After\r\nthe animals have rested a sufficient length of time to be in normal\r\ncondition they should be driven to the killing pens carefully, and\r\nwithout undue violence, such as striking them across the back with\r\nheavy sticks, or prodding them unnecessarily while in the pens, as\r\nthis abuse shows on the meat very readily when the hide is removed.\r\nThis damage is invariably done on the loin and rump of the animal, and\r\nas this is the high-priced part of the meat, it will readily be seen\r\nthat the loss is quite considerable. With stubborn or wild cattle it\r\nis often necessary to be quite severe, but a practiced handler of live\r\nstock will do it in such a manner as to avoid injuring the carcass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--CATTLE RESTING IN PENS BEFORE BEING\r\nSLAUGHTERED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Driving Cattle.=--A wooden knob for the end of a prod pole will\r\nprevent a great deal of bruising and consequent discoloration of\r\nthe meat. When penning cattle from overhead, the penner invariably\r\nprods the animal in the loin, oftentimes using his pole as a harpoon.\r\nThe force of the blow thus inflicted, covering so small a surface,\r\ninvariably makes a bloodshot spot, whereas, if the force of the blow\r\nwere distributed over a portion three times as large no ill effect\r\nwould be noticed, hence the use of the knobs on these poles will do\r\naway with the bruising of loins in handling and penning cattle. Poles\r\nelectrically charged by a wire extending through the pole with a\r\nconnection to the lighting system are used by many with good results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--VIEW ILLUSTRATING MODERN METHOD OF STUNNING\r\nCATTLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Knocking or Stunning Cattle.=--This represents really the first act in\r\nthe slaughtering of cattle. After they have been driven into the narrow\r\npens provided for the purpose, as shown in Fig. 35, the knocker follows\r\nand with a four pound hammer strikes the animal a stunning blow in the\r\nmiddle of the forehead.\r\n\r\nIn former times cattle were speared, which was accomplished by walking\r\nover the top of the runways and with a long, sharp-pointed spear,\r\nsevering the spinal cord. This method of killing, however, is barbarous\r\nand not nearly so efficacious as stunning by knocking, and has been\r\nsuperseded in all the large abattoirs of the United States by the\r\nmethod of knocking as shown in the view. It is advisable to use a\r\nhammer of comparatively large face, so as not to indent the skulls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--STUNNED CATTLE BEING HOISTED FOR STICKER.]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the stunning a sliding door is hoisted and the\r\nstunned animal rolled out to be hoisted for sticking, heading, etc., as\r\nshown in Figs. 36 and 37.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sticking.=--In sticking great care should be taken that the throat\r\nis well opened, thereby giving the blood a free flow, also that in\r\nsticking both arteries and veins are severed, otherwise the beef will\r\npurge on the back and look discolored when finished. Care should also\r\nbe taken not to stick cattle “through,” for if this is done, when the\r\nbullock is thrown on its back, the blood flows onto the chime bones,\r\ncausing a bad discoloration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--HEADING AND SKINNING CATTLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heading.=--Care should be used to see that all the fat possible is\r\nleft on the tongue, leaving it perfectly smooth on the outer surface;\r\nthat as little hide as possible is left around the horns. The header,\r\nin cutting around the side of the head, leaves all the fat on the\r\nheads, and keeps as close to the side of the tongue as he can without\r\ninjury to same; when this is done, the hide dropper can leave a full\r\nshaped neck, otherwise considerable meat which should be on the\r\ncarcass is left on the head, where it is afterward trimmed and only\r\nworth tallow price. In taking the tongue from the head the trimmer\r\nshould cut close to the jaw-bone, so that all the meat possible may be\r\nleft on the tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pritch Sticks.=--For convenience in handling the carcasses on the\r\nbeds, a pritch is used (See Fig. 38). This stick is arranged with a\r\nspike in one end and a ferrule on the other; used to hold the animal\r\nwhen rolled on its back. Pritches were formerly made with spikes at\r\nboth ends. A spike should not be used on the end of the pritch coming\r\nin contact with the beef, as the spike often punctures the hide. The\r\nend of the pritch, which is to rest upon the floor should have a spike\r\ninserted. The end which is to support the carcass, should have a\r\nferrule of 1¹⁄₂-inch pipe, roughened like a saw tooth, which prevents\r\nit from slipping and at the same time does not injure the hide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--PRITCH TO SUPPORT ANIMAL WHEN TURNED ON BACK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Foot Skinning.=--Foot skinning is the term applied to taking off the\r\nfeet. In doing this, cut around the hoofs closely. Do not open the\r\nhide any higher than necessary to unjoint the feet. If the shank is\r\nuncovered more than necessary, it is likely to become dirty, and it is\r\nimpossible to make it clean if the tissue becomes stained. Be careful\r\nto see that none of the cords from the front part of the shin-bone are\r\nleft on the hide. The men skinning the front feet usually raise the\r\ngullet. In doing this they should be careful to open the neck straight\r\nfrom where the sticker left off, and guard against cutting the weasand.\r\nThe gullet should not be raised too high with the knife when clearing,\r\nfor if this is done, it allows the blood to run back on the ribs,\r\nproducing the same effect as if the bullock had been stuck through.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ripping and Leg Breaking.=--In this operation care should be exercised\r\nto see that the first cut is made exactly where the sticker left off,\r\nopening the breast and hide in the center the full length of the\r\nanimal, in a straight line. Uncover the gam only sufficient to reach\r\nthe joint, leaving the hide over balance of shank to protect it. In\r\nthis way you get very much better shanks than if skinned too low. Cut\r\nclosely to hoofs so all hide possible comes off around the feet, but\r\nthat none of the cords are left on the hide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--VIEW SHOWING DOUBLE-BED KILLING FLOOR IN A\r\nMODERN SLAUGHTER HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Flooring Cattle.=--This expression describes rimming over and siding\r\nthe bullock. The special object of this operation is to attain a smooth\r\nhide without scores or cuts, smooth work on the bullock, which consists\r\nin saving the fell very carefully, clearing the rose on shoulder fully,\r\nalso the saving of the fell back of the elbow and the forward shoulder.\r\nThe latter part is a very particular point, as if the fell is not left\r\nit shows black upon chilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Breast Sawing.=--In sawing the breast, it should be done centrally,\r\nholding saw at same angle as that at which the animal is lying,\r\notherwise the saw works toward one side, and makes a very bad-looking\r\nbrisket on one side of the beef. Saw where marked, otherwise it will\r\nbecome necessary to trim meat from the neck, if the marks have not been\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nCaul pulling consists in taking out the caul in a tidy, cleanly\r\ncondition, keeping same off the floor, and putting it into a box. Care\r\nshould also be taken not to cut or tear the intestines, and if so, that\r\nthey are immediately skewered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fell Cutting.=--Fell cutting consists in skinning the hide off the\r\nhind legs when animal is on the first hoist. The points to be carefully\r\nlooked after in this work is to see that smooth work is done both on\r\nthe hides and on the beef itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rumping.=--This operation requires very skillful work, and calls for a\r\ngreat deal of attention. Points to be attained are a smooth hide free\r\nfrom scores or cuts, and smooth work on the beef. Care must be used\r\nin this work to see that the rumper keeps very close to the hide on\r\noutside of the leg, in order that the fell-beater may do good work. If\r\nthe rumper is careless and breaks through the fell, it is impossible\r\nto carry this down smoothly. In working around the tail, care must be\r\ntaken not to cut into the lean meat, especially on thin cattle, where\r\nthere is comparatively little covering.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fell Beating.=--If the floorman and rumper do their work properly,\r\nit is comparatively easy to do a good job at fell beating. The\r\nfell-beaters should then use care to see that they do not tear\r\nthrough, and, in marking with the chopper, to mark in such a way that\r\nthey tear back instead of cutting off.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gutting.=--The objects sought for in this particular work are: First,\r\ncleanliness, and next, to save the fat smooth and without tearing\r\nit around the bones. The liver should be taken out without tearing.\r\nSpecial care should be used in cutting between kidneys, to open in the\r\ncenter without cutting tenderloin. Also to leave all tenderloin in\r\nthe bullock, for, if any comes out with the “pluck” it is wasted. The\r\nworkmen should also be careful about cutting intestines or weasands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--ORDINARY BEEF SPREADER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Backing.=--The objects to be attained in this particular work, are:\r\nFirst, smooth hides, free from scores or cuts, at the same time leaving\r\nno fat on the hide, and next, particular care should be taken in the\r\nwork required in the dropping of the hide to see that the fat is not\r\nremoved from the loins.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tail Sawing.=--The point in this work is to see that the saw is\r\nabsolutely in the center, and that the first bone is sawed centrally.\r\nBetter work can doubtless be done by sawing the tail from the rear,\r\n“popping” it twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Spreaders.=--In slaughtering cattle it was formerly the custom\r\nto use an ordinary spreader as shown in Fig. 40, which spread all\r\ncarcasses, large or small, a certain distance and kept them spread\r\nfrom the time they were hung until finished splitting. The spring beef\r\nspreader illustrated in Fig. 41, is a great improvement over this old\r\nspreader. When the cattle are first hung on this appliance the center\r\npiece is raised up, allowing the hooks to hang in a normal condition\r\nproportionate to the size of the animal which is hung on them. Hanging\r\nin this shape, the rumper is given a chance to do his work better.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Splitting.=--Great care should be exercised in this particular work,\r\nespecially on “hard-bone” cattle. They should split the bone down\r\ncentrally, the entire length of the carcass. Great care should be taken\r\nto see that they split the short fin-bone in the neck, thereby giving\r\nthe neck-splitter a chance to start centrally with his work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--SPRING BEEF SPREADER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Splitting Cleavers.=--Care should be exercised to see that these\r\nare in the very best condition to do the work. They should be ground\r\nas thin as possible, yet not so thin that they will shatter. If the\r\nsplitters do not break a chopper occasionally, it is evidence that\r\nthese are not ground as thin as they should be, and, unless they are,\r\nit is impossible to do good work in splitting. The workmen should,\r\nhowever, have choppers ground different thicknesses for different\r\nboned cattle, and never use thin-ground choppers on cows or hard-boned\r\nsteers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--VIEW SHOWING BEEF CARCASSES BEING SPLIT AND\r\nHUNG ON TROLLEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Clearing Out and Hide Dropping.=--In clearing the shanks the workmen\r\nshould look carefully to see that they do not score the hide, or make\r\nany miscuts in the meat. They should also save the veins in the under\r\nside of forward shoulder, for when these are cut they continue to\r\npurge, making bad-looking shanks. In hide dropping care should be used\r\nto see that the workmen do not score or cut hides, make miscuts in the\r\nneck, or leave any unnecessary fat on the hide. They should also skin\r\nhides as low down as possible on the necks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Neck Splitting.=--This should be done carefully, splitting the\r\nneck fairly in the center. The last bone, or “deacon” joint, in the\r\nneck should be broken centrally, in order to give equal weights and\r\nappearance to the beef.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bruise Trimming.=--This is a very essential feature in the dressing\r\nof cattle, and one in which good judgment must be exercised. It is,\r\ntherefore, very hard to lay down any set rules further than the\r\nfollowing: The object of trimming bruises is to take off all blood\r\naccumulations, and at the same time leave all the fat possible on the\r\nhips, etc., to be bleached out by using hot water and thorough wiping.\r\nThe great danger, generally speaking, is that they are trimmed too much\r\nand scrubbed too little. These are points which require very careful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Skirt Trimming.=--Skirt trimming consists in cutting off the edge of\r\nthe skirts evenly on native cattle without exposing the lean meat. On\r\nwestern cattle and thin stock, the skirts should be trimmed high enough\r\nso that they will expose the lean meat, which gives a chance for all\r\nmoisture which has gathered under the film to escape, making the beef\r\ndryer than if otherwise trimmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Washing Cattle.=--It will be noted that the carcasses are then\r\nseparated into two pieces and should be thoroughly washed and scrubbed\r\nwith fountain brushes to insure absolute cleanliness in every part. The\r\nwashing and wiping should be carefully performed, and incidental to the\r\nwashing is the scraping of slime from the back and shoulders previous\r\nto wiping. Many slaughter floors are now equipped with centrifugal\r\nwringers for wringing out boiled cloths and cleanliness is made\r\nparamount in handling beef.\r\n\r\nIn the washing of beef the work should start at the hind legs, the\r\nstep-ladder men being the first to use water on the beef after it is\r\nsplit. Next, the back washers and wipers; after these, the neck and\r\nrib washers, the policy being to start at the top and clean the beef as\r\nthey go along. The washers should be kept close up, handling the beef\r\npromptly, running it into the cooler as fast as it is dressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fountain Brushes.=--A convenient apparatus for washing carcasses is\r\nthe fountain brush. It consists of an ordinary brush with a spray\r\nattachment on the front of it, as shown in Fig. 43. To this is attached\r\na hose which supplies hot water from the vat above. When the men are\r\nready to scrub the beef a valve is turned on, the water gravitating\r\nthrough the hose to the meat. In wetting it continuously the blood or\r\ndiscoloration which may be gathered on the meat is rapidly taken off,\r\nleaving it in a bright, clean condition. The beef is then wiped with\r\na cloth made of ten or twelve thicknesses of very coarse cheese cloth\r\nwhich rapidly absorbs the moisture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--THE FOUNTAIN BRUSH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dressing Cattle.=--The mechanical labor of dressing cattle is about\r\nthe same whether slaughtering ten or ten hundred, except in the former\r\ncase the work would be performed by one man and in the latter by\r\nprobably one hundred and thirty. The facilities for doing the work\r\nvary with the quantity and style of beds. Some beds are burdened\r\nwith mechanical appliances where the apparatus more than counteracts\r\nany possible labor saving that can be effected. Common sense in this\r\ninstance would indicate simplicity, as conveyors and mechanical\r\nappliances are costly for installation and for upkeep.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dressing Conveyors.=--Dressing conveyors to take the animal after\r\nsiding would, however, appear advantageous, since it permits of the\r\nconcentration of the viscera for inspection and manipulation, and makes\r\nfor facilities where the same can be handled to meet the regulations\r\nand avoid the troubles of food products touching the floor on being\r\ntrucked. These conveyor systems can be simple or complicated and each\r\nhouse requires treatment comparable with the quantity of business\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe type of killing beds, where the pens range across the building\r\nwith one pen for each two beds, and a waiting pen where the drive can\r\nbe moved forward for knocking, is, in the writer’s opinion, the least\r\ncostly for standard operation, particularly if an automatic hanging-off\r\narrangement is provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDRESSING YIELDS AND CATTLE CUTTINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  YIELDS OF CATTLE -- YIELD FROM TWENTY-TWO NATIVE CATTLE -- YIELD FROM\r\n  FIFTY-NINE TEXAS CATTLE -- YIELD FROM TWENTY HEAVY CATTLE -- YIELD\r\n  FROM THIRTY-FOUR CATTLE -- PERCENTAGE OF VARIOUS CUTS -- BEEF CUTS --\r\n  DIAGRAM OF CUTTING -- GRADING -- LOINS -- RIBS -- ROUNDS -- CHUCKS --\r\n  PLATES, SHANKS AND FLANKS -- BARRELED BEEF.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yields of Cattle.=--The following are carefully prepared calculations\r\nmade from data obtained in operation, showing yields of different\r\nproducts on several different lots of cattle. These were choice\r\ncattle in each instance and the average yield of the products is\r\ngenerally larger than would be the case with the ordinary run of cattle\r\nslaughtered. A perusal of the different tests given in the following\r\npages will give the reader the average yield in different lines from\r\nthe cattle handled, together with the value of the different items at\r\ntime tests were made.\r\n\r\nThe prices were in vogue at the time of the original publication and\r\nwhile now obsolete are left for comparative purposes.

Hall. This is so clearly\r\nexpressed and well illustrated that nothing need be added to the\r\nsubject. The same is true regarding data shown on mutton and on hogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Cuts.=--“Wholesale fresh beef” trade is about equally divided\r\nbetween carcass beef and beef cuts. The latter are sold both as\r\n“straight cuts” and as subdivisions thereof. The “straight cuts”\r\nhandled in Chicago markets are Loins, Ribs, Rounds, Chucks, Plates,\r\nFlanks and Shanks (Fig. 44). The loin is separated from the round at\r\nthe hip joint. The flank is cut from about the middle of the thirteenth\r\nrib to the opposite lower corner of the loin. The shank is sawed off\r\njust below the second knuckle (shoulder joint). The plate is cut off on\r\na line extending from about the middle of the twelfth rib through the\r\npoint at which the shank is removed. The rib and chuck are separated\r\nbetween the fifth and sixth ribs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--CHICAGO BEEF CUTS.\r\n\r\n  1, 2, 3.              Round\r\n  4, 5, 6.

Cuts\r\nthat are too deficient in thickness and quality to be used on the\r\nbutcher’s block, and which are consequently made into boneless cuts,\r\nbarreled beef, sausage, etc., are termed “strippers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diagram of Cutting.=--The page illustrating a diagram of cutting shows\r\nthe “Chicago” method of dividing the animal if cut for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grading.=--“Weight affects the grade of a beef cut about the same as\r\nin grading a carcass. No. 1 cuts are principally from choice and prime\r\n800 to 1,000-pound native steer carcasses and choice 750 to 900-pound\r\nnative cows; No. 2’s are largely from medium and good 650 to 800-pound\r\nsteers and 600 to 750-pound cows; and No. 3’s are made chiefly from 450\r\nto 600-pound common and medium cows, also from Texas and light Western\r\nsteers. Stripper cuts are made from canners, medium and common bulls,\r\nTexas and common light Western cattle.\r\n\r\nAVERAGE WEIGHTS OF STRAIGHT BEEF CUTS (POUNDS)\r\n\r\n  Grade     Loins  Ribs Rounds Chucks Plates Flanks Shanks\r\n  No. 1     50-85 30-50 75-110 75-110  40-80  15-20  10-20\r\n  No. 2     40-60 25-35 60-80  60-80   30-50  10-15   5-10\r\n  No. 3     25-40 20-25 40-60  40-60   20-35   5-10   5-10\r\n  Strippers 20-30 15-20 30-40  30-40   15-20   5-10   5-10\r\n\r\n\r\n=Loins.=--“The loin is the highest-priced cut of the carcass because\r\nof the tenderness and quality of the lean. The grade of a loin may be\r\ndetermined by marked excellence or deficiency in either thickness,\r\ncovering or quality, or by a uniform degree of development in all\r\nrespects. _No. 1’s_ must have a full, well-rounded shape, a complete\r\ncovering of white fat, the thickness of which is in proper proportion\r\nto the lean, and bright, firm, fine-grained, well-marbled flesh. _No.\r\n2’s_ are generally less rounded in form, with insufficient, excessive,\r\nor uneven covering and a slight deficiency in grain, marbling or color\r\nof flesh; while _No. 3’s_ are more flat in shape, nearly or entirely\r\nlacking in covering of fat and very deficient in thickness and quality\r\nof flesh, but sufficiently developed to be cut into porterhouse and\r\nsirloin steaks for cheap trade (Fig. 45). Stripper loins have no\r\noutside fat and are usually extremely flat and rough in shape, with\r\ndark-colored, coarse-grained flesh, and hard, white bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--A.

BELOW, SIDE VIEW.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ribs.=--“This cut, which includes the portion between the loin and\r\nchuck, contains the best roasts. The poorer quality of ribs are boned\r\nand make ‘the roll.’ A ‘regular roll’ consists of the lean part of the\r\nrib with backbone removed and shoulder blade fat cut away. ‘Spencer’\r\nrolls are of the same type, except that the covering is left on the\r\nlean, exclusive of that over blade bone, which is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rounds.=--“The cut surface of the full round is identical with the\r\nbutt end of the corresponding loin. Cuts of various types of rounds are\r\nshown in Fig. 47. An excess of rounds under average conditions makes it\r\nnecessary to divide the rounds further into rump butts used for corn\r\nbeef; beef hams used for dried beef, and shanks for sausage meat.\r\n\r\n“In stripping a bullock for beef hams, it is divided into three parts,\r\nknown as a set, viz., inside, outside, and knuckle pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chucks.=--“The style of cutting shown in Fig. 48 is known as the\r\nsquare chuck, and is the style most used in Chicago wholesale markets.\r\nChucks are sometimes cut ‘knuckle out’ by removing the shank with a\r\nknife at the second knuckle instead of sawing off below the joint. The\r\nlower grades of chucks are often further divided in order to make the\r\ncut more saleable. Such cuts are the shoulder clod and boneless chuck.\r\nThe shoulder clod is a wedge-shaped piece cut from the fleshy part of\r\nthe chuck just back of the shoulder blade, and extending from the elbow\r\nof the shank nearly or quite to the backbone. It is taken mainly from\r\n_No. 3_ and ‘stripper’ cuts, and to a small extent from _No. 1’s_ and\r\n_2’s_. It is a boneless cut weighing six to fifteen pounds, and sells\r\nfrom 10 to 20 per cent above chuck quotations.”\r\n\r\nA “kosher” chuck consists of the square chuck, shank, brisket and neck\r\nin one piece, the forequarter with rib and navel piece off.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plates, Shanks, and Flanks.=--“These are usually boned and the parts\r\nused in sausage department and bonehouse, except in the heavier cuts of\r\nplates and flanks, which are used in mess beef.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Barreled Beef.=--“The demand for barreled beef is a receding item in\r\npacking house usage. Formerly it was a large item. The quotation gives\r\nthe grading and naming:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--A, BEEF HAMS (LEFT, “INSIDE”; CENTER,\r\n“OUTSIDE”; RIGHT, “KNUCKLE”). B, TENDERLOIN. C, SHOULDER CLOD.]\r\n\r\n“_Extra India Mess Beef_ is made from heavy fat _No. 1_ plates weighing\r\n65 to 80 pounds, cut into pieces of about eight pounds average and\r\npacked in tierces or barrels. It is the highest grade of barreled beef\r\nand is sold largely through British markets for army and navy use.\r\nFulton Market Beef is of the same quality as Extra India, but from 60\r\nto 70 pound plates, and is usually put up in half barrels or tubs for\r\ndomestic trade. These and the two following grades of plate beef are\r\nusually packed with the lower side of the brisket piece removed.\r\n\r\n“_Extra Plate (Extra Family) Beef_ is cut from moderately fat _No. 1_\r\nplates (50 to 60 pounds), and packed like Extra India. It is exported\r\nprincipally to various countries in northern Europe.\r\n\r\n“_Regular Plate or Family Beef_ consists of _No. 2_ plates (40 to 50\r\npounds), with a good proportion of fat and lean, cut into pieces of six\r\nto eight pounds and packed the same as Extra India. It is also sold\r\nlargely in northern European countries.\r\n\r\n“_Packet Beef_ is made from 30 to 40-pound plates (heavy _No. 3’s_ and\r\nlight _No. 2’s_) cut the same as other grades of plate beef. It is\r\nused throughout Europe, the West Indies, Central and South America.\r\n\r\n“_Common Plate Beef_ is made from _No. 3_ plates, 20 to 30 pounds\r\naverage, cut and packed as explained above. It is the lowest grade or\r\nbarreled plate beef. This grade, also Prime Mess and Extra Mess Beef,\r\nis sold to the same trade as Packet Beef.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--SHANKS. NO. 1 GRADE, NO. 2 GRADE, NO. 3 GRADE.\r\nCLOD ON.]\r\n\r\n“_Rolled Boneless Beef_ (Rolled Beef or Rollettes) consists of plates\r\nwith a portion of the brisket cut off, the remainder of plate being\r\nboned, rolled and wound with twine. It is made from _No. 2_ and _No.\r\n3_ plates of 25 to 40 pounds average. The rolls weigh eight to twelve\r\npounds and are cured in mild brine.\r\n\r\n“_Prime Mess Beef_ consists of about 100 pounds of plates and 100\r\npounds of chucks, rumps and flanks per barrel cut into pieces of six to\r\nnine pounds. The proportions of the cuts named are varied according to\r\ndemands and may contain 100 pounds of chucks with the remainder plates,\r\nflanks and rumps, or as otherwise specified. This grade is made from\r\nheavy _No. 3_ and light _No. 2_ cuts.\r\n\r\n“_Extra Mess Beef_ contains the same assortment of cuts as Prime Mess,\r\nbut is made only from _No. 3_ cuts.\r\n\r\n“_Ramp Butt Beef_ is cut from rumps off the medium and lower grades\r\nof rounds, and is boneless except a small piece of tail-bone. The\r\npieces average four to six pounds each. It is sold largely in lumbering\r\ndistricts and to the fisheries trade.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHIDES AND PELTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GREEN HIDES -- CONDITION -- SCORES -- PROD POLE DAMAGE -- CLEAN\r\n  FLOORS -- LEATHER YIELDS -- PATTERN -- PROPER STORAGE FOR HIDES --\r\n  GRADING -- GRUBS IN HIDES -- SALT TO BE USED -- BUILDING OF PACKS OF\r\n  HIDES -- TRIMMING OF GREEN HIDES -- SWITCHES -- SHRINKAGE OF HIDES --\r\n  SHEEP PELTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Green Hides.=--Next in value to the beef is the hide and the handling,\r\ncuring, etc., of this particular part of the animal, until it is ready\r\nto be delivered requires careful attention to obtain the best results.\r\nFor convenience in handling green hides a special hide truck, shown in\r\nFig. 51, is usually employed. The platform of the truck is 3¹⁄₂ × 5¹⁄₂\r\nfeet, with a 1¹⁄₄ inch hardwood plank eight inches high on one side and\r\non front end. The wheels are about eighteen inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--HIDE TRUCK FOR CARTING BEEF HIDES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Condition.=--The first consideration, of course, is the condition of\r\nthe hide. There has been marked improvement in recent years in the\r\nhandling of hides. Formerly, where unskilled workmen were killing only\r\na few cattle daily, or weekly, they did not become proficient in the\r\nremoval of hides and the hide was more or less damaged by scores and\r\ncuts. When cattle are killed in large numbers it is necessary to make\r\na division of labor, and instead of one man doing many parts of the\r\nwork, he simply does one part continuously, and hence becomes very\r\nskillful; the “take-off” of the hide, particularly, is improved. That\r\nthis condition is appreciated by tanners is evidenced by the difference\r\nin price paid for country and packers hides; the tanners paying from\r\n³⁄₄c to 1c more per pound for packers hides because the hide has been\r\nproperly taken off, while a country hide, which is usually taken off\r\nby workmen less skilled has been cut and scored, the scores being\r\nparticularly objectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scores.=--A score in a hide is made by cutting into it when removing,\r\nfar enough to damage the grain of the leather, and when it comes from\r\nthe tannery, scores show very plainly and in many cases one-half of\r\nthe thickness of the leather is lost by this defect. Hides taken off\r\nproperly, should not show these imperfections, in fact, should be as\r\nsmooth as though slipped off the animal, were that possible, instead\r\nof by a knife, and with skilled workmanship such is the case. One\r\nman doing one particular operation continuously, the “take-off” of\r\nhides has been so improved that less than ten hides out of a thousand\r\nare found to be “No. 2” quality when taken out of the cellar in a\r\nwell-regulated house.\r\n\r\nThe “take-off” of the hides particularly should be watched by the\r\nkilling foreman and the workmen’s attention drawn to the slightest\r\ndefects continuously, as much depends upon the reputation a house\r\nmay have for its take-off. Many of the small scores which are found\r\nto materially damage the hide when tanned are invisible when the\r\nhide is taken out of the packer’s cellar, as owing to discoloration,\r\nsalt, etc., it is impossible to see many of them, but they are all\r\nvisible when the leather is turned out. Consequently, if a house has\r\na reputation for bad “take-off,” buyers usually aim to buy the hides\r\nfrom a plant with a good take-off. Hence it will be seen that in this\r\nparticular department it means a great deal to have a good reputation\r\nfor “take-off.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--DIAGRAM OF HIDES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Prod Pole Damage--Clean Floors.=--Outside of the “take-off” there are\r\nseveral other points which should be watched carefully on the killing\r\nfloor in the handling of this particular article. The hides should not\r\nbe damaged with prod poles by the men handling cattle in the pens. The\r\nfloors should be kept as clean as possible, especially where the cattle\r\nare thrown out of the knocking pens, as blood is very objectionable\r\non the hides. It is liable to cause decomposition when the hide is in\r\npack, and if it does sufficiently for the hair to slip on the hides,\r\nit becomes a “No. 2.” Another bad feature is that a bloody hide will\r\ndiscolor the flesh side of the skin next to it in pack, and it is\r\nalways advisable to get the hides out as bright and clean as possible,\r\nas buyers prefer them so.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why they should be kept as dry as possible is that\r\nthe hides are weighed as taken off for general record and also for\r\nestimating the cost of the beef. If the hides are allowed to get wet\r\nthey will absorb four or five pounds per hide, which if deducted from\r\nthe calculations, will represent a false credit of 40c or 50c per\r\nhead on the cattle. It is best to keep them as dry as possible, so\r\nthat weights used for figuring and record purposes may be accurate.\r\nIf the hides go into the packs excessively wet, when shipped, they\r\nwill necessarily show an excess shrinkage from green to cured weights,\r\ncausing confusion as to actual shrinkage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leather Yields.=--While it is advisable to have hides carry as much\r\nmoisture as is acceptable to the buyer, it is not profitable to\r\nhave them too wet, as the buyers watch such matters and if a lot of\r\nhides from a certain house do not show the yield in leather which\r\nthey should, purchases made after that from such a house are made\r\nproportionate to the yield, hence the additional weight that may be\r\ngained is more than lost in the price realized. There is a happy medium\r\nto be sought in this matter where the seller gets all that he is\r\nentitled to and the buyer is satisfied with the yield he obtains.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pattern.=--The diagram, Fig. 52, shows the pattern of a packing house\r\nhide and, as nearly as can be indicated on paper, it shows the part\r\nremoved by each workman.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Proper Storage for Hides.=--This is a point usually not given due\r\nconsideration, some packers reasoning that as long as their hides are\r\nin a building, little else is to be considered. The following figures\r\nwhich are accurate, will give the reader an idea of the loss that lack\r\nof attention in this particular matter may represent. It will be noted\r\nthat the test extends over a period of one year, representing a test on\r\na total of 198,341 hides.\r\n\r\nA total of 87,587 hides were cured in house _No. 1_, which consists\r\nof a cellar under refrigerated rooms. While no attempt was made to\r\nrefrigerate this room there was a natural radiation to the floor above\r\nwhich held the temperature at from 55° to 60° F. in hot weather. There\r\nwere but two openings in the cellar and naturally little circulation\r\nof air, hence the moisture of the cellar was retained and the hides\r\nshow a shrinkage of 14.74 per cent from the green weight on bed to\r\nshipping weight.\r\n\r\nSHRINKAGE OF HIDES FOR YEAR ENDING AUG. 1, 1903, IN HOUSE NO. 1.\r\n\r\n  =================+======+=========+=========+=========+=======\r\n                   |      |         |         |         |Shrink-\r\n                   |      |         |         | Shrink- |  age,\r\n                   |      |  Green  |  Cured  |   age,  |  per\r\n       Kind        |Number|  weight |  weight |   lbs.  |  cent\r\n  -----------------+------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  Free of brands   |41,870|3,328,133|2,842,542|  485,591| 15.59\r\n  Butt brands      | 6,087|  507,684|  432,722|   74,962| 14.77\r\n  Side brands      |13,190|1,078,959|  927,835|  151,124| 14.06\r\n  Spreadies        | 2,376|  215,676|  190,286|   25,390| 11.79\r\n  Texas            |11,285|  871,573|  731,165|  140,408| 16.11\r\n  H’y native cows  | 8,029|  592,338|  500,935|   91,403| 15.43\r\n  Light native cows| 2,759|  150,995|  127,108|   23,887| 15.82\r\n  Branded cows     | 1,991|  128,269|  107,563|   20,706| 16.14\r\n  -----------------+------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n    Totals         |87,587|6,873,627|5,860,156|1,013,471| 14.74\r\n  -----------------+------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n\r\nSHRINKAGE OF HIDES FOR YEAR ENDING AUG. 1, 1903, IN HOUSE NO. 2.\r\n\r\n  ===============+=======+=========+=========+=========+=======\r\n                 |       |         |         |         |Shrink-\r\n                 |       |         |         | Shrink- |  age,\r\n                 |       |  Green  |  Cured  |   age,  |  per\r\n       Kind      | Number|  weight |  weight |   lbs.  |  cent\r\n  ---------------+-------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  Free of brands | 34,192|2,692,615|2,262,426|  430,189| 15.98\r\n  Butt brands    | 14,279|1,174,093|  977,943|  196,150| 16.71\r\n  Side brands    | 17,302|1,451,850|1,198,925|  252,925| 17.42\r\n  Spreadies      |  3,969|  363,233|  307,410|   55,823| 15.37\r\n  Native bulls   |  1,362|  127,910|  103,263|   24,627| 19.27\r\n  Branded bulls  |    252|   25,885|   21,761|    4,124| 15.93\r\n  H’y native cows|  8,222|  576,313|  472,938|  103,375| 17.94\r\n  Texas          |  5,247|  395,620|  324,100|   71,520| 18.08\r\n  L’t native cows| 14,895|  841,481|  709,181|  132,300| 15.72\r\n  Branded cows   | 11,034|  694,503|  574,669|  119,834| 17.25\r\n  ---------------+-------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n      Totals     |110,754|8,343,503|6,952,616|1,390,867| 16.67\r\n  ---------------+-------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n\r\nA total of 110,754 of these hides were cured in house _No. 2_. This\r\nwas on the first floor of the building and no refrigeration was used\r\nin any of the departments. There were several openings into this\r\nroom, permitting the outside air to circulate through the building\r\nand a great deal of moisture naturally absorbed. It will be noted by\r\ncomparing the reports that the shrinkage in this cellar was 16.67 per\r\ncent from the green weight to the shipping weight, showing an excess\r\nof 1.83 per cent, which would show a loss of 154,686 pounds. This,\r\nat an average of 10c per pound, would indicate a loss of $15,468.60\r\nsustained by having this number of hides in this particular cellar, as\r\nagainst what would have been realized had they shown no more shrinkage\r\nthan those in house _No. 1_, so that it will readily be seen that it is\r\nof vital importance to the owner to see that the hides are stored in\r\nsuitable storage, that there is as little circulation as possible of\r\noutside air through this department, and that all doors and openings\r\nare kept closed as much as possible. This is paramount, in case hides\r\nare sold, seller’s weights, at works. On long shipments involving many\r\ntransfers and exposures, the matter is not of such consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grading.=--This is a question which must be governed largely by the\r\nlocal conditions. Many small killers find it profitable to sell their\r\nhides without selections, rather than to try to make the different\r\nselections with a comparatively limited number to select from, whereas,\r\nwhere cattle are killed in large numbers it is advisable to make just\r\nas many selections as is profitable, being governed, of course, at all\r\ntimes by the market quotations and demands. The usual grades of hides\r\nare termed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natives._--Native steer hides are hides from native steers which\r\nare free of brands. Another selection of natives is what is called\r\n“spreadies,” which are hides taken from native cattle free of brands,\r\ncuts, scores, or grubs and must be six feet four inches wide at the\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Texas._--This is the term used to designate all hides taken off\r\nsouthern cattle where the hide is very thick and heavy. Brands are not\r\ntaken into consideration on these selections.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Butt Brands._--These are either natives or western hides which are\r\nbranded on the butts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colorados._--These are hides from the western cattle, which are too\r\nthin for Texas and are branded on the sides.\r\n\r\nA distinction is also made in all these hides as to weights, sixty-one\r\npounds and up being heavy, sixty pounds and below being light and fifty\r\npounds and below being extra light.\r\n\r\nCow hides are selected as natives and branded cows; bull hides as\r\nnatives and branded bulls. While all bull hides are not sold as such,\r\nhides with a thick neck or pate are sold under this term.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grubs in Hides.=--There are two cattle “bot-flies” or “warble-flies,”\r\nas they are often termed. One of these (_Hypoderma lineata_) is found\r\nin the United States, being found more frequently in the southern part\r\nof the country. The adult is about the size of a honey bee. The female\r\ndeposits her eggs in summer in the region of the heel of the animal,\r\ncausing very much discomfort. In licking the irritated spot the eggs\r\nare taken into the mouth of the animal and hatched, the larvae entering\r\nthe esophagus or gullet and finally working their way into the cellular\r\ntissue beneath the skin of the back. In early spring they develop,\r\nforming lumps known as “warbles,” and become what are known as “grubs.”\r\nAfter working their way through the skin they drop to the ground, into\r\nwhich they burrow and pupate, finally emerging as adult flies. The\r\ndamage caused by these insects to the hides amounts to millions of\r\ndollars per year, as in general practice five grub holes constitute a\r\n“No. 2” hide, on which there is a deduction of one cent per pound.\r\n\r\nAccording to the rules of the trade, Texas and branded cows are grubbed\r\nfrom November 1 to June 1, Colorados are grubbed from December 1 to\r\nJune 1, native steers, native bulls and native cows are grubbed from\r\nJanuary 1 to June 1. No allowance is made after June 1 for grubs in\r\nhides taken off after that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Salt To Be Used.=--The kind of salt generally used in large plants\r\nfor this purpose is a rock salt, which is a mined product run through\r\ncrushers and screens. Large lumps are more or less objectionable and if\r\nallowed to be used will injure the appearance of the hide. Hides in a\r\npack weigh very heavily per cubic foot and the lower hides are subject\r\nto a considerable pressure, or weight. Large lumps of salt between the\r\nhides in the pack make bad looking indentations, although they do not\r\nnecessarily injure the hides for tanning purposes.\r\n\r\nThree parts of rock salt and one part of fine salt make a very good\r\ncombination. The fine salt quickly forms a moisture which the hides\r\nwill absorb, preventing quite a perceptible shrinkage as shown by\r\ncareful tests. When a pack of hides is taken up the “second salt” is\r\nsaved and by using one-third new with two-thirds of old salt it can be\r\nused over. It will be found that this addition of new salt about makes\r\nup for the loss in salt that is dissolved in the pack during the curing\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nSalt for the hides should be kept clean. If there is a great deal of\r\nmanure and dirt mixed with the salt, it discolors the hides, injuring\r\ntheir appearance. When the salt is found to be dirty and out of\r\ncondition it is advisable to screen it, using a screen same as is\r\nused for screening sand. The salt is thrown against the screen, the\r\nfiner salt will sift through and the coarser salt, dirt, etc., will\r\ngather at the bottom of the screen. Salt that has been through the\r\nscreen will be found comparatively clean and ready for use; that which\r\nhas not passed through should be washed. While this will dissolve a\r\nconsiderable amount of it, it will, at the same time, wash out most\r\nof the impurities. If handled in the above manner, a careful workman\r\nshould be able to salt hides with from thirty-one to thirty-five pounds\r\nof salt per hide.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Building of Packs of Hides.=--Packing hides is an operation which\r\nshould receive close and careful attention. In the building of the\r\npack, the outer edges should be kept high all the way around, so that\r\nthe center of the pack will hold liquid. When the pack is finished it\r\nshould be leveled off at the top so that it will be as near even as\r\npossible. The natural moisture in the hides, together with the salt,\r\nwill form a liquor which the hides absorb, and if the pack is built\r\nslanting, so as to allow the liquid to pass off, it will be found\r\nthat the hides are continuously drawing on the sides, and when they\r\nare taken up the shrinkage from green weights will be considerably in\r\nexcess of those from packs properly built.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trimming of Green Hides.=--Before the hides are packed they should be\r\nexamined for brands, etc., and be distributed to their proper packs,\r\naccording to assortment. The switch is cut off from the tail, any\r\nloose ends of the hides are trimmed off and the ears split. Unless\r\nthis is done, it makes an uneven pack on account of the thickness of\r\nthe ears; furthermore the salt does not have a chance to penetrate the\r\nears and they are liable to spoil. Any loose pieces of meat that the\r\nbutchers may have left on the hide should be taken off, as well as any\r\nexcess amount of fat. The hides after being trimmed should be allowed\r\nto lay for three to five hours to cool. If the hides are put into the\r\npack without doing this, it is likely that, when the pack is taken\r\nup, some hides will be found on which the hair has slipped; these are\r\nnecessarily No. 2 hides, and as the uniform rule is 1c per pound less\r\nfor No. 2’s than for No. 1’s, it will show a loss of approximately 50c\r\nto 60c per hide. Another bad feature of having “slip-hides” is the fact\r\nthat if the buyer finds them at all, he is always suspicious that there\r\nare others in the pack which are out of condition, that he has not\r\nseen, and that they will come out of the tannery with unsatisfactory\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWhen hides are put in the pack, extreme care should be used to see\r\nthat _every part_ of the hide is exposed to salt. The legs should\r\nbe straightened out flat and the pates thoroughly spread, so that\r\nthe salt may reach every part. Hides should lie in pack and salt for\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty days before they are fully cured. At the\r\nexpiration of this time they are ready for shipment, and are taken out\r\nof salt, inspected and each one rolled into a bundle and tied.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Switches.=--The switches should be spread out on the floor and given\r\na thorough chance to cool off, when they are thrown into a pack by\r\nthemselves and heavily salted. They should be watched closely, as there\r\nis unavoidably considerable blood and moisture in them, and if any sign\r\nof heating is found they should be overhauled and resalted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shrinkage of Hides.=--No set rule can be made as to how much hides\r\nwill actually shrink, but if the foregoing directions are followed\r\nclosely and intelligently the shrinkage may be kept at the minimum,\r\nwhich will usually range from 12 to 15 per cent. This is governed\r\nlargely, as before stated, by the amount of water which the hides take\r\nup on the killing floor, which if weighed with the hide will nearly all\r\nseep out when put into the packs and cause an excess shrinkage from the\r\noriginal green weights. Further the storage has a great deal to do with\r\nit, but if proper care is taken the shrinkage should be kept within the\r\nfigures given.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sheep Pelts.=--The handling of sheep pelts, especially in hot weather,\r\nrequires careful attention. The pelts, as soon as taken off, should\r\nbe spread out in a room where it is as cold as possible without being\r\nrefrigerated, and allowed to cool off for at least twelve hours before\r\nsalting. This is especially necessary when the animal slaughtered has\r\na very heavy fleece; with shearlings there is little or no necessity\r\nfor taking this precaution. Fleece skins, however, hold the heat, so\r\nthat when put into a pack and salted, if not properly cooled, they soon\r\nbegin to warm and decompose, and as soon as the wool slips, the leather\r\nof the skin is ruined.\r\n\r\nAfter the pelts have been spread out and allowed to thoroughly chill,\r\nas suggested, they should be salted in piles not to exceed thirty\r\ninches high by putting one skin on top of another, flesh side up, and\r\nusing a fine solar salt, care being taken that they are thoroughly\r\nsalted around the heads and leggings. After they have been in salt\r\nfor a week, it is well, especially in warm weather, to overhaul them,\r\nshifting the packs so that when through, the top pelts are on the\r\nbottom and vice versa. After they have lain in salt for two weeks they\r\nare ready for shipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nOLEO OIL AND STEARINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FATS -- ORIGIN OF BUTTERINE -- OLEO OIL -- OLEO FATS -- SELECTION AND\r\n  CARE -- CLEANLINESS AND COLLECTION -- CHILLING FAT -- COOLING WATER\r\n  -- MELTING -- SETTLING THE OIL -- CLARIFIERS -- SCRAP VAT -- SEEDING\r\n  OR GRAINING OIL -- PRESS ROOM -- COLLECTING OIL -- OIL RECEIVERS --\r\n  TEMPERATURE OF OIL DRAWN TO TIERCE -- STEARINE -- OIL HOUSE YIELDS --\r\n  GRADING FATS -- TESTS ON OIL FATS -- BUTCHER FATS -- MUTTON FAT --\r\n  OIL SELECTION -- OIL HOUSE OPERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fats.=--The largest item of value in slaughtered cattle is the beef.\r\nAs already stated, the second largest item is hides. The third item in\r\nvalue is fats. It has been one of the world’s staple articles of trade\r\nfor centuries and is made use of in the manufacture of many kinds of\r\narticles for man’s use, from those of comfort to those of destruction,\r\nperhaps only displaced in its multitude of uses by the one raw product,\r\ncoal tar.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Origin of Butterine.=--Prior to the Franco-Prussian war, or in\r\n1871, fats were used almost exclusively for soap making and other\r\nmanufacturing purposes, comparatively little of it being used for food\r\npurposes. During the siege of Paris a reward was offered to anyone who\r\nwould find a substitute for butter. A French scientist reasoned as\r\nfollows: Careful observation teaches that a cow that is fat and in good\r\nhealth makes better butter and more butter than one of the same quality\r\nthat is poor and emaciated, hence it must follow the cream of the milk,\r\nor the “butter-fat,” is in reality nothing more or less than Nature’s\r\nsurplus fat in the animal, and that in all cattle that are fed each\r\nday more than the requirements to build up the broken-down tissues a\r\nsurplus fat is deposited. This fat, the chemist decided, was as much a\r\nnatural butter as though it had been skimmed from milk, and starting on\r\nthis theory originated the manufacture of oleomargarine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Result of Investigation.=--The creating of this industry has meant\r\nmillions of dollars to this country in returns that have been made from\r\nthe sale of fats prepared into oil for manufacturing oleomargarine\r\ninstead of being melted into tallow for soap making and other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oleo Oil.=--Oleo oil is the name of one of the principal ingredients\r\nused in making oleomargarine, or imitation butter. The fat is put\r\nthrough a hasher, which thoroughly disintegrates it, cutting the tissue\r\nso that the oil is made free when heated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oleo Fats.=--The fats used for the manufacture of oleo oil are usually\r\nall the fats removed when the animal is slaughtered, including the\r\n“caul” fat or that fat surrounding the “omentum”; the ruffle fat, which\r\nis that fat surrounding the intestines, and to which the “runners” or\r\nround gut is attached; the heart casing, and fats attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Selection and Care.=--It is reasonable to suppose that all of these\r\nfats are of the same quality, but in the handling of this, during the\r\ncourse of slaughtering and treatment thereof, some of it necessarily\r\nbecomes unfit for oleo oil purposes, and is used in tallow. The amount\r\nused for tallow is regulated by the care and intelligence of the men\r\nin charge, and if properly handled a very small percentage of the fat\r\nin the animal should find its way to the tank house, as it nets much\r\nbetter results when put into oleo oil, as will be noted from the tests\r\nhereafter submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cleanliness and Collection.=--The fats, as rapidly as removed from the\r\nanimal, should be taken quickly in clean utensils and washed in medium\r\ntemperature water to remove any blood present. Thorough chilling of the\r\nfat is a very essential feature in making oleo oil. In order that this\r\nmay be done it is necessary that the fat be cut in small pieces, so\r\nthat the cold water can get at every part of it. A machine illustrated\r\nin Fig. 53 is used for cutting the fat before passing it into the cold\r\nwater. The water is circulated by the use of a pump and distributed\r\nover the fats from a perforated pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chilling Fat.=--The fat, while chilling, should be allowed to remain\r\nin cold water for about five hours, or until it has become thoroughly\r\nchilled. Precaution should be taken to see that no fat goes to the\r\nhasher, or melting kettle, until it is thoroughly chilled. Failure\r\nto do this is not particularly noticeable in the oleo oil when made,\r\nbut soon afterward results in a deterioration of the oil. It is\r\nnever objectionable to hold the fat from twelve to twenty hours, if\r\nnecessary, in the cold water, although five hours is sufficient. The\r\nconstant submergence of the fat by mechanical means or by hand is of\r\nprime importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--OLEO FAT CUTTER.]\r\n\r\nThe fats are ladled or forked from the chilling vat and placed on a\r\ntable to drain. The dryer the fat the better, but it must not lay\r\nunduly long to drain. From this table they are passed through an\r\nEnterprise steam jacketed hasher for grinding. Steam is kept on the\r\njacket to assist in rapidity in passing it through the hasher.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooling Water.=--The chilling or cooling of water is accomplished in\r\ntwo ways, by the introduction of ice or the cooling of the water or by\r\nsubmerging pipes in the tanks, and circulating chilled brine or ammonia\r\ngas through the pipes, same being a part of the refrigerating system.\r\nIn the latter case the pipes should be covered by a removable screen to\r\nprevent fats attaching to the pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--KETTLE FOR MELTING FATS FOR OLEO OIL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Melting.=--The fat when hashed is passed to an open top water jacketed\r\nkettle of the type shown in the illustration, Fig. 54.\r\n\r\nJust previous to beginning to hash the fat into the kettle the stirrer\r\nis placed in motion. The water in the jacket is heated up to a\r\ntemperature of about 180° F.\r\n\r\nWhen the kettle is partially filled and as the fat accumulates, it\r\nwill collect and hang to the stirring gear. To meet this condition the\r\nstirring gear is arranged to rise vertically on the shaft by lifting\r\nand assistance of the counterweight attached to it. The fat is removed\r\nby the use of a paddle, the stirrer lowered and started in motion. The\r\nfat is mixed with a large paddle so that the melting oil at the sides\r\nand bottom of the kettle is freely intermingled with the partially\r\nmelted fat.\r\n\r\nThe mass gradually assumes a murky yellow appearance as the oil is made\r\nfree. The man in charge of melting uses a bath thermometer constantly\r\nand regulates the temperature of the water in the jacket by the\r\nadmittance of cold water to chill it or steam to warm it so that the\r\ntemperature of the melting oil does not exceed 156° F. It usually takes\r\n1¹⁄₂ hours to properly melt the contents of a full kettle. When the\r\nmelting is complete the stirrer is raised out of the oil and allowed to\r\nremain raised while the oil is settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Settling the Oil.=--When the oil comes to rest about twenty pounds of\r\nfine salt is scattered over the surface, thrown in moderate handfuls so\r\nas to sprinkle the entire surface. This salt in settling clears the oil\r\nby carrying down the floating fibre by mechanical as well as chemical\r\naction. The oil usually has a scum on top and this is gently skimmed\r\noff and saved as a bottom for the next kettle. After settling about\r\nfifteen minutes the oil is run off by gently lowering the hinged pipe,\r\nthe oil as de-canted is passed to the clarifier.\r\n\r\nWhen the pure oil is run as low as can be conveniently done without\r\ncarrying off any scrap of settlings, the oil laying on the surface of\r\nthe water and sediment in the bottom is passed to some receptacle and\r\nsent to the pressure tanks. The kettle is well scrubbed, made clean and\r\nthe skimmed bottoms deposited ready for filling again with hashed fat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--SETTLING KETTLE FOR OLEO OILS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Clarifiers or Settling Kettles.=--Each kettle is provided with two\r\nclarifying or settling kettles. These are cone-shaped tanks in which\r\nthe oil from one melting kettle is deposited. The oil is allowed to\r\nstand as long as possible in a quiet state and the sediment or fibre\r\ncollects in the bottom of the cone. This is withdrawn at the bottom at\r\nfrequent intervals so as to free the oil from sediment and dirt. The\r\ntemperature of the oil carried in the clarifiers is 140°, kept uniform\r\nby use of warm water in the jacket.\r\n\r\nAfter settling the oil about two hours it is drawn to the seeding\r\ntrucks. Cotton flannel bags are usually put on over the outlet pipe so\r\nas to strain the oil and collect any floating pieces of tissue that\r\nwould otherwise pass to the seeding truck.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scrap Vat.=--A vessel which requires attention and in which the yield\r\nin the oil house can be very materially increased and improved by\r\nproper handling is the scrap vat. After the vat is melted and the oil\r\nsiphoned off, the balance or residue in kettle is drawn out of the\r\nbottom into the scrap vat, which is located directly under the melting\r\nkettle. This kettle should be kept full of hot water at a temperature\r\nof about 130° F., and when the scrap is dropped in the oil will\r\nimmediately come to the surface; this should be skimmed off promptly,\r\nfor if it is allowed to lie in the scrap vat a bad flavor will result\r\nand it will then have to be sold as an inferior grade of oil; but if\r\nskimmed as stated this strong flavored feature may be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhen through melting for the day, the steam should be turned on the\r\nscrap vats to bring them up to a temperature of 190° to 200° F. This\r\nwill release any fat yet remaining in the scrap, which should be\r\nskimmed and used for a lower grade of oil, as it will have a strong\r\nflavor. The balance of the scrap is then sent to the tank house, where\r\nit is cooked under pressure and the remaining oil taken out.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seeding or Graining Oil.=--The oil when settled in the clarifiers\r\nis passed to the seeding or graining trucks. The seeding truck plays\r\na very important part in the handling of oleo oil and is one of the\r\npoints where a great deal of trouble can be developed if not properly\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\nWhen the oil is drawn into the seeding trucks there should be no signs\r\nof any water. If there is any water left in the oil it naturally\r\nsettles to the bottom of the seeding truck. The oil usually being at a\r\ntemperature of 120° to 125° F., and it being three and sometimes four\r\ndays before it is cooled, the heat held in the oil, together with the\r\nwater and sediment that may be in the bottom, causes a decomposition\r\nand the result is “sour bottoms,” which are very offensive. If any\r\nof this sour material has gotten into the press, the stearine will be\r\nspotted and out of conditions. The oil will also show it more or less,\r\nso that it is absolutely necessary that this particular point be given\r\nvery close and careful attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--OLEO SEEDING TRUCK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Advantage of Wood Seeding Trucks._--It has for many years been\r\nconsidered necessary to line the seeding truck with galvanized iron, in\r\nfact many of the large melters today are using this style of truck. The\r\nseeding truck, however, which gives the best results is a wooden truck\r\n(see Fig. 56) without any lining, made of basswood, or whitewood, which\r\nare odorless, and can be readily cleaned and kept sweet. The objections\r\nto a truck lined with galvanized iron might be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, considerable salt is used in the material, more\r\nor less of which is left in the oil. When the melted fat is drawn off\r\ninto the seeding trucks and is left to stand for three or four days,\r\nthis salt attacks the iron, and if not watched very carefully small\r\npin-holes will be eaten through the iron, the result being that the\r\ngalvanized iron pan will leak into the wooden box proper. Again, every\r\ntime the seeding trucks are emptied, they are thoroughly washed and\r\nsteamed out and more or less of this water for washing finds its way\r\nin between the lining and the wooden box. When the seeding truck is\r\nfilled with oil, the weight of the oil causes this water, which is held\r\nbetween the iron and the wood, to ooze into the oil, causing “sour\r\nbottoms.” This particular point has caused the loss of a great many\r\nthousands of dollars in the manufacture of this product, even though it\r\nis apparently a very unimportant matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Wooden Trucks.=--In using wooden seeding trucks,\r\nattention is called to a very important item to be considered, and if\r\nnot carefully looked after the results will be unsatisfactory. The oil\r\nis drawn into seeding trucks at a temperature of about 120° to 125°\r\nF., which will shrink wood very rapidly, therefore the trucks should\r\nbe made out of thoroughly kiln-dried lumber, which should be _extra_\r\nkiln-dried. The bottom and sides of the truck are bolted together\r\nwith a bolt running through them and one on either end, so that any\r\nshrinkage of the wood can be taken up. The same is true of the sides\r\nof the truck. In each of the joints, after they are perfectly made, a\r\nstrand of wicking should be put in between the edges, so that when it\r\nis drawn down it forms a perfect packing. As is well understood, the\r\nshrinkage of wood is mostly crosswise of the grain, there being very\r\nlittle lengthwise; thus it will be seen that the wood in these trucks,\r\nboth at the sides and at the ends, must be put in so that it will\r\nall shrink uniformly. The bottom of the truck will naturally shrink\r\nsidewise and if the bolts are drawn up it stops the opening, while\r\nif the sides of the truck shrink, the bottom bolts can be drawn up,\r\nreadily stopping the leak. The ends of the truck must have the grain\r\nrunning up and down instead of crosswise, for if the bottom of the\r\ntruck joins sidewise and the end pieces are running crosswise of this\r\ngrain, it will be impossible to draw the bottom up tight, on account of\r\nthe lack of shrinkage of the ends where the grain runs lengthwise of\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--KNUCKLE TYPE OLEO OIL PRESS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Press Room and Pressing Stock.=--The room into which the seeding\r\ntrucks with their contents are run should be held at a temperature of\r\n75° to 90° F. The material in the seeding trucks, which is now called\r\n“stock” should be pressed at a temperature of from 78° to 84° F.,\r\naccording to its quality, as well as to the percentage of stearine\r\nwhich it is desirable to make. The lower the temperature at which\r\nthe oil is pressed the more stearine will be retained in the cloths.\r\nAfter the stock is chilled to above temperature it will be found that\r\na granulation has taken effect and oil will be observed on the top,\r\nwhereas the heavier and granulated parts of the fat will be at the\r\nbottom. This should be thoroughly mixed up before it is sent to the\r\npress, either by use of a dipper or mechanically, care being used not\r\nto disturb the bottom of the cooler. If there is any moisture in the\r\nbottom of the truck it would spoil the stock by mixing it. Whereas,\r\nif it is not agitated, when the stock is removed, the bottom can be\r\nexamined, and, if it is good, it can be used; otherwise it should be\r\nsent to the tallow tanks. After the stock is thoroughly broken up or\r\nmixed it is ready for the press, it first being wrapped in cloths.\r\n\r\nThe cloth used in connection with this press is a medium weight piece\r\nof cotton canvas, which is cut in the proper sized pieces, about\r\neighteen inches square. The cloth is first put on the “former” which is\r\nfilled with a dipper full of stock; the attendant wraps it up carefully\r\nand the man filling the press as it comes around in the wheel, takes\r\nthe wrapped stock and lays it on the plate, using eight bags of stock\r\non each plate in the press, generally using sixty steel plates for each\r\npress. When the press is full the power is turned on. The slow speed\r\nshould be used almost exclusively after the press is started in order\r\nto give the oil sufficient time to strain through the canvass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--OLEO OIL RECEIVER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Collecting Oil.=--The oil from the press should run to a receiving\r\ntank, as many being used as is necessary to keep the different grades\r\nof oil separated. Where oil is being made in large quantities it is\r\nalways advisable to have the receiving tank hold sixty tierces, or a\r\ncar load of oil, for if smaller receivers are used the oil is likely to\r\nbe irregular.\r\n\r\nThe quality of oil varies, as does the quality of cattle; for instance,\r\nchoice native cattle, which are very fat, make a finer, better oil than\r\nwestern cattle which are not in as good condition, and as the killing\r\nis always liable to run irregular, if the oil is not assembled in large\r\nquantities, it is often perceptible, and a manufacturer soon acquires\r\nthe reputation of making irregular oil. When that reputation is once\r\nestablished buyers scrutinize closely before making purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oil Receivers.=--The receivers of the oil should be either jacketed\r\nor have a boat bottom; that is, one vat placed inside of the other\r\n(see Fig. 58), so that the temperature of the oil in the receivers may\r\nbe regulated, but under no conditions should steam pipes be submerged\r\nin oleo oil; all heating should be done by contact surfaces with hot\r\nwater. In having the vat made with a boat bottom it is simply necessary\r\nto fill up the space with water and turn on steam, holding the water at\r\nthe desired temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Temperature of Oil Drawn to Tierce.=--The oil in the receiver, when\r\nready to be tierced, should be raised to a temperature of from 116° to\r\n118° F., and then drawn off, the tierces being filled through a side\r\nbung hole. After the tierce is filled it should be rolled away and\r\nleft undisturbed in a temperature of 50° F. for at least four days.\r\nThe oil thus handled will show a granulation, which is very desirable.\r\nIf the oil is not allowed to stand until it has thoroughly granulated,\r\nor “seeded” it will come out smooth or pasty, and pasty oil is very\r\nobjectionable to the purchaser. If the oil is not drawn off at this\r\ntemperature it will be found difficult to have it seed properly, as it\r\nchills too quickly for a good granulation to take effect. It is not\r\nwise to draw the oil into a temperature lower than 50° F. After the oil\r\nhas been seeded it can be kept in any storage that is available below\r\n60° F., but it must be put into the refrigerating temperature for the\r\nfirst three or four days, and not at any time carried at a temperature\r\nbelow 45°.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stearine.=--Stearine is the product left in the cloths after pressing\r\nthe stock. This product is used for many purposes, but largely for the\r\nmanufacture of compound lard on account of its hardness. (Ordinary\r\ntallow will run 41¹⁄₂ to 43; oleo oil runs 40 to 42; oleo stearine\r\nshould run 50 to 52, titer.)\r\n\r\nAfter the oil is thoroughly pressed out, the press is opened and the\r\nstearine taken out of the cloths. The stearine should be thrown into a\r\nbin where there is an abundant circulation of pure air, in order to\r\nthoroughly cool, for if it is put into the package too warm, a mold\r\nwill form which deteriorates it and reduces its value. After it is\r\nthoroughly chilled it is put into packages, compressed by a machine as\r\nshown, which saves labor and puts more material into the package; or\r\npounding it with a maul as it is deposited in the tierces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--STEARINE PACKER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stearine Storage._--Stearine, after being put in packages, can be\r\nheld for thirty days in ordinary storage. If held longer than that, it\r\nshould be put into a room kept at a temperature of from 40° to 45° F.\r\nand which is perfectly dry. Stearine, generally speaking, is a very\r\nunsatisfactory article to carry any length of time, for, in pressing,\r\nany moisture which may be in the stock is left in the stearine, and if\r\ncarried for some time this moisture produces a discoloration, which\r\nis known to the trade as “spotted stearine.” It also causes a moldy\r\nor musty smell, which injures it for edible purposes, and while it is\r\noften carried for months for an anticipated rise in the market, it\r\nis quite as often regretted that it was not sold when it was in good\r\ncondition for the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Packages._--Stearine is always packed in slack packages, the regular\r\npackage being 34 inches high, 90 inches in circumference at the bilge\r\nand 23⁵⁄₈ inches across the head with eight patented hoops. Oleo oil is\r\nalways put into a special tierce which is 34 inches high, 81 inches in\r\ncircumference at bilge and 21 inches across heads, with six iron hoops.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oil House Yields.=--The yields of oleo oil and stearine from stock\r\nare regulated largely by the prices of the different articles, as, for\r\ninstance, when oil is low and stearine is high it is advisable to press\r\nthe stock at a lower temperature, making all the stearine possible.\r\nReverse the conditions and it is advisable to press the stock at a high\r\ntemperature, making all the oil possible, hence the general yield of\r\noil in stearine is largely regulated by the price of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grading Fats.=--As the different kinds of fat have more or less\r\ndifferent flavors, it is wise to make careful selections in order to\r\nget the best results, it being impossible to make a grade of all No.\r\n1 oil, 10 or 15 per cent of the total being No. 2. The balance of the\r\nproduct, eliminating the 10 or 15 per cent should be strictly No. 1\r\noil, but if the whole output is made into one grade, it would not be\r\nacceptable as No. 1. Hence it will be seen that it is the better part\r\nof wisdom to make two and sometimes three grades of this product, as\r\nindicated above.\r\n\r\nOf all the oleo oil made in this country, 75 to 90 per cent is shipped\r\nto Holland, where it is made into butterine and distributed throughout\r\nthe continent and England. The requirements of these consumers seem\r\nto have changed within the last few years, and the melters of oleo oil\r\nstrive to get the oils in the condition to best suit the Hollanders’\r\ndemands. What they seem to require is, first of all, a very neutral\r\noil, or in other words an oil with as little flavor and smell as\r\npossible, whereas only a few years ago just the opposite was the case,\r\nand the whole endeavor at that time was to get an oil with as much\r\nflavor as could be made. In grading the fats a neutral or No. 1 oil is\r\nobtained from the following parts:\r\n\r\n  Caul fat.\r\n  Ruffle fat.\r\n  Briskets trimmings.\r\n  Crotch trimming from pickings.\r\n  Paunch trimmings.\r\n  Pluck trimmings.\r\n  Reed trimmings.\r\n  Heart casing fats.\r\n\r\nFor a No. 2, or second grade, which, though it may realize nearly as\r\nhigh a price as the first oil, is an oil of high flavor, the following\r\nparts are used:\r\n\r\n  Small fat.\r\n\r\n  Chipped fat, which is taken off of the middles.\r\n\r\n  Machine fat, which is fat taken off of rounds by the fatting machines.\r\n\r\n  Heart trimmings.\r\n\r\n  Pluck trimmings.\r\n\r\n  Miscellaneous bed pickings of the second grade.\r\n\r\n  Kidney fat.\r\n\r\n  Clean trimmings from cattle which are being cut up for canning or\r\n  sausage purposes.\r\n\r\n  Skimmings from scrap vat of No. 1 oil.\r\n\r\nA third grade of oleo oil, which will be quite inferior to either of\r\nthe other two named, but for which at times there is a good demand,\r\noften netting more than the same product would, if made into rendered\r\ntallow, is made from the following trimmings:\r\n\r\n  Head fat.\r\n\r\n  Fat trimmed from cattle heads when cheeking.\r\n\r\n  Plucked sweetbreads trimming.\r\n\r\n  Liver trimmings.\r\n\r\n  Bladder trimmings.\r\n\r\n  Fat from chilled beef tongues, when they are trimmed.\r\n\r\n  Miscellaneous fats from other departments.\r\n\r\n  The skimmings from the oleo press cloths boiling before soda has been\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n  Scrap vat skimmings from the second grade of oil.\r\n\r\nIf fat is graded as above suggested, and handled properly in the\r\ndifferent departments in the oleo house, satisfactory grades of oil\r\nshould be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tests on Oil Fats.=--The following are tests showing the pounds and\r\npercentages of yield of different kinds of fat when made into oleo oil.\r\nThe tables, as will be noted, only show the percentages of fat in oleo\r\nstock, this consisting of the oil and stearine before pressing.\r\n\r\nTEST NO. 1.\r\n\r\n    _Caul fat run to No. 1 oleo oil:_\r\n  Hot weight from beds (dry)                    1,505 lbs.\r\n  Chilled twenty hours, net weight              1,937 lbs.\r\n                                                ----------\r\n    Gain from hot weight               28.70% =   432 lbs.\r\n  Weight of chilled fat to oil house            1,937 lbs.\r\n\r\n  This fat, hashed into melting kettle, cooked one hour and five\r\n  minutes, settled one hour, drawn into receiver, settled two hours,\r\n  and drawn into coolers, gives following:\r\n\r\n  Yield of oleo stock  1,238 lbs. = { 82.26% from hot weight\r\n                                    { 63.91% from chilled weight\r\n\r\n    _Ruffle fat run to No. 1 oleo oil:_\r\n  Hot weight from beds (dry)                1,518 lbs.\r\n  Chilled twenty hours, net weight          1,735 lbs.\r\n                                            ----------\r\n    Gain from hot weight           14.29% =   217 lbs.\r\n  Weight chilled fat to oil house           1,735 lbs.\r\n\r\n  This fat, hashed into melting kettle and cooked one hour then settled\r\n  one hour fifteen minutes, after which drawn into receiver and again\r\n  settled for two hours, and drawn into cooler, gives following:\r\n\r\n  Yield of oleo stock 1,018 lbs. = { 67.06% from hot weight\r\n                                   { 58.67% from chilled weight\r\n\r\nThe second test is similar, except that it is made on the “peck and\r\nreed” fat, which is used in a No. 1 oil.\r\n\r\nIn the third test chipped fat is used for No. 1 oleo.

The fat in this particular part seems to be\r\nricher in oil and in the general handling of same it rarely goes into\r\nthe water to absorb additional weight, as it is generally purchased\r\nfrom the retail butcher after the carcass has been cut up. This in\r\nitself is a large branch of the business, in many places melters making\r\na practice of collecting from the butchers their bones, tallow and fat.\r\nThe following test will give an idea of the yield of the different\r\nproducts brought from a butcher’s shop, when used in an oleo factory or\r\ntank room. The prices quoted are those that were paid at the time tests\r\nwere made.

There are times when there is\r\na ready sale for this oil, in which event it is run in the oil house\r\nby precisely the same rules as those laid down for the melting of beef\r\ntallow. The yields on mutton fat are considerably less, however, than\r\non beef fat. When it is not advisable to put it into mutton oleo, it\r\nis nearly always advisable to make a mutton tallow, providing there is\r\nsufficient amount of the raw stock on hand to warrant it, as mutton\r\ntallow invariably brings a better price than ordinary commercial\r\ntallow. Mutton tallow runs considerably higher in titer than ordinary\r\ntallow. It is also much whiter and is often used in the manufacture of\r\ncosmetics, etc. When made into oil it should be made from mutton fat\r\nonly. Many lard refiners have discovered that where a complaint was\r\nmade regarding the quality of their lard it was traceable to their oleo\r\nstearine, in which mutton fat had been used, this fat having a tendency\r\nto turn the lard rancid much earlier than where beef oleo stearine is\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oil Selection.=--In some establishments where high colored oils\r\ndisposing toward a yellow tint are produced, they are selected\r\nseparately in the seeding room and the oil segregated on account of its\r\ndesirability for domestic butterine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oil House Operation.=--The following instructions if complied with\r\nwill result in a satisfactory operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_First._--See that the fat is in good condition, properly trimmed, all\r\npieces of meat, lungs, guts, etc., completely removed, and that the fat\r\nis handled promptly, not allowing it to become stale, and sour before\r\nit is received.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Second._--When it is received, don’t pile up in the vats; see that the\r\nice water is in contact with all parts of it and thoroughly chill it.\r\nWhen caul fat is extra heavy, examine all the largest pieces closely\r\nand see that they are thoroughly chilled through.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third._--Arrange to have no ice or cooling pipes in the vat where the\r\nfat is received, it being thrown in here to give it a thorough washing.\r\nThe next vat to which it is thrown, however, should have cooling pipes.\r\nThe water in the vats into which the fat is washed and chilled must be\r\nchanged daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fourth._--Do not begin hashing until the fat is properly cooled. It\r\nwill take from three to five hours to accomplish this, under ordinary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fifth._--It is wise never to begin hashing until there is fat enough\r\nto either finish the day’s work, or at least to keep the house running\r\nand to hash a kettle full regularly, as it is impracticable to stop in\r\nthe middle of the operation of hashing a kettle of fat, for when once\r\ncommenced it must be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sixth._--Use sufficient steam on the hasher jacket to facilitate the\r\ncutting, having the material come through as cold as possible. If\r\ntoo much steam is used it partially melts the fat in the hasher and\r\ndisintegration is not perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seventh._--For melting kettles which hold about 1,400 pounds of hashed\r\nfat about half an hour should be required to do the hashing. While the\r\ncapacity of the hasher might be much greater it is well to have the fat\r\npartially melted during the course of hashing, so as not to have too\r\nlarge a body of unmelted fat in the melters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eighth._--The time for melting, settling and letting down the stock\r\ninto the clarifiers from the melting kettles should not exceed two\r\nhours and twenty minutes. As soon as hashing is begun, the agitator\r\nshould be started revolving. When through hashing, the man overseeing\r\nthe melting, after allowing the agitator to run five or ten minutes,\r\nshould lift it out of the kettle and clean it off thoroughly with a\r\npaddle, and then drop it back into the kettle. If this is not done\r\nseveral times during the course of hashing, unmelted fats will be found\r\nin the bottoms when they are ready to drop to scrap vat.\r\n\r\nThe steam should be turned on in the jacket of the kettle as soon\r\nas hashing is started. Keep the steam on until the fat shows a\r\ntemperature of 140° to 142° F. The steam should then be shut off and\r\nthe surplus heat in the kettle will run the fat up to 155° F., which\r\nshould be the maximum melting point for No. 1 melting oil. No. 2, or\r\nthe flavored oil, may be melted to 158° F. No. 3, or lowest grade of\r\noil, may be melted at 160° F., and in some instances 165° F.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is evident that the fat is thoroughly melted the agitator\r\nshould be stopped and pulled out of the oil, and it should stand at\r\nleast an hour, the steam being shut off from the jacket, giving it a\r\nchance to settle. On this particular process depends the entire result\r\nof the making of oleo oil, as the fat being so thoroughly disintegrated\r\nin the hasher when it is melted, a great deal of tissue from this fat\r\nis held in suspension in the oil and it must have very careful handling\r\nin order to get it thoroughly settled out. If it is not all removed\r\nfrom the oil, the latter will turn strong from the decomposition of the\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nAfter the oil has settled throw in about fifteen to twenty pounds\r\nof fine salt, scattering it thoroughly over the surface of the oil,\r\nthe salt having the effect of carrying with it any unsettled tissues\r\nwhich may still remain in the oil. The top of the oil should then be\r\ncarefully skimmed, for there is a scum floating on the top when it is\r\nsettled. After this is done the siphon pipe is dropped down into the\r\noil and the oil is taken off very carefully. It is very essential in\r\ndrawing this with the siphon pipe that as little scrap and water as\r\npossible be taken with it. After the oil has been taken off, the bottom\r\nvalve of the melting kettle is opened, dropping the contents into the\r\nscrap vat. The kettle should be thoroughly washed and cleaned before it\r\nis used again.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ninth._--The oil now in the clarifier should be kept at a temperature\r\nof about 140° F. It should be allowed to remain in the clarifying\r\nkettle about an hour, and during this time should lose about ten\r\ndegrees in temperature, perfect settling being possible only by\r\nlowering the temperature of the material. While oil is in the\r\nclarifier, sprinkle about four pounds of salt over it. As soon as it\r\nis settled skim immediately, and again a second time before the oil is\r\ndrained into seeding truck.\r\n\r\nIt should be drawn off into the seeding truck at a temperature of 120°\r\nto 125° F., care being taken at all times in siphoning the oil from\r\nthe different kettles to see that no water has gotten into the oil. As\r\nit is impossible to draw the oil all out of the different kettles with\r\nthe siphon, the oil that is left in the bottom of the kettle each time\r\nshould be taken back and put into the melting kettle and allowed to run\r\nthrough with the next melting of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tenth._--Be particular to have the kettles washed each time after\r\nbeing emptied and see that they are kept at proper heat to receive each\r\nlot of fat when ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eleventh._--See that all water, siphon pipes, and drawing-off pipes to\r\nthe seeders be thoroughly scalded and steamed out before drawing, as\r\nthere is invariably an accumulation in these pipes, which, if allowed\r\nto go uncared for, will turn rancid and injure the quality of the oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nBONE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BONE DEPARTMENT -- HARD BONE -- GLUE BONE -- BONE PRODUCTS -- HORNS\r\n  -- MANUFACTURED ARTICLES -- SKULLS -- TEST YIELD FROM SKULLS AND FEET\r\n  -- BUTTOCKS AND THIGHS -- BLADES AND RIBS -- DRYING -- CRUSHED BONE\r\n  -- GRINDING BONE -- NEATS FOOT OIL STORAGE -- NEATS FOOT OIL PURIFIER\r\n  -- YIELD TESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bone Department.=--The bone department is where the bones are cared\r\nfor and prepared for commercial purposes. Nearly all bones that are of\r\nvalue, to be sold as such, come from cattle, and to this department is\r\nsent the horns, skulls, jaws, feet, shank bones, thigh bones, blade\r\nbones, rib bones and those resulting from cutting and boning cattle.\r\nThese yield what is known as manufacturing bone, such as shins,\r\nblades, buttocks and thigh bones. Most of the balance is used for bone\r\nfertilizer, glue and grinding. The bone usually produced in the bone\r\ndepartment is hard bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hard Bone.=--Hard bones are those not cooked sufficiently to extract\r\nthe glue stock, but enough to remove all grease. They are cooked in\r\nopen vats. Excessive boiling brings the bones out in what is known to\r\nthe trade as a “chalky condition” and injures the quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Glue Bones.=--Bones used for glue stock are green bones just as taken\r\nfrom the animal, or dried hard bone. In the former case the bone is\r\ncrushed green, washed, boiled, and the liquor collected, filtered and\r\nevaporated. The residue is dried and is the article of commerce sold\r\nunder the heading of “Steam Bone,” used extensively in fertilizer\r\nmanufacturing. Those who slaughter on a moderate scale are usually not\r\nin a position to undertake the manufacture of glue. Consequently they\r\nare most interested in proper methods of manufacturing hard bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bone Products.=--Small bones are also converted into bone charcoal,\r\nwhich is largely used for the purpose of bleaching sugar and in\r\nvarious medicinal preparations. Bones are used for a great variety of\r\npurposes, including the manufacture of bone charcoal for bleaching,\r\nempyreumatic oils; tallow; black pigment for painting, shoe blacking\r\nand filling sheet rubber for overshoes; bone dust for manure; sulphate\r\nof ammonia; cupels; vitrified bone of use in making opal glass, and\r\nin the manufacture of knife-handles, combs, fans, buttons, etc. Bones\r\nalso furnish gelatine and glue, and are the starting point for the\r\nmanufacture of phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Horns.=--Horns are the most valuable bone products measured by weight.\r\nOwing to the dehorning of cattle as well as the breeding of polled\r\ncattle, the supply of horns has been greatly diminished, and whereas\r\ntwenty-five years ago horns were worth $20.00 a ton they are now worth\r\nfrom $280.00 to $300.00 per ton if they are of the proper selections,\r\nhence it will be seen that intelligent handling is worth while. The\r\nhorns severed from the head preferably by sawing and cutting at a point\r\nbeyond the meeting point of skull and horn, are thrown into a vat of\r\nwater, held at a temperature of from 140° to 150° F. After soaking for\r\nten or fifteen minutes they are taken out and by hammering the horn\r\nacross some solid substance, or by laying it on a block and pounding\r\nit with a weight or mallet, the pith slips out. The piths are dried\r\nand used in the manufacture of glue. The horns should be stored in a\r\nroom where there is ample outside air circulation and not too dry.\r\nArtificial heat will cause them to crack. They are never dried on steam\r\ncoils. Selections are made for some markets, although they are usually\r\nsold as taken off.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manufactured Articles.=--The manufacture of horns into manufactured\r\narticles is a highly specialized work and rarely undertaken by the\r\npacker as a commercial possibility. Horns are used for the manufacture\r\nof combs and various other ornamental articles. In the course of\r\nmanufacturing, the tip is sawed off to the hollow part of the horn.\r\nIt is then split open, the horn is steamed, softened and flattened by\r\npressure, usually hydraulic pressure. Any checks or flaws in the horn\r\ndamage it for manufacturing purposes. If submitted to excessive heat in\r\ndrying or stored in a room that is hot and dry they are sure to become\r\ndamaged. When in storage they should be placed in a cellar or room\r\nwhere there is some moisture, but not enough to cause them to mold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--CATTLE HEAD SPLITTERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Skulls.=--The treatment of skulls in process is as follows: The cheek\r\nmeat is removed from the head, the jaws pulled out, the head split and\r\nbrain removed, and the skull is ready for the cooking vat. The brain\r\nis an edible product, for which there is a ready sale in most markets,\r\nconsequently they should be properly taken out. The illustration, Fig.\r\n60, is of a machine with a hollow knife intended for splitting the\r\nskull but not damaging the brain. With this machine the heads are split\r\nafter the jaws are pulled. The head is laid on the table with the teeth\r\nup. The knife is made with a semi-circular space in the sharp edge\r\nwhich comes down over the brain without touching same as the balance\r\nof the blade is forced through the skull, leaving the brain intact\r\nwhile separating the skull bones. Where a large number of heads are\r\nhandled in this manner it saves a great deal of labor. It is desirable\r\nto remove the brains before cooking the skulls, as the bones become\r\ndiscolored if the brain is left in the skull.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cooking._--After the skulls are placed in a tank they should be kept\r\ncovered with cold water until collected in sufficient quantity for\r\ncooking. They should be thoroughly washed, as there is a large amount\r\nof clotted blood usually adhering to the skull, and if not well washed\r\nthe grease derived from the cooking is discolored and injured. In\r\nconnection with the washing, it is always well, when the vat is filled,\r\nto heat the water to a point about 90° F. and draw this water off. The\r\nvat is then filled with water sufficient to cover the skull and the\r\nsteam turned on, the temperature raised to 200° F. The steam should be\r\ngraduated so as to hold this temperature eight and one-half or nine\r\nhours, when the heads will be found to be cooked sufficiently. The\r\nsteam is then shut off and the oil cooked from the heads is allowed to\r\ncollect on the surface, after which it is skimmed and strained, and\r\nallowed to settle. It is then ready for tiercing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cleaning._--The skulls should be kept covered with water until ready\r\nfor washing. This is done by passing through a reel screen arranged\r\nwith a central hollow axle or a perforated pipe suspended in the top,\r\nused for spraying the revolving bones with a plentiful supply of warm\r\nwater for cleansing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jaw Bones._--Jaw bones should be handled the same as skulls, except\r\nthat they should be cooked from nine to ten hours. The jaws are\r\ncracked at right angles to their length in order to open the bone for\r\nextracting all oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying._--The bones are now ready for drying. Dryers are mentioned\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Feet.=--The cattle feet are of prime importance owing to the value of\r\nthe products resulting. In mentioning feet, we mean comprehensively the\r\nfeet from knee to hoof, inclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Washing Feet._--The feet upon being taken from the animal should be\r\nwashed promptly, and all manure and refuse removed preferably through a\r\nrevolving washer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cutting Sinews and Sawing Bones._--The sinews are removed from the\r\nfeet, and the shin bones sawed out. The sawing of the bone is an\r\nimportant matter. The bone should be rigidly held and sawed by a sharp\r\nmoving blade, the saw carriage moved against the tightly held foot. The\r\nset of saw should be such as to avoid a ragged edge. Saw should have\r\nhigh speed up to 1,200 r. p. m. and be filed with but little set. In\r\nmoving the blade it should be done firmly and regularly--not jerky.\r\n\r\nThe cutting should be done about midway through the “sponge” formation\r\nat end of bone so that the oil can be cooked clean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--BONE SAW WITH IRON FRAME.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Raw Shin Bones Cooling._--These bones should be kept in clear cold\r\nrunning water until the day’s cook is collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Removal of Hoofs._--The removal of hoofs is to be done by putting the\r\nfeet in a tank or tub of water. Steam is injected into the water and\r\nthe temperature raised to about 180° F., where it is maintained for 20\r\nto 30 minutes, or until the hoofs will slip. Hoofs are pinched off and\r\nfeet passed to cook boxes. Hoofs are usually air dried and selected\r\ninto white and striped hoofs, the most valuable used and sold for\r\nmanufacturing. Black hoofs are ordinarily coil dried and ground for\r\nfertilizer. The oil is the neatsfoot oil of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cooking Shin Bones._--Shin bones should be cooked about eight hours at\r\na temperature of 160° to 170° F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--HAND HOOF PULLER.]\r\n\r\nJudgment is to be used in the cooking as the age of the cattle and the\r\nhardness of the bone will have to do with the bone appearing “chalky”\r\nwhen dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--POWER HOOF PULLER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cooking Feet._--The foot portion resulting in the small knuckles when\r\ncooked is cooked separately from the shin bones and oil handled in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skimming the Oil._--The oil rising to the top of the cook vats should\r\nbe carefully skimmed off with as little water as possible. It should\r\nbe strained through a fine mesh screen covered with two thicknesses of\r\nscrim, so as to take out all floating fibre or floaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skimming and Settling._--Upon skimming deposit oil in the oil\r\nreceivers, keep the oil under heat at a temperature of 150° F. The\r\nsettling or sediment should be daily removed at the drain outlet until\r\noil begins to show, since the settling and moisture are sure means of\r\nmaking oil sour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--REVOLVING BONE WASHER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Purifying Oil._--The oil is kept in the containers until ready for\r\npurifying. The two receivers are connected together by a common pipe\r\nwhich terminates in a pipe arranged in the form of a cross with a tee\r\nconnection at each end. Over the ends of this cross are suspended\r\ncotton flannel bags of double thickness tied tightly over the tees. The\r\noil is strained through these into the purifier where it is settled\r\nfor two or three hours. Should any moisture appear it is withdrawn\r\nat the drain cock at bottom. Bags should be used once and carefully\r\nwashed. The oil is then dried out by heating the same through the steam\r\njacket on kettle until it reaches a temperature of about 250° F., at\r\nwhich temperature it is held several hours. The oil is to be stirred\r\noccasionally during the drying period. The steam is closed and the oil\r\nallowed to settle and cool and is then put in casks. Temperature of\r\noil when drawn into casks, about 80° to 90° F., casks, hard wood, well\r\nhooped and of superior quality to prevent leakage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neatsfoot Oil._--Obtained from cooking round shin, flat shin, small\r\nknuckle bones (being bones from feet) and shin bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Finishing Bones._--After taking the oil and depositing same in the\r\nneatsfoot oil receiver, the shin bones are removed and placed in the\r\npolisher where they are revolved for about one hour or until the bones\r\nare cleaned. Warmed water is passed through the bones during this\r\nprocess, introduced through hollow shaft in washer. The substance\r\nwashed out contains more or less oil which should be trapped and the\r\nclear oil skimmed off, and balance of material sent to the rendering\r\ntanks. The knuckles are similarly treated until cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying Bones._--When the shin bones are washed and cleaned they should\r\nbe spread on racks to dry, in natural temperature (not coil dried) and\r\nout of draft or cold temperatures to avoid checking or splitting. Small\r\nknuckle bones from the feet are to be coil dried for manufacturing bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sinews._--These are chiefly sold for glue stock. In removing sinews\r\nfrom the legs, care must be used not to cut too deep in the heel of the\r\nfoot, it being preferred to leave some glue stock on the foot rather\r\nthan to cut too deep and remove the fat which goes to make up the\r\nneatsfoot oil which is much more valuable than the glue stock. This\r\npart of the product, well drained, should be taken to a cool, although\r\nnot necessarily refrigerated room, and thoroughly salted; It is often\r\nfound necessary to overhaul it and resalt it in order to keep it from\r\n“sweating.” After it has been cured ten days or two weeks it is ready\r\nfor the glue department.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Test Yield from Skulls and Feet.=--Test on following page shows the\r\nyield from head and feet of 130,470 cattle, same based on the market\r\nprices prevailing at the time the test was made.

If hard bone is being\r\nmade these bones are cooked in open vat from six to eight hours.\r\nCellular bones are usually cracked so as to make for free extraction of\r\noil.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drying.=--Two systems of drying are used in the bone department.\r\nThe open air system for horns, selected white and striped hoof\r\nfor manufacturing, shin bones, buttock bones, and those sold for\r\nmanufacturing purposes; the coil, or room, drying principle, for\r\ngrinding bone. The latter, crushed bone, is sold to glue makers and\r\ngrinders. The usual method of handling the latter style of drying is to\r\nmake platform coils or grids of 1¹⁄₄-inch pipe of an area convenient,\r\nas ten by sixteen feet, or units convenient to the space. These are\r\nin multiple and arranged to be accessible from two or more sides for\r\nconvenience in filling and removing bones. The grids should be placed\r\ntwelve or fifteen inches above the floor to permit cleaning underneath.\r\nThe pipes or grids are usually substantially supported to carry the\r\nweight placed upon them. A wire screen of No. 5 screen 1¹⁄₄-inch mesh\r\nis a convenience to prevent bones dropping through. The bones are piled\r\nupon the grids to dry, when they are then transferred to storage rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Crushed Bone.=--The skulls, jaws and larger bones, are usually crushed\r\nbefore storing so as to get a greater weight in less space. In this\r\ncondition they are ready for grinding into “raw bone meal,” the name\r\ngiven to ground bone for sale to glue makers for extracting glue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grinding Bone.=--Ground bone is usually ground through an attrition\r\nmill, of which there are several types. The mill delivers the grindings\r\nto a bucket type endless chain elevator, which in turn passes it\r\nthrough a screen--shaking or revolving--preferably the latter. The\r\nscreen is usually about three feet in diameter by twelve feet long and\r\ncovered with a screening of No. 16 wire, eight meshes per inch, which\r\nscreens it to a size that will readily pass through a grain drill.\r\nThe tailings or over sized bone is returned to the mill for further\r\ngrinding.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Neatsfoot Oil Storage Tank.=--This is preferably a jacketed tank, one\r\ntank within the other, and must be made with a jacket to withstand\r\nthe pressure that may be applied. Consequently the jacket should be\r\nreinforced with stay bolts so as to prevent distortion when pressure\r\nis applied. Any and all oil settling vats are best made cylindrical in\r\nform with a sharp cone at bottom. The cone is equipped for withdrawing\r\nsediment at the bottom and for withdrawing oil for purification\r\nsufficiently high in the cone to avoid withdrawing any sediment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Neatsfoot Oil Purifiers.=--The same type of kettle or tank as\r\ndescribed above is required, the latter being sufficient in size to\r\naccumulate a week’s work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yield Tests.=--The appended tests give the resulting yields from\r\nhandling skulls and jaws, feet and shanks:\r\n\r\nTEST YIELD FROM SKULLS AND JAWS OF 1,209 CATTLE\r\n\r\n  =========================+======+=======+======\r\n                           |      |       |  Per\r\n                           |      |Average|  Cent\r\n                           |      |  per  | Green\r\n        Products           |Weight| head  |Weight\r\n  -------------------------+------+-------+------\r\n  No. 1 Ground Bone        | 1972 |  1.63 |  9.48\r\n  No. 2 Ground Bone        |  282 |   .23 |  1.35\r\n  Bone Meal                | 1381 |  1.14 |  6.64\r\n  Butter Stock Tallow      | 1353 |  1.12 |  6.51\r\n  Bone House Tallow        |  585 |   .48 |  2.81\r\n  Pressed Tankage 50% water| 6512 |  5.37 | 31.32\r\n  =========================+======+=======+======\r\n\r\nTotal weight of feet from 1,209 cattle, 20,790.11 pounds.

It being impossible to\r\nrender offal to advantage under these conditions, the “digester” as it\r\nis called by many, was evolved. It consists of a closed tank in which\r\ncooking is done at forty pounds steam pressure, giving a temperature\r\nof nominally 287° F., this high temperature thoroughly disintegrating\r\nall products in the tank, liberating all the grease. The residue from\r\ncooking in this manner, after being pressed, is dried and sold as\r\nfertilizer. The effectiveness of this process is shown, for instance,\r\nby the fact that if a hundred cattle heads are put into a tank, after\r\ncooking, the bones are entirely disintegrated, except the teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tank House Design.=--Almost any arrangement of tank, surface box and\r\npress can be made to serve the purpose of rendering. The method and\r\narrangement shown herein are those practiced by one of the revisors of\r\nthis work and embodies principles as described.\r\n\r\nThe requisite apparatus for a rendering or tank house consists of but\r\nfew articles, viz: the rendering tank or digester, the surface or\r\nskimming box, and a press, but the design and operation is of such\r\nconsequence that the same will be described in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Isolation and Ventilation.=--The rendering building from its character\r\nshould be isolated and arranged for ventilation on at least three\r\nsides. The United States sanitary requirements compel the complete\r\nseparation of the edible from the inedible section by the use of\r\nseparate buildings or a parting wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--SECTION THROUGH TANK HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Separation of Press Room.=--If the business is large the owner is\r\nfully justified in extending the parting wall through and dividing the\r\npress room. This arrangement requires the double investment in presses,\r\ncloths and all equipment, but gives the advantage that the pressings\r\ncan be collected from edible tankage and used for edible purposes,\r\nprovided always that the equipment is kept in proper shape. Whereas, if\r\nthe parting wall is not extended through the press room, the oils are\r\nconsidered contaminated and are usable only for inedible purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--LITTLE NECK RENDERING TANK.]\r\n\r\nThe section shown indicates that type of house where the press room is\r\nsingle, and the house above the press floor is divided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--TANK HOUSE, SHOWING NESTING OF TANKS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tank House Hazards.=--The tank house, from the nature of the business\r\nbeing hazardous, is best to be of fire-proof construction. Tanks\r\nconstructed as shown in Fig. 66, with the little neck head can be\r\nnested four in a bay and be made fully accessible on all floors.\r\n\r\nThe nesting of tanks six feet in diameter in a sixteen-foot square bay\r\nprovides sufficient strength to make it possible to suspend the tanks\r\nfrom the floor beams above, suitably arranged, it further avoids the\r\nnecessity of supports near to the tanks, which greatly facilitate\r\ncleanliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Situation of Surface Boxes.=--The grease content in the fertilizer\r\nis a matter of dollars and cents. When the oil is withdrawn from the\r\ntanks it cannot be seen and no matter how closely watched considerable\r\noil will pass through to the surface box where it can be collected.\r\nConsequently the second story of the tank house is a high story with\r\nthe surface boxes placed convenient to the second floor so as to be\r\nreadily worked. Further reference to this is made later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Press Room.=--The press room is arranged so that the press can be\r\nbuilt directly beneath the surface boxes, from whence the car is passed\r\nto the press for pressing out the moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Digesters.=--The “digester” indicated, together with its method of\r\nsuspension and nesting has been successfully used and was the practice\r\nfollowed by a well known designer for a number of years. The diameter\r\nand height of the digester ordinarily used is 6 × 16 feet on the tank\r\nbody. The writer invariably has specified half-inch thick tank steel\r\nfor the reason that the increased thickness is of so little additional\r\nweight, and the labor being such a considerable factor, that it was\r\nthought well to provide this additional thickness to take care of\r\ncorrosion and acid attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Little Neck Rendering Tank.=--Lugs can be placed in any position\r\ndesirable for support. The little neck for filling needs no comment. It\r\nis provided with a six-point security and by the use of ring-bolts with\r\nmale and female flanged closing and gasket, can readily be made steam\r\ntight.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tank Gate Valve.=--Tank department foremen are divided in ideas as to\r\nusing sliding steam gate valves, in which the gate is operated by lever\r\nfor quick opening or the screw type valve. The latter should be the\r\nrising stem type.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Surface Box.=--The surface box shown is a jacketed type used for\r\nplants where tank water is collected for evaporation. The cost of this\r\nis justified as against being annoyed with coils in the tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Press and Pump.=--Practically all presses now in use are hydraulic.\r\nThese are overhead or under types, the latter being mostly used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--SECTION OF RENDERING TANK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--DESIGN OF STEAM JACKETED SURFACE BOX.]\r\n\r\nThe style of pump used is a question of importance. The writer\r\nspecifies steam operated hydraulic pumps in preference to power\r\ndriven pumps, since the former can be operated from a governor that\r\nautomatically keeps full pressure on the pump. With the power pump,\r\nwhen the motive power is stopped, a leak, the size of a pin point, in a\r\nvalve, will cause a leakage that releases the pressure and makes poor\r\npressing. Be aware of the fact that there is no method of extracting\r\nwater from the fertilizer so cheap as pressing and the only limit\r\nshould be the strength of the cloths. Fig. 70 shows how a hydraulic\r\npress and pump should be connected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--DIAGRAM OF HYDRAULIC PRESS WITH PIPING AND\r\nPUMP.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooking Killing Stock.=--The tank should be clean; draw in about two\r\nhogsheads of water for a 6 × 16 foot tank, or a proportionate amount\r\nfor tanks of other sizes; turn on the steam to boil the water, and then\r\nbegin filling the tank. Allow sufficient steam to enter to keep the\r\ntank boiling slowly. When the tank is two-thirds full, shut off the\r\nsteam, draw off the water and refill with water; turn on the steam,\r\nbringing the contents to a boil the second time. Do not fill the\r\ntank to exceed three-fourths full, as the cooking is better done if\r\nsufficient room is left. After cooking for a half hour, draw off the\r\nwater a second time. It will be found, especially in cooking product\r\nfrom the killing department, that the water drawn off is dark colored,\r\nfrom the blood and dirt that has accumulated on the tissue. If this\r\nis not withdrawn it has the effect of darkening the lard or tallow\r\nmaterially.\r\n\r\nAfter the water has been drawn the second time, put on the tank head\r\nand turn on the steam, the condensation from the steam is sufficient\r\nto cook the material; no more water is needed. See that the blow-off\r\nand escape pipes are shut and the pet-cock is open. Continue cooking in\r\nthis manner until a moderate pressure is built up, then admit steam to\r\nfull pressure of forty-five pounds, open the escape valve just enough\r\nso that you may know the gas is escaping. At the completion of this\r\noperation the cooking begins. A tank of tallow should cook thoroughly\r\nin from nine to ten hours with forty pounds pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cold Spots._--Oftentimes freshly killed material will lie closely\r\ntogether and a “cold spot” will occur--a spot where the material has\r\nbecome partially solidified and the steam has not penetrated. In such\r\ncase, shut off the steam, draw off the water, and then turn on the\r\nsteam, the cold spots will disappear. “Cold spot” has the effect of\r\nsouring lard and tallow; in other words before the heat has penetrated\r\ninto the solid mass, the heat surrounding it will have caused it to\r\nsour. This point should be watched closely, especially in cooking lard.\r\n\r\nTankmen should try the pet-cock on the tank each half hour to find out\r\nif the tank is “flush.” If the tank is “flush” or foaming, the foam\r\nwill come out instead of steam. In this case, shut off the tank ten\r\nminutes, then draw off the water, but see that no grease is drawn off\r\nwith it. The cause of the flushing, or foaming, is that the tank is\r\ntoo full, or that there is too much water in it, consequently it is\r\nnecessary that the tankman should try his pet-cock very often during\r\nthe operation of cooking to see that the contents are being properly\r\ncooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cutting Tanks.=--Cuttings and cold products of like character are\r\nusually carried in cold water while filling, and are not parboiled as\r\ndescribed for “killing” tanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Releasing Pressure.=--When the tank is cooked, shut off the steam\r\nand open the pet-cock for about ten minutes, then the escape valve,\r\nbeing careful not to give it too much escape at first, or the tank will\r\n“roll.” By this is meant that the original heat in the oil contents\r\nwill generate steam in the contents beneath which, when the pressure\r\nis relieved, will cause the contents to boil violently, but if the\r\npressure is reduced slowly, this condition will not arise. When a tank\r\nhas “rolled” it takes a great deal more time to settle it, the grease\r\nbeing thoroughly mixed up with the residue of the tank. As the pressure\r\ndecreases the operator can increase the rapidity of release.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--DETAIL OF PIPING CONNECTIONS. TOP OF RENDERING\r\nTANK.]\r\n\r\nThe pressure being relieved from the tank, take out the head, use\r\nabout a water-pail full of fine salt to settle the tank. This salt is\r\nscattered over the contents in the tank and has the effect of settling\r\nsediment and tissue which may be held in suspension. The tank should\r\nstand about two hours to thoroughly settle before drawing the oil. Draw\r\nthe oil from the side valves of the tank into coolers. It is often\r\nnecessary, in doing this, to raise the contents of the tank, as there\r\nmay be considerable tallow or lard below the lowest draw-off valve.\r\nSuch being the case run water into the bottom of the tank sufficient to\r\nraise its contents so that all the rendered oil can be drawn through\r\nthe lowest valve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--DETAIL OF PIPING CONNECTIONS, BOTTOM OF\r\nRENDERING TANK]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Operating Tank Blow-Off.=--Descriptive of the connections for\r\noperating rendering tank connections is the following subject matter.\r\nThe exhaust connections are illustrated in drawings, Figs. 71 and 72,\r\nand essentially consist of, beginning at tank neck:\r\n\r\n(1) Spring pop safety valve set at 45 pound pressure to automatically\r\nrelease in case of excessive pressure arising and failure of weighted\r\npop valve to relieve.\r\n\r\n(2) Pressure gauge on each riser to indicate pressure on the individual\r\ntank to insure its being under pressure and under heat. The siphon bend\r\nbetween gauge and pipe is preferably filled with glycerine.\r\n\r\n(3) Try cock on bottom of drip line to open occasionally as test for\r\n“gas.”\r\n\r\n(4) Globe valve, ³⁄₈ inch, operated slightly open to allow gas to\r\nrelease from tank and create very small circulation.\r\n\r\n(5) Globe valve, 1¹⁄₂ inch; blow down valve to be used when releasing\r\nall pressure from tanks.\r\n\r\n(6) Angle type pop safety valve to relieve into the discharge line.\r\n\r\n(7) Check valve attached to the line to prevent any foaming or steam\r\nfrom an adjacent tank discharging into this unit via the exhaust system.\r\n\r\n(8) Exhaust header used in conjunction with the system to collect all\r\ngases and steam discharged from the battery of tanks.\r\n\r\n(9) Cooking connections: It is preferable to drill the inlet nozzle at\r\nbottom of tank at the lowest point possible and to admit steam on two\r\nsides of nozzle not opposite but on an angle as shown in plan. This\r\nprevents “dancing” tanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Check Valves._--Check valves are placed in the admission valve to\r\nprevent floaters or foreign materials entering lines and stopping the\r\ncontrol valves and steam and water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inlet Header._--For usual purposes steam and water are admitted into\r\nthe tank at one point and steam at one, see _Nos. 12-a_ and _12-b_ on\r\ndiagram. If tank water is being collected and evaporated, line _12-c_\r\nis introduced and used as follows:\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the use of _12-b_ is for admitting water into bottom of\r\ntank in case the oil line after tank contents are cooked and settled\r\nare below the draw cocks.\r\n\r\nIn the event tank water is being saved to avoid weakening tank water\r\nby introduction of cold clean water, this result is accomplished by\r\npumping tank water into the tank via the connection _12-c_. If tank\r\nwater is not being evaporated, _12-c_ line and connection is omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Draw Down Pipe._--If the oil is high and water appears at the\r\ndraw-cocks _14_ and _15_, then the content is lowered by opening cock\r\n_No. 13_ and lowering the body as much as required.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oil Draw Cocks, 14 and 15._--When the tank is cooked, oil settled and\r\nthe tank raised or lowered by use of _No. 12_ connections or _No. 13_\r\ncock, the oil belt should be such that the bottom of it is about on a\r\nline with cock _14_, and the main body of oil is drawn through cock\r\n_No. 15_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Surface Box Treatment.=--After the oil is drawn out of the tank, the\r\nresidue is dumped into the surface box. Anything that has not been\r\nthoroughly cooked will float on top in the vat. These floaters should\r\nall be skimmed off and put back into the tank to be re-cooked. The\r\ncontents should be thoroughly agitated with a pole or rake, cooked\r\nfifteen minutes, allowed to settle and the oil carefully skimmed off.\r\nThis should be done two or three times on each vat so as to free all\r\nthe oil possible.\r\n\r\nIf tank water is being collected the boiling is done by steam jacket on\r\nthe box; if not, by direct application of free live steam. In either\r\ncase stir contents freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pressing Tankage.=--As soon as the operation of the skimming of the\r\nvat has been thoroughly accomplished the contents are in the proper\r\ncondition to be pressed and should be handled while still hot. The\r\nwater is mostly drained off. In building the cakes, a portable car is\r\nrun under the surface box. By the use of a quick opening lever gate the\r\ncontents are dropped in quantity desired upon a press cloth; between\r\neach cheese is placed a rack--the process being thus, a rack made of 1\r\n× ¹⁄₄ inch material, usually elm, thoroughly nailed together, is first\r\nlaid on the press head; next a frame of the size and depth required to\r\nhandle the product is used. This frame should not exceed two inches in\r\ndepth. The press cloth is then spread over them and the material drawn\r\nonto the press. Well spread out, the cloth is carefully folded over the\r\ntop of it. The form is then lifted off the press, another press rack is\r\nput on top of the cheese already made, and the process repeated. Ten or\r\ntwelve plates are usually used to a press.\r\n\r\nAfter the car is filled it is placed in the hydraulic press and\r\npressure applied. This should be done slowly at first, giving the water\r\nample time to run out of the press. If the pressure is applied too\r\nrapidly the tendency is for the material to slide out on one side or\r\nthe other, but if the water is pressed out slowly the material adheres\r\nbetter or gets a good “bond,” so that it will not slip.\r\n\r\nAfter the press has run until the cakes are about one-half of their\r\noriginal thickness spray with hot water, thoroughly washing off the\r\nsides of the press, turn on more pressure until this reaches about\r\n300 tons on a 5 × 5 foot plate. It will be found that it is the last\r\npressing which brings out the grease.\r\n\r\nWhere tankage is properly handled it should run from six to eight per\r\ncent of residual grease on a dry basis. Where improperly handled it\r\nwill oftentimes run from eighteen to twenty per cent, the excess being\r\nlard or tallow which should have been saved, but worthless if left in\r\ntankage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Treatment of Lard and Tallow.=--As the oils are being withdrawn from\r\nthe rendering tanks the same should be passed through a small over-flow\r\ntype of catch tank arranged so that the oils pass through a straining\r\nsystem to remove fibre or floaters. From the above basin the oils\r\nshould be passed to the receivers or coolers preparatory to settling.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment of the writer these tanks should preferably be in\r\na department or room separated from the rendering department, to\r\navoid possibility of contact and absorbing odors. The receivers or\r\nreservoirs should be circular in form with a coil of heating pipe\r\narranged, supported from the sides of the kettles. The pipe should be\r\nsufficiently spread to allow perfect cleaning.\r\n\r\nThe cones on the bottom should be at an angle of 45° so as to collect\r\nthe sediment, water or scrap that may deposit in small volume. The\r\nscrap should be settled out and removed daily. Tallow and lard should\r\nbe allowed to cool to a tiercing temperature and kept in as large\r\nvolume as conditions permit, so as to obtain uniformity in cooler.\r\n\r\nIn case of lard, killing and cutting lard should be intimately mixed in\r\nequal proportions if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Titer in Tallow and Lard.=--Titer in tallow, frequently referred to,\r\nis a relative test of hardness. The test was originally devised for\r\nthe use of candle makers who wanted an oil containing the largest\r\npercentage of stearic acid. Stearic acid has a hardness of about 55°\r\nCentigrade. The hardness of other substances is relative to this as\r\nfollows: commercial oleo stearine, about 50.5° C.; tallow, 41° to 43°\r\nC.; No. 2 tallow or grease, 39° to 43° C.; P. S. lard, 35.5° to 37° C.\r\nEvery trimming in the animal has a different hardness; the thinner the\r\ncattle, the harder the tallow. Bone fat or marrow is very soft. Animals\r\nof different feeding show varying hardness, so there is no method of\r\nmanufacture that will vary the hardness content of product other than\r\nselection. In a general way, cattle ruffle, caul, or that used usually\r\nin oleo melting is relatively hard. For example, oleo stock will\r\nanalyze as hard as 46° C., while the tallow from the same house will\r\nanalyze 43° C.\r\n\r\nThis hardness is determined in the chemical laboratory as follows: The\r\nfat is melted and 25 cubic centimeters are drawn and mixed with 20 C.\r\nC. wood alcohol, 10 C. C. of 50° Baume caustic soda solution and the\r\ncontents boiled until completely saponified. The alcohol is evaporated\r\nby drying. The residue is ground and boiled with an excess of diluted\r\nsulphuric acid until all the soap has been changed to fatty acid and\r\nthe clear oil floats. The water in the vessel is drawn from below the\r\nfat, and the fatty acids collected in a glass vessel, which are allowed\r\nto stand on steam coils until the oily stratum is clearly defined.\r\nThe fatty acids are placed in an observation room and the point of\r\nsolidification observed. The result is the titer, which is the degree\r\nCentigrade at which the fatty acid from an oil or stearine solidifies\r\nafter being melted.\r\n\r\nThe other item of consequence in tallow analysis is the rancidity,\r\nknown as the free fatty acid. This should be kept low and is usually\r\nvariable with the care given the product. No. 1 tallow, for example,\r\nshould show under two per cent of low grade greases, and will run as\r\nhigh as twenty per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Steam for Cooking.=--A question frequently asked is the quantity of\r\nsteam required to cook a tank. An accurate test conducted on a mixed\r\ntank of pork products, killing and cutting stock, under standard\r\nconditions showed thus:\r\n\r\n  Weight of Raw Stock                        12,266\r\n  Water filled in Tank                        9,634\r\n                                             ------\r\n                                             21,900\r\n  After Cooking:--\r\n    Lard                              6,040\r\n    Skimmings                           479\r\n    Water Tankage                    19,360\r\n                                             25,879\r\n                                     --------------\r\n  Accumulation-Steam Condensed                3,979\r\n  Steam per 1,000 pounds, Raw Stock             324 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooking Test and Expense.=--The following test on the cost for cooking\r\nwas made on killing and cutting lard--very large digesters--and from\r\nit valuable deductions can be made.

They can be operated so as not to\r\nbecome a nuisance. To do this requires:\r\n\r\n(1) Ample tanks with no neglect about promptly rendering all products\r\nand reducing them to lard, tallow or dry fertilizer.\r\n\r\n(2) Collecting and evaporating all tank waters.\r\n\r\n(3) Drying of tankage done under vacuum or otherwise controlling odors.\r\n\r\n(4) Catch basins under cover, skimmed frequently and contents cooked\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n(5) The rendering department kept tightly closed and department\r\noperated with forced draft, all discharged air passed through large\r\nwater-wash, and the introduction into the air of gas boiled from tar\r\noil.\r\n\r\n(6) All tank exhaust and vapors connected to a piping system, the steam\r\ncondensed by water spray, and the vapor collected and passed under\r\nfurnaces of boilers.\r\n\r\n(7) Keep everything hot, allow nothing to lay around and sour.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Catch Basin.=--Every packing house needs an adequate catch basin\r\nsystem. Local basins established in departments near to points where\r\nproducts are handled, serve to collect many fats and oils that, by\r\nclean handling, are edible products, and can be used as such.\r\n\r\nWhere melted fats are produced cold water sprays should be introduced\r\nto coagulate the oils. Wiers for over and under-flow should be put in\r\nto retard flow and submerge particles so they may harden and float. A\r\nlarge general basin should be introduced so that all outflowing sewers\r\ncan be passed to them, to the end that all water flows slowly through\r\nthe basin to catch any and all particles of floating fats or meats.\r\n\r\nThe basins should be placed under the care and jurisdiction of one\r\nperson, who should see that they are kept clean and frequently skimmed.\r\nIt is to good purpose to place them under roof so they will have\r\nattention at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTANK WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOIL FERTILITY -- ANIMAL FEEDING -- TANK WATER -- SEPARATION OF\r\n  SOLIDS -- COLLECTING GREASE -- TESTING TANK WATER -- EVAPORATING TANK\r\n  WATER -- DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS -- CLEANING EVAPORATORS -- TABLE OF\r\n  BOILING POINTS -- TESTING STICK -- COPPERAS IN WATER TO EVAPORATE --\r\n  SOLIDS IN WATER -- DRYING STICK -- VALUE OF TANKAGE -- QUANTITY OF\r\n  TANK WATER -- COST OF EVAPORATING.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Soil Fertility.=--The constant drain on the soil by raising of grain;\r\nfeeding animals and sending them away for slaughter, and the non-return\r\nof the nitrogen element has made great inroads on the productivity\r\nof soil. Through volume after volume and in every manner possible,\r\neconomic writers are impressing this upon the agricultural interests\r\nand advocating the making up of such deficit by rotating crops, turning\r\nunder legume and plants that might extract nitrogen from the air by the\r\nprocesses of nature which daily are becoming more familiar to every\r\none. Value and demand for the nitrogenous elements for this purpose has\r\ncaused the packer to exercise all possible care to produce and conserve\r\nfor sale any and all nitrogenous products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Animal Feeding.=--Experiment has also shown that nitrogenous products\r\nhave a very high value as a nutritive food for growing and fattening\r\nanimals, so much so in fact, that in many agricultural districts the\r\nentire output of tankage from local packing houses is now sold in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood for stock foods. Under various names evaporated\r\ntank water is an ingredient of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tank Water.=--Invisible but in considerable quantity, nitrogenous\r\nsolids were formerly lost in the various waters from cooking, but\r\nthey are now collected and reduced to a semi-solid, or solid form.\r\nThese are classified under the one broad name of tank water, but they\r\ninclude almost any water in which animal matter is cooked unless the\r\nwater be of such character that it can be used for edible purposes. The\r\nchief sources of supply are rendering tank water, blood water, bone\r\nhouse cooking water, ham and tripe boiling water, etc. It is estimated\r\nthat any water showing density of ¹⁄₂° Beaume scale is worthy of\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Keeping Water Concentrated._--Evidently the more dilute the water,\r\nthe more water it is necessary to evaporate, and hence more costly to\r\nconcentrate. In raising the tanks so as to flow the oil from the tank\r\ncocks, it is necessary at times to admit fresh water. To avoid this\r\nthe water from one tank is usually transferred to another of the same\r\ncharacter by use of a pump.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collection of Waters._--After the tankage has been dumped into the\r\nskimming box and all grease skimmed off, the tank water should be drawn\r\ninto a separate vat. The “press water,” which is the water from the\r\npressing of the tankage, should also be collected. The floor drainage\r\nexcept from the tank filling floor, and practically all water produced\r\nin the tank house, should be collected; in fact, some operators go to\r\nthe extreme of not connecting the tank house sewer system to the city\r\nsewer so as to intentionally preclude the wasting of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparation of Solids.=--The tank water is collected in large vats for\r\nprocessing. The solids or sludge is undesirable to handle, consequently\r\nin draining the tank water from the surface vats into the storage,\r\nit is necessary to have the holes of the screens in the surface vats\r\nreduced to about one-quarter of an inch in size in order that all of\r\nthe solids will be retained in the surface vats and not be permitted to\r\ngo into the tank water catch basins.\r\n\r\nThe tank water storage vats should be equal to a day’s capacity and\r\nshould be filled in rotation in order that agitation will be going on\r\nonly in the vat being filled or the vat being emptied, and that the\r\nwater in the balance of the storage vats will be permitted to be held\r\nunder a settling process in the meantime, which is as follows: Heat\r\nthe water to a temperature of 180° to 185° F., and then allow it to\r\ndrop down to 170° F., carrying it at this temperature from eight to\r\ntwenty-four hours, according to the length of time it is possible to\r\ncarry the water for settling purposes, up to 36 hours is an advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Collecting Grease.=--In the surface boxes spoken of in preceding\r\nchapter, it is very essential to agitate the tankage in the surface\r\nvats and keep it under steam long enough for some of the grease to rise\r\nto the top of the surface boxes and be skimmed off before the tank\r\nwater is run into the storage vats. Skim the grease very carefully from\r\nthe top of the water in any vat that is to be used for evaporation;\r\nthen pump the water to the evaporator supply tank. After the water is\r\npumped out of the basin, it will be necessary to remove the bottom of\r\nsettlings each time after the tank is emptied.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Settlings in Bottom of Vat.=--Pump the bottoms from the holding tanks\r\ninto a surface box from which these settings are passed on to the press\r\ncheeses with pressed tankage, so that the fibrous material will collect\r\nthe sludge. It is absolutely necessary that these settlings be taken\r\nout of the storage vats each time the vats are emptied in order to keep\r\nthem sweet and to prevent the tank water from souring as it certainly\r\nwill, unless cleaned at least twice a week. It is much better to clean\r\nthem every time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Testing Tank Water.=--Tank water is tested with a standard hydrometer\r\nfor liquids heavier than water, and as stated previously, any water\r\nindicating ¹⁄₂° on the Beaume scale, is collected.\r\n\r\nA sample of the tank water is cooled to 150° F. Drop a hydrometer\r\ninto the water and take reading at a point on a level with the\r\nwater; a hydrometer reading from 1 to 20, is used for this purpose.\r\nIf hydrometer reads 2.00, the amount of the solids in the water is\r\nestimated at 3.83 per cent as shown on the table for figuring tank\r\nwater. If the hydrometer should read 2.50, the estimated solids is\r\none-half of the difference between solids shown on table at 2° Beaume\r\nand 3° Beaume added to solids at 2° Beaume which is 4.80 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Evaporating Tank Water.=--The evaporating of tank water, it is\r\nproposed to do in the most economical manner possible, and advantage\r\nis taken of the fact that as the pressure is lowered the boiling point\r\nis reduced. For example, water at atmospheric pressure and sea level\r\nboils at 212° F., and water under a twenty-eight inch vacuum boils at\r\n100° F. Advantage is taken of these physical facts in the evaporating\r\nof tank water.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of types of evaporators using the same principle,\r\nalthough we show one only, that which is most extensively used, the\r\nwell-known Swenson machine. This apparatus consists of one, two or\r\nthree cells, dependent upon the economy it is wanted to attain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--SWENSON EVAPORATOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Descriptive of the Apparatus.=--The cells are numbered _1_, _2_ and\r\n_3_, beginning at the left. The rectangular box at the bottom of each\r\ncell consists of a cast iron false head or chamber at either end, in\r\nwhich copper flues are expanded. Steam is introduced into the chamber\r\nof _No. 1_, and the tubes surrounded with tank water. The steam in the\r\ncoils causes the water to boil and the steam boiled off is passed to\r\nthe steam chamber of the second cell. The tank water in cell _No. 1_\r\nby this boiling is condensed and is passed to cell _No. 2_, where a\r\nfurther boiling takes place, and the concentrated liquid is passed to\r\ncell _No. 3_ for its last boiling.\r\n\r\nThe auxiliary pumps shown are for transfer purposes from cell to cell,\r\nand for pumping the condensate from the steam chambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vacuum._--The large pump at the right hand is the vacuum pump. The\r\nvapor withdrawn from cell _No. 3_ by the withdrawal action of the\r\npump is condensed by the introduction of cold water in the conical\r\nenlargement shown. This condensation produces a partial vacuum, the\r\ncustomary gauge measurement showing 23 to 27 inches, dependent upon\r\nthe quantity and temperature of the water. This vacuum continues in\r\na lesser degree to the second cell, thence to the first and where\r\nthe vacuum usually maintained is six inches. By reference to the\r\ntable of boiling points the comparative temperature in each cell is\r\nascertainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cleaning the Evaporators.=--Evaporators to be effective must be clean,\r\non the same principle as cleaning boilers produce best results. At\r\nregular intervals, say, fortnightly, they should be boiled out with a\r\nsolution of 75 lbs. caustic soda in 1500 gallons of water. This will\r\nclean the flues and maintain the machine output.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF BOILING POINTS.\r\n\r\n  29 inch vacuum   79.07° Fahr.\r\n  28 inch vacuum  101.15  Fahr.\r\n  27 inch vacuum  115.06  Fahr.\r\n  26 inch vacuum  125.38  Fahr.\r\n  25 inch vacuum  133.77  Fahr.\r\n  24 inch vacuum  140.64  Fahr.\r\n  23 inch vacuum  146.78  Fahr.\r\n  22 inch vacuum  152.16  Fahr.\r\n  21 inch vacuum  157.00  Fahr.\r\n  20 inch vacuum  161.42  Fahr.\r\n  19 inch vacuum  165.42  Fahr.\r\n  18 inch vacuum  169.14  Fahr.\r\n  17 inch vacuum  172.63  Fahr.\r\n  16 inch vacuum  175.93  Fahr.\r\n  15 inch vacuum  179.03  Fahr.\r\n  14 inch vacuum  181.92  Fahr.\r\n  13 inch vacuum  184.68  Fahr.\r\n  12 inch vacuum  187.31  Fahr.\r\n  11 inch vacuum  189.83  Fahr.\r\n  10 inch vacuum  192.43  Fahr.\r\n   5 inch vacuum  202.92  Fahr.\r\n   1 inch vacuum  212     Fahr.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Storing Stick.=--The residue from the evaporators or the “Stick” as it\r\nis now called, should be pumped into a receptacle fitted with closed\r\nsteam coils. The tank water vats are similarly fitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Testing Stick.=--Stick is tested the same as tank water, excepting a\r\nhydrometer graduated from 20° to 40° is used. It is usual to evaporate\r\nto a density of 29° Beaume, which is 64.61 per cent dry solid. To\r\ncalculate the quantity of concentrated or dry stick containing 4 per\r\ncent moisture produced from 29° Beaume stick, multiply the number of\r\ngallons of stick by 10.27 lbs. to get weight of 29° Beaume stick; then\r\ntake 64.61 per cent of this weight, which is weight of dry solids, then\r\nadd 4 per cent moisture to this amount by dividing the weight of dry\r\nsolids by .96; the result is weight of concentrated tankage containing\r\n4 per cent moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Copperas.=--This is usually “sulphate of iron” of commerce, although\r\nsome institutions make their supply thus: Using a lead-lined vat\r\nholding about 200 gallons; into this put about 160 gallons of 60-degree\r\nsulphuric acid, adding water enough to make the solution about 12°\r\nBeaume. Into this solution place scrap iron of any description and\r\nallow it to stand until the solution will dissolve no more iron.\r\nPump the solution into a shallow lead-lined vat with lead coils, and\r\nevaporate to about 40° degrees Beaume. It is next drawn off into\r\nbarrels of fifty gallons each and to each barrel add forty pounds of\r\nblack oxide of manganese and thoroughly mix.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Copperas in Water to Evaporate.=--An early practice and one which had\r\nthe merit of fixing free ammonia before it passes off in a gaseous form\r\nwas the introduction of copperas in tank water, while settling, and\r\nbefore evaporation. The vats of tank water are tested with a Beaume\r\nhydrometer and for every 2,000 gallons of tank water at indicated\r\ndegree, Beaume, ordinary commercial copperas should be added as follows:\r\n\r\n  Water testing 5°    Baume  166 lbs. dry copperas\r\n  Water testing 4¹⁄₂° Baume  150 lbs. dry copperas\r\n  Water testing 4°    Baume  133 lbs. dry copperas\r\n  Water testing 3¹⁄₂° Baume  117 lbs. dry copperas\r\n  Water testing 3°    Baume  100 lbs. dry copperas\r\n\r\nThese varying amounts of copperas are put into a barrel of hot water\r\nand thoroughly stirred until dissolved. The solution is then poured\r\ninto a vat of tank water, the mass allowed to stand six or eight\r\nhours, and then skimmed off before being pumped to the evaporating\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Solids in Water.=--The percentage of solids and liquids, as well as\r\nthe respective weights in tank water at different degrees Beaume, are\r\nshown in the following table:\r\n\r\nTABLE FOR TANK WATER.\r\n\r\n  =======+======+=====+======+======\r\n         |      |     |Weight|\r\n         | Per  | Per |  of  |Weight\r\n  Degrees| cent | cent| cubic|  of\r\n   Baume |solids|water| foot |gallon\r\n  -------+------+-----+------+------\r\n     1   |  1.90|98.10| 62.14|  8.30\r\n     2   |  3.83|96.17| 62.46|  8.34\r\n     3   |  5.77|94.23| 62.79|  8.39\r\n     4   |  7.77|92.23| 63.11|  8.43\r\n     5   |  9.85|90.15| 63.43|  8.47\r\n     6   | 11.93|88.07| 63.91|  8.54\r\n     7   | 14.04|85.96| 64.41|  8.60\r\n     8   | 16.19|83.81| 64.89|  8.67\r\n     9   | 18.38|81.62| 65.38|  8.73\r\n    10   | 20.60|79.40| 65.81|  8.80\r\n    11   | 22.71|77.29| 66.39|  8.87\r\n    12   | 24.84|75.16| 66.92|  8.94\r\n    13   | 26.97|73.03| 67.44|  9.01\r\n    14   | 29.11|70.89| 67.97|  9.08\r\n    15   | 31.27|68.73| 68.49|  9.15\r\n    16   | 33.55|66.45| 69.05|  9.23\r\n    17   | 35.88|64.12| 69.61|  9.30\r\n    18   | 38.22|61.78| 70.17|  9.37\r\n    19   | 40.59|59.41| 70.72|  9.45\r\n    20   | 42.98|57.02| 71.28|  9.52\r\n    21   | 45.11|54.89| 71.89|  9.60\r\n    22   | 47.24|52.76| 72.79|  9.68\r\n    23   | 49.37|50.63| 73.09|  9.77\r\n    24   | 51.50|48.50| 73.70|  9.85\r\n    25   | 53.63|46.37| 74.30|  9.93\r\n    26   | 56.31|43.69| 74.95| 10.01\r\n    27   | 59.04|40.96| 75.60| 10.10\r\n    28   | 61.80|38.20| 76.25| 10.19\r\n    29   | 64.61|35.39| 76.90| 10.27\r\n    30   | 67.54|32.46| 77.55| 10.36\r\n    31   | 70.34|29.66| 78.35| 10.46\r\n    32   | 73.27|26.73| 78.94| 10.55\r\n    33   | 76.24|23.76| 79.64| 10.64\r\n    34   | 79.25|20.75| 80.33| 10.73\r\n    35   | 83.21|17.79| 81.00| 10.83\r\n  -------+------+-----+------+------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drying 29° Beaume Stick.=--This is done in two ways, by the use of\r\ndrying rolls and by mixing with drying tankage in a rotary dryer.\r\nWhen drying stick over the rolls, evaporate it in the evaporators to\r\n26° Beaume and mix with this 26° Beaume stick, about 17 per cent of\r\ncopperas before putting the mixture over the rolls. This has a tendency\r\nto prevent the concentrated tankage from absorbing moisture when in\r\nstorage. Many operators dry stick without the use of copperas, but the\r\ncopperas prevents in a measure the stick absorbing moisture from the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stick Rolls._--Fig. 74 shows a standard twin stick roll. This\r\nequipment is made of two cast iron rolls built when new to sustain\r\n50 lbs. pressure. The stick is deposited in a pan beneath and the\r\nrevolving roll collects a film of substance which is dried as the roll\r\nrevolves and is sliced from the surface of the roll by a close fitting\r\nscraper, being removed in a powdered form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--STANDARD TWIN STICK ROLL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying with Tankage._--The practice now generally adopted is the\r\nmixing of the stick with tankage and drying in the standard fertilizer\r\ndryer, using a fifteen foot dryer with stationary shell and revolving\r\nshaft, with arms cylindrical type, usually known as the “Smith” dryer.\r\nThe usual charge is 4,000 lbs. pressed tankage and 1,200 lbs. stick,\r\nagitating while the stick is being admitted so as to assist in equal\r\nmixing. The stick should be at a temperature of 190° F., or near\r\nthereto when used. The heated substance seems to produce less tailings,\r\nor small balls requiring milling.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Value of Tankage.=--To appreciate the value of the substances to be\r\ncollected in this manner, we refer to copy of test, made by an expert,\r\non a plant handling about 5,000 cattle and 5,000 hogs per week, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nESTIMATE OF THE PRODUCTION AND VALUE OF TANKAGE MADE BY EVAPORATING\r\nTANK WATER.\r\n\r\nTEST FOR AMOUNT OF WATER DRAINED OFF VATS BEFORE PULLING TANKAGE.\r\n\r\n  =======+=======================================+=======+=======\r\n         |                                       |       |  Av.\r\n  Tank   |                 Product               |Gallons|gallons\r\n  -------+---------------------------------------+-------+-------\r\n  No.  1 |Prime tallow (cutting room bones, etc.)| 1,445 |\r\n  No.  1 |Prime tallow (cutting room bones, etc.)| 1,734 | 1,589\r\n         |                                       +-------+\r\n  No.  2 |Prime tallow (bed fat, etc.)           | 1,645 |\r\n  No.  2 |Prime tallow (bed fat, etc.)           | 1,365 |\r\n  No.  3 |Prime tallow (bed fat, etc.)           | 1,426 |\r\n  No.  3 |Prime tallow (bed fat, etc.)           | 1,827 | 1,566\r\n         |                                       +-------+\r\n  No.  4 |No. 2 tallow (catch basin stuff)       |   668 |\r\n  No.  6 |Pluck tank                             |   905 |\r\n  No.  9 |Pluck tank                             |   562 |\r\n  No. 10 |Pluck tank                             |   624 |\r\n  No. 10 |Pluck tank                             |   847 |   735\r\n         |                                       +-------+\r\n  No. 11 |Prime steam lard                       | 1,382 |\r\n  No. 11 |Prime steam lard                       | 1,248 | 1,315\r\n         |                                       +-------+\r\n  -------+---------------------------------------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nTOTAL NUMBER OF TIMES TANKS FILLED AND COOKED.\r\n\r\n                                         No.\r\n          Product.

In nearly every\r\ninstance this is collected at a given point near the sticking rails and\r\ntransferred to the fertilizer department for processing.\r\n\r\nIt is rather difficult to pump blood, although it can be readily\r\ndone with a ball valve pump, or a centrifugal pump. The latter is\r\nsatisfactory if foreign substances can be kept out, and if the\r\nreservoir can be situated high enough so that the blood can gravitate\r\nto the suction of the pump. Mechanical agitation is a benefit in\r\nthe receivers. A very satisfactory way to handle blood is by means\r\nof a blow tank. This is a tight, heavily constructed cylinder with\r\nan admittance valve on the inlet pipe, and a closing valve on the\r\ndischarge pipe; the latter preferably a quick opening valve. A means\r\nfor admitting air or steam to the blood is arranged. To operate, the\r\nvalve on the inlet line as well as the outlet valve is closed, and air\r\nor steam pressure is built up as required for the lift. The outlet\r\nvalve is then quickly opened when the contents of the tank is virtually\r\n“shot” to the receiving tanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Receiving Tank.=--This is preferably a closed type of tank with an air\r\nvent to allow displacement of air when blowing blood. It is preferably\r\nsituated above the cook tank with an admittance valve between them so\r\nthat blood can be lowered to the cooking tank at will.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooking.=--Blood should be “_baked_,” not boiled. By this is meant,\r\nthe steam should be admitted slowly and the heat dispersed through the\r\nmass rather than boiled violently, by admitting high pressure steam.\r\nThe blood, by this method, seems to coagulate in larger grains, and,\r\nin pressing, a larger proportion is retained in the cloths, while the\r\nserum or white water draining away is of a lighter color, with the net\r\nresult that the yield of blood is better.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pressing.=--The pressing is performed in the same manner as described\r\nfor tankage, except that the material is handled dry. The waters from\r\ncooking, as well as from pressing, are saved for evaporation as tank\r\nwater. Blood when pressed properly is “caked.” It should be broken up\r\nbefore being passed to the dryers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Purity.=--Means should be provided and arrangements made to keep\r\nall raw or fluid blood free from water and manure. Frequently cattle\r\nthat are hay or grass fed, have a draining from the stomach via the\r\nmouth when hung, and comparatively large quantities of undigested food\r\nare spilled. This should be collected before the animal is stuck and\r\nprevented from mixing with the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Storing.=--After drying, blood should be cooled and stored in piles on\r\nthe floor in dry rooms to be put in bags at the time of shipment. It\r\nis usually unnecessary to grind or screen it. It should be dried to 8%\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quick Handling.=--Blood is so highly susceptible to decay that it\r\nshould be handled quickly and with as little contact with air as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tankage.=--This name embodies the dried material from the residue in\r\nthe tanks after cooking in digesters, and pressing. It is classified\r\ninto several grades. Digester tankage, is usually sold for stock\r\nfoods. No. 1 tankage of commerce, has a high nitrogen content and low\r\npercentage of bone, it is usually produced from beef tanks; No. 2\r\ntankage is low in nitrogen or ammonia, as it is known to the lay-mind,\r\nand high in bone. The usual comparative analysis is:\r\n\r\n                  Blood    No. 1  No. 2\r\n  Bone Phosphate   ...       10%    28%\r\n  Ammonia         16-17%  10-12%   6-8%\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quotations and Values.=--Tankage and blood is usually sold on its\r\nvalue per unit of ammonia. That is to say, if blood be quoted at\r\n$3.00 per unit of ammonia and analyzes sixteen per cent, it sells for\r\n$48.00 per ton. Tankage may contain eleven per cent ammonia and twelve\r\nper cent bone phosphate, quoted at $2.75 per unit, and 10c per unit\r\nrespectively, which would make the relative market $31.45 per ton.\r\n\r\nBy reference to market quotations it will be noted usually that the\r\nlower the ammonia content, the lower the price per unit of ammonia,\r\nconsequently it behooves the maker to produce all the No. 1 tankage\r\npossible, and this is accomplished by cooking bone as raw bone and\r\nseparately--in preference to tanking it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grease.=--Grease in fertilizers or dried tankage is a positive\r\ndetriment. It is useless and valueless, consequently the point to be\r\nstriven for is to lower the percentage of grease to the minimum. The\r\nbest methods known are described under tanking. Some packers doing\r\nbusiness on a large scale have “degreasing” plants where the grease\r\nis extracted by naphtha process, but, this is a highly specialized\r\ndepartment and not desirable in a small plant. By careful attention the\r\ngrease can be lowered to eight per cent on dry basis analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Influence of Stick.=--The use of stick in tankage drying adds greatly\r\nto the average ammonia content. Dried stick separately analyzed yields\r\n15¹⁄₂ per cent ammonia, greatly increasing the value of the product in\r\nwhich it is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Digester Tankage.=--This is a general name for the product sold to pig\r\nfeeders for providing a nitrogenous element in their feeding. State\r\nAgricultural Departments and packers have been conducting campaigns\r\nfor years introducing this as a feed. It is usually a No. 1 tankage\r\nmade from freshly killed material and promptly dried. It is supposed to\r\ncontain a stated protein content, which is really a multiple or unit\r\nbased upon its nitrogen content, 5.137 being the factor. Stick is used\r\nin the digester tankage and with benefit provided it is kept sweet.\r\n\r\nIn hog producing localities practically the entire output of tankage\r\ncan be disposed of to the farmer for stock food purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Slime.=--The slime scraped from intestines in the casing department\r\nhas a high ammonia value and should be collected and cooked in a manner\r\nsimilar to the method used in cooking blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drying.=--This operation consists of extracting the moisture from the\r\ntankage by means of air which is used as a vehicle to carry away the\r\nmoisture. Various devices are employed for performing this function,\r\nsuch as barometric condensers, siphon tees, pipe condensers, and fan\r\nwith air wash tower. There is some objection to all of these types, and\r\neach operator usually has some home-made device based upon experience.\r\nThe fan is the more logical; it sweeps a large volume of air through\r\nthe dryer by withdrawing it and passing it to the wash tower. The air\r\ncarries away the moisture. To dry cheaply have a positive circulation\r\nof air through the dryer by keeping the inlet open, the fan attached to\r\nthe air outlet connection. Single or multiple of dryers can be arranged\r\non one fan.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dryers.=--The principal apparatus in the fertilizer department is the\r\ndryer. Of these there are several types.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Direct Fire Dryers._--In direct fire dryers, the tankage and flame\r\nproduced by the use of oil, coke or coal, are introduced and passed\r\nthrough a cylindrical rotating machine similar to a cement dryer. The\r\ndried tankage is discharged at the opposite end from the feed, and the\r\ngases and moisture pass through a water spray and chimney to the air.\r\nIt is practically impossible to operate a dryer of this type without\r\nproducing an offensive odor in the surrounding territory and they are\r\nalso considered hazardous from a fire standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Smith Type._--This type of dryer is shown in the illustration (Fig.\r\n75) and is of the steam jacketed type. The barrel is stationary with\r\na revolving shaft and extended arms carrying the tankage upward which\r\nfalls back through the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ord Type._--This dryer is also illustrated, Fig. 76, and is of the\r\nsame type, except that the shaft is placed vertical and the revolving\r\narms at right angle to the shaft device which accomplishes the same\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--ILLUSTRATING THE SMITH TYPE OF DRYER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--SHOWING THE ORD TYPE OF DRYER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Expense for Drying.=--In a charge type of machine where batches are\r\nplaced in the machine and unit lots dried, the expense for drying\r\nseems to be per short ton, about as follows: Labor, $1.25 to $2.00;\r\nDryer repairs, $0.75 to $1.25; Steam, variable. The item of steam is\r\nquite a large factor. In a well handled equipment, properly insulated,\r\nabout ³⁄₄ of a pound of moisture can be extracted per pound of steam\r\ncondensed in the jacket, when drying tankage, and ⁶⁄₁₀ of a pound\r\nwhen drying blood. The latter requires about twice as long to dry as\r\ntankage; in other words, the output per hour of dryer operation is\r\nabout one-half.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Commercial Fertilizer.=--Commercial Fertilizer is the name generally\r\napplied to prepared or diluted mixtures thought to be best adapted\r\nfor use on ground or for some special crop. The standard tankage as\r\nproduced contains an ammonia content of from eight to twelve per\r\ncent and may be short in other ingredients such as potash and acid\r\nphosphate, which are mineral substances, usually converted to a form\r\nreadily soluble, or in condition to be assimilated. Also the ammonia\r\ncontent is reduced to a moderation, the dilution being accomplished by\r\nthe use of a filler, such as pulverized dried peaty soil, which has\r\nthe advantage of carrying a certain quantity of humus or selected sand\r\nwhich serves a drill nicely.\r\n\r\n\r\n=State Regulations.=--Most states have found it desirable to protect\r\nthe purchaser by insisting that an analysis of the fertilizer be\r\nsupplied with each shipment, indicating the content, the state then\r\nmaking sporadic analyses to see that it generally qualifies to the\r\nstated contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mixing Materials.=--The mixing materials used are:\r\n\r\nDried Tankage.\r\n\r\nDried Blood.\r\n\r\nBone Meal.\r\n\r\nSteam Bone.\r\n\r\nAcid phosphates, which is phosphate rock treated with sulphuric\r\nacid--a more or less complicated process--and which product is usually\r\npurchased by small works.\r\n\r\nMuriate of potash, a substance known as kainit usually produced from\r\nmines in Germany, although some potash is being produced from sea weed\r\nin America.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Conversion Factors.=--The following table will be found handy for\r\nchanging the bone quantity into another term, as for example, wishing\r\nto know the per cent of nitrogen if ammonia be expressed:\r\n\r\nCONVERSION FACTORS\r\n\r\n                                              Multiply by\r\n      A                   B                 A to B    B to A\r\n  Nitrogen            Ammonia               1.2158     .8225\r\n  Nitrogen            Nitrate of Soda       6.0678     .1648\r\n  Nitrogen            Nitrate of Potash     7.2170     .1386\r\n  Nitrogen            Protein               6.2500     .1600\r\n  Ammonia             Nitrate of Soda       4.9906     .2004\r\n  Ammonia             Nitrate of Potash     5.9358     .1685\r\n  Ammonia             Protein               5.1404     .1945\r\n  Ammonia             Sulphate of Ammonia   3.8791     .2578\r\n  Nitrate of Soda     Nitrate of Potash     1.1894     .8408\r\n  Actual Potash       Muriate of Potash     1.5830     .6317\r\n  Actual Potash       Sulfate of Potash     1.8500     .5405\r\n  Actual Potash       Nitrate of Potash     2.1467     .4658\r\n  Actual Potash       Carbonate of Potash   1.4671     .6816\r\n  Muriate of Potash   Sulphate of Potash    1.1687     .8557\r\n  Muriate of Potash   Carbonate of Potash    .9268    1.0790\r\n  Phosphoric Acid     Bone Phos. of Lime    2.1850     .4577\r\n  Carbonic Acid       Carbonate of Lime     2.2748     .4396\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCASINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DESCRIPTION OF BEEF CASINGS -- ROUND CASINGS, HOW MADE -- SELECTION\r\n  OF ROUND CASINGS -- EXPORT CASINGS -- DOMESTIC ROUNDS -- BEEF MIDDLES\r\n  -- TURNING AND SLIMING -- INSPECTION AND MEASURING -- BEEF BUNGS --\r\n  BUNG GUT SKINS -- BEEF BLADDERS -- BEEF WEASANDS -- PACKAGES -- SALT\r\n  -- CLEANLINESS -- WATER TEMPERATURE -- MACHINES FOR CASINGS -- HOG\r\n  CASINGS -- SMALL CASINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Description of Beef Casings.=--Casing is a product made from the\r\nintestines of cattle, sheep and hogs. They are saved when animals are\r\nslaughtered in quantities sufficiently large to warrant the care and\r\nattention required. This was one of the products which was wasted where\r\nanimals were slaughtered on a small scale. It is a product worthy of\r\ncareful attention to its production in order that it be in a good,\r\nmarketable condition.\r\n\r\nCasings consist of round or small guts, middle or large intestines,\r\nbungs, weasands and bladders, these being the names of casings obtained\r\nfrom cattle. In the preparation of casings there are five essential\r\npoints to be considered:\r\n\r\n\r\n_First._--Clear water and plenty of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Second._--That they be handled promptly, otherwise they become\r\ndiscolored and color in casings has much to do with their value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third._--That too hot water is not used so as to injure them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fourth._--That the pieces are long and the casings are put up free\r\nfrom tearing or holes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fifth._--Cleanliness and good workmanship.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Round Casings.=--These are the small intestines and are taken from\r\nthe edge of the ruffle by cutting with a knife. The running, as this\r\nwork is termed, is skillful work and care has to be exercised to avoid\r\ncutting. They should if possible be removed in two lengths. They are\r\nthen stripped free from contents, and the clinging fat removed either\r\nby hand scraping or passing through a machine. It is essential that\r\n_all_ the fat from the casing should be removed, as it is detrimental\r\nif left on. After they have been “fatted” they are put into a vat of\r\nwater and “turned,” which process turns them wrong side out, exposing\r\nthe internal part of the intestine. They are then put through a\r\nscraping-machine, which removes all the membrane. This operation is\r\nsometimes done by hand. When this work is completed it is only the\r\nmuscular portion of the intestine that remains. After they are thus\r\nfinished they are inspected either by examination in passing through\r\nthe fingers or by air blowing, preferably the latter. The casings are\r\nmeasured into sets of 108 to 110 feet, green length. A standard set\r\nof rounds is supposed to measure 100 feet, but the larger measure is\r\nallowed as in the salting and curing they shrink so that when measured,\r\ncured, they will not exceed 100 feet. A set of rounds should not have\r\nto exceed five holes, or consist of more than five pieces, the less the\r\nnumber of either holes or pieces the more desirable.\r\n\r\nAfter they are thus measured they are put in a salting box, where they\r\nare shaken up by hand so as to make all the salt possible adhere to\r\nthem. They are then piled on an open truck or rack, so that all the\r\nwater possible will drain off. Remaining in this condition for a day\r\nthey are resalted and packed into tierces. It is necessary, in order to\r\nget the quantity of casings in a tierce to use pressure and press them\r\ntightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Selection of Round Casings.=--Round casings are classified under\r\nseveral headings, namely, export, wide, narrow and domestic.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Export Casings.=--The export rounds are reasonably narrow and\r\nabsolutely free of knots. The knots referred to are those on the\r\nintestines chiefly found in the entrails of native cattle, or cattle\r\nthat have been highly fed, and are objectionable to the foreign trade.\r\nThey are packed 200 sets per tierce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--FATTING MACHINE FOR CASINGS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Domestic Rounds.=--These are for domestic trade. They are wider and\r\nheavier than those exported. They are handled in the same manner,\r\npacked from 150 to 170 sets to the tierce, the difference in the number\r\nof the sets indicating that they are wider casings and not as carefully\r\nselected.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Middles.=--After the ruffle has been pulled off the intestines,\r\nthe middles are pulled apart, leaving all the fat that will adhere\r\nto them. The contents are washed by inserting a hose at the larger\r\nend, partially filling the casing and pouring the contents into a\r\nseparate pipe leading to the catch basin. The workmen press the casing\r\nrather than strip it, as the latter method strips the fat and causes\r\na considerable loss on account of fat carried to catch basin. The\r\ncontents of the intestine washed out, the gut then goes to the fatter,\r\nwho cuts off all the fat with a knife. It is very important to see that\r\nno fat is left on the casing. Any fat which may be left on the casing\r\nwill detract from the appearance. It is usual after fatting, to scrape\r\nthe casing with a wood scraper so as to remove any clinging tissue and\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Turning and Sliming.=--The casing is now turned, fatted side in, and\r\nwhen turned exposes the inner surface. This is hand or machine scraped\r\nand must be perfectly clean, inspection being made to ascertain this\r\ncondition exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Inspecting and Measuring.=--It is best to inspect middle casings by\r\nair, at which time they are selected for wide and narrow standards,\r\nespecially in the larger works. They are measured 62 feet to the set,\r\nallowance being made for shrinkage in salting, so that after they\r\nhave been salted they will measure 57 feet, this being the standard\r\ncommercial length per set. These are handled on the salting benches,\r\netc., the same as rounds. They are selected as follows: They must be\r\nof prime quality, properly cleaned, slimed and salted, closely fatted,\r\nfree from holes, good color and smell, no piece to be less than three\r\nfeet in length, not more than one such piece in a set, and the thin end\r\nof the gut must be cut off. They should be assorted in accordance with\r\nrequirements into--\r\n\r\n  Narrows                            Packed 140 sets to the tierce\r\n  Wides                              Packed  95 sets to the tierce\r\n  Regulars (which means the medium\r\n  casings)                           Packed 110 sets to the tierce\r\n\r\nThe salting and packing process is the same as described for round\r\ncasings.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Bungs.=--These are the larger intestines and have one blind or\r\nclosed end. They have an average length of four feet, but vary with\r\nthe cattle size. The opening, where the small intestine connects with\r\nthe large, should be in the center. The cleaning process is similar to\r\nother casings, except the scraping is done by hand work, or using a\r\nrevolving washing machine.\r\n\r\nBungs, handled practically the same as the previously described\r\ncasings, to be of good quality, full length, properly cleaned, slimed,\r\nsalted and fatted, free from holes, reasonably free from scores and\r\ncuts and of good color. The regular run of these casings should be\r\npacked 400 pieces to the tierce, tied in bundles of five each.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bung Gut Skins.=--From the bung gut is often removed the membrane,\r\nknown as “bung gut skins.” These are used by gold beaters. They are\r\nhandled as follows: The bung gut skins should be started at the cap\r\nend, being careful to remove the skin for about four to six inches from\r\nthe end of the cap, then remove same around the bung end, back of the\r\ncap end first, and next take off toward the open end, after the bung is\r\nskinned back as far as possible beyond the small intestine. The skins\r\nare thin and difficult to remove; there is no difficulty experienced,\r\nhowever, in getting them thirty inches or over in length. After the\r\nskin is removed it is placed in ice water, and, when well chilled, is\r\nsalted thoroughly in the cap and outside. The object of putting the\r\nskin in ice water is to facilitate handling.\r\n\r\nAfter they are thoroughly salted they are hung over a bar covered with\r\na piece of burlap and allowed to hang for one or two days, until they\r\nare thoroughly drained, or dried. When dry each skin is separately\r\nhandled, the loose salt shaken off, and examined for holes and fat and\r\nragged ends. Holes near the edge of the skins can be cut out without\r\nmaterially injuring them. All fat on the edge and ragged ends should\r\nbe cut off. After the skins have passed this inspection they should be\r\nspread full length and width on a table, one over the other, gathered\r\nin bunches of fifty, tied in the center and packed in a tierce. Care\r\nshould be taken in handling the skins not to let them come in contact\r\nwith any iron as that will discolor them. Many casing men object to\r\nremoving the bung gut skins, believing that it injures the casing. If\r\nthey are handled carefully, however, the injury will not be more than\r\nfive per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Bladders.=--Bladders should be cut with a long neck and after\r\nthey have been fatted should be blown up as large as possible and hung\r\nin a dry room to dry. After they are blown and dried, the necks are cut\r\noff and they are flattened out and packed in bundles of twelve each.\r\nThe first grade consists of bladders fourteen inches in length, with\r\nor without necks. The second grade consists of bladders from eleven to\r\nthirteen inches in length with the neck. The third grade consists of\r\nbladders with or without necks, not under nine inches in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Weasands.=--After the meat has been removed from the outside the\r\nweasand is turned wrong side out, washed, both ends tied, and blown\r\nfull of air. After they are blown with compressed air they are hung\r\nin a dry room, which should have a temperature of 110° to 120° F.,\r\nand left there until thoroughly dried. They are then taken out, the\r\nends cut off, the weasands put in bundles of twenty-five each, twenty\r\nbundles tied together into a large bundle, five or ten of these large\r\nbundles constituting a case. Regular weasands must be of prime quality,\r\nproperly dried, entirely free from worms, and at least twenty-four\r\ninches long, allowing not over four pieces of shorter (same to be at\r\nleast eighteen inches long) to the bundle of twenty-five. Two of such\r\nshort ones will be counted as one full weasand.\r\n\r\nNarrow weasands are those which, while being dried, have a weight\r\nof about three pounds hung on the end, drawing them out as long as\r\npossible, which has the tendency to make them narrow. These should\r\nnot be blown as full of air as those not drawn. After they are dried\r\nthey must be at least twenty-six inches long and from two to two and\r\none-half inches in width when flattened out. Other conditions same as\r\nthe regular weasands, except that they must be entirely free from skin\r\nworms and skin-worm marks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Packages.=--The packages used for beef casings are usually soft\r\nwood tierces, free from any stain such as occurs in an oak stave.\r\nA second-hand glucose tierce is preferable. They should be cleaned\r\nthoroughly before filling, by scraping free from any char, and then\r\nwell washed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Salt.=--The salt usually used is the “No. 1 Fine” grade of evaporated\r\nsalt. In first and second saltings the casings must be carefully\r\ncovered, particularly at the points where the bunch is tied.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cleanliness.=--It is difficult to properly describe the care necessary\r\nin every stage to insure clean casings. Water from inland or murky\r\nrivers should be settled of filtered to make clean, bright casings.\r\nEvery particle of fat or fibre to which any sediment or stain can\r\nadhere makes a black spot upon the finished salted casings. There is\r\nperhaps no department where such scrupulous care is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water Temperature.=--Water used in cleaning casings should be about\r\n90° F., in temperature, and kept uniformly so, until the casing has\r\nbeen turned and slimed, when it should be submerged and kept in cool\r\nwater at a temperature of about 40° F., until passed to the salting\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Machines for Casings.=--Beef casing machines equipped with rice-root\r\nbrushes are termed “fatting machines,” while those fitted with bristle\r\nbrushes are termed “sliming machines.”\r\n\r\nTo process middle guts by machine, they are passed twice through a\r\nfatting machine, turned and passed three times through the sliming\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nTo process round guts they are passed through the fatting and sliming\r\nmachines twice. To obtain the best results the brushes should run 1550\r\nr. p. m. About three horse-power is required to operate a machine. Salt\r\nin the sliming water is an advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hog Casings.=--It is more difficult to describe the saving of hog\r\ncasings. The first item is the removing of the bung which should be\r\npulled carefully, and be as long as possible. The removal of the bung\r\nwithout scoring, breaking or cutting is a part of the slaughtering work\r\nand requires skillful knife work to accomplish it properly. As soon\r\nas the bung gut is pulled it is stripped and trimmed carefully so as\r\nto not destroy the crown. The clinging fat is removed and the bung is\r\nthen turned, after which they are classified and salted over night in\r\na pickle for the purpose of curing. The following day they are bundled\r\nand packed in second-hand hardwood tierces. The grading is difficult to\r\ndescribe since the standards vary slightly. They are usually classified\r\nas No. 1, medium primes, and No. 2 quality.\r\n\r\nThe grading of hog bungs for export and medium primes require that they\r\nshall be full crown, free from cuts and scores, pulled full length, and\r\nwhen wind tested and blown to about the distention when stuffed, are\r\nmeasured eighteen inches from the crown:\r\n\r\n  Exports       1¹⁵⁄₁₆ inches diameter and over\r\n  Medium Prime  1³⁄₄ inches diameter and over\r\n  No. 2         Less than 1³⁄₄ inches diameter\r\n\r\n\r\n=Small Casings.=--The small casings are pulled from the set stripped\r\nand soaked over night to allow a fermentation or decay of the slime\r\nand muscle on the tissue. The length of time for the soaking and the\r\nfermentation are controlled by the workman. Soaking too long or too\r\nmuch heat rots the casing. Too little makes it difficult to properly\r\nclean. Water test each gut. This is an advantage since it washes each\r\npiece and locates all holes. At the same time the casings are selected\r\nfor width. After selecting and cleaning in this manner the casings are\r\nput in bundles of equal size measured as to quantity. They are then\r\nwell salted and placed upon draining benches to cure. After a period of\r\nfrom three to five days they are shaken free from salt, rubbed with new\r\nfinely ground salt and packed in hardwood barrels. These barrels should\r\nbe cloth lined after soaking several days, the water being changed\r\nevery forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nThe salting process is the trick in the casing business. Casings are\r\nusually sold on a free of salt basis, and are supposed to contain forty\r\nper cent salt, this quantity being allowed. On shaking, at times, they\r\nwill show sixty per cent, therefore it behooves the buyer or seller to\r\nbe on guard.\r\n\r\nMachines are used for passing the casing through for removal of muscle\r\nand slime. In these, rapidly revolving knives or scrapers fitting\r\nclosely to a roller, perform the process. The casings after passing\r\nthrough the machines are handled by hand, each piece being scraped\r\nwhile on a board and any holes that may appear being cut out, as well\r\nas ragged ends cut square.\r\n\r\nThe average yield in hog casings is usually one-quarter pound per hog.\r\nIt takes close attention to develop this quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nBEEF MISCELLANY\r\n\r\n\r\n  BEEF MISCELLANEOUS -- LIVERS -- SWEETBREADS -- BEEF HEARTS -- TAILS\r\n  -- WEASAND MEAT -- BEEF TONGUES -- WASHING -- HANGING -- TRIMMING\r\n  -- CURING -- FREEZING -- SURPLUS ROUNDS -- STRIPPING BEEF HAMS --\r\n  FORMULAS FOR CURING -- SMOKING -- TESTS -- GLASS JAR BEEF -- BEEF\r\n  TRIMMINGS -- BARREL BEEF -- TRIPE -- CLEANING TRIPE -- PICKLING --\r\n  COST OF PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Miscellaneous.=--The rising value of all flesh foods makes it\r\nimperative to carefully conserve all kinds of products and this chapter\r\nis devoted to a description of the care and handling of these products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Livers.=--There is no edible part of the animal which becomes stale\r\nas quickly as the liver. The large proportion of water in its makeup\r\ntogether with the presence of blood and the residual matter from its\r\nfunction in the body all contribute to this rapid decay, and only by\r\nthe most careful attention will they keep a very great length of time\r\nunless they are frozen. The vital point in handling livers successfully\r\nis to promptly send them to a proper cooler.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they are taken from the animal they should be trimmed, care\r\nbeing taken that in cutting the gall bag from the liver they are not\r\ncontaminated with gall, the trimming consisting of cutting around the\r\nlower lobe so as to permit the blood contained therein to drip out.\r\n\r\nThe cooler in which they are stored should be of the same character\r\nas a beef cooler with an overhead loft and a positive and good\r\ncirculation. The livers should be separated so that warm ones will not\r\ncome in contact with cold ones. The temperature of the cooler should\r\nbe about 32° F. In hanging, the cooling racks are preferably metal,\r\nfrequently cleansed by scalding and should be arranged so that livers\r\ndo not drip on those below.\r\n\r\nAt certain times of the year it is profitable to freeze them for the\r\nwinter trade. Where this is done it will be found that if they are\r\nfirst properly dried and chilled, they freeze in much better condition\r\nthan if put into the freezer when they are full of moisture. They\r\nshould be frozen at a temperature as near zero Fahr. as possible, for\r\nif frozen quickly they retain their natural color, whereas, if they are\r\nput into a higher temperature and the freezing is delayed, they will\r\nhave a dark appearance when thawed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sweetbreads.=--This is a delicate piece of meat and practically the\r\nonly one in the packing house that improves by being kept in water.\r\nThe sweetbread should be cut out before the animal is stuck, thereby\r\navoiding their becoming bloody and discolored. After washing and fat is\r\ntrimmed off, they should be put in ice water in the coolers and held\r\nover night; the next day they are ready for shipment and should be\r\npacked in cracked ice.\r\n\r\nIf they are to be frozen they should be allowed to drain properly\r\nbefore placing them in the freezers. A low temperature is very\r\nessential for the preservation of sweetbreads, in order to obtain the\r\nbest possible appearance. When frozen quickly they retain a bright\r\nappearance when thawed. If they are frozen slowly they turn slate\r\ncolor when thawed and have an undesirable and unwholesome look, which\r\noperates against their being disposed of to advantage.\r\n\r\nWestern or range cattle, yield a very small proportion of sweetbreads,\r\nthey being undeveloped by the animal when living in their natural\r\nstate. Cattle which have been fattened in feed lots, however, yield\r\nmuch larger sweetbreads.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Hearts.=--This piece of meat is generally used in sausage and\r\ncanning, largely in the former. The hearts after being taken from the\r\nanimals are trimmed and washed and should be hung in a cooler where\r\nthere is a temperature of from 33° to 36° F. After they are thoroughly\r\nchilled they are used for sausage purposes, either fresh or cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tails.=--There is little to be said on the handling of tails, except\r\nthat they should be kept clean, for if handled carelessly and allowed\r\nto become stained it is impossible ever to get them clean afterward,\r\nand it is always preferable not to wash them, as this has a tendency to\r\ndiscolor them when chilled. If they are to be frozen they should be put\r\ninto the freezer under a low temperature in order to have them come out\r\nin desirable condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--MECHANICAL WASHER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Weasand Meat.=--This is a meat taken off the weasands. It is a low\r\ngrade of meat and is at times “tanked” rather than saved. When cured\r\nit should be packed in tierces, and to a tierce of 400 pounds sprinkle\r\nthrough thoroughly a mixture of twenty pounds of salt and one pound of\r\nsaltpetre. The goods should be held in storage at from 36° to 38° F.\r\nduring the process of curing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Tongues.=--The tongue should receive careful attention from the\r\ntime it is taken out of the head, until it is cured. In taking the\r\ntongue out of the head it should be left smooth on the bottom, leaving\r\non all fat. It should be cut close to the jaws, taking off with it all\r\nfat possible, as it is worth much more on the tongue than if left on\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Washing._--The tongue should be thoroughly washed in warm water, say\r\nat 80° F., as soon as taken from the head. Mechanical washers like that\r\nshown in the accompanying illustration, Fig. 78, are frequently used\r\nto good advantage. Immediately upon washing they should be chilled in\r\nclean, cold water, when they are hung to drip and then sent to the\r\ncooler.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hanging._--In hanging, the tongue should be suspended from a hook\r\nat the point where the tongue was attached to the jaw bone and the\r\ntip also fastened upon the same hook. This gives the tongue a compact\r\nappearance, but if it is hung up by the point alone when warm, its own\r\nweight stretches it out of shape, and it never looks as well as when\r\nhung as described. Tongues should be hung in a temperature of from 32°\r\nto 34° F. for forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trimming._--Tongues are selected for trimming into short and long\r\ncuts. In trimming, the side bones should be cut equally and the side\r\nmeats cut with a long knife and a draw movement so as to make a smooth\r\nappearing tongue. “Long cut tongue” means that the gullet and about two\r\njoints of the windpipe are left on. In “short cut tongue” the gullet is\r\nentirely cut away. Long cut tongue should average not less than five\r\npounds in weight. The trimmings are retrimmed, the lean parts being\r\nsuitable for sausage and the fat for tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Curing._--They should first be put into a plain pickle, eighty degrees\r\nstrong, at a temperature of 38° to 40° F. for twenty-four hours. This\r\nis done to remove all the saliva from the tongue, which has the effect\r\nof making the pickle “strong,” if the tongues are put direct into the\r\ncuring pickle.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment with plain pickle they are put into a sweet pickle to\r\nbe cured, the sweet pickle consisting of 280 pounds of salt, English\r\nsalt being preferable, to which is added ten pounds of saltpetre and\r\ntwenty-four pounds of sugar to each 160 gallons of water. This should\r\nbe stirred well to insure thorough dissolving of the ingredients. The\r\ntongues are then put into barrels, hogsheads or vats, as the case may\r\nbe, and sufficient pickle put on to submerge them. At the end of five\r\ndays they should be shifted from one package to another, and at the end\r\nof fifteen days they should be rehandled, this being done to bring\r\nthe pickle into thorough contact with the different pieces. Tongues\r\nshould be fully cured at the end of thirty days, ready to smoke, or for\r\nshipment. When tongues are packed in barrels, after being fully cured,\r\nthey should be packed, 202 pounds to the barrel, filling the package up\r\nwith the same pickle in which they were cured. They are then ready for\r\nshipment. Tongues readily become excessively salty if allowed to remain\r\nin cure too long. It is desirable to have them “off cure” about as\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Freezing._--As there is an increased demand for tongues in the warm\r\nmonths over any other part of the year, it is advantageous to hold them\r\nfrozen until the demand develops. In freezing it is necessary that\r\nthey should be put in a very low temperature and frozen quickly, as if\r\nhandled otherwise it has a tendency to give them an undesirable color\r\nwhen cured. They can be thawed, cured, and smoked as required.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Test on Freezing Beef Tongues._--The following is a test on tongues\r\nthus handled, showing the percentage of shrinkage, freezing, curing and\r\nsmoking:\r\n\r\nTEST ON FREEZING BEEF TONGUES.\r\n\r\n                                                                    Per\r\n                                                            Lbs.   cent.\r\n  Weight of twenty-five 5¹⁄₂-lb. beef tongues to freezer     140\r\n  In freezer one week--weight                                138\r\n                                                             ---\r\n    Freezing shrinkage                                         2 =  1.43\r\n\r\n  Taken from freezer to leacher--weight                      138\r\n  Leached twenty hours in city water--weight                 144\r\n  After leaching, drained twelve hours--weight               142\r\n                                                             ---\r\n    Gain leaching from frozen to drained weight                4 =  2.90\r\n    Gain leaching from green to drained weight                 2 =  1.43\r\n\r\n  After leaching--pickled--weight to pickle                  142\r\n  Rubbed in salt and packed in bbls. with seventy-deg.\r\n  pickle to remain for forty-five days; overhauled in forty\r\n  days, and five days later dumped at forty-five days\r\n  weight                                                     141\r\n  Drained eight hours--weight                                139\r\n                                                             ---\r\n    Shrinkage from green to cured--drained weight              1 =  0.71\r\n    Shrinkage from leached to cured--drained weight            3 =  2.11\r\n\r\n  Weight from cellar to smoke house                          139\r\n  Smoked fifteen hours--average temperature, 116°\r\n  F.--smoked weight                                          117\r\n                                                             ---\r\n    Shrinkage to smoked from green weight                     23 = 16.43\r\n    Shrinkage to smoked from leached weight                   25 = 17.60\r\n    Shrinkage to smoked from cured weight                     22 = 15.82\r\n\r\n\r\n=Surplus Beef Rounds.=--Where cattle are cut in large quantities it is\r\nalmost impossible to sell the rounds fresh, there being comparatively\r\nsmall demand for round steak. It is necessary to use this particular\r\npart of the meat in some other product, which is done by making what is\r\nknown as “beef hams.” The very light rounds, or rounds out of canning\r\ncattle, are generally used for canning purposes, they being too light\r\nto suit the trade for “beef hams.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stripping Beef Hams.=--In preparing “beef hams” the rounds are cut by\r\nwhat is known as the “packing house cut,” which leaves a piece of meat\r\nfrom the rump on the round, as compared to the ordinary cut. This piece\r\nis what is known as the “knuckle” piece of the set. Rounds cut this\r\nway are considered regular. When rounds, cut for market purposes, are\r\nstripped, they are known as short knuckled rounds and are not accepted\r\nas regular.\r\n\r\nBefore the round is stripped, the fell, or covering, is skinned off,\r\nand the seam of the knuckle followed around by the knife, cutting clear\r\nto the bone. The round is hung on a hook and an incision made just\r\nabove the stifle joint and the knuckle piece peeled from the bone. The\r\nround is then turned on the hook and opened to the bone, making what is\r\nknown as the “inside-and-outside piece” of the round.\r\n\r\nIn opening the round, what is known as the “kernel fat” should be\r\nequally divided. These three pieces are what is known as regular beef\r\nhams when packed in sets. When separated they are known as “insides,”\r\n“outsides” and “knuckles.” These hams are cured and smoked and are sold\r\nat retail as dried beef, the largest sale for this kind of meat being\r\nin warm weather. The piece that is left is the shank.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Curing.=--On the manner in which beef hams are cured depends, to a\r\ngreat extent, their sale. The object in curing is to have them not too\r\nsalty, thoroughly cured through, and of a bright and attractive color\r\nwhen smoked.\r\n\r\nThe hams when cut from the cattle should be either spread out or\r\nhung up in a room held at a temperature of from 33° to 35° F., for\r\ntwenty-four hours, thereby insuring proper chilling. They are then best\r\ncured in vats holding 1,000 pounds each; many, however, cure them in\r\ntierces or barrels.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Formulas for Curing Beef Hams.=--Two formulas for the pickle follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Formula._--To 1,500 gallons of 80-degree strength pickle, add\r\n300 pounds granulated sugar, 105 pounds saltpetre. Where a smaller\r\namount of pickle is wanted make it proportionately. As the meat is\r\npacked in vats, sprinkle in a little fine salt. The vat should then\r\nbe filled with above pickle, and a rack and weight put on to keep the\r\nmeat submerged. The hams should be overhauled three times, first in\r\nten days, again twenty-five days later and again forty days after the\r\nsecond overhauling. Beef hams should be considered fully cured in from\r\nseventy-five to eighty-five days. If cured in tierces or barrels, they\r\nshould be rolled at the same periods as in the case of overhauling in\r\nthe vats, giving the pickle a chance to thoroughly reach all parts of\r\nthe meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Second Formula._--Another formula used extensively, where beef hams\r\nare packed and cured exclusively in barrels, is as follows: Dissolve\r\n150 pounds of saltpetre in hot, 88-degree pickle, made from Ashton or\r\ndairy salt, a sufficient amount of pickle being used to make fifty-two\r\ngallons when dissolved. It is necessary to heat the pickle in order to\r\ndissolve this amount of salt. Add 450 pounds of granulated sugar and\r\nsufficient cold 88-degree pickle to make 200 gallons of the finished\r\nsolution. This is then chilled to a temperature of 40° to 45° F. One\r\ngallon of this solution is put into each barrel before commencing to\r\npack the meats.\r\n\r\nWhen packing the meat in barrels, use twenty-three pounds of Ashton, or\r\ndairy salt, sprinkling between the layers as they are put in. When the\r\nbarrel is needed, water at a temperature of 40° to 45° F., barrels to\r\nbe rolled in ten, thirty and fifty days after being packed. They should\r\nbe stored in a temperature of from 38° to 40° F. if they are to be used\r\nin ninety days. If they are to be held for five or six months they\r\nshould be kept at a temperature of 35° to 39° F. for the first thirty\r\ndays and thereafter at a temperature of from 28° to 29° F. until used.\r\nMeats cured with this formula will be found to have a very good color\r\nand flavor and at the same time will not be too salty. In putting the\r\nmeat in packages, pack 215 pounds green weight per barrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Smoking.=--The smoking of beef hams is treated in the chapter on the\r\nSmoke House.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tests.=--The following are three smoking tests on regular beef hams,\r\ngiven to illustrate yields in the finished product from a sample lot of\r\neach cut:\r\n\r\nREGULAR OUTSIDES FOR SHIPMENT.\r\n\r\n                                                             Wt.

Beef handled in this manner\r\nis cured by formulas given, but in smoking it is handled somewhat\r\ndifferently, being smoked less and dried more, it being necessary to\r\nhave all the pickle and moisture evaporated from the meats to insure\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\nAfter the meat has been handled as described it is generally put in\r\nsmoke houses equipped with steam coils, the heat brought up to 110°\r\nto 120° F., and left to dry from three to four days. It then shows a\r\nshrinkage anywhere from 35 to 42 per cent. It is necessary to dry beef\r\nin this manner in order to make it keep satisfactorily when put in cans.\r\n\r\nThe following test will show the shrinkage of this product when smoked\r\nin the manner described above for canning purposes:\r\n\r\nSHRINKAGE OF SMOKED DRIED BEEF HAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                            Wt.\r\n                                               Packed      lbs.

The following\r\nformula will serve for the curing of beef, pork and sheep cheek meat\r\nand hearts, hanging tenderloins and other meats for sausage and canning\r\npurposes:\r\n\r\nTo 1,100 gallons of seventy-degree pickle dissolve seventy-nine pounds\r\nsaltpetre. Use this pickle for the curing of beef cheek meat, pig\r\nsnouts, pork cheek meat, sheep cheek meat, ox-lips, beef hearts, etc.\r\nThis material is usually cured in vats and should be overhauled in\r\nfive, fifteen and thirty days after being packed. If freezer space is\r\navailable it is preferable to box it in convenient sizes and to freeze\r\nit, using it as a fresh product, when thawed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Barreled Beef.=--Barreled beef, graded as described, in a previous\r\nchapter, is usually packed in barrels, using a plain pickle fully\r\nsaturated. It is cured in the packages with a pickle of the following\r\nformula, for plate beef, rump butts, briskets, clods, and all trimmings\r\nof a similar character:\r\n\r\nTo 1,500 gallons of 100-degree strength pickle add ninety-eight pounds\r\nof saltpetre. It will be found necessary to dissolve the saltpetre\r\nbefore putting it into the pickle. Store in a cellar at 38° F.\r\ntemperature. Repack with capping salt at time of shipment if for long\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tripe.=--Tripe is an article for which there is a large demand in the\r\neastern states, comparatively little of it being consumed in other\r\nstates, while there is not a very great foreign demand. It is made from\r\nthe stomachs of cattle and is a very wholesome and nutritious dish. It\r\nis also being used extensively in sausage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cleaning Tripe._--The stomach after being made empty is thoroughly\r\nwashed in such a manner or with such devices as to permit of removing\r\nall manure from the inside surface. After it is thoroughly washed, put\r\ninto a kettle, or vat, scalded, the temperature of the water being\r\nfrom 140° to 160° F. After a few minutes immersion the inside lining\r\nof the stomach may be easily removed. When sufficiently scalded it is\r\nscraped, leaving a clean, white surface. After scraping it is put into\r\na vat and boiled for about three hours, or until it is tender. It is\r\nthen put into cold water and chilled, the fat from the seams is removed\r\nand the “finishing process” begins, first scraping off all the loose\r\nfat with a sharp scraper and then removing a membrane on the outside\r\nof the stomach, which, when worked carefully, comes off, leaving the\r\n“tripe” perfectly clean and free of any fat, etc.,--the tripe being the\r\nmuscular part of the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pickling._--It should first be put into a 45-grain vinegar pickle for\r\nten to fifteen hours. After it has been submitted to the first pickling\r\nit is ready to be put into barrels and the vinegar in which it was\r\nfirst pickled should be strengthened with full-strength vinegar, making\r\nit again 45-grain, when it is packed in barrels and should be held in a\r\ntemperature of from 45° to 50° F.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable gain in tripe if properly handled. A barrel of\r\ntripe packed at 135 pounds, at the end of three weeks, will weigh out\r\n200 pounds and sometimes as high as 215 pounds. The tripe absorbs\r\nthe vinegar, and it is essential in storing tripe that it be kept at\r\na temperature so this absorption can take place, if it is kept in\r\ntoo cool a temperature it will not take up the vinegar as it should,\r\nconsequently the gain will not be found when the package is opened.\r\n\r\nThe following test will show the gain in a barrel of honey-comb and a\r\nbarrel of plain tripe, one barrel of each being packed in 45-degree\r\nvinegar and one barrel of each in 60-degree vinegar.\r\n\r\nTEST PACKING TRIPE HOT DIRECT FROM FINISHING TABLE.\r\n\r\n                                                                    Per\r\n                                                             Lbs.  cent.\r\n  One barrel honey-comb, 45-degree vinegar, 95 pcs. packed\r\n  weight                                                     125\r\n  Held in cellar for two weeks and unpacked, weight          227\r\n                                                             ---\r\n    Gain                                                     102 = 81.60\r\n\r\n  Drained over night on racks, weight                        183\r\n    Loss draining from pickled weight                         44 = 19.38\r\n    Gain to drained weight from packed weight                 58 = 46.40\r\n  One barrel honey-comb, 60-degree pickle, ninety-three\r\n  pcs. packed, weight                                        125\r\n  Held in cellar for two weeks and unpacked, weight          227\r\n                                                             ---\r\n    Gain                                                     102 = 81.60\r\n\r\n  Drained over night on racks, weight                        194\r\n    Loss draining from pickled weight                         33 = 14.53\r\n    Gain to drained weight from packed weight                 69 = 55.20\r\n  One barrel plain, 45-degree pickle, thirty-nine pcs.\r\n  packed weight                                              125\r\n  Held in cellar for two weeks and unpacked, weight          193\r\n                                                             ---\r\n   Gain                                                       68 = 54.50\r\n\r\n  Drained over night on racks, weight                        182\r\n    Loss draining from pickled weight                         11 =  5.70\r\n    Gain to drained weight from packed weight                 57 = 45.60\r\n  One barrel plain, 60-degree pickle, thirty-eight pcs.\r\n  packed weight                                              125\r\n  Held in cellar two weeks and unpacked, weight              201\r\n                                                             ---\r\n    Gain                                                      76 = 60.80\r\n\r\n  Drained on racks over night, weight                        184\r\n    Loss draining, from pickled weight                        17 =  8.45\r\n    Gain to drained weight from packed weight                 59 = 47.20\r\n\r\n  Temperature all pickle when put on tripe 65° F.

Prior\r\nto that time, while there were many sheep raised, mutton, except in\r\nthe large centers, was comparatively little used. The packers being\r\nable to obtain sheep in large quantities at live stock centers, and\r\nwith their superior distributing facilities, soon created a demand for\r\nmutton at points where previously there had been little demand. As a\r\nconsequence there has been a large increase in the production of sheep\r\nand consumption in this country.\r\n\r\nIt is a meat for which many must acquire a taste, but it is very\r\nhealthful and nutritious. At the central abattoirs, where government\r\ninspection is in force, comparatively few diseases, or few diseased\r\nsheep, are found, this particular kind of live stock proving to be much\r\nhealthier than either cattle or hogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Penning.=--Sheep should always be kept in dry pens before killing,\r\nfor if their fleece is allowed to become dirty, it is practically\r\nimpossible to prevent the meat from becoming stained. Where the sheep\r\nget wet and muddy it is found of great advantage to hold them for a\r\ntime in pens with two to four inches of dry sawdust on the floor, this\r\nsawdust having the effect of cleaning and drying the legs and under\r\npart of the body so that after slaughtering, when the pelt is removed,\r\nthe meat may be kept much cleaner than otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dressing by Piece Methods.=--The dressing of an individual sheep,\r\n“round dress,” as commonly performed is such a simple process that one\r\nwould naturally ask why change.\r\n\r\nIn the economic use of labor about the modern packing house, probably\r\nno other department can show the benefit of modern methods to greater\r\nadvantage than in sheep slaughtering. The effects of this division are\r\nfirst, economy, and second, better workmanship. It is natural that a\r\nman performing one particular operation day after day becomes more\r\nexpert than if he were doing various kinds of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=String Gang.=--Formerly sheep were slaughtered largely on a piece-work\r\nbasis, one man dressing the sheep throughout. With the modern method\r\neach man does one particular part of the work, becoming very quick and\r\nexpert in his line.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 79 a string gang at work killing and dressing sheep is shown.\r\nA gang sufficient to handle 300 sheep an hour should have at least\r\nthirty-six to forty sets of hooks, or, in other words, facilities for\r\nworking on thirty-six to forty sheep at one time on the dressing rails.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sheep Ring.=--An early type of “sheep rings” is shown in the\r\naccompanying drawing, Fig. 80. The principles formerly in use are\r\nnow modified to the extent that an endless conveyor is substituted\r\nfor the stationary dressing beams, the output being increased. Some\r\nadditional beneficial features are added, namely the use of a wheel\r\nhoist which is substituted for the friction hoist. In a space 80 × 32\r\nfeet in size, 2,000 sheep per day can be handled readily by means of\r\nthe complete ring method. The sheep are hoisted with a double shackle,\r\ntwo at a time, and the work is continuous from there on until they are\r\ndressed, the sheep never touching the floor again, which means a great\r\nsaving of labor over the old way of handling sheep by hand entirely.\r\nThis diagram illustrates the different processes in the arrangement,\r\nit also gives height of rails, trucks, spreaders and hooks used on the\r\ndifferent rails. Wherever a volume of thirty sheep per hour or over are\r\nbeing slaughtered a saving can be effected by adopting this method of\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--VIEW OF A “STRING GANG” AT WORK KILLING AND\r\nDRESSING SHEEP.--CONVEYORS ARE NOW SUBSTITUTED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--DIAGRAM SHOWING ARRANGEMENT FOR SHEEP KILLING\r\nAND DRESSING WITH “STRING GANG.”]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 101 is shown how the hogs are handled by means of a wheel\r\nhoist, two at a time, and hung on the sticking rail. Likewise where\r\nsheep are killed in large numbers, it is advantageous to hoist two at a\r\ntime, the shackle being modified. The men shackling become very expert\r\nand can shackle two in practically the same time that they can one, and\r\nif a gang are running on a capacity of five hundred per hour, it will\r\nbe seen that considerable time is gained by doing it in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Choice.\r\n  Good.\r\n  Medium.\r\n  Common.\r\n\r\nFIG. 81.--WETHERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sheep Dressing.=--In the dressing of sheep the following suggestions\r\nwill prove advantageous in turning out work with the best results,\r\nwhether the sheep are dressed by day work, one man dressing them\r\nthroughout, or whether they are handled by a string gang.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Legging._--This consists in opening up the skin around the legs and\r\ncenter of the body. In doing this work care should be taken that the\r\nskin be opened up as little around the necks and butts as possible, for\r\nwherever the skin is removed in the legging there is more or less stain\r\non the meat, which it is impossible to wash off.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pelting._--In removing the pelt from the carcass care should be taken\r\nthat the “fell” is not broken in any part, for wherever this is broken,\r\nthe meat will show the effect of age, and will present a very unsightly\r\nappearance. The removal of the skin over the brisket is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Methods of Finishing._--This is a part of the work which is very hard\r\nto describe, as the dressing at different points varies to such an\r\nextent that there are hardly two large cities where the methods are\r\nalike, especially in the case of lambs. Generally speaking mutton is\r\n“round dressed,” using no back sets and not using the caul. Lambs are\r\ndressed according to localities, some round dressed, same as mutton,\r\nothers with double back sets and the caul on, others with single back\r\nsets and the ribs broken and still others with inside sets, in every\r\ninstance the caul being left on. The photograph illustrates dressings\r\nfor various American markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Washing and its Effect.=--When the mutton is run immediately into a\r\nwell-built refrigerator where the proper circulation and temperatures\r\ncan be maintained, there is no danger in using an excess amount of\r\nwater in the washing. A wash cloth made of ten to fifteen thicknesses\r\nof very loosely woven cheese cloth quilted together, makes an excellent\r\ncloth with which to wash sheep. This, in connection with plenty of hot\r\nwater, will give a bright and attractive appearance to the meat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Good.\r\n  Medium.\r\n\r\nFIG. 82.--BUCKS.--ROUND DRESSED SHEEP.--INDICATING QUALITY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A, choice yearlings.\r\n  B, medium yearlings.\r\n  C, choppers.\r\n\r\nFIG. 83.--SHOWING ROUND DRESS AND LAMB DRESS.--CAUL ON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Choice.\r\n  Good.\r\n\r\nFIG. 84.--SPRING LAMBS SHOWING QUALITY.--NOTE “BOOTS.”]\r\n\r\nWhere the dressed mutton is not run into a cooler, and outside air is\r\ndepended upon for chilling, very little water should be used, the meat\r\nsimply being wiped with a rag, made as heretofore described, dipping in\r\nhot water and wringing dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--“GENUINE” SPRING LAMB.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Medium.\r\n  Common.\r\n  Canner.\r\n\r\nFIG. 86.--EWES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Boston style sheep.\r\n  Boston style lambs.\r\n  Philadelphia style lambs.\r\n\r\nFIG. 87.--SHIPPING MUTTON AND LAMBS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--=~A~=, PROVIDENCE STYLE LAMBS; =~B~=,\r\nCONNECTICUT STYLE LAMBS; =~C~=, GOATS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--MUTTON AND LAMB CHOPS.\r\n\r\n  1, 2.

If left out, and partially\r\nair-chilled it has the effect of discoloring them about the legs\r\nand thin parts of the carcasses, causing these to look dark and\r\nless attractive than when placed in the cooler immediately after\r\nslaughtering. There is little or no danger of chilling sheep too fast,\r\nas long as the temperature is above 32° F., and the colder the room\r\ninto which they are put, as long as it is above freezing point, the\r\nbetter will be the appearance of the mutton when it comes out of the\r\ncooler. Sheep chilled for twenty-four hours in proper coolers, and\r\nthoroughly dried and hardened, are ready for shipment or the cutting\r\nblock. In many places, especially in Australia and South America, they\r\nare frozen. They should be thoroughly chilled in a dry cooler where\r\nthere is a good circulation of air, for twenty-four hours, after which\r\nthey may be put into the freezers at a temperature as near zero as\r\npossible, so that the freezing will not be delayed. If they are frozen\r\nquickly they retain a clear, bright appearance when thawed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Choice.\r\n  Good.\r\n\r\nFIG. 94.--VEAL SADDLES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lamb Tongues.=--All tongues from sheep come under this head. After\r\nthey have been taken out of the heads they should be thrown into ice\r\nwater, washed and spread on a table, or in pans, in the cooler at a\r\ntemperature of from 34° to 38° F. for twenty-four hours. Following that\r\nthey should be trimmed, cutting off the extra pieces of fat and the\r\ngullet. They are then ready for curing. They should be cured in a plain\r\n75-degree strength pickle with six ounces of saltpetre to 1,000 pounds\r\nof meat, holding them in this pickle for a week or ten days. They are\r\nthen ready for use, either in sausage or for cooking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Medium.\r\n  Common.\r\n\r\nFIG. 95.--VEAL SADDLES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pickled Lamb Tongues.=--When tongues are pickled they are put up\r\nwith a white wine vinegar and are handled as follows: After they are\r\nthoroughly chilled they are scalded sufficiently to take off the\r\noutside film or skin on the tongue. This is then scraped off with\r\na hand scraper, or knife, and the tongue trimmed, cutting off any\r\nparts that are discolored, or any loose pieces of fat. The tongues are\r\nafterwards cooked until they are soft enough for the bone to pull out\r\nreadily. No special time can be fixed upon for this work as the cooking\r\nvaries greatly, according to the condition of the animals from which\r\nthe tongues were taken, and it is well in cooking them to keep the\r\nsheep and lamb tongues separate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Choice.\r\n  Good.\r\n\r\nFIG. 96.--VEAL RACKS.]\r\n\r\nAfter they are cooked and the bones are pulled out at the root of the\r\ntongue, they are ready for pickling. They should first be pickled in\r\n45-degree vinegar for at least twenty-four hours, when they are ready\r\nto be packed in packages for shipment using 40-degree vinegar by adding\r\nfull strength fresh vinegar to the pickle they were first put in. In\r\npacking them in small packages especially, they are generally seasoned\r\nwith coriander seed, bay leaves and sliced lemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lamb Tongue Tests.=--The following tests show yields of pickled lamb\r\ntongues at values prevailing at the time they were made:\r\n\r\nTEST ON 1,000 PIECES OF 320 POUNDS LAMB TONGUES.\r\n\r\n  Cost of 1,000 pieces lamb tongues at ³⁄₄c each         $ 7.50\r\n  Scraping, 10c per 100 pieces                             1.00\r\n  Snouting, cooking, etc., one and a half hours, at 18c     .27\r\n  Trimming at 5c per 100 pieces                             .50\r\n  Pickling, 10c per 100 pieces                             1.00\r\n  Miscellaneous labor                                       .17\r\n  General expense, 42c per cwt. on 143 lbs. produced        .60\r\n                                                          -----   $11.04\r\n    _Produced:_\r\n  Green weight                                320 lbs.\r\n  Cooked weight                               143 lbs.\r\n                                              ---\r\n    Shrinkage                                 177 lbs. or 55%\r\n  Credit 23 lbs. trimmings at 1¹⁄₂c per lb.                        $ .35\r\n                                                                  -----\r\n    Cost of 143 lbs. of lamb tongues                             $10.69\r\n  Cost per pound, $0.0747.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Slaughtering Calves.=--This item is so simple that it scarcely needs\r\nmentioning. The chief thing is cleanliness of the hide. Where the work\r\nis performed in quantity the calves are knocked, hoisted to a rail;\r\nstuck, bled and passed through a washing tub; soaked and curried so the\r\nhides are made entirely free from manure, and then scraped reasonably\r\ndry. The calf is then gutted and placed in a cooler, if it is to be\r\nsold skinned and it is preferable that it be cold skinned. The color\r\njustifies the labor expense. Some fancy dressed calves with caul spread\r\nare hot skinned but this is a local matter common to but few markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heads and Feet.=--Heads and feet are scalded in sets, and sold fresh\r\nor frozen. Eastern markets consume these in quite large quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nHOG SLAUGHTERING\r\n\r\n\r\n  HISTORICAL -- INVESTMENT -- HOG YARDING -- HOG DRESSING -- HOISTING\r\n  -- STICKING -- NECK WASHING -- SCALDING -- SCRAPING MACHINES -- HAND\r\n  SCRAPING -- CLEANING BODIES -- HAM FACING AND CUTTING -- LEAF LARD\r\n  -- SPLITTING -- WASHING -- DRYING -- CARE IN CHILL ROOMS -- OPEN AIR\r\n  HANGING -- CHILLING NECESSITIES -- SHRINKAGE IN CHILL ROOMS -- HOG\r\n  BY-PRODUCTS -- HEADS -- PLUCKS -- PAUNCHES -- ENTRAIL FAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Historical.=--In no department of the industry has the progress been\r\nso extensive as in pork packing. Only a few years ago, comparatively,\r\nit was impossible to kill hogs for packing purposes, except during the\r\nwinter season, and the various packing plants located throughout the\r\ncountry worked during the winter months in their crude way, packing as\r\nmany hogs as conditions would permit, turning out the cured meat in the\r\nspring, in inferior condition.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions then existing there was little of the hog sold\r\nfresh, for being killed as they were, in isolated places, there was\r\nlittle opportunity to make it available for general consumption,\r\nconsequently fresh pork was sold only in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nslaughtering place and it was necessary to cure the balance. Under\r\npresent methods, fresh pork product is shipped to England and delivered\r\nin good condition to the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe important step in the evolution of “all-the-year packing” from\r\n“winter packing” was the introduction of the refrigerating machine,\r\nand in packing houses today little or no regard is paid to the outside\r\ntemperature. Another great advantage is the transportation facilities\r\nnow available. When killing hogs in large quantities the fresh pork\r\nproduct is sold fresh and consumed as such, and a much greater revenue\r\nis derived than when salted as formerly, and sold as cured meats. With\r\nthe present facilities for distribution the public can buy fresh pork\r\nat any time of the year, while a few years ago it was impossible to\r\nobtain it at any price during warmer seasons, unless in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of the place where the animals were slaughtered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--UNLOADING HOGS FROM CAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Investment.=--The investment capital used in pork packing is\r\nmuch greater than for beef, for in slaughtering cattle there is\r\ncomparatively little left that requires storage, but in slaughtering\r\nhogs fully seventy per cent of the carcass goes into the curing\r\ndepartment, to stay from thirty to ninety days; consequently a much\r\nlarger and more expensive set of buildings is required than for\r\nslaughtering cattle. For instance, in the matter of chill room it is\r\ncustomary to require cooler space for twice or three times the killing\r\ncapacity and storage area equal to five times the hog hanging area;\r\nin other words, if a plant was to be built to kill a thousand hogs a\r\nday there should be hanging capacity for 2,500 and five times the floor\r\narea should be sufficient for curing the product, providing it is sold\r\npromptly as cured. If it is to be carried for any length of time a\r\ngreater ratio than five to one should be used. This, of course, does\r\nnot refer to any of the auxiliary departments of the plant but only to\r\nthe cold storage and chill room department.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hog Yarding.=--Hogs should be rested in closed covered pens arranged\r\nfor summer ventilation, and winter warmth. It is essential that they be\r\nwell rested and cooled before they are slaughtered. To rest twenty-four\r\nhours is by no means detrimental. In driving provide the driver with a\r\nflat canvass belt attached to a short wooden handle so that the hogs\r\nare not abused by clubbing. Keep plenty of water in the troughs and\r\nkeep pens clean.\r\n\r\nMore care should be used in handling hogs than any other live stock, as\r\nhogs are more easily injured. Special pens should be provided for their\r\nreception. Hogs should never be killed until they are thoroughly rested\r\nand in normal condition. In the summer weather they should be sprinkled.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hog Dressing.=--The principal points for attention in hog slaughtering\r\nare briefly referred to under the following headings.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hoisting.=--When passing to the catch pens for hoisting, the pen\r\nfloor should be arranged with raised or corrugated surfaces to avoid\r\nthe possibility of its becoming slippery and the hogs “spreading” as\r\na result. The hogs should be headed in such a direction that when the\r\nshackle is attached to the wheel the hind quarter of the hogs are the\r\nfirst to move upward, without unduly twisting or wrenching the hog.\r\nThe transfer to the sticking rail should be done smoothly and without\r\njerking.\r\n\r\nA hoist, shown in Fig. 102, is often used; it is not only a very useful\r\ndevice but it is also economical from the fact that it does not jar or\r\ninjure the hogs when hung up, as is often the case with an ordinary\r\nhand hoist. This particular machine is adapted for small slaughter\r\nhouses rather than where business is done on a large scale, in which\r\ncase a double machine will be found almost indispensable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--DIAGRAM OF COVERED PEN FOR HOGS AND SHEEP WITH\r\nDETAIL OF CONSTRUCTION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--ELEVATION FOR COVERED PEN FOR HOGS AND SHEEP\r\nWITH DETAIL OF FENCE AND GATE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--HOGS RESTING AND COOLING OFF BEFORE BEING\r\nTAKEN TO THE SLAUGHTERING HOIST.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sticking.=--Make a large and free opening. To insert a knife and make\r\na slit only large enough to admit it is insufficient. The sticker’s\r\nknife should be sharpened on both front and back and when it is\r\nwithdrawn, a long smooth opening four or five inches long should\r\nbe made. It is far better, as hogs bleed more freely and die much\r\nsooner. Be careful to see that the veins and arteries are cut, and at\r\nthe same time do not cut into the shoulder, as in that instance the\r\nblood settles there and it becomes necessary to trim, resulting in\r\nconsiderable loss. See that sufficient hogs are kept on the rail so\r\nthat they may bleed out well before dropping in the tub. The sticker\r\nshould keep close to the hanging off--sticking the hogs immediately\r\nupon hanging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--HOISTING HOGS ON A HURFORD REVOLVING WHEEL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Neck Washing.=--Where space is available a washing spray of cold water\r\nto drench the forequarters, head and feet, is a great advantage, as\r\nthe washing of the blood enables better scalding and makes for cleaner\r\nhands and feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scalding.=--See that the tub is long enough to permit carrying a\r\ncomparatively low temperature and a good soaking of the hogs. This will\r\nassist very materially in the removal of the hair, either by hand or by\r\nmachine. The scalding water should be alkaline, by the use of potash\r\nor lime. It should be kept at an even temperature and the hogs put in\r\nsystematically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--HURFORD SMALL HOG HOIST.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scraping Machines.=--There are a variety of mechanical scrapers on\r\nthe market, and the output of goods per hour is perhaps the guide\r\nin selecting a scraper for a large output. All things considered, a\r\nvertical type barrel equipment, with scraping arms, delivering the\r\nhog into a horizontal beater type would appear as the most efficient\r\nand the less expensive for up-keep. The up-keep on a hog scraper is a\r\nmatter of no small figure and is worthy of careful consideration in the\r\nselection of the equipment. In small plants, the choice is a matter of\r\npersonal preference, the beater types being probably the most popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hand Scraping.=--Hair should be scraped out when possible in\r\npreference to cutting off by shaving. A bench is provided following the\r\nscraper for the finishing touches in this respect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103--STICKING AND BLEEDING HOGS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Body Cleaning.=--A most important feature in dressing hogs is the\r\nmatter of getting the hair off, the skin cleaned and washed before\r\nopening the hog. Inspection requirements as to cleanliness practically\r\ndemand this, and it is a proper method of dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ham Facing and Cutting.=--In ham facing care should be used to see\r\nthat the workmen cut off the fat down to the lean meat, and at the same\r\ntime do not cut the striffen. In opening the hog it is requisite that\r\nthe opening cut should be a straight line from the stickers cut to the\r\nbung. The breast splitting and opening over breast bone is made so as\r\nto equally divide the sides and avoid trimming when cutting hogs; the\r\nintestines are removed without cutting or breaking.\r\n\r\nFIG. 104.--HOG SCALDING.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leaf Lard.=--Pulling the leaf lard just before the splitting, should\r\nbe done with care in order that the leaves may be pulled clean.\r\n\r\nIf this operation is performed in an indifferent manner, a considerable\r\namount of the leaf lard will be left in the carcasses and it is\r\nafterward scraped out. Lard left after pulling the leaf, should be\r\nscraped out, as it is often worth more as lard than if left as meat.\r\nIts presence greatly disfigures the meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Splitting.=--This should be done carefully and accurately through the\r\nbackbone. A wide blade chopper is by all means preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Washing.=--The hog when once cleaned, and after eviscerating and\r\nbefore splitting or pulling the leaf lard, should not be washed further\r\nunless it be on the neck, since water on split backs is detrimental to\r\nthe keeping quality of pork loins.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drying.=--Few appreciate the value and importance of “skin drying”\r\nhogs by dry-shaving and dry-scraping the surface. The advantage to\r\nrefrigerating more than overcomes the initial cost of the labor\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--HOG SCRAPING GANG AT WORK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Care in Chill Room.=--It is in this particular part of the house\r\nthat the most careful and minute attention to details is necessary\r\nin order to turn out meats in the best marketable condition, as only\r\na few degree deviation in temperatures from carefully set rules in\r\nthe handling of chill rooms, shows excess per cent of sour meat found\r\nthirty to sixty days afterward, when the meats are brought from the\r\ncuring cellar. This, therefore, is a department that should receive\r\nthe most careful attention. A wrong start here can never be righted\r\nafterward. The rule for operation is previously given under another\r\nchapter. (See Chapter on Coolers).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--CLEANING HOG CARCASSES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Open Air Hanging.=--It was formerly considered a necessity to have\r\nan open-air hanging room where hogs could dry after slaughtering,\r\nin many cases allowing them to hang over night; the object being to\r\nsave refrigeration. It is the common opinion that the economy thus\r\nobtained is anything but economy. Past experience has proved that there\r\nare certain conditions which must be adhered to closely in the safe\r\nhandling and curing of pork products, and proper temperatures are among\r\nthe most important of these. It is very rare that these temperatures\r\nprevail in the outside atmosphere, and hogs that are left on hanging\r\nfloor over night are either insufficiently chilled or over-chilled.\r\nMany packers feel it advantageous, however, to run hogs into a hanging\r\nroom, allowing them to dry out for one or two hours prior to putting\r\nthem in the chill room. While this has no deteriorating effect on the\r\nproduct, the expense of handling them and the cost of labor incurred is\r\nabout equal to the saving in refrigeration, if they are put directly\r\ninto the chill room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--SCRAPING LEAF LARD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chilling Necessities.=--The essential feature in a chill room is\r\nthat it be properly constructed and have sufficient refrigeration so\r\nthat the temperatures can be controlled precisely as desired. It is\r\nadvisable that the coolers be partitioned into tunnels. Into this the\r\nhogs are run as fast as killed, providing that the temperature is not\r\nrun up too high. If the temperature goes above 45° F., the carcasses\r\nshould be run into another tunnel and placed in the first one as the\r\ntemperature goes down.\r\n\r\nWhen the carcasses are to be cut after being forty-eight hours in\r\nthe chill room, the cooler should be brought down gradually to a\r\ntemperature of 28° F. If they are to be cut when seventy-two hours old,\r\nwhich from the author’s experience is preferable, the cooler should\r\nbe brought down gradually to a temperature of 30° F. With a cooler\r\nproperly equipped, and a careful attendant, these instructions can be\r\ncarried out in detail, and when thus followed the safe curing of the\r\nproduct will be found to be practically assured.\r\n\r\nWhile there are other matters which need careful attention, if the\r\nchilling is not done properly, the rest of the operation will never\r\nsave the product. The cooler should at all times be kept dry and clean\r\nwith dry sawdust on the floor, to absorb drippings, clots of blood,\r\netc., from the carcasses; whereas, if the drippings are allowed to\r\nremain on the floor they soon become soured and a menace to the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shrinkage in Chill Rooms.=--The question is often raised as to how\r\nmuch hogs shrink in the cooler from dressed warm weight to chilled\r\nweight, and many people figure this shrinkage represents a loss. It\r\nis a variable quantity depending upon conditions such as the dryness\r\nof the hogs, the quantity of the air circulation, its temperature and\r\nother agents. If the hogs be sold whole plant weights it represents a\r\nloss, but no cooler can be controlled to prevent shrinkage if it be\r\nworking properly. Aside from this quite a proportion of the hog is\r\npassed to curing rooms for treatment in salt or pickle and the original\r\ninherent moisture is hardly a traceable factor here and also the\r\nshrinkage in that portion rendered into lard is immaterial, while the\r\nportion shipped as fresh pork must be well dried out to arrive in good\r\ncondition upon shipment.\r\n\r\nThe following figures give an idea of the actual shrinkage of hogs\r\nplaced directly in the coolers. It will be noted the tests were made\r\non light hogs used for shipping purposes. The percentage of shrinkage\r\nwould not be as great on heavier carcasses:\r\n\r\n  =TEST NO. 1 ON SHRINKAGE OF HOGS IN COOLER.=\r\n\r\n  =Forty-five hogs weighed in cooler direct from killing floor--Warm\r\n  weight, 6,892 pounds; average, 153 pounds; temperature of cooler, 51°\r\n  to 48° F.=\r\n\r\n  =Weight after hanging in cooler forty-eight hours, 6,682 pounds;\r\n  shrinkage of 210 pounds or 3.04 per cent; temperature of cooler, 35°\r\n  to 36° F.=\r\n\r\n  =Weight after hanging cooler seventy-two hours, 6,570 pounds;\r\n  shrinkage of 322 pounds or 4.67 per cent; temperature of cooler, 31°\r\n  to 32° F.=\r\n\r\n  =Weight after hanging in cooler ninety-four and one-half hours, 6,552\r\n  pounds; shrinkage of 340 pounds or 4.93 per cent; temperature of\r\n  cooler, 32° F.=\r\n\r\n  =TEST NO. 2.=\r\n\r\n  =Forty-five hogs weighed into cooler direct from killing floor--Warm\r\n  weight, 6,970 pounds; average, 155 pounds; temperature of cooler, 54°\r\n  F.=\r\n\r\n  =Weight after hanging in cooler forty-six hours, 6,660 pounds;\r\n  shrinkage of 310 pounds or 4.45 per cent; temperature of cooler, 36°\r\n  F.=\r\n\r\n  =Weight after hanging in cooler seventy-two hours, 6,623 pounds;\r\n  shrinkage, 347 pounds or 4.97 per cent; temperature of cooler, 32° F.=\r\n\r\n  =Weight after hanging in cooler ninety-four hours, 6,613 pounds;\r\n  shrinkage, 357 pounds or 5.12 per cent; temperature or cooler, 32° F.=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hog By-Products.=--These consist of the heads, plucks and entrails,\r\nand so much ingenuity is being used to make commercial products\r\nthereof, that nearly as much labor is expended upon these parts as upon\r\nthe dressing of the hog.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heads.=--The heads are best made free from hair before severing from\r\nthe carcass. If the loose hair is properly removed before the head is\r\ndropped, there is far less likelihood of hair coming in contact with\r\ncheek meat and tongues, from which parts it is difficult to hand pick.\r\n\r\nThe heads cleaned, they are skinned, the tongue is taken out, cheek\r\nmeat cut off, jaws pulled, brains removed from skulls, skull frame cut\r\ninto, to separate the teeth section and upper part of skull, cleansed\r\nof lithoids; snouts and ears are separated from face pieces and\r\nprepared for food products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plucks.=--Plucks are separated into livers, lungs and hearts. The\r\nhearts are used as sausage meat. The livers are selected for quality\r\nand many sold at retail. Defective livers are used for meat meal or\r\ndigester tankage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hog Paunches.=--Thoroughly clean, strip from fat, remove lining for\r\nsale to pepsin factories. Hog pouches are used for head cheese stuffing\r\nor cleaned like tripe for sheep sausage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Entrail Fats.=--All entrail fats are satisfactory for use in prime\r\nsteam lard if properly cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nPORK CUTTINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n  HOG CUTTING -- VARIETY AND CLASSES OF HOGS -- CUTTING FLOOR -- PORK\r\n  CUTS -- HAMS -- SIDE MEATS -- BELLIES -- BACKS -- LOINS -- SHOULDERS\r\n  -- BUTTS AND PLATES -- PERCENTAGE OF YIELD -- CHANGE CUTS ONE SIDE --\r\n  TEST ON FIVE SIDES -- COMPLETE CUTTING TEST.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hog Cutting.=--The division of a carcass into its parts for disposal\r\nof fresh pork and for curing purposes, is a part of the expert work in\r\nthe packing house business. The cuts placed in the curing cellar for\r\nshipment six or seven months hence and a prognostication as to what cut\r\nwill meet a favorable future market; the sale, etc. are true problems.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of standard cuts, however, that are usually readily\r\ndisposed of. A description of the various cuts, etc. is given herein.\r\nUse is made of much valuable data collected and published in the\r\nIllinois State Agricultural Department Bulletin previously referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Variety and Classes of Hogs.=--A day’s buying of hogs unless selected\r\nto yield a given quality, is likely to yield the following classes:\r\n\r\n                                   Carcass Weights\r\n  Smooth Heavy or Heavy Loin Hogs   240 to 400 lb.\r\n  Butcher or Light Loin Hogs        160 to 240 lb.\r\n  Packing Hogs                      100 to 400 lb.\r\n  Bacon or Marked Hogs               90 to 170 lb.\r\n  Shippers                          100 to 200 lb.\r\n  Pigs                               20 to 100 lb.\r\n\r\nDifferent styles of dressing are characteristic of the different\r\nclasses of carcasses except heavy and light loin hogs, and shippers and\r\npigs. Dressed hogs of all classes are cut open along the underline and\r\nthrough the aitch-bone and brisket, but the method of splitting and\r\ntrimming varies with the class, as follows:\r\n\r\n“_Loin Hogs._--These are split down through the center of the back-bone\r\n(‘loin-split’ or ‘center-split’) in order that pork loins may be cut\r\nfrom the sides. They are dressed “packer style,” i. e., head off, leaf\r\nout and hams faced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Inside.\r\n  Outside.\r\n\r\nFIG. 108.--SMOOTH HEAVY HOGS.]\r\n\r\n“_Packing Hogs._--Are usually split like loin hogs; sometimes on one\r\nside of the back bone, making a hard and soft side.\r\n\r\n“_Bacon Hogs._--Or those used for English meats are usually dressed\r\n‘marked’; that is, a knife is passed down each side of the back bone\r\nand the backbone removed. The hogs are dressed regular unless the ham\r\nis intended for a long cut ham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--BUTCHER HOGS. =~A~=, HEAVY. =~B~=, LIGHT.]\r\n\r\n“_Smooth Heavy or Heavy Loin Hogs._--The following description is of\r\nthe usual commercial selection of hogs: These are prime smooth hogs,\r\neither barrows or good, clear (not seedy) sows, weighing 240 to 400\r\npounds, with from four to six inches of fat on the back; thick, wide,\r\nlevel sides without depressions in the back; heavy hams, filled out\r\neven with sides, full at the rump and well rounded down toward hocks,\r\nwithout flabbiness. As their name indicates such hogs are suitable for\r\nheavy loins. The remainder of the sides are being used for heavy short\r\nclears or fat backs and bellies.\r\n\r\n“_Butcher or Light Loin Hogs._--A large proportion of the fresh pork\r\nsold in retail markets is pork loins, which are cut into chops and\r\nroasts; hence light loin or ‘pork loin’ hogs are those from which these\r\ncuts can be obtained to best advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--PACKING HOGS (SOWS). =~A~=, HEAVY. =~B~=,\r\nMEDIUM.]\r\n\r\n“To yield loins of the proper size and quality, a hog carcass should\r\nweigh about 160 to 240 pounds and have the same shape, smoothness and\r\ngeneral quality described for heavy loin hogs. The covering of fat\r\nshould be two to four inches thick on the back. This class is composed\r\nof barrows and smooth, clear sows. The weights most preferred for\r\nbutcher hogs are 200 to 220 pounds. They are principally cut up by\r\npackers, the loins being sold to retail dealers or jobbers. Besides\r\nloins, fat backs, clear bellies, extra ribs and extra short clears are\r\ncommonly made from sides of butcher hogs. The hams are cut short and\r\nthe shoulders principally made into picnics, New York-cut shoulders and\r\nBoston butts. In some instances carcasses of this class are sold to\r\nretail markets for fresh trade, in which case they are dressed either\r\n‘head on’ or ‘head off’ as ordered. (See Fig. 109.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--CHOICE BACON HOGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--PORK CUTS.\r\n\r\n  English Cuts.\r\n\r\n  A, Long cut ham.\r\n  B, Long side or middle.\r\n\r\n  Domestic Cuts.\r\n\r\n  1.

All heavy hogs that are too rough to\r\nbe classed as loin hogs are included in this grade. Defects common to\r\nthese carcasses are thick, rough and wrinkled skin, dark-colored and\r\ncoarse-grained flesh, soft, oil fat, large bones and carcass bruises.\r\n(Fig. 110.) They are more largely cut into short ribs and mess pork,\r\nand less into loins, fat backs and bellies than Heavy Loin Hogs, and\r\nconsequently are more frequently ‘marked’ and side-split although at\r\ntimes a large proportion of them are loin-split and pork loins taken\r\nout. The hams are sweet pickled and shoulders made into picnics and\r\nBoston butts.\r\n\r\n“_Marked Hogs._--Light marked hogs are those that are suitable\r\nprimarily for sugarcured breakfast-bacon bellies and ‘English’ meats.\r\nSince such meats must be comparatively lean, firm and of good quality,\r\nthe leading features of bacon hogs are long, deep, smooth sides with\r\na light, even covering of fat over the entire carcass and especially\r\nuniform on the back and sides. The hams should be full but lean and\r\nthe shoulders light and smooth. The flesh must be firm, the fat solid\r\nand the carcass sufficiently mature to insure proper curing. Hogs\r\nwhich fulfil these conditions weigh 90 to 170 pounds dressed. The most\r\ndesirable weights are 120 to 150 pounds. They consist principally of\r\nbarrows, but for most grades of bacon, smooth clear sows that resemble\r\nbarrows in general quality and finish are used to some extent. The\r\nproducts principally made from them are ‘English’ middles, backs and\r\nbellies, domestic breakfast-bacon bellies, long-cut and short-cut hams.\r\nBacon hogs vary from choice to common in quality, finish and shape,\r\nalthough no fixed grades are universally recognized among packers. This\r\ngrade is used for the manufacture of ‘Wiltshire’ and ‘Staffordshire’\r\nsides, ‘English’ backs and bellies, and fancy breakfast-bacon bellies,\r\nalso ‘Cumberland’ sides to some extent. They weigh about 120 to 160\r\npounds.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cutting Floors.=--The hogs thoroughly chilled are ready for the\r\ncutting room. To be safe, however, the hogs should show a temperature\r\nof from 34° to 36° F. inside of the hams and shoulders. If this\r\ntemperature in the meat has been reached by gradual chilling, very\r\nlittle trouble should be experienced in curing the meats. The proper\r\ncutting of the hog carcass is one of the most important items in\r\nthe economical handling of hogs. The great variety of cuts and the\r\npercentage of yield of the various cuts are given on succeeding\r\npages. For cutting and trimming economically it is essential that\r\nsuitable facilities be provided. A cutting floor must be laid out for\r\nthe quantity to be handled and for the style of meats to be cut. The\r\ncarcass being heavy, the use of slides, conveyor mechanical saws, etc.,\r\nare resorted to.\r\n\r\nIn hog cutting floors of large capacity the arrangement is usually on\r\nthree floors or decks, the parts gravitating in the movement toward\r\na finished cut. It is preferable to do the cutting in a cooled room\r\nin most climates and where a uniform temperature of 40° to 45° can\r\nbe maintained. Lower temperature would be better but it is difficult\r\nto keep working people satisfied, particularly where female help is\r\nemployed, for trimming purposes.\r\n\r\nBe it said that moisture and heat are not conducive to the keeping\r\nquality of meats and it is to be avoided. The handling of cold meat in\r\nwarm rooms brings about this condition, consequently it is far better\r\nto avoid exposure in cutting hogs into the several parts.\r\n\r\nThe usual method is to remove the ham, preferably by knife and hand\r\nsaw; to chop the shoulder, further separated by power saw; to pull the\r\nloin and pass the side on for separation to backs and bellies. The\r\nfurther finishing of the cuts, either immediately on separation from\r\nthe side or in an adjacent room, is a matter of space available.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pork Cuts.=--Fresh pork cuts are taken more or less from all classes\r\nof hogs. Since the pork loin is by far the leading fresh cut, light\r\nloin hogs are more extensively used for fresh pork than any other\r\nclass. The varying demand for loins determines to a considerable\r\nextent the method of cutting other classes of hogs from time to time.\r\nTenderloins and spareribs are also primarily fresh cuts. Skinned\r\nshoulders, shoulder butts, hams, bellies, fat backs, and raw leaf fat\r\nare sold fresh to a small extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Skinned Ham.\r\n  Second Brand.\r\n  First Brand.\r\n  Third Brand.\r\n\r\nFIG. 113--SHORT CUT HAMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--SMOKED SHORT CUT HAMS--FIRST BRAND.]\r\n\r\nThe grading of pork cuts is complex since it involves their quality,\r\nshape, proportions of fat and lean, and weight. Many of the grade names\r\nrefer merely to different methods of cutting and curing; but since they\r\nare applied only to cuts of specified quality, thickness or weight,\r\nthe grades are in reality based on the latter factors to a large\r\nextent. The various cuts differ considerably as to methods of grading;\r\nconsequently an adequate explanation of the factors involved and their\r\nrelative importance can be presented only by describing the grades of\r\neach class.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hams.=--Hams are of two general kinds, short-cut and long-cut. The\r\nformer are made from comparatively fat, plump hams, trimmed short and\r\nround at the butt, and the shank cut off at the hock joint. They are\r\nsold either as Regular Short-Cut, Skinned, or Boneless Rolled Hams.\r\nLong-cut hams are lean, long hams, with the butt left full and the foot\r\ntaken off at the first joint below the hock. The principal grades are\r\nRegular Long-Cut, Stafford Cut, Manchester Cut and Italian Cut Hams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short-Cut or American Cut Hams._--These are cut from the side midway\r\nbetween the hench-bone and slip-bone,[A] trimmed round at the butt,\r\ncushion[B] faced full, not undercut on the skin side, and shank cut off\r\nin or above the hock joint. Until 1909 the Board of Trade required that\r\nthe shank be cut above the hock so as to expose the marrow. Practically\r\nall hams are sold as sweet-pickled or smoked meats. For regular\r\ndelivery on the Chicago Board of Trade as sweet-pickled hams, they must\r\naverage, in lots, not to exceed 16 pounds, with no ham to weigh less\r\nthan 12 pounds and none to weigh over twenty pounds. The short-cut hams\r\nis the leading ham cut and has to a large extent taken the place of the\r\nlong-cut ham in export trade.\r\n\r\n  [A] The hench-bone is the flat portion of the hip-bone that remains\r\n  attached to the socket joint of the ham when the hog is split. The\r\n  slip bone is the portion of the hip-bone that lies in contact with\r\n  the back-bone near the end of the loin.\r\n\r\n  [B] The cushion is the fat butt of the ham where the tail piece is\r\n  cut off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--BONELESS ROLLED HAMS.]\r\n\r\nShort-cut hams are graded by packers according to the brand of smoked\r\nhams for which they are suitable. For the first brand (known as “extra\r\nselected” or “fancy-cured” hams) they are selected for thickness\r\nand firmness of lean meat, plump, well rounded shape, solid, white\r\nfat or medium thickness (one to two inches on a medium-weight ham),\r\nsmooth, soft skin, bright color, small shank and absence of bruises.\r\nThe bulk of this grade weigh 10 to 16 pounds, 10 to 12 pounds being\r\nmost desirable for family trade, and 14 to 16 pounds for hotels\r\nand restaurants. See Fig. 113. Second brand or second grade hams\r\n(frequently termed No. 1’s) are deficient in one or more of the points\r\njust mentioned, but must be reasonably good in general quality and not\r\nexceedingly deficient in any particular. Many of them are too fat for\r\nthe first brand. The third brand (also known as “seconds”), includes\r\nthose from which a skin-bruise has been removed, also thin, light hams\r\nand any others which lack the shape and quality required for regular\r\nmeat market trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Regular.\r\n  Manchester.\r\n  Stafford.\r\n  Italian.\r\n\r\nFIG. 116.--LONG CUT HAMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Short Rib.\r\n  Extra Short Rib.\r\n  Short Clear.\r\n  Extra Short Clear.\r\n\r\nFIG. 117.--SIDES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skinned Hams._--These are cut short as explained above, the skin is\r\nremoved down to the shank and the fat trimmed off within one inch of\r\nthe lean. Until 1909 the Board of Trade regulation required the fat to\r\nbe trimmed off within one-half inch of the lean. They are made from fat\r\nhams of first and second grades, weighing from 12 to 30 pounds, but the\r\nbulk weigh 16 to 22 pounds. Many skin-bruised hams are also skinned in\r\norder to remove bruises.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boneless Rolled Hams._--These are made from sweet-pickled short-cut\r\nhams by lifting the skin, removing the surplus fat and the bone, and\r\npressing or tying in the form of a roll with skin on. They are also\r\nmade from skinned hams. 15 to 26-pound hams of first and second brands\r\nare used. These are usually prepared from cured hams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Regular Long Cut Hams._--These are lean, long hams with only one-half\r\nto one and one-half inches of outside fat, and are “cut from the\r\nside by separating with a knife the hip-bone from the rump, properly\r\nrounded, foot unjointed at first joint below the hock.” They are not\r\nfaced; and the butt end is left full, which gives it a flat, lean\r\nappearance. (Fig. 116.) Average weights are 10 to 20 pounds but usually\r\nabove 14 pounds. This cut is made from good and choice bacon hogs.\r\n“Yorkshire” or “York” hams are cut slightly longer at the butt than\r\nregular, but are otherwise as described above. “Smithfield” or Virginia\r\nStyle hams are long-cut and very lean, dry salt cured, long smoking,\r\nspiced, and “aged” for several months before using. They weigh 9 to 18\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n“Stafford” Hams are cut about two inches shorter at the butt end than\r\nregular long-cut hams, hench-bone taken out exposing the socket joint,\r\nand foot cut off at the first joint below the hock. They are cut from\r\ngood and choice bacon hogs and cured for English trade. This grade is\r\nmade principally from 14 to 18-pound hams. See Fig. 116.\r\n\r\n“Manchester” Hams are a very lean grade of long-cut hams comparatively\r\nflat in shape, butted like “Staffords,” and averaging 14 to 18 pounds.\r\nSee Fig. 116.\r\n\r\n“Italian” Hams are very thin, long hams, of 9 to 18-pounds average,\r\nand of common to good quality. The hench-bone is removed as from\r\n“Staffords,” the leg is left extra long, the butt trimmed like American\r\nor short-cut hams, the ham pressed flat, dry-salt cured, smoked dark\r\nand seasoned with pepper. See Fig. 116.\r\n\r\nNumerous other styles of grades of hams which were formerly packed in\r\nlarge quantities, especially for export trade, are no longer made or\r\nused sufficiently to be regarded as standard products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Side Meats.=--This class includes various grades and cuts of Short\r\nRibs, Short Clears and “English” Bacon Sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short Rib Sides._--Regular Short Ribs are middles of hogs from which\r\nshort-cut hams and regular or New York shoulders have been taken off,\r\nwith back-bone and tenderloin removed, hench-bone and breast-bone\r\nsawed or cut down smooth and even with face of side, feather of blade\r\nnot removed and no incision made in the side. This is a regular Board\r\nof Trade cut and is quoted in provision reports simply as “Ribs.” It\r\nis made from medium to heavy packing hogs, in averages from 25 to 80\r\npounds, but principally from 45 to 65 pounds. On the Board of Trade\r\nregular ribs averaging not less than 30 nor more than 60 pounds are\r\ndeliverable at contract price; those over 60 and not over 70 pounds\r\naverage are deliverable at a discount of 20 cents per 100 pounds; those\r\nover 70 and not over 80 pounds are discounted 30 cents, per 100 pounds.\r\nRegular ribs are mainly shipped south either as dry-salt or bacon meat.\r\nMany are afterward converted into other cuts, as extra ribs, extra\r\nclears, backs and bellies, as determined by current prices of the\r\nvarious cuts.\r\n\r\nJobbing or Rough Short Ribs consist of short ribs with the back-bone\r\nleft in, the hog being center-split leaving equal part of the back-bone\r\non each side. They are sold at a discount of two per cent under regular\r\nribs and must average not less than 30 nor more than 50 pounds for\r\nBoard of Trade delivery.\r\n\r\nHard Short Ribs are made the same as Jobbing Ribs except that the\r\nhog is split so as to leave the back-bone all on one side. The side\r\ncontaining the back-bone is known as the Hard Side or Hard Short Rib\r\nand the other as the Soft Side, the latter being the same as the\r\nRegular Short Rib. They usually weigh 50 to 70 pounds, are cut from\r\nheavy packing hogs and are sold principally in the South as dry-salt\r\npork.\r\n\r\nExtra Short Ribs or “Extra Ribs” are made from Short Ribs by removing\r\nthe loin. They average 35 to 50 pounds. 20 to 30 per cent of the stocks\r\nof sides usually consist of Extra Ribs.\r\n\r\nSquare Cut or “English” Short Ribs are the middles of hogs from which\r\nsquare shoulders and long-cut hams have been cut, thus making the side\r\nshorter than a regular rib, square-cut and with the feather of the\r\nblade-bone out. They are selected from the better grades of medium\r\nweight packing hogs, and average 20 to 30 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short Clear Sides._--Regular Short Clears are made from regular short\r\nribs by removing the ribs and cutting reasonably square at each end.\r\nThey are graded and handled in the same manner as short ribs. Short\r\nClears average 30 to 70 pounds and to grade regular must average not\r\nless than 35 pounds. It is primarily a domestic cut but is exported to\r\nsome extent. Square-Cut Short Clears are the same as Square-Cut Short\r\nRibs except the ribs are taken out.\r\n\r\nExtra Short Clear Sides or “Extra Clears” are made the same as short\r\nclears except that the loin is also removed. They may be made from\r\nextra short ribs by cutting out the ribs. The pieces weigh 25 to 60\r\npounds, and must average not less than 30 nor more than 60 pounds to\r\ngrade regular.\r\n\r\n\r\n_“English” Bacon Sides._--These so-called sides or long middles include\r\nboth the side and shoulder, and in one instance (Wiltshires) the ham is\r\nalso included. After arrival in Great Britain, they are usually made\r\ninto “rolled sides,” which are dried for English trade, but in Scotland\r\nare usually smoked.\r\n\r\n“Wiltshire” Sides consist of the side, ham and shoulder left together\r\nin one piece; the blade-bone is taken out, foot cut off, the\r\nshoulder trimmed the same as “Cumberlands,” hip-bone taken out, not\r\nbackstrapped, the belly trimmed smooth and even, and leg of the ham\r\ncut off below the hock joint. These sides average 40 to 70 pounds and\r\nare selected especially for thickness of lean meat with a light, even\r\ncovering of fat from 1¹⁄₄ to 2 inches thick, not exceeding 1³⁄₄ inches\r\nin the best grades. They are made exclusively from choice lean bacon\r\nhogs, and are the highest grade of English bacon sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--SHORT RIBS. CUT FOR MESS PORK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Heavy.\r\n  Medium.\r\n  Light.\r\n\r\nFIG. 119.--PORK LOINS.]\r\n\r\n“Cumberland Sides” have the end from which the ham is taken cut\r\nsquare; the leg cut off below the knee joint; the shoulder ribs,\r\nneckbone, back-bone and blood vein taken out; breast-bone sawed or\r\ncut down smooth and even with the face of the side; and should not be\r\nback-strapped or flanked. They are made from good and choice bacon hogs\r\nand average 20 to 60 pounds, but the bulk run 25 to 40 pounds. This is\r\nby far the leading export side cut, and being made in various grades\r\nand averages is suitable for converting into other English side cuts,\r\nsuch as “Yorkshires,” “Birminghams,” “Staffords.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Wiltshire.\r\n  Cumberland.\r\n  Dublin.\r\n\r\n  Long clear.\r\n  Yorkshire.\r\n  Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nFIG. 120.--LONG SIDES.]\r\n\r\nLong Rib Sides are made from the same as Cumberlands except the\r\nshoulder bones are taken out and the leg cut off close to the breast.\r\nThe average weight is 18 to 25 pounds.\r\n\r\nLong Clear Sides are cut the same as long ribs and in addition have\r\nthe ribs taken out. For English trade, they are made from good bacon\r\nhogs weighing 120 to 160 pounds dressed, and the sides weigh 18 to\r\n26 pounds. For regular Board of Trade delivery they must not average\r\nless than 45 pounds. The latter are used in domestic trade and\r\nContinental Europe, and are made from the heaviest bacon hogs and from\r\ncomparatively lean butcher hogs. Extra long clears are made like long\r\nclears except that the loin is also removed. They are seldom used.\r\n\r\n“Dublin” Middles are thin lean sides cut like “Cumberlands” and in\r\naddition the leg cut off close to the breast. They are made from light,\r\ncommon bacon hogs and pigs. The sides weigh 12 to 20 pounds. See Fig.\r\n120.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bellies.=--The grades of this cut are Dry-Salt, Sweet-Pickle,\r\nBreakfast-Bacon and “English” Bellies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dry Salt Bellies._--These are made from short rib sides of mixed\r\npacking hogs by cutting off the back. For delivery on the Board of\r\nTrade they must be “Well cut and trimmed; no bellies that are coarse,\r\nbruised, soft or unsound shall be accepted.” However, they are not as\r\nclosely trimmed as sweet-pickle bellies. They are made in averages from\r\n10 to 45 pounds. They are quoted as Dry-Salt Rib and Dry-Salt Clear\r\nBellies, the latter having the ribs removed and being made usually from\r\nbellies weighing less than 25 pounds. When smoked they are known as\r\n“Bacon Meats.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sweet-Pickle Bellies._--These are made from butcher bacon and good\r\npacking hogs, being “well cut and trimmed, to average, in lots, not to\r\nexceed 14 pounds.” The edges are squared and trimmed more closely than\r\nDry-Salt bellies. They are made in 6 to 14 pound averages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Breakfast-Bacon Bellies._--These are clear bellies cut from bacon or\r\nlight butcher hogs and selected with reference to firmness, color,\r\nproportions of fat and lean, smooth skin and general quality. They\r\nare trimmed still more closely than the regular sweet-pickle bellies.\r\nSelected bellies of this class weighing 4 to 10 pounds are known as\r\nFancy or Special Breakfast Bacon Bellies and are made into the best\r\nbrands of sugar-cured breakfast-bacon. The second brand includes\r\nbellies that are too fat for fancy bacon, or which lack the necessary\r\nfirmness of flesh and thin smooth skin. They weigh 4 to 16 pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dry Salt Rib.\r\n  Sweet Pickle Rib.\r\n  English Clear.\r\n  Sweet Pickle Clear.\r\n  Fancy Clear.\r\n\r\nFIG. 121.--BELLIES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  English Rib.\r\n  English Clear.\r\n  Short Fat Back.\r\n  Sweet Pickle Clear.\r\n\r\nFIG. 122.--BACKS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_“English” Bellies._--These are clear bellies weighing 10 to 20\r\npounds, cut from choice heavy bacon hogs and light butcher barrows,\r\nand selected for firmness and a large proportion of lean. They are cut\r\nsquare on all edges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--SMOKED BREAKFAST BACON BELLIES (FIRST BRAND).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Backs.=--The grades of backs are Short Ribs, Short Clear, Short Fat\r\nand Long Fat Backs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short Rib Backs._--These are made from short rib sides by cutting off\r\nthe belly; they therefore contain the loin, back fat and back-ribs but\r\nnot the back-bone nor tenderloin. It is a dry-salt cut, weighing 25 to\r\n45 pounds and is not commonly made. Hard Backs are made from hard rib\r\nsides, thus containing the back-bone. “English” Rib Backs are made from\r\nSquare Short Ribs, and average 12 to 20 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short Clear Backs._--These are “made from the sides of smooth hogs\r\nfrom which the bellies have been cut, back-bone and ribs taken out and\r\nthe lean left on, tail-bone sawed off even with the face of the meat,\r\nand trimmed smooth and square on all edges.” They are cut from medium\r\nand heavy packing hogs. The weights run from 16 to 40 pounds. “English”\r\nShort Clear Backs are lighter than regulars, averaging 10 to 20\r\npounds, and are shorter at the butt end, being cut off in front of the\r\nhip-bone. Pickled Clear Backs are short clear backs of light weight and\r\nlean quality. They weigh 6 to 10 pounds and are sweet-pickled, smoked,\r\nand sold as “Loin Back Bacon” or “Breakfast Bacon Backs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short Fat Backs._--These are “made from the sides of heavy,\r\nwell-fatted hogs from which the bellies have been cut, back-bone and\r\nribs taken out and all the lean taken off, to be trimmed smoothly and\r\nproperly squared on all the edges.” It is made from packing and loin\r\nhogs when cutting pork loins, and is usually quoted as a dry-salt cut\r\nin 8 to 20 pound averages.\r\n\r\nExport Short Fat Backs have the blade-bone taken out, are more closely\r\ntrimmed and squared than domestic fat backs and are made principally in\r\nheavy averages, 16 to 40 pounds. Paprika Fat Backs are thin, light fat\r\nbacks, weighing 4 to 8 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Long Fat Backs._--These consist of “the upper half of the side cut\r\nthrough the center of the ribs from the ham to and including the\r\nshoulder, with the loin and blade-bone taken out, trimmed smoothly and\r\nsquared on all edges.” It is a dry-salt cut, not as commonly made as\r\nformerly and used only for export trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Loins.=--Loins, consisting of the back with the fat trimmed off, are\r\nsold either as Regular Pork Loins or as Loin Rolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pork Loins._--These are made from sides of loin hogs, with the belly\r\nand back-fat cut off; they contain the back-bone, back-ribs and\r\ntenderloins, and have but a small amount of fat (one-fourth to one-half\r\ninch) on the outside. The weights of regular pork loins are 8 to 18\r\npounds and the price usually varies inversely with the weight. 14\r\npounds is the heaviest average generally used for fresh trade. Extra or\r\nLong Pork Loins include, in addition to the regular loin, the top or\r\nlean cut of the shoulder, but this cut is seldom made.\r\n\r\nTenderloins consist of short round muscles lying underneath and on each\r\nside of the back-bone; they are attached to the “slip-bone” and extend\r\nfrom the loin butt almost to the last rib. They weigh one-fourth to one\r\npound each, but those weighing three-fourths pound or over are most\r\nextensively used. They are cut from hogs that are too heavy and rough\r\nto yield regular pork loins, and from which short ribs, mess pork and\r\nboneless loins are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loin Rolls._--These are made from heavy loins (15 to 22 pounds) by\r\nboning them completely.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shoulders.=--The standard grades are Rough, Regular, Picnic, New York\r\nCut, Skinned, Square, New Orleans Cut and Boneless Rolled Shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rough Shoulders._--These are untrimmed shoulders as cut from the hog,\r\nseparated from the side between the first and second ribs and with the\r\njowl cut off square.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Regular Shoulders._--These are “cut as close as possible to the back\r\npart of the forearm joint without exposing the knuckle, (leaving two\r\nribs on the shoulder) butted off square on top, the neck-bone and short\r\nribs taken out, neck squared off, blood vein lifted and cut out, breast\r\nflap cut off on or above the knee joint.” They are made principally\r\nfrom hogs that are too heavy and rough for New York style shoulders,\r\nand at times when the supply of “picnics” exceeds the demand. Sausage\r\nShoulders are regular-cut shoulders which are unsuitable for dry-salt\r\nor sweet-pickle because of being trimmed to remove bruises, cut from\r\n“shoulder stuck” hogs, or otherwise deficient, and are used for the\r\npurpose which their name indicates. Bladed Shoulders are cut the same\r\nas Regulars except the shoulder-blade is taken out and the corners\r\nrounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Picnics or Calas._--Formerly termed California hams--These are cut\r\n2¹⁄₂ ribs wide, trimmed and packed as follows: “Shank cut off above the\r\nknee joint, trimmed as full on the face (lean surface) as possible,\r\nbutt taken off to the edge of the blade, well rounded at the butt\r\nin the shape of a ham, breast flap taken off, and trimmed close and\r\nsmooth, reasonably uniform in size, and to average, in lots, not to\r\nexceed 12 pounds. The lighter averages (4 to 8 pounds) are sometimes\r\ntermed Boston Shoulders, and were formerly butted shorter than Calas\r\nand only slightly rounded. Skinned Picnics are made from the fatter\r\ngrades of Picnics by removing the skin and trimming the fat off within\r\none-half inch of the lean. They average 6 to 10 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York Cut Shoulders._--These are cut two ribs wide, butted one inch\r\nfrom blade-bone, trimmed smooth, neck and breast flap cut off, and\r\nshank cut off between knee and brisket. 8 to 14-pound grades are made\r\nfor domestic trade and the bulk weigh 10 to 12 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skinned Shoulders._--These are cut similar to New York Cut Shoulders\r\nand in addition the skin is taken off down to the shank and the fat\r\ntrimmed off close to the lean. They weigh 6 to 16 pounds, and are sold\r\nfresh, sweet-pickled and smoked. Skinned shoulders with the shank cut\r\noff close to the breast are termed “Chicago Shoulders,” or “Skinned\r\nShoulders, hock off.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Square or 3-Rib Shoulders._--These are cut three ribs wide, squared on\r\nall sides, neck-bones out, breast flap off, foot cut off at the knee\r\njoint, butted just above blade-bone, and so trimmed as to expose the\r\nlean as much as possible. This is the leading “English” shoulder cut,\r\nand is made in averages from 10 to 20 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New Orleans Cut Shoulders._--These are made 1¹⁄₂ ribs wide, smooth and\r\nrounded on neck end, part of shoulder butt left on and neck-bone out.\r\nThey are cut principally in 12 to 14 pound averages, but are also made\r\nfrom 10 to 16 pounds, from shoulders that are too rough and fat to make\r\nNew York Cut or Picnic Shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boneless Rolled Picnics._--These are made from heavy picnics by\r\nlifting the skin, removing the surplus fat and the bone, pressing or\r\nrolling and tying with cord in the form of a roll in the same manner as\r\nrolled hams. They are also made from skinned picnics. Boneless rolled\r\nshoulders are made similarly from regular shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Butts and Plates.=--Butts are cut from the end or top of the shoulder\r\nand from the jowl. Plates are made from shoulder butts. The various\r\ngrades of these cuts are Boston Style, Milwaukee Style, Boneless,\r\nBuffalo Style, New York Style, Picnic, Dry-Salt and Square-Cut Butts;\r\nRegular Plates, Clear Plates and Back Plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Rough.\r\n  New York.\r\n  Skinned.\r\n  New Orleans.\r\n  Square.\r\n\r\nFIG. 124.--SHOULDERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Boston Butt.\r\n  Regular Plate.\r\n  Clear Plate.\r\n  Picnic Butt.\r\n\r\n  Boneless Butt.\r\n  New York Butt.\r\n\r\nFIG. 125.--BUTTS AND PLATES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Heavy.\r\n  Light.\r\n\r\nFIG. 126.--PICNICS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Spare Ribs (full sheet).\r\n  Spare Ribs (half sheet).\r\n\r\n  Dry salt butt (jowl).\r\n  Square cut butt.\r\n  Virginia style jowl.\r\n\r\nFIG. 127.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boston Style Butts._--These are the ends or top pieces cut from heavy\r\nshoulders when making picnics; the neck-bone, ribs and surplus fat\r\nbeing removed and the piece trimmed smooth. They include the end of\r\nthe shoulder blade. Average weights are 3 to 7 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Milwaukee Style Butts._--These are the same as Boston butts with the\r\nneck-bone and rib left on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boneless Butts or Lean Butts._--Also termed Cala Butts--These consist\r\nof the lean, boneless portion of Boston butts between the blade-bone\r\nand neck-bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buffalo Style Butts._--These are cut the same as boneless butts except\r\nthat the neck-bone is left in. They are used fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York Style Butts._--These are shoulder butts cut from picnics of\r\nthe thinner and lighter grades. They contain the neck-bone, fat and\r\nlean, and are mainly plain-pickled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Picnic Butts._--These are picnics from which the surplus fat and the\r\nskin are removed and the shank cut off close to the breast. They are\r\nnot trimmed as closely as regular picnics.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dry-Salt Butts._--These are made from the jowl (lower part of the neck\r\nand cheek) with the edges trimmed smooth and the piece pounded flat.\r\nThey weigh 3 to 5 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Square-Cut Butts._--These are also made from the jowl but are more\r\nclosely trimmed and squared. They average 2 to 4 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Regular Plates._--These are made from shoulder butts by removing\r\na boneless butt, thus making a fat piece with a facing of lean,\r\ncontaining the end of the blade-bone, and weighing 6 to 12 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Percentages of Yield.=--The variety of cuts into which a hog can be\r\ndivided are many and the tables following indicate the percentages of\r\nyield of the different cuts, based on the live weight of the hogs. The\r\npercentage of yield of lard includes both prime steam lard and leaf. It\r\nshould be understood that the total yield of the various cuts mentioned\r\nwill vary slightly in different markets, and in the same market at\r\ndifferent seasons of the year, according to the quality of the hog.\r\nThese variations will not be more than 2 per cent, probably, on the\r\ntotal yield.\r\n\r\nThe percentages here given are about an average, or possibly a little\r\nunder the average, and are based on hogs averaging from 240 to 275\r\npounds live weight. Extra short clears, extra short ribs, pork loins,\r\nfat backs and bellies are made out of mixed packing hogs, averaging\r\n220 to 300 pounds; at some seasons of the year averaging twenty-five to\r\nthirty pounds heavier.\r\n\r\nIn the percentages given it is estimated that the offal, such as hair,\r\nblood, fertilizer, casings, blade bones, etc., will cover the cost of\r\nkilling and cutting and in figuring these tests prices of green meat\r\nshould be used.\r\n\r\nCUT INTO EXTRA SHORT CLEARS WILL YIELD.\r\n\r\n                      Per\r\n                     cent.\r\n  Extra short clears  26\r\n  Loin                 9\r\n  Ham                 12¹⁄₂\r\n  Shoulder             9\r\n  Lard                13\r\n                      -----\r\n    Total             69¹⁄₂\r\n\r\nCUT INTO EXTRA SHORT RIBS WILL YIELD.\r\n\r\n                     Per\r\n                    cent.\r\n  Extra short ribs   26¹⁄₂\r\n  Loin                9\r\n  Ham                12¹⁄₂\r\n  Shoulder            9\r\n  Lard               13\r\n                     -----\r\n    Total            70\r\n\r\nCUT INTO PORK LOINS, BELLY AND SHORT FAT BACKS WILL YIELD.\r\n\r\n                     Per\r\n                    cent.\r\n  Loin                9\r\n  Belly              12\r\n  Backs              12\r\n  Shoulders           9\r\n  Hams               12¹⁄₂\r\n  Lard               13\r\n                     -----\r\n    Total            67¹⁄₂\r\n\r\nCUT INTO REGULAR SHORT RIBS AND ROUGH RIBS WILL YIELD.\r\n\r\n                     Per\r\n                    cent.\r\n  Ribs               37\r\n  Hams               12¹⁄₂\r\n  Shoulders           8\r\n  Lard               14¹⁄₂\r\n                     -----\r\n    Total            72\r\n\r\nCUT INTO ROUGH RIBS WILL YIELD.\r\n\r\n                     Per\r\n                    cent.\r\n  Rough ribs         37¹⁄₂\r\n  Hams               12¹⁄₂\r\n  Shoulders           8\r\n  Lard               14¹⁄₂\r\n                     -----\r\n    Total            72¹⁄₂\r\n\r\nCUT INTO REGULAR SHORT CLEARS WILL YIELD.\r\n\r\n                     Per\r\n                    cent.\r\n  Short clears       36\r\n  Hams               12¹⁄₂\r\n  Shoulders           8\r\n  Lard               14¹⁄₂\r\n                     -----\r\n    Total            71\r\n\r\nCUT INTO MESS PORK WILL YIELD.\r\n\r\n                     Per\r\n                    cent.\r\n  Mess pork          38\r\n  Hams               12¹⁄₂\r\n  Shoulders           8\r\n  Lard               14¹⁄₂\r\n                     -----\r\n    Total            73\r\n\r\nCUT INTO CUMBERLANDS WILL YIELD.\r\n\r\n120-lb.

At times the temperature in the foregoing is\r\nlowered to 34° F., but not frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vessels._--Formerly tierces were used almost entirely, but the trend\r\nhas been toward the use of vats or casks, uniform so far as possible\r\nin capacity, since it tends to better standardization. The vats can be\r\ntaken out for airing, washing and sunlight, which is a prime requisite.\r\n\r\nDimensions of a standard vat are about as follows: For 1,500 pounds\r\ncapacity, 42 inches high, 42 inches in diameter at the head, 48 inches\r\nin diameter at the bilge or center of vat. Thickness of stave one inch.\r\nHeads 1¹⁄₂ inch yellow pine; five galvanized iron hoops, two inches\r\nwide, made from No. 12 iron. Heads to be set flush with the chime, so\r\nthat the weight of the contents comes directly on the floor.\r\n\r\nVats of this kind seem to last indefinitely and are much cheaper to\r\nhandle than tierces, saving a large expense in coopering, and making\r\nit possible to use the space in the curing houses to better advantage.\r\nCold storage houses should be sufficiently high under the joists, so\r\nthese vats can be double-decked, one setting on top of the other,\r\nleaving about twenty inches of space. When handled in this manner the\r\nspace in the cellar is used to much better advantage with vats than\r\ntierces.\r\n\r\nInto a vat of the dimensions named, should be put 1,450 pounds of meat.\r\nIt will take practically sixty-eight gallons of pickle to fill the\r\nvat on a basis of 21¹⁄₃ pounds of meat to be cured, to each gallon of\r\npickle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hams and their Treatment.=--In the handling of product there is no\r\npart of the animal that requires as close and skillful attention as\r\ndoes the ham during the curing process. It is a thick, compact body of\r\nmeat and it takes considerable time to chill, it becomes tainted very\r\nsoon if not properly chilled. If the heat is removed, and the curing\r\nagent does not reach the interior promptly, decomposition sets in.\r\nAs before stated the first chilling of the carcass has everything to\r\ndo with the curing of this meat. If hams are properly chilled in the\r\ncooler, the balance of the process is comparatively simple. If they\r\nare only partially chilled from lack of proper attention or because\r\nof improper coolers, no curing agency will bring the hams out in a\r\nsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chilling._--In hog coolers properly operated, on light and medium\r\nweight hogs, where a ham temperature of 33° to 35° F. is obtained,\r\nhams can be packed directly into the vats or tierces. Heavy hams are\r\nsometimes placed in a holding room for twenty-four hours and kept at a\r\ntemperature of 33° F. to thoroughly chill. Some curers prefer to shelve\r\nall hams and to pump them before shelving.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meat Temperatures._--Each day’s cutting of hams should be tested\r\ninternally with a thermometer made especially for this purpose to\r\nfind the internal temperature. Light hams averaging from twelve to\r\nfourteen pounds should run from 33° to 34° F., heavy hams from 35° to\r\n37° F. Temperatures higher than those designated are not safe, from\r\na curing standpoint, and should be reduced to these points before\r\nthe hams can be safely cured. What is meant by “safely cured” is the\r\nminimum percentage of sour, which should run less than one ham in 1,000\r\npieces. If previous directions as to refrigeration, handling, etc., are\r\nfollowed closely this condition is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pumping._--The use of a pump in curing hams is a requisite to\r\nreasonably safe cure. A pump similar to that shown in Fig. 135 is\r\nused, the pickle being inserted around the joint by means of a hollow\r\nnickel needle. The needle is put in where the pickle is wanted, and\r\nwith one stroke of the pump the pickle is forced into the inside of the\r\nham. It is advisable to use a strong pickle, getting as much of the\r\ncurative properties as possible into the ham with a minimum amount of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--HAM PUMP.]\r\n\r\nThe pump illustrated is designed so that a measured quantity must be\r\nthrown per stroke. It was formerly thought unwise to pump the selected\r\nor fancy hams, but if the work be carefully done, whatever damage might\r\noccur, is justified by the general results. In pumping hams care should\r\nbe used not to pump them heavy enough to burst the tissues, and to\r\nget as much as possible of the ingredient pumped in around the stifle\r\njoint, as this is the joint where decomposition sets in.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pumping Pickle._--Ham pumping pickle is usually quite a strong\r\nsolution. A good recipe is one gallon of 100° brine, to which is added\r\nfifteen ounces of saltpetre (potassium nitrate) and fifteen ounces\r\nsugar; in the same proportion for larger quantities.\r\n\r\nThe sugar has the effect of toning down the brash salt effect in the\r\nmeat, giving it a more palatable flavor, also to a certain extent it\r\naids in curing. The saltpetre aids in curing the meat, and gives it\r\na bright, attractive color. Meat which is cured without the use of\r\nsaltpetre has a dead appearance, and is very unattractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pumping Quantities._--Fancy hams should be pumped with one stick of\r\nthe needle pushed in from the shank end, delivering along the bone at\r\nthe stifle joint, using two strokes of the pump.\r\n\r\nRegular hams should be pumped as above with an additional stick in the\r\nstifle and one under the aitch bone, one in the butt of the ham, two\r\nstrokes per stick. Heavy hams, eighteen to twenty pounds, use three\r\nstrokes for each stick. Picnics or Californias should be pumped with\r\none stroke. Stick in shank, in blood vessel over blade-bone and under\r\nblade-bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ham Curing Pickle._--Ham curing pickle varies among different curing\r\nauthorities. The use of freezers for storing fully cured meats is now\r\nso general that the curing pickle, even for fancy hams, can be made\r\nsomewhat stronger with no serious saltiness resulting, provided the ham\r\nis removed at about the cured age. Fancy hams, owing to the selection\r\nand usually being of lighter weight are put in a medium pickle, with a\r\npickle of 78-degree density. To one-thousand gallons of 78-degree brine\r\nadd 250 pounds of sugar and 50 pounds of saltpetre, using 5 gallons\r\nof solution per 100 pounds net weight of meat. The 78-degree pickle\r\nreferred to being the density of salt solution measured by a Salometer\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nFor standard hams use 78-degree pickle with 200 pounds of sugar and 65\r\npounds of saltpetre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pickle Making._--For sake of uniformity it is best to have as large\r\nvessels as possible for making pickle solutions, so as to minimize\r\nthe likelihood of error; storage vats should be provided, with coils,\r\nthrough which refrigerated brine should be circulated for the purpose\r\nof chilling the pickle to a uniform temperature, usually 35° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wilder Hams.=--A ham cure method advocated by Mr. Wilder was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory method of handling hams, before beginning to pickle\r\nis (providing the hogs have been properly chilled in the cooler for\r\nfrom sixty to seventy-two hours), as soon as they are inspected and\r\ngraded, to spread them on the floor, piling them up carefully, shank\r\ndown, about 2¹⁄₂ to 3 feet high, salt each ham slightly with fine salt,\r\nand let them lie packed over night in the cooler at a temperature of\r\nfrom 36° to 38° F. The next day they are put into process of curing.\r\nWhen hogs are properly chilled in a dry cooler, they come out more or\r\nless dried, and the surface of the ham, as well as the rind, is not\r\nsufficiently porous and open to absorb the pickle promptly, the meat\r\nbeing cooler than the curing room. When, however, it comes in contact\r\nwith the fine salt, this causes moisture to form on the meat, which\r\nopens up the pores, in which condition the ham readily absorbs the\r\npickle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formula for Wilder Ham Pickle._--Inasmuch as the hams have been salted\r\non the floor, the pickle should carry correspondingly less salt in\r\ncuring. Otherwise the meat will be too salty. A 75-degree plain pickle\r\nis as strong as should be used for hams thus handled.\r\n\r\nTo a tank holding 1,680 gallons, filled with 75-degree pickle, there\r\nshould be added:\r\n\r\n  475 pounds granulated sugar.\r\n   90 pounds saltpetre.\r\n\r\nThis makes a very safe and effective cure. The hams when being put down\r\nshould be pumped as follows:\r\n\r\n  Five stitch in the shank;\r\n  One on the shank joint;\r\n  One on the aitch bone;\r\n  One on top of the shank;\r\n  Two in the body;\r\n\r\nmaking a total of ten stitches per ham. The meat should be overhauled\r\nfrom one vat to another at the end of five days, second overhauling ten\r\ndays later, pumping at that time with three stitches:\r\n\r\n  One in the shank;\r\n  One in the body;\r\n  One in the aitch bone.\r\n\r\nIt adds greatly to the certainty of the cure of meats to be thus pumped.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wilder Sirup Curing._--The best flavored meats are produced with\r\nsirup, instead of sugar, but meats handled in this way have not the\r\nkeeping qualities that meats have when cured with a granulated or light\r\nsugar. The sirup also has a tendency to discolor the meat, making it\r\nlook less attractive, and this, coupled with its tendency to cause\r\nfermentation, has made the curing of meat with sirup, in large concerns\r\nat least, undesirable.\r\n\r\nA formula for the use of sirup in a 1,500-gallon vat would be as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  88 gallons sugarhouse sirup.\r\n  75 pounds saltpetre.\r\n\r\nThis will make a dark-colored pickle. Hams turned out in this manner\r\nare of a very delicate flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shoulder Meats Pickle.=--Shoulder meats are quite difficult to cure,\r\nprobably owing to the blood content, etc. The chilling is quite as\r\nessential as for ham, and it is customary to use a stronger pickle,\r\nas well as to pump the meat somewhat heavily. The pickle for shoulder\r\nmeats is to add to 1,000 gallons of 85-degree brine, 150 pounds of\r\nsugar and 65 pounds of saltpetre.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bellies.=--Bellies cured in vats are a comparatively easily cured\r\nproduct. The process being to simply put the requisite quantity of meat\r\nin the cask and add the pickle. S. P. Bellies can be nicely cured in a\r\npickle of 70-degree strength with 150 pounds of sugar and 65 pounds of\r\nsaltpetre per 1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Overhauling Meats.=--Overhauling is the term used in cellars to\r\ndescribe the process of transferring meat from one cask to another\r\nto insure its being shifted so that all parts of the meat may be\r\nequally exposed to the curing solution. It is a laborious task, but\r\na necessity, and perhaps one of the first processes to be neglected\r\nin case of labor shortage. In most establishments its importance is\r\nrecognized to be of such magnitude that a record is kept of each cask\r\nto see that the transaction is carried out. The following table gives\r\nthe periods at which the meats should be changed:\r\n\r\n  Fancy hams    5, 15 and 30 days.\r\n  Regular hams  5, 20 and 40 days.\r\n  Picnics           5 and 20 days.\r\n  Bellies           4 and 15 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fancy Bacon.=--This particular part of the animal is cured either in\r\ndry salt or sweet pickle, according to the requirements of the trade\r\nand the grade or quality of the meat. The highest class bacon used\r\nin this country is generally “dry salt,” being specially handled and\r\nprepared to make the most attractive appearance. A much sought for\r\npoint in bacon is to so prepare it that when fried it is of a light\r\ncolor. The only way to obtain this color is to use less sugar in\r\ncuring, as it causes discoloration in cooking; but at the same time it\r\ngreatly adds to the flavor, hence curing by the dry salt method adds\r\nto the looks. When it is cured in this way it should be dry packed in\r\nair-tight boxes lined with galvanized iron, or other material, the meat\r\nbeing put down with a fine salt combination, thoroughly mixed per 100\r\npounds of meat as follows:\r\n\r\n  2.75 pounds English salt.\r\n  1.25 pounds sugar.\r\n  3    ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nThe meat should be held in this cure about twenty days.\r\n\r\nThe meats are packed with the rind down uniformly, the salt being\r\nspread between the layers, the top layer being put on with the rind up\r\nand the box closed, keeping the air from it as much as possible; meat\r\nmust not be overhauled. It should be fully cured in twenty-five days.\r\nMeat handled in this manner, as stated before, when fried cooks white;\r\nit also has a very bright appearance when smoked. This is a delicate\r\ncure and must be handled accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shipping Ages.=--The table on next page gives what is considered the\r\nage, in days, at which different kinds and weights of sweet pickled\r\nhams and sides are cured sufficiently to smoke; also at which different\r\nkinds of barrel pork are cured sufficiently to be sold; also the cuts\r\nwhich should and should not be pumped.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Second Pickle.=--A wasteful practice in packing houses, is to throw\r\naway pickle as soon as the meat is cured. A pickle which will show\r\n78-degree strength, to which has been added five to seven degrees\r\nof sugar, saltpetre, etc., making it 83 to 85-degree when used, if\r\ntested after meats have been cured, will show a strength of from 52\r\nto 58-degrees, the meat having absorbed the balance of the curative\r\ningredients. The remaining ingredients in this pickle are good when\r\npurified--salt and sugar being the same under all conditions--hence\r\nwhen meats are fully cured the pickle should be pumped into a vat, in\r\nthe bottom and sides of which are galvanized iron coils. Steam should\r\nthen be turned on these coils heating the pickle by the radiation from\r\nthe pipe.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING AGES.--TIME REQUIRED FOR CURING.\r\n\r\n  ========================+============+=======+=======+======\r\n                          | Average wt.|Days to|Days to|\r\n          Product         |    lbs.    | smoke | ship  |Pumped\r\n  ------------------------+------------+-------+-------+------\r\n  S.

They are distinct from English meats, described\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short Ribs._--This is a regular Board-of-Trade cut and is quoted on\r\nthe market daily. The price of same is used as a basis of value for\r\nother cuts of dry salt meats. Short ribs are made from the sides of the\r\nhog between the ham and shoulder, having the loin and ribs in, and the\r\nbackbone removed. Graded usually as follows:\r\n\r\n  40 to 45 lbs. average.\r\n  45 to 50 lbs. average.\r\n  50 to 55 lbs. average.\r\n  55 to 60 lbs. average.\r\n  60 to 65 lbs. average.\r\n\r\nPrices vary according to weight. This cut is known as “regular short\r\nribs” and is delivered on Board-of-Trade transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hard Ribs._--These are the same as regulars, except that the backbone\r\nis removed. This cut cannot be delivered on the Board-of-Trade without\r\nremoving of the backbone. This is a cut sold largely in the south and\r\nis made out of the heaviest, roughest hogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short Clears._--These are the same as short ribs, but have the spare\r\nribs and backbone removed. They are cut square at each end and graded\r\nas to average weight, same as short ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short Clear Backs._--These are made from the backs of hogs with the\r\nloin left in, the ribs and backbone removed. This cut is also known as\r\n“lean backs” and “loin backs.” Values vary according to average weight\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  14 to 16 lbs. average.\r\n  18 to 20 lbs. average.\r\n  20 to 25 lbs. average.\r\n  25 to 30 lbs. average.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extra Short Clears._--These are made from sides of hogs between the\r\nham and shoulders with the rib and loin taken out. They are sold on an\r\naverage from--\r\n\r\n  35 to 40 lbs. average.\r\n  40 to 45 lbs. average.\r\n  45 to 50 lbs. average.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extra Short Ribs._--These are the same cut as extra short clears, in\r\nevery respect, except that the spare ribs are left in the belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short Fat Backs._--These are made from back pork of prime hogs, being\r\nfree from lean and bone, properly squared on the edges. They are\r\ngenerally quoted as follows:\r\n\r\n  10 to 12 lbs. average.\r\n  14 to 16 lbs. average.\r\n  18 to 20 lbs. average.\r\n  20 to 25 lbs. average.\r\n  25 to 30 lbs. average.\r\n  30 to 35 lbs. average.\r\n  35 to 40 lbs. average.\r\n\r\nThese cuts may be used for the domestic trade and are usually under\r\ntwenty-five pounds average in weight. The heavier backs are, however,\r\nin general practice used mainly for the export trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Long Clears._--These are made from the sides, hams being cut off,\r\nbackbone and ribs removed, shoulder blade taken out, the leg cut off\r\nclose to the brisket; being the entire side of the hog, with the ham\r\nand the bones removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extra Long Clears._--These are trimmed the same as long clears, except\r\nthat the loin is cut out.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bellies._--These are cut with the sides squared and well trimmed on\r\nall edges. They are cured in sweet pickle, plain pickle, or dry salt\r\nand graded generally, as follows:\r\n\r\n  10 to 12 lbs. average.\r\n  14 to 16 lbs. average.\r\n  18 to 20 lbs. average.\r\n  20 to 25 lbs. average.\r\n  25 to 30 lbs. average.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Regular Plates._--These are made from the end of the shoulder when\r\nthis is cut into California hams, and have half of the blade bone with\r\na facing of lean left on. The usual weight averages six to eight pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clear Plates._--These are the same as regulars except blade bones are\r\nnever trimmed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dry Salt Butts._--This is a cut made from the fat cheek or jowl,\r\ntrimmed to average from three to four pounds each and is a uniform cut\r\nof the hog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--LONG CLEAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Curing Dry Salt Meats.=--Dry salt meats, as the name implies, are\r\nsupposedly salted dry and piled to cure. Being mostly fat, which\r\ncontains but little moisture, and absorbs but little salt, the fat\r\nportion, or cuts consisting principally of fat are easy to cure. Those\r\ncuts which contain lean parts, bone or blood vessels need the most\r\ncareful attention. As a result all cuts of the latter type are pumped\r\nby use of hollow needles through which brine solution is forced,\r\nvarying with the weight and with the cut. A hard rib is pumped more\r\nthan a short rib.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dipping._--The meats are usually passed through a dipping tub so as\r\nto make the edges moist and cover the entire surface with salt; damp\r\nsalt being caused to adhere to the edges.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt to be Used._--The salt usually used is known as No. 1 Fine or\r\nCommon salt, evaporated, rather than mined or ground salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--EXTRA LONG CLEAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pumping._--A standard pumping schedule, using an open point needle and\r\ncommon type dry salt pump, would be as follows:\r\n\r\nSTANDARD PUMPING SCHEDULE.\r\n\r\n                             Strokes\r\n                               per\r\n      Products        Points  Point\r\n  Dry salt shoulders     4      2\r\n  Plates                 2      2\r\n  Short ribs             7      1\r\n  Short clears           7      1\r\n  Rib bellies            4      4\r\n  Clear bellies          4      1\r\n  Hard ribs             10      1\r\n\r\nDry salt pumping pickle should be 100° brine using one pound of\r\nsaltpetre per gallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Overhauling and Piling._--The sides are always piled hollow side up\r\nso that pickle made by solution of moisture purging from the meat is\r\ncontained on the meats. The piles are overhauled at regular intervals\r\nso as to insure the meats being subjected to salt at all points.\r\nOverhauling should be made: first, eight to twelve days; second,\r\neighteen to twenty-five days; third, forty-five to fifty-five days.\r\n\r\nGreen meats should not be piled to exceed three and one-half feet in\r\nheight until the third overhauling when they can be stacked higher to\r\nmake room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--JOWL (DRY SALT BUTTS.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Smoking Dry Salt Meats.=--The following table shows the age, in days,\r\nat which dry salt meat should be cured in order to smoke safely; also\r\nat which to ship safely; also the cuts that should and should not be\r\npumped:\r\n\r\nTIME REQUIRED FOR CURING.\r\n\r\n  =====================+==============+=======+=======+======\r\n                       |  Average wt. |Days to|Days to|\r\n       Product         |     lbs.     | smoke | ship  |Pumped\r\n  ---------------------+--------------+-------+-------+------\r\n  Extra short clears   |      ...     |   25  |   15  |  Yes\r\n  Short clears         |45-55         |   50  |   40  |  Yes\r\n  Extra short ribs     |      ...     |   25  |   20  |  Yes\r\n  Short ribs           |45-50         |   55  |   55  |  Yes\r\n  Short ribs           |50-80         |   75  |   70  |  Yes\r\n  Bellies              |15-17         |   25  |   25  |  Yes\r\n  Bellies              |18-21         |   30  |   27  |  Yes\r\n  Bellies              |18-22 and over|   35  |   32  |  Yes\r\n  Bellies fancy        | 4- 6         |   20  |   20  |   No\r\n  English bellies      |      ...     |   15  |   20  |   No\r\n  Shoulders            |      ...     |   30  |   30  |  Yes\r\n  Shoulders English    |      ...     |   25  |   30  |  Yes\r\n  Cumberlands          |      ...     |   20  |   30  |  Yes\r\n  Dublins              |      ...     |   20  |   20  |  Yes\r\n  Long cut hams        |      ...     |   20  |   25  |  Yes\r\n  Fat backs            |      ...     |   20  |   25  |   No\r\n  Jowl butts--         |              |       |       |\r\n    10 days in brine}  |      ...     |   20  |   20  |   No\r\n    10 days in salt }  |      ...     |       |       |\r\n  Backs                |      ...     |   25  |   25  |  Yes\r\n  Plates               |      ...     |   10  |   10  |   No\r\n  ---------------------+--------------+-------+-------+------\r\n\r\nMeats put into a smoke house before they are sufficiently cured develop\r\na condition known to the trade as “puffy,” which means that the meats\r\nbeing insufficiently cured when submitted to the heat of the smoke\r\nhouse, decompose and a gas forms which produces the condition referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIn cold weather and by arrangement, meats are frequently shipped at\r\nyounger ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Barreled Pork.=--Being usually cut and handled by the Cellar\r\nDepartment, barreled pork is consequently described therewith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mess Pork._--Regular Mess Pork is “made from sides of well fatted\r\nhogs, split through or one side of the back-bone and equal proportions\r\non both sides, cut into strips of reasonably uniform width, properly\r\nflanked and not back stripped.” The regular proportion of flank and\r\nshoulder cuts must be included. The strips average about six inches\r\nin width, and not over sixteen pieces may be packed in a barrel for\r\nregular delivery. Mess Pork is made from rough and heavy packing hogs\r\nand occasionally from heavy loin hogs. Mess pork packed between October\r\n1 of one year and September 30 of the succeeding year is “new pork”\r\nuntil January 1 of the following year, and is thereafter termed “old\r\npork.” Mess Pork made during December, January and February must have\r\nbeen packed at least ten days before delivery, and that delivered\r\nduring the period from March to November, inclusive, must have been\r\npacked at least thirty days before delivery to grade regular.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For Mess Pork._--The hog is split through the center of the back-bone,\r\nafter the shoulders and hams are removed, about six inches wide, and\r\nare packed 190 pounds to the barrel, but it is supposed to weigh 200\r\npounds when sold; the gain of pickle making up the difference in\r\nweight. When it is six months old, it will, weigh more than 200 pounds,\r\nand if repacked will make 104 to 105 barrels per 100 barrels when\r\npacked, and should be repacked at 200 pounds. When a number of pieces\r\nis not specified, mess pork is packed from eleven to fifteen pieces per\r\nbarrel.\r\n\r\nPrime Mess Pork is made from the shoulder and side, containing the\r\nback-bone and ribs, cut into square pieces of about four pounds each.\r\nThe shank is cut off close to the breast. In making this cut, the side\r\nis split lengthwise, the back cut into about six pieces and the belly\r\ninto four. It is made from light packing hogs.\r\n\r\nExtra clear pork is “made from the sides of extra heavy, well-fatted\r\nhogs, the back-bone and ribs to be taken out, (the same as short clear\r\nsides) the number of pieces in each barrel not to exceed fourteen, and\r\nin all other respects to be cut, selected and packed in the same manner\r\nas mess pork.”\r\n\r\nClear pork is “made from the sides of extra heavy, well-fatted hogs,\r\nthe back-bone and half the ribs next the back-bone to be taken out,\r\nthe number of pieces in each barrel not to exceed fourteen, and in all\r\nother respects to be cut, selected and packed in the same manner as\r\nmess pork.”\r\n\r\nLoin clear pork is “made from the sides of medium-weight packing hogs,\r\nthe loin, back-bone and back ribs being removed and belly ribs left\r\nin.” It consists of extra short ribs cut into strips, and is also known\r\nas long-cut clear pork. The pieces average five inches in width.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Belly Pork._--Regular belly pork consists of heavy, fat rib bellies\r\ncut into five-inch widths and packed as plain-pickled pork in barrels\r\nof fifty to sixty pieces. This pork is made from the same grade of\r\nbellies as dry-salt rib bellies.\r\n\r\nBrisket pork rib is made by cutting a five-inch strip from the brisket\r\nend of heavy rib bellies (fourteen to twenty pounds average) and\r\npacking like other barreled pork. The pieces average about four pounds\r\neach. This cut is made only when it is desired to reduce the weight of\r\nheavy bellies. Clear brisket pork is made in the same manner as the\r\nabove except the pieces are cut from clear bellies. Fancy clear pork\r\nis a strip cut from the brisket end of fancy breakfast bacon bellies,\r\naveraging one to one and one-half pounds per piece.\r\n\r\nLean belly pork consists of lean clear bellies, thirteen to fifteen\r\npounds average, cut into three pieces each and barreled in plain pickle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Back Pork._--Regular back pork (short cut mess, or family back pork)\r\nis “made from the backs of well-fatted hogs, after bellies have been\r\ntaken off, cut into pieces of about six pounds each, and in all other\r\nrespects to be cut, selected and packed in the same manner as mess\r\npork.” This cut contains the loin, back-bone and back ribs, with\r\ntenderloin out, and the pieces are cut six inches wide, averaging four\r\nto six pounds.\r\n\r\nClear back pork is “made from the backs of heavy, well-fatted hogs,\r\nafter bellies have been taken off, and back-bone and ribs taken out,\r\ncut into pieces of about six pounds each, and in all other respects to\r\nbe packed in the same manner as mess pork.” In other words, it consists\r\nof short clear backs cut into strips about six inches wide, and is the\r\nsame as regular back pork with the rib removed. It is sometimes called\r\nloin clear pork. The pieces average two to seven pounds.\r\n\r\nFat back pork or short cut clear pork is made from short fat backs by\r\ncutting them into five-inch strips. The pieces average from two to\r\nseven pounds and are packed like mess pork.\r\n\r\nHam butt pork (loin end or rump pork) consists of triangular pieces cut\r\nfrom the ham end of short clear backs or sides and includes a portion\r\nof the tail-bone. It is made when cutting short-cut harps and “English”\r\nsides, or when it is desired to reduce the weight of heavy sides or\r\nbacks. It is packed in barrels, the pieces averaging three to four\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shoulder Pork._--Consists of the following products made from\r\nshoulders and butts:\r\n\r\nExtra prime pork is “made from heavy untrimmed shoulders cut into three\r\npieces, the leg to be cut off close to the breast, and in all other\r\nrespects to be cut, selected and packed in the same manner as mess\r\npork.” The pieces average about four pounds. This and the preceding cut\r\nare not used as extensively as formerly.\r\n\r\nBoston style butt pork is made from Boston style butts averaging four\r\nto seven pounds, packed in plain pickle.\r\n\r\nBean pork or clear butt pork is made from the jowl or fat cheek of the\r\nhog, cut square, trimmed smooth and averaging three to four pounds,\r\npacked in plain pickle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spareribs._--Consist of the ribs trimmed from the carcass or side with\r\nas little lean as possible. They are termed “full-sheet,” “half-sheet”\r\nand “back-bone” spareribs according as they are cut from full sides,\r\nbellies or backs respectively. They are essentially a fresh pork\r\nproduct and are sold in retail markets especially in fall and winter,\r\nfor which purpose “half-sheet” ribs are principally used. They are\r\npacked in limited amounts in sweet pickle at times when the demand for\r\nfresh spareribs is dull; dry-salt spareribs are taken from dry-salt\r\nsides and bellies when making them into clear cuts after curing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Curing Barrel Pork.=--Barreled or plain-pickled pork is packed in\r\nplain salt brine in tight barrels (eighteen feet × twenty inches) at\r\n200 pounds net weight of cured pork per barrel (355 pounds gross). The\r\nstrength of brine is varied somewhat according to the cuts of pork\r\nand their destination. The regulation of the Chicago Board of Trade\r\ngoverning standard barreled pork (except prime mess) is as follows:\r\n“Between October 1, and the last day of February, inclusive, 190 lbs.,\r\nand between March 1st and September 30th, inclusive, 193 lbs., of green\r\nmeat--shall be packed in each barrel, with not less than forty pounds\r\nof coarse salt and barrel filled with brine of full strength; or forty\r\npounds of coarse salt and in addition thereto fifteen pounds of salt\r\nand barrel filled with cold water.” Standard prime mess pork is packed\r\ntwenty pounds salt and twelve ounces of saltpetre per barrel, otherwise\r\nas above.\r\n\r\n\r\n=English Meats.=--There is, at times, a demand in England for American\r\npork products, and the English cuts, as well as their methods of\r\ncuring in many cases, vary from the American methods on account of\r\nthe natural fat hardness due to feeding and breeding, and to the fact\r\nthat the English market is supplied chiefly from Denmark, Ireland and\r\nHolland, except as to the pigs raised locally. The result is that the\r\ncure of English meats is quite mild owing to non-exposure and prompt\r\nconsumption. These conditions make it requisite that much care be taken\r\nin the production of meats shipped England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pumping._--It is usual to pump English meats with a pumping pickle of\r\nsaturated brine, containing three ounces of saltpetre to the gallon. In\r\npumping Cumberlands (Fig. 139) and shoulders, pump into the blood vein\r\nand under the blade, using one and one-half to two ounces of pickle in\r\neach place, and exercising care to lodge the pickle near the bone and\r\naway from the fat on the side of the meat.\r\n\r\nIn pumping long cut hams, use ham pumping pickle and pump in the same\r\nmanner as described for fancy hams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salting._--Imported English salt is invariably used. There are a\r\nnumber of standard brands, but the endeavor is to obtain a salt free\r\nfrom lime or magnesia compounds. The quantity should be exact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--CUMBERLAND CUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.--LONG CUT HAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--MANCHESTER HAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--STAFFORDSHIRE HAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--YORKSHIRE SIDE.]\r\n\r\nOn meats not overhauled not less than four and one-half nor more than\r\nfive and one-half pounds of salt to the one-hundred pounds on all cuts\r\nexcepting long cut hams, should be used. On the latter from five to six\r\npounds of salt per one-hundred pounds of meat should be applied. In the\r\nsummer months the maximum amounts heretofore described should be used.\r\n\r\nOn meats overhauled used three to three and one-half pounds of salt per\r\none-hundred pounds when putting down, and three pounds per one-hundred\r\npounds when overhauling. Rub salt in well under the sides of shanks of\r\nshoulders, and use plenty on the top of shanks of both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--STAFFORDSHIRE SIDE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--DUBLIN CUT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rubbing Side and Pockets._--In salting sides, salt the heaviest on the\r\nshoulder and along the loin, rubbing the edges of all cuts carefully,\r\nseeing that the salt adheres to all parts of the meat before it is\r\npiled, for if there are places where there is no salt on the meat, it\r\nwill discolor and eventually become slippery and in bad condition.\r\n\r\nIn stuffing the pockets of long clears and long ribs, do not use more\r\nthan one and one-half times the amount of salt on the same area of\r\nshoulder or loin. Too much salt used in the pockets of the sides gives\r\nthe meat a burned salty appearance and condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--ANTWERP BACK CUT.]\r\n\r\nIn rubbing the salt into the pockets be careful to put the salt into\r\nevery part, otherwise meat will spoil in places missed.\r\n\r\nBellies require less salt, the fixed rule being 42%. They are not\r\nusually overhauled but are frozen at cure, if shipping is deferred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--SQUARE EXPORT SHORT RIB.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Color._--A great deal depends upon the color of English meats. The\r\ntrade demands a bright, attractive appearance in same and considerable\r\nsaltpetre is necessary. Four ounces of saltpetre to the 100 pounds of\r\nmeat on cuts weighing from three to five pieces per 100 pounds, to as\r\nhigh as six ounces per 100 pounds on smaller cuts, should be used. The\r\nsalt and saltpetre should be thoroughly mixed before applying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.--WILTSHIRE SIDE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Piling._--Use extra care to pile meats closely and exclude the air,\r\nfor they will not develop a desirable color when they are exposed to\r\nthe air. After the meats are all piled evenly, the edges should be gone\r\nover, and any exposed parts covered with a fine sprinkling of salt.\r\n\r\nSides are piled so as to make a cup of the hollow portion with a\r\ntendency for the pickle to drain slightly toward the back. Hams are\r\npiled shank down on an angle of about 45°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--SQUARE SHORT CLEAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Overhauling._--English middles weighing from twenty-three to thirty\r\npounds average, and long cut hams from twelve to fourteen pounds\r\nand heavier, should be overhauled at from eight to twelve days old,\r\nsalting them as before described. Do not overhaul English meats unless\r\nnecessary in order to hold them after they are cured.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING AGE.\r\n\r\n  =====================+========+==========+==========\r\n                       |        |Oct. 15 to|  March 1\r\n                       |Average | March 1  |to Oct. 15\r\n        Product        |wt. lbs.|   Days   |   Days\r\n  ---------------------+--------+----------+----------\r\n  Bellies              |  ...   | 15 to 25 | 15 to 25\r\n  Boneless backs       |  ...   | 15 to 25 | 15 to 25\r\n  Cumberlands          | 20-24  | 20 to 25 | 20 to 25\r\n  Cumberlands          | 24-30  | 20 to 25 | 25 to 30\r\n  Cumberlands          | 30-40  | 25 to 30 | 25 to 30\r\n  Long clears          |under 30| 20 to 25 | 20 to 25\r\n  Long clears          |over  30| 20 to 25 | 25 to 30\r\n  Dublins and long ribs|  ...   | 20 to 25 | 20 to 25\r\n  Long cut hams        | 10-14  | 20 to 25 | 20 to 25\r\n  Long cut hams        | 14-18  | 25 to 30 | 25 to 30\r\n  ---------------------+--------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shipping Ages._--The table on the preceding page shows the ages at\r\nwhich English meats can be safely shipped during seasons from October\r\n15 to March 1, and from March 1 to October 15.\r\n\r\nThese ages for shipping should be followed closely, but when necessary\r\nthe following exception may be made without detriment.\r\n\r\nFrom October 15 to March 1, shortest shipping age may be reduced five\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boxing Meats._--Meats to be packed in borax, cured as above, should be\r\nput in a plain cold pickle 100-degree strong, then scraped on the skin\r\nside and wiped with cloths wrung out of hot water. If the meats are old\r\nand have a slippery appearance, they should be scrubbed with a brush\r\nin warm pickle and wiped afterwards. They should then be rubbed in\r\nborax with the rind placed upon a grating and the surplus borax brushed\r\noff the skin side of the meat, using a fine brush for so doing. It is\r\ncustomary to use from five and one-half to six and one-half pounds of\r\nborax per 300 pounds of meat. Meats to be packed in salt should not be\r\nwashed. The skin and edges of the meat should be thoroughly scraped\r\nand then rubbed in fine salt before being put in the boxes. Meats are\r\nnailed under heavy pressure so as to exclude all the air possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wiltshires._--Singed Wiltshires, a cut which was revived during the\r\n“Great War,” are made from hogs suitable for Cumberlands. Weights vary\r\nby averages. The hogs are singed during slaughter, cured in plain\r\npickle, and shipped on ten days’ pickling, packed in dry salt.\r\n\r\nLONG CUT HAMS AND CUMBERLAND TESTS.\r\n\r\n  =======+===================+========+========+==================+=====\r\n  Av. wt.|                   |        |        |                  |\r\n   live  |  Average          |        |Per cent|                  |Per\r\n   hogs, |   weight          |Per cent|Cumber- |     Per cent     |cent\r\n   lbs.  |    cuts, lbs.     |  hams  | lands  |  miscellaneous   |total\r\n  -------+-------------------+--------+--------+------------------+-----\r\n         |                   |        |        |{P.

It shows the percentage of yields\r\nof different weight hogs made into long cut hams and Cumberlands, also\r\naverage weights.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pig Feet.=--Usually only the front foot is used as it is a better\r\nshaped foot to prepare than the hind foot. The hind feet are more or\r\nless disfigured and out of condition by having the gam strings opened\r\nin order to hang the hog on the sticks. The hind foot being used\r\nlargely for making a low grade of glue. It can, however, be used in\r\nboneless pig’s feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation._--The feet are scalded, after which the hoofs are removed\r\nand the feet are shaved and cleaned, put into a plain salt pickle,\r\n90-degree strong by salometer test, and to this pickle should be added\r\nsix ounces of saltpetre to each 100 pounds of feet. The feet should be\r\nleft in this curing pickle for from six to eight days, or until they\r\nshow a bright red appearance when cooked. If this red appearance does\r\nnot extend clear through the feet after being cooked, it shows that\r\nthey are not fully cured. They should not be left in the pickle longer\r\nthan necessary to fully cure them for if heavily salted it has the\r\neffect of making them break in the cooking water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cooking._--After properly cured in the salt pickle the feet should be\r\ncooked in a wooden vat (an iron vat discoloring them) provided with a\r\nfalse bottom about six inches above the bottom, so that the direct heat\r\nfrom the steam pipe does not come in contact with the feet. The water\r\nshould be brought to a temperature of 200° to 206° F. and held at this\r\ntemperature until the feet are sufficiently cooked. The water should\r\nnever be brought to the boiling point, as the feet will become badly\r\nbroken, which greatly injures their appearance.\r\n\r\nAfter the feet are sufficiently cooked and thoroughly chilled in cold\r\nwater, they should be put into a white wine vinegar pickle 45-degree\r\nstrong, it being preferable to pack feet which are to be used at once\r\nin open vats in a refrigerated room held at a temperature of 38° to\r\n40° F. Where feet are to be held for some months before using it is\r\nadvisable to put them into barrels or tierces after filling the tierces\r\nwith vinegar of 45-degree strength. The packages should be stored in a\r\ntemperature 40° F. When held this way it will be found that the feet\r\nhave absorbed a great deal of the vinegar and a very marked increase\r\nin weight is obtained. There should be a gain of from 10 to 15 per cent\r\nin weight at the end of three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tests._--Prepared pig’s feet at certain seasons of the year are\r\ndifficult of sale and there are times when it pays better to tank them\r\nor use them for glue purposes. The following tests on rough uncleaned\r\nfore and hind feet will show the yield when tanked. Percentages in\r\ntests are correct. The prices are those ruling at the time tests were\r\nmade:\r\n\r\nTEST ON TANKED PIGS FEET.\r\n\r\n    Total weight of front feet tanked 1,070 pounds cooked in tank five\r\n  hours at forty pounds pressure:\r\n\r\n  Sixty pounds hock meat, 5.61 per cent, at 3c per pound         $ 1.80\r\n  Prime steam lard, 138 pounds, 12.90 per cent, at $9.35 per\r\n  cwt.                                                            12.90\r\n  Tankage (dry basis), 125 pounds, 11.68 per cent, at $17.50\r\n  per ton                                                          1.09\r\n                                                                 ------\r\n    Total                                                        $15.79\r\n  Gross value, $1.47 per cwt.\r\n\r\n    Weight hind feet to tank, 996 pounds, cooked in test tank\r\n  five hours, with forty pounds pressure:\r\n\r\n  Prime steam lard, 163 pounds, 16.37 per cent, at $9.35\r\n  per cwt.                                                       $15.24\r\n  Tankage (dry basis), 13.76 per cent, at $17.50 per ton           1.19\r\n                                                                 ------\r\n    Total                                                        $16.43\r\n  Gross value, $1.62 per cwt.\r\n\r\nThe following tests show costs, in detail, of pig’s feet put up in\r\ndifferent sized packages, costs being figured at the regular Chicago\r\nmarket prices at the time these tests were made:\r\n\r\nTEST ON 483 PIECES OR 500 POUNDS PIGS FORE FEET.\r\n\r\n    _Debit:_\r\n  Cost of 500 pounds pigs fore feet at 1¹⁄₈c per pound        $5.63\r\n  Shaving, hand and machine, 32c per 100 pieces                1.55\r\n  Pulling toes, 5c per 100 pieces                               .24\r\n  Counting, pickling and cooking                                .20\r\n  Splitting, 2c per 100 pounds                                  .10\r\n  Miscellaneous labor                                           .10\r\n  Fifty-five pounds salt at ¹⁄₄c per pound                      .14\r\n  Two pounds saltpetre at 5c per pound                          .10\r\n  Administrative expense at 47c per 100 pounds on 300 pounds\r\n  produced                                                     1.41\r\n                                                              -----\r\n    Total                                                     $9.47\r\n\r\n    _Credit:_\r\n  Pigs feet oil, 18 pounds at $5.60 per cwt.                  $1.00\r\n  Pigs feet bones, 58 pounds at ³⁄₄c per pound                  .43\r\n  Pigs feet trimmings, 13 pounds at 1¹⁄₄c per pound             .13\r\n                                                             ------\r\n    Total                                                     $1.56\r\n    Total net cost of 300 pounds of prepared feet              7.91\r\n\r\n  Cost per pound, including administrative expense, $0.026.\r\n\r\n  Green weight, 500 pounds; cleaned weight, 450 pounds; split weight,\r\n  300 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pig Tongues.=--Various uses are made of this piece of meat. They are\r\nvery extensively used in canning factories where they are put up and\r\nknown as “lunch tongue”; they are also used in different kinds of\r\nsausage, and are put up to quite an extent in vinegar pickle. When\r\nhandled in the latter manner the following suggestions are of practical\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe tongues after being trimmed should be cured in a 75-degree plain\r\nsalt pickle using three ounces of saltpetre to 100 pounds of tongue.\r\nAfter the tongues are fully cured, which will require from eight to\r\ntwelve days, they are scalded, the outer surface of the tongue being\r\nscraped off. In some instances the scalding is done before the tongues\r\nare put in the pickle. Either way is proper. After being scraped and\r\ncleaned they are cooked as desired and afterward pickled in a white\r\nwine vinegar pickle of 45-degree strength. The following tests will\r\nshow the cost of tongues packed in different sized packages, the cost\r\nbeing determined by the cost of meat and supplies at the time tests\r\nwere made:\r\n\r\nTEST ON 1,000 PIECES, OR 910 POUNDS PIG TONGUES.\r\n\r\n    _Debit:_\r\n  910 pounds pig tongues, at 6¹⁄₄c per pound                   $56.88\r\n  Scraping at 15c per 100 pieces                                1.50\r\n  Counting, cooking, etc., three hours at 18c per hour           .54\r\n  Trimming at 5c per 100 pieces                                  .50\r\n  Miscellaneous labor                                            .20\r\n  Administrative expense, 47c per 100 on 560 pounds produced    2.63\r\n                                                              ------\r\n    Total                                                     $62.25\r\n\r\n      _Credit:_\r\n  Green weight, 910 pounds; cooked weight, 560 pounds;\r\n    shrinkage, 38 per cent.\r\n  Trimming 112 pounds at 1¹⁄₂c                                  1.68\r\n                                                              ------\r\n    Net cost                                                  $60.57\r\n\r\n  Cost per pound, 10⁴⁄₅c; cost handling per cwt., including\r\n  administrative expense, $0.665 per 100 pounds finished.\r\n\r\nCOST OF ONE BARREL PIG TONGUES PACKED AT 190 POUNDS NET.\r\n\r\n  190 pounds pig tongues at 10⁴⁄₅c per pound  $20.52\r\n  One barrel                                     .78\r\n  Packing, one-half hour at 17¹⁄₂c per hour      .09\r\n  Pickle, ten gallons at 2¹⁄₂c per gallon        .25\r\n  Coopering, one-sixth hour at 25c per hour      .04\r\n  Spices, 2c                                     .02\r\n  Miscellaneous labor                            .03\r\n                                              ------\r\n    Total cost per barrel                     $21.73\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formula for Export Hog Tongue Pickle._--There is at times quite a\r\ndemand for fresh pig tongues in Liverpool and other foreign points,\r\nin which case the trade demands that they arrive there without being\r\nsalt-cured. The following formula will be found very valuable for\r\nthis purpose and also point out how to carry tongues without salting\r\nthem, when it is desired to do so: Use 116 pounds of boracic acid,\r\nfifty-eight pounds of borax, twenty-nine pounds of fine salt and seven\r\nand one-quarter pounds of saltpetre.\r\n\r\nThe method of mixing is as follows: The boracic acid and borax are\r\nput into a vat containing sixty gallons of water. The vat should be\r\nconnected with steam supply so that it can be brought to the boiling\r\npoint, cooking same slowly and stirring it well for half an hour. The\r\nsalt and saltpetre is then added and should be stirred until thoroughly\r\ndissolved. After the solution has been allowed to cool, add sufficient\r\ncold water to give it a strength of 21 degrees by salometer test. Chill\r\nthe solution to a temperature of 38° F. The tongues should be trimmed\r\nand thoroughly chilled, it being essential that they are in perfect\r\ncondition. They should then be packed in a tierce, after which the\r\ntierce is filled with the preservative. Tongue should be shipped in\r\nrefrigerator cars where the temperature is not allowed to go above 38°\r\nF.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pig Snouts.=--These consist of the snout of the hog together with the\r\nupper lips and front part of the nose. During preparation they are\r\nhandled very much in the same manner as pig’s feet. They are first\r\nshaved and cleaned, afterward scalded, removing the outer skin or\r\nmembrane of the nose. Then they are cured, using a 90-degree plain salt\r\npickle and adding thereto three ounces of saltpetre to 100 pounds of\r\nsnouts. After they are fully cured, which will require from five to\r\neight days, they should be cooked in a wooden vat to the desired degree\r\nof tenderness after which they are chilled in cold water and pickled in\r\nwhite wine vinegar of 45-degree strength. The following tests show the\r\ncost of preparing pig snouts in different sized packages:\r\n\r\nTEST ON 1,060 PIECES, OR 1,000 POUNDS PIG SNOUTS.\r\n\r\n    _Debit:_\r\n  Cost of 1,000 pounds pig snouts at 2¹⁄₂c per pound       $25.00\r\n  Shaving at 40c per 100 pieces                              4.24\r\n  Labor, trucking, cooking, inspecting, pickling, etc.       1.10\r\n  100 pounds salt at ¹⁄₄c per pound                           .25\r\n  Two pounds saltpetre at 5c per pound                        .10\r\n  Administrative expenses, 47c per 100 pounds on 610 pounds\r\n  production                                                 2.87\r\n                                                           ------\r\n    Total                                                  $33.56\r\n\r\n    _Credit:_\r\n  Trimmings, 90 pounds at 2c per pound                       1.80\r\n                                                           ------\r\n    Net cost                                               $31.76\r\n\r\n  Cost per pound, 5¹⁄₅c; cost of handling, administrative expense,\r\n  85⁶⁄₁₀c per cwt.\r\n\r\n  Green weight, 1,000 pounds; cleaned weight, 900 pounds; cooked\r\n  weight, 610 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nLARD, COMPOUND AND GREASES\r\n\r\n\r\n  HISTORICAL -- QUANTITY AND QUALITY -- NEUTRAL LARD -- KETTLE RENDERED\r\n  LARD -- PRIME STEAM LARD -- REFINED LARD -- BLEACHING LARD -- FILTER\r\n  PRESS -- LARD ROLL -- LARD PACKING -- COMPOUND LARD -- COTTONSEED\r\n  OIL -- REFINING CRUDE OIL -- DEODORIZING COTTONSEED OIL -- PRESSING\r\n  TEMPERATURES -- LARD OIL -- TREATMENT FOR LARD GREASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Historical.=--The refining of lard in packing houses is comparatively\r\nrecent, and many people will be surprised to know that even the largest\r\npackers only added lard refining to their business within the past\r\ntwenty-five to thirty years. Previous to that time lard refineries\r\nwere operated by independent firms, who bought their supply of prime\r\n“steam” lard, converting it into the different grades in their own\r\nestablishments. In the natural evolution of the business this branch\r\nwas taken up by the packers.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of present methods, lard refining consisted in\r\npressing from the lard about 30 to 40 per cent lard oil, sold for\r\nlubricating and lighting purposes, etc., and mixing the stearine with\r\nstraight lard, making a high grade pure lard. At this time the method\r\nof bleaching in all lard refineries was accomplished by the use of\r\ncaustic soda, pearl ash, lime, alum, or other substances, the principal\r\ningredient, being caustic soda. The underlying principle is that\r\nalkali, used in proper proportion, saponified the acid in the lard.\r\nThis process, however, is a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quantity and Quality.=--As shown in a previous chapter from thirteen\r\nto fifteen percent of the live weight of the hog is fresh lard,\r\nconsequently where large numbers of hogs are killed the manufacture of\r\nlard is an important factor in the packing business. The principal\r\ngrades are known as neutral lard, kettle rendered lard, prime steam\r\nlard, refined lard and compound lard.\r\n\r\nTallow and stearine also enter into the manufacture of refined and\r\ncompound lards.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Neutral Lard.=--When oleomargarine was first manufactured it was\r\nconsidered necessary to use natural butter in the mixture in order to\r\ngive it the proper consistency, as the oleo oil was grainy and coarse,\r\ntherefore sufficient natural butter was added to change that condition.\r\nSome one conceived the idea of using neutral lard made from leaf lard\r\nin place of natural butter in oleomargarine. When this was worked out\r\nsuccessfully the term oleomargarine practically disappeared and the\r\nterm “butterine” was substituted. In most of the butterine made today\r\nno natural butter is used.\r\n\r\nThe conditions in making oleo oil and tallows have their parallel in\r\nneutral lard and kettle rendered lard. When leaf lard is cooked for\r\nkettle rendered lard, if a temperature of from 250° to 260° F. is\r\nobtained the tissues of the lard are burned or partially consumed, this\r\nheat giving it a flavor which is called “high kettle rendered” flavor.\r\nWhen it is made into neutral this condition is reversed, the lard being\r\nmelted at a temperature of from 126° to 128° F. At this temperature no\r\nburning of tissues is possible, hence the oil extract is neutral in\r\nevery sense of the word, in color, flavor and smell. With these three\r\nessential points the material readily forms the chief substance for\r\nbutterine by adding milk or cream and oleo oil and cotton seed oil, as\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Neutral.=--The following steps define the process of\r\nmanufacture necessary to produce neutral:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chilling._--The leaves as pulled from the hogs are rapidly sent to a\r\ncooling room to be thoroughly chilled. The leaves are spread separately\r\nin flat sheets on metal supports, which are preferable to wood. If it\r\nis chilled too slowly a strong “hoggy” flavor is developed, which it is\r\nimpossible to eradicate from the fresh product. The leaf lard should be\r\nchilled for twenty-four hours in a temperature of 32° to 34° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Melting._--It is put through a hasher of the Enterprise type to an\r\nopen top water jacketed kettle, similar in type to an oleo kettle.\r\nFrequently the melting kettle is a wooden vat with a galvanized iron\r\nkettle inside, the space between the wooden vat and the galvanized\r\nkettle being filled with water which is heated to the desired\r\ntemperature for melting the product. It is not practicable to use a\r\nsteam jacket as the heat would be excessive and it would be difficult\r\nto control. This kettle properly is water jacketed and open top so no\r\npressure is generated.\r\n\r\nIn a kettle holding 4,000 to 5,000 pounds, water should be warmed in\r\nthe jacket before lard is put in, the agitator started slowly, not\r\nto exceed 10 to 12 revolutions per minute, and the heat should be\r\nregulated so as to have the lard all melted and ready to drop in one\r\nand one-half hours from the time of starting to hash. By the time the\r\nlard is thoroughly melted the temperature should be 126° to 128° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Settling._--As soon as the lard is melted it should be drawn off with\r\na siphon into receiving kettles, which are also jacketed and held at\r\npractically the same temperature. When dropped it should be salted with\r\none-half to one per cent of fine salt, letting it stand from fifteen to\r\nthirty minutes. In drawing off it should be siphoned through several\r\nlayers of cheese cloth, forming a strainer, into receiving tanks,\r\nwhere it should settle four hours. It is drawn into tierces through a\r\npipe raised from the bottom to leave one and one-half to two inches of\r\nlard in the tank, care being taken that no “bottoms” are drawn into\r\nthe tierce, as these contain tissues which are, for the most part,\r\nundiscernible; also moisture. These ingredients in neutral, being only\r\npartially cooked, immediately begin to decompose. It is a delicate\r\narticle to handle and the settling of all impurities is important. The\r\nneutral, when drawn into tierces, should be at a temperature of from\r\n115° to 118° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Storage._--The tierced lard should be kept at a temperature of about\r\n75° F. for about ten or fifteen hours, and then put into a cooler\r\nwith a temperature of from 45° to 50° F. The tierces should be filled\r\nthrough the bilge and not closed when stored in the first mentioned\r\ntemperature, the bungs being left out, while the heat is permitted\r\nto escape, thus carrying with it considerable flavor, and making the\r\nmaterial more neutral than if the tierces were closed as soon as\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n=No. 2 Neutral Lard.=--This is a neutral lard made from back fat. At\r\ntimes it is profitable to make this product into No. 2 neutral instead\r\nof steam lard, for when the market for No. 1 neutral is extremely high\r\nthere is demand for a good No. 2. When making this, the rind should\r\nbe skinned off from the back fat, leaving clear back fat to be hashed\r\nfor neutral. If the rinds are put in, it gives the product a “hoggy”\r\nflavor, which makes it undesirable. It is hashed and melted the same\r\nas No. 1 neutral, except as to temperature, the melting point for this\r\nbeing 132° to 134° F., method and apparatus as described for the making\r\nof No. 1 neutral, being applicable to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Test--Pure Steam Lard vs. Neutral._--Below is a test on raw leaf lard\r\nrendered into neutral, showing yield, and percentage of the neutral\r\nlard produced; the scrap and bottoms from the kettle being run into\r\nkettle rendered lard.\r\n\r\nTEST ON LEAF LARD RENDERED INTO NEUTRAL.\r\n\r\n  Raw leaves       8,958 pounds at $0.08¹⁄₈ per pound =          $727.84\r\n  Salt for settling   35 pounds at  4.90    per ton   =              .09\r\n                                                                 -------\r\n                                                                 $727.93\r\n\r\n  _Production:_\r\n\r\n  Neutral lard    7,880 pounds at  $0.09125 per pound = $718.96\r\n  Neutral bottoms 1,055 pounds\r\n    (Run under forty pounds pressure two and one-half\r\n    hours.)\r\n  Prime steam lard  497 pounds at  0.082 per pound    =   40.75\r\n  Tankage            56 pounds at 18.00  per ton      =     .45\r\n                                                        -------  $760.16\r\n                                                                 -------\r\n  Gain on production                                             $ 32.23\r\n\r\n  Gain per 100 pounds on raw weight, $0.036.\r\n\r\n  _Percentage Production:_\r\n\r\n  Neutral lard to raw weight             87.97\r\n  Neutral bottoms to raw weight          11.78\r\n  Prime steam lard to raw weight          5.55\r\n  Tankage to raw weight                    .63\r\n  Prime steam lard to weight of bottoms  47.11\r\n  Tankage to weight of bottoms            5.31\r\n\r\n    Total production of lards            93.52\r\n    Total production of raw weights      94.15\r\n\r\n    _Tanking Leaf Lard:_\r\n\r\n  Raw leaves       1,000 pounds at $ 0.08125 per pound = $81.25\r\n  Prime steam lard   929 pounds at   0.0825  per pound =  76.18\r\n  Tankage              5 pounds at  18.00    per ton\r\n                                                         ------\r\n    Loss on production                                   $ 5.07\r\n    Loss per pound on raw weight                          .0051\r\n\r\n  Prime steam lard to raw weight, per cent, 92.9.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Test--Chilling and Tanking._--\r\n\r\nTEST ON CHILLED LEAF LARD TO DETERMINE VALUE AND YIELD.\r\n\r\n      Warm leaf lard to cooler                 1,000 lbs.\r\n      Chilled leaf lard                          986 lbs.\r\n      Shrinkage, 1.4 per cent                     14 lbs.\r\n    Weight to test tank, 986 pounds; value per cwt., $7,556.\r\n  Yield prime steam lard  94.12 per cent; 928 lbs. at $8.025 per\r\n  cwt.                                                            $74.47\r\n  Yield tankage (pressed)   .81 per cent;   8 lbs. at  9.89 per\r\n  ton                                                                .04\r\n                                                                  ------\r\n    Total                                                         $74.51\r\n\r\n\r\n_Test._--Showing manipulation of 5,000 pounds of back fat to make\r\nneutral, kettle rendered lard and pure steamed lard:\r\n\r\nTEST ON 5,000 POUNDS OF BACK FAT CONVERTED TO NO. 2 NEUTRAL KETTLE\r\nRENDERED LARD AND PRIME STEAM LARD.\r\n\r\n                                                          Net wt.

While\r\nkettle rendered lard is sold under the label of “pure leaf lard” there\r\nis little leaf used, as this part is worth more as a neutral lard than\r\nwhen made into kettle rendered. A very acceptable formula for kettle\r\nrendered lard, if handled properly, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  70 per cent back fat;\r\n  15 per cent leaf scraped lard, which is pieces of leaf, scraped out of\r\n     the hog after the leaf lard has been pulled, and thoroughly\r\n     chilled;\r\n  15 per cent lard stearine.\r\n\r\nWhere neutral lard and kettle rendered lard are made together a nice\r\nflavor may be imparted to the kettle rendered lard by using the bottoms\r\nof neutral lard when cooking it, as the scrap from the neutral when\r\nbrought to the high temperature of kettle rendered lard imparts a rich\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Process for Kettle Rendered Lard._--The raw product is put through a\r\nhasher which cuts the fat tissues, so that when the heat is applied the\r\noil readily separates. The kettle generally used for this purpose is\r\nabout five feet in diameter and from five to seven feet deep, made of\r\nwrought iron, jacketed for steam, with an agitator to keep the product\r\nagitated while cooking. The jacket should be kept heated until through\r\nhashing, then increased until the temperature of the lard reaches 255°\r\nto 260° F., when the pressure should be shut off for one and one-half\r\nhours at least--one and one-half hours should be taken to reach this\r\nperiod. If lard stearine is used it should be added at this time,\r\nusing about 15 per cent for the summer formula. After this period of\r\nshut-off, again turn on the steam, holding temperature, allowing the\r\ncontents to cook until dry, or until no further steam arises, which\r\nwill consume probably from thirty to forty-five minutes. Stop agitating\r\nand add twenty pounds of salt, let stand to settle one hour, then lower\r\ninto the kettle below, strain through a cloth sieve, the lard being\r\ntaken off the scrap with a siphon. The scrap will remain in the bottom\r\nof the cooking kettle; if handled carefully, very little will pass\r\nthrough the pipe. The lard, when being drawn into the kettle below,\r\nshould be passed through several thicknesses of cheese cloth in order\r\nto catch any small pieces of scrap or tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Settling._--After the lard is lowered into the settling kettle,\r\nallow it to stand two to three hours, then siphon to a third kettle,\r\nas considerable scrap will have gone through into the lard from the\r\ncooking kettle, strain it through a double thickness of cheese cloth\r\nstretched over a frame. In the third kettle a scum will arise on it,\r\nwhich should be immediately skimmed off, and about ten pounds of fine\r\nsalt added to a 5,000-pound batch, to aid in settling. If convenient,\r\nit is advisable to allow the lard to settle in this kettle for twelve\r\nhours before drawing it off, although this length of time is not\r\nnecessary, but a perfect settlement of the impurities is necessary to\r\nmake the best lard.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scrap._--After the lard is drawn from the cooking kettle, the scrap\r\nshould be drawn from the bottom. This scrap is used in the prime steam\r\nlard tank. If, however, there is no other provision for handling the\r\nscrap, it should be put into a hoop press (Fig. 150), and pressure\r\napplied, thereby liberating all the oil left in the residue, the scrap\r\nthen being used as “pressed scrap.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Packing and Cooling._--Kettle rendered lard is usually sold and used\r\nmore extensively during the cooler weather. It is very desirable that\r\nthere should be a light, fluffy top. This is only possible when the\r\nlard is drawn hot in a cool room; chilling the lard rapidly causes this\r\nappearance at the top, which is always looked upon by the trade as a\r\nmark of excellence. When the lard is drawn off into small packages they\r\nare placed one on top of the other, covering the top with paper. The\r\ncover should not be put on the package until it is chilled, otherwise\r\nthe fluffy appearance is lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.--HOOP PRESS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drawing Temperatures._--When drawn into wooden packages, such as ten,\r\ntwenty or fifty pound pails, lard should be drawn at 150° F. If drawn\r\ninto tins it should be drawn off at 175° to 180° F.; when drawn into\r\ntierces, barrels or half barrels it should be drawn at about 130° F.\r\nWhen drawing lard into wooden packages they should be silicated the day\r\nbefore, giving them ample time to dry, as this prevents the packages\r\nfrom soaking up the lard and also prevents excessive shrinkage of the\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Refining Prime Steam Lard.=--Refined prime steam lard is made into two\r\nproducts, pure refined lard and lard with beef fat added.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pure Refined Lard.=--Pure refined lard consists of prime steam lard\r\nwith lard stearine added. This is a product resulting when prime steam\r\nlard is pressed to obtain lard oil, a process described later; however,\r\nthe quantity available is quite limited. Descriptions will be confined\r\nto the making of lard with beef fat added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.--SECTION THROUGH TANK FOR MIXING FULLERS EARTH\r\nAND LARD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fullers Earth.=--About thirty years ago the method of refining\r\nlard with fullers earth was first inaugurated, and for years only\r\nimported earth from England was thought suitable for this purpose.\r\nDeposits of fullers earth, of fair quality, have been discovered in\r\nthe United States and American fullers earth is today used in some\r\nlard refineries. Indications are that with improvements in mining and\r\nmethods of grinding, and possibly also in the discovery of better beds\r\nor layers of this substance, manufacturers will not continue to go\r\nabroad for supplies of fullers earth.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of how fullers earth bleaches lard and its kindred fats\r\nwould be interesting, if anyone knew the exact explanation, but so\r\nfar there has been no scientific reason given that accounts for this\r\nproperty of this material, therefore no chemical test can be applied\r\nto different samples of fullers earth to determine whether they are\r\nsuitable for refining or not. The only safe test is the practical one\r\nof heating a sample together with lard and watching the result of the\r\nbleach.\r\n\r\nFullers earth is used for bleaching cotton seed oil and other greases\r\nand fats which are subjected to the bleaching process. In improving\r\nthe color of lard it is done at the expense of flavor, and a wholesome\r\nodor, which is natural to the lard, is sacrificed in a greater or\r\nlesser degree to the advantage of color. The tendency is to make lard\r\nwhite, even though it loses in odor and taste. In compounding lard this\r\nis intensified by the general use of tallow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--FULLERS EARTH KETTLE FOR SMALL HOUSES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bleaching Kettle.=--This can be of a predominant size dependent\r\nupon the volume of business. For a moderate business the most\r\nsuitable dimensions are about six feet in diameter and four feet\r\ndeep. A sectional view of such a kettle is shown in Fig. 151 and a\r\nsmaller kettle is illustrated in Fig. 152. It was the practice to use\r\ncompressed air for agitation so as to mix the fullers earth with the\r\nlard. This has been discontinued in the best refineries, as it was\r\nfound that agitation with air had a tendency to make the lard turn\r\nrancid more readily than if agitated by mechanical device.\r\n\r\nThe kettle is supplied with a vertical shaft, to the bottom of which\r\nis attached a propellor about fourteen inches in diameter. Around this\r\nis fitted a wire screen about thirty inches high made of galvanized\r\nwire, ³⁄₁₆-inch mesh, this screen clearing the blades of the fan about\r\nan inch. On top of this screen is fixed an iron pipe approaching to\r\nwithin about eighteen inches of the surface of the lard when the kettle\r\nis filled. A kettle of this size will hold about 5,000 pounds of lard\r\nfor treatment. The agitating blade should revolve at a speed of from\r\n125 to 175 revolutions per minute. This has the effect of producing a\r\nminiature whirlpool in the body of lard by driving the lard through the\r\nscreen against the sides of the kettle, where it rises to the surface\r\nand goes down through the funnel-shaped tube to be again driven through\r\nthe screen. In this way the fullers earth is thoroughly mixed in and if\r\nthere is a tendency to “lump” the lumps are readily broken up by impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bleaching Lard.=--If cold lard is used it should be melted and any\r\nsediment or moisture which settles should be drawn off. It is best not\r\nto draw off too close to the bottom so as to avoid any moisture.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which lard should be bleached is an important matter\r\nto be determined. If the lard has been heavily cooked and has a strong\r\nsteam flavor, a temperature of 180° F. is correct. If the lard has\r\nnot been well cooked a somewhat lower temperature is necessary. As a\r\nrule the lower the temperature at which bleaching is done, the more\r\nfullers earth is required to get the proper bleach and at the same\r\ntime as little earth flavor as possible is a point for careful and\r\nintelligent consideration. The best way to determine, where there are\r\nlarge quantities of lard, is to take a small sample and make tests in\r\nthe laboratory. The point to be obtained is to get the bleach with as\r\nlittle of the flavor of the earth as possible. Generally speaking, from\r\nthree-fourths to one and one-half per cent of fullers earth will get\r\nthe desired result.\r\n\r\nWhen the lard is brought to the proper temperature, fullers earth is\r\nput in the kettle, when it is agitated from eight to twelve minutes,\r\nthen pumped through the filter press as rapidly as possible. It takes a\r\ncertain length of time for fullers earth to do its work properly, and a\r\nstrong agitation of from eight to twelve minutes appears to be the best\r\nmethod to adopt in order to obtain the full effect of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Refining Tallow Separately.=--Where tallow is used in lard, it is\r\nalways advisable to bleach the tallow separately. This is done in the\r\nsame manner as described for lard, with the exception that about three\r\nper cent of fullers earth is used, after which it is pumped through the\r\nfilter press and into the receiving tanks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.--FILTER PRESS.]\r\n\r\nWhen it is compounded with the lard, the desired amount should be put\r\ninto the kettle with the lard after it is treated. The same is true\r\nof oleo-stearine, except that in the bleaching of this article from\r\none-half to one and one-half per cent of fuller earth is sufficient.\r\nMeasures must be taken to see that ingredients are intimately mixed\r\nbefore passing the product to the rolls.\r\n\r\nThe use of tallow or stearine is for the purpose of cheapening the\r\nproduct, as well as hardening it, the formula for same being made\r\naccording to the values and conditions under which the lard is to\r\nbe sold. For instance lard going south, or into a warm climate,\r\nis made much harder than lard for a temperate climate; hence lard\r\nformulas, generally speaking, are worthless for general use, the\r\ndifferent formulas being made to suit widely different conditions, and\r\ntheir availability also depends to a considerable extent upon the\r\nfluctuation of values.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Filter Press.=--After the contents of the kettle have been pumped\r\nthrough the filter air pressure should be turned into the filter press\r\nin order to blow out all the lard possible. After this live steam\r\nshould be turned on, expelling the balance of the lard from the pipe. A\r\nlarge portion of this latter lard, however, is unfit to be used again,\r\nas it contains sediment and fullers earth combined, having a rank,\r\nstrong odor, and can be used only for grease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.--LARD COOLING CYLINDER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lard Roll.=--This is a device provided for cooling lard in a film\r\nso as to bring plenty of air in contact with the surface during the\r\ncongealing. After the lard has been put through the filtering press it\r\ngoes to a receiving tank and is next passed over rollers for chilling.\r\n(Fig. 154.) These are cast iron cylinders containing refrigerated\r\nbrine. The cylinders revolve at from ten to fourteen revolutions per\r\nminute, the lard being congealed on the outer surface. Fixed against\r\nthe side of the cylinder is the edge of a steel knife which scrapes\r\nclose to its surface. The lard, in contact with the cool surface of\r\nthe cylinders, congeals and as it passes to the knife it is removed\r\nand drops into the trough. Here it is thoroughly beaten by a revolving\r\nshaft with pickers on it, so that all lumps are broken and the grain\r\nis of a smooth, even consistency. Pure lard passes to an agitator,\r\nwhich is a jacketed kettle, where it is given a thorough agitation\r\nand drawn off cool as possible, the object being to have the different\r\ningredients thoroughly mixed at a low temperature.\r\n\r\nAt times rolls are used in tandem. When a bountiful supply of cold\r\nwater, say at 60° F., is available, the saving in refrigeration\r\njustifies the use of tandem rolls. In this instance the first roll is\r\nelevated so as to gravitate the lard to the feed of the second.\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF LARD PACKAGES.\r\n\r\n  =====================+================+=========\r\n                       |     Weight     |   Avg.\r\n     Weight packages   |    material    |  weight\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------\r\n      3-POUND PAILS:   |                |\r\n  100 pails            | 43 lbs.,  7 oz.| 6.95 oz.\r\n  100 bails            |  5 lbs.,  4 oz.|  .84 oz.\r\n  100 covers           |  9 lbs.,  7 oz.| 1.51 oz.\r\n  100 summer covers    |  6 lbs.,  3 oz.|  .99 oz.\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------\r\n    Average weight each|       ...      |10.29 oz.\r\n                       |                |\r\n      5-POUND PAILS:   |                |\r\n  100 pails            | 58 lbs., 12 oz.| 9.40 oz.\r\n  100 bails            |  5 lbs., 15 oz.|  .95 oz.\r\n  100 covers           | 13 lbs.        | 2.08 oz.\r\n  100 summer covers    |  8 lbs., 10 oz.| 1.38 oz.\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------\r\n    Average weight each|       ...      |13.81 oz.\r\n                       |                |\r\n    10-POUND PAILS:    |                |\r\n  100 pails            | 92 lbs., 14 oz.|14.86 oz.\r\n  100 bails            |  7 lbs., 12 oz.| 1.24 oz.\r\n  100 covers           | 19 lbs.,  5 oz.| 3.09 oz.\r\n  100 summer covers    | 13 lbs., 10 oz.| 2.18 oz.\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------\r\n    Average weight each|       ...      |21.37 oz.\r\n                       |                |\r\n    20-POUND PAILS:    |                |\r\n  100 pails            |144 lbs., 15 oz.|23.19 oz.\r\n  100 bails            | 10 lbs.,  9 oz.| 1.69 oz.\r\n  100 covers           | 34 lbs.        | 5.44 oz.\r\n  100 summer covers    | 22 lbs.,  4 oz.| 3.56 oz.\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------\r\n    Average weight each|       ...      |33.88 oz.\r\n                       |                |\r\n  40-POUND SQUARE CANS:|                |\r\n  100 cans             |268 lbs.,  8 oz.|42.96 oz.\r\n  100 caps             |  2 lbs.,  8 oz.|  .40 oz.\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------\r\n    Average weight each|       ...      |43.36 oz.\r\n                       |                |\r\n   50-POUND ROUND CANS:|                |\r\n  100 cans             |270 lbs., 10 oz.|43.30 oz.\r\n  100 covers           | 50 lbs.,  2 oz.| 8.02 oz.\r\n  100 summer covers    | 38 lbs., 12 oz.| 6.20 oz.\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------\r\n    Average weight each|       ...      |57.52 oz.\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lard Packing.=--Refined lard is not usually drawn in a cooler. In most\r\nclimates the non-refrigerated rooms will suffice. It is packed in tubs,\r\nbarrels or tierces of wood. The lard, when available, in the picker\r\ntrough, is usually chilled and stiff. The use of a pump is made to\r\nwithdraw and force it through a strainer in an enlarged section of the\r\npipe, so as to effectually break all lumps. A relief valve should be\r\nplaced on the line to spill into the picker in case the draw cocks are\r\nall suddenly closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lard Packages.=--In wooden packages tare is deducted. The table on\r\npreceding page shows the actual weight of the different packages which\r\nare usually made from an X L grade of tin. Inasmuch as lard sells at\r\nmore per pound than the tin costs, there is always an endeavor to get\r\nthe packages as heavy as consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Country Style Lard.=--Many moderate sized plants that do not cater\r\nto a trade accustomed to highly refined lard, prefer to make kettle\r\nrendered lard as most of their output, using leaf, back fat and\r\ntrimmings, adding the complimentary proportion of killing lard and\r\nagitating the whole in a water jacketed agitator. All implements used\r\nare similar to those described previously, also the method of drawing\r\nfrom the agitator to packages is the same. Beef fat can be rendered in\r\nthe same way when oleo departments are not operated, and it can thus be\r\nused to good advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Compound--What it is.=--Compound is a substitute for lard and is\r\nmade of cotton seed oil and oleo stearine, or tallow, or both. The\r\nformula on this article varies according to the relative values of the\r\ningredients. The generally accepted formula is 80 per cent cotton seed\r\noil, and 20 per cent oleo stearine.\r\n\r\nIf the market price of oleo stearine is high, a formula may be\r\nsubstituted as follows: 75 per cent cotton seed oil, 7¹⁄₂ percent\r\ntallow, 17¹⁄₂ per cent oleo stearine. In cold weather even a smaller\r\namount of stearine may be used and a proportionately larger amount of\r\ntallow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cottonseed Oil.=--This is a product derived from cotton seed. Before\r\nthe manufacture of cotton seed oil, the cotton seed, removed from the\r\ncotton, was thrown in large compost heaps and after decomposition, was\r\nused sparingly as a fertilizer. An idea of its value may be gained from\r\nthe following table. From one ton of seed, by average, is obtained:\r\n\r\n  270 pounds or 36 gallons of oil at 28c per gallon  $10.08\r\n  750 pounds cotton seed meal at 90c per 100 pounds    6.75\r\n  850 pounds hulls at 15c per 100 pounds               1.27\r\n   30 pounds lint at 3¹⁄₂c                             1.05\r\n                                                     ------\r\n    Total value                                      $19.15\r\n\r\n  100 pounds waste and dirt.\r\n\r\nThe oil when extracted from the seed is termed “crude oil.” In refining\r\nthis oil the loss varies from 7 per cent to 12 per cent, on an average\r\nabout 9¹⁄₄ per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Refining Crude Oil.=--The crude oil is purchased by refiners and\r\ntreated to produce “yellow oil.” In this process it is put into a tank\r\n(it is generally considered profitable to refine cotton seed oil only\r\nin large quantities) supplied with a revolving agitator. Into the\r\ntank is put a solution of eighteen to twenty per cent caustic soda.\r\nThe quantity and strength of the solution necessary is determined\r\nby treating a small sample. To a small sample of oil add the soda\r\nsolution, stirring continuously, having it heated to a temperature of\r\n160° to 180° F. When sufficient soda lye has been added a floculent\r\nprecipitation will be noticed. This indicates a “breaking” of the oil.\r\nBy calculation of the relative amount the comparative quantities can be\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\nAn excessive amount of lye will saponify its equivalent in good oil,\r\ntherefore care must be exercised to see that only the proper amount\r\nis used. In a practical way the soda is introduced in the crude oil\r\nsolution and agitation is started to insure the thorough mixing of\r\nthe caustic soda and the oil. The floculent substance appearing, the\r\nagitation is stopped and the oil allowed to settle, the sediment and\r\nsubstance other than oil collecting at the bottom of the tank. A small\r\nquantity (about one-quarter of one per cent by weight) of fullers\r\nearth is added and the oil removed by pumping through a filter press\r\nproducing what is known to the trade as “yellow oil.”\r\n\r\nThe sediment, known as “foots” is collected in kettles and treated with\r\nadditional lye, boiled and settled with salt; water added, settled and\r\ndrawn. This treatment is duplicated as many times as necessary, until\r\nthe soap stock will separate from impurities. When thoroughly settled\r\ndraw the soap stock into packages for the soap trade. The finished\r\n“foots” contains about 33 to 40 per cent of moisture and a small\r\npercentage of lye.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Deodorizing Cotton Seed Oil.=--The “yellow oil” of trade has a\r\ndecided flavor which it is desirable to remove, and this process is\r\naccomplished by deodorizing. (See Fig. 155.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treating Tank._--This tank is equipped for heating the oil to a\r\nvery high temperature by the introduction of a large coil surface,\r\npreferably rings, one within the other and arranged so that each ring\r\nis accessible. The kettle coils, etc., should be made extra heavy. The\r\ntop of the kettle must also be hooded and as the oil boils violently\r\nthe steam must be given free opportunity to escape. The escape pipe\r\nshould be at least sixteen to twenty inches in diameter in a tank six\r\nfeet in diameter, and should be provided with a goose neck, so that the\r\nsteam rising which condenses, does not drip back into the tank. Fig.\r\n155 show the construction of an oil treating tank.\r\n\r\nThe exhaust pipe extends into the atmosphere a short distance above the\r\ndeodorizing tanks. On account of the extreme agitation caused by the\r\nheat, the oil is likely to boil over and waste. Special attention is\r\ncalled to the crook or neck in the exhaust pipe with two-inch outlet at\r\nthe lowest point. This is done so that the condensation will not run\r\nback into the oil, but can be taken out at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Process For Oil.=--The tank is filled with oil to about half its\r\ncapacity. The oil is then heated to a temperature of 320° to 360° F.\r\nAfter being held at this temperature for an hour to an hour and a\r\nhalf, it is ready for the washing process. This is done by means of a\r\ntwo-inch perforated pipe at the top of the kettle, through which is\r\nsprinkled cold water on the oil. The extreme temperature evaporates the\r\nwater very rapidly and at the same time causes a precipitation. The\r\nwater should be allowed to run for five minutes, and then the body of\r\noil should stand for from one to two hours. The cone, or bottom of the\r\nkettle, will be found to have a sediment which has been precipitated\r\nfrom the oil. This “bottom” should be drawn off, and the steam again\r\nturned on the coils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--DEODORIZING TANK FOR COTTON SEED OILS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blowing._--The oil is heated to the original temperature and steam\r\nof high pressure and temperature introduced into the body of the oil.\r\nThe length of time required for treating the oil depends largely upon\r\nits nature, some oils being more neutral and more nearly odorless than\r\nothers, consequently no exact rule can be laid down that would fit all\r\ncases; it must be left to the judgment of the person handling the oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pressure and Temperature._--To obtain the temperature above mentioned\r\na pressure of 150 pounds should be carried, and late practice\r\nintroduces a superheater for reheating the steam to insure high\r\ntemperature by adding 100° to 150° F. to the steam temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.--SECTION OF BOTTOM OF DEODORIZING TANK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bleaching Process._--As soon as the oil is deodorized it is drawn off\r\nand allowed to cool. It is pumped into the treating kettle, or what is\r\nknown in refineries as the “dirt” kettle. There it is brought up to\r\na temperature of 160° F., when the fullers earth is added, generally\r\nusing from one to two percent of earth with this bleach, following an\r\nagitation of about ten minutes. It should then be pumped through the\r\nfilter press into the receiving tank, where it is held until used.\r\nAfter going through this process the oil is known to the trade as\r\n“water white.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.--SECTION THROUGH EXHAUST HOOD OF DEODORIZING\r\nTANK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mixing._--Refined tallow or oleo stearine melted and clarified by\r\npumping through a filter press without the use of fullers earth is\r\nadded to the cotton seed oil so prepared, and the mixed substance,\r\ncontaining proportions previously described, are ready for passing over\r\nthe cooling roll.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Filter Press._--The filter press (Fig. 158) should not be used more\r\nthan two or three times until it is taken apart, all the sediment and\r\ndirt removed and clean cloths substituted. Continued use of filter\r\ncloths, without proper cleaning, has a deteriorating effect upon the\r\nmaterial pumped through the presses, and different kinds of products\r\nshould not be passed through the same press.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Color and Roll Treatment._--Color is an important feature of compound,\r\nwhen an odorless oil has been produced. The mixture passed to the rolls\r\nis usually at a temperature of 120° F. and this heated body of material\r\namounting to 4000 pounds per hour on an eight foot roll requires a very\r\nlarge capacity of refrigerating equipment.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to maintain a brine temperature in the shell of from\r\nzero to five degrees above. A fifty-ton refrigerating equipment of\r\ncommercial rating is inadequate for this duty. Consequently compound\r\nmanufacturers must have ample refrigerating machine capacity.\r\n\r\nThe lard roll is preferably of the size noted and should operate at not\r\nto exceed seven revolutions per minute, provided brine of the above\r\ntemperature is supplied; fewer revolutions if temperature is higher,\r\nwhich naturally reduces the capacity.\r\n\r\nThe lard roll, pump, and strainer equipment is the same as described\r\nfor lard, except that the lard is packed directly from the picker\r\ntrough without the use of an additional agitator.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hydrogenation of Oils.=--A new process has been devised whereby soft\r\noils, such as cotton seed oil, can be hardened so as to make a purer\r\nvegetable product. The substance has quite a large field but it is not\r\nintimately connected with the packing business.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cotton Seed Stearine.=--This is a purchasable product and is used at\r\ntimes as a substitute for oleo stearine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lard Oil.=--The production of lard oil used in compounding\r\nlubricating oils and illuminating oils is still carried on to some\r\nextent. The process consists of graining the oils in graining tanks or\r\nin seeding trucks similar to oleo oil graining trucks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pressing._--The lard cooled to a temperature of 40° F. is placed in\r\ncloth wrapper arranged so that all oil is strained through the wrapper.\r\nThe solid substance contained in the wrapper is lard stearine used to\r\nharden pure lard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.--FILTER PRESS FOR LARD OR OLEO OIL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Graining._--After the fats have been washed they should be drawn into\r\ntrucks or tierces and placed in a room where there is good ventilation,\r\nand kept there for about two days, giving the acid fumes an opportunity\r\nto pass off; the fat will then be found to be lowered to about 80°\r\nF. and should then be removed to a room that is refrigerated. After\r\nremaining in this temperature three or four days the fats will be found\r\nto be crystallized, or grained, and of about the temperature of the\r\nrooms. It is then ready to go to press.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pressing Temperatures.=--The usual pressing temperatures for the\r\nseveral kinds of commodities pressed are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Tallow            58° to 65° F.\r\n  Prime steam lard  48° to 50° F.\r\n  Neatsfoot oil     45° to 48° F.\r\n\r\nThese and the temperature of the room, however, are subject to\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=No. 2 Lard Oil.=--A lower quality of lard oil is made from hog\r\ngreases. These are made from condemned hogs, catch basin skimmings and\r\nsimilar sources. The methods are similar to those used for No. 1 lard\r\noil, except that the former is treated as an edible product and the\r\nlatter as inedible.\r\n\r\nThe extracted stearine is sold or used for soap purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cold Test-Oil.=--It is not customary to speak of any particular cold\r\ntest of cotton or grease oils; however, in case of pure lard oil,\r\npressed, it would have a cold test of about 42° F. Pure neatsfoot\r\nwould have a cold test of about 45° F. In case colder degree oils are\r\ndesired, either pure lard or neatsfoot, it would be necessary to make\r\nthe lard colder than above; as to neatsfoot oil, if it is desired to\r\nmake a 30° F. test, it would be best to make two pressings. First chill\r\nstock to a temperature of 42° F., pressing it in a room at 45° F. and\r\nthen take the oil that is made in this way, refrigerating it in a room\r\nat 32° F. and pressing it at a temperature of 32° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Treatment for Lard Grease.=--Before pressing the low grade greases it\r\nis necessary to wash with sulphuric acid to eliminate the impurities,\r\nsuch as water, lime soaps, albuminous matters and ordinary dirt.\r\nShallow wooden vats are ordinarily used for this purpose, the vats\r\nbeing of greater width than depth, as the acid water settles best in\r\na shallow receptacle. Where a comparatively small amount of work is\r\nto be done an ordinary wooden vat made out of good sound pine, with\r\nthree-inch staves and well bolted together, is all that is necessary,\r\nbut where the work is continuous these wooden vats should be lined with\r\nten-ounce lead, as the acid very soon destroys the vats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Washing Methods._--The method of washing with the sulphuric acid\r\nis as follows: Into the wooden or lead-lined vat run clear water to\r\nthe amount of about 10 to 15 per cent of the weight of the grease to\r\nbe treated, and when the water is in, add one per cent of sulphuric\r\nacid to the fat to be washed, the acid to be 66-degree density. It is\r\nimportant that the water be put in first, for if the acid is put into\r\nthe tank first and the water afterwards run in, an explosion is liable\r\nto occur on account of the intense heat generated by the absorption of\r\nthe water by the acid. In case of an explosion the acid is liable to be\r\nthrown on the attendants. After the water and acid have been mixed, add\r\ngrease, turn on steam and boil until the fat and acid show clear; at\r\nfirst it will be muddy or cloudy. Usually a boiling of twenty to thirty\r\nminutes is sufficient. This work should be done on the top floor of the\r\nbuilding, or some place where there is ample room for the escape of the\r\nvapor, as the fumes of the acid are very strong and are injurious to\r\nthe building. After the boiling is finished, allow the tank to settle\r\nten to twelve hours, draw off the acid water from the bottom, and if\r\nthe same is clear and clean it shows that the fat had little foreign\r\nsubstance and the solution can be used over again. If it shows a great\r\ndeal of foreign matter in the solution it should be run away.\r\n\r\nAll pipes leading from such treating vats should be of lead. It is also\r\nnecessary that the pipes in the vats be of perforated lead coils, as\r\niron pipes would very soon be destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Filtration._--At times, for bleaching purposes, and especially on low\r\ngrade greases, it is usual to refine and bleach the oil. The amount of\r\nfullers earth to be used in filtering depends upon the condition of\r\nthe oil to be filtered. With prime steam lard no fullers earth should\r\nbe used; it is simply filtered through clean press cloths. In the case\r\nof lard oils and tallow oils, the color of the oil desired must also\r\ndetermine the amount of fullers earth to be used, no set rule as to the\r\namount to be used in every case being practicable.\r\n\r\nEvery manufacturer of these different grades of oils has his own grades\r\nand standards established, to which the lard refiners usually work, and\r\nthe amount of bleaching, etc., which is necessary for each individual\r\nlot should be governed by the knowledge of the operator, rather than by\r\nany set rules.\r\n\r\nIn the pressing of these articles the oils generally run from 40 to 52\r\nper cent of stock, the balance being stearine, the percentage of oil\r\nobtained varying according to the temperature at which it is pressed,\r\nand according to the relative market prices for oils and stearines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nSMOKE HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\n  SMOKING MEATS -- NOMENCLATURE -- SOAKING -- SMOKING -- GAS SMOKING\r\n  -- TEMPERATURES -- TREATMENT AFTER SMOKING -- TROLLEY SYSTEM --\r\n  CANVASED MEATS -- SHRINKAGE -- WRAPPING -- WHITE WASH -- DRIED BEEF\r\n  -- PACKAGES -- SKIPPER FLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Smoking Meats.=--The smoking of meats is an ancient method of\r\npreserving for future use. In the smoking process which drys the meat\r\nand to some extent impregnates it, a preservative result is brought\r\nabout, and meats which are smoked can be carried for quite a long\r\nperiod of time without becoming unfit for food. Notably a Virginia ham.\r\nThe old style developed in Virginia was to smoke the ham for a month or\r\nsix weeks. The ham, dried to about 75 per cent of its original weight\r\nand in this form hung in a moderately dry place, would be edible at the\r\nend of twelve months.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nomenclature.=--The naming of meats has grown up among the trade\r\nand it is understood that the prefix, “bacon,” as applied to meats\r\nindicated the same to be dry salted, when smoked. Whereas, when used\r\nas a suffix it indicates a sweet pickled cure. For example, “Bacon\r\nBellies” means dry salted, smoked bellies; while “Breakfast Bacon”\r\nmeans sweet pickle cured, smoked meats.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Soaking Meats.=--Before meats are placed in the smoke house, they are\r\nsoaked in fresh water. This is done to remove the surplus salt, making\r\nthe meat more palatable; and to give it a better appearance. If it is\r\nnot properly soaked the salt forms a white crust on the surface. Meat\r\nover-soaked becomes “water-logged” and often becomes water-sour when\r\nexposed to the heat for smoking, also moulds quickly after smoking,\r\nhence it is essential that this part of the work receives careful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe best results from soaking are obtained by using soaking water at\r\na temperature of 65° F. A soaking schedule that will be found to give\r\nexcellent results is as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE TIME REQUIRED TO SOAK MEATS.\r\n\r\n  Hams at full cured age        2    hrs. (3 min. for each day older)\r\n  Bellies,  8-10 lbs., 20 days  1¹⁄₂ hrs. (3 min. for each day older)\r\n  Bellies, 10-12 lbs., 25 days  1¹⁄₂ hrs. (3 min. for each day older)\r\n  Bellies, 12-16 lbs., 30 days  1¹⁄₂ hrs. (3 min. for each day older)\r\n  Dry salt meats                 ¹⁄₂ hrs. (except bellies, two hours)\r\n\r\nIf meats still show salt after smoking change water once, as the fresh\r\nwater will take up salt rapidly. It will be found better to change\r\nwater than to soak longer. Mildly cured bacon is washed to remove salt\r\non surface, and not soaked. Thorough washing of all meats with a stiff\r\nbrush is done before hanging. “Bacon” or dry salted meat is not soaked.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Smoking.=--After the meats are washed and hung in the smoke house,\r\nthey should be allowed to dry about three hours, or until they stop\r\ndripping, for if the smoke is applied while the meats are still\r\ndripping, wherever one piece of meat is subjected to the dripping of\r\nanother, the smoke fails to take effect, giving the meats a striped and\r\ndiscolored appearance. The meat, thoroughly dry, fire should be built\r\nin the smoke house with either hickory, maple or oak wood (partially\r\ngreen being preferred) and the temperature brought up from 112° to 118°\r\nF., and maintained until the surface of the meat has become thoroughly\r\ndried and has a partially glazed appearance. As soon as this effect is\r\nnoticed, which will be in five to eight hours, hardwood sawdust should\r\nbe added, which will form a dense, penetrating smoke. At the same time\r\nthe temperature should be gradually increased in the smoke house, or\r\nbrought up to from 115° to 120° F.\r\n\r\nA pile of sawdust, quantity depending upon the size of the smoke\r\nhouse used, should be raised in the center of the house and a few\r\nburning brands of wood laid around it. These will cause the sawdust to\r\nignite and a small fire, producing a great deal of smoke, will result\r\ntherefrom. If the sawdust is put on a fire already burning much of the\r\nsawdust will go up through the house in the form of a light ash, which\r\nis deposited upon the meat, injuring its appearance.\r\n\r\nA house of sweet-pickle meats should be smoked for about twenty-four\r\nto thirty hours, to get good results, and be allowed to stand for\r\ntwelve hours with the ventilators open, to give the meat a chance to\r\nthoroughly cool off before discharging.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gas Smoking.=--The growing scarcity and consequent increased cost of\r\nwood is forcing many packers to use gas and sawdust for smoking. With\r\nthis system the use of sawdust and gas is made in combination, the\r\ngas being burned by slow delivery through a perforated pipe, and the\r\nsawdust banked nearby to burn with a creeping fire. The use of steam\r\ncoils for heating the house is a valuable assistance particularly if\r\nexhaust steam is available for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Temperatures.=--The following temperatures will be found to give very\r\nsatisfactory results in smoking and while it will be found impossible\r\nto adhere to them absolutely, it is advisable to do so as closely as\r\npossible during the smoking period:\r\n\r\n   3 hours in smoke  107° F.\r\n   6 hours in smoke  114° F.\r\n   9 hours in smoke  116° F.\r\n  12 hours in smoke  118° F.\r\n  15 hours in smoke  119° F.\r\n  18 hours in smoke  118° F.\r\n  21 hours in smoke  120° F.\r\n  24 hours in smoke  118° F.\r\n  27 hours in smoke  119° F.\r\n  30 hours in smoke  115° F.\r\n\r\nIt should be the aim to have the house at a temperature of 118° F.\r\nafter twelve hours, and it should be held at that if possible. Meats\r\nthus handled will be found to have a light amber color which indicates\r\na light smoke, whereas a dark amber would indicate a heavy smoke. The\r\ncolor of the meats should be regulated by the requirements of the\r\ntrade. Lighter meats, such as fancy bacon, should be hung on the upper\r\nfloors with the hams nearer the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Treatment After Smoking.=--When meats are finished smoking the fire\r\nshould be put out, the house opened up, giving it a free circulation\r\nof air, and the meats allowed to thoroughly dry and cool before being\r\nremoved. Smoked meats should be handled as little as possible, for\r\nevery time they are handled or piled on trucks, it detracts from their\r\nappearance. They become greasy and soon lose their bright, attractive\r\nappearance. After being cooled, the meat should not be handled until\r\ninspected and packed for shipment, thereby preserving a very desirable\r\nappearance, as well as reducing the cost of labor in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trolley System.=--Originally meats were hung from nails in beams or\r\nfrom cross sticks suspended from beams, the smoke house being an open\r\nshaft. Many devices have been originated for saving time in taking\r\nmeats in and out of smoke, and various forms of racks operated on\r\noverhead rails have been devised. Some sort of arrangement of this kind\r\nis a necessity.\r\n\r\nA trolley storage space is usually arranged near to the packing\r\nspace and meats packed direct from the trolley. It is usual to make\r\na complete inspection out of smoke and pass the hams to the storage\r\ntrolley, graded, wiped and ready for packing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canvased Meats from Weight.=--Canvased meats are usually sold on\r\npacked weight, cloth included. The gain in weight usually pays for all\r\ncost involved and somewhat better, as the test below indicates:\r\n\r\nCANVASING 1,031 HAMS.\r\n\r\n  325    yards sheeting at 4⁷⁄₈c                    $15.84\r\n    3³⁄₄ yards Andover twine at 30c                   1.12\r\n  274    yards paper at 1³⁄₄c                         4.32\r\n  One man three hours at 17¹⁄₂c per hour               .52\r\n  Sewing at $1.10                                   11.34\r\n                                                    ------\r\n    Cost of canvasing                                        $33.14\r\n\r\n    445 pounds wash at 2.1c                         $ 9.34\r\n  1,031 labels at $1 per 1,000                        1.03\r\n  Eight men two hours twenty-eight min., seven men\r\n  thirty-five min.                                    4.11   $14.48\r\n                                                    ---------------\r\n    Total actual cost                                        $47.62\r\n\r\n  Weight before canvasing  10,550 lbs.\r\n  Weight after canvasing   11,041 lbs.\r\n  Weight after washing     11,486 lbs.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted from the previous test that there was a gain of 936\r\npounds in canvasing these hams, at a cost of $5.09 per 100 pounds. As\r\nhams always sell at a much higher price than this, the difference would\r\nrepresent the profit in this operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shrinkage.=--Shrinkage of smoked meats is a matter tangible in dollars\r\nand cents. Meats for prompt consumption, such as those smoked and\r\ndistributed from a branch house, can be smoked for less than meats\r\nsmoked at the parent house for shipment via carload or local freight.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to smoke out the meat as near green weights as possible, the\r\namount of shrinkage depending largely upon the requirements at points\r\nto which meats are to be shipped and the conditions to which they are\r\nto be subjected. For instance, hams and shoulders which are to be used\r\nfor immediate consumption should smoke out 98¹⁄₂ to 100 per cent green\r\nweight, whereas meats which are to be held for some length of time\r\nafter being smoked, or which are intended for a warmer climate, will\r\nsmoke out from 95 to 97 per cent of the green weight.\r\n\r\nMeats, which are to be consumed immediately and not shipped to a warm\r\nclimate, may carry more moisture and hence show less shrinkage. At\r\nthe same time they have a much finer and more attractive appearance.\r\nThis is a matter to which an owner or manager of a smoke house must\r\nnecessarily give minute and close attention in order to obtain the best\r\nresults. Perhaps as important a point as any, is when the condition of\r\nthe meats as to dryness is concerned. Meats should be shipped promptly\r\nwhen in condition and not allowed to remain in the smoke house awaiting\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the result of tests on 1,136 pounds of meat\r\nhung in smoke house for seven consecutive days, temperature of smoke\r\nhouse about 90° F.\r\n\r\n                             Lbs.\r\n  Weight when fully smoked  1,136\r\n  24 hours later            1,129\r\n  24 hours later            1,121\r\n  24 hours later            1,114\r\n  24 hours later            1,108\r\n  24 hours later            1,105\r\n  24 hours later            1,100\r\n\r\n  Thirty-six pounds shrinkage in seven days’ hanging.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wrapping Smoked Meats.=--Fancy meats, now almost entirely distributed\r\nin wrappers of paper or cloth, should be well cooled before wrapping.\r\nA piece of cheese cloth is wrapped over the butt, and absorptive paper\r\nfolded next, usually doubled at the butt, with an outer covering of\r\nparchment paper. The neatness and appearance of the package must be\r\nconsidered and naturally the package should be kept clean.\r\n\r\nFor some trade, meats are sewn in burlap. Others are covered with\r\nwhitewash solution, or yellow wash. Meats put out in such manner are\r\nusually intended for distant shipment and should be harder smoked.\r\nCanvassed or white-washed meats are paper wrapped, same as fancy meats,\r\nbefore covering with the outer bag.\r\n\r\n\r\n=White-Wash.=--The following recipe can be used for making white-wash:\r\n\r\n  1,200 pounds floated barytes.\r\n     90 pounds flour.\r\n    140 pounds water.\r\n     63 pounds white ham wash glue.\r\n      1 teaspoon blueing.\r\n\r\nThe glue should be cooked and strained through a piece of cloth before\r\nbeing added to the solution, as there is liable to be more or less\r\nsediment in the glue, which should be removed, after which mix with the\r\nflour; let stand about twelve hours, then add the barytes, using hot\r\nwater in mixing. After it is mixed add the blueing.\r\n\r\nThis material should be put in a tub, held at a temperature of 90°\r\nto 100° F., into which the canvassed meats are to be immersed. After\r\nbeing dipped they are hung up over the tub while an attendant rubs his\r\nhand over them, taking off the surplus material which has adhered to\r\nthe package, and at the same time forcing the wash into the openings\r\nof the cloth. They should next be brushed over with a heavy paint\r\nbrush, smoothing off the surface, and then hung in a dry-room to dry.\r\nAfter being allowed to hang for eight to ten hours, until the wash is\r\nthoroughly dry and has hardened, they are ready for shipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yellow Wash for Meat Canvas.=--This is practically the same as white\r\nwash, except that a chrome yellow color is used, and the mixture will\r\nhave a yellow instead of a white shade when finished. Handle same as\r\nwhite wash for meats. A formula for yellow wash is given as follows:\r\n\r\n  1,200 pounds floated barytes.\r\n    210 pounds whiting.\r\n    195 pounds water.\r\n    114 pounds lemon yellow.\r\n     35 pounds joiner’s glue.\r\n\r\nThis is used at a temperature of from 90° to 100° F. As all meats\r\ncanvassed are sold gross weight, the barytes is added to give an\r\nadditional weight to the meats which are canvassed.\r\n\r\nA dry room in which meats can be dried by forced draft from fan is a\r\nvaluable adjunct for quick deliveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Smoking Dried Beef.=--Dried beef is an article which has to be smoked\r\nheavier, dried more, than pork hams, and unless the moisture is well\r\nevaporated the time it may be kept will be short. An approved method\r\nfor handling dried beef is as follows:\r\n\r\nSteam coils should be placed at the top and also at the bottom of\r\nthe smoke house. The steam should be turned on until the temperature\r\nof house is between 130° and 140° F. After the meat has hung in this\r\ntemperature about thirty hours, a light fire should be started, by\r\nusing two or three sticks of wood, and plenty of hard wood sawdust\r\nscattered close to the fire, so as to form a dense smoke. It is very\r\nessential that dried beef should have a strong smoked flavor. Steam\r\nshould be kept on the house all the time the beef is being smoked and\r\nit will require eighty to ninety hours under these conditions to bring\r\nthe beef out in the best condition.\r\n\r\nBeef can be smoked in a regular house, but it takes much longer and it\r\ncannot be handled as satisfactorily as with steam heat in connection\r\nwith the smoking process.\r\n\r\nAfter the meat is sufficiently smoked the house should be allowed to\r\ncool off, and the meat to hang for about twenty-four hours before being\r\nhandled. It is then ready for packing and shipping. Dried beef thus\r\nhandled will shrink about 38 to 33 per cent from the cured weight to\r\nthe smoked weight.\r\n\r\nThe following test will show the shrinkage on 100 pieces of dried beef\r\nhams, also the shrinkage each twenty-four hours after:\r\n\r\nSHRINKAGE ON DRIED BEEF.\r\n\r\n  100 pieces, cellar weight  1,184 lbs.\r\n  After smoking 85 hours       812 lbs.\r\n  24 hours later               806 lbs.\r\n  24 hours later               793 lbs.\r\n  24 hours later               781 lbs.\r\n  24 hours later               762 lbs.\r\n  24 hours later               755 lbs.\r\n  24 hours later               750 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Packages.=--The packing of meats for shipment is best done in open\r\ntype barrels or crates. Fancy meats should not be packed to exceed one\r\nhundred pounds per box so as not to injure the shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Skipper Fly.=--The skipper, the larvae in the life cycle of a fly is\r\nthe one pest needing close watching in a smoke house. This fly does not\r\nattack either green or salted meats, but will select a piece of pork\r\nham in preference to a beef ham. The fly lays an egg which hatches to\r\na larvae, and this is the disgusting form in which it is the enemy of\r\nsweet-smoked meats.\r\n\r\nThe preventive seems to be such as windows and doors finely screened,\r\nregular “gassing” with sulphur fumes and ample light. It is claimed\r\nby some that if smoke houses are well lighted, for instance as a show\r\nroom, the skipper fly will not frequent them since it prefers darkness\r\nfor the egg laying period.\r\n\r\nThere is no known chemical agent that can be used without conflicting\r\nwith pure food laws that will destroy the egg once deposited. A fly\r\nlays upward of thirty eggs during the life cycle of about two weeks,\r\nconsequently it multiplies rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC SAUSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n  MEATS AND HANDLING -- ARRANGEMENT OF DEPARTMENT -- CURING MEATS --\r\n  COOLER FOR GROUND MEATS -- GRINDING AND STUFFING ROOM -- SMOKE HOUSE\r\n  -- COOK ROOM -- DRY HANGING ROOM -- COOLER -- SMOKING TEMPERATURE\r\n  -- COOKING TIME -- SHRINKAGES -- PICKLE-CURED PRODUCTS -- DRY-CURED\r\n  MEATS -- PACKING -- CASINGS AND SPICES -- SAUSAGE CEREALS -- SAUSAGE\r\n  FORMULAS -- BOLOGNA VARNISH -- BOILED HAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Introductory.=--There is probably no department where there is\r\nmore diversity of methods than in the sausage room. The business of\r\nsausage making is an old one, and was largely developed in Europe,\r\nwhere on account of the low wages and the high prices for meats it was\r\nnecessary to make the cheaper meat products into an edible article. The\r\ngradually increasing value of meats in the United States makes the same\r\nconditions paramount.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of packing houses the cutting of meats into many\r\nparts so as to supply the various purchasers with what they require,\r\nmakes a comparatively large amount of wholesome meat product, equally\r\nnutritious with porter house steak, but not quite so tender or pleasing\r\nto the taste. Cheek meat, hearts and various trimmings are wholesome\r\nas a porterhouse, but not so delectable, at least, in their original\r\ncondition; hence, the art of sausage making consists in taking these\r\nproducts and making from them a palatable, wholesome and less costly\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Meats and Handling.=--Sausage is made in such varieties that there\r\nare a multitude of ingredients in a multitude of forms. Primarily\r\nbeef and pork trimmings are the broad classes, but of these there\r\nare many forms, each of different physical properties. Hearts and\r\ncheeks are, for example, the toughest part of the animal organism,\r\nand these usually find their way to the sausage room. On the other\r\nhand the parts of hams and shoulders used are equally delicate with\r\nthe meats so conserved, but are of necessity relegated to the sausage\r\nroom on account of their shape as a trimming. It is the skillful\r\nmanipulation of these various meats that makes for the real results in\r\nthis department. Too frequently, the sausage department is regarded\r\nas a necessity, like the tank house, to put things through. The most\r\nsuccessful operators are those who regard the department otherwise, and\r\nmany good and successful businesses have been builded on the sausage\r\ndepartment as a basis; not by trying to make sausage to retail at five\r\ncents per pound, extravagantly speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Arrangement of Department.=--This department becomes quite\r\ncomprehensive in its scope in large establishments requiring:\r\n\r\n  Refrigerated space for curing fresh meats.\r\n\r\n  Cooler for curing meats after ground.\r\n\r\n  Grinding and stuffing room.\r\n\r\n  Smoke houses.\r\n\r\n  Cook room.\r\n\r\n  Dry hanging room for smoked sausage.\r\n\r\n  Cooler for sausage other than smoked sausage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Curing Meats.=--In certain sausages cured meats are a necessity, in\r\nothers they can be used without detriment, while there still remain\r\nothers in which cured meats are positively bad. Therefore exactly how\r\nto handle the meats so as to have them available for use in proper\r\nform becomes a matter of concern. Formerly when preservatives, like\r\nborax and boracic acid could be used, many products were put into cure\r\nwith a preservative of saltpetre, borax, boracic acid, sugar and salt,\r\nand kept sufficiently mild to be acceptable, but the pure food laws\r\nabolishing the use of preservatives have changed conditions. The result\r\nis that sausage products should be cured like hams and frozen when\r\ncured or frozen before curing and carried in this form until wanted.\r\nHowever, quite a large space should be provided near the sausage\r\ndepartment for curing products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooler for Ground Meats.=--In close proximity to the sausage room\r\nis provided a shelving room arranged for placing ground fresh spiced\r\nmeats for curing processes; spiced completely and ready for stuffing.\r\nMeats can be held in this manner and stuffed, smoked, cooked and packed\r\nrapidly as the exigencies of shipping demand. This enables the maker to\r\nshorten the time between himself and the consumer, most necessary for a\r\nsuccessful business.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grinding and Stuffing Room.=--This should be a well lighted and well\r\nventilated room. Here the grinding equipment and stuffing tables are\r\nlocated. The principal equipment needed are “Enterprise” type grinders,\r\nsilent cutters, mixer and back fat choppers, with a spice mill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.--DEVICE FOR RUNNING SAUSAGE INTO SMOKE HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nMechanical cutters are expected to be an aid to teeth and therefore\r\nthey should be made to perform their part by being fitted with sharp\r\nknives to do the cutting. Choppers are only necessary in making\r\nsummer sausage although some manufacturers prefer to rock their fancy\r\nbreakfast sausage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Smoke Houses.=--The management of sausage smoke houses for ordinary\r\nsausage vary considerably. Figs. 159 and 160 with description\r\nillustrate one of the sliding carriage types. The smoke house carriage\r\nis made of angle irons and is run on a track which is supported by\r\nvertical columns. The outside tracks can be raised to any height\r\ndesired to match the tracks in the smoke house. The sausage is hung on\r\nthis carriage and run into the smoke house, and when it is sufficiently\r\nsmoked the carriage can be drawn out on the movable rails, the\r\nsausages taken off, others put in their place and the operation\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nThis device necessitates a carriage for each set of tracks in the\r\nsmoke house. Later practice tends toward the use of some sort of\r\ncage--operated from overhead rails; the sausage department being\r\narranged with rails near to the stuffing tables. Extending to the\r\nsmoke houses, thence to the cook boxes and on to the hanging rooms.\r\nThis arrangement is so familiar that it does not require further\r\ndescription. The tracks are made in such form and size as to fit the\r\nhouses and usually conform to one of the types illustrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.--DETAIL OF SMOKE HOUSE CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe modern houses are built of brick, about 54 inches in width, which\r\nwill allow, clear of the frame, two to four inches. In depth the houses\r\nvary and can be from ten to sixteen feet. Where possible, they should\r\nbe built on a corresponding level to the cook rooms and grinding rooms,\r\nso as to avoid the necessity of using elevators. This brings the fire\r\npit within a reasonable distance, which is a decided advantage for high\r\ntemperature smoke houses.\r\n\r\nSmoke house compartments for summer or dried sausage can be from two to\r\nthree stories and should be built exclusively of brick, as it has been\r\nshown by numerous experiments with sheet iron and iron lined houses\r\nthat these are not a success for smoking all kinds of sausage. The\r\ndraft of the house is, of course, regulated by ventilators at the top.\r\n\r\nBetter results are obtained by the use of tin clad wood center doors\r\nthan by the use of plate iron doors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.--DIAGRAM SMOKE HOUSE SAUSAGE STACK.]\r\n\r\nIn smoking domestic sausage, it is always preferable to use hard wood,\r\nnever to put green or unsmoked sausage into a cold smoke house, the\r\nhouse should be warmed by first building a fire in it, in case it has\r\nnot been recently used. In hot weather or in the summer time this is\r\nnot so important, as smoke houses then are sufficiently warm at all\r\ntimes. In cool weather or during the winter, the smoke house should\r\neither be kept warm by constant usage or by warming up before using in\r\ncase the house is empty and has become cold. The fire should not be\r\nover eight feet from the cage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooking Time.=--To successfully manufacture sausage it should be\r\ncooked properly. The following schedule gives the time and temperature\r\nof cooking different kinds of sausage, forming the “Cooking Schedule”\r\nreferred to in many of the foregoing formulas:\r\n\r\nCOOKING SCHEDULE FOR SAUSAGE.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-----+-------+-----------\r\n                       | ... |  ...  |Temperature\r\n                       | Time| Time  |  degrees\r\n     Kind of sausage   |hours|minutes| Fahrenheit\r\n  ---------------------+-----+-------+-----------\r\n  Long Bologna         | ... |   30  |   160\r\n  Large Bologna        |  2  |  ...  |   160\r\n  Round Bologna        | ... |   20  |   155\r\n  Bag Bologna          |  2  |  ...  |   160\r\n  Bologna in weasands  | ... |   45  |   155\r\n  Knoblauch            | ... |   20  |   160\r\n  Leona Bologna long   | ... |   40  |   155\r\n  Leona Bologna large  |  2  |  ...  |   160\r\n  Regular Frankfurts   | ... |    7  |   160\r\n  Vienna Frankfurts    | ... |    7  |   160\r\n  High grade Frankfurts| ... |    7  |   160\r\n  Blood                |  2  |  ...  |   200\r\n  Tongue               |  2  |  ...  |   200\r\n  Liver                | ... |   30  |   160\r\n  Minced ham           |  4  |  ...  |   150\r\n  Berlin ham           |  2  |  ...  |   170\r\n  Head cheese          | ... |   45  |   180\r\n  Cooked pressed ham   |  2  |   30  |   180\r\n  ---------------------+-----+-------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cook Room.=--The cook room should be provided with vats of various\r\ntypes, usually of iron plate on account of ease in cleaning. A later\r\ntype is provided with a hood, the apparatus looks like a piano box, a\r\nlifting cover being provided which permits it to be raised and lowered\r\nat will. Permanent ventilating spouts are attached to the top to\r\ndispose of the steam--something that must be contended with in the cook\r\nroom. The vats are usually arranged in pairs and are accessible from\r\nthree sides.\r\n\r\nIn some large institutions cook tanks are set in the floor and the\r\nsausage cage submerged with the sausage hanging thereon. This is not\r\nadvisable as there is sure to be a discoloration from the cages.\r\n\r\nSausage upon removal from the cook tanks should be drenched with cold\r\nwater, preferably sprayed on from the top. This washes the sausage and\r\ncools it, preparatory to hanging in the sales or packing department.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Smoking Temperatures.=--The smoking of sausage is a very important\r\nfactor, and in the different formulas given in the instructions for\r\nhandling, reference has been made to the “Smoking Schedule.” This\r\nschedule has been carefully compiled and the time and temperatures\r\ngiven should be closely followed in order to get the best results.\r\n\r\nSMOKING TEMPERATURES FOR SAUSAGE.\r\n\r\n  =====================+============+===========\r\n                       |            |Temperature\r\n                       |     Time   |  degrees\r\n     Kind of sausage   |    hours   | Fahrenheit\r\n  ---------------------+------------+-----------\r\n  Long Bologna         |      3     | 145 to 150\r\n  Large Bologna        |      3     | 145 to 150\r\n  Round Bologna        |      2     | 135 to 140\r\n  Bag Bologna          |      1     | 140 to 145\r\n  Bologna in weasands  |      4     | 185\r\n  Knoblauch            |      1¹⁄₂  | 130\r\n  Leona Bologna long   |      3     | 145\r\n  Leona Bologna large  |      3     | 145\r\n  Regular Frankfurts   |2¹⁄₂ to 3   | 130 to 135\r\n  Vienna Frankfurts    |      3     | 140 to 145\r\n  High grade Frankfurts|3    to 3¹⁄₂| 150 to 160\r\n  Blood                |     12     |  65 to 70\r\n  Tongue               |     12     |  65 to 70\r\n  Liver                |1    to 1¹⁄₂| 110 to 120\r\n  Polish               |3    to 3¹⁄₂| 150 to 160\r\n  Minced ham           |3    to 3¹⁄₂| 135\r\n  Berlin               |      5     | 130 to 140\r\n  Cooked pressed ham   |      5     | 130 to 140\r\n  Cottage ham          |     32     | 120\r\n  Boneless ham         |     48     |  80\r\n  ---------------------+------------+-----------\r\n\r\nA thermometer in a smoke house is a necessity--not an ornament. A clock\r\nis of the same consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dry Hanging Room.=--A well ventilated room with all the light possible\r\nshould be provided for storage of smoked sausage awaiting shipment.\r\nThis should not be a cooler. Sixty degree Fahr. is amply low, and in\r\nsummer a higher temperature is advisable. If smoked sausage is placed\r\nin a cooler it condenses moisture on the surface and becomes slimy,\r\nmouldy and rotten in rapid succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shrinkages of Domestic Sausage.=--As is known to all sausage makers\r\nit is in very rare cases that 100 pounds of meat makes 100 pounds of\r\nfinished sausage; there is always a shrinkage and before the cost of\r\nthe finished sausage can be determined one must know the shrinkage from\r\noriginal weights of raw materials.\r\n\r\nThe following tabulated statement is compiled from experience with\r\nvery large amounts of the different kinds of sausage, extended over a\r\nyear and a half of actual manufacture. The mean average of shrinkage\r\nis accurate information and may safely be used as a guide. The cost\r\nof the formulas is not given as there is such a variation in prices\r\nof ingredients induced by market prices that any figures would be\r\nmisleading. To find out the cost of the formulas, figure the given\r\nweights at market value, shrinking them according to the table below,\r\nadding cost for labor and supplies, and a very close approximate cost\r\nof the manufactured article will be obtained.\r\n\r\n                            Per cent\r\n                               of\r\n    Kind of Sausage.

Dryness\r\nin this cooler is a first and prime essential. Likewise a spreading\r\nof the product so as to give it opportunity to dry. Moisture in\r\nthis department creates a bad condition in the product. Fans are an\r\nassistance in that they produce a circulation which adds to dryness.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pickle-Cured Product.=--The following products are used in sausage\r\nmaking. They are of little value except in the cured condition:\r\n\r\n  Pork snouts,\r\n  Pork hearts,\r\n  Pork cheeks,\r\n  Pork skins,\r\n  Pork heads,\r\n  Pork hocks,\r\n  Pork ears,\r\n  Pork tails,\r\n  Beef hearts,\r\n  Beef cheeks,\r\n  Ox lips,\r\n  Sheep hearts.\r\n\r\nThese products should be thoroughly chilled by spreading them out on\r\nracks and placing them in a chill room having a temperature of from\r\n34° to 36° F. They should be turned while being chilled. After being\r\nthoroughly chilled for from twenty-four to thirty-six hours, they\r\nshould be put into vats or tierces with an eighty-degree plain pickle,\r\nusing eight ounces of saltpetre to the one-hundred pounds of meat.\r\n\r\nA wooden frame and weight is placed on the product in order to keep it\r\nimmersed in the pickle. To cure these meats in vats use the following\r\nquantities of pickle:\r\n\r\n  1,400 pounds of meat will require 54 gallons of pickle.\r\n  1,000 pounds of meat will require 42 gallons of pickle.\r\n    800 pounds of meat will require 36 gallons of pickle.\r\n\r\nThe meats should be kept in a cellar during the pickling process,\r\nwith the temperature ranging from 38° to 40° F., and overhauled every\r\nfive, ten and fifteen days in order that all the pickle may thoroughly\r\npenetrate the meats. The different kinds of meats will be found to be\r\nsufficiently cured after being in pickle the following number of days:\r\n\r\n  Pork snouts   25 to 30 days\r\n  Pork hearts   25 to 30 days\r\n  Pork cheeks   25 to 30 days\r\n  Pork skins    10 to 15 days\r\n  Pork heads          35 days\r\n  Pork ears           10 days\r\n  Pork hocks          25 days\r\n  Pork tails          10 days\r\n  Beef hearts   25 to 30 days\r\n  Beef cheeks   25 to 30 days\r\n  Ox lips             20 days\r\n  Sheep hearts  25 to 30 days\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dry Cured Meats.=--For some classes of sausage dry-cured meats are\r\nused. This consists of a process of curing meat in tierces, the meat\r\npacked closely and curing product interspersed. For this product a\r\nformula made from the following serves. For one tierce of 400 pounds\r\nuse the following mixture:\r\n\r\n  16    pounds salt,\r\n   4    pounds sugar,\r\n   1¹⁄₂ pounds saltpetre,\r\n   2    quarts old ham pickle, which must be sweet and in good\r\n        condition.\r\n\r\nPork and beef trimmings should be fresh, and if they have been packed\r\nin barrels for transport the blood should be allowed to drain off\r\nbefore being packed in the preservative. They should not be washed in\r\npickle before being used, but should be handled dry. The two quarts\r\nof old ham pickle mentioned in the above formula should be sprinkled\r\nthrough as uniformly as possible when pounding the trimmings down into\r\nthe tierce.\r\n\r\nIf packing fresh beef and pork hearts, head meat, beef and pork cheek\r\nmeat, giblet and weasand meat, they should be thoroughly washed in a\r\nmild pickle so as to remove the blood and slime before packing in the\r\ntierce. Head, cheek, and giblet meat should not be put into ice water\r\nwhen cut off on the killing floor, but should be promptly removed to a\r\ncooler where the temperature is 33° to 36° F., and spread or hung up on\r\nracks to refrigerate.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken not to allow these meats to accumulate in any bulk\r\nwhile warm. Hearts and large pieces should be split to reduce their\r\nsize and make accessible to the curing ingredient. In the packing of\r\nthese meats the pickle used with dry trimming is omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Packing.=--After the trimmings are properly prepared they are to be\r\nmixed with the curing ingredients. This is best accomplished by the\r\nuse of a tumbler churn, weighing a given amount of the trimmings and\r\nplacing with the allotted proportion of curing materials into the churn.\r\n\r\nWhen mixed with the preservative, the trimmings should be put in a\r\ntierce, in layers, and pounded down as tightly as possible with a\r\nmaul, and the operation continued until the tierce is as full as\r\npossible, allowing for the head to be put on. Before heading up spread\r\na cheese cloth or thin cotton cloth over the top to protect the\r\ntrimmings from the head. The tierce when headed up is removed to cold\r\nstorage, where the temperature must be kept as near 38° F. as possible\r\nfrom thirty to forty-five days, when the trimmings are ready for use.\r\nIf it is desired to keep the product sixty days, after it has been in\r\nthe temperature above mentioned for thirty to forty-five days, remove\r\nto a lower temperature, 32° to 34° F.; and for more than sixty days to\r\na temperature of 20° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Casings and Spices.=--All classes of beef casings, namely, rounds,\r\nbungs, middles and weasands, as well as hog bungs, hog casings and\r\nsheep casings are used in the Sausage Department. There is perhaps\r\nmore chicanery used in Sausage Room supplies than in any other one\r\ndepartment, consequently care in purchase of these supplies is worthy\r\nof attention. In sheep casings it is a matter of grading as to width,\r\npieces and yardage per bundle; in hog casings, a matter of salt per\r\npound purchased, and grading as to width and pieces; in rounds and\r\nmiddles one of holes, pieces and measurement per set.\r\n\r\nSpices should so far as possible be bought in the natural state and\r\nmixed on the premises. Pure Food laws pretty well take care of the\r\npurity of the spice in most states.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sausage Cereals.=--This is a very important factor in the manufacture\r\nof sausage. The province of “fillers” is to absorb water, preventing\r\nshrinkage, and while this is advisable to an extent, if overdone, it\r\ndetracts from the quality of the product. The main base ingredients for\r\nfillers are rice flour, corn flour and potato flour. There are many\r\nsausage fillers on the market but the foregoing ingredients are most\r\nfrequently used.\r\n\r\nPotato flour or starch is not used to any extent today, manufacturers\r\nfinding that there is a great deal of trouble attached to the\r\nmanufacture of sausage containing these ingredients, on account of the\r\nliability to sour and spoil. Corn flour is the best filler that can be\r\nused, being less liable to ferment, while it absorbs the water quickly.\r\nWhile fillers are used to a great extent, the sausage manufacturer\r\nshould remember that the quality of sausage is deteriorated\r\nproportionately to the amount of water that is worked in. Hence fillers\r\nshould be used with discretion, and manufacturers who aim to make a\r\nname for their goods, are frugal with fillers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sausage Formulas.=--The following methods are tried and used for the\r\nmanufacture of various kinds of sausage. Sausage makers vary procedure\r\naccording to stocks on hand. However, for uniformity, it is best to\r\nconform to a standard so far as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pork Sausage._--This is produced in various grades, from a fancy\r\nbreakfast quality to a substance whose chief claim to the name is the\r\nform. A good pork sausage can be made as follows:\r\n\r\n  100 lb. pork trimmings, preferably shoulder trimmings, about one-third\r\n      fat.\r\n    3 pounds salt.\r\n    8 ounces pepper.\r\n    3 ounces sage.\r\n   ¹⁄₄ ounce ginger.\r\n   ¹⁄₂ ounce mace.\r\n\r\nThis should be chopped by passing through a ⁵⁄₃₂ “Enterprise” plate.\r\nMix in an arm type mixer, rather than the blade type. Mix as little\r\nas possible but sufficiently to get spice evenly distributed; stuff\r\nin medium sheep casing, 5 inch links. The matter of spicing is one of\r\ntaste and can be varied. Note the absence of water and filler in the\r\nformula.\r\n\r\nSome makers prefer to “rock” their fancy breakfast sausage. This\r\nproduces good results but is unnecessary. It is possible to use many\r\nmeats in the making of this sausage and still have it passably good,\r\nbut generally speaking, there is less chance for manipulation of this\r\nsort in this kind of sausage than in many of the others. The following\r\nformulas make a cheap and palatable pork sausage:\r\n\r\nFORMULA A.\r\n\r\n  75 pounds pork trimmings,\r\n  25 pounds tripe,\r\n   8 pounds water,\r\n   3 pounds salt,\r\n   4 ounces sage,\r\n  10 ounces white pepper,\r\n   3 ounces saltpetre,\r\n  10 pounds corn flour.\r\n\r\nFORMULA B.\r\n\r\n  90 pounds regular pork trimmings,\r\n  10 pounds tripe,\r\n   6 pounds corn flour,\r\n  10 pounds water,\r\n   2 pounds, 8 ounces salt,\r\n   4 ounces sage,\r\n  10 ounces white pepper,\r\n   3 ounces sugar,\r\n   1 pound, 8 ounces color water.\r\n\r\nThe preceding formulas are for sausage meat, often sold loose or\r\nwithout stuffing, also for sausage stuffed in hog casings. Stuff in\r\nmedium or narrow hog casings. “Tripe” is the source of refuge to\r\nproduce cheap pork sausage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bologna Style._--This is one of the most common and generally used\r\ntype of sausage manufactured. It is in demand in nearly every locality.\r\nIn the manufacture of Bologna, ingredients are used which are not\r\nin themselves palatable, but are nutritious. The seasoning makes it\r\npalatable.\r\n\r\nThe formulas which are given below, if they are accurately followed and\r\nfresh and wholesome material carefully prepared is used, will make a\r\nsausage which is very acceptable to the consumer. This is the product\r\nthat is usually made from the tougher meats such as cheeks and hearts.\r\nFor a good bologna use:\r\n\r\n  25 pounds beef trimmings,\r\n  50 pounds pork cheeks,\r\n   7 pounds corn flour,\r\n   1¹⁄₈ pounds pepper,\r\n   4 ounces coriander,\r\n  70 pounds pork trimmings,\r\n  30 pounds beef cheeks,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   2 ounces allspice,\r\n   4 ounces saltpetre,\r\n  25 pounds water.\r\n\r\nA cheaper product can be made as follows:\r\n\r\n  45 pounds hearts (pork),\r\n  20 pounds sheep cheek meat,\r\n  65 pounds beef cheeks,\r\n   7 pounds corn flour,\r\n   4 ounces coriander (ground),\r\n   4 ounces saltpetre (ground),\r\n  20 pounds pork cellar fat trimmings,\r\n  25 pounds weasand meat,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n  18 ounces pepper (ground),\r\n   2 ounces allspice (ground),\r\n  25 pounds water.\r\n\r\nTo manufacture, the product should be passed through an “Enterprise”\r\ntype of grinder, using ⁷⁄₆₄th plate. Transfer to silent cutter and\r\nchop for full five minutes, adding spice and water as the mixture\r\nis cut and turned. Transfer to shelving room and allow to lay for\r\ntwenty-four hours. Stuff in casings as required, put in smoke house at\r\na temperature of 120° F. for one and one-half hours, raise temperature\r\nto 135° F. and carry for another one and one-half hours. Cook in water\r\nat 155° F. for thirty minutes; rinse with hot water after removal, then\r\nchill with cold water and hang in shipping room.\r\n\r\nThe length of cooking and smoking varies with the weight and thickness\r\nof the package. See schedule. This recipe is for wide middle casings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frankfurt Style._--This popular sausage is made from a variety of\r\nformulas. Perhaps there is no one piece of sausage as susceptible of\r\nbeing made so excellent or so tasteless, it being entirely a matter of\r\nwhat it is made from. The better grades are made from freshly killed\r\nbull beef, hashed warm. The process consists in boning bull beef and\r\nopening the meats along the seams, so to speak, skinning each bundle\r\nof muscle to remove the wrapping and cutting out all ligaments. Fresh\r\npork, preferably, shoulder meat is treated in the same manner. The\r\nmeats are then passed through a ⁷⁄₆₄ “Enterprise” plate, and passed to\r\na silent cutter. Here cracked ice is added in quantity and the meats\r\ncut until they are a light fluffy pulp. The spices are added during\r\nthe last five minutes of cutting, and the whole mass transferred to a\r\nshelving room for twenty-four hours, when it is ready to stuff, smoke,\r\ncook, cool and sell. Wide sheep casings are used for stuffing. Make the\r\nlinks uniform. The proportions of meat used should be as follows:\r\n\r\n  60 pounds bull beef,\r\n  40 pounds pork shoulder (fat),\r\n  35 pounds ice,\r\n  10 pounds corn flour,\r\n   4 pounds salt,\r\n  12 ounces pepper,\r\n   3 ounces saltpetre,\r\n   3 ounces mace,\r\n   6 ounces sugar.\r\n\r\nThe following formulas are for less costly products and provide a means\r\nfor disposing of some by-products:\r\n\r\nFORMULA NO. 1.\r\n\r\n  57 pounds regular pork trimmings,\r\n  65 pounds beef cheek meat,\r\n  15 pounds cooked tripe,\r\n  25 pounds pork kidneys,\r\n  20 pounds dry salt or pickled pork trimmings,\r\n   9 pounds corn flour,\r\n  45 pounds water,\r\n   1 pound, 4 ounces white pepper,\r\n   3 pounds salt,\r\n   2 pounds color water,\r\n   4 ounces saltpetre,\r\n   3 ounces allspice,\r\n   3 ounces mace,\r\n   3 ounces coriander,\r\n   1¹⁄₂ ounces cloves.\r\n\r\nFORMULA NO. 2.\r\n\r\n  90 pounds lean pork cheek meat,\r\n  60 pounds regular pork trimmings,\r\n   9 pounds corn flour,\r\n  60 pounds water,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   2 pounds, 7 ounces color water,\r\n  12 ounces sugar,\r\n   3 ounces saltpetre,\r\n   1 pound black pepper,\r\n   2 ounces mace.\r\n\r\nThe use of a mixer is unnecessary with this sausage since the silent\r\ncutter will perform this work. It should take about ten minutes to do\r\nthe cutting. Smoke at 110° F. for one and one-half hours, then at 135°\r\nF. for one hour. Cook at 155° F. for eight to ten minutes, rinse and\r\ncool.\r\n\r\nIn medium and low priced frankfurts, cattle lights are used in moderate\r\nproportion, say, 10 per cent. Tripe can also be used in increased\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leona Style Sausage._--The following formula will be found acceptable\r\nfor this variety of sausage:\r\n\r\n  30 pounds pork knuckle meat,\r\n  65 pounds lean pork trimmings,\r\n  50 pounds back fat trimmings or moderately fat trimmings,\r\n  22 pounds pork neck fat,\r\n   8¹⁄₂ pounds corn flour,\r\n  55 pounds water,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   1 pound white pepper,\r\n   3 ounces mace,\r\n   2¹⁄₂ ounces saltpetre,\r\n  12 ounces sugar,\r\n   2 ounces grated onions,\r\n  ¹⁄₂ ounce garlic.\r\n\r\nKnuckle meat to be ground through a moderately fine plate. Balance of\r\npork should be chopped in the “silent cutter.” Corn flour and seasoning\r\nshould be added to the knuckle meat after it is put into the Buffalo\r\nchopper and the machine has made two or three revolutions. Chop for\r\nfour minutes, stuff in eighteen-inch pieces, beef middle casings or\r\nbeef bung casings. Smoke, cook as per schedule. Cool and send to\r\nhanging room.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Knoblauch Style Sausage._--Following are two formulas for Knoblauch\r\nsausage:\r\n\r\n  30 pounds pork knuckle meat,\r\n  65 pounds very lean pork trimmings,\r\n  50 pounds back fat trimmings or moderately fat trimmings,\r\n  22 pounds pork neck fat,\r\n   8¹⁄₂ pounds corn flour,\r\n  55 pounds water,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   1 pound white pepper,\r\n   3 ounces mace,\r\n   2¹⁄₂ ounces saltpetre,\r\n  12 ounces sugar,\r\n   2 ounces grated onions,\r\n   3 ounces garlic,\r\n   8 ounces color water.\r\n\r\nStuff in beef rounds and tie with twine every five inches. Knuckle meat\r\nmay be ground through a moderately fine plate. Balance of pork should\r\nbe chopped in a “Buffalo Silent Cutter.” Corn flour and seasoning\r\nshould be added to the knuckle meat after it is put into the Buffalo\r\nchopper and the machine has made two or three revolutions.\r\n\r\nSECOND METHOD.\r\n\r\n  50 pounds pork cheeks,\r\n  10 pounds tripe,\r\n  40 pounds standard pork trimmings,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   3 ounces mace,\r\n   9 ounces sugar,\r\n   3 ounces garlic,\r\n  35 pounds pork trimmings (lean),\r\n  15 pounds D. T. or S. P. trimmings,\r\n   9 pounds corn flour,\r\n  ¹⁄₈ ounce pepper,\r\n   4 ounces coriander,\r\n   3 ounces saltpetre,\r\n  30 pounds water.\r\n\r\nGrind pork cheeks through ⁷⁄₆₄ plate “Enterprise” cutter. Transfer to\r\nsilent cutter, add water and chop one minute, add balance of trimmings\r\nand chop five minutes, then pass to shelving room, stuff in beef round\r\ncasings, tie with No. 12 twine in four-inch links. Smoke at 110° for\r\none hour and increase temperature to 135° for one and one-half hours.\r\nCook twenty minutes at 155° and chill after cooking, draw and pass to\r\nhanging room.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polish Style Sausage._--Formula for making this sausage is as follows:\r\n\r\n  100 pounds beef cheek meat, or shank meat,\r\n   50 pounds dry salt or pickled pork trimmings,\r\n   50 pounds pork trimmings,\r\n    9 pounds corn flour,\r\n   30 pounds water,\r\n    1 pound white pepper,\r\n    5 pounds salt,\r\n    6 ounces saltpetre,\r\n    6 ounces coriander,\r\n    3 ounces garlic.\r\n\r\nGrind the beef cheek meat through a ⁷⁄₆₄th plate, add corn flour and\r\nseasoning, work in as much water as possible and then add the pork\r\ntrimmings. This is a very coarse chopped sausage and the pork trimmings\r\nshould be chopped about as fine as small dice. Beef is the binder of\r\nthis sausage, and must be handled according to instructions. The meat,\r\nafter it is chopped, can be handled the same as Bologna and Frankfurt\r\nmeat by putting in a cooler for a few hours before stuffing. After the\r\nsausage is stuffed, it can also be handled as Bologna and Frankfurts,\r\nif desired, before smoking.\r\n\r\nThis sausage should be smoked carefully and strictly in accordance with\r\nthe smoking schedule, as it is not cooked, this being done practically\r\nin the smoke house, during the process of smoking. After it is smoked\r\nit has a very wrinkled appearance, which is essential for this article.\r\nIn fact, it is not Polish sausage unless it has this appearance.\r\n\r\nThe dicing of the meat other than the beef can be done with a rocker.\r\nNote that a “silent cutter” is not used in this manufacture. The\r\nsausage is stuffed in beef round casings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blood Sausage._--This sausage is made as follows:\r\n\r\n  205 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n   54 pounds pig skins,\r\n   47 pounds beef blood,\r\n    5 pounds onions,\r\n    7 pounds salt,\r\n    1 pound white pepper,\r\n    3 pounds corn flour,\r\n    8 ounces marjoram,\r\n    4 ounces cloves.\r\n\r\nUse pickled shoulder fat and skins, cook for one hour at a temperature\r\nof 210° F. and run through fat cutting machine or cut into size of\r\nsmall dice. Pass the beef blood through a fine sieve in order to\r\nseparate foreign matter. Cook pig skins for about two hours at a\r\ntemperature of 210° F. and grind through a ⁷⁄₆₄th plate. Mix the\r\nshoulder fat, skins, blood and seasoning thoroughly together and stuff\r\nin cap end bungs. Smoking and cooking as indicated in schedules.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tongue Sausage._--For Tongue Sausage the following formula is given:\r\n\r\n   50 pounds hog or sheep tongue,\r\n  130 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n   34 pounds hog skins,\r\n   30 pounds blood,\r\n    8 pounds salt,\r\n    1 pound, 4 ounces white pepper,\r\n    2 pounds onions,\r\n   10 ounces marjoram,\r\n    4 ounces cloves.\r\n\r\nUse pickled shoulder fat, skin and cook for one hour at a temperature\r\nof 210° F. and run through fat cutting machine or cut into size of\r\nsmall dice. Use beef blood, passed through a fine sieve in order to\r\nseparate any foreign material. Cook hog skins for about two hours at a\r\ntemperature of 210° F. and grind through a ⁷⁄₆₄th inch plate. Pickled\r\nsheep tongues are preferable to pickled hog tongues, as they are\r\nsmaller and make a better appearing sausage when cut. The tongue should\r\nbe cooked one and three-quarter hours at a temperature of 210° F.\r\n\r\nBefore mixing the above ingredients, rinse the fat off the tongues\r\nwith hot water in order to remove as much grease as possible. Mix\r\nthe ingredients thoroughly with the seasoning by hand. When stuffing\r\nput about four pieces of tongue to each bung. However, this varies\r\naccording to the size of the bungs used. Cap end bungs should be used\r\nin all cases. Smoking and cooking to be done as indicated in schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Minced Ham._--The following formula for Minced Ham is given:\r\n\r\n  50 pounds beef trimmings,\r\n  20 pounds pork cheek meat,\r\n  80 pounds regular pork trimmings,\r\n   5 pounds corn flour,\r\n  20 pounds water,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   8 ounces sugar,\r\n   3¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper,\r\n   3¹⁄₂ ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nGrind meats through a ⁷⁄₆₄th plate; pass to “Silent Cutter,” add water\r\nand spices; chop three minutes and shelve for curing. Stuff in calf\r\nbladders if available, otherwise small beef bladders.\r\n\r\nIn tying the bladders, it is best to use a wooden skewer and twine and\r\nit is preferable to use small calf bladders in place of large ones,\r\nas the time required for smoking and cooling is so long that if large\r\nbladders are used the weight of them would break the bladders where\r\nthey are skewered or tied and would result in shrinkage or loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New England or Pressed Ham._--This ham is made from dry cured pork\r\ntrimmings put down under the formula given. The best and leanest\r\ntrimmings obtainable are cured for this purpose. Shoulder blade\r\ntrimmings or lean shoulder trimmings are more desirable than any other\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAfter the trimmings have been cured sufficiently, which is when they\r\nshow a bright cured color throughout and are without dark spots in the\r\ncenter of the meat, the trimmings are weighed up in 100-pound batches,\r\nand about ten per cent of lean beef trimmings, ground through a\r\n⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate, is mixed thoroughly. Immediately after the trimmings\r\nare mixed the mass should be stuffed into large beef bung ends, usually\r\nfrom fourteen to sixteen inches long. To obtain the best results a\r\nstuffer arranged with a large sized filler is necessary. However, a\r\nhand stuffer arranged with a large sized filler, about three inches at\r\nthe small end, or opening, can be used. Care should be taken to stuff\r\nthe bungs as tightly as possible. They should be skewered instead of\r\ntied at the ends and should be wrapped with heavy twine, each piece\r\nhaving from four to six wrappings of the twine, which should terminate\r\nwith a hanger for the ham. The pieces are very heavy and will break\r\nduring the processes of smoking and cooking unless they are properly\r\nwrapped or tied.\r\n\r\nThis ham is smoked five hours at a temperature of from 130° to 140° F.\r\nand the house should be moderately warm before the ham is hung in the\r\nsmoke. A small fire should be started to dry off the casings, after\r\nwhich the meat should be smoked the same as Bologna. Cook at least\r\nthree hours at a temperature of 160° F. After it has been cooked it is\r\ntaken immediately to a cooler, where the temperature is from 38° to 40°\r\nF., and put under a press. If no press is obtainable place the ham in\r\nlayers, putting a board between each layer with a weight on top. Place\r\nthe hams in a pile or under the press so that they can be picked with a\r\nlong, thin skewer about one-half the thickness of a ham tryer in order\r\nto permit the water which is in the ham to escape. After pressure for\r\ntwelve hours, take them out and hang up so that boiling hot water can\r\nbe thrown on them to wash off the grease; thoroughly washed in this\r\nmanner remove to a dry cooler.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New Jersey Ham._--New Jersey ham is made according to the following\r\nformula:\r\n\r\n  60 pounds lean ham trimmings\r\n  80 pounds lean back trimmings,\r\n  10 pounds lean beef chucks or shank meat,\r\n   4 pounds, salt,\r\n   3¹⁄₂ pounds cracker meal,\r\n   4 ounces formula saltpetre,\r\n  12 ounces sugar,\r\n  ³⁄₄ ounce red pepper.\r\n\r\nBeef is ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate and rocked about\r\nfive minutes, when the pork trimmings are added with the seasoning.\r\nThe seasoning should all be mixed thoroughly and added to the meat.\r\nThe whole is then chopped about as coarse as summer sausage, or about\r\ntwenty to twenty-five minutes. It is taken to a cooler after being\r\nrocked and spread about six or eight inches thick on a table, where it\r\nis allowed to remain about three days at a temperature of from 38° to\r\n40° F.\r\n\r\nIt is then stuffed by hand stuffers into bags, which will weigh after\r\nbeing stuffed and dried about five pounds. These bags are made of heavy\r\ndrilled cloth and should be stuffed as tightly as possible. They should\r\nbe kept very clean during the process of stuffing, as any sausage meat\r\nwhich may stick to the cloth will leave a bad appearance after the\r\nsausage has been smoked.\r\n\r\nAfter the ham has been stuffed, it should be taken to the dry room,\r\nwhere the temperature can be kept at all times between 46° and 55°\r\nF., 50° being preferable. The room must be airy and dry and it will\r\ntake at least ten days under favorable circumstances to get the ham\r\nin proper condition to smoke. It should be smoked about four hours in\r\nas cold a smoke as possible, 70° to 75° F. being as hot as it is safe\r\nto smoke it, 60° F. being nearer the proper temperature. After it has\r\nbeen smoked, it should be again hung in a cool temperature for three\r\ndays, when it will be ready for shipment. This sausage is manufactured\r\nextensively in New Jersey and the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Head Cheese._--Head cheese is made as follows:\r\n\r\n  44 pounds cooked pig skins,\r\n  55 pounds cooked pig snouts,\r\n  33 pounds cooked pig ears,\r\n  55 pounds cooked beef hearts,\r\n  51 pounds cooked neck fat,\r\n  20 pounds water in which the meat has been cooked,\r\n   1 pound white pepper,\r\n  10 pounds onions,\r\n   4 ounces allspice,\r\n   2 ounces cloves,\r\n   3 ounces marjoram,\r\n   3 ounces carroway seeds.\r\n\r\nThe cooked meats are chopped by hand with a knife until reduced to the\r\nproper size, except the skins, which are ground through a ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch\r\nplate after being cooked. The mass usually is mixed by hand and stuffed\r\ninto cured hog paunches or beef bungs and cooked as per cooking\r\nschedule appended hereto. After the sausage is cooked, it is taken to\r\na cooler and usually pressed by laying the paunches or bungs side by\r\nside with a board between each layer and a moderate weight on top of\r\nthe last board. However, if properly made this is unnecessary as the\r\ngelatine from the skins and the water in which the meat has been cooked\r\nwill bind the other ingredients together sufficiently without much, if\r\nany, pressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boneless Pigs Feet._--This product is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\n  25 pounds fresh pigs feet,\r\n  30 pounds fresh pigs skins,\r\n  15 pounds fresh pigs snouts,\r\n  15 pounds fresh pigs ears,\r\n  20 pounds fresh pork trimmings,\r\n  15 pounds fresh beef trimmings,\r\n  10 pounds white pepper,\r\n  50 pounds water in which meat has been cooked,\r\n   4 pounds, 1 ounce salt,\r\n   4 ounces cloves.\r\n\r\nUse one gallon (45-grain) vinegar to five-hundred pounds of the above\r\nmass. Cook all of the meats in one vat, thoroughly, in pudding nets,\r\nand chop same as headcheese, mix seasoning, water and vinegar with the\r\nmeat in a large tub or tight-bottom truck.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to use tin moulds for this sausage and they are\r\ngenerally of one size, shaped as a ten-pound wooden bucket or other\r\nsized packages which may be intended to be used for shipping purposes.\r\nFill these molds with the mixed mass and put on top of each a wooden\r\nblock the size of the mold and about three inches thick. Then remove to\r\na cooler and press tightly by placing on top a board with a weight. In\r\norder to obtain the best results, the molds or cans should be cooled\r\nquickly, therefore a temperature of about 36° F. is desirable. To\r\nremove the contents from the cans or molds, submerge in hot water for a\r\nfew seconds, when the meat will loosen from the sides of the molds and\r\ncan be turned out readily.\r\n\r\nAfter the product has been removed from the molds allow it to stand for\r\na short while in the cooler before placing in shipping packages.\r\n\r\nThis sausage can be made without using wooden tops on the cans or molds\r\nand without pressing it. If the pig skins, after they are cooked, are\r\nground through a ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate and then mixed with the mass, more\r\nof a jelly will be produced and they will not require pressing. In\r\npreparing meats be particular to remove all bone, gristle or cartilage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liver Sausage._--The following formula is for Liver Sausage:\r\n\r\n  20 pounds cooked lean pork trimmings,\r\n  20 pounds cooked pork cheek meat,\r\n  20 pounds cooked pork skins,\r\n  10 pounds cooked hog livers,\r\n  50 pounds cooked tripe,\r\n   6 pounds cooked shoulder fat,\r\n   3 pounds salt,\r\n   3 pounds onions,\r\n   9 ounces white pepper,\r\n   2 ounces marjoram,\r\n   2 ounces cloves,\r\n   1¹⁄₂ ounces allspice.\r\n\r\nAbove is all ground through a ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate except the shoulder\r\nfat, which is run through a fat cutting machine or cut into size of\r\nsmall dice. It is necessary to mix this sausage in a sausage mixer.\r\nThe seasoning should be put into the mixer when starting to mix,\r\nbut the shoulder fat should not be put in until about half through.\r\nStuff immediately into hog bungs, or beef middles, as desired. Cook\r\nimmediately as per cooking table and then place in cooler, at a\r\ntemperature of 36° to 40° F. until thoroughly chilled, when it is ready\r\nfor shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boneless Ham._--This is made from pork shoulder butts, cured in sweet\r\npickle and stuffed in small No. 2 beef bungs. Smoke forty-eight hours\r\nat a temperature of 120° F. The bungs may be slightly colored, the same\r\nas Polish sausage casings, before stuffing, if desired. Not cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cottage Ham._--This is made from boneless ham butts or shoulder butts,\r\ncured the same as boneless ham butts. It is not stuffed but strung from\r\nthe large end of the butt and smoked thirty-two hours at a temperature\r\nof 120° F. and not cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stuffed Hogs Heads._--Select a well shaped head, cut off about three\r\nto four pounds behind the ears and remove the bones. Care should be\r\ntaken in entering above the eyes, where the skin is thinnest and lies\r\ndirectly on the bone. Do not remove the snout bones, but saw off the\r\nhindmost jaw bone right behind the mouth. Remove the cheek meat on\r\neither side until with the skin it is about one-half inch thick. Cut\r\noff about three inches square from the lower cheek at the back to make\r\nthe head more shapely. Sew from the snout up the back bone, where the\r\nhead is to be filled and cut around cover from the skin to fit the back\r\nopening. Prepare the stuffing as follows:\r\n\r\nGood firm young pork, moderately fat, is coarsely chopped with the\r\nrequired quantity of salt and allowed to stand twenty-four hours. Use\r\nabout ten pounds chopped fine, spiced with five and one-quarter ounces\r\nof salt, one-half ounce of ground white pepper, seventy-seven grains of\r\nfinely ground mace, mixed with one pound of boiled tongue meat cut into\r\nshape of dice, one-half the size of a walnut. Mix all thoroughly and\r\nfill head with the mass. Sew the cover on and smoke for two hours until\r\nit turns to a yellow brown color. After it is smoked, tie the head up\r\nin a cloth, wrapping a string around it very evenly from front to rear.\r\nCook in boiling water from three to three and one-half hours, and then\r\nallow to cool. The head must be a chestnut brown when thoroughly smoked\r\nand cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scrapple._--For making scrapple use two pig heads, two pig tongues and\r\ntwo pig livers. These should be cooked in an iron-jacketed kettle that\r\nwill hold about forty-five gallons. Cover thoroughly and then remove\r\nfrom kettle and cut up the same as for head cheese. After the heads,\r\ntongues and livers are taken from the water, skim the grease and add\r\nforty pounds of corn meal and five pounds of buckwheat to the water,\r\nputting in a little at a time, stirring as put in. Cook slowly for five\r\nhours. Seasoning should be added before buckwheat and corn meal are put\r\nin, consisting of:\r\n\r\n  2 ounces white pepper,\r\n  1 ounce red pepper,\r\n  8 ounces sage,\r\n  4 pounds salt.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal and water has been cooked about four hours and\r\nforty-five minutes, add the heads, tongues and livers, stir thoroughly\r\nabout fifteen minutes, shut off steam, and place in pan. When about\r\ncool, but while plastic, add to each pan top a coating of the grease\r\nskimmed from cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bologna Sausage in Oil._--This is a sausage manufactured quite\r\nextensively by packers, who find the principal markets for it in the\r\nsouth. In fact, it is not used anywhere but in warm climates and it is\r\nusually put up in twenty-pound and fifty-pound tin packages.\r\n\r\nMuch experimenting has been done to ascertain the best size for\r\npackages to put up sausage in oil. The following formula is generally\r\nconsidered to be a good method for making this sausage:\r\n\r\n  20 pounds fresh head pork meat,\r\n  50 pounds fresh pork hearts,\r\n  30 pounds fresh regular pork trimmings,\r\n  15 pounds fat pork trimmings,\r\n  80 pounds fresh beef cheek meat,\r\n   1 pound, 8 ounces corn flour,\r\n   3 pounds, 8 ounces salt,\r\n  ¹⁄₂ ounce cloves,\r\n  ¹⁄₂ ounce coriander,\r\n   3 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nStuff in different sized beef rounds. The beef cheek meat, pork hearts,\r\nand pork cheek meat are ground through a ⁷⁄₆₄th inch plate, and\r\nafterward chopped with a “Silent Cutter” the seasoning being added at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nUse no water in this sausage under any circumstances. After the beef\r\nand beef hearts, also the pork cheek meat, have been chopped as fine as\r\ndesired, add the pork trimmings and chop the same as any other Bologna.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to stuff this sausage immediately after it is chopped,\r\nand if a steam stuffer is used care should be taken that no water from\r\nthe evaporation of the steam is allowed to get into the sausage. The\r\nbench where the sausage is stuffed should be absolutely free from water\r\nor moisture. This is the principal factor in the successful manufacture\r\nof this product.\r\n\r\nAfter the sausage is stuffed, it is smoked about three hours at a\r\ntemperature of 150° to 160° F., or until it is dry clear through. This\r\nsausage is not cooked. Keep it away from all water and moisture.\r\n\r\nAfter the sausage is smoked allow it to cool in a dry airy room, but\r\ndo not put it in a cooler. When it is thoroughly cool, pack into\r\ntwenty-pound and fifty-pound packages, as desired, as follows: In\r\ntwenty-pound cans, place sixteen pounds Bologna and four pounds oil. In\r\nfifty-pound cans, place thirty-six pounds Bologna and fourteen pounds\r\noil.\r\n\r\nIn order to pack the cans properly, it is necessary to stuff different\r\nsized beef rounds, as mentioned above, so that they will fit in nicely\r\nwithout breaking the casings, and without filling the cans too full.\r\n\r\nAfter the cans have been filled with the required amount of Bologna,\r\ncrimp on the summer top, which has a two-inch hole and a cap to fit.\r\nFill the cans as full as possible with deodorized cotton seed oil,\r\nwhich must be cold. Allow the cans to stand for thirty minutes, then\r\nrefill so that the oil runs over the top through the hole, put on the\r\ncap immediately and solder right through the oil which will accumulate\r\naround the cap and on the top of the can. This will not hinder the\r\nprocess of soldering and it prevents the possibility of any air getting\r\ninto the cans.\r\n\r\nAfter the caps have been secured, solder around the crimps of the\r\nsummer top. This can be done before the oil is put in if desired.\r\nExtreme care must be used in soldering the cans so that no air whatever\r\ngets in, or oil leaks out, as the sausage will spoil if this occurs.\r\n\r\nThe cans should also be fitted with the regular covers so as to protect\r\nthe summer top. Pack in crates, the twenty-pound size, two to four to\r\na crate; the fifty-pound size, one to two to a case.\r\n\r\nThe case should be large enough so as to admit of packing sawdust\r\nbeneath the bottom, around the sides and on the tops. A crate large\r\nenough to permit one-half inch space around the cans is the size\r\ngenerally used and there should be a partition in the crates where more\r\nthan one can is packed in a crate.\r\n\r\nIn freighting this class of merchandise in the south, in fact wherever\r\nit is shipped, it receives more or less rough handling and a great many\r\nfreight handlers use box hooks, which they stick into the sides of\r\nthe crates, and if there is not sufficient protection from the amount\r\nof sawdust put in, the cans are punctured, the oil leaks out and the\r\nsausage spoils. Sausage handled in the above manner has been known to\r\nkeep two years in temperature ranging from 40° to 100° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pork Sausage in Oil._--Use the same formula as for regular pork\r\nsausage except that the trimmings must be moderately lean, and the\r\nsausage _absolutely_ free from water. Use also the same spices. Stuff\r\nimmediately after the sausage is chopped, using the same care as to\r\nmoisture as for Bologna in oil, and smoke over a very cold smoke until\r\nthe sausage seems dry all the way through. Allow it to cool, handling\r\nand packing in every other respect the same as Bologna Oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bologna Varnish.=--Where it can be used and not conflict with Food\r\nregulations bologna varnish can be used to advantage. It improves\r\nthe appearance and decreases shrinkage. As considerable water is\r\nused, in addition to the natural moisture in meats there is, after\r\nit is manufactured, considerable shrinkage, and if allowed to hang\r\nfor any length of time, the casings become wrinkled on account of\r\nthe evaporation of this internal moisture. The varnishing of the\r\nsausage creates a covering on the outside which prevents this wrinkled\r\nappearance, improving its looks, and retarding the evaporation of\r\nmoisture from the sausage. The formula is as follows:\r\n\r\n   6 pounds white shellac,\r\n   1 pound boracic acid,\r\n   2 pounds aqua ammonia,\r\n  14 pounds of water.\r\n\r\nThe mixture should be put into a vessel and heated to a point where the\r\nshellac is well dissolved. When this is accomplished, add four gallons\r\nof water. This varnish, in order to be ready for use at any time, must\r\nbe kept lukewarm. It should, therefore, be kept in a jacketed pan,\r\nsurrounded by either hot water or steam, to hold it at the proper\r\ntemperature. The sausage should be immersed and immediately hung up to\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nThis varnish can be used without any detrimental effect whatever on\r\nall kinds of smoked Bologna sausage or smoked cooked pressed ham.\r\nIt preserves the sausage, keeps it from molding, and is especially\r\neffective where it is necessary to pack Bologna in boxes for shipment\r\nlong distances.\r\n\r\nWhere the dipping pan is used, it is only necessary to dip the sausage\r\nin the above solution a few seconds before hanging on racks to dry. The\r\nsausage is usually ready for shipment in one hour after it is dipped,\r\nif the preparation is properly made, where a large amount of Bologna is\r\nbeing dipped it is, of course, necessary to have a larger dripping pan\r\nand a larger quantity of varnish. The proportions should be increased\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is also important that, after the varnish has stood from one\r\nperiod of dipping to another, to skim the grease off the top of the\r\nvarnish before again using it, and the Bologna should always be dipped\r\nimmediately after it is taken from the cooking vats; in other words,\r\nwhile _hot_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Boiled Ham.=--Boiled ham and shoulders, also cooked meats, are usually\r\nincluded as a sausage product. There is nothing that determines the\r\ncost of the finished product as much as the shrinkage, hence the method\r\nthat will produce the least loss in weight from original to finished\r\nproduct is the process desired.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of cooking hams, one is to steam them in a\r\nretort or some receptacle where they are cooked by the heat generated\r\nby steam; another is to cook them in water. The latter process, from\r\ncareful observation, seems to be the one that gives the best results\r\nas regards the shrinkage, although steaming perhaps makes the ham more\r\npalatable. The hams before being cooked should be bound and wrapped\r\nwith twine to hold them in shape. A form made of galvanized iron,\r\nclamping plates which are put into a press, with the ham tightly\r\nclamped on the inside should be used. The ham is cooked and chilled in\r\nthis mold.\r\n\r\nThe cure of the ham has much to do with the shrinkage and it is\r\ntherefore preferable to use fully cured hams instead of old cured hams,\r\nas the shrinkage is greater on over-cured meats. It is also advisable\r\nto sort the hams as to size, having each vat or tank of hams uniform.\r\nIf not uniform in size there is an excessive shrinkage on small hams\r\nwhich are overcooked. In all cases the hams should be soaked, removing\r\nthe surplus salt. The length and time of soaking depends altogether on\r\nthe age of the meats. The hams should be thoroughly washed and if they\r\nare to be branded this should be done before they are boned or cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rules for Boiling Hams._--When hams are boned (if desirable) and\r\nwrapped, they should be put into a vat of water, temperature about 212°\r\nand the temperature regulated until it reaches 155° to 160° F. The hams\r\nare held at this temperature until they are cooked, which requires\r\nsomewhat longer time than when they are cooked, by steam at a higher\r\ntemperature. A twelve-pound ham will require from four and one-half to\r\nfive hours. After the hams are cooked they should be allowed to cool\r\nin the water in which they were cooked; not taken out, or drained, or\r\nset in the cooler, for in the water in which they are cooked are juices\r\nwhich are absorbed by the hams as they cool, and the shrinkage is much\r\nless than if taken out immediately. The hams should then be taken to\r\nthe smoke house, laid on racks and given a very light smoke, then to\r\nthe cooler.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shrinkage in Boiling Hams._--Hams taken out of pickle and drained for\r\ntwelve hours to shipping weight, will show the following shrinkages\r\nunder favorable circumstances:\r\n\r\n                                                              Per cent.\r\n  Hams not boned, smoked after cooking                        9    to 12\r\n  Hams with bone out, including the shank bone, skin on,\r\n  not fatted                                                 12¹⁄₂ to 18\r\n  Hams with bone out, skin lifted, fat removed               18    to 23\r\n  Hams with bone out, the skin and fat removed               33    to 40\r\n  Hams skinned, fatted, bones left in                        28    to 35\r\n  Skinned shoulders, bone out                                30    to 35\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nDRIED SAUSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n  SUMMER SAUSAGE -- PRESERVATIVES -- COOLING ROOM -- STUFFING --\r\n  HANGING ROOM -- SMOKE HOUSE -- DRY ROOM TREATMENT -- DRY ROOM CAUTION\r\n  -- SHIPPING AGES -- STORAGE -- PREPARATION OF CASINGS -- TRIMMING\r\n  MEATS -- FORMULAS FOR SAUSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summer Sausage.=--Under the head of “Summer Sausage” we take up an\r\nentirely different article, a sausage that is dried and smoked (not\r\ncooked), during which time the ingredients used for seasoning effect\r\na cure. This sausage will keep for months if properly handled. It is\r\nnecessary, however, that every detail be very carefully watched, as a\r\nslight omission or error in its manufacture causes immense losses at\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nAs this is strictly an air dried sausage, weather conditions have a\r\ngreat deal to do with its successful manufacture, and it is necessary\r\nto have special facilities in the way of coolers, smoke houses and\r\ndry rooms, the proper arrangement of which is somewhat expensive. Air\r\nconditioning and fan circulation can be used. It is impracticable for\r\nany manufacturer to attempt to make this article in large quantities\r\nunless he has proper facilities, and it is the manufacturers who do\r\nmake it in large quantities that are financially successful, and are\r\nable to keep their cost of production to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preservatives.=--Previous to the enactment of the Pure Food Laws the\r\nliberal use of preservatives made the handling of summer sausage, while\r\nalways requiring care, a matter of not so great consequence as at\r\npresent. Now, the only preservative used is the agent saltpetre, and\r\nsuch preservative help as is obtained from the spices which are used.\r\nThese conditions require the use of absolutely sweet materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooling Room.=--Clean airy cooling rooms are necessary. They should\r\nbe provided with spreading shelves of sufficient area to allow the\r\ncut spiced meats to be spread from twelve to forty-eight hours so\r\nas to enable the spices, saltpetre and salt to permeate the product\r\nbefore stuffing and to make the meat firm. If the sausage is stuffed\r\nimmediately after it is rocked, it is liable to wrinkle in the smoke\r\nhouse, which gives it an unsavory appearance. Temperature of room\r\nshould be 37° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stuffing.=--The stuffing should be performed in a semi-cool room,\r\nusing mechanical or hand operated stuffers at a moderate pressure. Some\r\nmanufacturers use steam or hydraulic equipment, but these are usually\r\narranged so that no moisture, condensation or drip comes in contact\r\nwith the meats. The temperature of the room should be about 45° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hanging Room.=--A hanging room in which the temperature can be\r\nproperly controlled should be available in which the sausage can be\r\nhung until the casings are sufficiently dried for smoking. While the\r\nsausage should be dry, it should not be allowed to become so dry that\r\nthe casings are glossy or hard. This is a very important matter as the\r\nsausage will not take the correct color if the smoke does not penetrate\r\nthe casings, or if they are allowed to become too dry. This applies\r\nparticularly to sausage stuffed in beef middles, also to sausage\r\nstuffed in hog bungs, though not to so great an extent.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the sausage for the smoking process, by endeavoring to\r\nprevent the sausage from becoming too dry there is danger of their\r\nbecoming slimy, which is more detrimental than excessive dryness. Slimy\r\nsausage will not take the smoke and will sour quickly if not properly\r\nhandled. Sausage in both beef casings and hog casings should be dried\r\nbefore smoking, so that the outside will feel about dry to the touch.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain this result it is necessary to have plenty of\r\nhanging room so that the proper temperature and ventilation is\r\navailable for the entire lot of sausage which is being prepared for\r\nsmoke. If the sausage is too closely hung it should be moved about\r\nfrom the center to the sides of the room occasionally so that all the\r\nsausage receives the same ventilation.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer should have sufficient space to allow the sausage to\r\nhang after it is stuffed and before it is smoked, for from two to three\r\ndays, and sometimes longer. In the winter season, which is the proper\r\ntime for manufacturing high grade summer sausage, it is a good practice\r\nto allow it to hang as long as possible before smoking, but it must be\r\nwatched to prevent sliming or becoming too dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Smoke Houses.=--The smoke houses should be built of brick, sheet\r\niron houses which have been experimented with, especially for summer\r\nsausage, have proved to be complete failures. The brick not only\r\nprotect the house from the varying outside temperatures, but retain the\r\nheat, which is desirable and necessary in the successful smoking of\r\nthis kind of sausage.\r\n\r\nSmoke houses are preferably equipped with rails and trolleys. The\r\nhouses are usually built like ham houses, viz: 12 × 12 feet, or some\r\nsize convenient to the trolleys to be used.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the fire should be in any case, whether the track\r\nsystem or the ordinary smoke house with the beam system is used, twelve\r\nfeet, and in some cases, such as in smoking summer sausage in bladders,\r\nor Braunschweiger in hog casings, the distance from the fire should be\r\ntwenty feet or more. This, however, will be explained in the formulas\r\nfor making the different kinds of sausage.\r\n\r\nThe main point to be considered in the construction of a smoke house\r\nfor summer sausage is to have it so arranged that the heat can be\r\nregulated to different temperatures, also the amount of smoking, as\r\neach kind of sausage requires a different temperature. The ventilation\r\nof the smoke house should be perfect and absolutely controllable, as\r\nthe weather conditions have a great deal to do with the successful\r\nsmoking of sausage and the houses should be arranged so that they\r\ncan be kept at a uniform temperature and humidity during any kind of\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of domestic sausage, no smoke house should be used for\r\nsummer sausage unless the temperature can be maintained uniform and the\r\nwalls in proper condition.\r\n\r\nSince, summer sausage is not cooked before it goes to smoke, a cold or\r\ndamp smoke house will “ring” the sausage even quicker than a cold smoke\r\nhouse will “ring” Bologna, therefore extreme caution should be used in\r\nthis particular.\r\n\r\nHardwood and hardwood sawdust are used exclusively in smoking summer\r\nsausage, and both wood and sawdust should be absolutely dry when the\r\nfire is started. In some cases, however, after the sausage is very\r\nnearly smoked, it is advisable to use a little damp sawdust before\r\ncompleting the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dry Room Treatment.=--After the smoking process is completed the\r\nsausage is taken to the drying rooms where the temperature can be kept\r\nat all times between 46° and 53° F., the proper temperature being 48°\r\nF., if it can be maintained. The dry room must be fitted with steam\r\npipes running underneath the sausage and around the sides of the room\r\nand underneath the windows in order to supply the necessary heat. The\r\nroom must be supplied with ample windows for light and ventilation and\r\nshould be very high so as to permit the required overhead ventilation.\r\nAt all times the windows must be kept open a little to allow fresh air\r\nto enter no matter how cold the outside temperature. If the weather\r\nis damp the windows nearest the top or the top ventilator of the room\r\nshould be opened a little. Sausage is not usually hung adjacent to the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nSteam should always be turned on in damp weather to dry the air,\r\nproviding the weather is not too warm and the temperature in the room\r\ncan be kept as low as 53° F. The room should be arranged in sections,\r\nso that there may be an empty section between each lot of new sausage.\r\nAs the sausage becomes drier it can be hung more closely. The sausage,\r\nshould not dry too quickly as too much air will dry it near the casing,\r\nwhich will cause the sausage to stick to it and become dry. In that\r\ncase the inside will not dry uniformly and the sausage will wrinkle and\r\nin some instances become sour.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of sausage require different places in the dry\r\nroom. Some require an abundance of air and others, like “Holsteiner”\r\nand “farmer” sausage, if properly smoked, can be hung where it would\r\nnot be policy to hang summer sausage in hog bungs. As both of these\r\nsausages are coarse chopped, they can be handled with much less fear\r\nof being spoiled than the finer chopped sausage. However, with every\r\ndescription of dry sausage, constant attention must be given or poor\r\nresults will follow.\r\n\r\nSummer sausage in hog bungs can be subjected to more draft or air than\r\nsummer sausage in beef casings. Consequently beef casings are generally\r\nhung near the center of the room where they receive plenty of air, but\r\nno drafts. This is a place where the human element comes greatly into\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dry Room Caution.=--Do not hang green and dry sausage in the same\r\nroom. It is advisable to keep dry rooms for smoked sausage as free from\r\nmold as possible. While a slight mold does not hurt summer sausage\r\n(in fact some summer sausage requires this before it is ready for\r\nshipment), it will be found that smoked sausage drys better and quicker\r\nin a room that can be kept free of mold. Sausage that molds too much\r\nbefore it is dry necessarily has to be washed. This process does not\r\nhurt the sausage, and in some cases washing does it good, especially\r\nif by neglect or otherwise it has become greasy in the smoke house.\r\nSausage will not dry as rapidly if greasy and the process of washing it\r\nquickens the drying. In washing sausage warm water, not hot, should be\r\nused. A little sal soda in the water is desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shipping Ages.=--Summer sausage in both hog bungs and beef casings\r\nif properly handled can be shipped, in three stages of dryness, as\r\nfollows: New, twenty to twenty-five days old; medium dry, forty to\r\nforty-five days old; dry, sixty to seventy-five days old. In cheaper\r\ngrades of summer sausage, many kinds of which are manufactured, can\r\nbe shipped in much less time than indicated above. In fact, there is\r\nsausage made which can be shipped almost immediately from the smoke\r\nhouse. This sausage is allowed to stand for some time after chopping\r\nand before stuffing, previous to being put in the smoke house. It is\r\nthen smoked very hard, or with more heat than the better grades of this\r\nsausage. Some manufacturers use more heat than smoke, but it does not\r\nproduce a first-class article.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Storage.=--Summer sausage when thoroughly dried should be stored in a\r\ncooler at a temperature of 35° F. It can be so handled if boxed, but it\r\nis preferable that it hang from racks, closely, since it will require\r\nan inspection upon shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparation of Casings.=--In preparing casings for summer sausage\r\nof all kinds it is necessary, in order to insure good results, that\r\ncasings be prepared, certainly hog bungs, at least thirty days or even\r\nseveral months before they are used. There are always many fat bungs\r\nin hog casings and in preparing them and putting them down in salt\r\nbrine for thirty days or longer, the fat on the casings becomes dry\r\nand there is less danger of the sausage becoming sour. Summer sausage\r\nwill become sour as quickly from using fat hog bungs as from any other\r\ncause, therefore these must be thoroughly fatted before they leave the\r\npreparing rooms. They are generally in good condition in this respect\r\nwhen received, and therefore do not require as much time in the curing\r\nor preparing as do hog bungs. Fat beef middles or beef rounds spoil the\r\nappearance of the goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trimming Meats.=--The selection and the trimming of meats for summer\r\nsausage is a matter of great consequence. Sinews, muscle cover and\r\ntough binding elements should be removed so as to avoid the sausage\r\nbeing tough in the eating. All knives and cutting tools should be sharp.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Formulas.=--Under the formulas given below are descriptions of the\r\nmethods of manufacture in detail rather than generalizing. Where the\r\nterm “rocking” is used it describes cutting with a rocker cutter. The\r\ndescription for making Cervelat should be carefully noted, as the\r\nmethods are utilized with slight changes in making other kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cervelat Style Sausage._--A very satisfactory formula for this sausage\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\nFORMULA A.\r\n\r\n  40 pounds beef chucks, very lean and entirely free from all sinews,\r\n  90 pounds work trimmings, trimmed in same manner,\r\n  20 pounds shoulder fat, cut into strips about 2 inches square and cut\r\n     into shavings as fine as it is possible to get them,\r\n   5 pounds, 12 ounces salt,\r\n   2 ounces whole white pepper,\r\n   6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nThe beef is first ground through a ⁷⁄₁₆-inch plate, after which it is\r\nplaced on the rocker together with the fat and seasoning and rocked for\r\nabout five minutes. Then the pork trimmings are added, the whole being\r\nrocked for from twenty-five to thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nThe pepper is spread through the meat during the rocking process, and\r\nabout five minutes before rocking finished. The sausage is taken to a\r\ncooler where the temperature is not lower than 38° F., nor higher than\r\n40° F. It is spread upon shelving about ten or twelve inches thick,\r\nwhere it is allowed to remain three days, after which it is stuffed by\r\nhand machines into hog bungs or beef middles as required.\r\n\r\nThe sausage is taken to the hanging room to hang for two or three days\r\naccording to the weather, at a temperature of from 48° to 50° F. If the\r\nweather is damp care must be taken to prevent the sausage from sliming\r\nand it is sometimes necessary to keep the temperature up to 55° F. in\r\norder to keep the room free from dampness. If the sausage begins to\r\nslime there is danger of its becoming sour or hollow in the center. It\r\nis advisable, if it is impossible otherwise to keep the sausage from\r\nsliming, to put it into smoke as soon as the slime is detected, which\r\nstops it.\r\n\r\nWhen the sausage is ready for smoke, under favorable circumstances,\r\nfrom two to three days after it is stuffed it should be hung in a smoke\r\nhouse where the temperature is as near 48° F. and gradually heated\r\nuntil the temperature reaches 70° F. It must be kept at this point\r\nthroughout the entire process of smoking, or for about twenty-four\r\nhours for beef middles and forty-eight hours for hog bungs.\r\n\r\nIn starting a fire in the smoke house as little wood should be used as\r\npossible, say, one stick of ash cord wood, just enough fire to keep\r\nthe sawdust smoking without blazing. Keep adding sawdust until there\r\nis sufficient fire to scatter it over the entire bottom of the smoke\r\nhouse, keeping the sawdust ignited only from the coals of the wood\r\nwith which the fire was started and which generally lasts through the\r\nentire process of smoking. If the smoke houses are naturally cold it\r\nmay be necessary to keep more fire than mentioned in order to keep the\r\ntemperature up to 70° F.\r\n\r\nThe smoking of this sausage requires all possible care. If the\r\ntemperature is allowed to rise too high for any length of time, it\r\nwill sour. If the fire is too low and smoke too dense there will be a\r\nsmoke ring, especially so if the sausage is not properly dried before\r\nsmoking. It is advisable that the sausage should not be exposed to too\r\nsudden or severe a change in temperature upon removing from the smoke\r\nhouse. If it is some distance from the smoke house to the dry room,\r\ncover the sausage on the trucks with a tarpaulin, cover so that the\r\ncold air cannot strike it. It is a good idea not to hang the sausage\r\nup on the racks immediately, but to place it on the bottom rack, close\r\ntogether, so that it may cool gradually.\r\n\r\nThe following are additional formulas for the making of cervelat\r\nsausage:\r\n\r\nFORMULA B.\r\n\r\n  45 pounds beef chucks,\r\n  82 pounds lean pork trimmings,\r\n  23 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n   5 pounds, 12 ounces salt,\r\n   2 ounces whole white pepper,\r\n   6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nFORMULA C.\r\n\r\n  30 pounds pork cheek meat,\r\n  30 pounds beef trimmings,\r\n  90 pounds pork trimmings,\r\n   5 pounds, 12 ounces salt,\r\n   2 ounces whole white pepper,\r\n   6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nFORMULA D.\r\n\r\n  40 pounds pork cheek meat,\r\n  30 pounds beef trimmings,\r\n  50 pounds lean pork trimmings,\r\n  20 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n  10 pounds pickled pork trimmings,\r\n   5 pounds, 12 ounces salt,\r\n   2 ounces whole white pepper,\r\n   6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nTrim beef chucks very lean, free from sinews. Pork trimmings must be\r\nlean except in Formula C, where fat pork trimmings are used. Shoulder\r\nfat should be handled the same as in Formula A. Pickled pork trimmings\r\nare ground through an Enterprise ¹⁄₄-inch plate. Beef chucks and\r\ntrimmings are ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄-inch plate. Pork\r\ntrimmings and cheeks are chopped on a rocker; otherwise handled same as\r\nFormula A.\r\n\r\nIf neck fat is used it is cut into small pieces but not shaved. If fat\r\nfrom Boston butts is used it is run through an Enterprise ¹⁄₄-inch\r\nplate. This fat, of course, has more or less lean in it but might be\r\ncalled very fat trimmings. Pork hearts, beef cheek and shank meat are\r\nall ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄-inch plate. Beef and fat are\r\nalways put on the block with the seasoning first. Pork trimmings and\r\ncheeks are added five or ten minutes after rocking; otherwise handled\r\nsame as Formulas A, B, C and D.\r\n\r\nFORMULA E.\r\n\r\n  40 pounds shank meat,\r\n  30 pounds pork cheek meat,\r\n  10 pounds beef cheek meat,\r\n  10 pounds pork hearts,\r\n  20 pounds pork trimmings,\r\n  40 pounds neck fat or fat trimmed from Boston butts,\r\n   5 pounds, 12 ounces salt,\r\n   2 ounces whole white pepper,\r\n   6¹⁄₂ ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Farmers Style Sausage._--The following formulas are for Farmers\r\nSausage:\r\n\r\nFORMULA A.\r\n\r\n  50 pounds shank meat,\r\n  10 pounds beef cheek meat,\r\n  30 pounds pork trimmings,\r\n  30 pounds pork cheek meat,\r\n  10 pounds pickled pork trimmings,\r\n  20 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n   5 pounds, 12 ounces salt,\r\n   2 ounces whole white pepper,\r\n   6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nShank meat, beef cheek and pork cheek meat are ground through an\r\nEnterprise ¹⁄₄-inch plate; shank fat is cut into small pieces but not\r\nshaved. Ground material and shank fat should be put on the block first\r\nwith the seasoning and chopped five or ten minutes, when the pork\r\ntrimmings are added, the whole being chopped fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\nAs this meat is coarse, it should, after chopping be mixed in a mixer\r\nfour minutes and be thoroughly mixed by hand, after which it is taken\r\nto the cooler and handled the same as cervelat. It is stuffed in beef\r\nmiddles cut 11 inches in length, and allowed to hang in the dry room,\r\nsame as cervelat for the same length of time, before smoking. The same\r\nprecautions should be taken with this as with cervelat, relative to\r\nslime, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is smoked from six to eight hours at a temperature of from 65° to\r\n70° F. It must be handled very carefully in smoke as too much heat will\r\nwrinkle it. A great deal of farmer sausage is allowed to dry naturally\r\nwithout smoking, especially in the winter months, and where there is\r\nplenty of room and a proper place. However, in damp weather and in the\r\nsummer months it is always advisable to smoke it. This sausage can be\r\nmade throughout the summer months, provided there are proper dry rooms,\r\nwhich can be regulated and kept moderately cool. Some manufacturers\r\nuse dry cooler space in the summer time, kept at a temperature of 46°\r\nto 48° F., but the best results are obtained by drying in a room where\r\nthe sausage can have the benefit of the outside air. This sausage,\r\nif handled properly according to the directions, will be ready for\r\nshipment in twenty-five days; it should then be in a medium dry state.\r\n\r\nFORMULA B.\r\n\r\n  80 pounds medium fat pork trimmings,\r\n  20 pounds pork cheek meat,\r\n  50 pounds beef trimmings or shank meat,\r\n   5 pounds, 12 ounces salt,\r\n   2 ounces whole white pepper,\r\n   6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nBeef and pork cheek meat ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄-inch plate.\r\nPut ground material with seasoning on block first and chop five or ten\r\nminutes, then add pork trimmings and chop fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\nStuff and handle same as Formula A.\r\n\r\nFORMULA C.\r\n\r\n   40 pounds beef trimmings or shank meat,\r\n   10 pounds pickled beef trimmings,\r\n  100 pounds pork trimmings,\r\n    5 pounds, 12 ounces salt,\r\n    2 ounces whole white pepper,\r\n    6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nThe beef trimmings or shank meat should be ground through an Enterprise\r\n⁷⁄₆₄-inch plate. Put ground material with seasoning on block first and\r\nchop five or ten minutes; then add pork trimmings and chop fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes. Stuff in beef middles; otherwise handle same as Formula\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Holstein Style Sausage._--This sausage is farmer sausage and is\r\nhandled the same except that it is stuffed in beef rounds. The same\r\ncare is necessary as with the farmer from the time it leaves the block\r\nuntil ready for shipment, which should be in about twenty-five days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Swedish Style Medwurst._--The following formula is for Swedish\r\nMedwurst or Gottberg sausage:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n  30 pounds pickled beef trimmings,\r\n  30 pounds fresh beef trimmings,\r\n  90 pounds medium fat pork trimmings,\r\n   1 pound rice flour or corn flour,\r\n   5¹⁄₂ pounds salt,\r\n   2 ounces coriander,\r\n   3¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper,\r\n   6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nBeef trimmings are ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate.\r\nGround beef and seasoning are put on block first and chopped five or\r\nten minutes when pork trimmings are added, the whole being chopped\r\ntwenty to twenty-five minutes. This sausage is stuffed in beef middles\r\n14 inches in length, and handled in other respects same as Cervelat in\r\nbeef middles.\r\n\r\nThe old fashioned way of handling Swedish medwurst was to pickle the\r\nsausage, after it was stuffed, in a vat of 50 degree strength pickle,\r\nfor ten hours, when it was taken out of the vats, hung up and allowed\r\nto dry for twenty-four hours, then smoked the same as cervelat in beef\r\nmiddles. If this process is used, four and one-half pounds of salt to\r\n150 pounds of meat is all that is necessary. However, good results can\r\nbe obtained without pickling the sausage, and it is not generally done\r\nby manufacturers of this article.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Braunschweiger Style Sausage._--This sausage is made according to the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n  50 pounds selected back fat trimmings,\r\n  45 pounds selected ham trimmings,\r\n  25 pounds selected shoulder trimmings,\r\n  20 pounds beef chucks trimmed extra lean and free from sinews,\r\n  10 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   2¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper (ground),\r\n   1 ounce whole white pepper,\r\n   6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nBeef chucks are ground through a ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate. Shoulder fat is cut\r\ninto strips about two inches square, and cut into shavings, as fine as\r\nit is possible to cut them. Ground beef, shoulder fat and seasoning are\r\nput on the block and rocked ten minutes when ham and shoulder trimmings\r\nare added, the back fat trimmings being the last to go on the block.\r\nThe whole is rocked twenty to thirty-five minutes. This is not a fine\r\nchopped sausage, however, and is not as coarse as farmer sausage but\r\na great deal coarser than regular cervelat. It should be stuffed into\r\nshort, lean, thick hog bungs about fourteen inches in length, and\r\nhandled in every respect, from the block to the smoke house, same as\r\ncervelat in hog bungs. As this is a very fat sausage greater care needs\r\nto be taken in smoking than with any other summer sausage made, and it\r\nshould be hung near the top of the smoke house as far away from the\r\nfire as possible. For this reason it is important that the sausage\r\nshould be properly dried after stuffing before smoking. Smoke at a\r\ntemperature as near 65° F. as possible for thirty-six to forty-eight\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_D’Arles Style Sausage._--This sausage is made as follows:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n  30 pounds extra lean beef chucks trimmed absolutely free from sinews,\r\n  70 pounds fresh lean especially trimmed pork shoulder trimmings free\r\n     from sinews,\r\n  30 pounds selected back fat pork trimmings,\r\n  20 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   2¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper (ground),\r\n   1 ounce whole pepper,\r\n   3 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nIn order to use the following additional seasoning it is advisable to\r\nchop at least six blocks of sausage, 150 pounds each, and mix in a\r\nlarge truck as this seasoning is to be added immediately after the meat\r\nhas been chopped. For 900 pounds, use:\r\n\r\n   ¹⁄₄-pound package pure white gelatine,\r\n  2    quarts strong imported French red wine,\r\n  1    whole nutmeg,\r\n  1¹⁄₄ ounces whole cloves,\r\n   ¹⁄₂ ounce stick cinnamon.\r\n\r\nPut the gelatine, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon in a thin bag and cook\r\nwith the wine for ten or fifteen minutes, just below boiling point.\r\nStrain the wine through a cloth to remove all particles of spice. When\r\nmoderately cool mix in the meat thoroughly by hand; at the same time\r\nmix in the shoulder fat, which is cut into shape of small dice chopped\r\non the rocker; the beef ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch\r\nplate; after which the mixture is placed on the rocker with the dry\r\nseasoning and rocked for seven to ten minutes, when the pork trimmings\r\nare added and the whole chopped eighteen to twenty-two minutes,\r\nproviding the speed of the rocker is from fifty-two to fifty-four\r\nstrokes per minute.\r\n\r\nThis is a coarse sausage but not as coarse as Farmer. Take to the\r\ncooler to remain from twelve to twenty-four hours. It is then stuffed\r\nby hand into No. 1 selected hog bungs entirely free from fat. Hang in\r\ndry room where the temperature is about 50° F. where it is entirely\r\nseparate from other sausage and where there is plenty of air but no\r\ncurrents. After it has hung for thirty-six to forty-eight hours, if\r\nfirm and the casing moderately dry, wrap the casings with No. 4 flax\r\ntwine commencing at the small end, making a hitch with the twine every\r\ntwo inches the whole length of the sausage to the top or the bung end;\r\nthen hitch back every inch on the off side and back and forth again\r\nuntil two more hitches are made so that the strings will be about\r\none-half inch apart when the last hitch is complete.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken to wrap the sausage tightly so that the strings will\r\nnot fall off in the process of drying. After the sausage has been wound\r\nwith string it should be taken to the dry room and dried very slowly\r\nwithout becoming moldy too soon. If hung in a room with other sausage,\r\nthis article should be hung between so that it will not get too much\r\nair or dry too quickly. It should be moved frequently, from the bottom\r\nto the top, and from the middle to the front and back of the section.\r\nThis is one of the most difficult of summer sausages to make and but\r\nfew manufacturers are successful in making them. Therefore the above\r\ninstructions should be followed closely to obtain satisfactory results.\r\nDo not smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Italian Style Salami._--Practically the same formula is used for\r\nItalian salami sausage as for D’Arles sausage, except that usually not\r\nas high grade trimmings either beef or pork, are required. However,\r\nit is advisable for a high grade Italian salami that the same grade\r\nof trimmings be used and the same care is taken in preparing them.\r\nIdentically the same seasoning is used and also the same procedure\r\nis followed in every respect in regard to the chopping and handling\r\nof the meat. Smaller or less expensive hog bungs are used. They are\r\nmedium primes and the sausage is usually shorter in length. This is a\r\nmatter of preference as this sausage is made in lengths of from twelve\r\nto twenty-two inches. Handling after stuffing, to the wrapping process,\r\nis the same as that for D’Arles sausage. Wrapping, however, is much\r\nsimpler and usually the same grade of twine is used, but instead of\r\nwrapping the twine both ways, it is simply wound around tightly after\r\nthree or four strings have been run from the top to the bottom of the\r\nsausage. This sausage is not smoked and is tied the same as D’Arles,\r\nthe same care being taken in every respect as regards temperatures, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Milanese Style Salami Sausage._--The formula for this sausage is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n  50 pounds fresh lean specially trimmed pork shoulder,\r\n       trimming free from sinews,\r\n  60 pounds fresh Boston butt trimmings,\r\n  20 pounds extra lean beef chucks, trimmed absolutely\r\n       free from sinews,\r\n  20 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   2¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper,\r\n   1¹⁄₂ ounces saltpetre,\r\n   1 ounce whole pepper.\r\n\r\nChop at least six blocks (900 pounds) of this sausage and mix at one\r\ntime by hand in a large truck constructed for the purpose, in order to\r\nadd the following additional seasoning. For the six blocks use:\r\n\r\n  3¹⁄₂ quarts strong imported French red wine,\r\n   ¹⁄₄-pound package pure white gelatine,\r\n  4    nutmegs,\r\n   ¹⁄₂ ounce whole cloves,\r\n  1    ounce stick cinnamon.\r\n\r\nPrepare same as similar formula for D’Arles sausage and mix with the\r\nmeat after it has been rocked by hand thoroughly. The beef is ground\r\nthrough an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate. Shoulder fat is cut into\r\nsmall thin pieces but not in the shape of dice. Rock the beef and\r\nthe shoulder fat together with the dry seasoning for seven to ten\r\nminutes, then add the pork trimmings, the whole being chopped twenty\r\nto twenty-five minutes. This sausage is not as coarse as D’Arles or\r\nItalian salami.\r\n\r\nAfter the meat and wet seasoning have been mixed thoroughly put in\r\ncooler twelve to twenty-four hours. Then stuff by hand into hog middle\r\nguts, as large as can be obtained. The way to stuff them successfully\r\nis to arrange a board to hold the casings after they are stuffed so\r\nthat it will be just high enough from the filler to permit the casings\r\nto be filled and not handled other than to hold them with sufficient\r\npressure to stuff as tightly as possible without breakage.\r\n\r\nIf the middles break, which they do in many cases, patch them with a\r\npiece of hog middle when they are being wound with string. They should\r\nbe lifted with care from the stuffing board, placed upon a truck and\r\nwrapped immediately with No. 4 flax twine, the same as D’Arles sausage,\r\nthe string running equidistant around the sausage from either end and\r\nbeing wound around it so as to form squares.\r\n\r\nAs the casings are so very tender, it requires great care in wrapping\r\nand the sausage is usually not of uniform appearance. Greater care must\r\nbe used in tying this sausage than D’Arles, salami or any other sausage\r\nknown. The casings are so thin that the meat will become dry and hard\r\non the outside or near the casings while the inside will remain moist,\r\ntherefore too much exposure is not desirable. They should be watched\r\nclosely after stringing, because, not being allowed to dry before they\r\nare strung, the handling which they get will naturally make them slime\r\nvery easily. It takes at least sixty days to dry this sausage properly\r\nwith the best conditions. Not smoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_German Style Salami._--This sausage may be made according to the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n   40 pounds beef chucks or beef shank meat,\r\n  110 pounds regular pork trimmings,\r\n    5 pounds salt,\r\n    5¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper,\r\n    1³⁄₄ ounces garlic,\r\n    6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nBeef is ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate, rocked with the\r\nseasoning five to ten minutes, when the pork trimmings are added and\r\nthe whole chopped fifteen to twenty minutes. This is a coarse sausage,\r\nabout the same as “Farmers” sausage. It is well to mix the meat\r\nthoroughly by hand after it has been rocked, or to mix it carefully\r\nwith a mixer. A “Stallman” mixer is better than a “Zimmerman” for\r\nfarmer sausage and coarse chopped summer sausage. However, the teeth in\r\na “Zimmerman” mixer can be reversed so that it will not tear the meat,\r\nas it otherwise does.\r\n\r\nAfter the meat has been chopped it is removed to a cooler for the same\r\nperiod as farmer sausage before stuffing. It is stuffed in either beef\r\nmiddles or hog bungs. After stuffing, the sausage is handled the same\r\nas Italian salami, except that it is wrapped with hitches same as\r\nD’Arles sausage, there being only about one-half the number.\r\n\r\nThis sausage can be very lightly smoked, but it is preferable to dry\r\nit the same as D’Arles and Italian sausage. If stuffed in beef middles\r\nit should be handled the same as farmer except that it is wrapped with\r\nstring about the same number of hitches as salami in hog bungs. The\r\nmajority of manufacturers smoke Italian salami in beef casings a very\r\nlittle, usually about twelve hours with as little smoke as possible.\r\nThis is done to prevent sliming, as it is difficult to air-dry\r\nbeef-middle sausage without the very best conveniences, or dry rooms\r\nwhere it can be hung apart from other sausage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hungarian Style Salami._--The formula for this sausage is as follows:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n  90 pounds lean pork trimmings,\r\n  35 pounds beef chucks trimmed free from sinews,\r\n  25 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   1¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper,\r\n   1 ounce garlic,\r\n   5¹⁄₂ ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nThe beef chucks are ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate.\r\nThe shoulder fat is shaved into thin pieces and both the beef and the\r\nfat, with the seasoning, are rocked seven to ten minutes, when the\r\npork trimmings are added, and the whole is rocked from eighteen to\r\ntwenty-two minutes. This is a moderately coarse sausage, about the same\r\nas Milanese salami.\r\n\r\nAfter the meat is rocked it is handled in the cooler the same as other\r\nsummer sausage and stuffed into extra large beef middle ends, which\r\nare, when stuffed, twenty-two to twenty-six inches long and weigh from\r\ntwelve to twenty pounds each.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be taken in stuffing this sausage to stuff it tightly\r\nand two or three lengths of string should be run from the large to the\r\nsmall end and vice versa, so as to prevent it from breaking, also to\r\nkeep it straight, and it should be hung, of course, the small end down.\r\n\r\nThis sausage is allowed to hang, before being put in the smoke house,\r\nthree or four days in a dry atmosphere, and then smoked over a cold\r\nsmoke at a temperature the same as for cervelat in beef middles,\r\nfor from fifty-five to sixty hours. Handle after smoking the same\r\nas cervelat in beef casings. It usually takes, under favorable\r\ncircumstances, sixty to seventy days before the sausage is ready for\r\nshipment.\r\n\r\nThis sausage is used extensively in Germany and Austria and there is\r\nsome of it used in Pennsylvania. There is not a very general demand for\r\nit in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thuringer Style Salami._--Formula for this sausage is as follows:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n  30 pounds extra lean beef chucks, trimmed free from sinews,\r\n  90 pounds fresh pork blade or shoulder meat, trimmed free from sinews,\r\n  30 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n   5 pounds salt,\r\n   1 ounce garlic,\r\n   3¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper,\r\n   6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nBeef is ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate and rocked with\r\nthe fat and seasoning, the fat having been cut into small pieces and\r\nshaved. Rock from seven to ten minutes, when the pork trimmings are\r\nadded and the whole is chopped eighteen to twenty-two minutes.\r\n\r\nThis sausage is rocked about as coarse as Milanese salami. After it is\r\nrocked it is handled in the cooler the same as other summer sausage\r\nand stuffed in large calf bladders which have been soaked a short time\r\nbefore stuffing so that they will be pliable. Care must be taken in\r\nstuffing this sausage to fill the bladders as full as possible. Use a\r\nskewer, also a string hanger.\r\n\r\nAllow it to hang two or three days before smoking, in a moderately\r\ncool temperature (50° to 55° F.), where there is no draft, and smoke\r\nover a cold smoke for forty-eight hours, the same as Braunschweiger,\r\nand Gothair, the sausage being hung near the top of the smoke house. Do\r\nnot smoke at the same time with any other sausage.\r\n\r\nUnless care is taken in smoking, the bladders will come out wrinkled,\r\nwhich spoils the appearance and consequently the sale of the sausage.\r\nHang in the dry room with beef middle cervelat and handle in every\r\nrespect the same. This sausage is usually ready for shipment in forty\r\nto fifty days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mortadella Style Sausage._--This sausage is made by the following\r\nformula:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n  135 pounds absolutely fresh lean trimmings,\r\n   15 pounds fresh lean beef chucks,\r\n   10 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n    5 pounds salt,\r\n    1¹⁄₂ ounces saltpetre,\r\n    2¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper.\r\n\r\nAdditional wet seasoning is used for this sausage, therefore it is\r\nadvisable to chop it six blocks at a time and mix by hand in a large\r\ntruck the seasoning must be added immediately after the meat has been\r\nchopped. For six blocks use:\r\n\r\n  3¹⁄₂ quarts strong imported French red wine,\r\n   ¹⁄₄-pound package pure white gelatine,\r\n  8    nutmegs,\r\n  1    ounce whole cloves,\r\n  3    ounces stick cinnamon,\r\n  4¹⁄₂ ounces bay leaves,\r\n  2¹⁄₂ ounces split coriander.\r\n\r\nPrepare this seasoning same as D’Arles sausage, then mix the wet\r\nseasoning with the meat in a truck. Scatter through it twelve ounces\r\nof whole white pepper and two ounces of coriander. The beef is ground\r\nthrough an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate and chopped on the block with\r\nthe dry seasoning for seven to ten minutes, when the pork trimmings\r\nare added and the whole chopped thirty to thirty-five minutes. This is\r\na very fine sausage. After the meat has been chopped mix the shoulder\r\nfat, which is cut into the shape of small dice (same as for D’Arles\r\nsausage), with the meat and mix in the wet seasoning at the same time.\r\n\r\nRemove to a cooler and allow it to stand from twelve to twenty-four\r\nhours, then stuff into medium-sized beef bladders which must be soaked\r\nin lukewarm water a few moments before they are stuffed, in order to\r\nmake them pliable, and care must be taken to stuff them as tightly as\r\npossible. Skewer, as well as tie them, and also wrap immediately with\r\nheavy coarse flax twine, making about two wraps the long way to the\r\nbladder and one wrap around the center, the twine terminating in a\r\nhanger. This sausage must not be hung by tied end or by the same string\r\nthat the bladder is tied with, for in such case they will fall in the\r\nsmoke house, or when drying.\r\n\r\nHang for twelve hours after stuffing in a hot smoke house with more\r\nheat than smoke at a temperature of about 90° F.; then cook in clear\r\nwater for four hours at a temperature of 150° F.; wash off thoroughly\r\nwith boiling water when taken from the cooking vat and hang them up in\r\na moderately cool place or dry room where the temperature is about 48°\r\nto 50° F. They will be ready to ship in four or five days.\r\n\r\nThis sausage can be smoked sufficiently heavy, so that cooking is\r\nunnecessary if proper facilities are available in smoke house. The\r\nhouse should be arranged with steam coils so that a temperature as high\r\nas 150° F. can be obtained during the process of smoking. This really\r\nis the most satisfactory way of handling this sausage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lyon Style Sausage._--For this sausage the following formula is used:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n  120 pounds extra lean selected pork trimmings, pork blade meat being\r\n      preferred, trimmed free from sinews,\r\n   20 pounds extra lean beef chucks, trimmed free from sinews,\r\n   10 pounds shoulder fat,\r\n    5 pounds salt,\r\n    2¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper,\r\n    1 ounce whole pepper,\r\n    1¹⁄₂ ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to use an additional wet seasoning for this sausage;\r\nat least six blocks should be chopped so as to mix properly and the\r\nseasoning must be added immediately after chopping. For six blocks Lyon\r\nsausage use the same formula for wet seasoning as for Milanese salami,\r\nand prepare in the same way. Grind the beef through a ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate\r\nand chop first on the block with the dry seasoning for seven to ten\r\nminutes when pork trimmings are added and the whole chopped thirty to\r\nthirty-five minutes. This is a very fine chopped sausage. After the\r\nbeef and pork have been rocked the wet seasoning and shoulder fat,\r\nwhich has been previously cut into the shape of small dice, are mixed\r\nwith it thoroughly by hand.\r\n\r\nThe meat is then taken to a cooler for the same period as D’Arles or\r\nMilanese salami, when it is stuffed by a hand stuffer into No. 1 hog\r\nbungs free from fat, and hung in a dry room where the temperature is\r\nabout 50° F., and where it can be kept entirely separate from other\r\nsausage, with plenty of air and no draft. After it has hung for\r\nthirty-six to forty-eight hours and the casings are moderately dry,\r\nwrap the sausage with No. 4 flax twine, both lengthwise and around so\r\nas to form a mesh about ¹⁄₂-inch square. It is handled the same as\r\nD’Arles or Milanese salami.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gothair Style Sausage._--This sausage is made according to the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\nFORMULA.\r\n\r\n   20 pounds extra lean beef chucks free from sinews,\r\n  110 pounds extra lean pork trimmings free from sinews,\r\n   20 pounds pork shoulder fat,\r\n    5 pounds salt,\r\n    3¹⁄₂ ounces white pepper,\r\n    6 ounces saltpetre.\r\n\r\nThe beef is ground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate and together\r\nwith the shoulder fat, which has been shaved as thin as possible and\r\ncut into the shape of small dice, is mixed in mixer with the seasoning\r\nfor from seven to ten minutes, when the pork trimmings are added and\r\nthe whole chopped for thirty to thirty-five minutes, after which it\r\nis taken to a cooler and handled the same as other summer sausage.\r\nIt is stuffed into short No. 1 lean hog bungs, or bungs that are\r\nfree from fat. This sausage is handled in every respect the same as\r\ncervelat sausage, except smoking. It should be smoked lightly with\r\nthe same temperature and same relative position in the smoke house as\r\nBraunschweiger sausage and about the same length of time. It is handled\r\nafter smoking, in the dry room, same as Braunschweiger.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lehigh Valley Style Summer Sausage._--This sausage is made from lean\r\nbull chucks, the meat being ground through an Enterprise one-quarter\r\ninch plate, then reground through an Enterprise ⁷⁄₆₄th-inch plate and\r\nrocked on a rocker for fifteen minutes. The seasoning is mixed on the\r\nrocker and is as follows for 100 pounds of meat:\r\n\r\nSEASONING FORMULA.\r\n\r\n   ¹⁄₃ pound fine salt,\r\n  1¹⁄₂ ounces saltpetre,\r\n  4 ounces saltpetre,\r\n  5 ounces mace,\r\n  1 ounce ground cloves,\r\n  2 ounces allspice,\r\n  4 ounces black pepper,\r\n  6 ounces coriander,\r\n  1 ounce sugar.\r\n\r\nAfter it is chopped it is put into a “Zimmerman” mixer and mixed for\r\nabout five minutes. It is then taken to a cooler and spread on tables\r\nmade for the purpose, about eight or ten inches thick, and allowed to\r\nremain for about three days, when it is stuffed into beef bungs, sack\r\npieces being preferable. After it is allowed to stand in a temperature\r\nof 48° F. until the casings become moderately dry, it is hung in a\r\nsmoke house and smoked for ten days or two weeks, at a temperature\r\nof between 50° and 60° F. Great care should be taken in smoking this\r\narticle, as it requires but a light smoke.\r\n\r\nAfter it is taken from the smoke house, it is hung in a dry room, where\r\na temperature of 48° to 50° F. can be maintained, and where the sausage\r\ncan be kept perfectly dry. This sausage takes from two to three months\r\nto dry thoroughly, and sometimes longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nBUTTERINE\r\n\r\n\r\n  INGREDIENTS -- COLORS -- EQUIPMENT -- ROOMS -- ARRANGEMENT -- TESTING\r\n  MILK -- ACIDITY -- MILK IN BUTTERINE -- REASONS FOR CULTURE -- CREAM\r\n  RIPENESS -- WATER VS. BRINE -- MILK NOT PASTEURIZED -- PREPARATORY\r\n  CULTURE -- STARTERS -- CULTIVATING THE MILK -- LOW GRADE BUTTERINE --\r\n  GRAINING -- WORKING THE BUTTERINE -- BUTTERINE PACKING -- HIGH-GRADE\r\n  BUTTERINE -- CLEANLINESS -- USE OF COLOR -- FORMULAS -- COSTS OF\r\n  BUTTERINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Introductory.=--Butterine is a product possessing value as food and\r\nplaces within the reach of the masses an article which is wholesome,\r\npalatable and moderate in price. National and state legislation has\r\ndone much to curtail its sale since it was found to be a competitor of\r\nthe dairyman and farmer. The restrictions in force limit the volume of\r\nbusiness, but the consumption is increasing.\r\n\r\nMost of the oleo oil made is shipped to Europe, where it is used in\r\nthe manufacture of butterine. With the comparatively dense population\r\nof European countries they are unable to supply themselves with dairy\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nWhile prejudice exists in many places against butterine, it is\r\nwholesome, as it is made in a cleanly manner, for if it is not made\r\nwith absolute cleanliness, and if the ingredients are in the least\r\ntainted from any cause, the whole mass is injured. This is true to\r\na greater extent than it is in the manufacture of pure butter, and\r\nmore marked in butterine. Considerable progress has been made in the\r\nmanufacture of this article within the past few years, and a more\r\ndesirable product has been made since neutral lard has been used as an\r\ningredient. It is, however, necessary to use milk or cream or butter to\r\ngive the goods the flavor, and many manufacturers use a percentage of\r\nthe highest quality creamery butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ingredients.=--The ingredients of butterine are butter, milk, cream,\r\noleo oil, neutral lard, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, and palm oil. The\r\nlatter two being comparatively new compounds. These, together with salt\r\nmake the butterine of commerce. The manufacture of oleo oil, neutral\r\nlard, and a description of cotton seed oil is described in previous\r\nchapters, although the cottonseed oil used is usually bought ready\r\nprepared and known to the trade as “Butter” oil, peanut oil and palm\r\noil are standard articles of commerce of varying qualities, and are\r\nusually bought on sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Colors.=--There are three standard qualities of color in butterine.\r\nWhite goods, tested goods, and colored goods, in which an artificial\r\ncolor is used, with due acknowledgement and the payment of ten cents\r\nper pound tax. The production of butterine is closely supervised by\r\nthe Federal Government of the United States, with scrupulous care and\r\nexactness, particularly as to any attempt to produce a color resembling\r\nthat of butter. At least ten per cent of the quantity of any given\r\ningredient must be used as a constituent or component part. There are,\r\nfor instance, many vegetable oils, that would be considered edible\r\nbut of high color, the introduction of a relatively small amount of\r\nwhich would help to produce the yellow color of butter. Objection\r\nis not made to their uses, but ten per cent of the quantity must be\r\nused in the formulas, and this quantity is usually prohibited for the\r\nreason that the pungency or some peculiarity of the foreign oil makes\r\nit undesirable in butterine. The manufacturer must closely watch his\r\npurchases of product to see they are not artificially colored since the\r\nintroduction of any coloring substance in cottonseed or peanut oil, for\r\nexample, would react upon the manufacturer of the butterine.\r\n\r\nIt is best not to attempt any innovations in making butterine without\r\nconsulting the Federal authorities so as to be sure you are within the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Equipment.=--The equipment required in the manufacture of butterine\r\nis a comparatively simple outfit, consisting of the following items\r\nenumerated in the order of their use in the making of the product.\r\n\r\n  Storage tanks for cottonseed oil received in carload lots.\r\n\r\n  Storage tanks within the building for containing oils for immediate\r\n  use.\r\n\r\n  Oleo oil melting kettles for reducing oleo oil to a fluid state.\r\n\r\n  “Starter” cans in which the milk culture is kept and developed ready\r\n  for use in the cream ripener.\r\n\r\n  “Ripeners” for milk and cream for pasteurizing and propagating\r\n  culture in milk preparatory for churning.\r\n\r\n  “Emulsion” churns in which the various ingredients are mixed.\r\n\r\n  Flume type crystalizers.\r\n\r\n  Tempering trucks.\r\n\r\n  Butter Workers.\r\n\r\n  Packing tables where prints and tubs are packed.\r\n\r\n  Print trucks for setting prints after making.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rooms.=--The factory is necessarily divided into several rooms,\r\nnotably:\r\n\r\n  (a) One in which the milk receiving, testing, weighing, pasteurizing\r\n  and ripening is performed.\r\n\r\n  (b) One in which--temperature 70° F.--the oil and melting facilities\r\n  are arranged.\r\n\r\n  (c) The tempering room in which the butterine is tempered after\r\n  crystalizing. The temperature 58° to 60° F.\r\n\r\n  (d) The packing room where prints are made. Temperatures 40° to 45° F.\r\n\r\n  (e) The storage cooler where prints are set up before boxing and\r\n  after boxed. Temperatures 34° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Arrangement.=--In the usual arrangement butterine factories are\r\ndesigned so that the work begins on an upper floor and terminates on\r\na shipping floor. The extent of the factory and the space allotted to\r\neach operation depending upon the volume of business. Usually decks\r\nare introduced upon which part of the work is performed. Local pumps,\r\nreadily cleansed, are used for transfer of materials via pipes, and\r\nthese are arranged with flow toward outlet so as to admit of perfect\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Testing the Milk.=--Consider the methods of receiving the milk,\r\nand also making proper tests to determine its value and the amount\r\nof fat it contains. It is very essential this be done carefully and\r\nintelligently, as the result of the test determines the value of the\r\nproduct purchased. Milk and cream are frequently paid for on the butter\r\nfat percentage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--EMULSION CHURN.]\r\n\r\nThe test generally accepted is obtained by using Babcock’s “Acme” steam\r\nturbine test machine. This machine is made to accommodate twenty-four\r\nbottles. The machine should be set up well, secured and balanced\r\nperfectly for each test. This is accomplished by placing bottles\r\nexactly opposite each other. Should a test be desired on only one\r\nsample of milk, fill a bottle with water and place in machine opposite\r\nsample. The machine in motion makes 3,000 revolutions per minute. It\r\nwill, therefore, be seen that equilibrium is necessary. Test bottles\r\nare arranged so they will contain the amount of milk or cream and acid\r\nneeded. A 17.6 cc. pipette is used for measuring the milk or cream and\r\na 17.6 cc. graduated tube for the acid. First pour 17.6 cc. milk in\r\nbottle, then pour in 17.6 cc. commercial grade sulphuric acid. Do not\r\ndrop the acid on top of the milk, but hold the bottles sidewise so that\r\nthe acid will slip into the milk at side. Otherwise a burnt taste will\r\nresult and make it impossible to correctly read the test. Shake the\r\nbottle well until milk has entirely disappeared, then place in machine.\r\n\r\nAfter bottles are filled in this manner the machine balanced, steam is\r\nadmitted gradually, increasing until machine is running at full speed.\r\nAllow to run five minutes, then stop, fill each bottle with hot water\r\nup to the lowest mark on graduate neck of bottle; start machine again\r\nand allow it to run for three minutes, when again it will be necessary\r\nto add hot water up to within one-half inch of top of neck of bottle;\r\nrun machine two minutes longer, and read test. Use a pair of compasses\r\nin reading the fat in neck of bottle and read it quickly, as the fat\r\nrecedes if left long. This test determines the percentage of fat in\r\nsample of milk, consequently its comparative value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.--BUTTERINE TRUCK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Acidity.=--The “sourness” or acidity of the milk can be determined by\r\ntaste or smell, but not accurately. A test is necessary to determine\r\nthe exact condition of the milk when purchased.\r\n\r\nWhen milk contains six-tenths of one per cent acid, the most desirable\r\npoint has been reached, as then it imparts the best flavor to the\r\ngoods. If more than six-tenths of one per cent acid is used the flavor\r\nis not as good. This is also the case if a lower percentage of acidity\r\nis used. Hence the milk or cream should be brought to this exact degree\r\nof sourness before using.\r\n\r\nTo determine this accurately, it is necessary to do it by a test, as\r\nmilk may be three-tenths of one per cent acid before it is perceptible\r\nto the taste or smell. Milk that would pass as sweet by taste or smell\r\nwill show two-tenths of one per cent acid.\r\n\r\nThe test to determine this is simple. Any chemist is able to furnish\r\nall alkali solution and the necessary neutralizer of proper strength.\r\nThe usual way, however, is to use what is known as Farrington’s\r\ntablets, prepared by Prof. Farrington of the Wisconsin Dairy School.\r\nThese tablets are dissolved in water, a convenient strength being five\r\ntablets to fifty cubic centimeters of water. The solution is mixed\r\nwith the milk to be tested and shaken; the acid in the milk acting\r\nupon the alkali of the solution immediately turns the milk to a pink\r\ncolor and the amount of the solution required to produce the pink color\r\ndetermines the acidity of the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Milk in Butterine.=--Cleanliness is the all-important factor, since\r\nmilk is easily contaminated by foreign flavors and germ life. Milk\r\nreadily absorbs the odors given off by articles placed in the same\r\nroom. Only pure and absolutely sweet milk and cream should be used,\r\nbut as absolutely pure milk, though sweet, is difficult to secure, it\r\nbecomes necessary to adopt some method whereby the condition of such\r\nmilk can be righted.\r\n\r\nCareless milkers care little whether hair, dirt, dust, etc., drop into\r\nthe pails while milking, thinking that in straining the milk, all\r\nparticles and impurities are removed. It does remove most particles,\r\nbut the germs which were clinging to these particles are not strained\r\nout. They remain in the milk and under favorable temperatures thrive\r\nand multiply unless arrested.\r\n\r\nWhen the milk has been tested and accepted it should be strained\r\nthrough several thicknesses of clean cloth into the ripening machine,\r\nbringing the temperature in the different vats to the same point, so\r\nthat as the milk is used it will all be in the same condition. In cold\r\nweather the temperature should be held at 70° F., while during the\r\nwarmer seasons from 60° to 65° is desirable. In cloudy, murky summer\r\nweather a lower temperature will be required. Under such conditions the\r\ntemperature should be held at from 55° to 60° F. until the storm is\r\npassed, when it should again be held at the normal temperature named.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Reasons for Culture.=--To make an acidity test, a 20 cc. pipette is\r\nused for measuring the milk or cream. Each cubic centimeter of solution\r\nis equal to two one-hundredths of one per cent acid, hence if 10 cc. of\r\nsolution is necessary to turn the milk or cream a pink color, the milk\r\nwould contain just two-tenths of one per cent acid and would be sweet.\r\nAny more than that would show the milk too sour for use. In receiving\r\nsweet milk, it must be assumed to contain impure bacteria, which only\r\nawait the proper temperature to develop and sour the milk, producing\r\nbad flavors. It must be neutralized by pasteurizing and then cultivated\r\nwith pure bacteria.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage obtained in the use of the “starter” is, that\r\nit permits the ripening of milk and cream at low temperatures.\r\nBacteriologists state, and it is proved by experience, that a\r\ntemperature of about 65° F. is most favorable to the development\r\nof the best fermentation in ripening milk and cream. Prior to\r\nthe use of cultures it was customary to sour the milk at a much\r\nhigher temperature, which was correspondingly favorable to all the\r\nobjectionable bacteria in the milk. Without the use of the “starter”\r\nthe conditions were beyond the control of the operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cream Ripeners.=--To produce these conditions the milk should\r\nbe pasteurized, which can be performed by the use of a standard\r\npasteurizer of the type shown in Fig. 164. There are a variety of\r\npasteurizers in use.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus is equipped with an internal revolving coil of pipe or\r\ndiscs, built sufficiently strong to withstand the pressure of steam,\r\nwater or brine circulated through the coils or discs, which is usually\r\ndone in the order named.\r\n\r\nTo pasteurize, the milk is heated to a temperature of 180° F. for\r\ntwenty minutes. This practically destroys the bacteria present. The\r\nmilk is then rapidly cooled by passing cold water or chilled brine, or\r\nboth, in turn, through the coil to reduce the temperature of the body\r\nquickly to that desired, usually 55° to 70° F., according to conditions\r\nas described. The starter or culture is introduced and the milk\r\nagitated to insure a thorough intermingling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.--WIZARD PASTEURIZER AND RIPENER, STYLE B WITH\r\nVITRIFIED PORCELAIN ENAMELED JACKET AND “SIDE LIFT” PIANO HINGE METAL\r\nCOVER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water Versus Brine.=--Where an abundant supply of cold water is\r\navailable cream ripeners are arranged so that the first cooling is done\r\nby cold water passing through the chilling coil, since much cooling\r\ncan be done in this manner. The work is completed by cold brine. It is\r\nbest not to attempt this unless the volume of business is sufficient to\r\njustify intelligent supervision on the ripeners, because if it is done,\r\nsome means such as compressed air must be attached to the coil in the\r\nripener for the purpose of flowing out the water before admitting brine\r\nas the mixing would reduce the brine to a point where it would freeze\r\non the brine coils or in the double pipe ammonia brine coolers with\r\ndisastrous results.\r\n\r\nIn providing brine cooling capacity ample volume should be arranged for\r\n“reserve or inertia” since the demand is insistent and large in a short\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Milk not Pasteurized.=--Some manufacturers do not pasteurize the milk\r\nand conduct operations as described in the following paragraphs.\r\nHowever, the acidity test is equally applicable in either system.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Milk and Cream._--Only sweet milk should be used. Milk\r\nthat is sour before reaching the factory causes troubles impossible\r\nto remedy, and no matter how good the “starter” the milk will have\r\ndeveloped bacteria that cannot be destroyed; and, as the milk or cream\r\nbecomes older the development of the proper bacteria is impossible to\r\ncontrol. This is as true after it has been worked into the butterine\r\nas before. Hence it will be seen, that a great deal depends upon the\r\nmilk and cream being sweet in developing proper conditions with the\r\n“starter.”\r\n\r\nThe milk upon being received is passed to the ripener, the temperature\r\nreduced as desired, and the process of “starter” is followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=What are Starters?=--The “starters” referred to are cultures--the\r\nbacteria found in clean, fresh milk, cultivated in vast numbers and\r\nwhen incorporated in milk containing an impure variety, miniature\r\nwarfare is at once begun. If the “starter” is right, the warfare ends\r\nwith the pure germs victorious.\r\n\r\nThere are two ferments or “starters” on the market which are\r\ncommendable on account of their uniformity and purity. They are\r\nproduced in laboratories, every care being taken to see that no foreign\r\ngerms come in contact with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparatory Cultures.=--Into a commercial starter can put four gallons\r\nof sweet, skimmed milk, which tests two-tenths of one per cent acid, no\r\nmore. Strain through a double thickness of perfectly clean cloth, heat\r\nthe milk to 180° F., holding at this temperature for one-half hour.\r\nThis “Pasteurizes” the milk by killing all life in it. It also destroys\r\nall flavor.\r\n\r\nThe milk should be cooled quickly to 90° F. As soon as this temperature\r\nhas been reached pour in a four-ounce bottle of “starter” or culture,\r\nholding the bottle close to the milk so as to avoid contamination.\r\nThe bottle should not be opened until ready for use. After adding\r\nthe ferment cool down slowly to 70° F., stirring all the while so as\r\nto thoroughly mix the milk. The bacteria grow very rapidly at this\r\ntemperature. In twelve hours, if kept evenly at this temperature in a\r\ntightly closed vessel, a sufficient quantity of the proper germs will\r\nhave been developed to produce an acidity of five-tenths of one per\r\ncent. The milk will also have thickened somewhat. If the conditions are\r\nfound at the termination of twelve hours, cool the milk quickly to 40°\r\nF. and hold at this temperature until ready to make a large “starter.”\r\n\r\nIf the milk has not grown sufficient germs to produce the above named\r\nacidity, that is, five-tenths of one per cent, reheat to 90° F. and\r\nhold at this temperature until it does. Do not stir it at this stage,\r\nas the “starter” should be kept with as little agitation as possible\r\nafter the germs have been propagated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Regular “Starter”.=--When ready to make the factory “starter,”\r\nplace twenty gallons of sweet, skimmed milk in a sterilizer, after\r\nhaving cleaned the vessel, and heat as before to 180° F.; hold at this\r\ntemperature for one-half hour, then chill to 70° F. and add the four\r\ngallons of preparatory “starter” already described, stirring well while\r\nadding.\r\n\r\nLet this stand twelve hours as before in a temperature of 70° F., when\r\nit should appear as the preparatory starter did, slightly thickened and\r\nshowing an acidity of five-tenths of one per cent. When acidity test\r\nshows this to have been reached, chill to 40° F. (at this temperature\r\nthe bacteria are dormant and will not develop), and hold until ready to\r\nripen the day’s run of milk and cream for churning.\r\n\r\nWhen the milk has been brought in the ripeners to the proper\r\ntemperature, distribute the larger “starter” evenly through it. Three\r\nper cent is sufficient during the summer months, while even as high as\r\nten per cent is necessary in cold weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cultivating the Milk.=--Put the requisite amount of factory “starter”\r\nin the ripeners, thoroughly agitate and allow to remain quiet. At the\r\nexpiration of twelve hours, the milk should be ripened sufficiently for\r\nchurning and by test it should show, as above stated, six-tenths of one\r\nper cent acid. When this acidity has been developed cool to 58° F. and\r\nplace in churn. At this temperature the butter-fat will form in small,\r\nfirm globules and separate nicely from the casein. If the temperature\r\nis lower than this it takes much longer to separate the fat from the\r\ncasein and it is impossible to separate all of it, hence some fat is\r\nlost. At a higher temperature, the fat, when separate, will be fluffy\r\nand soft and will not produce a firm body.\r\n\r\nAs texture is one of the essential points to be sought after in\r\nproducing artificial butter, the churning of the milk, in order to\r\nproduce the proper texture in the butter-fat, is a very important\r\nfunction and one which should be carefully performed. Before putting\r\nthe milk into the churn it should be stirred thoroughly, as during the\r\ntwelve hours occupied in ripening, the butter-fat, being the lightest,\r\nhas come to the top and unless again thoroughly mixed, one churn will\r\ncontain most of the fat and the others will contain comparatively\r\nlittle, and as each churning of milk going into the mixer constitutes a\r\nseparate run, the quality of the butterine manufactured will be uneven.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quality in Butterine.=--Butterine is made in various grades, differing\r\nin constituents and proportions, also color, according to selections.\r\nSome manufacturers reduce the milk and cream content and add pure\r\nbutter. Formulas for various methods follow:\r\n\r\nIn the matter of color large oleo producers select fats in the raw\r\nfor making high colored oil, keeping it separate in manufacture; also\r\nselect oil while graining for color, and press it all separately.\r\nAnother source of a high colored oil is the boiling of large knuckles\r\nfrom shank or leg bones in cutter cattle, cooking them in open tanks\r\nand skimming the oil. The bones are cracked and boiled several times\r\nand the oil skimmed. The flavor is not sufficient to be detrimental.\r\nThis is purely an animal oil that can be used in the oleo oil to make\r\ntinted mixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Low Grade Butterine.=--This is composed of cotton seed oil, No. 2 oleo\r\noil and No. 2 neutral lard. Straight milk is used for flavor. The oils\r\ngo into an emulsion churn at the following temperatures: Cotton seed\r\noil at 75° F.; neutral lard, added next, at 95° F., and oleo oil next\r\nat 90° F.\r\n\r\nThe cotton seed oil should be agitated for about fifteen to twenty\r\nminutes before the other oils are added, leaving the lid of the\r\nemulsion churn open. This has the effect of removing some of the\r\nflavor from the oil and while it may be slight, it is an advantage.\r\nThe neutral lard should be added next, care being taken to see that it\r\nis free from flakes and grainy mixtures. In other words, it should be\r\nbrought to the proper temperature, viz., 95° F. and held there long\r\nenough before going to the agitator to be sure that the grain of the\r\nlard has entirely disappeared, for if this is allowed to go in it can\r\nnever be removed in the finished product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.--CHURN ROOM FOR BUTTERINE.]\r\n\r\nThe oleo oil is next added and after these three ingredients have been\r\nagitated for twenty minutes and thoroughly mixed, the milk should be\r\nadded last and the whole mass left in the agitator for five minutes\r\nwith the lid closed tightly.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the salt and color are added, if color is used. The\r\namount of salt required should be decided by the necessities of the\r\nparticular trade to be supplied, but 5 per cent will be found a medium\r\nsalting. Experience is that it is better to add salt at this time\r\nbecause it is more evenly distributed in the emulsion than in the\r\ngranular butterine.\r\n\r\nAfter the color and salt are thoroughly mixed, let the whole body run\r\ninto the graining vat filled with water at a temperature of 40° F.\r\n\r\nThe oils and milk will show a temperature of about 90° F. as a whole.\r\nIf not, heat to that point before drawing into the graining vat. This\r\nshould be drawn through a 5-inch galvanized pipe flattened out at the\r\nend to form a spreading exit for the butterine. The butterine passes\r\ninto the water vat directly behind a paddle wheel arranged so that\r\none-half of it is above water. The wheel revolves rapidly causing the\r\nbutterine to be quickly submerged, thereby graining it as fast as it\r\nhits the cold water. The quicker butterine is grained, the more flavor\r\nit retains, as the globules formed increase the flavor. Should the\r\nwater be too cold, the butterine will be hard and dry, and is likely to\r\ncrumble and mottle, besides causing a reduction in gain. On the other\r\nhand, if the water is too warm the butterine will be soft and mushy and\r\ncannot be worked properly, although the gain will be larger. Warm water\r\nis used on very cheap grades when butterine is to be packed in solids\r\nand a large gain is desired. As fast as the butterine to be grained\r\nshows on the top of the water, it should be lifted onto a cloth in the\r\nhands of two men to a clean box truck.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sluice Trough.=--Many factories have discarded the graining vat and\r\nprovided a sluice trough, being a trough into which the contents\r\nare passed from the emulsion churn. Water is introduced, thoroughly\r\nintermingled with the oils and performing an instantaneous chilling.\r\nThe sluice trough is arranged with slats in the bottom at intervals so\r\nas to produce the effect of ripples. It flows directly to the seeding\r\ntrucks, where as with the graining vat, it was dipped and poured onto\r\nthe graining trucks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Graining or Tempering.=--The butterine should then be covered with a\r\nsprinkling of fine salt and the trucks placed in the tempering room,\r\nwhere a temperature of 60° F. should be maintained, to remain twelve\r\nhours. In this time, it will develop all the flavor it is possible to\r\nobtain and be ready for the workers.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the tempering room is something that must be watched\r\ncarefully and should never be allowed to go above 60° F. as the\r\ningredients in this condition contain a large amount of water, and at a\r\nwarmer temperature action of the water and grease are liable to cause\r\nthe goods to sour.\r\n\r\nMilk and cream undergo many changes after being incorporated in the\r\nfinished butterine and the more cream there is in the product the lower\r\nthe temperature in the tempering room should be. It is not at this\r\nstage that flavor is made. Only the flavor the product already contains\r\nis developed and many batches of sour or “off” butterine are traced to\r\ntoo warm tempering rooms, whereby the butter fat and oil because of\r\ntheir mixture with water decompose and become rancid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.--MAKING BUTTERINE PRINTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Working.=--Butterine differs from creamery butter, in that the\r\nbutter-fat and casein are both used in the butterine, whereas in\r\ncreamery butter the fat alone is utilized. This is done in butterine\r\nto gain all the flavor possible by passing the buttermilk through\r\nthe oils. It is later washed out in the water vats, but in passing\r\nthrough the oils, it imparts some flavor. Butterine also requires much\r\nless working, thereby avoiding a “salvey” or pasty condition, also\r\npreventing a loss of moisture and increasing the yield of the article.\r\nSalt being the primary cause of the “mottle” or discoloration, that\r\ndanger is also avoided when goods are not over-worked.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in the tempering room twelve hours the butterine is\r\ntaken out to the workers. It should be worked as little as possible\r\nto obtain a smooth, compact body, as over-working produces a “salvey”\r\ncondition. A very successful butter worker is illustrated in Fig. 167.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.--BUTTERINE KNEADING TABLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Butterine Packing.=--From the worker the butterine is transferred to\r\nthe print making or packing room. In packing the product is worked up\r\ninto prints or rolls, or packed solid into tubs, as the case may be,\r\nand should be run into a cooler kept at a temperature of from 32° to\r\n35° F., and there held twelve hours, at least, before being shipped.\r\nThis gives the butterine time to properly set. The prints are arranged\r\non trays to “set” before boxing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=High Grade Butterine.=--The formula for high grade butterine differs\r\nfrom low grade in that it does not contain cotton seed oil and that\r\ncream is used instead of straight milk. The oils are also treated in a\r\ndifferent manner and at different temperatures. Larger quantities of\r\ncream are used to improve the quality and grades. The treatment of\r\noils is the same in all high grades.\r\n\r\nThe neutral oil should be placed in the agitator first. Before being\r\nput in, however, it should be brought to a temperature of 110° F. or\r\nenough to remove the flakes and grain. Then cooled quickly with clear\r\nice, or by means of refrigeration, to 95° F. and run into the emulsion\r\nchurn, in motion, with the lids open. Oleo oil should be heated just\r\nenough to remove the grain and make it smooth, about 115° F., then\r\nchilled quickly to 85° F. and run into the agitator. Let it be agitated\r\nfive minutes and then add the cream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--BUTTERINE SOLID PACKING ROOM.]\r\n\r\nThe whole body is then agitated enough to insure mixture, ten minutes\r\nbeing sufficient, after which it is dropped into the graining vat,\r\nthe temperature of the water being 36° F. It should be removed from\r\nthe water into trucks at once and put into the tempering room at a\r\ntemperature not over 60° F., tempered twelve hours and worked the same\r\nas low grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cleanliness and Water Supply.=--Cleanliness of all utensils is\r\nvery important and live steam should be run through all pipes after\r\neach time they are used so that there is no possibility of any fats\r\nor grease adhering to the inside and becoming rancid, as it is\r\ncarelessness of this kind that often causes a large amount of trouble\r\nin a butterine factory. The use of clean, clear water is imperative.\r\nIf the ordinary supply is not so, it should be made thus by the use of\r\nlocal filtration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.--PRINT COOLER FOR BUTTERINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Use of Color.=--The reader will understand that this is the particular\r\npoint upon which federal restrictions have been placed, and the goods\r\ntoday cannot be colored except upon payment of a tax amounting to ten\r\ncents per pound. On uncolored goods the tax is one-quarter cent per\r\npound. While the goods are equally as wholesome uncolored as colored,\r\nthey are not as attractive and sales are proportionately curtailed.\r\n\r\nAfter the different ingredients have been thoroughly agitated in the\r\nmixer, the proper or desired coloring matter is added an article\r\nmanufactured especially for this purpose. From four to forty ounces\r\nto a batch of 100 pounds, according to the color and shade required,\r\nshould be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Formulas for Making Butterine.=--The following formulas show the\r\namount of different ingredients used and cost of finished product at\r\ntime tests were made.

It will be seen at a glance that the higher the temperature of\r\nthe water in the graining vat the greater the yield, and the lower the\r\ntemperature of the water the less the yield, although the texture of\r\nthe product is improved.\r\n\r\nThe high grade shrinks considerably less than the low grade. This is\r\nexplained in two ways. First there is very little loss of cream in the\r\nhigh grade, because one-third of the entire quantity of cream used in\r\nbutter fat, or solid matter. While in the low grade only one-sixth\r\nof the milk used is solid matter, and as the emulsion goes into the\r\ngraining vat the milk is lost in the water. Furthermore, cotton\r\nseed oil being absent from the high grade quality, the mass retains\r\nmore water, as cotton seed oil has little affinity for water at any\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nA less amount of salt was used in this particular test on the high\r\ngrade on account of the presence of salt in creamery butter used in\r\nthe formula. A careful perusal of the following table will prove\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\nTEST SHOWING SHRINKAGE AND COST OF BUTTERINE.\r\n\r\n  =================+=====+====+====+====+====+=====+======+====+\r\n                   |     |    |    |Cot-|    |     |      |    |\r\n                   |     |    |Neu-| ton|    |     |Cream-|    |\r\n                   |     |Oleo|tral|seed|    |     |  ery |    |\r\n                   |Temp.| oil| oil| oil|Milk|Cream|butter|Salt|\r\n                   |water|lbs.|lbs.|lbs.|lbs.| lbs.| lbs. |lbs.|\r\n      Butterine    |Fahr.| wt.| wt.| wt.| wt.|  wt.|  wt. | wt.|\r\n  -----------------+-----+----+----+----+----+-----+------+----|\r\n  Low grade        | 38° | 350| 450| 250| 450| ... |  ... | 60 |\r\n  Low grade        | 45° | 350| 450| 250| 450| ... |  ... | 60 |\r\n  Medium high grade| 40° | 525| 475| ...| ...| 300 |  ... | 60 |\r\n  High grade       | 40° | 525| 475| ...| ...| 225 |  300 | 50 |\r\n  -----------------+-----+----+----+----+----+-----+------+----+\r\n\r\n  =================+=====+=====+=====+=======+=======+======\r\n                   |     |     |     |       |       |\r\n                   |     |     |     |       |       |\r\n                   |     |     |     |Shrink-|Shrink-|Cost\r\n                   |Color|Total|Yield|  age  |  age  | per\r\n                   | oz. |lbs. | lbs.|  lbs. |  per  | 100\r\n      Butterine    | wt. | wt. |  wt.|   wt. | cent. |lbs.\r\n  -----------------+-----+-----+-----+-------+-------+------\r\n  Low grade        |  20 | 1560| 1210|  350  | .2243 |$ 7.82\r\n  Low grade        |  20 | 1560| 1290|  270  | .1730 |  7.36\r\n  Medium high grade|  20 | 1360| 1294|   66  | .0485 | 10.59\r\n  High grade       |  20 | 1575| 1497|   78  | .0495 | 14.29\r\n  -----------------+-----+-----+-----+-------+-------+------\r\n\r\nNote the excessive shrinkage where weight of milk is taken into\r\nconsideration with other ingredients used, the milk being lost in the\r\nchilling water and the flavor being retained. Where natural butter\r\nis used the shrinkage is much less.

Where they are used\r\nin such large numbers, it is very essential to have a box suitable\r\nfor the products which will be packed into it without waste of room,\r\nsufficiently strong to withstand handling in transit and at the same\r\ntime of minimum weight on account of freight charges.\r\n\r\nThe kind of lumber used for packing boxes varies in different\r\nlocalities. Cottonwood is the best and wherever available, should be\r\nused. The packing house industry has created a very important outlet\r\nfor this otherwise almost worthless wood. It has no natural flavor and\r\nis very desirable for lard, butterine boxes, etc. It is used for making\r\nthe small-sized packages into which lard is drawn direct instead of\r\nusing pails or tubs. Boxes for these purposes are usually dovetailed\r\nand have a sliding cover. Where cottonwood is not available white pine\r\nis used, although in this case it is necessary to use thicker lumber,\r\nwhich as a consequence makes the boxes heavier. The following list\r\ngives the kind of boxes, inside measurements, thickness of lumber in\r\nthe sides, top, bottom, ends and cleats, where necessary. The figures\r\nare applicable to cottonwood only:\r\n\r\nPORK PACKING BOXES.\r\n\r\n  ===========================+====================================+\r\n                             |                                    |\r\n                             |                                    |\r\n                             |                                    |\r\n                             |                                    +\r\n                             |                                    |\r\n                             |                                    |\r\n          Contents           |              Remarks               |\r\n  ---------------------------+------------------------------------+\r\n  500 lbs.

In such cases a good refrigerator box is made necessary in\r\nthe handling of the product to the trade--a box that will stand the\r\nabuse, wear and tear in shipping and at the same time one that is not\r\nexcessively heavy, adding unnecessarily to the express charges. The\r\ndimensions given below are for wooden boxes which are generally made\r\nof 1-inch clear pine lumber, the corners being securely fastened with\r\nangle iron, or with heavy galvanized iron, and the covers put on with\r\nspecially strong hinges as the boxes meet with a great deal of hard\r\nusage and when filled must necessarily be strong in order to withstand\r\nthe jar and strain.\r\n\r\nA galvanized iron box containing the meat is placed inside of the\r\nwooden box, leaving about two inches of space around it and four\r\ninches of space on top. The meat to be shipped is packed tightly into\r\nthe galvanized iron box, which is then placed in the wooden box and\r\nthe space around the sides and top filled with crushed ice. In this\r\ncondition meat will keep fresh in hot weather for from thirty-six to\r\nforty-eight hours under ordinary conditions.\r\n\r\nThe following dimensions are those generally in use for the different\r\nsized wooden boxes enumerated:\r\n\r\n    Capacity   Inside measure, inches\r\n   50 pounds   26 × 16¹⁄₂ × 9\r\n  100 pounds   24 × 18    × 14\r\n  100 pounds   26 × 18    × 13\r\n  200 pounds   34 × 18    × 18¹⁄₂\r\n  200 pounds   34 × 20    × 16\r\n  300 pounds   38 × 24    × 19\r\n  500 pounds   42 × 28    × 18¹⁄₂\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTAL ACCOUNTING\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEPARTMENTAL ACCOUNTING -- EXPENSE ACCOUNTS -- DEPARTMENTS --\r\n  PURCHASES -- INVENTORIES -- STORE ACCOUNTS -- LABOR CHARGED TO\r\n  DEPARTMENTS AND SUB-DIVISIONS -- GENERAL PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Why and How.=--The large packing houses are usually operated on a\r\ndepartmental basis, so that monthly or yearly, a balance can be drawn\r\noff showing the profit and loss of each department. There is a great\r\nadvantage in handling a large business in this manner, for it is\r\nprobable that while in the aggregate the house is making money, there\r\nmight be departments that are losing money continuously without being\r\ndetected unless each one is put on an individual basis.\r\n\r\nEach department is made a separate business carrying its proportion\r\nof the divisible expenses, buying the raw product and supplies going\r\ninto the manufacture and receiving credit for all sales effected in the\r\nsame manner as if owned by an individual and the business conducted at\r\nsome remote point. The raw material transferred from one department\r\nto another is charged. At the end of each period, or weekly, those in\r\ncharge, put a price on all the different products transferred from one\r\ndepartment to another, generally using the market price which could be\r\nobtained if sold outside.\r\n\r\nThis method of analysis frequently shows that the department has lost\r\nmoney. It may develop that some other manufacturer has developed a\r\nfield wherein he can pay a price for the raw product in excess of its\r\nvalue as used in the department and that it should be sold for cash\r\nrather than to use it for manufacturing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Expense Account.=--There are a number of expense accounts that\r\nare borne upon an allocation, that is, apportioned among several\r\ndepartments, perhaps by percentage of sales, units in use, tonnage or\r\nother means devised by the ingenuity of the accountant, all with a view\r\nto an equitable division. These embrace, for example, Steam-Expense,\r\nwhich, as its name implies, is the cost of producing steam subdivided\r\ninto four general uses,--cooking, power, lighting and refrigerating.\r\nEach made up of all items going into its cost. This provides a total of\r\nfour items.\r\n\r\nAdministrative or Executive Expenses embrace the cost of office,\r\ntelegraph, telephone, stationery, printing, advertising, insurance,\r\ninterest and all other items of general expense. There are also some\r\ngeneral plant expenses that are itemized for other purposes that may be\r\nincluded in this ledger account, or divided upon some basis and charged\r\nto the departmental ledger account.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Department.=--The parent products are cattle, sheep and hogs. These\r\nare subdivided into accounts about as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Cattle._            _Hogs._          _Sheep._\r\n  Beef                 Fresh Pork         Mutton\r\n  Hides                Sweet Pickle       Skins\r\n  Oleo                 Dry Salt\r\n  Casings              Lard Refining\r\n  Tallow               Sausage\r\n  Fertilizer           Smoke House\r\n  Bones\r\n  Tongue\r\n  Tripe and Pigs Feet\r\n  Beef Cutting\r\n  Beef Cellars\r\n  Veal\r\n\r\nWhere one subdivision, such as Tongue, embraces several kinds of\r\nproducts, like sheep, beef and pork, it is operated as one department\r\nand not further sub-divided. Usually the outside departments are\r\nseparated so that the departmental results are ascertainable. The\r\ndivisions are carried on indefinitely depending upon the size of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Purchases.=--All purchases of every nature that can be charged\r\ndirectly so are distributed from purchase vouchers. The departmental\r\nmanager and foreman have a direct interest in these and usually look\r\nout for all supplies and like expense items.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Inventories.=--An actual physical inventory is taken at the\r\nterminating date of each month or period, making a record of the\r\nitems of every nature on hand that is a liquid asset and not usually\r\nincluding interests which are charged off as an item of expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Store Account.=--To avoid duplication of purchases of material used,\r\nit is usual to have a general store in which these are carried and\r\ndispersed to operating departments on order. This store account usually\r\nincludes the distribution of mechanical labor, such as pipe fitters,\r\ncarpenters, machinists and labor of similar classes, being charged out\r\nto the department requiring their services.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Labor.=--Plant labor is a large item of the expense of manufacture\r\nand one that is controllable within measure by the management. There\r\nare certain standards of divisions recognized by practice and for\r\nsuch departments if the business be large it is well to have a weekly\r\nanalysis and a cost per unit developed. For a lesser business, monthly\r\nwill serve. This expense item keeps the departmental men on the alert\r\nand serve as a basis of distribution of labor for departmental ledger\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nA system of labor classification is as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) _Cattle Yards._--All labor in the care of cattle from arrival at\r\nplant, and delivering into knocking pens.\r\n\r\nIncludes expense items of caring for cattle, cleaning pens, troughs,\r\nfeeding and driving.\r\n\r\n(2) _Cattle Killing._--All labor on handling cattle from pens and\r\ndelivering dressed beef to coolers.\r\n\r\nIncludes all labor expense beginning with knocking cattle and all items\r\nof labor involved in the dressing of cattle and all the disposal of\r\nparts, as follows:\r\n\r\n_Hides_ dropped on floor ready for inspection.\r\n\r\n_Beef_ completely dressed, washed, weighed and delivered in the cooler\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n_Casings_, the gut sets delivered on floor ready for collection or\r\npassed to chute.\r\n\r\n_Tallow fats_ pulled from animal ready for disposal by rough tallow\r\ngang.\r\n\r\n_Heads and feet_ delivered on floor ready for picking up by rough\r\ntallow gang.\r\n\r\n_Blood_ passing to reservoir ready for pumping or flowing to fertilizer\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nThe killing of cattle cost shall include all labor for washing\r\npremises, grinding choppers, filing saws, or mechanic in charge of\r\nmachinery and equipment other than breakdowns or repairs.\r\n\r\n(3) _Rough Tallow Department._--Heads, taken from Killing Department,\r\ndelivery constituting separation from the animal.
