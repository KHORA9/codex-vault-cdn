During the war, when supplies available from\r\ncontinental Europe and Russia were reduced, Australia, New Zealand, and\r\nArgentina were encouraged to expand their dairy industry, and have\r\ntogether since that time continued as the most important sources of\r\nsupply of butter on the British markets.\r\n\r\nAs the flush of production in Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina\r\noccurs during the fall and winter months when production is lightest in\r\nNorth America and Europe, England now receives an average of two-thirds\r\nof the total supply of foreign butter during the winter and spring,\r\nwhereas formerly but one-half was received during this period.\r\n\r\nAlthough consumption does not necessarily follow the same seasonal trend\r\nas the imports, it is a fact, according to reports of London dealers,\r\nthat butter stocks are now lower than at the same time last year, when\r\nat least 50,000,000 lbs. of Government stocks still remained unsold in\r\nEngland. With comparatively light stocks and the certainty that imports\r\ninto England after July can not be as heavy as during the first six\r\nmonths, a speculative demand has been stimulated in that country in\r\nanticipation of an expected autumn shortage.\r\n\r\nAlthough butter production since the war has recovered rapidly in\r\npractically all of the important dairy countries, Russia is still out of\r\nthe world’s market. The cutting off of the Russian exports to England,\r\nwhich amounted to 150,000,000 lbs. annually from 1909 to 1913, was the\r\ngreatest single factor in bringing about, this change in the seasonal\r\nsupply of the latter country.\r\n\r\nThe present statistical position of the United States is, therefore,\r\nsomewhat misleading, unless due consideration is given to\r\n\r\n                   (Concluded on page 111, column 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             IN THIS ISSUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n ╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗\r\n ║                                                                Page.║\r\n ║=Crop Reports=                                                    106║\r\n ║  Condition of cotton crop on July 25.

S. Department of Agriculture on\r\nAug. 1. Compared with the condition of 71.2% on June 25, this shows a\r\ndecrease in condition of 0.4% for the month. The average condition of\r\nthe cotton crop on July 25 for the past 10 years stands at 73% of\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nA condition of 70.8% of normal on July 25 this year forecasts a yield\r\nper acre of about 157.2 lbs. and a total production of about 11,449,000\r\nbales of 500 lbs. gross weight each. The final outturn may be larger or\r\nsmaller than this amount, of course, depending upon whether or not the\r\nconditions that develop during the remainder of the season prove more or\r\nless favorable to the crop than such conditions ordinarily prove.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Condition of the Cotton Crop on July 25, with Comparisons.\r\n\r\n                             [100 = normal.]\r\n\r\n ───────────────┬───────────────────────┬───────┬───────┬───────────────\r\n     State.     │                       │ June  │ July  │\r\n                │                       │  25,  │  25,  │Change, June 25\r\n                │       July 25.        │ 1922. │ 1922. │  to July 25.\r\n ───────────────┼───────┬───────┬───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┬───────\r\n                │10‒yr. │       │       │       │       │10 yr. │\r\n                │  av.  │ 1920  │ 1921  │       │       │  av.  │ 1922\r\n ───────────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n Virginia       │     81│     74│     82│     85│     80│      0│     ‒5\r\n North Carolina │     77│     77│     75│     76│     78│     ‒1│     +2\r\n South Carolina │     73│     77│     62│     60│     60│     ‒2│      0\r\n Georgia        │     71│     68│     59│     58│     54│     ‒3│     ‒4\r\n                │       │       │       │       │       │       │\r\n Florida        │     71│     64│     60│     75│     65│     ‒5│    ‒10\r\n Alabama        │     69│     67│     58│     68│     70│     ‒5│     +2\r\n Mississippi    │     72│     71│     68│     76│     74│     ‒4│     ‒2\r\n Louisiana      │     70│     71│     59│     69│     70│     ‒7│     +1\r\n                │       │       │       │       │       │       │\r\n Texas          │     72│     74│     62│     72│     72│     ‒6│      0\r\n Arkansas       │     76│     78│     76│     80│     81│     ‒3│     +1\r\n Tennessee      │     78│     76│     75│     83│     85│      0│     +2\r\n Missouri       │     80│     81│     80│     92│     90│      0│     ‒2\r\n                │       │       │       │       │       │       │\r\n Oklahoma       │     77│     85│     68│     76│     75│     ‒2│     ‒1\r\n California     │     95│     85│     83│     91│     95│     +2│     +4\r\n Arizona        │  [1]90│     85│     89│     85│     86│  [1]+1│     +1\r\n New Mexico     │       │     85│     88│     85│     85│       │      0\r\n ───────────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n United States  │   73.0│   74.1│   64.7│   71.2│   70.8│   ‒3.9│   ‒0.4\r\n ───────────────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────\r\n\r\nLast year the production was 7,953,641 bales, two years ago 13,439,603\r\nbales, three years ago 11,420,763 bales, four years ago 12,040,532\r\nbales, and five years ago 11,302,375 bales.\r\n\r\nThe 1922 acreage of Egyptian type cotton is estimated at 80,000 acres in\r\nArizona and less than 1,000 acres in California. In 1921 Arizona had\r\n75,000 acres and California 9,000 acres, while in 1920 the estimate for\r\nArizona was 200,000 acres and for California 45,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThe department’s estimate of cotton acreage in cultivation on June 25,\r\nwhich was made public on July 3, remains unchanged at 34,852,000 acres\r\nbecause the acreage abandoned before that date was excluded. A great\r\ndecrease in cotton acreage followed the high acreage of 1920, which was\r\n37,043,000 acres, because of the disastrous break in prices to growers\r\nin that year.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying table gives detailed information on the condition of\r\nthe cotton crop on July 25, by States, together with comparisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n Paradox in Forecast Yield of Crop per Acre as Indicated by Condition.\r\n\r\nA crop may deteriorate in condition during a growing month and yet its\r\nyield per acre as forecast by a computation based on the lowered\r\ncondition may increase. In the average of crop experiences during the\r\ngrowing period a certain crop declines in condition during a certain\r\nmonth by a certain percentage of a normal condition.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the cotton crop has a record of a deterioration of 3.9% of\r\na normal condition from June 25 to July 25 in the average of the last 10\r\nyears. As a matter of fact, however, during this period in 1922 the\r\ndeterioration in the condition of the cotton crop was only 0.4%. This is\r\nclearly a relative improvement because it is less than the usual\r\ndeterioration of 3.9%. Hence the yield per acre in the forecast for July\r\n25 must be greater than in the forecast made a month earlier,\r\nnotwithstanding the absolute decline in condition.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Apple-tree tent caterpillars= are very numerous in New England and New\r\nYork this year. Farther south these pests are noticeably less numerous\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Report on Cabbage, Celery, and Onions in Michigan.\r\n\r\nReports from the field service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\nfor the date of July 25 concerning commercial cabbage, celery, and\r\nonions in Michigan contain the following information:\r\n\r\n_Cabbage._—Five counties in southern Michigan have about 1,285 acres of\r\ncommercial cabbage compared with last year’s area of 590 acres, or an\r\nincrease of 118%. The counties and their cabbage areas are: Ingham 160\r\nacres, Eaton 225 acres, Jackson 67 acres, Hillsdale 233 acres, and\r\nBranch 600 acres. The principal increases over 1921 are in Hillsdale and\r\nBranch Counties. The crop is generally in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nIn Hillsdale County, Jonesville has 200 acres, of which 130 acres are\r\nunder contract; Mosherville has 13 acres for kraut; and Litchfield has\r\n20 acres. In Branch County, Quincy has approximately 250 acres of\r\ncommercial cabbage, of which 170 acres are under contract: and Coldwater\r\nhas about 350 acres, with 60% under contract. The kraut plant in\r\nColdwater will be in operation this year. Baroda, in Berrien County, has\r\n60 acres of cabbage and Niles, in the same county, 40 acres for kraut.\r\n\r\nIn northern Michigan, Saginaw County has 1,400 acres of commercial\r\ncabbage, 300 acres of which are under contract.\r\n\r\n_Celery._—The combined area of commercial celery in Lenawee, Cass,\r\nAllegan, and Kent counties is 1,005 acres, an increase of 450 acres over\r\n1921. Lenawee County has 117 acres, Cass 118 acres, Allegan 170 acres,\r\nand Kent 600 acres. The crop is in excellent condition.\r\n\r\n_Onions._—Allegan County has about 603 acres of commercial onions, or\r\n88% more than in 1921. The Gull Swamp section (Martin, Gull Plain,\r\nShelbyville, Hooper) has approximately 550 acres. Other acreages are:\r\nWayland 8 acres, Dorr 25 acres, Herps 20 acres. The condition of the\r\ncrop in Allegan County is above average. Kent County has an onion\r\nacreage about the same as last year’s.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Florida watermelons= were widely distributed this season.

In 1921 the harvest of early\r\nand intermediate onions totaled 10,287 cars.\r\n\r\nAbout 38,000 acres have been planted to late commercial onions, compared\r\nwith about 35,000 acres in 1921, according to the department’s\r\nestimates. The condition of the late commercial onion crop was 83% of\r\nnormal on July 15. This condition is about average.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying tables give detailed information, by States, on the\r\nearly and intermediate crops and the late crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n Acreage and Forecast of Production of Commercial Onions in Intermediate and\r\n                                Early States.\r\n\r\n ──────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬─────────────────────\r\n     State.    │     Acreage.      │  Yield per acre.  │     Production.\r\n ──────────────┼──────────┬────────┼────────┬──────────┼──────────┬──────────\r\n               │Harvested,│Planted,│Average,│Indicated,│Harvested,│Forecast,\r\n               │   1921   │  1922  │  1921  │   1922   │   1921   │   1922\r\n ──────────────┼──────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n               │ _Acres._ │_Acres._│ _Bu._  │  _Bu._   │_Cars._[2]│_Cars._[2]\r\n Iowa          │     1,200│   1,600│     202│       332│       485│     1,082\r\n Ky.           │     1,000│   1,000│     324│       300│       648│       600\r\n Md.           │       500│     500│     250│       260│       250│       260\r\n N.J.          │     2,400│   2,400│     239│       336│     1,147│     1,613\r\n Tex.          │     1,000│   1,500│     275│       304│       550│     1,092\r\n Va.           │       800│   1,000│     280│       280│       448│       560\r\n Wash.         │     1,300│   1,500│     363│       522│       944│     1,566\r\n ──────────────┼──────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n Total         │          │        │        │          │          │\r\n   intermediate│          │        │        │          │          │\r\n   States      │     8,200│   9,500│     273│       355│     4,472│     6,733\r\n Early States  │          │        │        │          │          │\r\n   previously  │          │        │        │          │          │\r\n   reported[3] │    13,500│  16,000│     228│       227│     5,815│     6,852\r\n ──────────────┼──────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n Total,        │          │        │        │          │          │\r\n   intermediate│          │        │        │          │          │\r\n   and early   │          │        │        │          │          │\r\n   States      │    21,700│  25,500│     245│       275│    10,287│    13,605\r\n ──────────────┴──────────┴────────┴────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────\r\n\r\n\r\n       Acreage and Condition of Commercial Onions in Late States.\r\n\r\n ───────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────\r\n   State.   │     Acreage.      │        Condition (100=normal).\r\n ───────────┼──────────┬────────┼───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────\r\n            │          │        │July 1,│       │       │       │ July\r\n            │Harvested,│Planted,│ 7‒yr. │July 1,│June 1,│July 1,│  15,\r\n            │  1921.   │ 1922.  │  av.  │ 1921. │ 1922. │ 1922. │ 1922.\r\n ───────────┼──────────┼────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n            │  _Acres._│_Acres._│_P.ct._│_P.ct._│_P.ct._│_P.ct._│_P.ct._\r\n Calif.,    │          │        │       │       │       │       │\r\n   central  │          │        │       │       │       │       │\r\n   dist.    │     7,800│   6,500│     90│     89│    100│     90│     95\r\n Colo.      │       800│   1,500│     80│     91│     90│     88│     91\r\n Idaho.     │       100│     300│     89│     94│     88│     94│     98\r\n Ill.       │     1,100│   1,300│     89│     79│     75│     82│     79\r\n Ind.       │     3,698│   1,600│     78│     73│     77│     73│     83\r\n Mass.      │     4,500│   4,600│     83│     73│     78│     79│     75\r\n Mich.      │     1,300│   1,700│     79│     65│     86│     89│     88\r\n Minn.      │     1,300│   1,300│     88│     89│     85│     95│     90\r\n N.

In beef steer trade the general decline was assisted materially\r\nby the heaviest run of native, western, and Canadian grassers of the\r\nseason. Downturns of mostly 25¢ at Chicago and of 50¢-$l at some\r\nMissouri River markets were apparent on the more common descriptions. As\r\nsupplies of western grassers increased, the supply of long-fed bullocks\r\ndecreased and as the latter were sought by all interests, the widest\r\nprice range of the season on beef steers was created at all markets.\r\n\r\nHog prices fluctuated sharply, closing Chicago values being 25¢‒50¢\r\nlower on mixed grades and heavy packers, and 40¢‒55¢ on good butcher\r\nhogs compared with the close of the previous week. Much of the supply at\r\nOmaha and a good percentage of the run at Chicago and some other markets\r\nconsisted of heavy sows and mixed packing grades, and these pulled the\r\ngeneral average down to the lowest levels since early in February.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SHEEP TRADE ERRATIC.\r\n\r\nTrade in fat sheep and feeding lambs was erratic, with closing prices\r\nhighest of the week but showing an irregular basis compared with the\r\nprevious week’s close.\r\n\r\nReceipts at 10 large markets for the week were approximately 199,000\r\ncattle, 502,000 hogs and 195,000 sheep, compared with 215,357 cattle,\r\n452,902 hogs, and 244,517 sheep the previous week, and 166,112 cattle,\r\n398,424 hogs, and 199,137 sheep the corresponding week last year.\r\n\r\n_Cattle._—Receipts of grassers from native territory, range States, and\r\nCanada, assumed the largest proportions of the season. Short-feds also\r\nwere numerous, and long-fed matured beef steers and yearlings\r\ncorrespondingly scarce. Canadians were unusually numerous at St. Paul\r\nand Chicago for so early in the season, the July supply at the former\r\nmarket up to July 27 standing at 5,800 as compared with 988 for the\r\ncorresponding period a year ago. The collapse of cattle values in\r\nCanadian provinces was an incentive for shipping across the border.\r\n\r\nCanadians and Dakotas were generally in poor flesh and turned at\r\n$4.75‒$6.50, killers taking a few at the latter price. Oklahoma and\r\nTexas grass steers invaded Kansas City and St. Louis in liberal numbers,\r\nand sold largely within a spread of $4.25‒$7, many quarantine steers,\r\ngrading as cutters, selling around $4.25‒$4.75. Kansas pasture cattle\r\nwere well represented at Kansas City, and winter grass steers of good\r\nweight and condition sold there upward to $8.75 or slightly higher. A\r\nfew lots of Utah and California steers arrived at Omaha. Bulk of grass\r\nsteers sold there at $6‒$7.25, a large proportion of the far western\r\nsteers being in feeder flesh. One lot of Montana steers showing breeding\r\nquality and good killing flesh brought $8.75 at that market from a\r\nproducer. This lot met good packer competition, and the relatively high\r\nsale price indicated the plainness of the early run of grassers in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nLong-fed matured bullocks, averaging 1,443 lbs. reached $10.80 at\r\nChicago and best long yearlings topped at $10.50, the premium of heavy\r\nsteers over yearlings continuing in evidence. Sales above $10.25 were\r\ncomparatively scarce, bulk of beef steers at Chicago being of quality\r\nand flesh to sell at $8.50‒$10. At that point few bullocks that had\r\nreceived even a sparse corn ration on grass sold under $8, but common\r\nnative and western grassers cashed well below that figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PRODUCERS IN MARKET.\r\n\r\nThe influx of westerns augmented the stocker and feeder supply and\r\nproducers took more notice of their pasture and feed lot needs than\r\nrecently, insisting, however, on lower prices except on kinds of high\r\nquality. A spread of $5.50‒$6.50 absorbed the majority of stockers and\r\nlight feeders at Chicago, a few heavy feeders reaching $7.50, while good\r\nfeeders commanded $7.25‒$7.75 at Kansas City, most of the desirable\r\nstockers bringing $6.50‒$7 at that market. Common light stock steers\r\ndescended to $4.50 and lower in instances there and at St. Louis.\r\n\r\nShe stock offerings were comparatively scarce, and flesh condition for\r\nthe most part was plain to medium. Highly finished kosher cows\r\nmaintained $8‒$8.50 levels and above at Chicago, corn-fed yearling\r\nheifers selling in line with steers of a similar finish. In-between\r\ngrades of beef cows and heifers lacked dependable outlet, generous runs\r\nof low grade grass steers at river markets being a weakening influence.\r\nBulk of fat cows and heifers at Chicago brought $5‒$7.25. Canners\r\ndisplayed strength, few healthy descriptions selling there below $3.\r\n\r\nBulls closed largely 25¢ lower; desirable heavy bolognas cashed upward\r\nto $4.75‒$4.85 early at Chicago, but descended to around $4.50, heavy\r\nbeef bulls sharing the decline. Reduced arrivals of veal calves at\r\nChicago somewhat counteracted the effect of slump conditions in the\r\ndressed market and values advanced 25¢‒50¢, packers taking desirable\r\nvealers at the close at Chicago at $9.50‒$10, these interests as well as\r\nsmall killers paying upward to $10.50 for specialties.\r\n\r\n_Hogs._—Although receipts at Chicago were moderate, being about the same\r\nas in the preceding week, those at western points\r\n\r\n                   (Concluded on page 109, column 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n          MODERATE RECEIPTS OF MOST MEATS IN EXCESS OF DEMAND\r\nPrices Generally Lower on Beef, Veal, Lamb, and Mutton—Heavy Pork Loins\r\n                              Also Lower.\r\n\r\n             (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.)\r\n\r\nModerate receipts of beef, veal, lamb, and mutton were in excess of the\r\nlimited demand and prices were generally lower for the week ending July\r\n28. Heavy pork loins were weak to lower with other classes steady to\r\nhigher, except at New York, where all averages shared in the decline.\r\n\r\n_Beef._—Moderate receipts of beef at eastern markets found a limited\r\noutlet. Good and choice grades of steers were not plentiful, but were\r\nneglected in favor of poorer grades as prices were given more\r\nconsideration than quality. The demand for chucks and rattles showed\r\nsome improvement, and prices on these were relatively firmer than on\r\nother cuts. Cows were mostly of medium and common grades and were hard\r\nto move. At Chicago the assortment of steer beef was good, but prices\r\nweakened under a narrow demand. Few desirable cows were available, most\r\nof the supply having consisted of the poorer grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PRICES UNEVEN AT CLOSE.\r\n\r\nCompared with the close of the preceding week. Boston was about steady,\r\nNew York unevenly 50¢-$3 lower, Philadelphia $1‒$2 lower, and Chicago $1\r\nlower. Cows were weak to $1 lower at Boston, $l-$2 lower at New York and\r\nPhiladelphia, and 50¢ lower at Chicago. Receipts of bulls were light,\r\nand prices closed steady to $1 higher at Boston, steady to $1 lower at\r\nNew York, and 25¢‒50¢ lower at Chicago, with very few on sale at\r\nPhiladelphia. Kosher beef trade was slow, and prices closed around $1\r\nlower at New York and unchanged elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Veal._—Except at Boston the demand for veal at eastern markets was poor\r\nafter the early part of the week, and prices declined daily. At that\r\nmarket western dressed receipts and local slaughter were light and\r\ndemand fair. At Chicago the fairly liberal offerings were too great for\r\nthe slow demand, and the market had a weak undertone. Compared with the\r\nclose of the preceding week, Boston was steady to $1 lower. New York\r\n$2‒$3 lower, Philadelphia $2‒$4 lower, and Chicago $1 lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DAILY AVERAGE WEIGHT AND COST OF HOGS, WEEK ENDING JULY 29, 1922.\r\n\r\n                        [Price per 100 pounds.]\r\n\r\n ────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────\r\n   Market.   │   Mon.   │  Tues.   │   Wed.   │  Thurs.  │   Fri.\r\n ────────────┼────┬─────┼────┬─────┼────┬─────┼────┬─────┼────┬─────\r\n             │Wt. │Cost.│Wt. │Cost.│Wt. │Cost.│Wt. │Cost.│Wt. │Cost.\r\n ────────────┼────┼─────┼────┼─────┼────┼─────┼────┼─────┼────┼─────\r\n Chicago     │ 259│$9.73│ 269│$9.52│ 252│$9.45│ 267│$9.25│ 266│$9.24\r\n E.

Compared with the close of the preceding week,\r\nBoston and New York were $1‒$3 lower, Philadelphia $2‒$3 lower, and\r\nChicago $1‒$2 lower.\r\n\r\n_Mutton._—The bulk of the moderate receipts of mutton at eastern markets\r\nwas undesirable because of weight and excessive finish. Prices were also\r\ninfluenced by the drop in lamb values, and daily declines were the rule.\r\nAt Chicago offerings consisted largely of heavy ewes and bucks, but\r\nprices showed little change. Compared with the close of the preceding\r\nweek, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia were $2‒$4 lower, with Chicago\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\n_Pork._—Fresh light loins were seasonally scarce and relatively firmer\r\nin price than heavier averages. Receipts of fresh loins were light, but\r\nthere was an ample supply of the frozen product on sale. Compared with\r\nthe close of the preceding week, Boston and Philadelphia were steady to\r\n$1 higher except on heavy loins, which were weak to $1 lower with some\r\nsales off more. New York closed unevenly $2‒$5 lower, and Chicago steady\r\nto $1 higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Wool Imports at Two Ports.\r\n\r\nImports of wool through the port of Philadelphia during the week ending\r\nJuly 29 amounted to 417,226 lbs., valued at $77,165.

107.)\r\n\r\nwere considerably heavier. Chicago quality was the best for several\r\nweeks, a generous proportion of the supply consisting of good light and\r\nmedium weight butchers. This, coupled with the narrowest shipping outlet\r\nfor hogs in weeks, attributed to an extent to unsettled railway labor\r\nconditions, was partially responsible for sharp declines, especially on\r\nthe better grades. Closing prices Were 40¢‒55¢ under those of the week\r\nprevious on bulk of good lights and butchers and 25¢‒50¢ lower on mixed\r\nand packing grades. A slight reaction was noticed toward the week end,\r\nwith small advances scored on some of the in-between butchers and better\r\npacking grades.\r\n\r\nBig packers were bearish and very indifferent buyers, even at the sharp\r\ndecline, leaving liberal holdovers each day. The week’s top at Chicago\r\nwas $11, secured on early sessions for good lights and light butchers,\r\nbut best sold at the close at $10.60, and bulk of good lights and light\r\nbutchers sold at the week end from $10.30‒$10.50. Bulk of good 220\r\nlb.‒300 lb. butchers closed at $9.75‒$10.25. Such shipping orders as\r\nwere filled called largely for the better grades of mixed packing, good,\r\nsmooth, light weight sows and these failed to show the extreme decline\r\napparent on other grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GOOD PIGS IN DEMAND.\r\n\r\nDemand for good pigs at Chicago was broad and such sold readily all\r\nweek, with bulk of good 100‒130 lb. averages clearing from $9.50‒$10.50.\r\nSaturday’s closing values on pigs were around 25¢ lower for the week.\r\nStock pig prices, both at St. Paul and Missouri River markets declined\r\n25¢‒35¢, best strong weights selling at $10.25‒$10.50 at St. Paul and\r\nKansas City, respectively. Several shipments of good quality thin sows\r\nwent to the country from St. Paul and Chicago for feeding purposes,\r\ncosting $8‒$9. The trade generally displayed considerable anxiety on\r\naccount of the railway and coal strikes.\r\n\r\n_Sheep._—An oversupply of sheep at Jersey City at the week’s opening was\r\nthe chief factor in further declines in prices following the declines\r\nlate last week at Chicago and other western markets, but with aggregate\r\nslaughter falling considerably short of the week previous, the market\r\nmade good recovery as the week’s trading progressed. Closing Chicago\r\nprices, compared with the week previous, were strong to 25¢ higher on\r\nfat native lambs, mostly 50¢ higher on cull natives, steady to 15¢ lower\r\non fat western lambs, 35¢‒50¢ lower on western feeding lambs, generally\r\nsteady on light sheep and 25¢‒50¢ lower on heavy sheep.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to Monday when Jersey City had a full supply, the run of\r\nsoutheastern lambs was light and natives from other sections were in\r\nsmaller supply than during the preceding week. The market-ward movement\r\nof range stock from the Northwest was of fair volume, although hampered\r\nto a certain extent by conditions arising from the strike of railway\r\nshopmen. Feeder demand was narrow at the week’s opening but declines\r\nthen enforced attracted buyers subsequently and both fat and feeder\r\nlambs closed about 25¢ above the week’s low spot.\r\n\r\nAt the week end, choice western lambs were safely quotable up to $13 at\r\nChicago, good Oregons, rather lightly sorted, selling up to $12.85, and\r\nbest natives up to $12.75 straight, with bulk of natives at $12.50$12.60\r\nand native culls mostly at $8‒$8.50. Feeder buyers paid up to $12.50 for\r\nlight and tidy weight Western feeder lambs, but a number of loads of\r\nheavy feeders sold during the week at $11.50‒$11.75. Fat heavy ewes sold\r\ndownward to $3, a few below $3.50 at the close, while fat light native\r\nand Western ewes reached $7‒$7.25. Wethers and yearlings were virtually\r\nlacking. There was call for western yearling breeding ewes, with none\r\noffered and choice quotable to $11.50. Native yearling ewes were taken\r\non breeder account up to $9.50‒$9.75, twos to fours mixed up to\r\n$8‒$8.75, with heavies and less desirable kinds on down to $6 and below,\r\ndepending on age, weight, and quality.\r\n\r\n_Opening, July 31._—Beef steers, yearlings, butcher cows, and heifers at\r\nChicago sold actively at strong to 25¢ higher prices, mostly 10¢‒15¢\r\nhigher. Eleven loads of matured beef steers averaging 1,283 lbs.‒1,694\r\nlbs. topped at $10.60. Best long yearlings brought $10.50, bulk of beef\r\nsteers $8.50‒$10.15. Twelve loads of Canadian steers arrived, five loads\r\ngoing to stocker and feeder dealers at $5.75. Stockers and feeders\r\ndisplayed some strength.\r\n\r\nGood butcher weight hogs gained 10¢‒15¢ and closed firm at the advance.\r\nTop was $10.70 with bulk of desirable butchers at $9.90‒$10.60. Activity\r\nof shippers, who absorbed around 10,000 head, lent zest and higher\r\nprices to the better grades. Mixed and packing grades opened higher, but\r\nlacking good competition closed steady to 150 lower, bulk of packing\r\nsows turning at $7.75‒$8.60.\r\n\r\nFat lambs closed weak to 15¢ lower after a steady to strong start.\r\nNatives and westerns topped at $12.75, bulk of the natives bringing\r\n$12.25‒$12.60 and bulk of the rangers $12.65. Feeding lambs at $12.35\r\ndownward were lower. Sheep held firm. Choice handy Montana ewes reached\r\n$7.50.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     STOCKER AND FEEDER SHIPMENTS.\r\n\r\n                  Week Ending Friday, July 28, 1922.\r\n\r\n     ─────────────────────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────\r\n                              │Cattle and │           │\r\n                              │  calves.  │   Hogs.   │  Sheep.\r\n     ─────────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────\r\n     Market origin:           │           │           │\r\n       Chicago                │      4,077│           │     17,432\r\n       Denver                 │      4,368│        286│        241\r\n       East St. Louis         │      3,317│        836│        492\r\n       Fort Worth             │      1,406│        170│      1,369\r\n       Indianapolis           │        908│        192│        772\r\n       Kansas City            │     18,483│        917│      1,919\r\n       Oklahoma City          │      2,996│        120│\r\n       Omaha                  │      8,591│         75│     19,861\r\n       St. Joseph             │      2,098│        298│      2,798\r\n       St. Paul               │     13,441│      1,169│        883\r\n       Sioux City             │      5,786│        353│        333\r\n       Wichita                │      1,512│        136│\r\n     ─────────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────\r\n               Total          │     66,983│      4,552│     46,100\r\n       Previous week          │     47,627│      5,140│     34,919\r\n       Same week last year[5] │     28,747│      2,161│     41,592\r\n     ═════════════════════════╪═══════════╪═══════════╪═══════════\r\n     State destination:       │           │           │\r\n       California             │           │        170│\r\n       Colorado               │      1,374│        286│\r\n       Illinois               │      8,458│        826│      3,681\r\n       Indiana                │      2,105│        192│      3,521\r\n       Iowa                   │     17,302│      1,266│      8,695\r\n       Kansas                 │      6,716│        266│      1,380\r\n       Kentucky               │        487│        366│      1,202\r\n       Maryland               │        101│           │        310\r\n       Michigan               │        308│           │     11,445\r\n       Minnesota              │      1,014│        397│        513\r\n       Missouri               │      5,654│        588│      4,159\r\n       Montana                │        493│           │\r\n       Nebraska               │     14,942│         75│      9,417\r\n       New York               │         48│           │\r\n       Ohio                   │      1,009│           │        801\r\n       Oklahoma               │        735│        120│\r\n       Pennsylvania           │      3,894│           │\r\n       South Dakota           │        837│           │\r\n       Tennessee              │         36│           │\r\n       Texas                  │        901│           │        270\r\n       Virginia               │        129│           │        411\r\n       West Virginia          │         59│           │        121\r\n       Wisconsin              │        323│           │        174\r\n       Wyoming                │         58│           │\r\n     ─────────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────\r\n               Total          │     66,983│      4,552│     46,100\r\n     ─────────────────────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────\r\n\r\n\r\n                        New Publications Issued.\r\n\r\nThe following publications were issued by the U.

The resulting lower prices attracted a\r\nspeculative demand which was largely instrumental in causing equally\r\nradical advances during the latter part of the week. The prices at the\r\nclose of the week, however, hovered near the same levels as at the\r\nopening, and conditions, although not so extremely weak because of\r\nlighter stocks, were equally unsettled.\r\n\r\nSince early in July receivers have been burdened with heavy\r\naccumulations of receipts because of the curtailed storing demand, and\r\nthe strength of the market has been maintained by the hope that\r\nconsuming outlets would become larger, that receipts would decrease more\r\nrapidly, or that exporters would take considerable quantities. When\r\nthere appeared to be no immediate outlet for the accumulating stocks,\r\ndealers slashed prices and cleared away a large part of the\r\naccumulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SPECULATIVE INTEREST DEVELOPS.\r\n\r\nThe lower prices, however, brought forth a speculative interest which\r\nwas so keen that prices reacted practically to the level on Monday. But\r\nwith the higher prices buyers again disappeared, the market became very\r\nunsettled, and some price reductions ensued.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening factors are an excellent consumptive demand,\r\npossibilities of export and the improbability of any considerable\r\nimports. A shortage in stocks of butter in foreign markets makes it\r\nprobable that considerable butter will be exported and improbable that\r\nthe imports will be large. Aside from the possibility of exports and\r\nimports, the enormous quantity of butter going into consumption is a\r\nmajor factor in the possible trend of the markets.\r\n\r\nReceipts at the four markets since Jan. 1 show a surplus of some\r\n58,000,000 lbs. over the same period a year ago. Of these receipts,\r\nnearly 11,000,000 lbs. in excess of last year was stored. Import and\r\nexport figures for the first six months of the year show an excess of\r\nexports over imports of 2,365,000 lbs. During the corresponding period\r\nin 1921 there was an excess of imports amounting to 6,139,000 lbs.\r\nDeducting the 11,000,000 lbs. which was stored in excess of last year\r\nand the decrease of 8,000,000 lbs. due to foreign trade, the apparent\r\nincrease in consumption since Jan. 1, 1922, amounts to some 39,000,000\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while larger quantities have gone into consumption\r\nthere are some operators who are bearish and claim that prices will have\r\nto rule higher next winter than last winter in order to allow a fair\r\nprofit on present storage stocks, and that this condition naturally\r\nwould reduce consumption. It is claimed also that production may\r\ncontinue comparatively heavy, making large outlets necessary. Some also\r\npoint out that during our winter months the countries in the Southern\r\nHemisphere have their season of flush production and that imports from\r\nthose countries are a possibility.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the markets at present are weak and\r\nunsettled, and receivers generally desire to keep current receipts\r\nmoving, most of those owning storage butter have confidence in holding\r\nit at its present cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WHOLESALE PRICES OF BUTTER AND CHEESE, WEEK ENDING JULY 29, 1922.\r\n\r\n                           [Cents per

During the week ending July 29 this weakness became more\r\npronounced, and prices at the Wisconsin primary markets were lowered as\r\nmuch as a full cent in an effort to stimulate trading.\r\n\r\nBuyers, however, were not eager to take on any more goods than could be\r\nreadily used to meet daily requirements. Although a few cars of fine\r\ncheese were purchased early in the week for storage, the majority of\r\nbuyers felt that the market was on too high a plane for speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SPECULATIVE DEMAND ABSENT.\r\n\r\nThe absence of speculative support has probably been the largest factor\r\nin the weaker country markets, and the reflection of this weakness in\r\nthe distributing markets. Moreover, movement into consumptive channels\r\nhas not been active for some time. As storage demand has been lacking\r\nand the primary markets have been showing signs of weakening, most\r\nbuyers at distributing points adopted the policy of hand-to-mouth buying\r\nin anticipation of lower prices. Advices at the end of the week\r\nindicated that some dealers do not look for a revival of trade until\r\nprices at country points reach 16¢, about 2¢ below present prices.\r\nHowever, this sentiment is not universal, and many dealers think that\r\npresent prices may not be far from bottom.\r\n\r\nEmbargoes on railroad shipments of perishable foodstuffs in the southern\r\nand southwestern sections of the country have reduced shipments below\r\nnormal requirements, and until the rail strike is ended but little\r\nsupport is expected from those sections. In fact, many in the trade\r\nbelieve that while the strike may cause higher prices in certain\r\nconsuming centers where supplies are exhausted, embargoes on shipments\r\nwill tend to weaken the primary markets because of curtailed outlets.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the week the tone of the market was barely steady.\r\nHolders were free sellers, and in many instances were inclined to make\r\nconcessions in order to keep stocks as low as possible. Little export or\r\nimport business was reported, although small shipments of Split Twins\r\nwere imported from Canada. However, both the export and import business\r\nwas of small consequence and did not affect the market. With production\r\nin excess of consumption and speculators off the market, many in the\r\ntrade expect an unsettled market accompanied by lower prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   IMPORTS OF EGGS DURING JUNE, 1922.\r\n\r\n                [Data from the Department of Commerce.]\r\n\r\n          ───────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────\r\n          Imported from—     │          │Dried and │\r\n                             │ Eggs in  │  frozen  │   Egg\r\n                             │the shell │  eggs.   │ albumen.\r\n          ───────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n                             │ _Dozen._ │_Pounds._ │_Pounds._\r\n          Denmark            │     2,100│          │\r\n          Canada             │    16,957│    12,800│\r\n          China              │        72│   865,000│   374,140\r\n          Hongkong           │    24,319│     7,636│       300\r\n          Other countries    │         6│          │\r\n          ───────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n                Total:       │          │          │\r\n              June, 1922     │    43,454│   885,436│   374,440\r\n              June, 1921     │    44,941│   726,596│   293,948\r\n          Jan. to June, 1922 │   632,189│ 4,840,377│ 4,072,171\r\n          Jan. to June, 1921 │ 2,471,167│ 6,198,562│ 1,322,519\r\n          ───────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────\r\n\r\n\r\n            CONDENSED AND EVAPORATED MILK MARKETS STILL SLOW\r\n     Domestic Products Meeting With More Competition From European\r\n                        Goods—Exports Decrease.\r\n\r\nThe same relative inactivity which has featured condensed and evaporated\r\nmilk markets for several months continued during July, and prospects for\r\nany materially improved demand are so slight that many of the trade who\r\nhave held a more or less confident attitude are beginning to lose some\r\nof their optimism.\r\n\r\nExport demand, upon which canned milk manufacturers have come to depend\r\nto a large extent as an outlet for surplus domestic production, has\r\nbecome less of a factor each month. Buying for relief purposes, which\r\nconstituted such a support to the evaporated milk market especially, has\r\npractically ceased, and no additional orders seem to be in sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LITTLE FOREIGN DEMAND EXPECTED.\r\n\r\nDomestic demand in England is reported as somewhat heavier, but American\r\nmanufacturers have as competitors an increasing number of European\r\nfactories which are able to lay down the goods at a lower cost. In fact,\r\nforeign demand is not expected to absorb very large quantities of\r\nAmerican-made goods in the very near future. Latest export figures are\r\nfor the month of June and indicate a slight decrease under May and a\r\nvery large decrease under June, 1921.\r\n\r\nCondenseries, however, have had at least one favorable condition during\r\nthe past few months which has helped considerably to offset the dull\r\ndemand for canned milk. Prices of both butter and cheese have been at\r\nlevels that made it possible to divert surplus milk into one or the\r\nother of these products, and as a result the production of condensed and\r\nevaporated goods has been held as low as was consistent with good\r\nbusiness practice. These outlets have been fortunate not only because of\r\nthe lighter demand which has featured both condensed and evaporated milk\r\nmarkets, but because of the upward tendency of costs of manufacturing as\r\nwell. Seasonal advances in prices of raw milk are almost at hand, and in\r\nthe case of condensed milk, sugar is over one-third higher in cost than\r\nit was in the spring. The latter has been of considerable influence in\r\ndiverting trade demand to evaporated milk on account of the lower prices\r\nat which this class of goods could be sold.\r\n\r\nThe summer demand from the domestic trade for condensed and evaporated\r\nmilk has not been up to expectations. The icecream trade especially has\r\ntaken much smaller quantities of goods than condensing firms had\r\nanticipated. This is explained partly by the fact that powdered milk is\r\nbeing more widely used in the manufacture of ice cream, and partly by\r\nthe relatively cool weather in various consuming sections of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSummarized figures from manufacturers indicate that condensing\r\noperations have been carried on conservatively and that due\r\nconsideration has been given to the anticipated and actual dull summer\r\ndemand from all classes of trade. Although total stocks on July 1, as\r\nindicated in the accompanying tables, reveal a moderately heavy increase\r\nover June 1, it must be borne in mind that the heavy producing season\r\nhas just passed. It is to be noted also that while total stocks on July\r\n1 were heavier than on the first of the previous month unsold stocks\r\nwere lighter. Furthermore, a comparison of total stocks on July 1 this\r\nyear and last shows a decrease of approximately 26%. Therefore, from the\r\nstatistical standpoint, markets were, perhaps, in better shape on July 1\r\nthan they were June 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Stocks and Exports of Condensed and Evaporated Milk.\r\n\r\n              [In thousands of pounds; i. e., 000 omitted].\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────\r\n         Stocks.        │               │    June 1,    │\r\n                        │ July 1, 1922. │   1922.[11]   │ July 1, 1921.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────┬───────┼───────┬───────┼───────┬───────\r\n                        │ Case  │ Bulk  │ Case  │ Bulk  │ Case  │ Bulk\r\n                        │goods. │goods. │goods. │goods. │goods. │goods.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n       CONDENSED.       │       │       │       │       │       │\r\n Total stocks           │ 21,706│ 22,078│ 25,032│ 12,520│ 33,670│ 27,981\r\n Total unsold stocks    │ 16,325│ 16,215│ 21,775│  9,360│ 28,577│ 21,567\r\n Total unfilled orders  │    183│    229│       │    422│    460│\r\n                        │       │       │       │       │       │\r\n       EVAPORATED.      │       │       │       │       │       │\r\n Total stocks           │141,380│    499│135,895│    370│169,576│  1,331\r\n Total unsold stocks    │ 84,234│    351│109,238│    362│142,215│  1,318\r\n Total unfilled orders  │  1,196│       │  1,315│       │  2,342│\r\n ═══════════════════════╪═══════╧═══════╪═══════╧═══════╪═══════╧═══════\r\n        Exports.        │  June, 1922.  │  May, 1922.   │  June, 1921.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────\r\n Condensed milk         │          4,817│          6,678│          8,060\r\n Evaporated milk        │         10,890│          9,032│         13,640\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────\r\n          Total         │         15,707│         15,710│         21,700\r\n ───────────────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n           Prices to Producers at Condenseries for 3.5% Milk.\r\n\r\n                            [Per 100 pounds.]\r\n\r\n ───────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────\r\n Geographic section.│By manufacturers of case │By manufacturers of bulk\r\n                    │     and bulk goods.     │       goods only.\r\n ───────────────────┼────────────┬────────────┼────────────┬────────────\r\n                    │   July.    │   June.    │   July.    │   June.\r\n ───────────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────\r\n New England        │       $1.73│       $1.53│            │\r\n Middle Atlantic    │        1.83│        1.85│       $1.76│       $1.62\r\n South Atlantic     │        1.69│        1.64│        1.45│        1.45\r\n East North Central │        1.58│        1.42│        1.71│        1.62\r\n West North Central │        1.59│        1.53│        1.56│        1.56\r\n Western (North)    │        1.65│        1.56│        1.71│        1.54\r\n Western (South)    │        4.61│        1.42│            │\r\n ───────────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────\r\n    United States   │        1.60│        1.45│        1.72│        1.61\r\n ───────────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n           Wholesale Prices of Condensed and Evaporated Milk.\r\n\r\n                          [To domestic trade.]\r\n\r\n ───────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────\r\n Geographic section.│Sweetened condensed.

Danish exporters in recent years have scattered their\r\nexports to various other countries, and while not so dependent upon\r\nEngland for a market as previously, could at any time take advantage of\r\nany favorable offer from their long-established British trade. The flush\r\nof the butter production in Denmark was reached this year by June 1 and\r\nthe competition met in the English market is now not so largely European\r\nas formerly, which doubtless leaves Denmark with some seasonal\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe prospective demand for butter in England during the rest of this\r\nyear depends largely, of course, upon the consumer’s purchasing power.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MILK POWDER REPORT FOR JULY.\r\n\r\n                 Manufacturers’ Stocks of Powdered Milk.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────\r\n                    │       Whole milk powder.│     Skimmed milk powder.\r\n ───────────────────┼────────────┬────────────┼────────────┬────────────\r\n                    │Case goods. │Bulk goods. │Case goods. │Bulk goods.\r\n ───────────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────\r\n Total stocks,[12]  │            │            │            │\r\n   July 1:          │   _Pounds._│   _Pounds._│   _Pounds._│   _Pounds._\r\n        1921        │     393,090│     854,980│     245,481│  11,039,889\r\n        1922        │     110,434│   1,269,262│     194,479│   7,484,849\r\n                    │            │            │            │\r\n Unsold stocks,[13] │            │            │            │\r\n   July 1:          │            │            │            │\r\n        1921        │     393,090│     128,980│     245,481│   8,016,419\r\n        1922        │     110,434│     538,588│     133,101│   3,341,739\r\n ───────────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n       Wholesale Prices of Skimmed Milk Powder During June, 1922.\r\n\r\n                           [Cents per pound.]\r\n\r\n ───────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────\r\n                    │     Case goods.[14]     │     Barreled goods.\r\n ───────────────────┼────────────┬────────────┼────────────┬────────────\r\n Geographic section.│            │  Bulk of   │            │  Bulk of\r\n                    │            │sales, fresh│            │sales, fresh\r\n                    │ Range.[15] │ goods.[16] │ Range.[15] │ goods.[16]\r\n ───────────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────\r\n     New England    │          33│          33│       7½‒11│       8 ‒11\r\n   Middle Atlantic  │       15‒33│       15‒33│       7 ‒11│       7 ‒11\r\n   South Atlantic   │          33│          33│       7¾‒11│       8½‒11\r\n East North Central │          33│          33│       6¾‒11│       7½‒11\r\n West North Central │          33│          33│       6 ‒11│       8 ‒11\r\n    South Central   │          33│          33│       7¾‒11│       9 ‒11\r\n    Northwestern    │          36│          36│       5 ‒12│       5 ‒12\r\n    Southwestern    │       20‒36│       20‒36│       6½‒12│       6½‒12\r\n ───────────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────\r\n\r\nPrices of other powdered milk products ranged as follows: Whole milk\r\npowder, 30¢‒58¢ per 1‒lb. can for case goods, and 22¢‒28¢ for goods\r\npacked in barrels; dried buttermilk 10½¢‒12¢ for case goods, and\r\n3½¢‒11¼¢ for goods packed in barrels.\r\n\r\nSkimmed milk powder for export trade was reported sold at 10¢‒11¼¢ per\r\nlb. f. a. s.

Peanuts constitute the most important\r\nexport crop of Senegal, most of the exportable surplus going to England\r\nand France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Fruits ^{and} Vegetables_\r\n          SHIPMENTS CONTINUE HEAVY; WHITE POTATO PRICES SLUMP\r\n  Car-lot Movement So Far This Season about 28,000 Cars Larger than to\r\n                           Same Time in 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\nShipments of 14 lines of fruits and vegetables during the week ending\r\nJuly 29 increased nearly 300 cars over the previous week, having filled\r\n14,531 cars. This is about 930 cars less than during the corresponding\r\nperiod last year, but the total movement of these 14 products this\r\nseason to July 29 is 28,000 cars ahead of last season to the same date.\r\n\r\nWith accumulated supplies in many cities, white potato markets were slow\r\nand weak. A further decrease of 275 cars in last week’s shipments,\r\nhowever, may tend to strengthen this line. Peaches also showed declines\r\nof 50¢-$1 under a peak movement of 2,100 cars. Cantaloupe markets tended\r\nto advance and watermelons were nearly steady, even though shipments of\r\nthe latter crop jumped nearly 500 cars over the preceding week. Movement\r\nof grapes and pears continued to gain, especially from California. The\r\ngrape season is later than usual in central California, but probably\r\n20,000 cars of grapes will come from that territory this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       APPLE SHIPMENTS DECREASE.\r\n\r\nWith the cleaning up of early summer apples, there was a decrease of\r\nnearly 120 cars in the shipments of that commodity. Further losses\r\noccurred in the movement of lettuce and tomatoes; in fact, only 230 cars\r\nof tomatoes were shipped from producing sections compared with 500 cars\r\nthe week before. The only marked increase in lettuce movement was from\r\nColorado. Onion shipments showed a reaction from the previous week and\r\ndecreased to about 300 cars. Movement of sweet potatoes is becoming more\r\nactive as the season advances, and jobbing sales of Alabama stock in\r\nbushel hampers declined 25¢ in Chicago and Cincinnati, closing at\r\n$1‒$1.25.\r\n\r\n_Apples._—California apples are becoming a prominent feature of the\r\nmarket, shipments from that State having been six times greater than the\r\nweek before. Northwestern stock is moving in a small way, Washington\r\ngrowers having forwarded 14 cars and Oregon growers one car last week.\r\nNew York early varieties also started to roll to consuming centers, but\r\nthe season is somewhat later in that section than it was last year.\r\nMichigan shipped more apples than any other State during the week.\r\nVarious varieties from producing districts near Chicago jobbed in that\r\nmarket at 50¢-$l per bu., a decline of nearly $1 a basket. Eastern red\r\napples brought $1‒$1.25 in New York City.\r\n\r\n_Peaches._—Most markets reported heavy arrivals of peaches. St. Louis\r\nreceived 294 cars, Chicago 267 cars, New York 281 cars, and other large\r\neastern cities about 150 cars each. Liberal supplies, combined with much\r\nstock in poor condition, caused the wholesale market for Georgia\r\nElbertas to fall to a level of $2‒$2.75 per crate or bushel basket. Best\r\nElbertas from North Carolina closed at $2.25‒$2.50. Arkansas stock held\r\nfirm in St. Louis at $2‒$2.25 but was weak in Chicago. Shipments from\r\nNorth Carolina were twice as heavy as during the preceding week,\r\ntotaling more than 700 cars. Nearly 1,300 cars have already come from\r\nthat State this season. Arkansas sent almost 600 cars to market during\r\nthe week. Movement from Georgia decreased about 70%, but the season is\r\nbecoming very active in Illinois, Tennessee, and Oklahoma, as well as in\r\nthe Middle Atlantic sections.

Arizona shipped only 60 cars and Imperial Valley 25,\r\ncompared with their combined total of 300 cars the week before. The\r\nTurlock section, however, showed an increase of 100% in movement,\r\nsupplying more cantaloupes than any other producing district.\r\nCantaloupes moved more freely from Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri.\r\nArkansas shipments fell below 100 cars and supplies from the Carolinas\r\nare about cleaned up. In the West, the Las Cruces section of New Mexico\r\nhas become active. Pink Meats from that territory, flats 12’s and 15’s,\r\nbrought $1.15 in Chicago. On the Atlantic coast, Delaware started with a\r\nweekly movement of 60 cars. Maryland furnished almost 400 cars of\r\ncantaloupes, and standard crates of Green Meats from that State jobbed\r\nin Baltimore at $1.25‒$1.50. New York reported sales at a like figure.\r\nIndiana Salmon Tints closed at $1.50‒$2 in Middle Western cities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        POTATO SHIPMENTS HEAVY.\r\n\r\n_White Potatoes._—Wholesale prices of potatoes slumped considerably\r\nduring the week, probably as a result of liberal supplies. Although the\r\nweek’s shipments showed a decrease, arrivals on the New York market were\r\nnearly 550 cars. Chicago received about 400 cars. No. 1 Irish Cobblers\r\nfrom the Eastern Shore of Virginia reached a low point of $1.50 per bbl.\r\nin nearby cities, a loss of $1 or more. At the same time last year the\r\njobbing price was $4‒$4.50. Car-lot sales in Chicago averaged about $3\r\nlast week. Kansas sacked Cobblers, many dirty, closed at $1.15‒$1.25 per\r\n100 lbs. The Chicago range on partly graded Early Ohios was 85¢ for Kaw\r\nValley stock, $1‒$1.15 for Minnesota stock, and $1.25 for Nebraska\r\nstock. New Jersey Cobblers, in 150‒lb. sacks, jobbed at $1.25‒$2 per\r\nsack in important eastern markets.\r\n\r\nJersey shipping points were reported dull and slow at the close of the\r\nweek, although shipments from that section exceeded those from any other\r\nState, having amounted to almost 1,400 cars, compared with 530 the\r\nprevious week. Eastern Shore of Virginia shipments filled only 1,100\r\ncars, a decline of 400, and the Eastern Shore of Maryland marketed less\r\nthan 500 cars of potatoes last week. Movement from Kaw Valley declined\r\nsharply. The season in the Kearney district of Nebraska was not yet in\r\nfull swing.\r\n\r\n_Watermelons._—There was little change in the jobbing price of\r\nwatermelons. Georgia shippers handled 50% more business than during the\r\nweek ending July 22, but the season in that section will not last long.\r\nAs the movement waned in South Carolina it became more active in North\r\nCarolina, about 275 cars having come from the latter State. Southeast\r\nMissouri is coming along fast. From the Sulphur-Springs-Omaha district\r\nof Texas about 1,000 cars of watermelons are expected, and the\r\nWeatherford district may ship 600 cars. Texas melons will be most\r\nabundant the first week of August, rainy weather having delayed the\r\nseason in north Texas.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage._—New York shipped its first car of cabbage last week, as did\r\nMichigan, also. About 80% of the week’s supply, however, came from Iowa\r\nand the Roanoke section of Virginia, each of those sections having\r\nfurnished about 60 cars. Colorado cabbage also is becoming plentiful. In\r\nfive counties of southern Michigan the cabbage acreage is estimated at\r\n1,285 acres, compared with 590 acres in 1921. About 1,400 acres are\r\nreported from Saginaw County in northern Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Special Fruit Trains Bring Berries from Northwest.\r\n\r\nBerries grown in the Puget Sound region of the Northwest are served on\r\nbreakfast tables in Chicago 80 hours after being picked as a result of\r\nthe establishment of a special express refrigerator train service\r\noperating on passenger schedule between the Pacific Northwest and\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nPreviously these fresh fruits were marketed in the locality in which\r\nthey were grown or they were shipped in single cars by express to\r\neastern markets; but in the last few years the development of the berry\r\nindustry has been so rapid in the Northwest that additional outlets had\r\nto be found. The special train service which has been inaugurated is\r\nmeeting this situation very successfully. Berries of various kinds are\r\narriving daily in Chicago from the White Salmon, Yakima, Puyallup, and\r\nWalla Walla valleys, from Vashon Island, Puget Sound, and from Lewiston,\r\nIdaho.\r\n\r\nIn the production centers the berries are rushed by motor truck and\r\ninterurban car to the refrigerator cars on the railroad sidings every\r\nafternoon. The cars are loaded, iced, and hurried on passenger schedule\r\nto Spokane where they are united into a special fruit train. Early in\r\nthe morning the train pulls out from Spokane for the East. These trains\r\nare iced five times between the Pacific coast and Chicago and make no\r\nother stops. Recently train loads of red raspberries have been arriving\r\nin Chicago every day. Loganberries also have been abundant, but the\r\nlarger part of the supply has been raspberries. Arrivals were at the\r\nrate of two cars per day during the latter part of July.\r\n\r\nMost shipments have carried through in fine condition, with only a few\r\npackages showing decay or mold. The berries are all packed in 24‒pt.\r\ncrates which are only a single layer deep, instead of three layers deep\r\nas are the Michigan red raspberries. The quality of the raspberries has\r\nbeen fine, the berries being large and of a desirable red color. A few\r\nblack raspberries, blackberries, and red currants have also come from\r\nthe Northwest, but only as parts of cars. These have likewise been\r\nattractively packed and were of good quality, having shown but little\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\n\r\n               CARLOAD SHIPMENTS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n ─────────────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────\r\n    Commodity.    │        │  Same  │Previous│  This  │  Last  │\r\n                  │  Week  │  week  │  week  │ season │ season │ Total\r\n                  │ ending │  last  │  this  │to July │to July │  last\r\n                  │July 29.│season. │season. │  29.   │  29.   │season.\r\n ─────────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────\r\n Apples           │     521│     542│     639│   3,091│   1,176│  88,544\r\n Cabbage          │     151│     161│     126│  17,208│  12,843│  31,222\r\n Cantaloupes      │   1,801│   1,704│   1,830│  19,268│  16,868│  25,572\r\n Celery           │      55│      35│      65│   5,030│   4,344│  11,642\r\n Grapes           │     108│     167│      62│     207│     337│  37,203\r\n Lettuce          │     302│     334│     329│  16,926│  14,385│  18,300\r\n Onion            │     323│     423│     388│   7,597│   6,669│  20,784\r\n Peaches          │   2,101│   1,600│   1,771│  10,813│  14,353│  27,222\r\n Pears            │     648│     612│     455│   1,216│   1,367│  12,823\r\n Potatoes:        │        │        │        │        │        │\r\n       Sweet      │     139│     135│      84│     347│     165│  19,266\r\n       White      │   3,873│   3,604│   4,147│  46,672│  39,081│ 238,138\r\n Tomatoes         │     230│     339│     498│  17,846│  11,883│  17,204\r\n Vegetables, mixed│     626│     427│     663│  11,013│   9,346│  15,566\r\n Watermelons      │   3,653│   5,377│   3,184│  34,596│  31,106│  46,463\r\n ─────────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────\r\n       Total      │  14,531│  15,460│  14,241│ 191,830│ 163,923│ 609,949\r\n ─────────────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────\r\n\r\n\r\n     Chicago an Important Market for Raspberries and Small Fruits.\r\n\r\nLarge supplies of raspberries and loganberries have recently been\r\narriving on the Chicago market from the Pacific Northwest. Special train\r\nservice has been provided by one of the leading railroads, so that these\r\nhighly perishable fruits come through in record time and in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAccording to reports of a Chicago representative of the U. S. Department\r\nof Agriculture, prices of Northwestern red raspberries have ranged from\r\n$3 per 24‒pt. crate to as high as $4.50 per crate for the best stock at\r\nthe beginning of the season. The average price has been around $3.50‒$4\r\nfor good stock, with a fairly steady market.\r\n\r\nAt this season of the year in Chicago most of the small fruit\r\ncompetition is from Michigan. Heavy supplies of Michigan blackberries,\r\nred raspberries, black raspberries, and blueberries have been coming in\r\nduring July. There has also been a liberal supply of red currants and\r\ngooseberries.

Currants\r\nand gooseberries have varied widely in price. Blueberries have been in\r\ngood demand.\r\n\r\nNew York has shipped a large volume of red currants to Chicago in 32‒qt.\r\ncrates and these have ranged $4‒$6, depending on the quality, condition,\r\nand the market. One car of New York State Columbia red raspberries,\r\nshipped from Clyde, Wayne County, has arrived to date and sold at $3.25\r\nper 48‒pt. crate. This stock was of fine quality but in rather poor\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the sour cherry supply comes from Michigan, packed in\r\n16‒qt. crates and, after the first few Early Richmonds, consists\r\nprincipally of Montmorency and a few English Morello. Wisconsin also\r\nships a few cars of Montmorency in the same package. Odd lots of sweet\r\ncherries in 16‒qt. boxes come from Michigan. These for the most part\r\nvary widely in quality and condition and are not graded well enough or\r\nhandled carefully enough to compete with the well-packed sweet cherries,\r\nprincipally Royal Annes and Bings, from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and\r\nUtah. Most of them are Black Tartarians, Windsors, Bings, and Napoleons\r\n(same cherry as the western Royal Anne). The price has had the\r\nexceedingly wide range of $1‒$3.50 per 16‒qt. crate.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Report on Cabbage and Onions in New York.\r\n\r\nReports from the field service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\nfor the date of July 25 contain the following information concerning\r\ncommercial cabbage and onions in New York:\r\n\r\n_Cabbage._—The acreage planted to cabbage in the eastern portion of the\r\ncabbage belt in Cortland, Chenango, Madison, and eastern Onondaga\r\nCounties and in some sections of the western counties has increased\r\ngreatly over 1921, but for the State as a whole the acreage is probably\r\nnot far from average. The percentage of the acreage in late cabbage is\r\nlarger than usual. Rain has delayed planting and damaged cabbage on low\r\nground but has prevented aphis damage, so that the average condition of\r\nthe crop is good throughout the State.\r\n\r\nNew York ranks first among the States in production of commercial\r\ncabbage and Ontario County first among the counties of the State. This\r\ncounty will begin to ship cabbage by Aug. 15, but most of the crop is\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n_Onions._—Harvesting of early onions in Orange County began July 15, but\r\nthe main crop will move between Aug. 10 and Sept. 1. Best yields may\r\nreach 400 to 500 bus. per acre but rains have reduced the probable\r\naverage for the county to 275 bus. and perhaps to 250 bus.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Growers and Dealers Expect Good Potato Crop in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nGrowers and dealers in the northern and southern potato sections of New\r\nJersey are optimistic over the prospects of this season’s potato crop,\r\naccording to a report from the Philadelphia representative of the market\r\nnews service conducted by the U. S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe weather has been almost ideal from the growing standpoint and\r\nprospects are for the best crop in respect to both quality and quantity\r\nthat New Jersey has had in several years. This is true of all varieties,\r\nbut especially of the Irish Cobblers and the Giants. Thus far the crop\r\nhas been yielding 60‒80 bbls. per acre, mostly around 70 bbls., which is\r\na good yield for so early in the season.\r\n\r\nAlthough some fields, especially in north Jersey (Burlington, Mercer,\r\nand Monmouth Counties), show signs of late blight, this disease does not\r\nappear nearly so prevalent as during the past few years. In south Jersey\r\n(Salem and Cumberland Counties) very little of this disease has\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nThe potato deal in all sections of the State opened generally about July\r\n17. Contrary to custom, it looked as if the northern district would ship\r\nearly potatoes more freely than the southern section. Very little of the\r\nstock seems to have been contracted.\r\n\r\nThere probably will be keen competition this season, especially in north\r\nJersey, because three or four growers’ exchanges besides several large\r\nindividual dealers are interested in the deal. In the southern district\r\nthere is only the one exchange, but there are several large shippers.\r\n\r\nIncreasing quantities of potatoes are moving by truck from producing\r\nsections to New York City, Jersey City, Newark, and especially to the\r\nseashore cities. Many trucks are also being used for shipping to\r\nPennsylvania cities, and the total truck movement probably will affect\r\nthe season’s carlot shipments by several hundred cars. To July 29 about\r\n2,060 cars of potatoes had been reported shipped from New Jersey,\r\ncompared with 1,850 cars to the same date last year. Total shipments\r\nlast season were almost 10,500 cars.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=The close-of-the-season movement= of Maine potatoes was twice as heavy\r\nas in June, 1921. Total shipments from that State have broken all\r\nrecords, amounting to approximately 40,000 carloads, or one-fifth of the\r\nentire late potato shipments of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Grain_\r\n                        WHEAT CONTINUED DOWNWARD\r\nTREND; CORN FAIRLY STEADY Receipts of Wheat Increased—Heavy Export Sales\r\n                   Continued—Oats Prices Dropped Off.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steady decline which has prevailed in the wheat market for some time\r\ncontinued during the week ending July 29 when September wheat at Chicago\r\nclosed at $1.08, 1⅜¢ lower than at the close of the previous week. The\r\nheaviest decline occurred on Monday, when September wheat closed at\r\n$1.07⅜. The market rallied somewhat toward the close of the week but did\r\nnot regain the loss sustained during the early part of the week.\r\n\r\nThe principal bearish factors were the heavy primary receipts, estimated\r\nat 15,902,000 bus., which caused large hedging sales; lower foreign\r\nmarkets; and the weakness in foreign exchange. Opposed to these\r\ninfluences were the bullish reports of heavy export sales and the\r\nreports that more wheat would be needed by foreign buyers than had been\r\ngenerally anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      STRIKE SETTLEMENT A FACTOR.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of an early settlement of the railroad and coal strikes\r\nand a freer movement of grain were also considered by the trade as\r\nfactors that would tend to lower wheat prices.\r\n\r\nAlthough corn and oats prices held fairly firm, the tone of the market\r\nfor these two grains appeared weaker as favorable weather improved the\r\ncrop prospects. The September corn future at Chicago closed at 62½¢ on\r\nJuly 29, compared with 63¼¢ on July 22.\r\n\r\nReceipts of wheat at Chicago were more than 1,000 cars larger than the\r\nprevious week, totaling 3,177 cars, of which 2,583 were winter wheat.\r\nThe movement appears to be about normal, however, as 3,973 cars were\r\nreceived during the corresponding week last year. The quality of the\r\nwheat received was good, about 71% grading Nos. 1 and 2, and 21% grading\r\nNo. 3, leaving only about 8% grading below No. 3.\r\n\r\nMilling demand was slow during the first part of the week but improved\r\nlater. Export demand was active and sales totaling 2,600,000 bus. were\r\nreported made from Chicago to exporters during the week. Premiums of\r\nfrom 24¢ to 47¢ over the September future prices were still being paid\r\nfor cash wheat at Minneapolis. This is a reduction, however, of 1¢ from\r\nthe top and 3¢ from the bottom of the range quoted at the close of the\r\nprevious week. Receipts, especially of good quality, continued light.\r\n\r\nThe danger of rust damage had about passed in the spring wheat territory\r\nas harvesting was well under way. The first car of new spring wheat\r\narrived during the week. Local mills and buyers were not inclined to put\r\nout bids for wheat to arrive. Straight-to-arrive bids for 20‒day\r\ndelivery were being made at the close of the week at 15¢ over the\r\nSeptember price, and for 10‒day delivery at 25¢ over the September.\r\nNorthwestern mills are reported to be operating at about 60% of their\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nIn the Soft Winter wheat section the embargoes placed by the railroads\r\nagainst shipments to the South and Southeast restricted shipments to\r\nmills in that territory. This caused a lighter milling demand at St.\r\nLouis and Cincinnati. At the former market, however, good buying by\r\nelevator interests to cover sales for July and August shipments, and by\r\nexporters for direct shipment to the Gulf, kept the market firm.\r\nReceipts were 1,161 cars, most of which were Soft Winter.\r\n\r\nAbout 82% of the 177 cars of Soft Winter wheat received at Cincinnati\r\ngraded No. 3 or better, principally because of test weight, and was of\r\ngood milling quality. Prices were firm notwithstanding the curtailment\r\nof outbound shipments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    EXPORTERS ACTIVE AT KANSAS CITY.\r\n\r\nReceipts at Kansas City totaled 3,443 cars. The movement from the\r\ncountry was large and is expected to continue in good volume for some\r\ntime. Milling demand was only fair. Eastern mills took only small lots\r\nand Northwestern mills also bought on a small scale because of the\r\npromising outlook for Spring wheat. There was an excellent export\r\ndemand, however, and very active bidding was indulged in by exporters to\r\nthe Gulf who were eager to obtain wheat to fill sales for shipment. Bids\r\nfor wheat for August delivery were made as high as 17¢ per bu. over the\r\nChicago September future price but later were reduced to 15¢ premium.\r\nBids for September loading at the Gulf were made at 13¢ over the Chicago\r\nSeptember price.\r\n\r\nThe activity in the export market was especially noticeable at the\r\nAtlantic seaboard markets, as the failure of shippers to make delivery\r\non July contracts compelled many exporters to buy in the open market to\r\nfill the ocean tonnage already engaged. A number of boats were loaded at\r\ntwo or more ports in order to get sufficient wheat for the cargoes.\r\nThere was a good demand for Hard Winter for various continental markets,\r\nfor Red Winter for France, and for Hard Winter and Durum wheat for\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CORN PRICES FAIRLY STEADY.\r\n\r\nAlthough future prices were slightly lower and crop prospects were good,\r\ncash corn prices held fairly steady to firm. Receipts were about normal.\r\nShipping orders and export sales absorbed the offerings readily at the\r\nprincipal markets. Primary receipts were estimated at 5,474,000 bus.\r\ncompared with 4,464,000 bus. last year. Primary shipments were 8,510,000\r\nbus. compared with 5,251,000 bus. a year ago, thus indicating a\r\nrelatively better demand at present than at the corresponding time last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nLake shipments to American ports from Chicago during the week were\r\n2,072,000 bus.\r\n\r\n                   (Concluded on page 116, column 3.)\r\n\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n                             GRAIN EXPORTS.\r\n\r\n   Wheat Inspected Out under American Grades Only.

Eastern markets were experiencing\r\nthe mid-season dullness, while central western markets were having some\r\ndifficulty in disposing of the increasing receipts of new hay, much of\r\nwhich was not of desirable quality for shipment. The railroad strike was\r\nreported as curtailing shipments in some sections, but generally the\r\neffects of the strike were not noticeable in the markets. The average\r\nprice of hay was lowered slightly during the week, but the larger\r\ndeclines were in the eastern markets, where prices were being worked to\r\na new hay basis.\r\n\r\nReceipts were lighter in the East but heavier in the West, as is shown\r\nin the following table, which gives receipts in carloads at several\r\nimportant markets for the weeks ending July 22 and July 29, 1922 and\r\nJuly 30, 1921:\r\n\r\n\r\n          ─────────────────────┬───────────────────┬─────────\r\n                  City.        │       1922        │  1921\r\n          ─────────────────────┼─────────┬─────────┼─────────\r\n                               │July 29. │July 22. │July 30.\r\n          ─────────────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n          Boston               │       39│       30│\r\n          New York             │      173│      280│      192\r\n          Philadelphia         │       69│       41│\r\n          Pittsburgh           │       44│       29│\r\n          Cincinnati           │      188│      113│      146\r\n          Chicago              │      258│      191│      228\r\n          Minneapolis-St. Paul │      208│      141│       54\r\n          St. Louis            │      121│       88│\r\n          Kansas City          │      360│      330│\r\n          Los Angeles          │       48│       84│      224\r\n          San Francisco        │      138│         │      253\r\n          ─────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TIMOTHY LOWER IN EAST.\r\n\r\n_Timothy._—Notwithstanding the light receipts, prices declined\r\n$1.50‒$2.50 per ton on No. 1 timothy hay at New York and Boston during\r\nthe week. Very little good hay was offered and the poorer grades were\r\nnot wanted. Buyers appeared to prefer to await larger receipts of new\r\nhay. The few cars of new hay arriving were mostly No. 3 or lower and\r\nsome were heating. Light receipts caused firm prices most of the week at\r\nPhiladelphia and good old hay was in demand at Pittsburgh. New hay, most\r\nof which graded No. 2, sold at $5 discount under old No. 1 prices at the\r\nlatter market.\r\n\r\nGood quality old hay and new cool, sweet hay sold readily at Chicago,\r\nbut the poorer grades, of which there was an oversupply, sold at heavy\r\ndiscounts. Southside yards were congested with off-grade hay. Nearly all\r\nthe new hay was reported to be overripe and of poor color. Many cars\r\nwere heating, also.\r\n\r\nThe timothy market developed an easier tone at both Cincinnati and St.\r\nLouis. The local demand was limited and prices were said to be too high\r\nto stimulate a shipping demand to the South and Southeast. There was,\r\nhowever, very little inquiry from the southern markets, as Johnson grass\r\nand other local hays were on the market in good supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ALFALFA MOVEMENT LIGHT.\r\n\r\n_Alfalfa._—The movement of alfalfa from Kansas and other Southwestern\r\nStates was comparatively light, as the second crop of alfalfa was much\r\nsmaller than the first because of the hot, dry weather which recently\r\nprevailed in that territory. The shortage of water in some sections will\r\nalso probably cause a lighter yield of the third crop so that producers\r\nare not inclined to sell their stocks at prices unsatisfactory to them.\r\nKansas City reported a more active demand from the cotton belt as well\r\nas from the local dairy trade.\r\n\r\nAdvances in prices for all grades were reported from Los Angeles where\r\nreceipts were light. Choice rabbit hay sold as high as $25 per ton.\r\nReceipts at San Francisco were heavier and prices were much lower than\r\nat the southern market.\r\n\r\n_Prairie._—Prairie hay constituted the bulk of the receipts at\r\nMinneapolis and Kansas City. Dealers and consumers who had accumulated\r\nlarge stocks of hay in expectation of a curtailed supply because of the\r\nrail strike were not interested and the market ruled dull. The\r\nstockyards offered the principal outlet at Minneapolis. Country supplies\r\nof prairie were reported heavy and little improvement in the market was\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n_Straw._—Receipts of straw were light but equal to the demand in most\r\nmarkets. Some old rye straw was wanted in eastern markets. There was an\r\noversupply of wheat straw at Chicago. Current quotations were as\r\nfollows: No. 1 wheat—Boston (old) $19, Baltimore $12, Pittsburgh $13.50,\r\nChicago $9, Cincinnati $10.50, Richmond $12; No. 1 oat—Boston (old) $20,\r\nBaltimore $12.50, Pittsburgh $13.50, Chicago $11.50, Cincinnati $10.50;\r\nNo. 1 rye (straight)—Boston (new) $30, New York (new) $22, Baltimore\r\n$30; No. 1 rye (tangled)—Pittsburgh $13.50, Chicago $13, Cincinnati $11.\r\n\r\n\r\n         MILL FEED MARKETS DISPLAYED WEAK TENDENCY DURING WEEK\r\n         Heavy Production of Wheat Feeds Cause of Rather Large\r\n                    Accumulations—Alfalfa Meal Firm.\r\n\r\nThe mill feed market was in a weak position during the week ending July\r\n29. Increased production and offerings of the more important feedstuffs\r\nwith no material improvement in the demand from principal feeding\r\nsections resulted in an easier feeling and lower quotations, especially\r\nfor bran and cottonseed meal.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the week the market held steady, but as soon as\r\nproduction figures became more generally known buyers turned resellers\r\nand endeavored to realize profits on their long contracts. During the\r\nlast few days of the week trading was practically at a standstill, with\r\nsellers anxious to dispose of nearby shipment stuff. Stocks in hands of\r\ninterior dealers were thought to be fairly good for this season of the\r\nyear and advices indicate that they are being disposed of only slowly.\r\nThe movement was fair.\r\n\r\n_Wheat mill feeds._—Bran was easily the weakest of the wheat mill feeds\r\nand on heavy offerings declined to $14 in the Minneapolis market.\r\nStandard middlings and the heavy wheat feeds held slightly better, flour\r\nmiddlings and reddog of ordinary quality commanding $24.50 and $29.50,\r\nrespectively, in that market. Production in southwestern and\r\nnorthwestern mills increased substantially and an easier market\r\nprevailed. Most of the markets quoted bran $1‒$2 lower than last week.\r\nThe movement\r\n\r\n                   (Concluded on page 116, column 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  CARLOAD PRICES OF HAY AND FEED AT IMPORTANT

Completed in Many Sections—Quality This Year Better\r\n                               than Last\r\n\r\nThe movement of orchard grass seed is even more belated than last year\r\ndespite the fact that it was harvested earlier. In some sections but\r\nlittle seed had been thrashed up to July 25 and in other sections\r\nthrashing operations were in full swing or nearly completed.\r\n\r\nAs was pointed out in the June 24 issue of WEATHER, CROPS, AND MARKETS,\r\nthe 1922 crop is much larger than that of last year and sales were\r\nsomewhat disappointing this spring. These factors along with others have\r\ntended to cause dealers to take a passive interest in the crop and\r\nrefrain from making any but nominal bids for seed held by growers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MARKET NOT YET MADE.\r\n\r\nThe market had not become established by July 25, although prices for\r\ncountry-run seed ranging from 75¢ to $1.25 per 100 lbs. were being\r\noffered occasionally to growers in the Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri\r\ndistricts. Thrashing had not progressed sufficiently in Virginia for\r\nbuyers to become interested in the seed that was harvested in that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the 1922 crop in practically all districts is considered\r\nto be better than last year. The carryover of old seed by growers,\r\nparticularly in the Ohio and Virginia districts, seems to be somewhat\r\nlarger than usual. No orchard grass seed was permitted entry under the\r\nseed importation act during June and July.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeadow Fescue Seed Prices Decline During Past Two Weeks.\r\n\r\nA normal movement of the 1922 crop of meadow fescue seed has occurred\r\nsince thrashing began about June 30, and it is estimated that\r\napproximately 55% of the crop has already been sold by growers. In the\r\nopinion of country buyers and others this year’s crop of recleaned seed\r\nwill be about twice as large as that of last year.\r\n\r\nThe quality is considered to be much better not only because of\r\nfavorable weather during the growing season and at harvest time but also\r\nbecause growers exercised more care in the selection of their seed for\r\nsowing. During recent years the shrinkage in recleaning the crop has\r\nbeen unusually heavy, resulting in considerable loss to the growers.\r\n\r\nPrices to growers declined 2¢ or 3¢ during the two weeks prior to July\r\n25. Only about 4¢ per lb. for recleaned seed was being paid on that\r\ndate, and there were not many buyers even at that price.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=A new variety of the Rose potato=, called the Early Norther Rose, was\r\nplanted in the Charleston section of South Carolina this spring. It\r\nresembles the Spaulding Rose, but is a little longer and thicker than\r\nthat variety. The average yield was 80‒90 bbls. per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n           MOVEMENT OF KENTUCKY BLUE GRASS SEED BELOW NORMAL\r\nGrowers in Kentucky Have Pooled Much of Their Seed——Quality Better than\r\n                               Last Year.\r\n\r\nThe 1922 crop of Kentucky blue grass seed is not being sold so freely by\r\ngrowers in Kentucky and Missouri as was the crop last year. In some\r\nimportant stripping areas in Kentucky where the crop is large, less than\r\n5% had moved from growers’ hands by July 25. In other sections of\r\nKentucky approximately 25% had been sold but the bulk of the crop has\r\nbeen pooled in the expectancy of higher prices later. Although in the\r\nvicinity of one or two important shipping points in Missouri 60% or more\r\nof the crop is reported to have been sold by growers, in most of the\r\nother sections only 10%‒15% has been sold.\r\n\r\nPrices prevailing about July 25 were much lower than last year, being\r\nmostly $1.25‒$1.50 per bu. for rough, cured seed compared with $2‒$2.50\r\nlast year. Little or no change occurred in prices offered to growers\r\nduring the last two weeks of July.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the seed in Kentucky and Missouri is much better than it\r\nwas last year and undoubtedly will shrink less in cleaning.\r\n\r\nThe production of the 1922 crop was covered fully in the June 17 issue\r\nof this publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     IMPORTS OF FORAGE PLANT SEEDS.\r\n\r\n                     Permitted Entry Under the Seed\r\n                            Importation Act.\r\n\r\n                ──────────────────┬─────────────────────\r\n                  Kind of seed.   │        July.\r\n                ──────────────────┼──────────┬──────────\r\n                                  │  1922.   │  1921.\r\n                ──────────────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n                                  │ Pounds.  │ Pounds.\r\n                Alfalfa           │ 1,553,100│    89,200\r\n                Canada bluegrass  │          │     1,000\r\n                Alsike clover     │    44,300│    17,800\r\n                Crimson clover    │    11,000│   198,200\r\n                Red clover        │   185,800│   744,500\r\n                White clover      │    79,000│   133,600\r\n                Grass mixtures    │          │    40,100\r\n                Broom corn millet │   153,400│\r\n                Rape              │   366,700│    38,500\r\n                Redtop            │     2,200│\r\n                English rye grass │    84,000│    16,300\r\n                Italian rye grass │          │    13,800\r\n                Timothy           │          │    89,200\r\n                Hairy vetch       │    91,900│   108,400\r\n                Spring vetch      │    10,800│\r\n                ══════════════════╧══════════╧══════════\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WEEKLY FEED TRADE REVIEW.\r\n\r\n                       (Concluded from page 115.)\r\n\r\nwas fair: Embargoes against outbound shipping in a few western markets\r\nkept business within narrow limits. Stocks generally were in excess of\r\nthe demand.\r\n\r\nSouthwestern markets reported a good demand for shorts from the South\r\nand Southeast and an improved inquiry for bran was noted from Pacific\r\ncoast markets. Large stocks of wheat feeds, mostly bought at higher\r\nlevels, are being carried at western lake ports, and railroads are not\r\naccepting any more shipments to be held at lake ports, claiming that all\r\navailable space is occupied.\r\n\r\n_Cottonseed meal and cake._—Increased offerings of new crop cottonseed\r\ncake and meal gave the market an unsettled tone and although a fair\r\ndemand was noted in the East the premiums of old crop over the new crop\r\ncake and meal were sharply lowered. Prices for October shipment stuff\r\nruled about $5 per ton lower than spot offerings in most markets.\r\nPressure of new crop offers for deferred shipment tended to check\r\nbuying. A small volume of business on the basis of $40 at Kansas City\r\nfor 43% stock was noted, but buyers generally were hesitant in taking\r\nhold. Old crop stocks at mills continue in excess of what they were last\r\nyear. The export inquiry was light. The movement was small.\r\n\r\n_Linseed meal and cake._—Production of linseed meal and cake was light.\r\nPrices held steady, but showed a rather wide range, mill offerings being\r\nat 50¢-$1 per ton less than was asked by jobbers. Stocks were fair. The\r\ndemand both for export and domestic consumption was poor. Crushers\r\nexpect increased production during September and October but little\r\nimprovement in the output is expected during August. Receipts and\r\nmovement were light.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GLUTEN FEED DEMAND QUIET.\r\n\r\n_Gluten feed._—The demand for gluten feed was quiet. Dealers reported\r\nsales as slow, and as a result a few mills experienced difficulty in\r\nobtaining shipping instructions for goods bought for July shipment.\r\nAlthough corn prices were lower and No. 2 Yellow was quoted on the basis\r\nof about $22 Chicago, gluten feed for August shipment was advanced $1\r\nper ton over the July price to $29.85 per ton Chicago. Production was\r\nnormal and the movement was good. Supplies were rather large in the\r\nNortheast, and moderate in other sections.\r\n\r\n_Hominy feed._—Hominy feed prices showed little change from last week.\r\nEastern mills shaded prices to effect sales. The demand was scattered\r\nand mostly from single car buyers. Production was good, particularly by\r\nmills having orders for grits for the Russian Relief. Offerings by\r\nwestern mills increased because of the limited sales during the past\r\nmonth and the accumulation of stocks. Supplies in dealers’ hands\r\ncontinued fair. The movement was light.\r\n\r\n_Alfalfa meal._—The supply of alfalfa meal was about equal to the\r\ndemand, which was normal for this time of the year, inquiries having\r\nbeen received from all over the country. Prices for meal are governed\r\nlargely by trend of hay prices, and as the yield of second cutting in\r\nmany instances was less than was expected, with poor prospects for the\r\nthird cutting, the alfalfa meal situation was quite firm. The supplies\r\nof hay available for milling have been reduced considerably through\r\nextensive purchases by sheep feeders. Millers, therefore, do not expect\r\nto make heavy offerings in the near future. In fact, many mills were\r\nunable to accept business for immediate, quick, or prompt shipment. The\r\nmovement was fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      WEEKLY GRAIN MARKET REVIEW.\r\n\r\n                       (Concluded from page 114.)\r\n\r\nand to Canadian ports 1,431,000 bus. Total shipments for the season to\r\nCanadian ports stand at 11,757,000 bus.\r\n\r\nIncreased offerings of oats caused prices to decline 1¢ to 2¢ per bu.\r\nduring the week. The demand was light because buyers were expecting new\r\ncrop prices to be lower. The general movement was not large, however, as\r\ntotal primary receipts were only 4,775,000 bus., or not quite one-half\r\nof the amount reported received during the corresponding week last year.\r\n\r\nThe visible supply of grain at the close of the week was given as\r\nfollows: Oats, 36,667,000 bus.; corn, 19,509,000 bus.; and wheat,\r\n19,667,000 bus. Wheat and flour on ocean passage totaled 48,936,000\r\nbus., compared with 57,960,000 bus. one year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Cotton_\r\n            PRICES SAG DURING WEEK; SPOT SALES SHOW INCREASE\r\n Reports of More Favorable Weather in the Main Cotton States Was Factor\r\n                               in Market.\r\n\r\nThe week ending July 29 witnessed sagging prices in cotton, due\r\nprimarily to reports of more favorable weather for the growing crop.\r\nBoth the railroad and coal strikes had their effect, and the unsettled\r\ncondition in foreign exchange was also a factor.\r\n\r\nThe average price of Middling as determined from the quotations of the\r\n10 designated spot markets closed at 21.69¢ per lb. on July 29, compared\r\nwith 22.10¢ at the close of the previous week and 10.81¢ for the\r\ncorresponding day last year. The decline in October future contracts on\r\nthe New York Cotton Exchange amounted to 38 points, and on the New\r\nOrleans Cotton Exchange to 39 points. October future contracts on the\r\nLiverpool Cotton Association closed at 12.24d. per lb. on July 28,\r\ncompared with 12.59d. at the close of the previous week and 8.39d. for\r\nthe corresponding day last year.\r\n\r\nThe volume of spot sales as reported by the cotton exchanges in the 10\r\ndesignated markets was somewhat larger than the previous week, amounting\r\nto 29,057 bales, compared with 26,939 bales the previous week and 29,715\r\nbales for the corresponding period in 1921. The total sales reported by\r\nthe exchanges in the 10 designated spot markets from Aug. 1 to July 29\r\namounted to 3,361,605 bales, compared with 3,303,552 bales for the\r\ncorresponding period last season.\r\n\r\nDullness was reported to have developed in the dry goods trade, but with\r\nlittle change in the price levels as compared with those of the previous\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Closing Future Prices for July 29 and for the Corresponding Days in\r\n                            1921 and 1920.\r\n\r\n ─────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────\r\n  Month.  │          New York.          │        New Orleans.\r\n ─────────┼─────────┬─────────┬─────────┼─────────┬─────────┬─────────\r\n          │  1922   │  1921   │  1920   │  1922   │  1921   │  1920\r\n ─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n          │_Cents._ │_Cents._ │_Cents._ │_Cents._ │_Cents._ │_Cents._\r\n October  │    21.42│    12.14│    31.27│    20.96│    11.66│    30.31\r\n December │    21.35│    12.65│    30.00│    20.85│    12.00│    29.35\r\n January  │    21.21│    12.60│    29.18│    20.81│    12.08│    28.90\r\n March    │    21.18│    12.95│    28.90│    20.71│    12.40│    28.50\r\n May      │    21.05│    13.08│    28.50│    20.60│    12.47│    27.90\r\n ─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Spot\r\n                              Quotations\r\n                                  for\r\n                               Middling\r\n                                Upland\r\n                               Cotton at\r\n                              New York on\r\n                               July 29,\r\n                              for Each of\r\n                              the Past 32\r\n                                Years.\r\n\r\n                              ───────────\r\n                                   Cents.\r\n                              1891   8.00\r\n                              1892   7.50\r\n                              1893   8.12\r\n                              1894   7.00\r\n                              1895   7.00\r\n                              1896   7.31\r\n                              1897   7.94\r\n                              1898   6.06\r\n                              1899   6.12\r\n                              1900  10.06\r\n                              1901   8.12\r\n                              1902   9.06\r\n                              1903  13.25\r\n                              1904  10.70\r\n                              1905  11.05\r\n                              1906  10.90\r\n                              1907  12.90\r\n                              1908  10.70\r\n                              1909  12.75\r\n                              1910  16.05\r\n                              1911  13.50\r\n                              1912  13.25\r\n                              1913  11.95\r\n                              1914  12.75\r\n                              1915   9.35\r\n                              1916  13.30\r\n                              1917  25.20\r\n                              1918  28.55\r\n                              1919  35.15\r\n                              1920  40.00\r\n                              1921  11.95\r\n                              1922  21.75\r\n                              ───────────\r\n\r\n\r\n               Cotton Movement from August 1 to July 28.\r\n\r\n                 [Information from commercial sources.]\r\n\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┬───────────\r\n                                             │  1921‒22  │  1920‒21\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────\r\n                                             │ _Bales._  │ _Bales._\r\n   Port receipts                             │  6,084,471│  6,713,411\r\n   Port stocks                               │    499,345│  1,347,936\r\n   Interior receipts                         │  7,224,067│  7,546,577\r\n   Interior stocks                           │    388,830│  1,129,231\r\n   Into sight                                │           │ 11,565,262\r\n   Northern spinners’ takings                │           │  2,088,516\r\n   Southern spinners’ takings                │  4,126,522│  2,874,678\r\n   World’s visible supply of American cotton │  2,021,888│  4,108,428\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┴───────────\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SPOT COTTON QUOTATIONS.\r\n\r\n  Price of Middling spot cotton for July 29 and the commercial\r\n    differences in price between Middling and other grades of American\r\n    Upland cotton at each of the 10 markets named, together with the\r\n    total number of bales sold during the week ending July 29, as\r\n    reported to the U.

The imports from Australia and New Zealand combined\r\namounted to 445,466,900 lbs., compared with only 251,225,300 lbs. during\r\nthe first six months of 1921, while the imports from British South\r\nAfrica increased from 56,904,600 lbs. in the first half of 1921 to\r\n110,333,300 lbs. in the first half of 1922.

The rainfall was\r\nespecially beneficial for growing crops in Iowa, much of South Dakota,\r\nportions of Kansas, and parts of the Ohio Valley States. Vegetation was\r\nimproved also in the northwestern Plains area and in many sections of\r\nthe central Rocky Mountain States.\r\n\r\nShowers brought some relief in the far Southwest, particularly in\r\nportions of Arizona and northern New Mexico, but other localities in\r\nthat area were still in need of rain. Very little rain occurred from the\r\nlower Great Plains southward and the high temperatures in that area were\r\naccompanied in some localities by destructive hot winds. Late truck\r\nneeded rain also in some other Southern States. Farm work made good\r\nprogress generally, except for some delay, principally in north Central\r\nStates, caused by heavy rainfall. Roads were mostly in good condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THRASHING SOMEWHAT RETARDED.\r\n\r\n_Small grains._—There was considerable rainfall during the week in many\r\nlocalities of the North Central States, and thrashing of small grains\r\nwas retarded in this section. There was some injury to grain in shock\r\nalso in portions of the upper Mississippi Valley, particularly in Iowa.\r\nEast of the Mississippi River this work made generally good progress\r\nunder favorable weather conditions, while harvesting of late grain and\r\nthrashing progressed rapidly in the far Northwestern States. Plowing for\r\nfall seeding showed progress in the lower Missouri Valley, the north\r\ncentral Great Plains States, and in some Ohio Valley districts, with the\r\nsoil mostly in good condition.\r\n\r\nReports of black rust in spring wheat continued from the central and\r\neastern portions of North Dakota, but the crop was too far advanced to\r\nsuffer serious damage. There was some local damage by hail in Minnesota,\r\nand the condition of spring wheat is variable in that State, though on\r\nthe whole it is generally fair. The crop was largely harvested in South\r\nDakota and some thrashing was done with fair yields with the grain of\r\ngood to excellent quality.\r\n\r\nOat and barley harvests continued in the Northeastern States, and\r\nthrashing progressed in the Ohio Valley region. The yields in the latter\r\narea were mostly disappointing. Considerable oats in shock were damaged\r\nin Iowa by molding, rotting, and sprouting due to wet weather. Oats were\r\nbenefited in many of the later western districts by the showers of the\r\nweek. Flax was reported in mostly good condition in South Dakota. Rice\r\ndid well in California and the condition and progress of this crop was\r\nreported as good in Texas. Harvest of the early rice crop was in\r\nprogress in Louisiana.\r\n\r\n_Corn._—The rainfall in the central and upper Mississippi Valley, much\r\nof the Great Plains area, and in localities of the Ohio Valley was very\r\nbeneficial to corn. The late crop, however, in the lower Great Plains,\r\nin Texas, and some other southern localities needed rain badly. The\r\ncondition and development of the crop were reported as excellent in all\r\nsections of Missouri and fair to very good in Iowa. Moderately heavy\r\nrains occurred in the last-named State, especially in the western\r\nportion, where moisture had been badly needed. The progress of the crop\r\nwas very good in Illinois, fair to very good in Indiana generally,\r\nalthough it needed rain in the eastern portion of the latter State. Corn\r\nwas in good condition in Ohio but needed rain in many places.\r\n\r\nThe crop was favorably affected by the weather in the Middle Atlantic\r\nStates and was doing well in northeastern districts. The nights\r\ncontinued too cool for best development of this crop in the western\r\nupper Lake region, where growth was backward. Fields were uneven but\r\ngenerally fair and showed some improvement in Minnesota. Corn had mostly\r\ntasseled out to the extreme north central portion of the country. Broom\r\ncorn was damaged by drought in the southern Great Plains, especially in\r\nwestern Oklahoma.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MOSTLY FAVORABLE FOR COTTON.\r\n\r\n_Cotton._—Cotton was favorably affected by the weather of the week\r\nexcept where there was a lack of moisture in the more western portion of\r\nthe belt and where it was too wet in a few central and eastern\r\nlocalities. Moderate rainfall was the rule from the Mississippi Valley\r\neastward, but to the westward little or no rain fell. Temperatures were\r\nsomewhat above normal in the central and eastern districts and were\r\nunusually high in the northwestern portion of the belt. Sunshine was\r\ngenerally ample except in northeastern localities.\r\n\r\nThe crop made favorable progress in North Carolina, except where it was\r\ntoo wet in parts of the coastal plain. The weather was generally\r\nfavorable in South Carolina, although there was too much moisture in\r\nsome central counties and the plants were reported as sappy with some\r\nshedding, but fruiting fairly well generally. The week was very\r\nfavorable for cotton in Georgia where very good to excellent progress\r\nwas reported, and generally fair advance was indicated from Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe progress was very good in the northern and southern portions of\r\nMississippi but less favorable where the rainfall was heavier in the\r\ncentral portion. Cotton showed very good development in Louisiana and\r\nmost of Arkansas, the warm, dry weather being favorable in the latter\r\nState. Conditions were less favorable, however, in Texas and Oklahoma.\r\nPeanuts were shedding in the former State as a result of warm, dry\r\nweather, although the early planted crop continued in fair to good\r\ncondition. The progress of the peanut crop in Texas was poor to only\r\nfair, and progress and condition were fair in Oklahoma although the\r\nplants needed rain badly in the western portion where wilting and\r\nshedding were reported.\r\n\r\nWeevils were generally less active, particularly in the western portion\r\nof the belt, although they continued numerous in most sections and were\r\ndoing considerable damage in many localities. Bolls were reported as\r\nopening rapidly in southern Georgia and picking progressed favorably.\r\nThe weather was very favorable for this work in the southern portion of\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes._—White potatoes made generally good progress throughout the\r\ncountry during the week. Showers were beneficial for the crop in many\r\nportions of the Rocky Mountain and Plateau States, except in local areas\r\nwhere unirrigated potatoes needed more moisture. Some damage from\r\ndisease and insects was reported from comparatively small areas in the\r\nnorthwestern Lake region and the crop was injured in portions of the\r\nlower Great Plains by heat and drought. In some sections of the middle\r\nAtlantic coast area more moisture would have been beneficial. Digging\r\nwas in progress northward to the Lake region. Planting continued in\r\nportions of the Southeast. Sweet potatoes did well generally and were\r\nreported as making excellent growth, except in Florida where they needed\r\nmore rain.\r\n\r\n_Truck and miscellaneous crops._—With sufficient moisture in most of the\r\ninterior Valley States, truck crops and gardens showed improvement,\r\nalthough they were damaged in portions of the Ohio Valley States by lack\r\nof moisture. They were unfavorably affected in a few localities of the\r\neast Gulf area. Rain was badly needed in the Southwest and unirrigated\r\ntruck was suffering in the far Northwest.\r\n\r\nSugar beets improved in Colorado and were doing well in Utah, Wyoming,\r\nand Nebraska. The weather was favorable for tobacco in the Northeast,\r\nbut this crop was injured by drought in portions of Kentucky and plants\r\nwere yellowing in places in Ohio because of insufficient moisture. The\r\nweather was favorable for checking rust in the Ohio Valley localities.\r\nSugar cane was doing well in the lower Mississippi Valley, but cane and\r\npeanuts were needing rain in Florida. In Virginia peanuts were reported\r\nas small and the fields grassy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       RAINS HELP WESTERN RANGES.\r\n\r\n_Meadows, pastures, and stock._—Alfalfa was benefited by local showers\r\nin the Central Plateau area and meadows and pastures were improved in\r\nmany interior Valley States, although moisture was needed in some\r\nsections. Considerable rain fell over the northern and northwestern\r\nGreat Plains and in the central Rocky Mountain districts, resulting in\r\nmaterial improvement to ranges. There were also local showers in the far\r\nSouthwest, which were beneficial, but only partial relief was brought to\r\nNew Mexico, where much of the range was still slowly deteriorating and\r\nstock was thin. Ranges were further unfavorably affected by lack of\r\nrainfall in Texas, and pastures were mostly burned dry in central\r\nOklahoma. More rain was needed in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, but\r\npastures continued very good in the Middle Atlantic States and the\r\nNortheast. Pastures were reported short in Michigan, and while still\r\ngood in Wisconsin they needed rain in many localities. Ranges were in\r\npoor condition in Minnesota.\r\n\r\n_Fruit._—There was some damage to fruit by heat and lack of moisture in\r\nOklahoma, and some harm resulted locally from high winds in Missouri.\r\nApples and prunes would have been benefited by rain in some of the more\r\nnorthwestern States. Otherwise the weather conditions were generally\r\nfavorable for fruit in practically all sections of the country. Prunes\r\nand olives were sizing up nicely in California; oranges were fair to\r\ngood in that State; but lemons were less satisfactory because of last\r\nwinter’s freeze. Strawberry plants were favorably affected in Florida\r\nand citrus fruits were in good condition.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=The Mexican bean beetle= was reported as a serious pest from several\r\ncounties in Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Warm in Southwest during Week.\r\n\r\nModerate midsummer temperatures prevailed in most sections of the\r\ncountry during the week, except for unusually warm weather in some south\r\ncentral districts. Maximum temperatures were frequently above 100° in\r\nOklahoma, western Arkansas, and northern Texas, the highest reported in\r\nthis area being 104° at Oklahoma City on July 26. Chart 1, page 120,\r\nshows that for the week as a whole the temperature averaged below normal\r\nin the Northeast, some north central localities, and in most sections\r\nwest of the Rocky Mountains. Elsewhere the weekly averages were above\r\nnormal, being decidedly above normal in the lower Great Plains section.\r\n\r\nRainfall was generally of a local character during the week, with light\r\nto moderate, and in a few instances heavy, showers reported generally\r\nfrom the Mississippi Valley eastward, as shown by Chart 2, page 120.\r\nGood rains occurred in the northwestern Great Plains, but little or none\r\nwas received from the southern Plains southward.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Average August Weather.\r\n\r\nThe last two columns of the table on this page show the normal\r\ntemperature and precipitation for the month of August at the various\r\nWeather Bureau stations throughout the country. The average temperature\r\nfor August differs but little from that of July, although as a rule\r\nAugust is slightly cooler except on the Pacific coast. East of the Rocky\r\nMountains the coolest August weather usually occurs in the upper Lake\r\nregion and the Northeastern States, where the monthly normals are about\r\n62° to 65°. The normals are slightly above 80° in much of the Gulf coast\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nRainfall in August is frequently of a local character, resulting largely\r\nfrom thunderstorms. The highest monthly averages for August vary from 6\r\nins. to more than 8 ins. and occur in the more southeastern States. The\r\ndry season continues over the Pacific Coast States and little or no rain\r\nis expected, except for occasional showers in the mountains and in the\r\nmore northern districts. Thunderstorms during August are usually more\r\nfrequent along the east Gulf coast than in any other section of the\r\ncountry, occurring on the average on about 20 days during the month.\r\nThey are usually active also during this month in the far Southwest,\r\nthis being within the season of maximum rainfall in Arizona and New\r\nMexico and portions of the adjoining States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Irish Flax Industry Failing.\r\n\r\nThe Irish flax industry is threatened with extinction, according to a\r\nreport from the American Consul at Belfast. The area under flax for the\r\npresent year amounts to only 25,000 acres, compared with 40,000 acres in\r\n1921 and 127,193 acres in 1920.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Department of Agriculture has been urged to formulate and\r\nadopt a scheme for the improvement and maintenance of this staple\r\nindustry of Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Mississippi Tomato Shipments.\r\n\r\nMississippi’s tomato output has grown by leaps and bounds. In the spring\r\nof 1920 there were 1,360 cars shipped from that State. The 1921 movement\r\nwas 1,960 cars, and this season the shipments filled approximately 3,450\r\ncars.\r\n\r\n\r\n ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n
