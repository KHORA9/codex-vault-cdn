Already\r\nthere have been surprises and puzzles that paint a completely new\r\npicture of Saturn and its neighborhood, including the discovery of three\r\nnew moons, startling information about Saturn’s rings, and observation\r\nof the unexpectedly complex structure of Saturn’s atmosphere and that of\r\nits largest moon, Titan. It will take years for scientists to assimilate\r\ncompletely the information which is cascading down from Voyager. What\r\nmore will this marvel of technology have to tell us before it departs\r\nthe solar system to travel endlessly among the stars?\r\n\r\n                                       Robert A.

In slightly over two decades, man has ingeniously explored\r\nfive distant planets—and two dozen moons. We have seen their weather and\r\nsurfaces, landed on some, probed the atmospheres of others, and listened\r\nto their radio noises.\r\n\r\nUnder the planetary exploration program of the National Aeronautics and\r\nSpace Administration, the Voyager Mission, begun in 1972, was designed\r\nto explore Jupiter, Saturn, their satellites, rings, magnetic fields,\r\nand interplanetary space. Two automated, reprogrammable spacecraft,\r\nVoyagers 1 and 2, were launched in late summer of 1977. Their goals: the\r\nouter planets.\r\n\r\nBoth spacecraft made astounding discoveries in the Jupiter system in\r\n1979—a thin ring, a thick ionized sulfur and oxygen torus, an actively\r\nvolcanic satellite—these were but a few of the treasures yielded by the\r\ntwo Jupiter flybys.\r\n\r\nNow, Voyager 1 has completed exploration of its final target: the ringed\r\nplanet Saturn and its enigmatic giant satellite, Titan. True to the\r\ngenerally unpredictable nature of planetary exploration, the treasures\r\nof the Saturn system far exceeded all expectations. We learned more\r\nabout Saturn in one week than in all of recorded history, thanks to one\r\ntrusty robot no larger than a compact car and to thousands of diligent\r\nand imaginative people.\r\n\r\nBoth spacecraft carry an assortment of optical, radiometric, and fields\r\nand particles sensing instruments. Taken together, their data present a\r\ncomprehensive picture of a planetary system—and clues to what is\r\nhappening, what has happened, and what may happen in our universe.\r\n\r\nThis publication presents the preliminary photographic results of\r\nVoyager 1’s encounter with Saturn and its major satellites. Voyager 1\r\ntransmitted over 17,500 images in its four months of close observations\r\nof the system. Many of these images have been combined to produce\r\nmosaics and color pictures. Hundreds have yet to be closely examined.\r\n\r\nThe second Voyager spacecraft will begin its close Saturn observations\r\nin early June 1981 and make its closest approach to the planet’s\r\nnorthern hemisphere on August 25. Then, due to its launch during a\r\nperiod of rare planetary alignment occurring only once every 175 years,\r\nVoyager 2 will be able to continue on to a rendezvous with the seventh\r\nplanet, Uranus, in January 1986, and perhaps even the eighth planet,\r\nNeptune, in August 1989.\r\n\r\nVoyager 1’s primary mission is complete. But its usefulness is far from\r\nover. As we go about our daily business, Voyager 1 is searching for\r\nanother frontier—the edge of our solar system. In 7 to 15 years, the\r\nspacecraft will cross the heliopause—the farthest reaches of our Sun’s\r\nmagnetic field influence. Then, high above our ecliptic plane, Voyager 1\r\nwill continue its flight toward the star Alpha Ophiuchus. Eventually,\r\nVoyager 1 will be too distant to communicate with Earth and will\r\nsilently drift in space forever.\r\n\r\n    Andrew J.

Like Jupiter, it is a giant sphere of gas—mostly\r\n    hydrogen and helium—with a possible core of rocky material. Various\r\n    features in Saturn’s cloudtops are visible in the accompanying\r\n    color-enhanced image of the planet’s northern hemisphere:\r\n    small-scale convective cloud features (similar to, but much larger\r\n    than, thunderstorms in Earth’s atmosphere) are visible in the brown\r\n    belt; an isolated convective cloud with a dark ring is visible in\r\n    the light brown zone; and a longitudinal wave is visible in the\r\n    light blue region.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 9/17/80    76 million km (47 million mi)\r\n\r\n    As Voyager 1 approached Saturn, a series of dark and light cloud\r\n    bands (belts and zones) became apparent in the planet’s northern\r\n    hemisphere through a high altitude atmospheric haze. The planet’s\r\n    shadow obscures the rings behind and immediately to the east of the\r\n    disk. In addition, the shadow of the rings on the planet’s disk can\r\n    be seen just north of the rings themselves as they cross in front of\r\n    the planet. Six of Saturn’s 15 known satellites are visible.\r\n    Saturn’s largest moon, Titan (considerably larger than Earth’s\r\n    moon), is clearly visible in the upper left corner. The smaller\r\n    satellites Dione, Tethys, and Rhea are shown in the lower left\r\n    corner (upper, middle, and lower, respectively). Two of the\r\n    innermost moons, Mimas and Enceladus, appear to the right of the\r\n    planet (Mimas is the one closer to the planet). These six moons\r\n    orbit Saturn in the equatorial plane and appear in their present\r\n    positions because Voyager is above that plane.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 10/18/80    34 million km (21 million mi)\r\n\r\n    The North Temperate Belt is visible as the violet-colored belt in\r\n    this false-color photograph. In this image, features which are\r\n    especially bright in ultraviolet light appear as turquoise and\r\n    violet, while ultraviolet-dark areas appear orange. Notice in\r\n    particular the three spots (two bright orange and one pale violet)\r\n    at mid-northern latitudes. The bright spots are similar to those\r\n    shown at much higher resolution in later images. The distinct color\r\n    difference between the North Equatorial Belt and Saturn’s other\r\n    belts and zones may be due to a thick haze layer covering the\r\n    northern portion of the belt. It is not yet understood why the\r\n    southern hemisphere of the planet (below the rings) appears bluer\r\n    than the northern hemisphere. Color spots in the rings are artifacts\r\n    of image processing.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 10/30/80    18 million km (11 million mi)\r\n\r\n    Saturn’s soft, velvety appearance and previously unseen detail in\r\n    its mysterious rings became visible as Voyager 1 approached the\r\n    planet. For example, a gap in the dark C-Ring is now visible, and\r\n    material can be seen within the relatively wide Cassini Division\r\n    (long believed to be empty), which separates the B-Ring (middle)\r\n    from the A-Ring (outer). The Encke Division appears near the outer\r\n    edge of the A-Ring. Detail can be seen within the shadow cast by the\r\n    rings upon the planet: the broad, dark band near the equator is the\r\n    shadow of the B-Ring; the thinner, brighter line just to the south\r\n    is the shadow of the less dense A-Ring. Three of Saturn’s moons,\r\n    Tethys (outer left), Enceladus (inner left), and Mimas (right) are\r\n    also visible in this computer mosaic of Voyager 1 images.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/6/80    8.5 million km (5.3 million mi)\r\n\r\n    An unusual red oval cloud feature, similar to (but smaller than)\r\n    Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, was discovered in the southern hemisphere\r\n    of Saturn. The oval, 6000 kilometers (4000 miles) in length, is\r\n    located at 55 degrees south latitude. The difference in color\r\n    between the red oval and the surrounding bluish clouds in these two\r\n    false-color images indicates that material within the oval contains\r\n    a substance that absorbs more blue and violet light than the bluish\r\n    clouds. Voyager scientists first observed the oval in August 1980,\r\n    and the feature has retained its appearance since its discovery.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/6/80    8 million km (5 million mi)\r\n\r\n    In this photograph, the shadow of the satellite Dione is seen as a\r\n    dark circle on the face of the planet.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/10/80    3.5 million km (2.2 million mi)\r\n\r\n    A ribbon-like wave structure and small convective features marking a\r\n    westward jet stream above the wave are visible in this photograph of\r\n    Saturn’s cloudtops. The view, extending from 40 degrees to 60\r\n    degrees north latitude, shows features 65 kilometers (40 miles) in\r\n    diameter. Measurements in images such as this one indicate that\r\n    Saturn has fewer east-to-west wind currents than does Jupiter.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/12/80    442,000 km (265,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Numerous small cloud features were photographed as Voyager 1 passed\r\n    above Saturn’s southern hemisphere. At these polar latitudes, the\r\n    large-scale light and dark bands break down into small-scale\r\n    features, seen here as waves and eddies.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/7/80    7.5 million km (4.6 million mi)\r\n\r\n    Two brown ovals, approximately 10,000 kilometers (6000 miles)\r\n    across, were discovered in Saturn’s northern hemisphere, at about 40\r\n    degrees and 60 degrees latitude. The polar oval (upper left) has a\r\n    structure similar to Saturn’s red oval located in the southern polar\r\n    latitudes. Detail within the ovals is not visible at this\r\n    resolution, so it is not yet known if they are rotating features\r\n    similar to the many spots in Jupiter’s atmosphere.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               The Rings\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/12/80    717,000 km (444,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    The rings of Saturn have amazed and intrigued astronomers for over\r\n    300 years. Now that we have seen them up close, they are even more\r\n    astonishing. Although they stretch over 65,000 kilometers (40,000\r\n    miles), they may be only a few kilometers thick. The ring\r\n    particles—from a few microns to a meter (three feet) in size—have\r\n    been described as icy snowballs or ice-covered rock. Voyager\r\n    scientists continue to pore over their data, searching for answers\r\n    to the puzzles of the rings. The rings were named in order of their\r\n    discovery, so the labels do not indicate their relative positions.\r\n    From the planet outward, they are known as D, C, B, A, F, and E.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 10/25/80    24 million km (15 million mi)\r\n\r\n    Extraordinarily complex structure is seen across the entire span of\r\n    Saturn’s ring system. The sequence (taken approximately every 15\r\n    minutes as Voyager 1 approached Saturn) proceeds from top to bottom\r\n    in each column and shows radial “spokes” rotating within the B-Ring.\r\n    The spokes may be caused by a combination of magnetic and\r\n    electrostatic forces.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/6/80    8 million km (5 million mi)\r\n\r\n    Over 95 individual concentric features can he counted; the final\r\n    count in higher resolution images may be anywhere from 500 to 1000\r\n    separate rings. A few of the ringlets shown in this\r\n    computer-assembled mosaic are not concentric circles but are instead\r\n    elliptical. Ring particles are probably ice or ice covered rock.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The classic features of the rings are illustrated in\r\n    the diagram.]\r\n\r\n  D-RING\r\n  C-RING\r\n  B-RING\r\n  “SPOKE”\r\n  CASSINI DIVISION\r\n  ENCKE DIVISION\r\n  A-RING\r\n  F-RING\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/8/80    6 million km (3.7 million mi)\r\n\r\n    The Cassini Division is filled with numerous ringlets. Discovered by\r\n    Cassini in 1675, this area between the A- and B-Rings had long been\r\n    thought devoid of material. The Voyager observation of well-defined\r\n    rings within the Cassini Division was an unexpected discovery.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/12/80    740,000 km (460,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Saturn’s ring system, viewed from below, appears dramatically\r\n    different from its appearance on the sunlit side. This\r\n    computer-processed image shows the F-Ring circling outside the\r\n    A-Ring, the A-Ring with its Encke Division, the multiple ringlets in\r\n    the Cassini Division, and the optically thick B-Ring, seen here in\r\n    magenta hues (the coloration is an artifact of processing and is not\r\n    real). The B-Ring appears dark from below the ring plane because it\r\n    is dense enough to reflect most of the sunlight, causing it to\r\n    appear very bright when seen from the sunward side. The opaline\r\n    brightness of the Cassini Division here indicates a great deal of\r\n    sunlight being scattered through this region. The Encke Division may\r\n    really be empty, since it appears dark from both above and below.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/12/80    720,000 km (450,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Outbound and above the ring plane, Voyager 1 gave us this view of\r\n    Saturn’s rings eight hours after its closest approach to the planet.\r\n    The unique lighting accentuates the many hundreds of bright and dark\r\n    ringlets comprising the ring system. The C-Ring (dark gray area)\r\n    seems to blend into the brighter B-Ring as the concentric features\r\n    radiate out from the planet. The dark spoke-like features seen in\r\n    images taken during the approach to Saturn now appear as bright\r\n    streaks, indicating that they may be composed of small particles.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/12/80    750,000 km (470,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Two narrow, braided rings in the F-Ring are evident in this view, as\r\n    well as a broader, very diffuse component about 35 kilometers (20\r\n    miles) across. A totally unexpected discovery, the braided rings\r\n    trace distinctly separate orbits intertwining each other. The\r\n    “knots” may be local clumps of ring material or tiny moons. It is\r\n    difficult to explain this complicated structure using only the\r\n    gravitational forces known to be affecting the particles of this\r\n    ring. It is possible that additional, electrostatic forces may also\r\n    influence these particles.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/8/80    7 million km (4.3 million mi)\r\n\r\n    Brightness variations in the F-Ring may be due to clumping in the\r\n    ring material. The features are seen at the top and again near the\r\n    left edge of the ring in this image. The “gap” in the ring (left\r\n    center) is not real but is the location of a reseau mark on the\r\n    camera’s vidicon tube. These bright features in the F-Ring appear to\r\n    move at the orbital rate of the ring particles and may be larger\r\n    bodies or thicknesses in the rings. Saturn’s thirteenth and\r\n    fourteenth satellites, which orbit on either side of the F-Ring, may\r\n    act like “sheepdogs,” herding the F-Ring particles between them.\r\n    Less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) wide, the F-Ring is located\r\n    outside of the A-Ring. Satellite 14, discovered by Voyager 1, is\r\n    seen just inside the F-Ring.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Satellites\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: In only twelve hours, Saturn’s satellites grew from\r\n    names in ancient mythology into dazzling worlds with personae of\r\n    their own. As Voyager 1 sailed through the Saturn system, it\r\n    returned photographs of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and\r\n    Rhea—all part of a class of intermediate-sized icy bodies heretofore\r\n    unstudied by planetary spacecraft. All but Enceladus show heavily\r\n    cratered surfaces, evidence of aeons of meteorite bombardment.\r\n    Enceladus hints at internal processes, as yet unidentified, which\r\n    may have erased from its surface the evidence of early\r\n    bombardment—but we must await Voyager 2’s arrival next August to\r\n    better understand this body.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/9/80    4.5 million km (2.8 million mi)\r\n\r\n    The surface of giant Titan, now dethroned from its seat as the solar\r\n    system’s largest satellite (Jupiter’s Ganymede is larger), remains\r\n    an enigma, shrouded beneath thick layers of haze.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/12/80    22,000 km (14,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Tiny moons—three new ones and three confirmed from previous\r\n    sightings—may tell us much about ring dynamics since gravitational\r\n    forces from satellites probably influence the ring structure. Two of\r\n    these tiny moons are on the verge of collision in the same orbit,\r\n    while several others appear to bound the A- and F-Rings. Iapetus,\r\n    whose two hemispheres differ dramatically in brightness, was\r\n    photographed in its orbit, almost 3.6 million kilometers (2.2\r\n    million miles) from the planet.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/12/80    425,000 km (264,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Mimas, Saturn’s innermost large satellite, has an impact crater\r\n    covering more than one quarter the diameter of the entire moon.\r\n    Nowhere else in the solar system has such a disproportionately large\r\n    feature been seen. In fact, it is believed that any impact larger\r\n    than this would probably have shattered Mimas into two or more\r\n    fragments. The crater has a raised rim and central peak, typical of\r\n    large impact structures on terrestrial planets. Additional smaller\r\n    craters, 15 to 45 kilometers (10 to 30 miles) in diameter, can be\r\n    seen scattered across the surface, particularly along the\r\n    terminator. Mimas is one of the small, low density Saturnian\r\n    satellites implying that it is composed primarily of ice.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 11/12/80    130,000 km (80,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Mimas’ other side shows a uniformly and heavily cratered surface—a\r\n    record of the bombardment that occurred throughout the solar system\r\n    in its early history 4.5 billion years ago.

The\r\ngravity-assist technique uses one planet’s gravity field and motion\r\nthrough space to alter the spacecraft’s flight path and propel it\r\noutward toward the next planet. Voyager 1’s trajectory, which was\r\nselected to best view Titan, has now propelled the spacecraft out of the\r\necliptic plane, while Voyager 2’s path will remain in this plane to\r\nprovide future encounters with Uranus and possibly with Neptune.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSION OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe Voyager Project was approved in June 1972 and had as its mission\r\nobjectives:\r\n\r\n  ★ Exploration of the Jupiter and Saturn planetary systems, including\r\n          their atmospheres, rings, satellites, and magnetospheres\r\n  ★ Comparative analyses of the two systems\r\n  ★ Investigation of the interplanetary medium between Earth and Saturn\r\n\r\nA fourth objective, added in 1976, was to preserve the possibility of\r\nextending the mission to include an investigation of the planet Uranus\r\nand the interstellar medium.\r\n\r\nWith the completion of Voyager 1’s Saturn flyby, it is now clear that\r\nthese objectives will be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPACECRAFT CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\nTwo identical spacecraft were developed for the 1977 launch opportunity.\r\nThese marvelous machines were cleverly designed to survive the rigors of\r\nlong voyages in outer space and to deliver high-quality scientific\r\ninformation required for detailed understanding of planetary systems.\r\nThe spacecraft are both complex—automatically responding to their\r\nEarth-bound monitors that remotely control them via radio commands—and\r\nhighly autonomous—capable of caring for themselves in many areas through\r\na system of sensors, computers, and spare equipment. Each spacecraft\r\nfunctions on about 400 watts of electrical power which is provided by\r\nnuclear generators. Broadcasts of data across a billion miles to Earth\r\nare accomplished with a spacecraft transmitter power of only about 25\r\nwatts, the amount of energy required by a small household light bulb.\r\n\r\nVoyager’s scientific payload was carefully chosen to observe Saturn over\r\na wide range of wave-lengths and to measure magnetic fields, charged\r\nparticles, and plasma waves.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURN ENCOUNTER\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Voyager 1 approached within 124,000 kilometers\r\n    (77,000 miles) of Saturn’s cloudtops.

Even at\r\nthis great distance, Voyager’s images were better than any from\r\nEarth-based telescopes. During the long encounter period, which extended\r\nthrough December 19, 1980, continuous observations of Saturn’s realm\r\nwere carried out by Voyager’s instruments. Voyager 1’s flight path\r\nthrough the Saturn system demanded navigation of the highest precision\r\nto meet three critical targets: (1) a close 4000-kilometer (2300-mile)\r\nflyby and occultation at Titan, (2) a precise, three-minute time period\r\nwhen the spacecraft was emerging from occultation at the same time Earth\r\nwas in a position to receive the spacecraft signals passing through the\r\ngap between Saturn and its rings, and (3) a flight path through the\r\nE-Ring at Dione’s orbit to assure safe passage through a zone clear of\r\npotentially dangerous material. To assure these targets were achieved,\r\nsmall trajectory trim maneuvers were executed on October 11, 1980, and\r\nagain on November 6, 1980, as Voyager 1 sped toward Saturn.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Voyager spacecraft and scientific instruments._]\r\n\r\n  HIGH-GAIN ANTENNA (3.7-meter diameter)\r\n  LOW-ENERGY CHARGED PARTICLE\r\n  COSMIC RAY\r\n  PLASMA\r\n  IMAGING\r\n  ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROMETER\r\n  INFRARED INTERFEROMETER SPECTROMETER\r\n  PHOTOPOLARIMETER\r\n  OPTICAL CALIBRATION TARGET\r\n  PLANETARY RADIO ASTRONOMY AND PLASMA WAVE ANTENNA (2)\r\n  RADIOISOTOPE THERMOELECTRIC GENERATOR (3)\r\n  MAGNETOMETER BOOM\r\n\r\nBy October 24, 1980, when Voyager 1 was about 30 million kilometers (19\r\nmillion miles) from Saturn, the spacecraft’s narrow-angle camera could\r\nno longer capture the planet in a single picture. Thus, a period of\r\nmultiple images or mosaics began. By November 2, 1980, even four-picture\r\nmosaics could no longer cover the rapidly growing scene. Voyager 1’s\r\npace of operations reached an exciting peak during the near-encounter\r\nphase from November 11 through November 13, 1980. While still about 1.6\r\nmillion kilometers (1 million miles) from closest approach to Saturn,\r\nVoyager 1 encountered Titan on November 11, 1980, and then dipped below\r\nthe ring plane as it accelerated rapidly toward Saturn. On November 12,\r\n1980, Voyager 1 came within 124,000 kilometers (77,000 miles) of the\r\ncloudtops of Saturn’s southern hemisphere, where Saturn’s gravity\r\naltered the spacecraft’s course, hurtling the spacecraft upward past the\r\nring plane. Close observation of Saturn’s other major satellites and its\r\nrings were made during this passage.\r\n\r\nFrom Earth to Saturn, Voyager 1 has traveled in the ecliptic plane, the\r\nplane in which the major planets orbit. Now, having completed its final\r\nplanetary flyby, Voyager 1 is rising above this plane on a trajectory\r\nthat will eventually carry it above and out of the solar system,\r\nprobably before the end of this century. As it proceeds, the spacecraft\r\nwill return information about the solar wind and magnetic fields in the\r\nfar, unexplored reaches of our solar system and will observe cosmic rays\r\nemitted from the distant stars among which Voyager will ultimately\r\ncruise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Scientific Highlights\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the most important information gathered by Voyager 1 on the\r\nSaturn system is presented pictorially in this publication and is\r\nsupplemented here with brief summaries of the major discoveries,\r\nobservations, and theories.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURN\r\n\r\nSaturn’s atmosphere appears similar to Jupiter’s, with alternating dark\r\nbelts and bright zones, circulating storm regions, and other dark and\r\nlight cloud markings. Saturn’s belt and zone system extends to higher\r\nlatitudes than those on Jupiter, and all of the features are muted by a\r\nthick atmospheric haze, perhaps 70 kilometers (40 miles) deep.\r\n\r\nWind speeds up to 1500 kilometers per hour (900 miles per hour) occur at\r\nthe equator—four to five times faster than any Jovian winds.\r\nTemperatures near the cloudtops range from 86 to 92 kelvins (-305° to\r\n-294° Fahrenheit)—nearly 60 degrees colder than at Jupiter. Saturn still\r\nradiates about 2.8 times as much heat as it receives from the Sun. The\r\ncoolest temperatures are found at the center of the equatorial zone.\r\n\r\nAuroral emissions have been seen near Saturn’s poles, and auroral-type\r\nemissions have been seen in ultraviolet light near the illuminated limb\r\nof the planet.\r\n\r\nLightning bolts have not been seen on Saturn, but radio emissions\r\ntypical of lightning discharges have been recorded. The source of these\r\ndischarges is believed to be the rings rather than Saturn’s atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nRINGS\r\n\r\nHundreds of tiny ringlets—a few of them elliptical rather than\r\ncircular—comprise the classic A-, B-, and C-Rings, once thought to be\r\nuniform disks of material. The F-Ring, which was first sighted by\r\nPioneer 11 in 1979, was observed to be three separate, intertwined\r\nringlets.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a D-Ring between the C-Ring and the planet has been\r\nconfirmed by observations during Voyager 1’s passage through Saturn’s\r\nshadow. The tenuous E-Ring, previously observed from Earth only when\r\nSaturn’s rings could be viewed edge-on (every 15 years), has also been\r\nobserved during shadow passage. At least one other ring has been found\r\nbetween the E- and F-Rings in Voyager images.\r\n\r\nLong, radial, spoke-like features in the B-Ring were dark when viewed\r\nupon approach and bright when observed after encounter when the\r\nspacecraft looked back toward the planet and the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SATELLITES\r\n\r\nVoyager 1 photographed six tiny moons, some that had never been seen\r\nbefore. Satellites 10 and 11, dubbed the “co-orbitals,” share an orbit\r\n91,000 kilometers (57,000 miles) above Saturn’s cloudtops. The leading\r\nsatellite has a diameter of about 160 kilometers (100 miles), while the\r\ntrailing satellite has an irregular shape, approximately 105 by 65\r\nkilometers (65 by 40 miles).\r\n\r\nLittle is known about satellites 12, 13, 14, and 15 aside from their\r\norbits and periods. Satellite 12 orbits at the same distance from Saturn\r\nas Dione, at a point about 60 degrees ahead of Dione. Satellites 13 and\r\n14, outside and inside the F-Ring (respectively), appear to “herd” this\r\nthin ring between them. Satellite 15 appears to limit the outer edge of\r\nthe A-Ring in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nINNER SATELLITES\r\n\r\nMimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea represent a body size not\r\npreviously explored by spacecraft. They are larger than Jupiter’s\r\nAmalthea and Mars’ Phobos and Deimos, yet smaller than Mercury, our\r\nMoon, or Jupiter’s large satellites. Their diameters range from 390\r\nkilometers (240 miles) for Mimas to 1530 kilometers (950 miles) for\r\nRhea, and they are probably composed primarily of water ice.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Enceladus, all of these moons have heavily\r\ncratered surfaces, looking much like the Moon and Mercury. Mimas\r\ndisplays an impact crater whose diameter is one-fourth that of the\r\nsatellite—such an impact must have nearly shattered the icy satellite.\r\nTethys has a valley 70 kilometers (40 miles) wide that stretches 800\r\nkilometers (500 miles) across the satellite, an apparent crustal\r\nfracture resulting from seismic activity. Several sinuous valleys, some\r\nof which appear to branch, are visible on Dione’s surface. Both Dione\r\nand Rhea have bright, wispy streaks on their already highly reflective\r\nsurfaces, perhaps caused by ice thrown out of craters by meteorite\r\nimpacts.\r\n\r\nOf the five inner moons, Enceladus appears the smoothest, but we will\r\nhave to wait for Voyager 2 to photograph the satellite at greater\r\nresolution in 1981. Since the maximum intensity of the E-Ring occurs\r\nnear Enceladus’ orbit, Enceladus may be a source of E-Ring particles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITAN\r\n\r\nTitan is now known to be smaller than Jupiter’s Ganymede. Its diameter\r\nis less than 5120 kilometers (3180 miles), which implies a density twice\r\nthat of water ice. A dense, hazy atmosphere at least 400 kilometers (250\r\nmiles) thick obscures the surface. Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a\r\nnitrogen-rich atmosphere (as does Earth), but with concentrations of\r\nhydrocarbons such as methane (natural gas), ethane, acetylene, ethylene,\r\nand deadly hydrogen cyanide. The haze layers merge into a darkened hood\r\nover the north pole. At the poles, liquid nitrogen lakes may form. The\r\nsurface temperature is probably near 100 kelvins (-280° Fahrenheit),\r\nonly slightly warmer than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.\r\n\r\nTitan has no appreciable magnetic field and therefore possesses no large\r\nliquid conducting core. It does, however, supply a small amount of\r\ncharged particles to Saturn’s magnetosphere.\r\n\r\nThe southern hemisphere is somewhat brighter than the northern, perhaps\r\nas a result of seasonal effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTER SATELLITES\r\n\r\nOf the three known outer satellites, Voyager 1 studied from a distance\r\nonly Hyperion and Iapetus. Tiny Phoebe, in its retrograde (clockwise)\r\norbit, will be studied by Voyager 2 in the summer of 1981. Hyperion and\r\nIapetus are most likely composed of water ice, although their masses and\r\ndensities are uncertain. Iapetus has one bright and one dark hemisphere.\r\nThe dark side, which faces forward as Iapetus circles Saturn, reflects\r\nabout one-fifth as much light as the trailing, bright side.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETOSPHERE\r\n\r\nAlthough it is only about one-third the size of Jupiter’s magnetosphere,\r\nSaturn’s magnetosphere is still an enormous structure, extending nearly\r\ntwo million kilometers from the planet toward the Sun. The size of the\r\nmagnetosphere fluctuates rhythmically as the flow of charged particles\r\nin the solar wind increases or decreases in intensity. The magnetosphere\r\ncan be pushed inside Titan’s orbit, so that at times the satellite finds\r\nitself outside of the magnetosphere altogether.\r\n\r\nCharged particles in the planet’s magnetosphere are dragged along by the\r\nmagnetic field, circling the planet at Saturn’s rotation rate of 10\r\nhours, 39 minutes. These charged particles whiz by Titan at a dizzying\r\nrate of more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) per second. Titan leaves a\r\nmotorboat-like wake in its orbital path.\r\n\r\nExtending from the orbit of Titan inward to the orbit of Rhea, an\r\nenormous cloud of uncharged hydrogen atoms forms a doughnut-shaped torus\r\nof ultraviolet-emitting particles. Because of their neutrality, these\r\natoms are not towed around by Saturn’s magnetic field.\r\n\r\nClose to the planet, Saturn’s rings act as an effective shield or\r\nabsorber of charged particles. The rings themselves are apparently\r\nsubstantially affected in this process, however, as evidenced by their\r\n“spokes” of fine particles and the lightning-like electrical discharges\r\nattributed to the rings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Scientific Investigations\r\n\r\n\r\n  INVESTIGATION         SATURN ENCOUNTER OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n  Imaging science       Planetary meteorology; satellite geology;\r\n                        ring structure and dynamics\r\n  Infrared              Atmospheric composition, thermal structure\r\n  interferometry        and dynamics; satellite surface composition\r\n                        and thermal properties; ring composition\r\n  Radio science         Atmospheric and ionospheric structure,\r\n                        constituents, and dynamics at Saturn and\r\n                        Titan; ring particle size\r\n  Ultraviolet           Upper atmospheric composition and structure;\r\n  spectroscopy          auroral processes; distribution of ions and\r\n                        neutral atoms in the Saturn system\r\n  Magnetic fields       Planetary magnetic field; magnetospheric\r\n                        structure\r\n  Plasma particles      Magnetospheric ion and electron\r\n                        distribution; solar wind interaction with\r\n                        Saturn; ions from satellites\r\n  Plasma waves          Plasma electron densities; wave-particle\r\n                        interactions; low-frequency wave emissions\r\n  Planetary radio       Polarization and spectra of radio-frequency\r\n  astronomy             emissions; plasma densities\r\n  Low-energy charged    Distribution, composition, and flow of\r\n  particles             energetic ions and electrons;\r\n                        satellite-energetic particle interactions\r\n  Cosmic ray particles  Distribution, composition, and flow of\r\n                        high-energy trapped nuclei; energetic\r\n                        electron spectra\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Notre voyageur connaissait merveilleusement les lois de la\r\ngravitation, et toutes les forces attractives et répulsives.
