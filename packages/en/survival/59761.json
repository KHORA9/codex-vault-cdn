Wirth, _Director_\r\n\r\n  _Three gigantic natural bridges carved out of sandstone and located in\r\n  a region of superb scenery_\r\n\r\nSan Juan County, in the southeastern corner of Utah, is a land of\r\nbrilliantly colored cliffs, tortuous box canyons, pinnacles, and arches.\r\nNear the center of this scenic and geologic potpourri is Natural Bridges\r\nNational Monument.\r\n\r\nWithin the monument are three huge natural bridges. While they are\r\nexceeded in size by the great Rainbow Bridge, which lies about 60 miles\r\nto the southwest in Rainbow Bridge National Monument, they rank with the\r\nlargest known natural bridges.\r\n\r\nOne of these bridges--Owachomo--is directly across the 600-foot-deep\r\nArmstrong Canyon and spans the mouth of a short tributary canyon. The\r\nroad from Blanding, Utah, ends at the rim of the Armstrong Canyon. To\r\nvisit the other bridges in the monument, one must walk. The trail is\r\nunimproved, and sometimes rough, but the 6-mile hike is rewarded by\r\nviews of the magnificent canyons, the bridges, and ancient Indian ruins.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters area of the monument overlooks the Owachomo Bridge, and\r\na 300-yard trail drops to the bottom of Armstrong Canyon to a point\r\nwhere one can walk under the bridge. Continuing on this trail, Sipapu\r\nBridge may be reached by a 3-mile walk; however, if you wish to see all\r\nthree bridges with the least walking, drive your car from headquarters,\r\n4½ miles, to the Kachina Bridge parking area and from there it is\r\nthree-quarters of a mile by a ladder trail to Kachina Bridge and 2 miles\r\nfrom Kachina to Sipapu Bridge, up White Canyon. No trail is maintained\r\nbetween Kachina Bridge and Owachomo Bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      The Bridges and Their Names\r\n\r\nThe bridges were first seen by white man in 1883 when Cass Hite, a\r\nprospector, visited the region. National publicity was given to the area\r\nin 1904 when an illustrated article appeared in the National Geographic\r\nMagazine. In 1908 the area was proclaimed Natural Bridges National\r\nMonument by President Theodore Roosevelt. This action was the result of\r\npleas of Utah citizens and of a Government surveyor that the bridges be\r\nprotected by the Federal Government.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Owachomo is in view at the end of the road._]\r\n\r\nEarly explorers had named the bridges for members of their parties or\r\nfor relatives. When the monument was established, an effort was made to\r\nfind Indian names which would fit the bridges. Paiute Indians, who still\r\nlive in the country, had no names for the individual bridges. At the\r\ntime they were questioned they professed to know only a single term\r\nwhich they applied to all bridges, natural or otherwise. This was\r\n\"Ma-Vah-Talk-Tump,\" or \"Under the Horse's Belly.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Kachina Bridge--the youngest of the three._]\r\n\r\nAt that time it was generally thought that the prehistoric people who\r\nhad lived in the ruins of southern Utah were direct ancestors of the\r\nHopi Indians, so it was natural, when no Paiute names were forthcoming,\r\nthat Hopi names were applied to the bridges. They are:\r\n\r\n_Owachomo_ (Rock Mound)--So named because of a large, rounded block of\r\nrock on the mesa near one end of the bridge. Also formerly known as the\r\nEdwin Bridge.\r\n\r\n_Kachina_--On one of the abutments of this bridge are numerous\r\nprehistoric pictographs, some of which resemble Hopi masked dancers, or\r\nkachinas. The former name for this bridge was Caroline.\r\n\r\n_Sipapu_--The graceful arch of this bridge suggested to its namers the\r\nsipapu (place of emergence), a hole through which the Hopi believe their\r\nancestors emerged from a lower, dark world into the present, sunlit one.\r\nThis was also known as the Augusta Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the bridges are:\r\n\r\n  Bridge    Height (feet)  Span (feet)  Width (feet)   Thickness (feet)\r\n  Owachomo            106          180            27                  9\r\n  Kachina             210          206            44                 93\r\n  Sipapu              220          268            31                 53\r\n\r\n\r\n                      How Natural Bridges Are Made\r\n\r\nTo make a natural bridge Mother Nature must have several ingredients: a\r\nproper stone that will shape well (a cross-bedded sandstone is best), a\r\nslowly rising landscape, and a desert-type stream that occasionally will\r\nscour its bed with a tremendous head of water and sand. All these were\r\npresent in southern Utah.\r\n\r\nThe stone of the Natural Bridges area is a cross-bedded grey sandstone,\r\nknown as the Cedar Mesa sandstone. It is of Permian age and similar in\r\nappearance and structure to the more recent Navajo sandstone in which so\r\nmany caves and arches have been formed.\r\n\r\nWhen the land began to rise slowly from its ancient sea bed, two small\r\nstreams formed on the western slopes of the Elk Ridge. The streams are\r\nknown today as White River and Armstrong Creek, its tributary. They made\r\nmeandering channels across the flat land and gradually entrenched\r\nthemselves into tortuous canyons. As the land continued to rise, the\r\nstreams cut ever deeper canyons.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose, or the driving force, of a stream is to make the\r\nshortest distance between two points, that is, a straight line. Every\r\ncreek and river attempts to make a straight channel with an even grade\r\nfrom its source to its mouth. Hills, ridges, blocks of rock, or any\r\nother obstacles which a stream must bypass are gradually worn away as\r\nthe stream makes a channel more to its choice.\r\n\r\nThe tortuous streams in their deep rock channels were constantly trying\r\nto straighten their courses. During floods the silt-laden waters were\r\nthrown with great force against the walls of the meanders. In several\r\nplaces the fins of rock around which the windings of the streams passed\r\nwere so thin that during the course of many centuries of buffeting the\r\nrock gradually wore away and a hole was bored through the fin. The\r\nwaters poured through the gap and the bridge was born. After the initial\r\nbreach was made, the stream continued to enlarge the opening and to cut\r\nits channel still deeper. Eventually, the old meander was left high and\r\ndry as a \"fossil\" stream bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Ages of the Bridges\r\n\r\nSeveral phases of bridge-making may be seen at Natural Bridges National\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nKachina Bridge is a new bridge. It is huge and bulky, and has a\r\ncomparatively small opening. White River is still actively enlarging the\r\nopening beneath the span.\r\n\r\nSipapu Bridge is mature. It is a graceful, symmetrical span, and its\r\nabutments now lie far enough from the stream bed that the river has\r\nlittle or no cutting action on the rock.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Sipapu Bridge, looking up White Canyon._]\r\n\r\nOwachomo Bridge is in its old age. It suffers no erosion from the\r\nstream; only the slight erosion from rains, frost action, or wind-blown\r\nsands now attack its surface. The life expectancy of Owachomo is short\r\ncompared with that of the other two; it may span the canyon for\r\ncenturies yet, or the crack which will ultimately cause its collapse may\r\nalready have started.\r\n\r\nThe fate of all the bridges may be seen a short distance up White Canyon\r\nfrom Sipapu Bridge where faint scars and damaged abutments on the canyon\r\nwalls indicate the point where a fourth bridge once spanned the canyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Comparison With Other Types of Natural Bridges\r\n\r\nMost of the natural bridges of the United States are in the Four Corners\r\nregion of the Southwest where favorable materials and conditions for\r\nbridge-making are to be found. There are two other types of bridges\r\nwhich are entirely dissimilar. Tonto Natural Bridge, in central Arizona,\r\nis a \"built-up\" bridge created by travertine deposited by springs.\r\nNatural Bridge, in Virginia--another well-known bridge--apparently was\r\nformed when most of the roof of a cavern collapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Wildlife\r\n\r\nDeer are numerous in the pinyon and juniper forest which surrounds the\r\nmonument, and mountain sheep, which spend their summers on the Elk\r\nRidge, winter in the canyons. Smaller mammals are numerous, as are the\r\ncoyotes and wildcats. An occasional lion works through the monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Archeology\r\n\r\nThis section of Utah supported an Indian population from about 2,000\r\nyears ago until about A. D. 1300. Thousands of ruins stud the mesas and\r\ncanyons of the district. Comparatively few sites lie within the\r\nmonument, however, for both White and Armstrong Canyons are too narrow\r\nto have furnished enough farming land for more than a few families.\r\n\r\nVisitors who hike around the trail to the bridges may see one cliff\r\ndwelling of about 20 rooms and several small rooms (apparently\r\ngranaries) which were built on ledges high on the cliffs. An outstanding\r\nfeature of the cliff dwelling is a kiva, or ceremonial room, with the\r\noriginal roof and ladder intact. The people who lived here during\r\nprehistoric times were closely related to those who lived on the Mesa\r\nVerde in southwestern Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Caution\r\n\r\nThe two approach roads serving Natural Bridges National Monument from\r\nBlanding, Utah, are unsurfaced dirt roads with steep grades. During\r\nheavy rain storms they become either difficult or impassable to travel.\r\nThe upper road over Bear's Ears Pass (elevation 9,000 feet) is usually\r\nblocked by snow and impassable from late September until late May. The\r\nlower road, via Comb Wash, stays below 7,000 feet and is usually open\r\nmost of the year.\r\n\r\nThere are no accommodations for travelers beyond Blanding. Visitors\r\nshould make certain that they have ample food before they leave\r\nBlanding. There is camping space at the monument for those who have\r\nbedding and cooking equipment. A National Park Service ranger is\r\nstationed at the monument only during the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Administration\r\n\r\nNatural Bridges National Monument, with an area of 2,649.70 acres, is\r\nadministered by the National Park Service, United States Department of\r\nthe Interior.
