The use of\r\ntracks to bring goods to be placed on vessels as near as possible to the\r\nshipping point, the substitution of oblique moles for perpendicular ones\r\nin large docks, the creation of a hydraulic method of loading and\r\nunloading through movable cranes (which will perhaps in a near future cede\r\nto an electrical one), constitute the means most used for expediting\r\ntransshipments and reducing the expense of them to a minimum. But, at the\r\nsame time that the facilities for all kinds for handling packages have\r\nbeen increased, it has also become necessary to greatly increase the power\r\nof the machines applied to them. The construction of large packets now\r\nrequires the putting in place of boilers of great weight, and the adoption\r\nof the huge pieces that compose the artillery of ironclads necessitates\r\nthe use of force that has been unknown up to recent times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--DIAGRAM OF SHEARS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TON SHEARS OF THE PORT OF\r\nMARSEILLES.]\r\n\r\nAt present, then, we could no longer be content with manual power, acting\r\nupon windlasses or capstans, for lifting and shifting. It has become\r\nnecessary to apply steam or hydraulic motors to these operations. Of\r\nthese, the latter are the most used, on account of their easy operation\r\nand their submitting to the greatest stresses with a very satisfactory\r\nproportionality of the expenditure of motive power. One of the most\r\nremarkable of such apparatus is the one that the Compagnie de Fives-Lille\r\nhas recently set up on one of the moles of the national dock at\r\nMarseilles, for the service of the chamber of commerce, and this merits a\r\ndescription so much the more in that it is an important improvement upon\r\nthe analogous apparatus now in use in other ports.\r\n\r\nAccording to the conditions of the programme, powers of 25, 75, and 120\r\ntons had to be obtained at will, with a proportional output of water, and\r\nthe load had to be lifted 22 ft. above the quay and carried horizontally\r\nfrom 28 ft. beyond the edge to 16 ft. in the rear, so that the load might\r\nbe taken from a ship and deposited upon a wagon, and _vice versa_. The\r\nshears, then, had to be capable of performing two operations, viz., of\r\nlifting the load and of carrying it horizontally. To facilitate the\r\ndescription, we shall first make known the arrangements that assure the\r\nsecond operation.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is of the type known as oscillating tripod. The tripod\r\nconsists of two lateral iron plate uprights, A A (Fig. 1), resting upon\r\nthe wharf wall, and of a beam, B, jointed to them above and connected\r\nbelow with the head of the piston of a hydraulic press. This latter rests\r\nupon an iron plate frame, solidly bolted to masonry. The piston pulls the\r\nbeam, B, toward it when it descends, and carries along in the same motion\r\nthe shears, A, as well as the load suspended from their point of junction,\r\nand the load is thus carried to a distance of 16 ft. from the edge of the\r\nwharf in order to be placed upon a wagon. Conversely, if the piston rises,\r\nit pushes before it the entire framework, as well as the lifting\r\napparatus, the hook of which travels 28 ft. beyond the edge of the wharf.\r\n\r\nThe lifting apparatus consists likewise of a hydraulic press suspended\r\nfrom the summit of the tripod; but, in order to prevent the joints of the\r\ncylinder from working under the action of the load, which would tend to\r\nopen them and cause leakages, it is not suspended from the very axis of\r\nthe junction of the shears. The cylinder rests directly upon a huge\r\nstirrup 45 ft. in length, the arms alone of which are affixed to the axis,\r\nthrough a Cardan joint. Under such circumstances, the stress of the load\r\ncarried by the piston rod is exerted solely upon the branches of the\r\nstirrup, and the sides of the cylinder work only under the pressure of the\r\nmotive water. The latter is introduced at the base of the press, through a\r\nvalve that a special workman, standing upon a platform supported by the\r\nstirrup, maneuvers at will.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the general principle applied for utilizing the\r\nmotive power is that of direct action. It has already been employed in a\r\nfew analogous apparatus constructed by Sir William Armstrong, especially\r\nthose of the arsenal of Spezia and of the Elswick cannon foundry, but\r\nsolely for the lifting press. This is the first time that use has been\r\nmade of it to effect the oscillating motion corresponding to the\r\nhorizontal shifting of the load. This was formerly done through the\r\nintermedium of a mechanism that, aside from its complication and higher\r\ncost, presented the inconvenience of absorbing a large quantity of force\r\nin friction; besides, the direct action permits of performing the\r\nmaneuvers much more quickly by the use of the water in reserve contained\r\nin the accumulators.\r\n\r\nAnother important improvement, likewise due to the Compagnie Fives-Lille,\r\nconsists in the addition of safety clicks, which engage with racks\r\nparallel with the piston rod of each of the presses and movable with it.\r\nThe clicks, on the contrary, are jointed to axes fixed on the bottom of\r\nthe cylinders. This arrangement presents the following advantages: If a\r\nleakage occurs in the joints or feed pipe of the hoisting press, the\r\ndescent of the load can be stopped instantaneously, thus preventing the\r\ngrave damage that would be done to ships and even to the shears themselves\r\nby the descent of a 120 ton load, however slow it might be. As regards the\r\noscillating press, this arrangement permits of fixing the base of the\r\nconnecting beam at any point whatever of its travel, when it is desired to\r\ndismount the piston. Further, it permits of maintaining the shears in an\r\ninvariable position in case of sudden damages to the piping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--AUTOMATIC MULTIPLIER.]\r\n\r\nIn order to produce the three powers of 25, 75, and 120 tons required by\r\nthe programme, and at the same time expend in each case a corresponding\r\nquantity of water under pressure, it is of course necessary to cause the\r\npressure of the motive water to vary in the same proportion as the stress\r\nto be extended. This result is reached by calculating the diameter of the\r\ntwo cylinders in such a way as to obtain the mean power of 75 tons, in\r\nmaking the water of the general conduit act directly under the normal\r\npressure of 50 atmospheres. For the powers of 25 and 120 tons, use is made\r\nof an automatic multiplier, that consists of two cylinders arranged end to\r\nend, in which move pistons, A and B (Fig. 3), of different diameters. When\r\nit is a question of lifting 120 tons, the water at 50 atmospheres actuates\r\nthe piston, A, and the other forces into the lifting cylinder motive water\r\nunder a much greater pressure. If the load to be lifted is but 25 tons,\r\nthe water at 50 atmospheres actuates the piston, B, and A forces the water\r\ninto the same cylinder at a much lower pressure. The same operations are\r\neffected in the other cylinder when the extreme loads of 25 and 120 tons\r\nare moved.\r\n\r\nThe shears are likewise provided with a hydraulic cylinder, E (Fig. 1),\r\nplaced on the back of the beam, B, and serving, through a cable, to bring\r\nthe piston of the large cylinder to the end of its upward stroke, and for\r\ncertain accessory work.\r\n\r\nFinally, the apparatus as a whole is completed by an accumulator\r\ncontaining in reserve a large part of the water necessary for each\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is capable of lifting a maximum load of 120 tons from 22\r\nfeet beneath the wharf to 22 feet above, and of moving it from 28 feet\r\nbeyond the edge to 16 feet back of it, say a total of 44 feet. The\r\ncylinders of the lifting and oscillating presses are 1-3/4 feet in diameter\r\nand 4 inches in thickness. The stroke of the second is 22-1/2 feet. The\r\nlength of the uprights is 110-1/2 feet and that of the connecting beam is 109\r\nfeet. The apparatus has been tested under satisfactory conditions with a\r\nload of 140 tons.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE DISTRIBUTION OF HYDRAULIC POWER IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a paper on the\r\nabove subject was read by Mr. Edward Bayzand Ellington, M. Inst. C. E. The\r\nauthor observed that water power was no new force, but that, as formerly\r\nunderstood, it was limited in its application to systems of mechanism\r\nsuitable for the low pressures found in nature. The effects obtained by\r\nthe use of high pressure were so different in degree from all previous\r\nexperience, that a new name was needed, and had been found in the term\r\n\"hydraulic power.\" Bramah's genius produced the hydraulic press, and he\r\nclearly foresaw the future development and great capabilities of his\r\nsystem; but it was reserved for Lord Armstrong to work out and superintend\r\nthe intricate details that had to be developed before the system could be\r\nmade fully serviceable. The public supply of hydraulic power in London\r\nconstituted the latest development of this system. The hydraulic power was\r\nsupplied through mains charged by pumping at a pressure of 700 lb. per\r\nsquare inch. The first and largest pumping station had been erected on a\r\nsite known as Falcon Wharf, about 200 yards east of Blackfriars Bridge.\r\nThe engine house at present contained four sets of pumping engines, each\r\nset being capable of exerting 200 I. H. P.\r\n\r\nThe engines were vertical compound, of a type comprising the advantages of\r\na three-throw pump with direct connection between the pump plungers and\r\nthe steam pistons. Each set of engines would deliver 240 gallons of water\r\nper minute into the accumulators at 750 lb. pressure per square in. at a\r\npiston speed of 200 ft. per minute. This was the normal speed of working;\r\nbut, when required, they could be worked at 250 ft. per minute, the\r\nmaximum delivery being 300 gallons per minute. The condensing water was\r\nobtained from storage tanks over the engine house, and was returned by\r\ncirculating pumps to one or other of those tanks. The water delivered into\r\nthe mains was maintained all the year round at temperatures of between 60 deg.\r\nand 85 deg. The boilers were of the double flued Lancashire type, and were\r\nmade of steel. All were fitted with Vicars' mechanical stokers. At the\r\nback of the boilers was a Green's economizer, consisting of ninety-six\r\ntubes. The economizer and the stoker gear and worm were driven by a\r\nBrotherhood three cylinder hydraulic engine. The reservoir of power\r\nconsisted of accumulators. The accumulators at the pumping station were\r\ntwo in number, each having a ram 20 in. in diameter and 23 ft. stroke.\r\n\r\nThe weight cases were of wrought iron, and were filled with iron slag. The\r\ntotal weight of the case and load on each ram was approximately 106 tons,\r\ncorresponding to a pressure of 750 lb. per square in. The storage tanks\r\nformed the roofs for the engine and boiler houses. The water for the power\r\nsupply was obtained from the river Thames, and was pumped into the tank\r\nover the engines. The water passed through the filtering apparatus by\r\ngravity into the filtered water tank over the boiler house, which was 7\r\nft. below the level of the unfiltered water tank. The filters consisted of\r\ncast iron cylinders, and each contained a movable perforated piston and a\r\nperforated diaphragm, between which was introduced a quantity of broken\r\nsponge; the sponge was compressed by means of hydraulic pressure from the\r\nmains. The delivery of power water from the Falcon Wharf pumping station\r\nwas through four 6 in. mains. The most distant point of the mains from the\r\naccumulators was at the west end of Victoria Street, and was 5,320 yards,\r\nor just over three miles. To provide for all frictional loss in the pipes\r\nand valves, the accumulators had been loaded to 750 lb., the stated\r\npressure supplied being 700 lb. per square in. The total length of the\r\nmains at present laid was nearly twenty-seven miles. The mains were laid\r\nin circuit, and there were stop valves at about every 400 yards, so that\r\nany such section of main could be isolated.\r\n\r\nThe method employed for detecting leakage was based upon an automatic\r\nrecord of the number of gallons delivered into the mains, and in cases of\r\nabnormal increase during the night, if found to arise during the early\r\nhours of the morning, the mains were tested. The power water used was\r\ninvariably registered through meters on the exhaust pipes from the\r\nmachines, and from the meters passed to the drains. There was a sliding\r\nscale of charges from 8s. to 2s. per 1,000 gallons at 700 lb. pressure per\r\nsquare inch, designed to meet, as nearly as possible, the variable\r\nconditions and requirements of consumers. The more continuous the use, the\r\nlower the charges. The scale was intended chiefly for intermittently\r\nacting machinery, and experience had fully proved that these rates were\r\nsufficiently low to effect a large saving to the consumer in almost all\r\ncases, whether for a large or a small plant. The author believed any idea\r\nof supplying power from a central source at rates much below these to be\r\nchimerical. The practical efficiency of the hydraulic system might be\r\nfixed at from 50 to 60 per cent. of the power developed at the central\r\nstation. No other method of transmission would, he thought, show a better\r\nresult; and the general convenience and simplicity of the hydraulic system\r\nwere such that its use would hardly be affected, even if there were no\r\ndirect economy in the cost of working.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general supply of hydraulic power, in the City and\r\nadjoining districts, to the six hundred and fifty machines at present\r\nworked, a new departure had been taken by the application of hydraulic\r\npower to an estate at Kensington Court--the name given to an area of about\r\nseven acres opposite Kensington Gardens. Seventy houses and dwellings were\r\nto be built on this estate, of which thirty had been already erected. Each\r\nhouse was fitted with a hydraulic lift, taking the place of a back\r\nstaircase, and the power supply was provided on the estate expressly for\r\nworking these lifts. The driven machinery was of as great importance to an\r\neconomical and satisfactory result as the distributing plant, but this\r\nobvious fact was not always understood. General regulations had been\r\nprepared by the author, defining the conditions to be observed by\r\nmanufacturers in fitting up machinery for connection to the power mains.\r\n\r\nThey were intended to secure safety, and an efficient registration of the\r\nquantity of power used; but they left the question of the economy and of\r\nthe efficiency of the machines to be settled between the consumers and the\r\nmakers. In London more lifts were working from the mains and more power\r\nwas used by them than by any other description of machinery. The number of\r\nall classes at present at work was over four hundred. The principal types\r\nin use were fully described. In some cases there had been, by adopting the\r\npublic supply, a saving in the cost of working of about 30 per cent., as\r\ncompared with the steam pumping plant previously in use.\r\n\r\nLifts were now becoming so general, and the number of persons who used\r\nthem was so great, that the author considered it necessary to urge the\r\nimportance of securing the greatest possible safety in their construction,\r\nby the general adoption of the simple ram. Suspended lifts depended on the\r\nsound condition of the ropes or chains from which the cages hung. As they\r\nbecame worn and unreliable after a short period, it was usual to add\r\nsafety appliances to stop the fall of the cage in case of breakage of the\r\nsuspending ropes; but they could not be expected to act under all\r\ncircumstances. As an indication of the important part which lifts occupied\r\nin a modern hotel, it might be mentioned that at the Hotel Metropole there\r\nwere, including the two passenger lifts and that for the passengers'\r\nluggage, no less than seventeen hydraulic lifts in use day and night,\r\nwhile the work done represented about 2,000 tons lifted 40 ft. in this\r\ntime. The next largest use of the power was for working hydraulic cranes\r\nand hoists of various kinds along the river side, and in the city\r\nwarehouses. It often happened that the pressure in the power mains was not\r\nsufficient for pressing purposes.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus known as an intensifier was then used, by which any pressure\r\nrequired could be obtained. Hydraulic power was also used at Westminster\r\nChambers, and elsewhere, for the purpose of pumping water from the chalk\r\nfor domestic use. The pump was set going in the evening and continued\r\nworking till the tanks were full, or until it was stopped in the morning.\r\nFor work of this kind, done exclusively at night, a discount was allowed\r\nfrom the usual rates. Mr. Greathead's injector hydrant, made at the\r\nElswick works, had been in use to a limited extent in London in connection\r\nwith the power mains.\r\n\r\nA small jet of high pressure water, injected into a larger jet from the\r\nwater works mains, intensified the pressure of the latter in the delivery\r\nhose, and also increased the quantity. By this means a jet of great power\r\ncould be obtained at the top of the highest building without the\r\nintervention of fire engines. This apparatus enabled the hydraulic power\r\nsupply to act as a continuous fire engine wherever the mains were laid,\r\nand was capable of rendering the greatest assistance in the extinction of\r\nfire; but there was an apathy on the subject of its use difficult to\r\nunderstand. In Hull the corporation had put down a number of these\r\nhydrants in High Street, where the hydraulic power mains were laid, and\r\nthey had been used with great success at a fire in that street. The number\r\nof machines under contract to be supplied with power was sufficient, with\r\na suitable reserve, to absorb the full capacity of the station at Falcon\r\nWharf, and another station of about equal capacity was now in course of\r\nerection at Millbank Street, Westminster. The works had been carried out\r\njointly by the author and Mr. Corbet Woodall, M. Inst. C. E.; Mr. G.\r\nCochrane had been resident engineer and superintendent. The pumping\r\nengines, accumulators, valves, etc., and a considerable portion of the\r\nconsumers' machinery, had been constructed at the Hydraulic Engineering\r\nWorks, Chester. Sir James Allport, Assoc. Inst. C. E., who was the first\r\nto adopt hydraulic power for railway work, had been associated with the\r\nenterprise from the commencement of its operations in 1882. His wide\r\ninfluence and extended experience had greatly assisted the commercial\r\ndevelopment of the undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          TEST OF A WROUGHT IRON DOUBLE TRACK FLOOR BEAM.[1]\r\n\r\n               By ALFRED P. BOLLER, Mem. Am. Soc. C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting to rupture actual bridge members is always a matter of great\r\nscientific interest, and while the record is quite extensive in eye bars,\r\nposts, or small parts, the great cost, time, and inconvenience of handling\r\nheavy girders has prevented experiment in that direction. In fact, the\r\nwriter is unaware of any experiment upon compound riveted beams on a large\r\nscale, as actually used, until the experiment recorded below was made\r\nunder his supervision. The beam was an exact duplicate of those in use on\r\na bridge, about which more or less controversy had arisen as to their\r\npractical safety, and the test was made under, as near as possible, actual\r\nconditions of attachment and loading. The annexed drawing shows the form\r\nand proportion of the beam and connection with the posts, together with\r\nthe position of the track stringers. The actual static loads to which the\r\nbeam could be subjected by the heaviest engines in use on the road, with\r\nweight of floor, is 40,000 lb. at each stringer bearing, the strains\r\ncomputed therefrom being as follows: Flange strains at _m_, 3,800 lb. per\r\nsquare inch; at _a_, 5,700 lb. per square inch; at _b_, 6,400 lb. per\r\nsquare inch. Shear strains in web, between _a_ and _b_, 2,600 lb. per\r\nsquare inch. Shear strains in web, between _a_ and end, 8,000 lb. per\r\nsquare inch at least section, or where the web is 2 feet 4 inches deep, or\r\n42 diameters between angle iron.\r\n\r\n[1] Abstract of a paper read before the American Society of Civil\r\nEngineers, November 16, 1887.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Rivets._--All rivets 7/8 inch diameter, or 15/26 inch when driven to fill\r\nholes; area of section, 0.6 square inch; bearing area, diameter x 3/8\r\nplate = 0.35 square inch, and for 1/2 inch plate 0.47 square inch. Post\r\nattachment, considering all the twenty-six rivets doing duty, yields\r\nrivet strain as follows: In shear, single 5,000 lb. per square inch: and\r\nbearing area--1/2 inch plate--6,600 lb. per square inch.\r\n\r\n_Connection of 3/8 Web to Flange Angles._--Taking the forty rivets between\r\nends of girder and second stringer, the horizontal strain difference is\r\n162,000 lb., the rivets being strained 3,400 lb. per square inch double\r\nshear, and 11,600 lb. per square inch bearing area. Taking distance from\r\nends to first stringer, the horizontal strain difference is 105,000 lb.,\r\nyielding on twenty rivets 4,200 lb. per square inch double shear, and\r\n15,000 lb. per square inch bearing area. Taking a short distance of 2 feet\r\nfrom ends, the horizontal strain is 70,000 lb. on ten rivets, giving 5,800\r\nlb. per square inch double shear, and 20,000 lb. per square inch bearing\r\narea. In these girders the weakness feared was in the end flange riveting\r\nand shear in end web, and caused the test recorded below. The test was\r\nrecently made at the works of the Keystone Bridge Company, by means of\r\nhydraulic power applied at stringer points. Convenience made it necessary\r\nto make the test with the beam blocked up horizontal on the ground, so\r\nthat the weight of the beam is necessarily neglected. The beam was\r\nconnected with a pair of posts, precisely as in the actual structure,\r\nbetween which an additional girder was framed as a reaction base for the\r\nrams. The annexed diagram shows the general arrangements. The hydraulic\r\npower was derived from the testing machine plant of the Keystone\r\nestablishment, and the deflections measured from a fine wire parallel to\r\nthe lower flange, and about 3 inches therefrom. The diameter of the ram\r\nwas 10 inches; area 78.54 inches. The record was as follows:\r\n\r\n   Gauge    Load on               Deflections.

From some cause not apparent the deflections were not similar\r\nat the symmetrical end rams, _a_, the point where the web failed--left\r\nside--being sharply deflected. While the angles showed root fracture at\r\nthe opposite point, the web did not fail or show indications of so doing,\r\nthe deflection being on an easy curve. With the extreme yielding of the\r\nlower flange angles, the angle brackets connecting girder with posts\r\ncommenced to go, tearing likewise along the root, and stripping the heads\r\nfrom the extreme upper rivets as shown. The internal diaphragm connecting\r\nthe channel sides of the posts was unaffected. The rivets connecting the\r\nruptured flange with web appeared as perfect as when driven, and no\r\nindication was disclosed, as far as it was possible to tell, of the holes\r\nin the web elongating or any upsetting of bearing surface. There is no\r\ntelling what the web and rivets would have borne had not the solid angle\r\nirons given way at the first bend. It is to be noted that flange plate\r\nwith leg of angle attached thereto was intact, showing no indication of\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\n_Discussion._--Taking that stage of the experiment when a permanent set\r\nwas first noted--viz., 1/32 inch--the recorded load was 532,500 lb., or as\r\nnear as may be 3-1/3 times the basis on which the calculations in the\r\nfirst part of this paper were made--40,000 lb. on each stringer, or\r\n160,000 lb. total. Applying this ratio to the preceding computations, the\r\niron would be apparently strained as follows:\r\n\r\n             { _m_ 3,800 x 3-1/3 = 12,600 lb. per square inch (psi).\r\n  Flanges at { _a_ 5,700 x 3-1/3 = 19,000 psi.\r\n             { _b_ 6,400 x 3-1/3 = 21,200 psi.\r\n\r\n  Web.  { Between _a_ and _b_, 2,600 x 3-1/3 = 8,700 lb. per square inch.\r\n        { At least section, 8,000 x 3-1/3 = 26,600 psi.\r\n\r\n          { Post attachment:\r\n          {  Bearing area,  6,600 x 3-1/3 = 22,000 lb. per square inch.\r\n          {  Single shear,  5,000 x 3-1/3 = 16,600 psi.\r\n  Rivets. { Web and flange connections, end rivets:\r\n          {  Bearing area, 20,000 x 3-1/3 = 66,600 psi.\r\n          {  Double shear,  5,800 x 3-1/3 = 19,300 psi.\r\n\r\nWhen failure in angles was first noted, the recorded load was 653,500 lb.,\r\nor slightly more than four times the computed basis of load, which would\r\nincrease the above strains about one-fifth, giving a calculated flange\r\nstrain when angle failed of some 15,000 lb. per square inch, and bearing\r\narea strain on end flange and web rivets about 80,000 lb. per square inch,\r\nneither of which could possibly be true, or the web would have torn out\r\nfrom the rivets, and the flanges be perfectly sound, well within elastic\r\nlimits, although in the last case it is to be noted that the horizontal\r\ntable of the flange was perfectly sound, the flange failure commencing\r\nprimarily with a long split along the weld of the angle iron root,\r\nthrowing the whole flange duty upon the vertical legs of the angle iron,\r\nwhen a rupture strain was quickly reached. Had the angles been rolled from\r\na solid ingot, or on the German method of developing from a flat instead\r\nof from the ordinary welded pile, the strength of this beam would have\r\nbeen largely increased. The prime weakness in this beam was due,\r\ntherefore, to the mode of manufacturing the angle irons, which were weak\r\nalong the weld at the root. This was also shown in the end bracket angles\r\nuniting the beam to the posts. The writer deduces from this experiment\r\nthat a plate web is an exceedingly stiff member, much stiffer than is\r\ncommonly supposed; that the customary method of proportioning\r\nrivets--viz., the horizontal component between any two given points\r\ndivided by allowable bearing pressure per square inch equals number of\r\nrivets required--is not true, and that the friction due to power riveting\r\nhas enormous value. This beam was reported to the company interested as\r\npractically safe by the writer, on general considerations, before the\r\nexperiment was made, and the opinion reaffirmed after the experiment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLondon Bridge cost $10,000,000.

Henry Bessemer\r\n& Co., of Sheffield, for Mr. Samuel Walker, of Birmingham, for the\r\nmanufacture of tubes of large size, and also for making hollow steel\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\nThe press is made entirely of Bessemer steel, and is of the three-column\r\nconstruction, a strong casting of triangular form serving as a base of the\r\npress; into this casting the three columns fit, and carry on their upper\r\nends a like casting, forming a top or entablature. Into this top casting\r\nthe main cylinder is fixed mouth downward, concentric with the machine.\r\nTwo small cylinders for giving the return or upward stroke rest mouth\r\nupward in the bottom casting at opposite sides. The two rams of these\r\ncylinders pass through the ends of, and carry, a crosshead, upon which the\r\nmain ram rests. The two lifting rams are made long enough to pass through\r\nholes in the top casting, and thus form guides to the crosshead and\r\nmandrel.\r\n\r\nThe main ram is 24 in. in diameter, and has a stroke of 12 ft. The press\r\nis worked at a pressure of 3 tons per square inch, giving a down force of\r\n1,300 tons. The two lifting rams are each 8-1/2 in. in diameter, and give an\r\nupward force of 300 tons. This large upward force is required for\r\nstripping the tubes off the mandrels, in addition to raising the main ram\r\ncrosshead, etc.\r\n\r\nReferring to the engraving, the main cylinder is seen at the top with the\r\nmain ram carrying the crosshead, to which are connected the two lifting\r\nrams, the cylinders for which extend below ground. By this arrangement a\r\nreciprocating motion is obtained, rams only being used, the central ram\r\ngiving the downward thrust, and the two smaller side rams giving the\r\nupward stroke.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker has this press in operation, and from a disk of steel 3 ft. in\r\ndiameter, having a mean thickness of about 4 in., he has raised a tube or\r\ncylinder with a solid end to it 3 ft. 6 in. long and 12 in. in diameter,\r\nof a uniform thickness of about 1 in., and sanguine hopes are entertained\r\nof producing greater results. Messrs. Bessemer & Co. are now making a\r\nlarger press of similar construction.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        TIMBER, AND SOME OF ITS DISEASES.[2] By H. MARSHALL WARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\nIf we turn our attention for a moment to the illustrations in the first\r\narticle, it will be remembered that our typical log of timber was clothed\r\nin a sort of jacket termed the cortex, the outer parts of which constitute\r\nwhat is generally known as the bark. This cortical covering is separated\r\nfrom the wood proper by the cambium, and I pointed out that the cells\r\nproduced by divisions on the outside of the cambium cylinder are employed\r\nto add to the cortex.\r\n\r\n[2] Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 644, page 10281.\r\n\r\nNow this cortical jacket is a very complicated structure, since it not\r\nonly consists of numerous elements, differing in different trees, but it\r\nalso undergoes some very curious changes as the plant grows up into a\r\ntree. It is beyond the purpose of these articles to enter in detail into\r\nthese anatomical matters, however; and I must refer the reader to special\r\ntext books for them, simply contenting myself here with general truths\r\nwhich will serve to render clearer certain statements which are to follow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--A piece of the cambium and cortical jacket of a\r\nyoung oak, at the end of the first year. It may be regarded as consisting\r\nof three parts, in addition to the cambium, C_a_. Beginning from the\r\noutside, we have: 1. Cork cells, X, formed from the cork cambium, C.C_a_:\r\nthe cells developed on the inside of the latter, C_l_, are termed\r\ncollenchyma, and go to add to the cortex. 2. The cortex proper, consisting\r\nof parenchyma cells, _pa_, some of which contain crystals. 3. The inner or\r\nsecondary cortex (termed _phloem_ or bast), developed chiefly by the\r\nactivity of the cambium, C_a_: this phloem consists of hard bast fibers,\r\n_hb_, sieve tubes, S, and cells, _c_, and is added to internally by the\r\ncambium, C_a_, each year. It is also traversed by medullary rays, M_r_,\r\nwhich are continuations of those in the wood. The dotted line, [psi], in\r\nthe cortical parenchyma indicates where the new cork cambium will be\r\ndeveloped: when this is formed, all the tissues (e.g. _pa_, C_l_) lying on\r\nthe outside of the new cork will die, and constitute (together with the\r\ncork) the true _bark_.]\r\n\r\nIt is possible to make two generalizations, which apply not only to the\r\nillustration (Fig. 20) here selected, but also to most of our timber\r\ntrees. In the first place, the cortical jacket, taken as a whole, consists\r\nnot of rigid lignified elements, such as the tracheids and fibers of the\r\nwood, but of thin-walled, soft, elastic elements of various kinds, which\r\nare easily compressed or displaced, and for the most part easily killed or\r\ninjured--I say for the most part easily injured, because, as we shall see\r\nimmediately, a reservation must be made in favor of the outermost tissue,\r\nor cork and bark proper, which is by no means so easily destroyed, and\r\nacts as a protection to the rest.\r\n\r\nThe second generalization is, that since the cambium adds new elements to\r\nthe cortex on the inside of the latter, and since the cambium cylinder as\r\na whole is traveling radially outward--_i.e._, further from the pith--each\r\nyear, as follows from its mode of adding the new annual rings of wood on\r\nto the exterior of the older ones, it is clear that the cortical jacket as\r\na whole must suffer distention from within, and tend to become too small\r\nfor the enlarging cylinder of rigid wood and growing cambium combined.\r\nIndeed, it is not difficult to see that unless certain provisions are made\r\nfor keeping up the continuity of the cortical tissues, they must give way\r\nunder the pressure from within. As we shall see, such a catastrophe is in\r\npart prevented by a very peculiar and efficient process.\r\n\r\nBefore we can understand this, however, we must take a glance at the\r\nstructural characters of the whole of this jacket (Fig. 20). While the\r\nbranch or stem is still young, it may be conveniently considered as\r\nconsisting of three chief parts.\r\n\r\n(1) On the outside is a thin layer of flat, tabular cork cells (Fig. 20,\r\nC_o_), which increase in number by the activity of certain layers of cells\r\nalong a plane parallel to the surface of the stem or branch. These cells\r\n(C.C_a_) behave very much like the proper cambium, only the cells divided\r\noff from them do not undergo the profound changes suffered by those which\r\nare to become elements of the wood and inner cortex. The cells formed on\r\nthe outside of the line C.C_a_ in fact simply become cork cells; while\r\nthose formed on the inside of the line C.C_a_ become living cells (C_l_)\r\nvery like those I am now going to describe.\r\n\r\n(2) Inside this cork-forming layer is a mass of soft, thin-walled \"juicy\"\r\ncells, _pa_, which are all living, and most of which contain granules of\r\nchlorophyl, and thus give the green color to the young cortex--a color\r\nwhich becomes toned down to various shades of olive, gray, brown, etc., as\r\nthe layers of cork increase with the age of the part. It is because the\r\ncorky layers are becoming thicker that the twig passes from green to gray\r\nor brown as it grows older. Now, these green living cells of the cortex\r\nare very important for our purpose, because, since they contain much food\r\nmaterial and soft juicy contents of just the kind to nourish a parasitic\r\nfungus, we shall find that, whenever they are exposed by injury, etc.,\r\nthey constitute an important place of weakness--nay, more, various fungi\r\nare adapted in most peculiar ways to get at them. Since these cells are\r\nfor the most part living, and capable of dividing, also, we have to\r\nconsider the part they play in increasing the extent of the cortex.\r\n\r\n(3) The third of the partly natural, partly arbitrary portions into which\r\nwe are dividing the cortical jacket is found between the green, succulent\r\ncells (_pa_) of the cortex proper (which we have just been considering)\r\nand the proper cambium, C_a_, and it may be regarded as entirely formed\r\ndirectly from the cambium cells. These latter, developed in smaller\r\nnumbers on the outside, toward the cortex, than on the inside, toward the\r\nwood, undergo somewhat similar changes in shape to those which go to add\r\nto the wood, but they show the important differences that their walls\r\nremain unlignified, and for the most part very thin and yielding, and\r\nretain their living contents. For the rest, we may neglect details and\r\nrefer to the illustration for further particulars. The tissue in question\r\nis marked by S, _c_, _hb_ in the figure, and is called _phloem_ or bast.\r\n\r\nA word or two as to the functions of the cortex, though the subject\r\nproperly demands much longer discussion. It may be looked upon as\r\nespecially the part through which the valuable substances formed in the\r\nleaves are passing in various directions to be used where they are wanted.\r\nWhen we reflect that these substances are the foods from which everything\r\nin the tree--new cambium, new roots, buds, flowers, and fruit, etc.--are\r\nto be constructed, it becomes clear that if any enemy settles in the\r\ncortex and robs it of these substances, it reduces not only the general\r\npowers of the tree, but also--and this is the point which especially\r\ninterests us now--its timber-producing capacity. In the same way, anything\r\nwhich cuts or injures the continuity of the cortical layers results in\r\ndiverting the nutritive substances into other channels. A very large class\r\nof phenomena can be explained if these points are understood, which would\r\nbe mysterious, or at least obscure, otherwise.\r\n\r\nHaving now sketched the condition of this cortical jacket when the branch\r\nor stem is still young, it will be easy to see broadly what occurs as it\r\nthickens with age.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is clear that the continuous sheet of cork (C_o_)\r\nmust first be extended, and finally ruptured, by the pressure exerted from\r\nwithin. It is true, this layer is very elastic and extensible, and\r\nimpervious to water or nearly so--in fact, it is a thin layer or skin,\r\nwith properties like those of a bottle cork--but even it must give way as\r\nthe cylinder goes on expanding, and it cracks and peels off. This would\r\nexpose the delicate tissues below, if it were not for the fact that\r\nanother layer of cork has by this time begun to form below the one which\r\nis ruptured: a cork-forming layer arises along the line [phi] and busily\r\nproduces another sheet of this protective tissue in a plane more or less\r\nexactly parallel with the one which is becoming cracked. This new\r\ncork-forming tissue behaves as before: the outer cells become cork, the\r\ninner ones add to the green succulent parenchyma cells (_pa_). As years go\r\non, and this layer in its turn splits and peels, others are formed further\r\ninward, and if it is remembered that a layer of cork is particularly\r\nimpervious to water and air, it is easy to understand that each successive\r\nsheet of cork cuts off all the tissues on its exterior from participation\r\nin the life processes of the plant: consequently we have a gradually\r\nincreasing _bark_ proper, formed of the accumulated cork layers and other\r\ndead tissues.\r\n\r\nA great number of interesting points, important in their proper\r\nconnections, must be passed over here. Some of these refer to the anatomy\r\nof the various \"barks\"--the word \"bark\" being commonly used in commerce to\r\nmean the whole of the cortical jacket--the places of origin of the cork\r\nlayer, and the way in which the true bark peels off: those further\r\ninterested here may compare the plane, the birch, the Scotch pine, and the\r\nelm, for instance, with the oak. Other facts have reference to the\r\nchemical and other substances found in the cells of the cortex, and which\r\nmake \"barks\" of value commercially. I need only quote the alkaloids in\r\ncinchona, the fibers in the malveceae, the tannin in the oaks, the coloring\r\nmatter in _Garcinia_ (gamboge), the gutta percha from _Isonandra_, the\r\nethereal oil of cinnamon, as a few examples in this connection, since our\r\nimmediate subject does not admit of a detailed treatment of these\r\nextremely interesting matters.\r\n\r\nThe above brief account may suffice to give a general idea of what the\r\ncortical jacket covering our timber is, and how it comes about that in the\r\nnormal case the thickening of the cylinder is rendered possible without\r\nexposing the cambium and other delicate tissues: it may also serve to show\r\nwhy bark is so various in composition and other characters. But it is also\r\nclear that this jacket of coherent bark, bound together by the elastic\r\nsheets of cork, must exert considerable pressure as it reacts on the\r\nsofter, living, succulent parts of the cortex, trapped as they are between\r\nthe rigid wood cylinder and the bark; and it is easy to convince\r\nourselves that such is the case. By simply cutting a longitudinal slit\r\nthrough the cortex, down to near the cambium, but taking care not to\r\ninjure the latter, the following results may be obtained. First, the bark\r\ngapes, the raw edges of the wound separating and exposing the tissues\r\nbelow; next in course of time the raw edges are seen to be healed over\r\nwith cork--produced by the conversion of the outer cells into cork cells.\r\nAs time passes, provided no external interference occurs, the now rounded\r\nand somewhat swollen cork-covered edges of the wound will be found closing\r\nup again; and sooner or later, depending chiefly on the extent of the\r\nwound and the vigor of the tree, the growing lips of the wound will come\r\ntogether and unite completely.\r\n\r\nBut examination will show that although such a slit wound is so easily\r\nhealed over, it has had an effect on the wood. Supposing it has required\r\nthree years to heal over, it will be found that the new annual rings of\r\nwood are a little thicker just below the slit; this is simply because the\r\nslit had released the pressure on the cambium. The converse has also been\r\nproved to be true--_i.e._, by increasing the pressure on the cambium by\r\nmeans of iron bands, the annual rings below the bands are thinner and\r\ndenser than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut we have also seen that the cambium is not the only living tissue below\r\nthe bark: the cortical parenchyma (_pa_) and the cells (_c_) of the inner\r\ncortex (technically the phloem) are all living and capable of growth and\r\ndivision, as was described above. The release from pressure affects them\r\nalso; in fact, the \"callus,\" or cushion of tissue which starts from the\r\nlips of the wound and closes it over, simply consists of the rapidly\r\ngrowing and dividing cells of this cortex, _i.e._, the release from\r\npressure enables them to more than catch up the enlarging layer of cortex\r\naround the wound.\r\n\r\nAn elegant and simple instance of this accelerated growth of the cortex\r\nand cambium when released from the pressure of other tissues is exhibited\r\nin the healing over of the cut ends of a branch, a subject to be dealt\r\nwith later on; and the whole practice of propagation by slips or cuttings,\r\nthe renewal of the \"bark\" of cinchonas, and other economic processes,\r\ndepend on these matters.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of some points to be explained only if these phenomena are\r\nunderstood, I may simply remark here that, obviously, if some parasite\r\nattacks the growing lips of the \"callus\" as it is trying to cover up the\r\nwound, or if the cambium is injured below, the pathological disturbances\r\nthus introduced will modify the result: the importance of this will appear\r\nwhen we come to examine certain disturbances which depend upon the attacks\r\nof fungi which settle on these wounds before they are properly healed\r\nover. In concluding this brief sketch of a large subject, it may be noted\r\nthat, generally speaking, what has been stated of branches, etc., is also\r\ntrue of roots; and it is easy to see how the nibbling or gnawing of small\r\nanimals, the pecking of birds, abrasions, and numerous other things, are\r\nso many causes of such wounds in the forest.\r\n\r\n                          (_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SIBLEY COLLEGE LECTURES.--1887-88.\r\n\r\n      BY THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY NON-RESIDENT LECTURERS IN MECHANICAL\r\n                              ENGINEERING.\r\n\r\n             III.--THE EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN MILL.[3]\r\n\r\n                  By C. J. H. WOODBURY, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BELT TOWERS.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of power has not always received the judicious treatment\r\nwhich its importance deserves. There are but few references to this\r\nquestion in the books on the subject, and these treat of methods that are\r\nnot in accordance with the application of the art in its present state.\r\n\r\n[3] Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 647, page 10331.\r\n\r\nThe lecture was illustrated by about fifty views on the screen, which\r\ncannot be reproduced here, showing photographs of mills and mechanical\r\ndrawings of the methods of construction alluded to in the lecture.\r\n\r\nThe early form of the distribution of power consisted in placing a\r\nvertical shaft extending through the whole mill and distributing the power\r\nat each story by means of beveled gears, generally of skew-beveled form.\r\nThe mechanical defects of such a method of distributing power, with regard\r\nto protection, repairs, and necessary care, are readily apparent, and\r\nthere have also been many severe accidents caused by the breaking of teeth\r\nin these gears.\r\n\r\nThe present method of distributing power in this country is entirely by\r\nlines of belts extending up through what is known as a belt tower, which\r\nconstitutes an element of great fire hazard to a mill. In some cases the\r\nbelts are carried from story to story, covered by a casing of wood, and in\r\nother instances the tower forms a flue which may be the means of the rapid\r\nspread of fire throughout the building.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of automatic sprinklers there was not, I believe,\r\na single instance of a fire entering the lower portion of a belt tower\r\nduring working hours without accomplishing the destruction of the mill.\r\nSince the equipment of such places with automatic sprinklers, there have\r\nbeen several fires of this nature extinguished with nearly nominal damage.\r\nThat is to say, the hazard of fire starting in such places is beyond the\r\ncapacity of any apparatus other than automatic sprinklers to cope with it.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to arrange the distribution of power in many mills\r\nto conform to conditions of safety without reorganizing the whole plant,\r\nwhich would, of course, be impracticable. But in many instances\r\nmodifications can be introduced which will diminish the hazard to a great\r\ndegree. When the pulleys and belting are covered with sheathing in each\r\nroom, the continuity of these flues can be broken by removing this\r\nsheathing down to the height of four or five feet above the floor, so that\r\nthe covering will merely constitute a physical protection to any one\r\napproaching the belting.\r\n\r\nThe best method of arranging the belt tower has been in the case of a mill\r\nat Fall River, which was erected upon the ruins of a building destroyed by\r\na fire originating in the belt tower. The machinery is driven by a steam\r\nengine situated in an ell projecting from one side at about the middle of\r\nthe mill; and the main belt communicates to pulleys in a stone masonry\r\ntower located directly inside the walls of the main mill; and thence,\r\nfrom pulley to pulley, the power is communicated to each floor by shafting\r\npassing through holes left in the tower, and in no instances by means of\r\nbelts.\r\n\r\nThere is a separate stairway inside of the tower for lubricating the\r\njournals, etc., and the top of the tower is covered with skylights\r\nprotected underneath by a wire netting. In case of a fire in the belt\r\ntower, the heat will readily break the glass at the top, and the fire will\r\ntend to go up and out of the tower rather than through the mill.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MILL FLOORS.\r\n\r\nThe questions involved in designing the floors of a mill are of great\r\nimportance, contributing in no small measure to elements concerned in the\r\nsuccessful operation of the mill, and to a greater extent to its standing\r\nas a fire risk, and therefore affecting the constant expense of insurance.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a building designed merely for sustaining of loads, as in a\r\nstorehouse, a floor would naturally be designed on the basis of\r\nconsidering the breaking strength of the timber. But in the case of a\r\nmill, the limitation is the amount of flexure allowable under the\r\ncircumstances; and therefore the floors of the building are made more\r\nnearly rigid than would be required merely from the consideration of the\r\nultimate strength of the structure.\r\n\r\nThe books on the subject, repeating over a constant which was first, I\r\nbelieve, given by Brunel in testimony before a parliamentary commission,\r\nhave held that one four-hundredth of a span is the proper ratio of\r\nflexure. This may have been a very good rule to give to the parliamentary\r\ncommission, but it is hardly the practical method of limitation for a\r\nmatter of engineering construction, because the flexure of a loaded beam\r\nis in the form of a curve, and therefore its law is that of a curvilinear\r\nfunction, and not of a straight line. I have examined a great number of\r\nprecedents of good construction in this connection, and for mill use have\r\ndeduced the formula for deflection in inches, _d_ = 0.0012 L squared, in which L\r\nis the length of span in feet. It will be readily recognized that the true\r\nconstant of deflection of span is measured by the radius of curvature\r\nwhich will give a uniform and allowable distortion to the floor in either\r\ndirection to the limit of the radius upon which this formula is based,\r\nwhich is 1,250 feet.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to offer to you on this occasion any remarks in regard to\r\nthe treatment of the mathematics of the problem of applied mechanics\r\nconcerned in the questions of transverse stress, knowing that you have\r\ncertainly received instruction upon these subjects. But referring to the\r\nquestions of mill floors, I would state that Southern pine beams of solid\r\ntimber twelve by fourteen up to fourteen by sixteen inches are used; and\r\ninstead of attempting the use of one piece of timber, it is preferable to\r\nuse two pieces of the same depth and of half the breadth. These should be\r\nbolted together, with a space of an inch or so between them left by\r\nplacing small vertical pieces of wood between the timbers when they are\r\nbolted together. In this manner one is more sure of sound timber, and in\r\nthe process of seasoning there is less liability of dry rot in the\r\ninterior, or of injurious checking, warping, or twisting.\r\n\r\nThe end of the beams should rest upon iron plates in the masonry, and\r\nshould be secured by means of a tongue upon the plate entering a groove\r\nacross the lower side of the beam. It is not feasible to make this groove\r\nto a close fit with the tongue; but it is cut a great deal larger, and the\r\nwhole brought to a firm bearing by means of pairs of wedges or quoins\r\ndriven into the groove each side of the iron tongue.\r\n\r\nThe outer end of the plate contains ribs or tongues reaching down into the\r\nbrickwork. In this manner the timber is securely fastened to the\r\nbrickwork; and yet in time of accident or of fire the falling of the beam\r\nin the middle of the mill will raise it up sufficiently so that it will\r\nclear the tongue and fall without tearing the wall down, which is the case\r\nwhenever the beams are secured by bolts entering the end of the beam from\r\nthe face of the wall.\r\n\r\nAt the points of support in a line of columns, the beams should be free\r\nfrom all compressive stress, transmitted through the lines of columns from\r\nfloors above, by means of iron pintles between the cap of one column and\r\nthe floor of the next one carrying this load.\r\n\r\nA faulty method of construction, quite frequently used, consists in\r\ncovering each column with a bolster of timber, four or five feet long,\r\nreaching out under the floor beams.\r\n\r\nThe transverse contraction of wood in seasoning after it is in position in\r\nthe mill varies from three-eighths of an inch to double that quantity per\r\nfoot; and the aggregation of such shrinkage amounts to a very considerable\r\ndistortion or settling of the floor in a mill of several stories.\r\nMoreover, the resistance of timber to transverse crushing has been shown\r\nby experiments on the testing machine at the United States arsenal at\r\nWatertown to be about three times the resistance to longitudinal crushing.\r\n\r\nIron columns for mills have been entirely displaced by those of timber, as\r\nit was found that the latter were more reliable in resistance to fire,\r\nwere freer from defects in construction, and possessed less tendency to\r\nvibration. A series of tests on full-sized mill columns of various forms\r\nof construction and age, made in the experiments referred to, at the\r\nWatertown arsenal, showed that resistance to crushing of Southern pine\r\ncolumns was about 4,500 pounds to the square inch, and remarkably uniform\r\nas to the different results. In white oak there was a wider range, owing\r\nto the difference in the grain of the various samples, the generality of\r\nthe specimens being of somewhat less resistance than that of Southern\r\npine.\r\n\r\nIt was furthermore found by these experiments, on comparing the crushing\r\nresistance of a full-sized column with that of a portion of the same,\r\nperhaps two feet in length, that the results were practically identical,\r\nlikewise that within the limits of construction used for these columns the\r\nquestion of flexure did not enter at all in the problem, but they gave way\r\nby direct crushing, and that the resistance to crushing was proportional\r\nto its load upon the minimum cross section.\r\n\r\nThe precedents of safe construction in this matter show that wood columns\r\nin mills have successfully sustained for many years a load of six hundred\r\npounds to the square inch without deterioration. As the resistance of\r\nsuch columns is proportional to the cross section, the results of these\r\nexperiments have changed the practice of mill engineers in the matter; and\r\nsquare columns are of almost universal use, which interfere with no\r\ngreater area on the floor than the round column of the same diameter,\r\nwhile they furnish an increased resistance of a little over twenty per\r\ncent. in excess.\r\n\r\nAlong the axis of such columns a hole of about one and one-half inches in\r\ndiameter is bored, and near each end a couple of transverse holes,\r\ngenerally half an inch in diameter, furnish means of ventilating the\r\ninside of the column for the prevention of dry rot and also checking, due\r\nto contraction and seasoning.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods of laying the floor plank upon these beams,\r\nwhich are placed from eight to ten feet apart, according to the dimensions\r\nof the machinery to be placed in the mill. The first floor of three-inch\r\nplank, planed on one side and grooved on both edges, is laid planed side\r\ndown, and the hardwood splines are inserted into the grooves before the\r\nplanks are pressed up and spiked to the beams. An agreeable finish is\r\nsometimes arranged underneath by plowing a rabbet in each of the corners,\r\nand inserting a bead in the groove thus formed, which is secured by nails\r\ndriven diagonally into the plank on one side only, because if the nails\r\nwere driven into both sides, the bead would be split by the contraction of\r\nthe plank.\r\n\r\nThese planks should be cut to sufficient length to cover two bays of the\r\nmill; and their transverse resistance is that of a beam fixed at one end\r\nand supported at the other, or one and three-fifths as much as a plank of\r\nthe same size but half the length would support; but it should be\r\nremembered in this connection that, if evenly distributed on the floor,\r\nfive-eighths of the load would be carried by every alternate beam unless\r\nthe planks are so laid to break joints at convenient intervals of about\r\nthree feet.\r\n\r\nThe top flooring is generally laid directly upon the floor plank, with one\r\nor two thicknesses of roofing paper interposed; but the preferable method,\r\nwhich deadens the sound and vibration, and also greatly increases the\r\nfire-resisting qualities of the structure, is to lay a coat of mortar on\r\nthe floor plank, preserving the uniform thickness by means of furring\r\nplaced about sixteen inches apart, and then to lay the upper floor upon\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nFor these upper floors hardwood plank, one and one-fourth inches thick,\r\nand not over four inches wide, is used. The black birch is considered by\r\nmany to possess the greater resistance to wear; and Southern pine is\r\nranked next, although the latter wood gives trouble by stringing,\r\nespecially when trucks are rolled over it. White maple forms an excellent\r\ntop floor, although not so hard as others, especially where the floor is\r\nlikely to be exposed to water, as in paper mills and bleacheries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ROOFS.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin once said that next to a good foundation a good roof was\r\nthe most important feature of a building. Although the constructive\r\nfeatures of mill roofs are well defined, yet with regard to roof covering\r\nthere is a wide diversity of experience and opinion.\r\n\r\nThe present form of factory roofing resembles a floor in its construction,\r\nbeing made, in a similar manner, of plank laid upon beams which project\r\nthrough the walls, where they act as a bracket to the cornice, the ends\r\nbeing sawed after any suitable ornamentation. The inclination for such\r\nroofs is about three-fourths of an inch to the foot. Where a mill is\r\nnarrow enough for a single beam to reach from the wall to the ridge, they\r\nform cantilevers, the second point of support from the wall being by the\r\ncolumns one-third of the distance across the mill, and the ends of the\r\nbeams are further secured together by means of iron dogs. For mills of\r\ngreater width, the beam would reach only to the row of columns, and over\r\nthe middle of the mill a beam is placed, usually horizontal on the under\r\nside, and hewn down from the middle to each end, so as to preserve the\r\nsame slope on the upper side of the beam as for the roof.\r\n\r\nIn many instances mills are built with brick cornices, without any of the\r\nwood projection from the side; and in other buildings the walls are\r\ncarried above the roof, which slopes toward the center, and all water\r\nfalling on it or melted from the snow is conducted from it by pipes\r\nleading down through the middle of the mill.\r\n\r\nIt is not desirable to place gutters around the edge of the mill, as they\r\nserve no useful purpose, and are in continual need of repairs. By leaving\r\nthe edge of the mill plank square and protecting it by sheet metal\r\nflashing, the rain falling from the roof can be received by a concave walk\r\nof coal tar concrete placed on the ground around the building. Suitable\r\nporches over doors, or some guard on the roof at these points, will\r\nprevent people who may be passing in at doors from being unduly wet by\r\nwater from the roof.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous forms of roof coverings, the use of the different\r\nvarieties being to a great extent local; that is, the sheet iron coverings\r\nused in the Middle States are almost unknown in New England; and in the\r\nlatter place the ordinary tinned iron roofing is universally painted,\r\nwhile in the Dominion of Canada it is laid obliquely and never painted.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded by all that sheet copper forms the most desirable method of\r\ncovering a roof; and, if one could be assured of the permanence of the\r\nstructure, irrespective of the necessity for making changes every half\r\nyear in order to keep pace with the march of invention, it would doubtless\r\nbe shown that under such conditions of permanency copper would form the\r\ncheapest roof.\r\n\r\nThe most widely used roofing materials for this class of buildings are the\r\nasphalt and the coal tar roof, the latter being the most widely used in\r\nNew England. There are numerous varieties of these composition coverings,\r\nwhich are applied by various methods. Some of these are of the most\r\nsatisfactory character, while others are poorly designed and unskillfully\r\napplied, and are a constant source of trouble and expense to the occupant\r\nof the building.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading manufacturers, the efficiency of whose work for many\r\nyears over a large amount of mill property I can vouch for by personal\r\nknowledge, uses the following method of applying the roofing. Three layers\r\nof roofing felt are placed on the plank parallel to the eaves, and\r\ncontinued by lapping each additional layer two thirds of its width upon\r\nthe preceding one, and in this manner covering the roof with three\r\nthicknesses of the felt, breaking joints. This is secured to the roof by\r\nnails through tin washers and coated with a melted composition, and then\r\ntwo additional layers of felt are placed over the whole. Another coat of\r\ncomposition is then applied and gravel is placed over the whole while\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\nThis maker does not approve of the practice of cementing each sheet of\r\nfelt when it is laid, because it does not allow the felt freedom to yield\r\nfrom the expansion and contraction of the roof. When tin is applied to\r\nroofs, resin-sized building paper should first be laid on the roof plank,\r\nand the sheets of tin should be painted on the lower side before being\r\nlaid.\r\n\r\nOf late years cotton duck has been applied as a roof covering, and has\r\nbeen watched with a great deal of anticipation, although it has been used\r\nfor similar purposes in covering ships' decks for many years. But the two\r\nuses are not strictly comparable, because the ship's deck is calked tight,\r\nand therefore the covering is free from the application of moisture\r\nunderneath, while the roof is never tight, and the warm air underneath,\r\nheavily charged with moisture, which permeates the cracks between the\r\nplanks, becomes chilled and condenses as it nears the top, carrying on a\r\nprocess of distillation.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the extent to which this can be carried on, I have known\r\nof instances where people presumed they were making a good roof by leaving\r\nslight air spaces by means of the furring laid between the roof plank and\r\nthe top boarding. The circulation of air in these spaces deposited\r\nsufficient moisture to rot the boards.\r\n\r\nA mill manager, wishing to have a roof over a very warm room, which should\r\nbe both tight and a very perfect non-conductor, made a roof containing a\r\nspace of about sixteen inches, which was filled with sawdust, and the roof\r\nboarding on top of this was covered with tar and gravel in the usual\r\nmanner. In a few weeks the water began to drip through the ceiling as if\r\nthe roof was leaking, although there was no snow on the top of the roof.\r\nInvestigation showed that within that short time a sufficient amount of\r\nwater had condensed with the sawdust to saturate the whole.\r\n\r\nI would say in this connection that three inches of plank afford an ample\r\nprotection against condensation over any ordinary process of manufacture,\r\nalthough four inches of plank have been used as a roof over paper machines\r\nin order to be safe beyond peradventure; but it is necessary that nails\r\nshould not be driven into the bottom of this roof plank, because the point\r\nof a nail will reach to a lower temperature near the outside of the roof\r\nin the winter, and being a better conductor, it will cause moisture to\r\ncondense upon the head of the nail.\r\n\r\nTin roofing is so general in use as not to require any allusion to methods\r\nof application, but the only course to reach economical and satisfactory\r\nresults for a term of years, especially for locations near to the sea\r\nshore, is to use the best quality of dipped roofing plates of some brand\r\nwhich can be relied on as conforming to the standard and free from\r\n\"wasters\" or imperfect plates.\r\n\r\nDuck roofing has been successfully applied by first laying and tacking\r\ndown a covering of two-ply asphalt paper, and upon this was spread a\r\ncovering of resin-sized sheathing paper, tacked in the usual manner. Upon\r\nthis was laid a covering consisting of cotton duck, forty-four inches wide\r\nand weighing twenty-six ounces to the yard. Several methods of joining the\r\nedges of the duck together have been tried, resulting in the abandonment\r\nof the method of sewing used, for the preferable method of nailing the\r\nduck down, laying one strip over the other, and then opening the duck, a\r\nlock joint is formed without any jointure between the two sheets exposed\r\nto the weather. After the duck is stretched on the roof, it is securely\r\nfastened by means of round-headed woodscrews, one and one-fourth inches\r\nlong, through a concave tin washer three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\nresting upon a seven-eighths of an inch washer made of roofing felt.\r\n\r\nA coat of hot pine tar with a small quantity of linseed oil is laid upon\r\nthe whole of the duck roofing, after being laid, for the purpose of\r\nfilling the fiber and preserving the cotton fabric by means of the\r\nantiseptic principles of the pine tar. The surface is then covered with\r\ntwo coats of mineral paint.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, paper has been very successfully used as a roof covering.\r\nSheets of wood pulp board about one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness are\r\ntreated by a process which renders them hard and elastic, and secured upon\r\nthe roof by means of tacks through concave tin washers. The edge of each\r\nsheet is grooved, in order to allow for the expansion and contraction of\r\nthe roof. The whole roof is then covered with a heavy mineral paint.\r\nExperience with this during the past severe winter in Maine has been of\r\nthe most satisfactory nature.\r\n\r\nShingles furnish a much better roof covering than slate, both in the\r\nmatter of conduction of heat or cold in the extremes of summer and winter\r\nand also in resistance to fire. The heat of a slight fire underneath the\r\nroof will cause slates to crumble; and the same result will be obtained by\r\nheavy sparks falling and burning upon the roof. Some people treat shingles\r\nby boiling them under pressure in a solution of salt and chloride of lime,\r\nfor the purpose of antiseptic treatment and also to render them fireproof.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              STOREHOUSES.\r\n\r\nThe latest form of storehouses tends to one of two extremes. Where land is\r\nnearly level, and cheap, the greatest storage capacity can be obtained\r\nwith the greatest economy by means of a one or two story storehouse built\r\nwith a plank construction, with the beams secured to the posts by means of\r\nknees. A traveling crane or railroad runs along the middle of the\r\nstorehouse, affording a ready means for rapid changes of the contents of\r\nthe storehouse.\r\n\r\nAnother form for storage is by means of very large brick buildings,\r\nespecially arranged as a protection against outside fire. In designing a\r\nstorehouse it is of especial importance that the stories should not be\r\nmade so high that it will be possible for a dangerous load to be piled\r\nupon any one floor.\r\n\r\nThe wool storehouse of the Pacific Mills at Lawrence can be safely said to\r\nbe in its design and construction the finest example of mill engineering\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nAnother type of mill storehouse, designed for both raw material and\r\nfinished goods, is designed by Mr. John Kilburn, of Lowell, and consists\r\nof two buildings placed at right angles to each other, and joining only\r\nat one corner. These buildings do not contain openings through the floors\r\nof any nature whatsoever, either for stairways, elevators, or any other\r\npurpose; but all vertical communication is furnished by means of a masonry\r\ntower at one corner of the buildings, which contains an elevator and\r\nstairway. At the level of each floor, substantial balconies lead through a\r\ndoorway in the tower to one in the storehouse, and the storage is added to\r\nor withdrawn from the storehouse in this manner.\r\n\r\nI have not made any reference to the use of rolled iron for structural\r\npurposes, because such material has not been used to any extent in mill\r\narchitecture. Irrespective of questions of space or of strength, wood\r\nbeams possess advantages in the reduction of vibration, facility of\r\nsecuring the plank above and hangers below, and a great many other\r\npurposes in the changing and alterations of a mill, which render them\r\npeculiarly useful, and I believe that the results with Southern pine beams\r\nin American mills are much superior to those of the iron beams in European\r\nmills.\r\n\r\nNo small part of the success attending the use of rolled iron in the\r\nstructural purposes for which it is adapted, has been due to the excellent\r\nand reliable engineering information contained in the manuals and\r\ncatalogues issued by the rolling mills. Such works are reliable and clear,\r\nand, as far as I know, can without exception be safely followed.\r\n\r\nThe general tendency of American mill construction is toward as low\r\nbuildings as the price of land will admit. The American mills being\r\ndevoted to a large variety of operations, instead of being confined to a\r\nsingle process after the manner of those of European type, require a great\r\ndeal more care in their organization, not merely in the original lay-out\r\nfor the purpose of arranging for the passage of the stock in processes\r\nfrom the raw material to the finished product in as straight lines as\r\npossible, but due consideration should also be given to providing\r\nfacilities for the enlargement of the mill.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the methods employed, in a paper mill plan of my own\r\ndesign, [the view and plan being thrown on the screen], the various\r\noperations containing processes of different hazard in regard to fire are\r\ncompletely isolated from each other by means of fire walls, and the\r\nstorage of the mill is in turn isolated from the manufactory.\r\n\r\nThe storehouse consists of three sections, the largest section for paper\r\nstock, which is sorted in the upper story, the second section, one story\r\nin height, for other manufacturing supplies, and beyond the fire wall the\r\nstorehouse is arranged to contain the finished paper. Goods can be taken\r\naway from or added to the storehouse at the single line of teams, or\r\nrailroad siding.\r\n\r\nAfter the stock leaves the sorting room, it is carried to the dusting room\r\nover a covered bridge, which is protected from the weather on one side,\r\nyet does not form a flue for the spread of fire as does a closed bridge.\r\n\r\nThe first room in the main mill is used for a dusting room, and thence the\r\nstock falls into the rotary bleach, whence it is carried through the fire\r\ndoors to the engine room. Here it meets the wood pulp and clay wheeled\r\nfrom the middle section of the storehouse, which is on that same level.\r\nAfter washing and beating, the stock is run into the drainers below,\r\nwhence it is raised again, and after suitable intermediate processes the\r\npulp is converted into paper on the paper machine in the connecting\r\nbuilding. This paper is then taken into the upper part of the main\r\nbuilding, and after being dried on the lofts is suitably calendered and\r\npacked before being transferred into the extreme end of the storehouse to\r\nawait shipment.\r\n\r\nAt the present time it has been found that an inclined roof of the olden\r\ntype is not a necessity over a paper machine, as has been decreed by the\r\ntradition passed down from old practices. Within the last year, a number\r\nof flat roofs have been placed over paper machines, without any trouble\r\nensuing from condensed water forming on the ceiling and thence dropping\r\nupon the stock. It is well known that the use of a flat roof in such\r\nplaces is attended with a great many mechanical conveniences; and the\r\npitched roof hitherto used for these purposes has been submitted to, only\r\nbecause it was presumed to be necessary. The whole tendency of mill design\r\nis in the line of fitness of means to ends, in the simplest and most\r\ndirect manner.\r\n\r\nWhen the mills in Lowell were first built, they consisted of isolated\r\nbuildings, which it was presumed would remain for all time; but when it\r\nbecame necessary to increase the plant, it was found that the engineer had\r\nwisely laid out the mills in the same yard in reference to a fixed grade,\r\nso that corresponding floors would meet when the buildings were extended\r\nso that they reached each other.\r\n\r\nWherever a strong and diffused light is necessary for any manufacturing\r\nprocess, or the conditions are such as to require unusual stability of the\r\nbuilding, one-story mills lighted by monitors afford accommodations not\r\nreached by any other form of construction.\r\n\r\nIn presenting before you some of the salient features of modern mill\r\nconstruction, I have endeavored to show the various steps of progress\r\nleading up to the development of the present types of design, as well as\r\nsome of the methods of construction in present use.\r\n\r\nThese various steps in advance, producing mills better suited for the\r\npurposes for which a mill is built, are not generally due to elements\r\noriginating with the manufacturers, but with the Factory Mutual\r\nUnderwriters, who, finding it cheaper to prevent a fire than to settle a\r\nloss, have in every manner encouraged improvements in construction,\r\nequipment, and administration, with the result of diminishing the\r\ninsurance on textile manufacturing property during the last generation\r\nfrom two and one-half down to one-fourth of one per cent., or reducing the\r\ncost of insurance eighty per cent.\r\n\r\nIn designing any work, a careful regard should be given to precedents,\r\nremembering that a good designer must also be a good copyist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PASSIVE STATE OF IRON AND NICKEL.--E. Saint Edme.--The nickel of\r\ncommerce immediately becomes passive if immersed in ordinary nitric acid.\r\nIron, while being briskly attacked by common nitric acid, is rendered\r\npassive by contact with nickel. If steel and nickel are plunged into the\r\nacid together, the former metal is not even momentarily attacked. Nickel\r\nretains energetically a proportion of combined nitrogen, to which its\r\npassivity is due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        IMPROVED TORPEDO BOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe give an illustration of the new type of second class torpedo boat which\r\nMessrs. Yarrow & Co. have recently constructed to the order of the\r\nAdmiralty, and which was tried at the latter part of last year. The boat\r\nis 60 ft. long over all and 8 ft. 6 in. wide, 3 ft. shorter and from a\r\nfoot to 15 in. wider than the old type of second class boats. She attained\r\na speed of rather more than 17 knots per hour on her official trial with 4\r\ntons on board. The speed, when light, for six runs on the measured mile\r\nwas 18-1/2 knots. The latter seems a very high speed for so small a vessel,\r\nand indeed it is a remarkable performance, but at the same time the speed\r\nof 17.031 knots on a four hours' trial with 4 tons on board is more\r\nremarkable still. It is well to note, says _Engineering_, in comparing\r\nspeeds of torpedo boats, under what conditions as to weight carried and\r\nduration of running the trial is made. In our previous notice we referred\r\nto the manner in which this boat differs from ordinary second class boats\r\nin the manner of ejecting the torpedo; and the arrangement is well shown\r\nin the engraving. The more ordinary method of firing the torpedo from a\r\ntube or tubes, built into the hull and pointing forward through the bow,\r\nwill be familiar to the majority of our readers; but here it will be seen\r\nthe bow fire has been altogether abandoned, and a swiveling gun placed aft\r\nis substituted. The gun, of course, is not new; indeed, one was placed on\r\nthe old Lightning, the first torpedo boat built for the English navy. That\r\nvessel was, however, a first class boat, and although not so large as the\r\nfirst class boats now built, was considerably bigger than No. 50, which is\r\nthe official designation of the craft under notice. In the Lightning, too,\r\nthe torpedo gun was placed forward, and was trained in quite a different\r\nmanner to that of this second class boat. We have already commented on the\r\noffensive advantages of being able to eject the torpedo through a wide\r\nangle of range, and when going at speed, rather than having to bring the\r\nboat to a stop and fire only end on. We need not therefore recur to this\r\npoint; but since our former notice appeared we have had, while on shore,\r\nan opportunity of seeing the boat steam at speed and maneuver. Our\r\nprevious experience was obtained on board--a position which, in some\r\nrespects, does not afford so good a point of observation as when one is at\r\nsome little distance from the boat. It is certainly a remarkable sight to\r\nsee the manner in which this little vessel winds among craft or round\r\nbuoys, or turns circles of surprisingly small diameter. She seems to pivot\r\non a point very near the bow, a fact which is no doubt chiefly to be\r\naccounted for by the way the deadwood is cut away aft. This allows the\r\nstream of water diverted by the unusually large rudder to swing the after\r\npart round with facility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED TORPEDO BOAT.]\r\n\r\nAnother notable feature about No. 50 is the comparatively small bow wave\r\nshe throws up. We believe it is pretty generally acknowledged now that the\r\nmost noticeable point at night about a torpedo boat traveling at high\r\nspeed--putting on one side flame and sparks from the funnel--is the high\r\nbow wave the majority of these vessels throw up when going quickly through\r\nthe water. The powerful electric search light causes this mass of foaming\r\nwater to show up with peculiar distinctness against the dark background of\r\nsea and sky. It has been, therefore, thought advisable to reduce this\r\nundesirable feature even if something in the shape of speed has to be\r\nsacrificed. Fairly full bow lines are the best for fast boats of this\r\nclass, but in such a model the big bow wave is very noticeable. Messrs.\r\nYarrow have met the demand of naval officers for a less easily observed\r\nboat by placing the greatest cross section further aft than they would\r\nhave done had speed alone been the point aimed at, as it almost always was\r\nin the earlier torpedo boats. It is therefore additionally creditable to\r\nMessrs. Yarrow that they have reached the unprecedentedly high speed of\r\nseventeen knots, with so considerable an addition to the beam, and that\r\nthey have at the same time reduced the bow wave.\r\n\r\nThere is a further advantage of less surface disturbance when running\r\ntorpedo boats. It is unnecessary to point out that surprise will be the\r\nchief element of success in future possible attacks in which these craft\r\nmay be engaged. As the bow wave is most likely to reveal the presence of\r\nthe boat by sight, so also will it most probably give first warning of\r\napproach by sound. It is the splash of the water and not the noise of the\r\nmachinery that can be heard for the greatest distance when a boat is\r\nrunning with hatches closed--speaking of course of high-speed boats in\r\nwhich the engines are kept to a high degree of perfection, as they should\r\nbe, and in the Royal Navy are, with all torpedo boats. It will therefore\r\nbe seen that there is an additional reason for reducing the objectionable\r\nbow wave.\r\n\r\nThe boat which we illustrate recently made the run from the Thames to\r\nPortsmouth, and, the weather being bad, was taken through the somewhat\r\nintricate but more sheltered fairways and channels of what is known as the\r\n\"overland passage.\" Off Margate she managed to get on the ground--a result\r\nby no means to be wondered at; and, as the sands here are very hard, she\r\nsmashed her propeller. After a time she was got off and beached, when a\r\nnew propeller was fitted. We mention this incident, as it is generally\r\nsupposed that these craft are of a very fragile description; \"egg shell\"\r\nis the favorite term of comparison. One distinguished naval\r\nofficer--retired--has said he would never willingly go on board these\r\ncraft, for fear of putting his foot through the bottom; and there is a\r\nvery funny story extant about a sailor with a wooden leg. It would seem,\r\nhowever, from the experience of No. 50, that steel vessels are of much\r\nmore robust constitution than is generally supposed, and, indeed, there is\r\nample testimony to the fact. We recently witnessed the efforts of a small\r\nworking party to get one of these vessels over a bank. She was pushed as\r\nhigh up as the strength of the party would allow, and in this position her\r\nfore part was over the bank for about a third of the length of the boat. A\r\ntackle was then put on the bow, which was bowsed down until the boat could\r\nbe dragged straight ahead.\r\n\r\nA few words may appropriately be added here as to torpedo boat policy\r\ngenerally. Admiral Colomb, in the opening remarks of his excellent little\r\nmanual, \"The Naval Year Book,\" refers to the torpedo boat question in the\r\nfollowing terms: \"The fleet, the flotilla, the cruiser, and the harbor\r\nattack and defense have each had (_i. e._, during the past year) their\r\nshare of attention, and developed exercise, and opinion has been advanced,\r\nguided, or turned back by the observation of facts which these exercises\r\nhave brought out. While it cannot, perhaps, be said that the torpedo, as\r\ntorpedo, has much altered its position in naval estimation, it seems fair\r\nto assume that the torpedo boat, as boat, has fallen in repute. In the\r\nfirst, it has grown very much larger, and has, in point of fact, ceased to\r\nbe a boat. In part this may have come about because the _role_ which some\r\nproposed for the torpedo boat, of being an entirely defensive weapon\r\nconfined to territorial localities, and operating only within a short\r\ndistance from its port, has never been generally accepted. Boats which\r\nwere never intended for voyages have been sent on voyages, and, being\r\nfound more or less unsuited for that kind of service, supposed\r\nimprovements have been made, so that they should be capable of executing\r\nit. The 'harbor defense' instrument has become a 'sea attack' instrument,\r\nand in some sense an unrecognized rival to the undoubted sea-going torpedo\r\nvessels like the Archer, the Fearless, and the Rattlesnake.\"\r\n\r\nIn these passages Admiral Colomb has put the present aspect of the torpedo\r\nboat question very aptly. We are now experiencing the inevitable reaction\r\nconsequent upon our early over-valuing of the torpedo. The unknown\r\npossibilities for distinction of those weapons were so magnified that\r\nscarcely any expenditure was thought too great to provide means for their\r\nemployment, both in and out of season. Torpedo vessels have been growing\r\nin size and costliness. More and more gear has been crowded into them,\r\nincreasing their weight and cost, and also the intricacy of their\r\nmachinery. In all this, cheapness, the one great virtue of the torpedo,\r\nhas been overshadowed. No doubt it is right for a great naval power like\r\nGreat Britain to have vessels of all classes, and the possible value of\r\nsmall fast vessels such as the Archer or the Rattlesnake--not necessarily\r\nas connected with the torpedo--can hardly be overestimated. But for\r\nsmaller naval powers, that look on the torpedo boat as a means of coast\r\ndefense, especially those countries having a broken coast line studded\r\nwith islands, bays, and inlets, it is very questionable whether the\r\nsmaller boats, such as that now under notice, will not be a better\r\ninvestment than the larger craft at present more in vogue. By the\r\nadditional seaworthiness of this boat, secured chiefly by the increased\r\nwidth, the 60 ft., or second class, boat has been lifted into the category\r\nof practicable vessels; and it must be remembered that four or five of\r\nthese smaller craft can be purchased for the price of one modern first\r\nclass boat. This is the crucial point, the money standard, and it is to\r\nthat that all ship and boat building questions must be reduced, whether\r\nit be in wealthy England or the most impecunious and perhaps hardly more\r\nthan half-civilized state.\r\n\r\nThe question may be argued from many points of view, and we put forward\r\nthese remarks simply as suggestions, without any wish to dogmatize. But it\r\nseems that, as the cheaper second class boat has been carried so many\r\nsteps in advance, it may be worth while to reconsider the position with a\r\nview to returning to the original torpedo boat idea of small, inexpensive\r\nvessels, acting by surprise; and not putting too many eggs in one basket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     SCIENTIFIC APPARATUS AT THE MANCHESTER ROYAL JUBILEE EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sine and Tangent Galvanometer._--An exhibit of original scientific\r\napparatus was contributed by Prof. G. F. Fitzgerald, of Trinity College,\r\nDublin. The first instrument was a sine and tangent galvanometer, which\r\ncombines both instruments, and has four interesting peculiarities: (1) The\r\nwindings of the coils are visible through the plate glass sides, so as to\r\nbe capable of easy measurement _in situ_. (2) The position of the needle\r\nis read by reflections of a cylindrical scale in two rectangular mirrors\r\nwhose intersection is horizontal, and which are attached to the magnet.\r\nThese mirrors reflect images of opposite sides of the scale to a fixed\r\nmirror which reflects them into a microscope, in which, by means of a\r\nmicrometer, it is possible to read accurately the position of the line\r\nwhich is the same in the two images. (3) This cylindrical scale is affixed\r\nto the base of the instrument, and the coils can be rotated round it, so\r\nthat when the instrument is used as a sine galvanometer its position is\r\nread by reflection in the rectangular mirrors attached to the magnet of a\r\npointer attached to the coils. (4) By a slight modification of the\r\nsuspension, a beam of light can be reflected from a mirror connected to\r\nthe magnet at 45 deg. to its axis of rotation, and can emerge through the\r\nplate glass side of the instrument and fall on a horizontal scale, where\r\nit will measure the tangent of the deviation instead of the tangent of\r\ntwice the deviation, as in ordinary reflecting galvanometers.\r\n\r\nThe meldometer shown is an instrument for facilitating the identification\r\nof small quantities of minerals by comparative observations on their\r\nmelting points, and for observing the phenomena of their fusion and\r\nebullition. It consists of a strip of platinum arranged to traverse the\r\nstage of a microscope, and heated by a current derived from two Grove's\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nOn this strip the fragments of the mineral, or, if for comparative\r\nobservation, of two or more minerals, are placed. The temperature of the\r\nplatinum is then raised by gradually diminishing a resistance placed in\r\ncircuit with the battery and meldometer, the behavior of the substance\r\nbeing meanwhile observed through the microscope. To effect the elevation\r\nof a temperature automatically, a resistance, consisting of a rod of\r\ncarbon fitted in a vertical glass tube, is employed. Professor Fitzgerald\r\nshowed two sets of apparatus for measuring the densities of gases. Both\r\nmethods depend on the determination of the amount by which a body is\r\nbuoyed up when immersed in the gas.\r\n\r\n_Model for Illustrating the Properties of the Ether._--A very interesting\r\nexhibit was the model for illustrating the electromagnetic and\r\nluminiferous properties of the ether, of which a detailed description is\r\nalmost necessary. The model consists of a series of wheels, rotating on\r\naxes fixed perpendicularly in a plane board, and connected together by\r\nIndia-rubber bands. The axes are fixed at the intersections of two systems\r\nof perpendicular lines, and each wheel is connected with each of its four\r\nneighbors by an India-rubber band. Thus all the wheels can rotate without\r\nany consequent straining of the system if they all rotate at the same\r\nrate. If, however, some of the wheels are rotated through a different\r\nangle from others, the India-rubber bands will be strained. If it be\r\ndesired to represent a region in which conducting matter exists, it will\r\nbe represented by removing the bands from a set of wheels. Suppose the\r\nbands are removed from the regions, A and B, and from the connecting line,\r\nA B, then we can represent the charging of these regions with opposite\r\nelectricities by introducing some mechanism by means of which the wheels\r\non opposite sides of the line, A B, can be rotated in opposite directions.\r\nThe model is not intended to illustrate in any way the connection between\r\nthe ether and matter; indeed, one of the advantages claimed for the model\r\nis, that the study of it so distinctly emphasizes the distinction between\r\nthe phenomena depending on the general properties of the ether by itself\r\nand those depending on its connection with matter. For instance, from the\r\nvery case we have just considered, we get impressed upon us that it is by\r\nmeans of matter only that we can get a hold on the ether so as to strain\r\nit. As the object is not to illustrate the connection between matter and\r\nether, any rough method of turning the wheels so as to create the proper\r\nstrain will do well enough, as it is not the method of producing, but the\r\nnature of the strain produced that is to be considered. Having once\r\nrotated these wheels, we may replace the bands along the line, A B, and we\r\nhave the state of the ether between two oppositely electrified bodies\r\nrepresented on the model.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that half the India-rubber bands are strained, and\r\nthat in lines running round the bodies the tight side of a band is always\r\naway from one body and next the other. This represents the polarization of\r\nthe ether. The late Prof. Clerk-Maxwell defined polarization as a state in\r\nwhich the opposite sides of each element are in opposite states. Now, the\r\nopposite sides of each band are in opposite states--one side loose, the\r\nother tight; and so it can very well represent the polarized state of the\r\nether. The displacement producing the polarization is due to the different\r\nrotation of the wheels carrying the band causing more of the band to be at\r\none side of the wheels than at the other--less at the tight and more at\r\nthe loose side of the pair of wheels, and this represents the electric\r\ndisplacement producing the polarization. The direction of this\r\ndisplacement is at right angles to the line of the bands that are\r\nstrained, and is out from one body and in toward the other all round.\r\n\r\nConsidering the other properties of the ether that are represented by the\r\nmodel, we observe in the first place that during the time polarization is\r\ntaking place the wheels are rotating, and that the rate of rotation of the\r\nwheels is proportional to the rate of increase of polarization, and that\r\nthe direction of the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the direction of\r\nthe displacement. Hence it is seen that the magnetic force is properly\r\nrepresented by the rate of rotation of the wheels, and its direction by\r\nthe axis of rotation. The model, although simple in construction, is very\r\nuseful, and its careful study will greatly assist the student in obtaining\r\ndefinite physical conceptions of many of the more abstruse phenomena\r\ndepending on the ether.\r\n\r\n_Prismatic Photometers._--Another exhibit was a photometer made of solid\r\nparaffin, or any other translucent substance, invented by Mr. J. Joly, of\r\nthe University of Dublin. The arrangement is at once simple and effective.\r\nThe instrument depends upon the fact that if a prism be cut from a\r\ntranslucent body, and so exposed to a source of light that one only of its\r\nfaces is illuminated, the light diffused through the substance and\r\nreflected out through the illuminated faces of the prism gives it an\r\nappearance as if lighted up internally. The effect is, in fact, as if the\r\nprism itself was a source of light. Two such prisms laid together on\r\nsmooth faces, and receiving light from separate sources, if placed so as\r\nto be at opposite sides of the plane of division, appear as if each was\r\nemitting light proportional in intensity to the source of its supply. The\r\ndouble prism has the appearance of two luminous bodies laid side by side.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the supply to each prism is brought to equality, they\r\nappear as if emitting equal quantities of light; and it is hard to detect\r\nany longer that two prisms are being observed, so completely does all\r\ntrace of the plane of division disappear. An ingenious piece of apparatus\r\ninvented by Mr. Joly was one for carrying out his method of determining\r\nthe specific gravity of small quantities of dense or porous bodies. The\r\nmethod here shown enables the specific gravity to be determined whatever\r\nthe density or state of aggregation of the substances, and in extremely\r\nminute quantities, with an accuracy limited only by the sensitiveness of\r\nthe chemical balance.\r\n\r\n_Telegraphing the Readings of Scientific Instruments._--Another invention\r\nof Mr. Joly was his apparatus for obtaining telegraphically the readings\r\nof meteorological instruments placed at a distance from the observer. This\r\napparatus may be attached or adapted to the various thermometers, the\r\nbarometer, rain gauge, and to other instruments placed in a mountain\r\nstation, thus enabling their readings to be taken from a conveniently\r\nplaced observatory. Any number of instruments may be worked with perfect\r\nreliability and certainty by the use of three wires only; the only extra\r\npiece of apparatus needed being a disk, carrying insulated contact pieces\r\narranged round its circumference, to which the wires of the different\r\ninstruments are attached. Of these three wires, one serves to put one\r\nafter the other of the contacts into circuit with the home station through\r\nthe second wire. By this second wire the readings are taken and the\r\nreadjustment of the instruments effected. The third wire is for the\r\nindication of the contacts, and is taken from all the instruments to the\r\ngalvanometer in the home station.--_Industries._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         COLORED PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout nine months since we directed attention to the system of colored\r\nphotography invented by Mr. J. E. Mayall, London. Since that time, Mr.\r\nMayall has further developed the details of his process, and as a result\r\nhis color pictures have been much improved both as regards appearance and\r\nsize, and are beautiful specimens of this new departure in photographic\r\nart. As stated in our previous notice, Mr. Mayall, after fourteen years of\r\nexperimental research, has discovered the art of reproducing the colors\r\nlatent in the negative of the photograph, having arrived at his discovery\r\nby the aid of spectrum analysis, which led him to the conclusion that\r\nevery color in the organic world, when exposed to a suitable photographic\r\nplane in a camera, registers exact vibrations. Mr. Mayall has succeeded in\r\nproducing chemical colors extremely attenuated, which exactly correspond\r\nwith the vibrations in the negative. In doing this, he keeps the film\r\nalive to the smallest vibrations of light. He uses, first, lactate of iron\r\nto impregnate the isinglass film with a salt of iron capable of uniting\r\nwith any stronger organic acid; and, secondly, meconic acid, which\r\nimpregnates the film of albumen, and has a stronger affinity for iron than\r\nlactic acid. It unites with the iron, and forms a red film, which is in a\r\nstate to receive all the lower vibrations of the red end of the spectrum,\r\nand this gives these lower vibrations a fair chance with the electric\r\nlight. All subsequent processes assist this chemical march to the final\r\nend of making a print that will take up colors, which, when added, fall in\r\ntheir places, and there remain indelible and unalterable.--_Iron._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR GAS COMPANIES.[4]\r\n\r\n                   By Mr. THOS. WOOD, of Sandusky.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who were in attendance at our Dayton meeting will perhaps recall the\r\nfact that the writer, in a paper read at that time, strongly advocated gas\r\ncompanies taking hold of the electric light business and running the same\r\nin connection with their gas business; you will also recall the fact that\r\nthe writer suggested that gas companies should take up the incandescent\r\nelectric light and fuel gas. Since that time it has been demonstrated by\r\nseveral gas companies in this and other States that the electric arc\r\nsystem can be added with success, financially, to gas companies and with\r\nsatisfaction to their patrons; and the writer derives great pleasure in\r\nhearing of so many companies who have left the narrow and beaten track of\r\nprejudice and are now walking in the broad road of progression.\r\n\r\n[4] A paper read lately before the Ohio Gas Light Association.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to dwell upon arc lighting now only long enough to\r\nstate that, after two years of practical experience with the combination,\r\nour company consider they have taken a right step in adopting it, and that\r\nit is satisfactory in every respect. Other gas companies that have adopted\r\nthe arc system can undoubtedly corroborate this with their experience. I\r\nwould make this paper a continuation of the last one by now taking up the\r\nincandescent electric system and fuel gas question. That both will be\r\nintroduced into every city in the United States before long by some one I\r\nhave not a shadow of a doubt; and why? Simply because they are both\r\ndesirable commodities in domestic economy and hygiene.\r\n\r\nPlease lay aside all prejudice, and I will show you an ideal domestic\r\nburner for illumination purposes. Now, what comprises an ideal burner for\r\ndomestic use? In the first place, such a burner must not blacken our walls\r\nand ceilings, neither must it give off deleterious products of combustion;\r\nit must be a steady light, and not subject to draughts; it must not give\r\nout heat in summer, it must not be possible for inflammable goods to\r\nignite by coming in contact with it; it must be a light that will have no\r\nill effect if by accident the key is left open; it must be a light that\r\nour country cousins cannot blow out, neither must it be one that requires\r\ndangerous matches to ignite it, and lastly, it must be a fairly cheap\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, if you have thrown prejudice to the winds, perhaps you can\r\nrecognize in this ideal burner the incandescent electric light for\r\ndomestic use. Now, if this light is an ideal one, who is going to prevent\r\nits adoption by the public? Gas companies cannot, and if they cannot no\r\none can. So, in my mind, the wisest course to pursue is to admit what we\r\nknow to be true, and proceed at once to supply the demand, increase our\r\nrevenue, push out into the suburbs of our cities, sell it as cheaply as\r\npossible, and don't let others come in and take away what rightly belongs\r\nto you. If there is any money to be made in the business by others, there\r\nis still more in it for us.\r\n\r\nFor store purposes, where the hours of burning are defined, I think it\r\nbetter to abandon the meter system and fix a price per annum or month for\r\neach lamp, taking into consideration the hours of use as a basis for\r\ncharges. For private dwellings this would not be practicable, and we would\r\nhave to resort in this case to meters, or perhaps fix upon a price for\r\nfurnishing the current and have the consumer purchase the bulbs or lamps\r\nwhenever renewals were necessary. In this way economy would cheapen the\r\nlight to the consumer. Any method that will dispense with the meter and\r\nstill be satisfactory will be the one to adopt.\r\n\r\nI cannot understand how some gas companies who have the incandescent\r\nelectric system as a competitor can console themselves with the fact that\r\nit is not injurious to their gas business, even taking it for granted they\r\nare selling as much gas as before its advent. Is this a just reason why\r\nthey should make no effort to secure their old patronage? I think not, for\r\nit is human nature to secure a whole loaf in place of the half, when it is\r\npossible to get it. A gas company's revenues would certainly be increased\r\nby the step, and a dangerous rival would be made profitable.\r\n\r\nI think it is a mistake to think that by and by the people will get back\r\nto gas. Of course some will, just as gas consumers sometimes go back to\r\ncoal oil; but, because a few give it up, don't let us deceive ourselves by\r\nthinking that all will do it eventually, for the incandescent electric\r\nburner is bound to remain wherever it is now in use, and will find its way\r\nto the other places where it is not now in use. \"That is all very well to\r\ntalk about,\" I hear some one say, \"but what are they going to do with our\r\nprior investment?\" To such I would say, push that, too. Cheapen it to its\r\nlowest point and urge its use for power and cook stoves until such time\r\nthat you find yourselves able to supply gas for heating purposes of all\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nWhat difference does it make to a company whether the money expended for\r\nimprovement account be coal gas benches, holders and mains, or dynamos,\r\nboilers, and wire? I fail to see the difference, and if improvements have\r\nto be made in both, so much the better--it shows a healthy demand for both\r\nbranches, and should be promptly provided for.\r\n\r\nIf arc lighting is to be the light on our streets and the incandescent\r\nelectric light for our stores and dwellings, shall we have to draw our\r\nfires from under our gas benches and stop making gas? This, to the writer,\r\nwould be an absurd deduction, for the very reason that in nature's\r\nlaboratory all these elements are placed, and gas would not be one of them\r\nif there were not some important part for it to play in the supplying of\r\nman's wants. It is for us to take the things we find in nature's\r\nlaboratory and select the fittest articles for each special use; and it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that it will be only the fittest that will finally\r\nbe a success. The arc light, so far as the writer has ascertained, has\r\nasserted pretty generally throughout the country its supremacy on our\r\nstreets, and this in spite of all opposition from gas companies--showing\r\nconclusively that it has gained its position by the force of demand for\r\nthe fittest. Incandescent electric light is just as surely finding its\r\nposition and field of usefulness, and in its turn will assert its\r\nsupremacy, and why? Because it has the qualifications called for in the\r\npublic specifications. Some will assert that it is too expensive to come\r\ninto general use, and also that it is not as reliable as gas. The first is\r\nno argument against it, for was not coal gas sold at exorbitant prices in\r\nits early days? It certainly is capable of being cheapened in the future,\r\nas gas has been, and this is one reason why gas companies should enter the\r\nbusiness, as it is in their power to cheapen it.\r\n\r\nAs far as unreliability is concerned, it certainly looks the most serious\r\nobjection; but don't be alarmed on that score, for duplicate machinery or\r\nstorage batteries will eventually overcome this bugbear, and while\r\ndiscussing this subject don't let us forget that the breaking of a main,\r\nthe filling up of a drip, a flood or explosion, or even Jack Frost, has\r\noften caused our customers to think that even gas is not very reliable.\r\n\r\nI cannot understand what prompts gas companies as a rule to prejudice\r\nagainst electric lighting, unless it be they imagine the outcome to be\r\nidle gas mains and cold benches. This I think is all wrong. The largest\r\nunoccupied field to-day is the fuel gas field, and who should step in and\r\nsupply this demand? Could any one do it as well as the present gas\r\ncompanies? We have our mains and services already laid; we have our\r\nholders, meters, and trained labor, most of us have also the necessary\r\nland to spare on which to erect the generators.\r\n\r\nNext to the fuel gas field I think I can see another field nearly as\r\nextensive, and that is the coal oil field.\r\n\r\nPlease imagine the following picture, which is representative of the\r\nwriter's belief of what a gas company will be in the near future; in fact\r\nso near in the future that before our next convention rolls around it will\r\nbe a reality.\r\n\r\nOne set of officers, whose principal qualifications shall be\r\nprogressiveness--their duties to be divided between electric lighting of\r\nall kinds, including electric power, fuel gas for all purposes, including\r\ngas engines; also incandescent lights off fuel gas mains.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what the plant will consist of. One set of mains for fuel\r\ngas, from which our patrons will draw all their fuel, and also light, if\r\nthey wish. Gas engines will be run economically with this gas. One set of\r\nmeters only will be required.\r\n\r\nThere will be no coal gas benches as we have them now, as the method of\r\nmanufacture is too laborious, too expensive and very primitive, not to say\r\nbarbarous--everything now being built on the horizontal plan, requiring\r\nthe greatest possible exertion to both draw a charge and stoke. The\r\ngenerators of the future will be on the cupola style, feeding by\r\ngravitation from the top. Native coals in all probability will be\r\nsufficiently good to make gas of. One portion of the plant will be devoted\r\nto the dynamos and engines for furnishing the electric light. Where the\r\ncoal gas benches now are will be boilers, or perhaps even these will be\r\nunnecessary if gas engines be used. If steam boilers be used, they will be\r\nfired with producer gas, and the holders will become simply pressure\r\nregulators. The revenues of gas companies will be increased fivefold, if\r\nnot more; the consumer will get cheaper fuel, cheaper power, and cheaper\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nNative coal fields will become more valuable, and we will not pay tribute\r\nto other States, as heretofore. The change from illuminating coal gas to\r\nfuel gas will perhaps be a slow one, owing to the conservatism of gas\r\ncompanies and imperfected details; but eventually it will be brought about\r\nin spite of all obstacles. If a company is operated as pictured, it will\r\nfurnish arc lighting, incandescent electric lighting, and electric motors,\r\nfuel gas, incandescent gas lighting, and gas engines.\r\n\r\nGas will be made on a larger scale, with less dirt and nuisance, and\r\nwithout that laboriousness now made necessary. Valves, levers, and push\r\nbuttons will displace scoop, drawing hook, and wheelbarrow, and the\r\nemployees will no longer be known as \"gas house terriers,\" but will become\r\nelevated to a higher plane. The officers of the company will also of\r\nnecessity have to be more active and alert, and the rule of thumb will be\r\nat a discount. Now let us see where the gas man will be who fails to\r\noccupy these new fields of pasture green.\r\n\r\nHe will, of course, go on making coal gas in the old way; he will still\r\nwrestle with stopped stand pipes, steam jet exhausters, naphthaline, etc.,\r\nand worry over how much a bushel of coke weighs. He will try to convince\r\nhis customers that he knows better than they do what they want, and that\r\nanything but his gas is of no account. He will keep on cutting out items\r\nfrom the newspapers whenever he finds it recorded that an electric light\r\nsomewhere failed to flicker.\r\n\r\nHe will still maintain that there is not a company in the country making\r\nanything out of electric lighting, and that it is only a matter of time\r\nwhen some fellow slips into his town and, noting things, works up an arc\r\nlight company, captures the street lighting and some of our friend's best\r\nconsumers. The price of gas is lowered; all kinds of patent gas burners\r\nare invested in to recapture those lost consumers; a fight ensues,\r\nfactions are made in the town, and the arc light company adds an\r\nincandescent plant to the arc light, and captures more of our friend's\r\nconsumers. To cap the climax, another fellow comes along and proposes to\r\nsupply fuel gas to the citizens, gets a franchise, puts in pipes and\r\nservices, and our friend wakes up some fine morning to find that what the\r\nelectric light fellow has left him in the shape of lighting has been\r\ncaptured by the fellow with the fuel gas plant, who puts in the\r\nincandescent gas burners.\r\n\r\nEvidence is cropping up all around us that tends to this change. We find\r\nmanufacturers of fireclay goods now making carbons for electric lighting;\r\nwe also find gas fixture manufacturers now making and selling electric\r\nwires of all kinds, besides other apparatus connected with the electrical\r\nfield. Manufacturers of meters have not yet devised a meter for measuring\r\nelectrical currents, but perhaps it would pay them to devote a portion of\r\ntheir time to studying one out. As far as the present meter business is\r\nconcerned, I think, if this transformation of the gas business is brought\r\nabout, the demand for gas meters would be quadrupled and the use of the\r\nlarger sizes of meters would be made necessary; but if accuracy could be\r\ninsured with a much smaller meter with quicker action, I think it would be\r\nbetter adapted for the purpose. Fuel gas, if it can be manufactured at a\r\nprice at which it could be sold with profit at a lower or as low price as\r\ncoal, would prove a larger field than all the kinds of lighting put\r\ntogether, and is certainly worth our while to investigate thoroughly. The\r\nowners of the smallest houses of our cities would become our patrons, and\r\na small profit per thousand would represent a wide margin when taking into\r\nconsideration the large amount that would be consumed.\r\n\r\nBut is the fuel gas practical, and has there been sufficient progress made\r\nto date to warrant gas companies taking hold of it with any assurance of\r\nsuccess?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, what assurance do we require? Do we want some one to\r\ncome along and guarantee us a profit of 20 per cent. on our investment if\r\nwe enter the field? If so, the patentees of the different processes might\r\njust as well negotiate with the shoe maker as with the gas company. I\r\nthink all the assurance we want in the premises is that with certain\r\napparatus we can get certain results from a ton of coal (the kind of coal\r\nbeing specified), or that from a ton of coal we can get a certain amount\r\nof available deliverable heat units.\r\n\r\nThe balance we should be capable of working out ourselves, such as labor,\r\nleakage, cost of gas at consumers' meters, and such other data that we\r\ncertainly should be more familiar with than any one else.\r\n\r\nOf course, the fuel gas will have to have an odor, and must be delivered\r\nat a proper pressure; and proper appliances for governing supply and\r\ninsuring perfect safety will have to be calculated on. In fact, the gas\r\nman must try to improve on methods adopted, and do his best to hasten the\r\nday when solid fuel in our homes shall be no more--in other words, we have\r\nto take hold of the fuel gas business in its infancy or it will get weaned\r\naway from us.\r\n\r\nMr. McMillin, with others, has given us some figures on fuel gas which\r\nhave been verified by practical tests. For instance, he gives us as his\r\nopinion that a mixed gas is more adapted for all-round purposes than\r\neither coal or water gas alone.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments made we find that from a ton of bituminous coal, making a\r\nmixed gas, we can realize as salable gas 63 or 64 per cent. of the total\r\nheat units in the original ton of coal, or about 17,000,000 heat units,\r\nbesides a residue of heat sufficient to produce the steam for making the\r\nabove amount.\r\n\r\nOf this mixture 20 per cent. is coal gas, made in the ordinary way, which\r\nis the only objectionable feature the writer can see in the process. I am\r\ninclined to think that Mr. McMillin rather strained a point here in order\r\nnot to alarm coal gas men, or else to avoid a too radical change in the\r\napparatus now in vogue for making coal gas.\r\n\r\nBy his statement we find that in water gas, labor and repairs cost but 7\r\ncents per M, while coal gas costs for the same items 15 cents per M. Of\r\ncourse, the proportion of coal gas made by the old method is of more value\r\nin heat units than the water gas made by the new method; but what I wished\r\nto suggest was this, that if the whole process be made in the cupola as\r\nwater gas is now made, whether the result would be the same number, or\r\nnearly so, of heat units in amount of gas made, with a large reduction in\r\nlabor making the coal gas cost no more than the water gas for the item of\r\nlabor repairs. If the mixture can be made in this manner, and I have some\r\nassurance that it can be done successfully, then I think it would pay any\r\ncompany to abandon the use of the present style of gas benches, and use\r\nthe space now occupied by them with more improved apparatus, rather than\r\nuse them at a loss, simply because we have them on hand.\r\n\r\nWe have pictured an ideal burner for our homes in the fore part of this\r\npaper, and I cannot refrain from holding up to your view this ideal fuel,\r\nwhich has no smoke, no dirt, no ashes, and entails on the housewife no\r\nextra labor, can be regulated automatically to one steady temperature, and\r\ndoes not require a workingman, after doing a hard day's work, to come home\r\nand find a ton of coal dumped on the front sidewalk, which has to be\r\nwheeled or carried in before night comes on.\r\n\r\nNow that we have seen an ideal street light, an ideal house light, and an\r\nideal fuel, we will endeavor to show you an ideal gas company; and we\r\ncannot do it in a more concise way than to say that an ideal gas company\r\nis one that keeps all these ideal commodities for sale at a reasonable\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nThis may look visionary on my part to some of you, perhaps all of you;\r\nbut, nevertheless, I feel that this is the place and time to talk over\r\n\"our future prospects,\" and if this paper is the cause of any one\r\ninvestigating the subjects spoken of or bringing forth discussion\r\nregarding the same, I shall feel I have not written in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY TO LIGHTING AND WORKING.[5]\r\n\r\n                        By W. H. PREECE, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n                                LECTURE I.\r\n\r\n\r\nI appear before you to give a short course of two lectures on the\r\napplication of electricity to lighting and working. To-night I shall\r\nconfine my attention entirely to lighting, and if we succeed in getting\r\nthrough our subject, we shall devote ourselves next Wednesday to the\r\napplication of electricity for working tramways, to the transmission of\r\npower for various purposes, and generally to working.\r\n\r\n[5] Two juvenile lectures recently delivered before the Society of Arts,\r\nLondon.--_From the Journal of the Society._\r\n\r\nMany people imagine the electric light to be a cold light. It is a\r\ndelusion. It is called a cold light because in many of its forms it gives\r\nwhat we may call a cheerless light; it has not got the warmth, the\r\ncomfortable look, of other artificial means of illumination.\r\n\r\nThe electric light owes its existence to the intense heat that the\r\nelectric current produces, and heat lies at the root of every system of\r\nartificial illumination. For instance, suppose we take a common match and\r\nlight it, we light it simply because by the friction of the two surfaces\r\ntogether we generate heat, the heat burns the substance of which the match\r\nis made. We are able to light a common candle because we have applied heat\r\nto the wick, the heat liquefies the wax of which the candle is made, the\r\nwax is decomposed, it combines with the oxygen of the air, intense heat is\r\nproduced at that point, carbon is consumed, and the consequence is light.\r\nSo with all our various modes of artificial illumination. Gas, as you are\r\nwell aware, produces intense heat, and the result of that heat is light.\r\nThere are various ways in which gas is applied to produce heat and the\r\nnecessary consequence--light. Here is a Sellon gas burner, in which the\r\ncombustion of gas raises the temperature of a fine platinum cap, and the\r\nresult is, as you see, a very beautiful light. In one lamp we have a cap\r\nor mantle, in the other case there is merely a flat disk gauze of\r\nplatinum. The combustion of the gas produces intense heat, which raises\r\nthe network to a very high state of temperature, though in the present\r\ncase the light is not so good as it should be, probably through the\r\npressure in the supply main not being sufficiently great.\r\n\r\nIn another case we have a gas jet surrounded with a network of some\r\nvegetable matter, linen or cambric, steeped in a solution of salts of\r\nzirconium, and a few other rare earths, and the intense heat of the gas\r\ncauses a very high temperature, and, as you see, a very brilliant effect\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\nYou will see from this that in all cases of artificial illumination bodies\r\nhave to be raised to a high state of temperature. I hold in my hand a\r\npiece of magnesium wire; it is really flat magnesium tape, but it is\r\ncalled wire. If I heat that, you will observe that a very brilliant light\r\nis produced, due to the very high temperature at which it burns. Now, if I\r\ntake a lump of coal and heat it--it requires to be raised to a certain\r\ntemperature before the oxygen is directed upon it--and subject it to a jet\r\nof oxygen, you will see that it burns with very much more intense light\r\nthan you are accustomed to in the ordinary fire. If I take a piece of iron\r\nwire and place it in a jar of oxygen, you see what a very brilliant effect\r\nthe combination of oxygen and iron produces through the iron being raised\r\nto a very high temperature.\r\n\r\nI have now shown you that in order to produce light we must, by some means\r\nor other, raise the temperature of a body. But the high temperature that\r\nwe have to deal with is not that produced by the combination of the oxygen\r\nof the air and carbon, and other bodies such as I have shown you, but it\r\nis produced by the aid of the electric current. In all these cases the\r\nresult of the combustion you have seen has been to remove oxygen from the\r\nair, but now I want to show you how a body can be raised to a high state\r\nof temperature without combustion of any kind. In front of me I have a\r\nfine platinum wire. In my hand I hold a wire that is in connection with a\r\nbattery upstairs, the other wire in connection with the battery is\r\nattached to the far end of the fine platinum wire; now, when I make\r\ncontact with the near end of the platinum wire, you observe that the wire\r\nis raised to redness, its temperature is high, and as I reduce the length\r\nof the platinum wire it gets brighter and brighter, the amount of\r\nelectricity passing through it is greater and greater, and presently the\r\nwire is fused. I should have pointed out that as the quantity of heat\r\ngenerated in a wire increases, so does the color of the light. When heat\r\nis applied to a body, that body is first warmed, then it gets gradually\r\nhotter and hotter, until it becomes red hot, and the first color that\r\nappears is always red. The temperature is further raised, and the body\r\nassumes the color of orange, then at a little higher temperature it\r\nappears yellow, and so the different colors of the rainbow are perceived\r\naccording to the different temperatures to which the body tested with is\r\nraised. Now, I want to show you the most intense form in which heat can be\r\nproduced on this earth. There is no hotter object that we can obtain than\r\nthat of the electric arc. I will try and produce this arc. You observe\r\nthat when I bring these two pieces of carbon together, a current of\r\nelectricity passes between them, and the passage of the current of\r\nelectricity between them creates such an intense temperature that a\r\nbrilliant white light, as you see, is produced. Incandescent particles of\r\ncarbon pass between the two points, forming a sort of bridge or arch,\r\nwhich is called the electric arc. But the temperature of this arc is, as I\r\nsaid before, the highest temperature that we can produce; it has been\r\nmeasured, and is found to be 8,500 deg. Fahr. That is a temperature that can\r\nhardly be conceived; the melting point of iron is only about 1,200 deg. Fahr.;\r\nthe melting point of platinum, which is one of the most refractory metals\r\nwe have, is about 3,000 deg. Fahr.; but here in the arc we have the intense\r\ntemperature that nothing can withstand, equal to 8,500 deg. Fahr. The color is\r\nreally due to the combustion that takes place between the materials\r\nforming the arc. I have just used two pieces of carbon, but I will now try\r\nother materials--copper, iron, and zinc. You will see a difference in the\r\ncolor of the light, due to the fact that metal is burned in the arc\r\ninstead of carbon. Every metal has its own distinct and particular color,\r\nand the presence of the different metals can be detected by the character\r\nof the small arcs produced.\r\n\r\nI have shown you that we have two modes of producing intense heat, and\r\ntherefore light, by electricity. I want now to show you how we produce\r\nelectricity. The first essential for the production of electricity with a\r\nhand machine like this is a good dinner. The energy provided by beef or\r\nmutton enables the operator to turn the big wheel of the machine, whence\r\nmotion is transmitted to the apparatus for producing the electricity. This\r\nmachine when rotated causes a coil of copper wire to be whirled in a\r\nmagnetic field, and that rotation of the coil in a magnetic field converts\r\nthe energy derived from the grass and from the mutton through the machine\r\ninto electric currents; those electric currents flow through wires that\r\nare under the table, they will appear in the two wires I hold in my hand,\r\nand will, I hope, reappear in the little glow-lamps I have before me in\r\nthe shape of heat, and then of light when I attach the wires. The light of\r\nthe glow-lamp is of just the same form of energy as that which passed from\r\nthe sun to the earth, and by beginning backward from the lamps we have\r\nlight, heat, electric currents, mechanical motion, food or fuel in the\r\nshape of mutton, grass on the South Downs, to the sun. Whichever way it is\r\ntaken, you will find there is direct action between the sun and the\r\nglow-lamp. The lamps are now burning, and you see that we are able to\r\nproduce electricity to our hearts' content. Down-stairs there is a\r\ngas-engine; the gas-engine is at work; the gas-engine works because the\r\ngas supplies energy which, stored up in the bowels of the earth in the\r\nform of coal for ages and ages, has been extracted; it has been converted\r\ninto gas at the large gas works down the River Thames, it has been brought\r\nup here, it is burned in the gas-engine, and produces energy in the\r\ngas-engine exactly in the same way as the mutton or beef produced energy\r\njust now. There is a dynamo down-stairs exactly like the dynamo that we\r\nhave upon the platform, and the current that is produced is exactly as the\r\ncurrent we just obtained, and is sending electricity through all the lamps\r\nin this room. The currents of electricity passing through the lamps are\r\nproducing intense heat, the heat is producing the incandescence of a fine\r\ncarbon filament, such as I will show you directly, and the consequence is\r\nthat we are now being lighted in this room by the energy that unmistakably\r\nand undisputably arrived on this earth millions of years ago in the form\r\nof sunshine.\r\n\r\nWe can store up the energy in batteries. I shall show you to-night two or\r\nthree different forms of battery. Here is what is called a primary\r\nbattery. The only difference between a primary battery and a secondary\r\nbattery is this, that a primary battery consists of chemical elements that\r\nat once combine and produce electricity by combustion, whereas a secondary\r\nbattery involves some anterior electrical action, which prepares the\r\nsurfaces of two bodies to put them in exactly the same condition as a\r\nprimary battery. Here is a primary battery known as the Schanschieff,\r\nwhich is charged with a solution of sulphate of mercury, and into that\r\nsulphate of mercury we will dip plates of zinc and plates of carbon. Zinc\r\nhas a greater affinity for the sulphuric acid of the sulphate of mercury\r\nthan mercury has; the sulphuric acid will at once combine with the zinc;\r\nit will burn the zinc just as the gas burned just now, but instead of\r\nburning with heat and light in the battery, it burns in the form of\r\nelectricity, which appears in the glow-lamps attached. You see that the\r\nmoment the zinc and carbons are placed in the cell electricity is\r\nproduced, and the lamp is lighted. The form of battery from which we are\r\ndrawing our electricity to-night is the accumulator, or the storage or\r\nsecondary battery. The secondary battery simply consists of plates or\r\n\"grids,\" as they are called, one filled with litharge, and the other with\r\nred lead; the one becomes pure lead, the other becomes peroxide of lead;\r\nthe plates are combined in this form, and then placed in a glass cell, and\r\nupstairs there are 52 of these E.P.S. cells, which have been charged all\r\nday long by the gas-engine of which I spoke, and which now contain a store\r\nof electricity that I shall make considerable use of to-night before I\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\nI showed you the form of electric light which we call the arc, and I have\r\nhere to-night two or three different forms of arc lamps, which I will show\r\nin action. But I want you to see this arc light for yourselves, and I want\r\nyou to feel, as I feel, that in all nature there is nothing more wonderful\r\nand nothing more beautiful than the action of electric currents in the\r\narc. The light is, as I attempted to show you, the very same light that\r\ncame from the sun. I can show you that it is of the same character as the\r\nlight of the sun, and in the lantern on the table there is an arc lamp the\r\nlight of which we will throw on the paper before me in the form of a\r\nspectrum. There you see the spectrum in all its purity; the spectrum from\r\nthe sun is no purer as regards light than what you now see. There you see\r\nall the colors of the rainbow, and I had intended, if it were possible, to\r\nshow you in the first experiment, in which we raised platinum wire to\r\nincandescence, that the first color would be the red, then the orange,\r\nthen the yellow, then the green, then the blue, then the indigo, and\r\nlastly the violet. Beyond the violet there are rays of light which we\r\ncannot see; they are the rays that produce the photographic pictures, and,\r\nhad time permitted it, we would probably have taken to-night a picture by\r\nmeans of the arc lamps, but it requires a long time to do so, and it\r\nreally is no more interesting than an ordinary photographic picture. There\r\nare all the different colors of the rainbow. Those who are anxious to\r\nremember the order of the colors can very easily do so if they will\r\nremember this simple sentence, \"Read over your good book in verse.\" The\r\nfirst letter of each word in that sentence gives the first letter of the\r\ncolor in the order of the spectrum. It would be a very good thing if some\r\nof our artists were to study and remember the colors of the rainbow, for\r\nit is an extremely rare thing indeed to find a picture with the colors of\r\nthe rainbow properly depicted, sometimes they are upside down, sometimes\r\nthey are mixed, and if you discuss the fact with an artist, he will say,\r\n\"I do not care about your science. I simply paint my own impressions.\"\r\n\r\nI will now show you the arc in another form. We are to-night connected in\r\nthis room--I have told you there is a gas-engine down-stairs; there are\r\nalso secondary batteries upstairs--but we are in connection with the\r\nGrosvenor Gallery in Bond Street. The Grosvenor Gallery has a central\r\nstation where a very large dynamo is at work, from which electricity is\r\nsupplied to different parts of London; many thousand lamps are fed, in a\r\ngreat many clubs, theaters, and private houses; they are all lit up by the\r\ncurrents generated underneath the Grosvenor Gallery. The Grosvenor Gallery\r\nCompany, through their engineer, Mr. Ferranti, have very kindly undertaken\r\nto supply us to-night with a current. The current is supposed to be a very\r\ndangerous one, in reality it is not; there is no electric current that has\r\never been produced that is one-tenth as dangerous as a steam boiler, and\r\nall these currents, however immense they may be, are very simply\r\ncontrolled, and very easily brought within the region of safety. There is\r\nno doubt that with the apparatus that is now being handled in this room,\r\nif anybody were deliberately to put one wire in his mouth and the other in\r\nhis hand, he would have the funeral service performed over him in two or\r\nthree days; but those who know what they are about no more handle electric\r\nlight wires carelessly than they put their hands in a furnace or their\r\nnoses in boiling water. We acquire experience by practice, and we know by\r\nthis time pretty well how to deal with electric currents. Now, you see in\r\nthe lower arrangement there that safety catches are being put in, which\r\nrender any accident quite impossible. Passing through each of those boxes\r\nthere is what is called a \"cut-out\" safety fuse, or safety valve, and\r\nshould, from any accident, anything go wrong in this theater, or in any\r\nway with the system outside the theater, the safety fuses would burst, and\r\nwould so remove all danger from inside. The switch has now been turned,\r\nand by it the current from the Grosvenor Gallery has been brought within\r\nour reach. You see an arc light produced by it, and you see how intensely\r\nbright and brilliant that light is. I do not want you so much to see that\r\nlight itself, but I want you to see its projection, or picture; and if Mr.\r\nWickham will kindly direct it on that white paper, at the end of the room\r\nfurthest from the table, you will see a picture of the carbons which are\r\nnow emitting that intense and brilliant light. You will see that between\r\nwhat appears to you as the top carbon (but which is in reality the bottom\r\ncarbon of the two) and the bottom one there is playing, apparently, a\r\nshower of minute fragments of something, but which are in reality\r\ninnumerable minute flashes of lightning, there is a constant uninterrupted\r\nshower of electric shocks passing, that produce that intense brilliancy,\r\nand that very bright appearance. There is intense commotion, a terrible\r\nsurging about of matter in a molten condition. Well, that arc that you see\r\nis produced by the currents from the Grosvenor Gallery. They are\r\nalternating currents of electricity, currents that are constantly and\r\nsuddenly circulating backward and forward. The arc that we have at this\r\nother end of the room is a direct current one, and it is now projected on\r\nto another sheet of paper, where you see a different form of are\r\naltogether. This arc is produced by the direct current from a battery. You\r\nwill see the form is quite different from that in the alternate current\r\narc. You heard a peculiar hissing sound just now; that is a peculiar\r\nphenomenon in arc lamps that has attracted a good deal of attention from\r\nphysicists, but nobody has yet arrived at a satisfactory conclusion as to\r\nthe cause. The lamp sometimes sings and sometimes hisses, and while thus\r\nbehaving it produces an intense and variable inverse electro-motive force,\r\nthat has to be overcome before the current can produce a steady and silent\r\narc. You will notice in the upper carbon of this form of lamp a kind of\r\ncup, or \"crater.\" The lower carbon forms a kind of point, a raised\r\nsurface, and between the two there is on the projection that which appears\r\nas a glow, but which in reality has very intense heat, reaching, as I told\r\nyou, a temperature of 8,500 deg. Fahr. In those two projections you have, I\r\nthink, within my experience for the first time, been shown in public an\r\nalternate current arc and a direct current arc at the same time, so that\r\nyou are really able to see what I do not think most people have seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many different arc lamps. I have not time to bring\r\nbefore you all the various lamps that I might have secured for your\r\ninspection. There is the Brush lamp, that for a long time lit up the\r\nstreets of our city, and I sincerely hope very soon is going to light up\r\nthe city again. There was the Jablochkoff lamp, that lighted up our Thames\r\nEmbankment, and which can be seen, on going down the Strand, at the Tivoli\r\nRestaurant, not far from here. The offices of the _Daily Telegraph_, in\r\nFleet Street, and many other places, are lighted up by different lamps,\r\nmany of them excellent. Our experience of the last two or three years at\r\nthe exhibitions has taught us that there are a great many different kinds\r\nof arc lamps, but all these arc lamps are lamps so constructed that they\r\ncause the pair of carbons to be fed, to be kept together, as they consume,\r\nat the same rate as they do consume. The mechanism is of great delicacy,\r\nit acts with great promptitude, and the one that we have here to-night is\r\none of the last and one of the best; it is known as the Brockie-Pell lamp.\r\nThe lamp now at work is a Brockie-Pell, and for those who are interested,\r\na diagram representing it is upon the wall, and its operation I shall be\r\nvery happy to explain after the lecture; it feeds with great rapidity,\r\nwith great convenience, and is one of the steadiest lamps we have.\r\n\r\nThere are objections to the arc light; it is extremely dazzling and\r\nirritating to the eye. Although the arc lamps we have here to-night are of\r\nthe very best of their kind, and are certainly almost steady, still they\r\nhave little irregularities in their action, and worst of all, they throw\r\nintense shadows. The light from them is not very well diffused, still the\r\nlight is very brilliant, and it raises the envy of a good many people. For\r\ninstance, the Brush Company were once establishing a light in the\r\nneighborhood of Cork, and an Irish farmer was remarkably struck by the\r\nappearance and the steadiness of the light, so he came to the engineer in\r\ncharge and asked him, as a great favor, if he could kindly tell him where\r\nhe got his oil from.\r\n\r\nI must now go from this to the next branch, the glow-lamp, the lamp that\r\nis burning so steadily and so nicely above us. For this lamp we do not use\r\nplatinum, such as I heated before you just now, but we use carbon, so fine\r\nthat although I have probably one hundred or more in my hand, they feel no\r\nheavier than a feather. These extremely fine filaments of carbon are made\r\nwith very great care from cotton. I cannot show you the whole operation of\r\nmaking carbons and some of the preliminary operations connected with the\r\nmaking of the lamp; but owing to the kindness of the Anglo-American Brush\r\nCompany, their manager, Mr. Sillar, is here to-night, and we shall have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing how the whole operation of the manufacture of one\r\nof these glow lamps, such as we have above us now, is carried out. The\r\ncarbons have already been formed, but the first process is that the cotton\r\nfiber is carefully tied and wrapped around pieces of carbon, as you see.\r\nIt is then placed in a furnace and carbonized. After being thus prepared,\r\na glass tube of special quality selected for the purpose is used to form\r\nthe glass globe. Mr. Donaldson will take a piece of the glass tube before\r\nyou, and will blow it into the shape similar to the lamp I hold, which is\r\nof the very familiar pear-like form. The carbon filament will then be\r\nfixed in the glass bulb, the latter will be exhausted and sealed, and the\r\nwhole process be passed through before your eyes. I must first of all show\r\nyou why it is necessary to take all this care. We have in front of the\r\nboard one of these carbon filaments suspended, and we will now pass a\r\ncurrent through it, and the carbon filament is raised to incandescence, it\r\ncombines with the oxygen of the air, it is at once consumed, and, as you\r\nsaw, we only had a light for a few seconds. Now, in order to make that\r\nlight permanent, it is necessary to inclose the carbon filament in a glass\r\nglobe, and to exhaust from that glass globe all the air, or as much of it\r\nas possible, and then, instead of having a life of a few seconds, the life\r\nof a lamp frequently continues for 4,000 or 5,000 hours. The first\r\nprocess, as I said, in making an incandescent lamp, after the carbon\r\nfilament has been prepared, is that of blowing a glass bulb. The blowpipe\r\nhas now been put on, and the intense heat of the Bunsen burner raises the\r\nglass to incandescence, to a soft, plastic condition, so plastic that the\r\nmanipulator can do with it just whatever he likes. Having got the glass\r\nto this particular shape, the filament will be placed inside it, first of\r\nall mounting the filament, which is an operation requiring a great deal of\r\ncare and great skill in handling. It is an extremely pretty operation, and\r\nI beg to call your attention to it. The carbon is fixed inside a fine\r\nspiral of platinum, which is at the same time subjected to an intense\r\ncurrent which decomposes the oil or the hydrocarbon in which it is placed,\r\nthe carbon deposits on the carbon filament, and cements it to the platinum\r\nspiral. That is called mounting the filament. When that is done, the\r\nfilament is fixed in the glass globe, and the platinum and glass are fused\r\ntogether. The brilliance of the platinum can be seen during this\r\noperation, and it is very pretty. I do not know how it would have been\r\npossible for us to have glow-lamps if it had not been for the fact that\r\nthe coefficients or rates of expansion of platinum and glass are\r\npractically exactly the same, and the result is that when the platinum and\r\nglass are combined together, as they are in a glow-lamp, the two contract\r\nand expand at the same rate, and the result is there is no leakage; if\r\nthere had been leakage through the glass, it would have been quite\r\nimpossible to have made a glow-lamp. The success of a glow-lamp depends\r\nupon the vacuum produced, and the next process is to cement the lamp so\r\nfar to a vacuum tube connected to a mercurial air-pump. The one before you\r\nis Mr. Lane Fox's. It would have been also impossible to have produced\r\nthese beautiful glow-lamps without the mercurial air-pump, so that the\r\nsuccess of electric lighting and its perfection depend upon, first, the\r\nsimilarity of expansion of glass and platinum, and secondly upon our power\r\nof producing a vacuum. As it takes ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to\r\ncarry out the process of exhaustion, I will proceed with other portions of\r\nmy subject, and presently, when the time is ready, Mr. Sillar will inform\r\nme, and we will light up the lamp that has been made before you this\r\nevening, and, I hope, with success. The operation we have just seen is one\r\nthat has been just as interesting to me as it has been to you. There are\r\nvery few who are permitted to see this operation. We once had it before in\r\nthis hall when General Webber read a paper on glow-lamps, but with that\r\nexception I am not aware that the manufacture of glow-lamps has ever been\r\nshown in public before. It is most wonderful to watch the marvelous way in\r\nwhich glass can be twisted and turned to our ways and to our wants, and\r\nthe skill with which the blower is able to manipulate glass in its plastic\r\ncondition, and to shape it in any form he likes, is an operation which\r\nnever ceases to excite one's wonderment. The form of lamp that is being\r\nmade before us is of the ordinary size that we see used generally, but\r\nthere are a great many different sizes of glow-lamps. For instance, here\r\nis a very small lamp; above me you will see, if I may call the small one a\r\ndwarf, there is a giant glow-lamp. It is a lamp invented by the Honorable\r\nCharles Parsons, it is made by the Sunbeam Lamp Company, of Gateshead, and\r\nis called the Sunbeam lamp; it has the same proportion to an ordinary lamp\r\nthat an ostrich egg has to a hen's egg, and the light from it is of\r\nequally large proportion, as you see now the current has been turned on to\r\nit. It gives a light of four hundred candles, but it is rather too\r\nbrilliant I see by your faces, and we will go back to our old friends of\r\nthe ordinary size. There are also above us lamps of various sizes; there\r\nis a five-candle, ten-candle, sixteen-candle, twenty-candle, and a\r\nhundred-candle lamp. Here also are a fifty-candle Swan lamp, a\r\nsixteen-candle Swan, and an eight-candle Swan lamp. There are the ordinary\r\nsixteen-candle lamp; these are being burned from the Grosvenor Gallery.\r\nHere is a miner's lamp, which is supplied with a current by the\r\nSchanschieff battery, the same as I showed you at first. The peculiarity\r\nof this arrangement is that when the battery is turned upside down the\r\nlight goes off, the zincs and carbons occupy one half of the cell, and the\r\nsolution the other half, the zincs and carbons being at the bottom, and\r\nthe battery is not excited unless contact is made with the carbons and\r\nzinc. Such a battery as this will maintain its lamp for 12 or 13 hours.\r\nThere are several forms of the Schanschieff battery. Here is a portable\r\nform, and lamp connected with it by a flexible wire, which can be used\r\nwhen traveling; or in the night, when you want to know the time, you can\r\nhave a lamp and battery like this by your bedside, and you can turn it\r\nupside down, and produce a light, see the hour, and turn the battery back.\r\n\r\nThese glow-lamps are used for different purposes and ways. They may be\r\nused with care, they may be used recklessly; their duration depends a good\r\ndeal upon the care with which they are used. A practiced eye, one who is\r\naccustomed to deal with electric lamps, can tell at a glance when the lamp\r\nis raised to a proper incandescence; but there is a point in all lamps\r\nthat is a sign of danger, and indicates \"breakers (or breakage) ahead.\"\r\nWhenever in an electric light installation a glow-lamp begins to show a\r\nblue effect, then breakers are ahead; the current must be reduced or other\r\nsteps taken. I want to show you this blue effect, which is extremely\r\npretty, and I want you to see the gradual stages through which a lamp\r\npasses from long life to death, or rather to a very short and merry life.\r\nWe can make the life of a lamp just exactly what we like; we can make a\r\nlamp last a minute, or we can make it last a hundred years, and the number\r\nof years of its duration is simply dependent upon the current employed. I\r\nhave here a glow-lamp, and I pass a current through it. There is no blue\r\neffect at present; the current is increased, and the carbon filament is\r\nraised to a high state of incandescence. In such a state it would not last\r\nfor a long time, not more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; but it\r\ndoes not show the blue effect yet. On further increasing the current the\r\nblue effect appears, though I doubt whether it is visible to many of the\r\naudience; a little more current is put on, and the blue effect is very\r\nmarked, the globe itself looks very brilliant, and--there--the current has\r\nbeen increased until the filament has parted.\r\n\r\nIt is always better, when making an observation or experiment, to know\r\nwhat you are going to see, so that you can direct your attention to\r\nexactly what is being done or to what you want to know. If I put another\r\nlamp through the same experiment, you will be better able to understand\r\nthis blue effect, and see just that point where the lamp is about to give\r\nout. The current is now on, and is being gradually increased; the lamp is\r\nnow intensely blue, and--there--it has gone in the same way exactly as the\r\nother one did. The way in which lamps burst is sometimes very beautiful;\r\nthey disintegrate, they seem to volatilize, and the substance of the lamp\r\nis projected with great force against the side of the globe. On the table\r\nthere are several beautiful specimens showing this effect.\r\n\r\nThe glow-lamp in process of manufacture before you is now being unsealed\r\nfrom the pump; it is now exhausted, and we will pass a current through it\r\nso as to raise it to incandescence. The current is now on, and you see the\r\nlamp burns with full brilliancy. The next experiment is rather a cruel\r\none, because it is willful destruction. I will not destroy the lamp that\r\nhas just been made before us, for I will keep it as a memento of this\r\nevening. I want to show the safety of the electric lamp. Many people\r\nimagine that there is a great deal of danger about it. I will take a\r\nhandkerchief, and in it place a lighted lamp, when, on the globe being\r\nbroken, the carbon filament instantly goes out, and there is no damage to\r\nthe handkerchief, or the slightest appearance of scorching or heating upon\r\nit. On breaking that lamp you heard a report. That is due to the vacuum,\r\nwhich, on sudden rupture, the air rushes in to fill. These lamps will not\r\nonly burn in air, but will actually burn in water. Here I have a lamp\r\nwhich on placing in a bowl of water continues alight in the water just as\r\nwell as in the air. You can imagine what an immense boon that is to our\r\ndivers and others who unfortunately have to work under water for our\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to occupy your time in speaking of the beauties of this\r\nwonderful light, how it removes really poison from our air, how it is very\r\ngood for sore eyes, because it burns with such steadiness that those who\r\nwork under it really never find, in any shape or form, any inconvenience\r\nor discomfort to the eyes. It is extremely cleanly; it does not fill the\r\nair we breathe with noxious fumes. People are little aware of it, but it\r\nis a very simple calculation to show that thirty gas burners produce a\r\ngallon of water in an hour, so that if you have thirty burners in a shop,\r\nfor instance, alight for six hours, six gallons of water are produced and\r\nthe water can very often be seen running down the cold windows of shops.\r\nThat water absorbs sulphur and sulphuric acid, and when deposited on books\r\nand decorations destroys them. If we could only get the electric light\r\ncheap, delivered at our doors, then everybody who has an idea of luxury\r\nand comfort would at once take it.\r\n\r\nI want now to show you some of the dodges of the electric light. First I\r\nwill show you that by the action of a cut-out an excess of current is\r\nprevented from injuring the lamps. A cut-out is inserted so as to protect\r\na group of lamps here, and on a large current being sent you hear a crack,\r\nand the lamps have gone out; the safety fuse has perished in performing\r\nits duty. To prove this we will renew the cut-out, and on the proper\r\ncurrent being turned on, you see the lamps are sound. Here is an electric\r\ncigar lighter. I raise this up and the wire in front of it comes to a\r\nstate of incandescence, and I have there, as you see, sufficient heat to\r\nlight my cigarette. Some years ago, I had my daughter's doll house, which\r\nwas furnished by herself, fitted up with the electric light, and I thought\r\nthat some of my younger hearers to-night, who were still in the doll age,\r\nwould appreciate the way in which a doll's house can be lighted up by\r\nelectricity. You now see the doll's house illuminated; it has a hall door\r\nlamp which lights up on the opening of the door; the house has rooms\r\nfurnished, occupied with handsome dolls, and fitted with every kind of\r\ncontrivance; the doll who occupies the drawing room has the convenience of\r\na portable lamp, which she can move about wherever she likes, and each\r\nroom and the kitchen has a particular form of lamp.\r\n\r\nI have also here a model of that famous ship the Captain, which was\r\nwrecked off Cape Finisterre. The model has been fitted with electric\r\nlight, and you now see the mast head-light, the red light for the port\r\nside, and the green light for the starboard side; there are high jinks\r\ngoing on in the saloon by the aid of the electric light, and there is also\r\na search light which can be used for looking for the advance of the enemy.\r\nA beautiful phosphorescent effect is produced upon the water, which is\r\ncovered with blue cotton wool, in which a lamp is placed, causing really a\r\nvery pretty illustration of what the phosphorescence of the sea is like.\r\n\r\nHere I have an apparatus for heating curling tongs by electricity; here is\r\na flat iron treated in the same way, and here is a kettle in which the\r\ncurrent is carried to boil water. I travel a good deal, and I always carry\r\nin my traveling bag a battery like this, which is one of Pitkin's\r\nsecondary batteries; it is light and extremely convenient. I can strap it\r\non my shoulder like an opera glass. To this is attached a reading lamp\r\nwhich I fix in my waistcoat, and to the astonishment of my fellow\r\ntravelers, when the shades of evening are beginning to set, I take out the\r\nlamp and put it in operation--so. My reading lamp is thus provided, and it\r\nis fixed in the most convenient position, for the light falls just where\r\nit is wanted, it does not offend the eye, and enables me to read the\r\nsmallest print. I have always got with me my own light, perhaps much to\r\nthe annoyance of my fellow passengers, and with the electric light\r\nmachinery at my own house, I have little or no trouble in recharging the\r\nbattery, or keeping it in order. The Pitkin battery is also applied to a\r\nminer's lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  EFFECT OF CHLORINE ON THE ELECTRO-MOTIVE FORCE OF A VOLTAIC COUPLE.[6]\r\n\r\n                          By D. G. GORE, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the electro-motive force of a small voltaic couple of unamalgamated\r\nmagnesium and platinum and distilled water is balanced through the coil of\r\na moderately sensitive galvanometer of about 100 ohms resistance, by means\r\nof that of a small Daniells cell, plus that of a sufficient number of\r\ncouples of iron and German silver of a suitable thermo-electric pile (see\r\nProc. Birm. Phil. Soc., vol. iv., p. 130), the degree of potential being\r\nnoted, and sufficiently minute quantities of very dilute chlorine water\r\nare then added in succession to the distilled water, the degree of\r\nelectro-motive force of the couple is not affected until a certain\r\ndefinite proportion of chlorine has been added; the potential then\r\nsuddenly commences to increase, and continues to do so with each further\r\naddition within a certain limit. Instead of making the experiment by\r\nadding chlorine water, it may be made by gradually diluting a very weak\r\naqueous solution of chlorine.\r\n\r\n[6] Read before the Royal Society, May 3, 1888.\r\n\r\nThe minimum proportion of chlorine necessary to cause this sudden change\r\nof electro-motive force is extremely small; in my experiments it has been\r\none part in 17,000 million parts of water;[7] or less than 1/7000 part of\r\nthat required to yield a barely perceptible opacity in ten times the bulk\r\nof a solution of sal-ammoniac by means of nitrate of silver. The quantity\r\nof liquid required for acting upon the couple is small, and it would be\r\neasy to detect the effect of the above proportion or of less than one\r\nten-thousand millionth part of a grain of chlorine in one tenth of a cubic\r\ncentimeter of distilled water by this process. The same kind of action\r\noccurs with other electrolytes, but requires larger proportions of\r\ndissolved substance.\r\n\r\n[7] As one part of chlorine in 17,612 million parts of water had no\r\nvisible effect, and one in 17,000 million had a distinct effect, the\r\ninfluence of the difference, or of one part in 500,000 millions, has been\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nAs the degree of sensitiveness of the method appears extreme, I add the\r\nfollowing remarks: The original solution of washed chlorine in distilled\r\nwater was prepared in a dark place by the usual method from hydrochloric\r\nacid and manganic oxide, and was kept in an opaque, well-stoppered bottle\r\nin the dark. The strength of this liquid was found by means of volumetric\r\nanalysis with a standard solution of argentic nitrate in the usual manner.\r\nThe accuracy of the silver solution being proved by means of a known\r\nweight of pure chloride of sodium. The chlorine liquid contained 2.3\r\nmilligrammes or 0.03565 grain of chlorine per cubic centimeter, and was\r\njust about three-fourths saturated.\r\n\r\nOne tenth of a cubic centimeter of this solution (\"No. 1\") or 0.003565\r\ngrain of chlorine was added to 9.9 c. c. of distilled water and mixed. One\r\ncubic centimeter of this second liquid (\"No. 2\"), or 0.0003565 grain of\r\nchlorine, was added to 99 c. c. of water and mixed; the resulting liquid\r\n(\"No. 3\") contained 0.000003565 grain of chlorine per cubic centim. To\r\nmake the solutions (\"No. 4\") for exciting voltaic couple, successive\r\nportions of 1/10 or 1/20 c. c. of \"No. 3\" liquid were added to 900 cubic\r\ncentimeters of distilled water and mixed.\r\n\r\nI have employed the foregoing method for examining the states and degrees\r\nof combination of dissolved substances in electrolytes, and am also\r\ninvestigating its various relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE WIMSHURST INFLUENCE MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last number we gave illustrations of this machine, in which 12\r\nplates 30 in. in diameter are used, and sparks nearly 14 in. in length are\r\nobtained. The engraving, from photographs, shows sparks 13-1/2 in. in length,\r\nobtained from this machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISCHARGE FROM THE WIMSHURST INFLUENCE MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SANITATION IN MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject was prominently considered by Dr. H. P. Walcott, of Boston,\r\nin his address on state medicine, at the meeting of the American Medical\r\nAssociation recently. The vital statistics of Massachusetts, he said,\r\nshowed a declining death rate for the last thirty-six years, under the\r\ninfluence of state sanitation. The most marked decrease had been observed\r\nin the mortality from zymotic diseases; there had been a less decided\r\nreduction of that from constitutional diseases; that from local diseases\r\nhad increased; and that from mental diseases and from violence had\r\nremained stationary. In 1876 there was not a single death from small-pox.\r\nTyphoid fever had diminished most in cities having a good system of\r\nsewerage and water supply, and least in towns without such improvements.\r\nDiphtheria, which reached its maximum in 1877, had since declined, until\r\nit now caused only one per cent. of the total mortality. Ovariotomy saved\r\nmore lives than any other surgical operation, but, taking Somerville as a\r\nbasis of calculation, the ascertained results of preventive medicine had\r\nsaved more lives in ten years, among thirty thousand people, than\r\novariotomy would save in the same time among two millions. Great attention\r\nwas given to small-pox, which had killed but 5,500 persons in\r\nMassachusetts in thirty-six years, and to cholera, which had destroyed\r\nonly 2,000; but too little heed was given to scarlet fever, with its\r\nmortality of 37,000, and to typhoid fever, with its mortality of\r\n45,000.--_N. Y. Med. Jour._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE CARE OF THE EYES.[8]\r\n\r\n                     By Prof. DAVID WEBSTER, M.D.\r\n\r\n                               SPECTACLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA vast amount of popular misapprehension and prejudice exists as to the\r\nuse of spectacles. Many persons who need them object to wearing them for\r\nvarious reasons. Some fear that it will lead their friends to suspect that\r\nthey are getting old. Others think it will cause them to be suspected of\r\nwishing to appear learned or cultured. Some persons do not want to begin\r\nto wear them lest, having acquired the habit, they may not be able to\r\nleave them off or to see well without them. Others again object to glasses\r\nonly on account of their inconvenience. I have personally met with many of\r\nall these classes of persons, but I have frequently heard of another class\r\nthat I have never met with, namely, those who do not need glasses, but who\r\nwear them just for effect and to attract attention. Now, the simple truth\r\nis that there are just two good reasons for wearing spectacles, and only\r\ntwo. One is that we may see better, the other is that our eyes may be\r\nrelieved of strain. Often both these reasons are combined in the same\r\ncase. Many children begin to be near-sighted after they have attended\r\nschool a few years. They first find it out by observing that they cannot\r\nsee letters or figures on the blackboard as far as the other children.\r\nThey can use their eyes as much as they want to without fatigue or\r\nblurring, or smarting, or burning, or itching, or pain in the eyes, or\r\nheadache. In short, they show no symptoms of eye strain. They simply do\r\nnot see distant objects distinctly. Such children should be fitted with\r\nglasses at once that will enable them to see as well as others at a\r\ndistance, and these glasses should be worn constantly. The child should be\r\ninstructed to take them off only when necessary to wipe them or to wipe or\r\nbathe the eyes and on going to bed. The sooner the eyes get accustomed to\r\nthem the less likely is the near-sightedness to increase. Moreover, the\r\nchild who sees clearly only a few feet away from him loses a very\r\nimportant part of his education. Our eyes gather information for us when\r\nwe are least thinking of it, by taking cognizance of the many objects that\r\ncome within our field of vision just as our ears gather material for the\r\nproper development of our minds in listening to general conversation or to\r\nthe sounds of nature and of busy life about us. It is the duty of every\r\none to make the best possible use of the faculties the Creator has\r\nbestowed upon him. The near-sighted person who does not have his vision\r\ncorrected by glasses fails in the performance of this duty.\r\n\r\n[8] Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 647, page 10342.\r\n\r\nFrom a paper by David Webster. M.D., professor of ophthalmology in the New\r\nYork Polyclinic and surgeon to the Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital, New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nAgain, the time comes in the life of every one who is not near-sighted,\r\nand who lives to a good old age, when he cannot see near objects well\r\nwithout glasses. Between the ages of 40 and 50, the crystalline lenses of\r\nhis eyes having hardened along with the other tissues of his body, he\r\nfinds it impossible to focalize as he used to. He holds his book farther\r\nand farther away from his eyes, and finally he finds that he cannot read\r\nfine print at all, or without straining his eyes. Then he must accept the\r\nunpleasant fact that he is getting old-sighted, and if he wishes to use,\r\nand not abuse, his eyes, he must get glasses to take the place of his lost\r\naccommodation and with which he can read easily. Some persons who are\r\nnear-sighted in one eye and far-sighted in the other never need glasses,\r\nbut always do their reading and other near work with the near-sighted eye\r\nand their distant seeing with the far-sighted eye. I believe I read a long\r\ntime ago, in an article by himself in the New York _Ledger_, that this was\r\nthe case with the late Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. But the vast majority of\r\npersons who wear glasses, both for the distance and for the near, can see\r\nquite as well without them. They do not wear them in order to be able to\r\nsee, but in order to have the strain removed from their eyes, and to be\r\nrelieved from the many disagreeable symptoms, both direct and reflex, that\r\nresult from eye strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FOCALIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe act of focalization is a muscular act and requires an effort, an\r\noutput of nervous energy, just as much in proportion as any other\r\nmuscular act, such as lifting a weight or shoving a saw or a jack plane.\r\nThe eye that is normally shaped forms pictures of objects, more than a few\r\nfeet distant, on its back wall without any muscular effort, and has to\r\nfocalize only when engaged in near work. But the oversighted eye is\r\ncompelled to do this extra work all the time, except when closed. If it\r\ndid not focalize, it would see indistinctly. This it refuses to do,\r\nindependently of any volition on the part of its owner. The eye that _can_\r\nsee distinctly _will_ see distinctly, no matter how great the strain, and\r\nthis by a volition apparently entirely its own. The results are headache,\r\nvertigo, nausea, nervousness, irritability, and other disagreeable reflex\r\nconditions, besides the pain and inflammation, and other symptoms\r\nmanifested in the eyes themselves. Of course, the only remedy in such\r\ncases is glasses, and these glasses should be carefully selected by a\r\ncompetent person, and should be worn as much of the time as is necessary\r\nto relieve the eye strain. I find in _Taggart's Times_, February 5, 1888,\r\nthe following: \"A French philosopher has said that a man who wears\r\ngold-bowed spectacles always admires himself, and it would seem as though\r\nspectacles were becoming a sort of badge of distinction, since young and\r\nold who have the slightest excuse for using them put them on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HEADACHE.\r\n\r\n\"When one suffers from headache, he is told that he overstrains the nerves\r\nof the eyes, and must relieve this by the use of spectacles. When things\r\ndance before the sight, the cure for that is also spectacles; and when\r\ntired with close attention to work, the cure for wearied eyes is not rest,\r\nbut spectacles.\r\n\r\n\"People who live much out of doors are usually very keen-sighted, owing\r\nprobably to the ever-varying impressions made on the eyes, and this might\r\nreasonably suggest that the proper relief for a great many eye troubles\r\nwould be a change from overwork.\"\r\n\r\nI can only say that the person who wrote it seems not only to be\r\nprejudiced against glasses, but to know very little of the anatomy and\r\nphysiology of the eye. The fact is that oversighted and astigmatic eyes,\r\nneeding glasses to relieve the constant and severe strain upon the\r\naccommodative muscular apparatus, are benefited by rest and by change of\r\nair and occupation only to a limited degree. Real rest for such eyes is\r\npossible only from the use of glasses. Moreover, it is not possible for\r\nall who suffer from fatigue of the eyes to take the time for rest. It is\r\nnecessary for many to use their eyes daily and almost constantly in order\r\nto make a living for themselves and for those dependent upon them. There\r\nis much more good sense in the paragraphs which follow and which are\r\nextracted from the same article.\r\n\r\n\"It is not surprising that so many school children suffer with weak eyes\r\nwhen we consider the conditions under which they are forced to use them.\r\nThe very fact that the light in many school rooms is twice strained\r\nthrough glass partitions before it penetrates the inside rooms is in\r\nitself a severe test of sight. The preponderance of sash-wood over the\r\npanes of glass is anything but propitious to clear seeing. With heads bent\r\nover desks doing arithmetical examples, or studying the fine printed\r\nschool books, or reading their own imperfect handwriting from which many\r\nof the lessons must be learned, the only wonder is that all the little\r\nones are not purblind before they reach the grammar schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FLUFFY BANGS.\r\n\r\n\"But this is not all. Girls wear long and fluffy bangs, intercepting the\r\nsight, and both boys and girls seldom bathe their faces with clear cold\r\nwater. In the matutinal face washing the eyes are usually closed, while a\r\nwet towel is delicately passed over the eyelids. Few persons can bear the\r\npain of opening their eyes wide in a basin of cold water, yet Mr. A. M.\r\nSpangler told, in his interesting lecture on Nassau, how the native\r\npopulation would dive to the bottom of the sea and bring up shells,\r\nsponges, etc., that had been pointed out to them by curious visitors\r\nthrough a sea glass. Not only men divers, but also little boys and girls\r\ncould keep their eyes open in the water and search for cents which had\r\nbeen thrown in for them to pick up. This shows that even salt water is not\r\ninjurious to eyes accustomed to it, and that habit makes the eye\r\nunnaturally sensitive.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the statement that \"people who live much out of doors are usually\r\nvery keen-sighted,\" it is an expression of a popular idea, but, like most\r\npopular ideas, is true only to a limited extent. The fact is that persons\r\nwho do not live much out of doors generally use their eyes more for near\r\nwork, such as reading, sewing, drawing, etc., and hence are more likely to\r\ndevelop near-sightedness. Persons living indoors who are not near-sighted\r\nare able to see as well and as far as those who live outdoors. It is true\r\nthat the old sailor will recognize a ship in the horizon, or any other\r\ndistant object at sea, sooner than a landsman. But it is not because he is\r\nany more \"keen-sighted.\" It is because he knows just what to look for. He\r\nhas seen such objects amid similar surroundings a thousand times, and\r\nrecognizes them, even though his vision be considerably impaired by\r\ndisease. I have often found, on testing the vision of such persons, that\r\nit was not more than one-half the normal, and yet they declared, and, I\r\nbelieve, conscientiously so, that they could discern a ship at sea as far\r\nas any one. A very large proportion of the North American Indians, who\r\nlive much out of doors, have poor sight from inflammatory diseases of\r\ntheir eyes caused by exposure to smoke in their wigwams, and by contagious\r\neye diseases, the propagation of which is favored by their unsanitary\r\nmethods of living. But, no doubt, many of them can discern distant objects\r\nupon the prairies and in the forests farther than their white brothers\r\nbecause of their greater familiarity with the appearances of such objects.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the practice of opening the eyes under water is not to\r\nbe specially recommended, except in cases of necessity. While many bear it\r\nwell, to others it is more or less painful and irritating. Moreover,\r\nnature furnishes a fluid with which to wash the eyeballs, and applies it\r\nherself. It is only necessary to keep the eyelids scrupulously clean, and\r\nespecially the edges of the eyelids where the eyelashes grow out. For\r\nbathing the eyelids when uninflamed, nothing is better than pure cold\r\nwater. When the eyes become red and inflamed, the best domestic remedy is\r\nsalt and water, about a teaspoonful to the pint, and applied warm or cold,\r\nor at whatever temperature seems most agreeable to the eyes in any\r\nparticular case.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NO POULTICES.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances should poultices be applied to the eyes unless\r\nordered by a physician. I have seen many cases in which a simple\r\ninflammation of the inside lining of the eyelids had been greatly\r\naggravated by bread and milk poultices, or tea leaves, bound upon the\r\nclosed eyelids and left on overnight. In fact, a distinguished professor\r\nof diseases of the eye has formulated the results of his observations\r\nthus: \"Poultices spoil eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAll patent eye washes, eye salves, and other remedies advertised to cure\r\nall diseases of the eye should be avoided. Different diseases require\r\ndifferent remedies. What will benefit one may injure another. When one\r\ngets something the matter with his eyes and resorts to the use of a patent\r\nmedicine for its relief, he is in danger of losing valuable time. He may\r\nlose an eye from want of proper treatment at the outset of the disease. In\r\na great city like New York, every one may easily avail himself of the\r\nservices of the most skillful physician. If unable to visit them at their\r\noffices and pay their fees, they may consult them at the numerous\r\ndispensaries, hospitals, and medical schools and colleges, where it will\r\ncost them nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         USE OF INFLAMED EYES.\r\n\r\nA lesson that is very difficult for many of us to learn is that inflamed\r\neyes should not be used actively. Children with sore eyes should not be\r\nallowed to go to school for two reasons. First, the use of their eyes in\r\nreading will prevent or retard their recovery. Secondly, sore eyes are\r\nusually communicable, and one such child may infect a whole school. It is\r\nhighly important that all persons with inflamed eyes should use only their\r\nown wash basins, towels, and handkerchiefs, and so avoid spreading the\r\ndisease. We not infrequently see a catarrhal inflammation of the eyes run\r\nthrough a whole family. Of course, they catch it one from another, and, as\r\nthere is no disease of the eye which is, like measles, or scarlet fever,\r\nor smallpox, communicable through the air, such spread of the disease\r\nmight easily be prevented by proper care of the person first affected.\r\nPersons whose eyes are sensitive to light should not be kept in dark\r\nrooms, which are always unhealthy. They may have their eyes protected by\r\nshades or by smoke colored glasses, but should keep them open and exposed\r\nto the air, and should remain out of doors as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n              EFFECT OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO UPON THE EYES.\r\n\r\nI must not close without warning my hearers against the baneful effects of\r\nalcohol and tobacco upon the eyes. It is not uncommon for the eye surgeon\r\nto meet with persons who have become partially blind from the effects of\r\nthese poisons upon their optic nerves. Of course, only a small proportion\r\nof those who use alcohol and tobacco to excess are affected in this way,\r\nbut this renders it none the less certain that impaired sight is one of\r\nthe dangers that we may avoid by abstaining from the use of these\r\nunnecessary and poisonous luxuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TUMORS OF THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\n       DIAGNOSED BY MEANS OF THE ELECTRO-ENDOSCOPIC CYSTOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n                           By Dr. MAX NITZE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following lines I wish to direct the attention of my English\r\n_confreres_ to the value of the electro-endoscopic mode of examination of\r\nthe male urinary bladder, invented by me. I believe I could not have\r\nchosen a more suitable theme for that purpose than a short report of the\r\nbladder tumors diagnosed by me cystoscopically; for the diagnosis of these\r\nnew formations offers the greatest difficulty, and in most cases it has\r\nbeen impossible till now to prove their existence with accuracy without\r\ndigital exploration of the bladder. By the new method of cystoscopical\r\nexamination the conditions have entirely changed. One look into the\r\nbladder, illuminated as if by daylight, is generally sufficient to afford\r\nmeans for forming an opinion of all the questions coming into\r\nconsideration--viz., size, form, and site of the tumor. The accompanying\r\ndiagrams (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) may give an idea of the appearances which the\r\ndifferent forms of bladder tumors present endoscopically. I regret that\r\nthey cannot show the brightness of the light by which one sees the tumors\r\nduring examination. The celebrated Vienna specialist, V. Dittel, is right\r\nin saying that \"they offer sometimes truly charming pictures;\" especially\r\ncertain kinds of villous tumors, whose long slender villi floating in the\r\nliquid often present a splendid appearance. The following are the cases\r\ncystoscopically diagnosed by me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n_Case 1._--A man, aged fifty-five, under the care of Dr. Ch. Mayer,\r\nsuffered from attacks of haematuria for thirty years. During the last six\r\nyears he has had dysuria and inability to empty the bladder completely.\r\nThe patient had been examined by the sound repeatedly by eminent surgeons\r\nand specialists, but none could give a certain diagnosis. On Nov. 11,\r\n1886, I undertook the cystoscopic examination. I found on the anterior\r\nwall of the bladder a puffy swelling covered with white masses of mucus.\r\n(See Fig. 1.) The trigone was covered by a mass consisting of pointed\r\npapillae. On account of the weakness of the patient extirpation was\r\nimpossible. The patient became weaker and weaker, and died in June, 1887.\r\nThe post mortem examination showed the internal orifice of the urethra\r\nsurrounded by a swelling representing a continuous tumor as large as a\r\nsmall apple. It was found that the instrument had penetrated through the\r\nmiddle of this swelling, which bled easily on pressure. In spite of this,\r\nthe clearness of the picture was not interfered with in the least.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n_Case 2._--A man, aged fifty, was obliged to exert a strong pressure in\r\norder to empty the bladder. The flow of urine often stopped. He himself\r\nintroduced a catheter, and on withdrawing it a piece of villous tissue was\r\nfound. On Dec. 10, 1886, I saw, on cystoscopical examination, directly and\r\nimmediately over the internal orifice of the urethra, a villous swelling\r\nhanging from the anterior wall of the bladder. (See Fig. 2.) On Jan. 15,\r\n1887, extirpation of the tumor by means of the high section was performed\r\nby Professor v. Bergmann. The size of the tumor (which was as large as a\r\npigeon's egg) and its position corresponded exactly to the endoscopic\r\npicture. The patient recovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n_Case 3._--A patient under the care of Professor Madelung, aged\r\nfifty-five, suffered from attacks of haematuria. Examination by sound and\r\nrectal palpation had given me negative results. On Feb. 20, 1887,\r\ncystoscopical examination was made. On the left side of the trigone a\r\ntumor with a broad base was seen, which resembled somewhat a strawberry in\r\nsize and form. (See Fig. 3.) On March 1, Professor Madelung undertook the\r\nextirpation of the tumor. The appearance corresponded exactly to the\r\ncystoscopic picture. The patient recovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n_Case 4._--This was a patient on whom Dr. Israel had performed the high\r\nsection a long time before, on account of a bladder tumor. The extent was\r\nso great that only its most prominent part could be removed. The\r\nmicroscopical examination proved the diagnosis of cancer. Quick healing\r\ntook place. The patient became free from pain, and the urine became clear.\r\nIn order to see what had become of the remaining part, the cystoscopical\r\nexamination was undertaken on April 3. It was easy to see that the right\r\nlateral wall was covered to an extent of from three to four centimeters\r\nwith thick masses of verrucous and fungiform excrescences. (See Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\n[We omit the description of the additional cases.]\r\n\r\nThe above shortly described fifteen[9] cases of bladder tumors have been\r\ndiagnosed by me cystoscopically during the last sixteen months. This is a\r\nproof, on the one hand, of the value of the cystoscopic examination; on\r\nthe other hand, of the fact that the new formations in question are not of\r\nso rare occurrence as has been hitherto thought. I would like to emphasize\r\nthat the important results were often obtained under the most difficult\r\ncircumstances. In several cases the external orifice of the urethra was\r\nfound abnormally small; in others (Cases 8 and 11) the examination was\r\nmade during the occurrence of a continuous hemorrhage from the tumor; in\r\none case (Case 1) I introduced the instrument through the center of the\r\ntumor, which bled on the slightest pressure. In spite of this the\r\nappearances were seen satisfactorily. In the first case a post mortem\r\nexamination was made; in eight other cases (Cases 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14,\r\nand 15) the tumor was extirpated, seven times by the high section--in one\r\ncase, that of a woman, through the dilated urethra. In these nine cases\r\nthe endoscopic appearances were in every important respect confirmed in\r\nthe most perfect manner. In every case my opinion regarding the size,\r\nposition, and form was found to be correct. It is only in those cases\r\nwhere the edges of the tumor overlap the short pedicle that the latter\r\ncannot be observed. Besides, the relative good results of the operations\r\nundertaken on account of the cystoscopic appearance may be emphasized. Of\r\nthe eight patients from whom the tumors had been extirpated, none died\r\nfrom the result of the operation. Case 9 proved fatal on account of the\r\nprogressive extension of the growth. In the eleventh case there was a\r\nrecurrence, but the patient is still alive. Five patients (Cases 2, 3, 10,\r\n13, 14) must be considered entirely cured. Case 15 is still under\r\ntreatment, and, as the conditions of the patient are at present (ninth day\r\nafter operation) in every way satisfactory, a complete recovery is\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n[9] The first eight cases are more fully described in the Arch. fur\r\nChirurgie, vol. xxxvi., Part 3 (Dr. Nitze, Beitrage zur Endoscopie der\r\nmannlichen Harnblase). The full account of the last seven cases will be\r\npublished soon.\r\n\r\nFinally, on comparing the above cystoscopic appearances with the results\r\nobtained by other methods of examination, it must be observed that the\r\nexamination of the urine, in most cases carefully made, had only in two\r\ncases shown the presence of villous tissue, which in one instance was\r\nbrought out by the catheter. The rectal palpation, when made, had always\r\ngiven negative results. Further, the examination by means of the sound had\r\nbeen made in nine cases before the cystoscopic examination. In none of the\r\ncases had the sound revealed the presence of a tumor (which in two had\r\nattained the size of a small apple), although the examination was made by\r\nmost experienced surgeons and eminent specialists. Those cases show how\r\nimperfect an instrument the sound is for the diagnosis of bladder tumors.\r\n\r\nOnly one method can compare with the cystoscope in giving valuable\r\ninformation regarding the size and nature of a bladder tumor--viz., the\r\ndigital exploration of the internal surface of the bladder after a\r\nprevious _boutonniere_, or the high section. The superiority of the\r\ncystoscopic method over the latter, on account of the smaller amount of\r\ninconvenience it causes the patient, need not be insisted on. The latter\r\ninvolves a cutting operation not free from danger, as well as deep\r\nnarcosis, while the cystoscopic method is similar to a simple\r\ncatheterization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (Fig. 5) shows the instrument used by me for\r\ncystoscopic examination. It has been made by the Berlin instrument maker,\r\nHartwig, according to my instructions. The source of the light (Mignon\r\nlamp) is cemented in a silver capsule, which is screwed into the distal\r\nend of the cystoscope. This instrument is superior to that made by Leiter,\r\nthe Vienna instrument maker, because of its greater simplicity in\r\nconstruction, which allows the lamp to be easily replaced when necessary,\r\nand also on account of the greater length of the shaft.\r\n\r\nI mention this because it differs from the explanation which Mr. Fenwick\r\ngave in his speech concerning my method of examination at the meeting of\r\nthe Medical Society of London on Jan. 23, 1888. I must also strongly\r\ncontradict Mr. Fenwick's statements concerning the share which he\r\nattributed to the Vienna instrument maker in the construction of the\r\ninstrument. Leiter's connection with our instrument will be best explained\r\nwhen I say that he had to buy the patent[10] from me first in order to be\r\nallowed to make the instrument. Leiter has had no share in those\r\npeculiarities which characterize it as new. The introduction of the source\r\nof light into the organ had been practically brought about, the optical\r\napparatus enlarging the view designed, the whole construction perfected,\r\nthe instrument had proved itself useful in examining patients, and had\r\nbeen demonstrated by me in the Saechsisches Landes Medicinal Collegium\r\nbefore Leiter had any idea of the new invention! Also the eventual\r\nreplacement of the first source of light (platinum wire) had been provided\r\nfor.[11] Leiter has only made a few technical modifications on the\r\nfinished instrument. I protest most emphatically against the incorrect\r\nexplanations given by Mr. Fenwick, and against every connection of\r\nLeiter's name with my instruments. I hope to obtain in England the same\r\ngenerous recognition of my labors in this field that has been accorded to\r\nme in Germany.--_Lancet._\r\n\r\n[10] Deutsche Patentschrifte, No. 6, 853.\r\n\r\n[11] Ibid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            PAPILLOMATOUS TUMOR OF THE BLADDER, DEMONSTRATED BY\r\n                 MEANS OF LISTER'S ELECTRO-CYSTOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n    By F. N. Otis, M.D., Clinical Professor, College of Physicians and\r\n                           Surgeons, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. G----, aged twenty-three, United States; single; barber.\r\n\r\nThe young man was referred to me by his former medical attendant, March\r\n16, 1883. His urine was found to be slightly but distinctly tinged with\r\nblood, and contained some small clots as well as some pus and mucus. He\r\ncomplained of exquisite pain on urination, increased at the close,\r\nrecurring every half hour. Through examination per rectum (_a posteriori_)\r\nunusual tenderness was found. Distinct increase in the density and\r\nthickness of the right inferior section of the bladder was recognized by\r\nthe bimanual touch; a catheter was introduced, and three ounces of bloody\r\nurine removed. The bladder was then irrigated gently with a saturated\r\nsolution of boric acid until the fluid returned clear. The catheter was\r\nthen withdrawn, leaving about four ounces of the solution, of a\r\ntemperature of 80 deg., in the bladder, as a preparation for its examination\r\nby the electro-cystoscope of Lister. The required current was furnished by\r\nthe small six-cell battery of the Galvano-Faradic Co. The cystoscope was\r\nthen introduced into the bladder, and the current turned on. The\r\nillumination was complete. Through the slightly rosy medium the small\r\nblood vessels in the bladder mucous membrane were distinctly seen. On the\r\nright side a deep red, granular-looking mass, with a wavy outline, was\r\nthen distinctly observed, covering about one-fourth of the cystoscopic\r\nfield. This appearance was verified by Drs. Abbe, Bangs, and W. K.\r\nOtis--the unanimous opinion being that it represented a papillomatous\r\ngrowth, to some extent covered by coagulated blood. Two days later a\r\nsimilar examination was made, under the influence of an anaesthetic, which\r\ncorroborated the previous observations in every particular. (See\r\nillustration.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF BLADDER, SHOWING LOCATION OF TUMOR\r\nAND POSITION OF CYSTOSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nSome small filaments were subsequently removed with the lithotrite, but on\r\nmicroscopical examination nothing of diagnostic importance was discovered.\r\nFrom lack of the capacity of the bladder, the field was necessarily\r\nlimited, nevertheless, a very excellent view of the tumor could be\r\nobtained. This is shown in the illustration, from a sketch made at the\r\ntime of the first examination. It represents the position of the tumor and\r\ncystoscope when the best view of it was obtained.\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday the patient entered St. Luke's Hospital, and was\r\noperated upon by my associate, Dr. L. B. Bangs, Dr. Charles McBurney\r\nassisting. The high operation was performed, and the bladder being\r\nexamined by means of an electric light, introduced through the suprapubic\r\nincision, the diagnosis made by the cystoscope was verified in every\r\nparticular. The growth was then removed, as far as possible, with the\r\nscissors, and the surface cauterized with the Paquelin cautery. At the\r\npresent writing the patient is going on toward a satisfactory recovery.\r\nThe pathological examination made by Dr. Frank Ferguson, pathologist of\r\nSt. Luke's Hospital, showed the neoplasm to be a simple papilloma.\r\n\r\nThis case is deserving of especial interest as being the first tumor of\r\nthe bladder diagnosticated in this country by means of the cystoscope, and\r\nverified by subsequent operation, and adds one more to the list of\r\nsixteen cases so made out by foreign observers, and two by Dr. Fenwick, of\r\nEngland. In this instance the instrument deserves particular credit, as\r\nother methods had completely failed in the practice of competent\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\nThis consists of a metal tube, about seven inches long, of a caliber of 22\r\nFrench, having at the proximal end a funnel shaped ocular opening; at the\r\ndistal, a short beak, similar to that of the catheter coude. A window of\r\nrock crystal is set in the end of this beak, behind which a small electric\r\nlamp, controlled by a switch at the ocular end, is placed. A rectangular\r\nprism, the hypothenuse plane of which is silvered, is placed in the end of\r\nthe straight portion of the tube, its superior face being seen just\r\nanterior to the angle formed by the beak. The distended bladder is\r\nilluminated by the electric lamp, the rays reflected from its wall falling\r\non the prism experience total reflection, an inverted image being formed\r\nwithin the tube. The size of the field thus obtained is greatly increased\r\nby means of a telescope introduced into the tube. The image seen through\r\nthe cystoscope is an inverted image, but right and left are not\r\ntransposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CYSTOSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no question as to the great prospective value of the\r\nelectro-cystoscope in diagnosis of many difficulties to which the bladder\r\nis subject. A variety of foreign bodies have already been reported as made\r\nout by use of this instrument. The locality, size, and color of vesical\r\ncalculi have been demonstrated in my own experience. In one instance two\r\nstones were seen where only one had been previously found, but this of\r\ncourse might with care have been effected by means of the lithotrite. But\r\nit is in the diagnosis of the tumors, and encysted or impacted calculi,\r\nthat the most essential service may be anticipated from the use of the\r\ncystoscope. The orifices of the ureters are quite readily brought into the\r\ncystoscopic field, and it is more than probable that (perhaps through the\r\nintroduction of some clear fluid with which blood does not readily\r\nmingle--glycerine, for instance) the true source of a previously doubtful\r\nhaematuria will be demonstrated.--_Medical Record._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  DISTANCE AND CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo many queries about the solar system, or the members of it, have come\r\nrecently to the attention of those in charge of this journal, from various\r\nsources, that it is thought best to make a brief statement of the present\r\nstate of knowledge that astronomy has of the solar neighborhood in which\r\nwe live.\r\n\r\nNaturally we begin with the sun, and the oldest and most important problem\r\nwhich the study of this body offers is the determination of its distance\r\nfrom the earth in terrestrial units of measure. This distance is important\r\nbecause the knowledge of all the phenomena of all the heavenly bodies,\r\nexcept those of the moon, depend directly or indirectly on its value. The\r\nproblem of the sun's distance is difficult because the data given for\r\ndetermining it are insufficient to enable the astronomer to apply the\r\nprinciples of trigonometry directly to it. He is, therefore, compelled to\r\nuse indirect methods of solution, which, at best, give only approximations\r\nto the true distance, arising chiefly from small errors in observation,\r\nwhich, at the present time, seem unavoidable. A familiar illustration will\r\nmake our meaning clear. The knowledge we have of the sun's distance\r\ndepends on the accurate measurement of a small angle formed by drawing two\r\nlines from a point at the sun to the extremities of the earth's radius.\r\nThat angle is called the sun's parallax. Ptolemy thought that this angle\r\nwas 3' of arc, but we now know that its value is very near 8.80\" of arc,\r\nand that the error of this amount from the true angle probably is not more\r\nthan 0.02\". To measure this small angle has been the astronomer's great\r\ntrouble since the time of Aristarchus, and he does not yet know its value\r\naccurately. His problem is like that of a surveyor attempting to measure a\r\nball, whose real diameter is one foot, at the distance of 4.4 miles\r\nnearly; and unless he can determine the diameter of the ball so that he\r\nshall not be uncertain in his measure to the amount of 0.03 of an inch,\r\nhis work will not add anything useful to present knowledge.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the angle of parallax to be known, the computation of the\r\ndistance of a celestial body is easy. Multiply earth's radius by 206,265\r\n(seconds of arc in the unit radius), and divide the product by the angle\r\nof parallax in seconds of arc. The mean equatorial radius of the earth, as\r\ngiven in Clark's Geodesy, is 3963.3 English miles. The sun's distance for\r\na parallax of 8.78\" would be\r\n\r\n  206,265\" x 3963.3\r\n  -----------------  = 93,108,000 miles.\r\n        8.78\"\r\n\r\n  For parallax of 8.80\" = 92,897,000 miles.\r\n  For parallax of 8.82\" = 92,686,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe range of error in parallax, as here given, is 0.04\", and the change of\r\nthe distance of the sun in allowing for this error is nearly half a\r\nmillion of miles. If 8.80\" be the assumed parallax, with +- 0.02\" as\r\nprobable error, then the uncertainty of the sun's distance is still nearly\r\na quarter of a million of miles.\r\n\r\nSo far astronomers are pretty generally agreed, unless it be in the value\r\nof the earth's radius used above. In his excellent work, entitled \"The\r\nSun,\" we notice that Professor Young gives 3,962.72 English miles as the\r\n\"latest and most reliable determination\" (page 22), while he seems to use\r\nBessel's value of 3,962.80 in obtaining 92,885,000. This may be because\r\nthe last named value is still in most general use, though less accurate\r\nundoubtedly than that of Clarke.\r\n\r\nSince the transit of Venus, of 1874, the determination of the solar\r\nparallax has not been very much improved. The transit of 1882, so far as\r\nknown, has given surprisingly discordant results, and probably they will\r\nbe of very little service in improving our knowledge of the distance of\r\nthe sun. In the midst of all this uncertainty of late work, in ordinary\r\nmethods two ways of studying the problem show results almost exactly\r\nalike. They are obtained from late improved measures of the velocity of\r\nlight, and from measures by the heliometer. The parallax from these\r\nsources is 8.794\". The Brazilian results of transit of Venus for 1882, by\r\nWolf and Andre, recently published, make the parallax 8.808\". The American\r\nreductions for the last transit are not yet completed.\r\n\r\nFrom the above brief statement of results, it seems that the value of the\r\nsolar parallax is likely to be a trifle under 8.80\", rather than above it,\r\nmaking the distance of the sun probably very near 93,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe next most important problem pertaining to the sun is its constitution,\r\nwhich is usually considered under four heads:\r\n\r\n1. The central portion, thought to be made up chiefly of intensely heated\r\ngases.\r\n\r\n2. That part which is seen by the aid of the telescope, called the\r\nphotosphere, consisting of a \"shell of luminous clouds formed by the\r\ncooling and condensation of the condensible vapors at the surface where\r\nexposed to the cold of outer space.\" (Young.)\r\n\r\n3. Outside of the photosphere is a shallow stratum, called the\r\nchromosphere, \"composed mainly of uncondensible gases (conspicuously\r\nhydrogen) left behind by the formation of the photospheric clouds, and\r\nbearing something the same relation to them that the oxygen and nitrogen\r\nof our own atmosphere do to our own clouds.\" (Young.) And--\r\n\r\n4. The corona, which is the beautiful halo seen, with the naked eye,\r\noutside of all, during the time of a total eclipse of the sun. This\r\ncurious halo with all its streamers and rifts is thought to be composed\r\nchiefly of an incandescent material, in a far more attenuated state than\r\nthat of hydrogen, the rarest gas known, because it yields freely in the\r\nspectroscope a certain line, 1474 K, which most agree can mean nothing\r\nelse, although no one knows what the gas or metallic vapor is. Hydrogen is\r\nalso found in the corona extending to the height of 600,000 miles above\r\nthe photosphere, and possibly 1,200,000 miles. Suspended in this mixture\r\nof vapors, and \"falling into, or projected from, the sun is a large\r\nquantity of solid or liquid material, which is at such a temperature as to\r\nbe self-luminous. It is this which yields the continuous spectrum, free\r\nfrom dark lines.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these components in the outer envelope, there is present matter\r\nwhich reflects or diffuses light much as our own atmosphere does.\r\n\r\n\"To this is attributed the partial radial polarization of the corona. The\r\nstreamers and rifts indicate matter repelled, in various quantities, from\r\nthe sun by forces which may be electrical.\" (Hastings.)\r\n\r\nThese are the views advanced by astronomers and physicists, as theories or\r\nworking hypotheses, until something better or more certain can be known.\r\nThey are not held as facts by any, because of insufficient proof to\r\nestablish them as such, and because there are very grave objections to\r\nsome of them which are at present unanswerable.\r\n\r\nFor example, the spectroscope shows that the gaseous pressure at the limit\r\nof the chromosphere is very small, although that is at the base of an\r\natmosphere from 600,000 to 1,200,000 miles deep, and under the influence\r\nof a force of gravity more than twenty-seven times as great as that in\r\naction at the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nOptically, the atmosphere of the earth ceases at a height of forty-five\r\nmiles, but bodies at twice that altitude, moving at the rate of\r\ntwenty-seven miles per second, meet resistance of air enough to render\r\nthem incandescent almost instantly. But the evidence seems clear that, far\r\nwithin the corona, the resistance to moving bodies is much less than in\r\nour atmosphere at a height of sixty miles. The great comet of 1882 passed\r\nthrough the coronal atmosphere within 300,000 miles of the sun, with a\r\nvelocity one hundred and eighty times that of the earth in its orbit. The\r\ncomet was not stopped, nor destroyed, nor its orbit disturbed, as\r\nsubsequent observations showed. The same thing was true, so far as known,\r\nof the comet of 1843, which passed still nearer the solar surface. These\r\nfacts are troublesome to explain on the hypothesis of a coronal\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nStill further: if the sun be surrounded by a gaseous envelope, its\r\ndensity, as aforesaid, ought to diminish from the solar surface outward to\r\nits upper limits; but the fact is, the material of 1474 K line always\r\nappears in the spectrum of chromosphere, which would seem to indicate, by\r\nits place, that it is as much more dense than hydrogen as is magnesium\r\nvapor, or even the vapor of iron. But the evidence of the spectroscope\r\nmakes this 1474 K material far less dense than that of hydrogen, and this\r\nis a contradiction that is very troublesome to the student of solar\r\nphysics.\r\n\r\nIn studying the polarization of the light of the corona, it is clear that\r\nthe amount of polarized light reflected from a particle at the surface of\r\nthe sun is nothing, \"because the luminous source there is a surface with\r\nan angular subtense of 180 deg.;\" hence polarization of the corona near the\r\nlimb of the moon ought to be small, farther away, larger. But observation\r\nshows that the contrary is true, _i. e._, the percent. of polarized light\r\nincreases as the corona is observed nearer the limb of the moon during\r\ntotality.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the difficult questions that stand in the way of\r\naccepting the foregoing theories as facts pertaining to, or well grounded\r\nknowledge of, the constitution of the sun. They are by no means all, or\r\npossibly the most important ones. They are certainly among those that are\r\nreceiving very general attention at the hands of physicists at the present\r\ntime.--_Sidereal Messenger._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CHANGES IN THE STELLAR HEAVENS.\r\n\r\n   By J. E. GORE, F.R.A.S., Honorary Associate and Vice-President of the\r\n                     Liverpool Astronomical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we look up at the starry heavens on a clear, moonless night, all seems\r\nstill, lifeless, and devoid of energy and motion. All of us are--or at\r\nleast should be--familiar with the apparent diurnal motion of the star\r\nsphere, caused by the actual rotation of the earth on its axis, and with\r\nthe slower annual motion, due to the earth's revolution round the sun,\r\nwhich brings different constellations into view at different seasons of\r\nthe year. These motions, due to the great and universal law of\r\ngravitation, discovered and so ably expounded by the famous Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, are of course wonderful and orderly in their regularity, and bear\r\nsilent testimony to the amazing power, majesty, and goodness of a great\r\nand glorious Creator. There are, however, other motions and changes, even\r\nstill more wonderful, going on in the depths of space, which, though\r\nunperceived by the ordinary observer, have been revealed to the eye and\r\ncontemplation of the astronomer by the accurate instruments and methods of\r\nresearch which modern science has placed at his disposal. Some accounts of\r\nthese marvelous discoveries may prove of interest to the reader. The\r\n\"fixed stars\" are so called because they apparently hold a fixed position\r\nwith reference to each other on the concave surface of the celestial\r\nvault, and do not, as far as the unaided eye can judge, change their\r\nrelative positions as the planets do. Many stars have, however, what is\r\ntechnically called a \"proper motion,\" which, though of course very minute,\r\nand only to be detected by the aid of refined and accurate instruments,\r\nyet accumulate in the course of ages, and sensibly alter their position in\r\nthe sky. The largest \"proper motion\" hitherto detected (about seven\r\nseconds of arc per annum) is that of a small star in the constellation\r\nUrsa Major, known to astronomers as No. 1830 of Groonbridge's catalogue.\r\nIt has been calculated that this star is rushing through space with the\r\namazing and almost inconceivable velocity of 200 miles per second!--a\r\nvelocity which would carry it from the earth to the sun in about 5-1/2 days\r\nand to the moon in 20 minutes! The well-known double star 61 Cygni has a\r\nproper motion of about five seconds of arc per annum, both components\r\nmoving through space together. This is, as far as yet known, the nearest\r\nstar to the earth in the northern hemisphere. Its parallax, as determined\r\nby Sir R. S. Ball, is 0.4676 of a second of arc, and by Prof. Pritchard\r\n(by photography) 0.43 of a second. Taking the mean of these values, its\r\ndistance from the earth would be about 460,000 times the earth's mean\r\ndistance from the sun, and its actual velocity about 33 miles per second.\r\nThis is, of course, the motion at right angles to the line of sight, but\r\nas it may also have a motion _in_ the line of sight, either to or from the\r\neye, its real velocity is probably greater than this. The remarkable\r\ntriple star 40 Eridani has a proper motion of four seconds annually. The\r\ncomponents are a fourth magnitude star accompanied by a distant double\r\ncompanion which is a binary (or revolving double star), and accompanies\r\nthe bright star in its flight through space. There are two other faint and\r\ndistant companions which do not partake in the motion of the ternary star.\r\nIn the year 1864 the bright star was situated to the east of a line\r\njoining these faint companions, but owing to its large proper motion it is\r\nnow to the west of them. In the case of the triple star Struve 1516, one\r\nof the companions, which was to the west of the primary star in 1831, is,\r\nowing to the proper motion of the bright star, now to the east of it.\r\nProf. Asaph Hall has found a parallax for 40 Eridani of 0.223 of a second.\r\nThis, combined with the observed proper motion, indicates an actual\r\nvelocity of about 54 miles per second. The star Mu Cassiopeiae has also a\r\nlarge proper motion. This star, about 4,000 years ago, must have been\r\nclose to Alpha Cassiopeiae, and might have been so seen by the ancient\r\nastronomers. The proper motion of the bright star Arcturus is so\r\nconsiderable that in the course of about 30,000 years it will be near the\r\nequator, and about 10 deg. to the north of the bright star Spica, from which\r\nit is at present separated by over 30 deg. These motions are of course those\r\nwhich take place across the face of the sky. There are, however, motions\r\nin the line of sight--both toward and from the eye--which have of late\r\nyears been revealed to us by the spectroscope, that wonderful instrument\r\nof modern scientific research, by the aid of which several new metals have\r\nbeen discovered, and which has been found so useful in chemical analysis,\r\nand even in the manufacture of steel by the Bessemer process. Some years\r\nsince, Dr. Huggins, the eminent spectroscopist, found that the bright star\r\nSirius, \"the monarch of the skies,\" was receding from the earth at the\r\nrate of about 20 miles a second. Later observations at Greenwich\r\nObservatory showed that this motion was gradually diminishing, and within\r\nthe last few years it has been found that the motion of recession has been\r\nactually changed into a motion of approach, showing that this giant sun is\r\nprobably traveling in a mighty orbit round some as yet unknown center of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of stellar proper motions, it has been concluded that\r\nthe sun--and therefore the whole solar system--is moving through space.\r\nRecent investigations make the velocity of translation about 19 miles per\r\nsecond (30 kilometers). The Greenwich observations place the \"apex of the\r\nsolar motion\" (as the point toward which the sun is moving is called)\r\nbetween Rho and Sigma Cygni, while Dr. Huggins' results fix a point near\r\nBeta Cephei. Both these points are near the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThere are other startling changes which have occasionally taken place\r\namong the stars, and which must be looked upon almost in the light of\r\ncatastrophes. At rare intervals in the history of astronomy \"temporary\" or\r\n\"new\" stars have suddenly blazed out in the heavens which were previously\r\neither unknown to astronomers, or else were invisible, except in the\r\ntelescope. Some of these were of great brilliancy. In A.D. 173 a bright\r\nstar is recorded in the Chinese annals as having appeared between Alpha\r\nand Beta Centauri (two bright stars in the southern hemisphere). It\r\nremained visible for seven or eight months, and is described as resembling\r\n\"a large bamboo mat\" (!)--a not very lucid description. It is worthy of\r\nremark that there exists at the present time, close to the spot indicated,\r\nan interesting variable star, which may possibly be identical with the\r\nbright star of the second century. Perhaps the most remarkable of these\r\nwonderful objects was that observed by the famous Tycho Brahe in 1572, in\r\nCassiopeia, and called the \"Pilgrim.\" It was so brilliant that it rivaled\r\nthe planet Venus at its brightest, and was visible at noonday. It remained\r\nvisible for over a year and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nA small star close to its recorded position has been observed in recent\r\nyears, and as it is thought to be slightly variable in its light, it may\r\npossibly be identical with the long lost star of Tycho Brahe. Another new\r\nstar of almost equal brilliancy was observed in October, 1604, in\r\nOphiuchus, a few degrees southeast of the star Eta Ophiuchi. The planets\r\nMars, Jupiter, and Saturn were close together in this vicinity, and one\r\nevening Mostlin, a pupil of Kepler's, remarked that a new and very\r\nbrilliant star had joined the group. When first seen it was white, and\r\nexceeded in brightness Mars and Jupiter, and was even thought to rival\r\nVenus in splendor! It gradually diminished, however, and in six months was\r\nnot equal in luster to Saturn; in March, 1606, it had entirely\r\ndisappeared. In 1670 a star of the third magnitude was observed by Anthelm\r\nnear Beta Cygni. It remained visible for about two years, and increased\r\nand diminished several times before it finally disappeared. Flamsteed's\r\nstar, No. 11 of Vulpecula, has been supposed to be identical with\r\nAnthelm's star, but Baily could not find that such a star exists. A small\r\nstar has, however, been observed at Greenwich within one minute of arc of\r\nthe place assigned to the temporary star by Picard's observations.\r\n\r\nVariability has been suspected in this faint star, and according to Hind\r\nit has a hazy, ill-defined appearance about it, which may perhaps suggest\r\nthat it may be a small planetary nebula, similar to Schmidt's new star of\r\n1876 in Cygnus. A small new star was observed by Hind in Ophiuchus on\r\nApril 28, 1848. When first noticed it was about the fifth magnitude. It\r\nafterward rose to about fourth magnitude, but very soon faded away, and,\r\nalthough still visible in the telescope, has become very faint in recent\r\nyears. A new star of seventh magnitude was found by Pogson on May 28,\r\n1860, in the well-known star cluster known as 80 Messier in Scorpio. The\r\nlight of the star when first seen obscured the light of the nebula. On\r\nJune 10 the star had nearly disappeared, and the nebula was again seen\r\nshining with great brilliancy.\r\n\r\nA very interesting temporary star--known as the \"Blaze Star\"--suddenly\r\nappeared in Corona Borealis in May, 1866. It was first seen by the late\r\nMr. Birmingham, of Tuam, Ireland, on the night of May 12, when it was of\r\nthe second magnitude and equal in brightness to Alphecca, the brightest\r\nstar in the well-known \"Coronet.\" It must have made its appearance very\r\nsuddenly, for Dr. Schmidt, the director of the Athens observatory, stated\r\nthat he was observing this region of the heavens a few hours previously,\r\nand noticed nothing unusual. It rapidly diminished in brightness, and on\r\nMay 24 of the same year was reduced to nearly the ninth magnitude. It was\r\nsoon discovered that the star had been previously observed, and its place\r\nregistered by the great German astronomer, Argelander, as of magnitude 9-1/2,\r\nso that it is possibly a variable star of irregular period and fitful\r\nvariability. When near its maximum brilliancy, its light was examined by\r\nDr. Huggins with the spectroscope, which showed the bright lines of\r\nincandescent hydrogen gas in addition to the ordinary stellar spectrum.\r\nThis implies that the great increase in its light was due to a sudden\r\noutburst of hydrogen in the star's atmosphere. Some observers remarked\r\nthat when viewed with the naked eye it decidedly twinkled more than other\r\nstars in the neighborhood, which rendered a correct estimate of its\r\nrelative brightness somewhat difficult. During the years 1866 to 1876,\r\nSchmidt detected variations of light which seemed to show a period of\r\nabout 94 days, and these observations were confirmed by Schonfeld.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 24, 1876, the late Dr. Schmidt, of Athens,\r\ndiscovered a new star of the third magnitude, near Rho Cygni, in a spot\r\nwhere he was certain that no bright star was visible four nights\r\npreviously. When first seen, it was somewhat brighter than Eta Pegasi. It\r\ndid not, however, remain long at this degree of brightness, but rapidly\r\ndecreased, and on November 30 had faded to fifth magnitude. It afterward\r\ndiminished very regularly, and in September, 1885, was estimated only\r\nfifteenth magnitude with the 15-1/2 inch refractor of Mr. Wigglesworth's\r\nobservatory. The star was examined with the spectroscope a few days after\r\nits discovery, and showed bright lines similar to the \"Blaze Star\" in the\r\nNorthern Crown. One of these bright lines was believed to be identical\r\nwith Kirchhoff's No. 1474, which has been observed in the spectrum of the\r\nsolar corona during total eclipses of the sun. This star would seem to be\r\nquite new, as there is no star in any of the catalogues in its position.\r\nIn September, 1877, it was examined with the spectroscope at Lord\r\nCrawford's observatory, and its light was found to be almost entirely\r\nmonochromatic (of only one color), showing that the star \"had changed into\r\na planetary nebula of small angular diameter\" (!)\r\n\r\nIn August, 1885, a star of about seventh magnitude made its appearance\r\nclose to the nucleus of the Great Nebula in Andromeda--a well-known object\r\nvisible to the naked eye, and which has been well called \"the Queen of the\r\nNebulae.\" The new star was independently discovered by several observers\r\ntoward the end of August, but seems to have been first certainly seen by\r\nMr. T. W. Ward, of Belfast, on August 19, at 11 P.M. At Greenwich\r\nobservatory the spectrum of the new star was found \"of precisely the same\r\ncharacter as that of the nebula, _i. e._, it was perfectly continuous, no\r\nlines, either bright or dark, being visible, and the red end was wanting.\"\r\nDr. Huggins, however, on September 9, thought he could see from three to\r\nfive bright lines in its spectrum. The star gradually faded away, and on\r\nFebruary 7, 1886, was estimated only sixteenth magnitude in the 26 inch\r\nrefractor of the naval observatory at Washington. From a series of\r\nmeasures by Prof. Asaph Hall he found \"no certain indications of any\r\nparallax,\" so that evidently the star and the nebula, in which it probably\r\nlies, are situated at an immense distance from the earth. Prof. Seeliger\r\nhas investigated the decrease in light of the star on the hypothesis that\r\nit was a cooling body, which had been suddenly raised to an intense heat\r\nby the shock of a collision, and finds a fair agreement between theory and\r\nobservation. Anwers points out the similarity between this outburst and\r\nthe new star of 1860 in the cluster 80 Messier, and thinks it very\r\nprobable that both phenomena were due to physical changes in the nebulae in\r\nwhich they occurred.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the colors of the stars, some of the red stars have been\r\nsuspected to vary in color. The bright star Sirius is supposed--from the\r\ndescription of it by ancient astronomers--to have been originally red, but\r\nthis seems very doubtful. The Persian astronomer Al Sufi, in his\r\n\"Description of the Heavens,\" written in the tenth century, describes the\r\nwell-known variable star Algol distinctly as a red star. It is now white,\r\nand this is perhaps the best attested instance on record of change of\r\ncolor in a bright star.--_Naturalists' Monthly._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE COMMON DANDELION.\r\n\r\n                      By FREDERICK LEROY SARGENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the various names which the dandelion has received, we see expressed,\r\nfor the most part, either a reference to the tooth-like recurved lobes of\r\nthe leaves, Fig. 1, or an allusion to the medicinal properties of the\r\nplant. Thus, our English name is a modified form of the French _dent de\r\nlion_, meaning lion's tooth, and in German we have the same idea expressed\r\nin _Loewenzahn_. Fifty years ago this plant appeared in the botanies as\r\n_Leontodon taraxicum_, the generic name being derived from the Greek\r\n_leon_, lion, and _odons_, tooth, and the specific from the Greek\r\n_tarasso_, to stir up, in reference to the effect of a dose. In later\r\nworks we find the genus _Leontodon_, including the \"fall dandelion\" (_L.\r\nautumnale_), but not the true dandelion, which now appears in a genus by\r\nitself under the name _Taraxicum Densleonis_. Here the specific name is\r\nmerely \"lion's tooth\" again, in Latin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nFinally, in the latest works our plant is given as _Taraxicum officinale_,\r\nsince this has been found to be the name which, according to the rules of\r\nbotanical nomenclature, takes precedence of all others. An allusion to the\r\nteeth is thus no longer retained, the only reference remaining being to\r\nthe plant's officinal use.\r\n\r\nTo the majority of people the mention of the dandelion calls to mind not\r\nso much its medicinal properties as its use for food. Although its\r\ncultivation, either as a spring pot herb or as a salad with blanched\r\nleaves, is comparatively modern, the wild plant seems to have been long\r\nvalued as a vegetable. There is reason to believe that the Romans made use\r\nof it as a pot herb, and Chinese writers of the fourteenth century mention\r\nits being eaten in their country, although there is no evidence of\r\ncultivation at that time.\r\n\r\nThere are but few of our flowering plants that grow so widespread over the\r\nworld. It occurs in North America from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast,\r\nin Europe, in Asia, and in the Arctic regions. This extensive range may in\r\npart be accounted for by the fact that our plant belongs to the large and\r\naggressive family of the _Compositae_, and is thus related to such invaders\r\nas daisies, burdocks, and thistles. Still, the dandelion has more to\r\nrecommend it than mere family connection; for, despite its lowly aspect,\r\nit is no poor relation, but, as we shall hope to show in the present\r\narticle, it has many virtues of its own which entitle it to respect.\r\n\r\nProminent among these is its adaptability to the different conditions\r\nunder which it grows. It seems to make the best of everything. If by\r\nchance a seed falls upon poor, thin soil, the young plant sends forth, as\r\nrapidly as possible, a rosette of leaves pressed close to the earth. And\r\nthus, on the principle that \"possession is nine points of the law,\" it\r\nsecures for its roots the use of a certain amount of territory quite safe\r\nfrom the encroachments of other plants. In rich ground the case is quite\r\ndifferent, for here there is so much nutriment in a small quantity of\r\nearth, that the struggle for soil is not such a life and death matter as\r\nin the less favored localities. Consequently we find a large number of\r\nplants crowded together as close as they can stand; and it is obvious that\r\nif, under these circumstances, the dandelion should develop a flat rosette\r\nof leaves, the grass and other plants growing around would soon overshadow\r\nit, and it would have small chance for life.\r\n\r\nOur plant, therefore, extends its leaves upward, and does its best to\r\nelongate them so as to keep pace with the growth of its rivals. But as\r\nthese are for the most part grasses and plants which grow by elongation of\r\nthe stem, the race for sunshine is rather in favor of these other plants,\r\nfor the reason that a given amount of material put into a stem makes a\r\nstiffer organ than when put into a leaf. Still, even with these odds\r\nagainst it, the dandelion seems well able to hold its own, for it probably\r\nderives more or less advantage from the recurved lobes, or teeth, which\r\ngive the plant its name. These are admirably fitted to act in much the\r\nsame manner as a ratchet; and when the neighboring grasses are blown\r\nagainst the dandelion, a blade may slide along the margin of the leaf\r\ntoward the base; but, as it springs back from its own elasticity, it\r\ncannot slide in the opposite direction, for a tooth will catch it, and\r\nthus force it to help support the leaf, and hold it up to the sunshine. We\r\nneed not stop to consider how the dandelion behaves in soil which is\r\nneither very rich nor very poor, for enough has been said to show that it\r\nhas not much to fear from any rivals it may meet under ordinary\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not only against the aggressions of neighboring plants, however,\r\nthat our dandelion needs to be prepared. It is at least equally important\r\nfor its welfare that it have some means of protection against herbivorous\r\nanimals--not only such as might eat its leaves, but also the more stealthy\r\nones that live upon the food which plants store underground. All such foes\r\nit thwarts by a means as simple as it is efficient. Every part of the\r\nplant contains a milky juice which is intensely bitter, and a first taste\r\nis quite enough to convince the most stupid animal that raw dandelion is\r\nnot good eating, and most animals know enough to let it severely alone.\r\nCuriously enough, however, in this, as in many other cases, it happens\r\nthat what in nature acts to deter animals from eating the plant, with man\r\noffers the chief attraction, for it is this very bitter principle\r\n(_taraxacin_) which gives to dandelion greens their peculiar flavor, and\r\naffords the essential element in the extract which physicians prescribe.\r\n\r\nThe store of food, referred to above, which the dandelion accumulates in\r\nits root, not infrequently enables it to pass, almost unharmed, through\r\ndangers that with less provident plants would surely prove fatal. For\r\nexample, it must often happen that from drought or from being trampled\r\nupon by animals, the leaves become wholly or in part destroyed. Now, if\r\nthere were no reserve store of food, the plant would have no chance of\r\nrallying; but as it is, this food supplies the material for new growth,\r\nand upon the return of favorable conditions, fresh leaves are developed,\r\nand the plant lives on as before. Primarily, of course, the purpose of\r\nthis storage of food is to enable the plant to live on from year to year,\r\nresting in the winter, and in the spring beginning work again with a good\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the higher with the lower plants, the superiority of the\r\nformer is most beautifully shown in the better provision which is made for\r\nthe welfare of offspring; and in this regard our dandelion stands among\r\nthe highest. Before we can understand the ways in which our little plant\r\nperforms this part of its life work, we must briefly consider the\r\nstructure of the blossom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIf with a sharp knife we cut a blossom in halves, from the stem upward,\r\nthe parts represented in Fig. 2 will be disclosed. Surmounting the stalk\r\nis a cushion-like receptacle, R, from the top of which arise a number of\r\ntiny flowers, F, while from the side grow out a series of green scales, S,\r\nforming an involucre around the whole. A single one of these florets, Fig.\r\n3, exhibits the following parts: First, a bright yellow corolla, C O,\r\ntubular below, but strap-shaped above, as if a tube had been split for\r\npart of the way on one side, and the upper part flattened. Second, five\r\nstamens, S K, attached by slender filaments, F M, to the tubular part of\r\nthe corolla, and with their anthers or pollen sacs, A N, joined together\r\nby the edges to form a tube. Third, a single pistil having a long style, S\r\nY, which, above, passes through the anther tube, and bears at its end two\r\ndiverging stigmas, S G, and below connects by a short neck, N, with the\r\nsmall ovary, O, which contains a solitary ovule. Fourth, a calyx, C X,\r\ncomposed of numerous slender bristles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these complex structures is, of course, in one way or\r\nanother to secure the development of the ovule into a seed fitted to\r\nproduce a new plant. This development will proceed only after the ovule\r\nhas been influenced (_i. e._, fertilized) by pollen placed upon the\r\nstigma; but when once the mysterious process of fertilization has taken\r\nplace, then there follows immediately those wonderful changes in the\r\nblossom which culminate in the ripening of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThere are but two possible ways in which fertilization may be secured;\r\neither the pollen which affects the ovule must come from the same flower\r\n(then called close fertilization), or the pollen must come from another\r\nflower of the same kind (cross fertilization). Now, while either of these\r\nmethods will insure the production of a seed, numerous experiments go to\r\nshow that those offspring which result from cross fertilization are in\r\nmany ways superior to those which are produced from close fertilization;\r\nand it is to the advantages of cross fertilization that we have to look\r\nfor an explanation of the significance of many peculiar structures, not\r\nonly of the dandelion, but of flowers in general.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that, to secure cross fertilization, there must be some\r\nagent to transfer the pollen from one plant to another. Most commonly,\r\neither the wind is taken advantage of for this purpose, as with elms,\r\npines, grasses, etc., or else flying insects are induced to perform the\r\noffice, as is the case with the majority of our familiar flowers. The wind\r\nis a very wasteful carrier, so that for every grain that is properly\r\nplaced, thousands, or even millions, may be lost. Insects, on the\r\ncontrary, waste but little; and, moreover, as Aristotle so shrewdly\r\nobserved, they habitually confine their visits, for a number of trips,\r\nexclusively to the flowers of one species.\r\n\r\nThe dandelion seems to fully appreciate the great advantages of securing\r\nthe services of insects, for it appeals most strongly to their love of\r\nbright colors and their passion for sweets. As the flowers open, each tiny\r\ngolden cup is filled to the brim with purest nectar, and he must be a very\r\ndull insect, indeed, that cannot see the brilliant head of flowers as far\r\nas he can see anything. At any rate, it is not the dandelion's fault if he\r\ndoes not, for the blossom is placed where it will be as conspicuous as\r\npossible. If the surrounding herbage is tall, the flower stalk is\r\nelongated, so that the crown of flowers may not be obscured. If the plants\r\naround are low-lying, it would be wasteful to have a long stalk, so it has\r\na short one, sometimes so short that the blossom looks like a button in\r\nthe center of the leaf rosette. Economy of material is furthermore shown\r\nin the fact that the stalk is always hollow, for it is a principle well\r\nknown to builders that, when there is required a pillar of a given\r\nstrength, less material is needed for the tubular form than for the solid\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to our flower. We have next to consider how the visits of\r\ninsects are utilized to secure cross fertilization. If we examine the\r\nanther tube of a flower that has just opened, Fig. 4, we shall see that\r\nthe style has not yet protruded, but fills the entire cavity, except such\r\nspace as is occupied by a quantity of pollen which the anthers have shed.\r\nSo much of the style as is within the tube is thickly beset with hairs\r\nthat point upward; and when the lower portion elongates, this hairy part\r\nbrushes the pollen out of the tube, and protrudes, covered with the yellow\r\ndust, Fig. 5. At this stage, an insect coming for nectar must rub against\r\nthe style, and so become more or less covered with pollen. None of it,\r\nhowever, can get upon the stigmas, for they are not yet exposed. After a\r\nshort time has elapsed, during which much of the pollen has probably been\r\nrubbed off, the style is seen to split at the top; and as the halves\r\nseparate and roll back, Fig. 3, their inner faces (the stigmas) are\r\nexposed. If, now, the flower be visited by an insect which has previously\r\nbeen to a younger flower, the pollen he brings will be deposited upon the\r\nstigmas as he rubs against them, and cross fertilization will be effected.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, however, that no insect visits the blossom--and this must\r\noften happen to such as appear very early in the spring or late in the\r\nfall, when hardly any insects are around. In such cases we find that seeds\r\nare produced, and therefore we must infer that fertilization has in some\r\nway or other been secured. An examination of a flower still older than any\r\nwe have considered, Fig. 6, will show us what takes place. Here it will be\r\nseen that, after the stigmas have diverged, they continue to roll back,\r\nuntil a coil of one or more turns has been made; and as a result of this\r\nthe stigmatic surface comes in contact with the hairs on the style, and\r\ntouches the pollen grains entangled by them. Still, the close\r\nfertilization thus accomplished is only a last resort, and it can only\r\noccur in the event of insects' visits having failed; for when pollen from\r\nanother flower has once fallen on the stigma, no pollen coming afterward\r\ncan have the least effect. Thus, we have another instance of the\r\ndandelion's ability to make the best of its surroundings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nIt even adapts itself to the weather; for when the sun shines, the scales\r\nof the involucre bend back, and the blossom is expanded to its fullest\r\nextent; but in dull weather, or at night, the scales bend inward, and the\r\nblossom is tightly closed. The advantages of this remarkable movement,\r\nwith its implied sensitiveness, is obvious when we consider that insects\r\nare abroad only in sunshine, while at other times there is danger of dew\r\nor rain getting into the nectar, and so spoiling it for the insects.\r\n\r\nAfter fertilization has been accomplished throughout the blossom, the\r\ninvolucre closes, and remains closed during the ripening of the fruit. The\r\nchanges which now take place are as follows: In each flower the corolla,\r\nstamens, and style, being of no further use, wither, and sever their\r\nconnection with the ovary; the ovule develops into a seed containing a\r\ntiny plantlet well provided with food for its use during germination; the\r\novary grows to keep pace with the seed, its tissues become hardened, and a\r\nnumber of spine-like projections develop near the upper part; and finally\r\nthe short neck which bears the calyx bristles elongates, pushing upward\r\nthe withered parts of the flower. At this stage the involucral scales bend\r\nback through an arc of about 180 deg., the cushion-like receptacle becomes\r\nalmost spherically convex, the fruits radiate in all directions, the\r\nbristles spread, and a beautiful cluster of little parachutes is presented\r\nto the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nEven a glance at one of these fruits, Fig. 7, is sufficient to discover a\r\nwonderful fitness for transportation by wind, and more careful study shows\r\nthat this fitness pervades every detail. For example, on examining the\r\nbristles microscopically, Fig. 8, it is shown that they are not simple\r\nthreads, but each is hollow and has numerous projections extending on\r\neither side, all of which serves to increase the buoyancy in a very\r\neffective way.\r\n\r\nThe experience of aeronauts has shown that a highly important part in the\r\nequipment of a balloon, after the attainment of buoyancy, is the provision\r\nof some means of arresting the balloon's progress when the destination has\r\nbeen reached. One of the most successful means which they employ is the\r\ngrappling hook; and as we find the base of our diminutive parachute\r\nprovided with a number of upwardly directed spines, it seems fair to\r\nconclude that these serve to arrest the fruit upon favorable soil. If it\r\ncomes to rest upon a smooth surface--which, of course, would be\r\nbarren--the next breeze would easily blow it away; but if it chance to\r\nfall on soil or among other plants, the effect of the spines would be to\r\nretain it against the power of even a strong wind. Thus, we may leave it\r\nsafely landed upon good soil, ready to begin under favorable conditions\r\nthe cycle of its wonderful life.--_Popular Science News._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  SYSTEMATIC RELATIONS OF PLATYPSYLLUS, AS DETERMINED BY THE LARVA.[12]\r\n\r\n                          By DR. C. V. RILEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is always a great deal of interest attaching to organisms which are\r\nunique in character and which systematists find difficulty in placing in\r\nany of their schemes of classification. A number of instances will occur\r\nto every working naturalist, and I need only refer to Limulus, and the\r\nextensive literature devoted, during the past decade, to the discussion of\r\nits true position, as a marked and well-known illustration. In hexapods\r\nthe common earwig and flea are familiar illustrations. These osculant or\r\naberrant forms occur most among parasitic groups, as the Stylopidae,\r\nHippoboscidae, Pulicidae, Mallophaga, etc. Probably no hexapod, however, has\r\nmore interested entomologists than _Platypsyllus castoris_ Ritsema, a\r\nparasite of the beaver. I cannot better illustrate the diversity of\r\nopinion respecting its true position in zoology than by giving an epitome\r\nof the more important literature upon it.\r\n\r\n[12] Read at the meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, April 20,\r\n1888.\r\n\r\nJ. Ritsema, in _Petites Nouvelles Entomologiques_ for September 15, 1869,\r\ndescribed the species as _Platypsyllus castoris_. He found it on some\r\nAmerican beavers (_Castor canadensis_) in the zoological garden of\r\nRotterdam. He considered it to \"undoubtedly\" belong to the Suctoria of De\r\nGeer, and to form a new genus of Pulicidae.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, in the _Tijdschrift voor Entomologie_, 2d ser., vol. v.,\r\np. 185 (which I have not seen), the same author publishes what is\r\napparently a redescription of the insect. He gives his views more fully as\r\nto its systematic position, considering that it belongs to the\r\nAphaniptera, and is equivalent to the Pulicidae.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, Prof. J. O. Westwood (having previously read a\r\ndescription of the species, November 9, 1868, before the Ashmolean Society\r\nof Oxford) published in the _Entomologist's Monthly Magazine_, vol. vi.,\r\nOctober, 1869, pp. 118-119, a full characterization of the insect under\r\nthe name of _Platypsyllus castorinus_. A new order, _Achreioptera_, is\r\nestablished upon the species, which he very aptly likens, in general\r\nappearance, to a cross between a flattened flea and a diminutive\r\ncockroach. \"The abnormal economy of the insect, its remarkable structure,\r\nthe apparent want of mandibles, our ignorance of its transformations, and\r\nthe possibility that the creature may be homomorphous in the larva and\r\npupa states,\" are the reasons assigned for establishing the new order, and\r\nhere Prof. Westwood is perfectly consistent, as in his famous\r\n\"Introduction to the Classification of Insects\" the Forficulidae are placed\r\nin the order Euplexoptera; the Thripidae in the order Thysanoptera; the\r\nPhryganeidae in the order Thrichoptera; the Stylopidae in the order\r\nStrepsiptera; and the Pulicidae in the order Aphaniptera.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, Dr. J. L. Le Conte published his paper \"On _Platypsyllidae_, a New\r\nFamily of Coleoptera\" (Proc. Zool. Soc. of London for 1872, pp. 779-804,\r\npl. lxviii.), in which he shows that _Platypsylla_ is undoubtedly\r\ncoleopterous and cannot possibly be referred to the Aphaniptera. Careful\r\ndescriptions and figures of anatomical details are given, and he finds\r\nthat its affinities are very composite, but in the direction of the\r\nAdephagous and Clavicorn series. Its most convenient place is shown to be\r\nbetween the _Hydrophilidae_ and _Leptinidae_. There seems to be no good\r\nreason why the name _Platypsyllus_ is here changed to _Platypsylla_, a\r\nspelling adopted by most subsequent American writers.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, Prof. Westwood, in the \"_Thesaurus Entomologicus Oxoniensis_\"\r\n(Oxford, 1874), p. 194, pl. xxxvii., gives figures with details; reprints\r\nhis previous diagnosis, and maintains his previous course in erecting a\r\nnew order for the insect, without giving any additional reasons.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, P. Megnin, in \"Les Parasites et les maladies parasitaires,\" etc.,\r\nParis, 1880, gives (pp. 66-67) a description of the family\r\n\"Platypsyllines\" without expressing an opinion concerning the systematic\r\nposition. He also describes and figures the species.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, Dr. Geo. H. Horn (Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc., x., 1882-83; Monthly\r\nProc., Feb. 10, 1882, p. ii.) exhibited drawings illustrating the anatomy\r\nof _Platypsylla_ and _Leptinus_, and showed that a close relationship\r\nexists between these genera. Later, in his \"Notes on Some Little Known\r\nGenera and Species of Coleoptera\" (Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc., x., 1882-83,\r\npp. 113-126, pl. v., 114-116), he reviews the characters, and explains and\r\nillustrates the anatomical details. The differences he points out between\r\nhis observations and those of Le Conte are more particularly in the\r\nmandibles. In connection with this paper he also describes and illustrates\r\nthe structure of Leptinillus, which he separates from Leptinus, and\r\ndemonstrates their close relationship with Platypsyllus.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, Le Conte and Horn, in their \"Classification of the Coleoptera of\r\nNorth America\" (Washington, Smithsonian Institution, 1883), give (pp.\r\n13-15) a full description of the family characters, a little modified from\r\nLe Conte's first description, but sustaining his views on the systematic\r\nposition of _Platypsyllidae_.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, Alphonse Bonhoure (Ann. Soc. de France, 1883; Bull, des Seances,\r\np. cxxvi.) exhibited drawings and specimens of _Platypsyllus castoris_\r\nfound in the _Departement des Bouches du Rhone_.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Edm. Reitter, in \"_Platypsylla castoris_ Rits. als Vertreter\r\neiner neuer europaischen Coleopteren-Familie\" (Wiener entom. Zeit. iii.,\r\n1884, pp. 19-21) gives a lengthy description of the species with special\r\nregard to the sexual differences. He shows that the European insect is not\r\nspecifically distinct from the American form, but he does not express an\r\nopinion on the position of the family among the Coleoptera.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, Bonhoure (Ann. Soc. Ent. de France, 1884, pp. 143-153)\r\nmore fully records its discovery on _Castor fiber_ taken in the\r\nPetit-Rhone. It is a question whether this European beaver, now quite\r\nrare, is distinct from ours. He gives a very good review of the subject,\r\nwith a plate of the most important details, after Horn, and he fully\r\nindorses the coleopterological position of the insect.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Ritsema (_Tijdschrift voor Entomologie_, 1883-84,\r\nlxxxvi.) refers to Bonhoure's discovery of _Platypsylla_ in France, and\r\ncorrects Reitter in some unimportant details.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, Reitter, in \"_Coleopterologische Notizen_\" xiii. (Wiener\r\nentomolog. Zeit., vol. iv., 1885, p. 274), answers Ritsema's criticism.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, Dr. Friederich Brauer, in his masterly\r\n\"Systematisch-zoologische Studien\" (Sitzh. der Kais. Akad. der Wissensch.,\r\nxci., p. 364), speaks of the relationship in the thoracic characters\r\nbetween Mallophaga and Coleoptera as illustrated by Platypsyllus, by\r\ninference admitting the coleopterous nature of the latter, but recognizing\r\nthat it has mallophagous affinities.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, H. J. Kolbe, in his \"Ueber die Stellung von Platypsyllus im\r\nSystem\" (Berlin entom. Zeitsch., xxx., 1886, pp. 103-105), discusses the\r\nsubject, without any new evidence, however. He concludes that most of its\r\ncharacteristics relate it to the Corrodentia, and particularly to the\r\nsub-order Mallophaga, in which it has its closest kinship in Liotheidae.\r\nThe remarkable tripartite mentum he thinks should not be compared with the\r\nbipartite mentum of Leptinus, and calls attention to the fact that in\r\nAncistrona in Mallophaga it is also trilobed.\r\n\r\nThe above are the more important papers on the subject, though the insect\r\nhas been referred by other authors to both Neuroptera and Orthoptera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CHARACTERS OF PLATYPSYLLUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARVA OF PLATYPSYLLUS CASTORIS--DORSAL VIEW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATYPSYLLUS CASTORIS.]\r\n\r\nWhere the characters of the image have been so often described, it is\r\nunnecessary to refer to them in detail, and I will only call attention to\r\nthe more striking structural features and to some omissions by, or\r\ndifferences between, previous authors. A glance at the illustrations which\r\nI have prepared will show the prevailing characteristics of this\r\ninteresting creature, its general ovoid and flattened form, and more\r\nparticularly the flattened semicircular head. Dorsally, we notice the\r\nrather prominent occiput fringed behind with short and broad depressed\r\nspines or teeth which form a sort of comb, the prothorax trapezoidal and\r\nbut very slightly curved, with side margins strongly grooved. There is a\r\nvery distinct scutellem, and the two elytra are rounded at the tip and\r\nwithout venation. Hind wings and eyes are both wanting. The abdomen shows\r\nfive segments, each with a row of depressed bristles.\r\n\r\nOn the ventral surface we find among the more curious characteristics,\r\nfirst the antennae; these were originally described by Westwood as\r\nthree-jointed, the club being annulated. Le Conte could not distinctly\r\nmake out the number of annular joints upon this club, though he thought he\r\ndetected seven, which made nine joints to the whole antenna. The club is\r\nreceived in the deep cup-shaped excavation of the second joint. Horn\r\nthought he detected a division of the second joint, and resolved but six\r\nsegments in the club, making also nine joints to the whole antenna, but in\r\na somewhat different fashion from Le Conte. Westwood's figure shows eight\r\nannuli to the club. He failed to find any trace of the mandibles, but Le\r\nConte described them as small, flat, subquadrate, with the inner side\r\ndeeply crenulate, and resembling those of _Corylophus_; the stipes well\r\ndeveloped, and biarticulate. Horn could not entirely make out the\r\nmandibles as described by Le Conte, and rather concluded that what Le\r\nConte described is really one of the granules which occur behind the\r\nlabrum. He considered that the piece could hardly be even an aborted\r\nmandible, because of its diminutive size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG LARVA.]\r\n\r\nWhat all authors have agreed in calling the mentum is very noticeable,\r\nbeing large and broad, and trilobed behind. The maxillae are strong, with\r\ncomplicated stipes and with two flat, thin lobes, the inner one smaller\r\nthan the outer and rounded at the tip, both lobes being ciliate. The\r\nmaxillary palpi are four-jointed, the labial palpi three-jointed. The\r\nprosternum is very large, subtriangular, concealing the insertion of the\r\ncoxae, and extending over the front part of the mesosternum, as does this\r\nover the front of the metasternum. Six ventral segments of the abdomen are\r\nvisible behind the posterior coxae, which conceal two and the base of a\r\nthird. The coxae are flat and not at all prominent. The legs are\r\ncharacterized by broad and flattened tibiae and femora, and the strong\r\nspines with which they are armed. The tarsi are five-jointed, the front\r\nand middle pair with a row of claviform membraneous appendages each side,\r\nwhich Le Conte found only in the male.\r\n\r\nAmerican entomologists have been satisfied to follow Le Conte and Horn as\r\nto the position of Platypsyllus. Yet with such diversity of opinion on the\r\nsubject among high European authorities, the importance of a knowledge of\r\nthe adolescent states has been recognized, as the character of either the\r\nlarva or pupa would settle the question.\r\n\r\nDuring a stay at West Point, Neb., in October, 1886, I learned from one of\r\nmy agents, Mr. Lawrence Bruner, that there was a beaver in a creek not far\r\nfrom that point, and I at once made arrangements for him to trap the\r\nbeaver, and to look particularly for living specimens of Platypsyllus on\r\nthe skin, and especially the earlier stages. He succeeded in capturing the\r\nbeaver and sent me some fifteen specimens of the larva and also some\r\nimagos, but neither eggs nor pupae were found. A glance at the larva\r\nsatisfied me at once of its coleopterous nature; but as we have, waiting\r\nto be worked up and published, an _embarras de richesses entomologiques_\r\nin the collections of the National Museum, and as circumstances largely\r\ndecide the precedence, I should probably not have called attention to this\r\nlarva for some time, had it not been that at the last monthly meeting of\r\nthe Entomological Society of Washington, Dr. Horn, who was present,\r\nannounced the finding, the present spring, by one of his correspondents,\r\nof this very larva, and exhibited a specimen. Some points about it, and\r\nespecially the position of the spiracles, being yet rather obscure in his\r\nmind, he requested me to examine my material, which I have thus been led\r\nto do. I have made a figure of this larva which will sufficiently indicate\r\nits nature.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the trophi, and particularly the anal cerci, fully\r\nsettle the disputed point, and remove this insect completely from the\r\nMallophaga (none of which possess them), and confirm its position in the\r\nClavicorn series of the Coleoptera. Yet in the larva, as in the imago, the\r\neffects of its parasitic life are shown in certain modifications which\r\napproach the running section of the Mallophaga. Without going into details\r\nI may say that, besides its general and more decided coleopterological\r\nfeatures, this larva is distinguished by the shortness and stoutness of\r\nits legs, by the size and stoutness of the antennae, by the stiff and long\r\ndepressed hairs on the dorsal and more particularly on the ventral\r\nsurface, and by the dorsal position of the abdominal spiracles, all\r\ncharacters approaching the Mallophaga. The first pair of spiracles is\r\nlateral, and may be said to be mesothoracic, being placed on the\r\nmesothoracic joint, but on a distinct fold. The eight abdominal spiracles\r\nare placed on the sides of the dorsum, and in this respect recall the\r\nparasitic triungulin of the meloid larvae. The mandibles are barely\r\ncorneous, and they are more elongate and curved in the younger than in the\r\nolder larva, while the legs are also relatively stouter, more curved, and\r\nwith a much longer and sharper claw in the younger larva, which seems well\r\nfitted for grasping the hairs of its host.\r\n\r\nThere can no longer be any doubt, therefore, about the true position of\r\nPlatypsyllus. The eggs will probably be found attached in some way to the\r\nhairs of the animal they are laid on, much as they are in Mallophaga, and\r\nthe pupa is probably formed in the nests of the host, and not upon the\r\nskin, which will explain the reason for its not occurring with the larva\r\nand imago upon the beaver, either in the case of my specimens or those of\r\nDr. Horn.\r\n\r\nThe greatest resemblance of Platypsyllus in the imago state to the\r\nMallophaga is found in the spinous comb on the hind border of the occiput,\r\nthe arrangement of the spines on the abdomen, and the superficial antennal\r\nstructure, but particularly in the broad trilobed mentum. All of the other\r\ncharacteristics are readily referable to the Coleoptera, though, as Le\r\nConte pointed out, they are composite, recalling in the antennae the\r\nGrynidae, in the pronotum the Silphidae, in the mesosternum Limulodes, in\r\nthe elytra the Staphilindae, in the legs the Anisotomidae, and in the\r\nmandibles the Corylophidae. The scutellum and the five-jointed tarsi at\r\nonce remove it from Mallophaga, and it is a wonder that Le Conte and Horn\r\nhave not more fully insisted on this fact. The trophi are very\r\ncomplicated, and there are various details of structure not noticed or not\r\nmentioned by any of the writers upon the subject hitherto.\r\n\r\nI have been led to very carefully examine the imago, and the more closely\r\nI have done so, the more completely I realize the accuracy of Le Conte's\r\noriginal work. The mandibles are visible or not, according as they are\r\nexposed or withdrawn, and their existence may depend on the sex, as, so\r\nfar as my material justifies conclusion, they are visible in the male\r\nonly. Where found they correspond to Le Conte's description. Even in the\r\nlarva they are weak and of doubtful service in mastication, while in the\r\nimago they are, as is also the labrum, quite rudimentary, which fact\r\nhardly justifies us, however, in arguing their non-existence.\r\n\r\nAs confirmatory of the affinities of Platypsyllus, as here proved, it may\r\nbe mentioned that _Leptinus testaceous_ Mull., the only species of its\r\ngenus, is known to be parasitic on mice, as it has been found upon them in\r\nPhiladelphia by Dr. Jno. A. Ryder, and I have taken it in the nests of a\r\ncommon field mouse near Washington. But still more interesting is the fact\r\nthat _Leptinillus validus_ Horn (also the only species of its genus) is an\r\nassociate parasite of Platypsyllus on the beaver, a number of both having\r\nbeen taken by one of my agents, Mr. A. Koebele, in San Francisco, from\r\nbeaver skins brought from Alaska.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARVA OF PLATYPSYLLUS CASTORIS.]\r\n\r\nIn reference to the classificatory value that should be attached to an\r\naberrant type like this, I have already expressed my opinion in a paper on\r\nMegathymus, a Lepidopteron that connects in many ways the two great\r\ndivisions of butterflies and moths, published in the Transactions of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences of St. Louis, volume iii., 1876, and will take the\r\nliberty of reading a few passages therefrom:\r\n\r\n    \"Between all classificatory divisions, from variety to kingdom,\r\n    the separating lines we draw get more and more broken in\r\n    proportion as our knowledge of forms, past and present,\r\n    increases. Every step in advance toward a true conception of the\r\n    relations of animals brings the different groups closer\r\n    together, until at last we perceive an almost continuous chain.\r\n    Even the older naturalists had an appreciation of this fact.\r\n    Linnaeus' noted dictum, '_Natura saltus non facit_' implies it;\r\n    and Kirby and Spence justly observe that 'it appears to be the\r\n    opinion of most modern physiologists that the series of\r\n    affinities in nature is a concatenation or continuous series;\r\n    and that though an hiatus is here and there observable, this has\r\n    been caused either by the annihilation of some original group or\r\n    species, or that the objects required to fill it up are still in\r\n    existence but have not yet been discovered.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"Modern naturalists find in this more or less gradual blending\r\n    their strongest arguments in favor of community of descent; and\r\n    speculation as to the origin, or outcome rather, in the near\r\n    present or remote past of existing forms is naturally and very\r\n    generally indulged, even by those who a few years back were more\r\n    inclined to ridicule than accept Darwinian doctrine. Shall we\r\n    then say that the old divisions must be discarded because not\r\n    absolute? As well might we argue for the abolition of the four\r\n    seasons because they differ with the latitude, or because they\r\n    gradually blend into each other. Entomologists will always speak\r\n    of moths and butterflies, howsoever arbitrary the groups may\r\n    come to be looked upon, or however numerous the intermediate\r\n    gradations.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Families should, I think, be made as comprehensive as possible,\r\n    and not unduly multiplied; and in considering aberrant forms,\r\n    the objects of classification are best subserved by retaining\r\n    them in whatever division can claim the balance of characters.\r\n    It is better to widen than to restrict in the higher groups. Le\r\n    Conte does better service in bringing Platypsylla among the\r\n    Coleoptera than does Westwood in creating a new order--\r\n    Achreioptera--for it. Phylloxera, in Homoptera, is much more\r\n    wisely retained in the Aphididae than made the type of a new\r\n    family.\"\r\n\r\nPlatypsyllus, therefore, is a good Coleopteron, and in all the characters\r\nin which it so strongly approaches the Mallophaga it offers merely an\r\nillustration of modification due to food habit and environment. In this\r\nparticular it is, however, of very great interest as one of the most\r\nstriking illustrations we have of variation in similar lines through the\r\ninfluence of purely external or dynamical conditions, and where genetic\r\nconnection and heredity play no part whatever. It is at the same time\r\ninteresting because of its synthetic characteristics, being evidently an\r\nancient type from which we get a very good idea of the connection in the\r\npast of some of the present well-defined orders of insects.\r\n\r\nWestwood, though now an octogenarian, may safely be called England's most\r\neminent entomologist by virtue of the character and volume of the work\r\nwhich he has accomplished. Dr. Le Conte was, _facile princeps_, America's\r\nleading coleopterist. I do not know that any greater tribute could be\r\nadded to the sound judgment and deep knowledge possessed by that late\r\ndistinguished member of the Academy than the confirmation of his views as\r\nopposed to the views of Westwood and other European authorities which the\r\ndiscovery of this larva now gives us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SPECTRA OF OXYGEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author has observed a fact which furnishes a remarkable demonstration\r\nof the law of the production of the dark bands which he has detected in\r\nthe spectrum of oxygen. The phenomena of elective absorption in oxygen gas\r\nare manifested in two mutually distinct spectral systems. A first system,\r\nformed of fine rays, follows the law of the product of the gaseous system\r\ntraversed by its density. The second system is formed of bands much less\r\neasily resolved, is governed by the law of the product of the thickness by\r\nthe square of the density. This second law being quite novel in spectral\r\nanalysis, the author has instituted experiments necessary to prove that\r\nthis system of obscure bands really belongs to oxygen. These experiments\r\nrange from pressures of 100 atmospheres down to those of a few units, and\r\nwith lengths of tubes from 0.42 meter to 60 meters. At the same time\r\nprolonged observations have been made upon the atmosphere, brought into\r\nconnection with the experiments in the tubes. These observations, and\r\nespecially those made during autumn last on the Pic du Midi, prove that\r\nall the bands of the spectrum of oxygen are found in the spectrum of the\r\nsolar light if it is allowed to traverse a sufficient thickness of the\r\natmospheric medium. Further, on comparing, by the aid of photography, the\r\nintensities of the bands of the atmospheric spectrum with those given in\r\nthe tubes, the author has found that the intensities of these atmospheric\r\nbands fulfill the law of the square. It appears from _Wiedemann's Annalen_\r\nthat M. Olszewski, when liquefying oxygen, examined its spectrum and\r\nascertained the existence of the bands in question with a stratum of 7 mm.\r\nof liquid oxygen.--_J. Jansen._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       ON A THEORY CONCERNING THE SUDDEN LOSS OF MAGNETIC PROPERTIES\r\n                           OF IRON AND NICKEL.\r\n\r\n                       By Mr. H. TOMLINSON, B.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments by himself and other observers have shown that the\r\ntemperatures at which iron and nickel lose their magnetic properties\r\ndepend on the specimens used and the magnetizing forces employed; but the\r\ntemperatures at which they _begin to lose_ these properties are\r\ndefinite--for nickel about 300 deg. C., and iron about 680 deg. C. The author's\r\nown experiments on \"Recalescence of Iron\" show two critical temperatures;\r\nand Pinchon has shown by calorimetric measurement that between 660 deg. and\r\n720 deg. C., and between 1,000 deg. and 1,050 deg. C., heat becomes latent. All these\r\nfacts seem to indicate a molecular rearrangement about these temperatures.\r\n\r\nIn his proposed theory he assumes that the molecules of iron (say)\r\ncontain magnetic atoms capable of motions of translation and of rotation.\r\nThese tend to form closed magnetic circuits, but at ordinary temperatures\r\nare unable to do so on account of the close proximity of their centers. On\r\nraising the temperature their centers are further separated, till at about\r\n680 deg. C. their polar extremities rush together, forming complete circuits\r\nand exhibiting no external magnetic properties. On cooling down, the\r\ncenters approach until the gravitation attraction overcomes the magnetic\r\nattraction of their poles, when the magnetic properties reappear.\r\n\r\nProf. Ayrton asked whether the author had made experiments on the\r\nreappearance of magnetic properties when raised to a white heat, and Prof.\r\nThompson inquired whether cobalt had been tested. Both questions were\r\nanswered negatively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      POISON OF THE SOMALIS, EXTRACTED FROM THE WOOD OF THE OUABAIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principle in question, ouabaine, forms rectangular plates, very\r\nslender, of a nacreous appearance. It is absolutely white, inodorous, and\r\nnot appreciably bitter. It contains no nitrogen, and does not react with\r\ncoloring matters. At a boiling heat, in presence of dilute acids, it is\r\nsplit up, yielding a reductive sugar. Its composition is\r\nC_{90}H_{45}O_{12}. It is poisonous if introduced into the circulation,\r\nbut not if swallowed.--_M.
