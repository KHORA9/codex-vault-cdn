A precious gemstone has beauty, durability, and rarity,\r\nwhereas a semiprecious gemstone has only one or two of these qualities.\r\nA _gem_ is a gemstone that has been cut and polished.\r\n\r\nDiamond, corundum (ruby and sapphire), beryl (emerald and aquamarine),\r\ntopaz, and opal are generally classed as precious stones. All other\r\ngemstones are usually classed as semiprecious.\r\n\r\nA _mineral_ is any naturally formed homogeneous inorganic material.\r\n\r\nA _mineralogist_ is a person who studies the formation, occurrence,\r\nproperties, composition, and classification of minerals.\r\n\r\nA _gemologist_ is a person who has successfully completed recognized\r\ncourses in gemology (the science and study of gemstones) and has proven\r\nskills in identifying and evaluating gem materials.\r\n\r\nA _lapidary_ is a cutter, polisher, or engraver of precious stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Geologic environment\r\n\r\nGemstones are not plentiful. Gemstones do not form “ore” deposits in the\r\nnormal sense.\r\n\r\nGems, when present at all, tend to be scattered sparsely throughout a\r\nlarge body of rock or to have crystallized as small aggregates or fill\r\nveins and small cavities.\r\n\r\nEven stream gravel concentrations tend to be small—a few stones in each\r\nof several bedrock cracks, potholes, or gravel lenses in a stream bed.\r\n\r\nThe average grade of the richest diamond kimberlite pipes in Africa is\r\nabout 1 part diamond in 40 million parts “ore.” Kimberlite, a plutonic\r\nigneous rock, ascends from a depth of at least 100 kilometers (60 miles)\r\nto form a diatreme (narrow cone-shaped rock body or “pipe”). Moreover,\r\nbecause much diamond is not of gem quality, the average stone in an\r\nengagement ring is the product of the removal and processing of 200 to\r\n400 million times its volume of rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Gemstones occur in most major geologic environments.\r\n\r\nEach environment tends to have a characteristic suite of gem materials,\r\nbut many kinds of gems occur in more than one environment. Most\r\ngemstones are found in igneous rocks and alluvial gravels, but\r\nsedimentary and metamorphic rocks may also contain gem materials.\r\n\r\nExamples of geologic environments in which gemstones are found:\r\n\r\n_Pegmatite_—a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock body, occurring as\r\ndikes (a tabular-shaped body), lenses, or veins in the surrounding rock.\r\n\r\n_Stream gravels_ (_placers_)—deposits of heavier and more durable than\r\naverage minerals that have been eroded out of the original rock. Often\r\ntourmaline, beryl, and many other gem-quality minerals have eroded out\r\nof the original rock in which they formed and have moved and been\r\nconcentrated locally by water in streams. Sapphires in Judith Basin\r\nCounty, Montana, were first found when the gravels were worked for gold\r\nfrom 1895 to 1930.\r\n\r\n_Metamorphic rocks_—rocks that have been altered by great heat,\r\npressure, or both. Garnet, for example, is commonly found as crystals in\r\ngneiss and mica schist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quartz with phantoms, Brazil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aquamarine, Brazil.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Mineral gemstones\r\n\r\nHardness and specific gravity are two of the major characteristics of\r\ngemstones.\r\n\r\nHardness of a gemstone is its resistance to scratching and may be\r\ndescribed relative to a standard scale of 10 minerals known as the Mohs\r\nscale. F. Mohs, an Austrian mineralogist, developed this scale in 1822.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mohs’ scale, the hardness of—\r\n\r\n  Talc is              1\r\n  Gypsum is            2\r\n  Calcite is           3\r\n  Fluorite is          4\r\n  Apatite is           5\r\n  Feldspar is          6\r\n  Quartz is            7\r\n  Topaz is             8\r\n  Sapphire is          9\r\n  Diamond is          10\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity is the number of times heavier a gemstone of any volume\r\nis than an equal volume of water; in other words, it is the ratio of the\r\ndensity of the gemstone to the density of water.\r\n\r\n_The 16 mineral gemstone groups listed below are highly prized for their\r\nbeauty, durability, and rarity_:\r\n\r\n  Beryl (hardness: 7.5-8 Mohs)\r\n  Beryllium aluminum silicate\r\n  Specific gravity: 2.63-2.91\r\n\r\n  _Emerald_: Intense green or bluish green\r\n  _Aquamarine_: Greenish blue or light blue\r\n  _Morganite_: Pink, purple pink, or peach\r\n  _Heliodore_: Golden yellow to golden green\r\n  _Red beryl_: Raspberry red\r\n  _Goshenite_: Colorless, greenish yellow, yellow green, brownish\r\n\r\n  Chrysoberyl (hardness: 8.5 Mohs)\r\n  Beryllium aluminum oxide\r\n  Specific gravity: 3.68-3.78\r\n\r\n  _Chrysoberyl_: transparent yellowish green to greenish yellow and pale\r\n              brown\r\n  _Alexandrite_: red in incandescent light and green in daylight\r\n  _Cat’s eye_: usually yellowish or greenish\r\n\r\n  Corundum (hardness: 9 Mohs)\r\n  Aluminum oxide\r\n  Specific gravity: 3.96-4.05\r\n\r\n  _Ruby_: Intense red\r\n  _Sapphire_: Blue\r\n\r\n  Diamond (hardness: 10 Mohs)\r\n  Carbon\r\n  Specific gravity: 3.51\r\n\r\n  Colorless to faint yellowish tinge, also variable\r\n\r\n  Feldspar (hardness: 6-6.5 Mohs)\r\n  Two distinctly different alkali alumino silicates: the Plagioclase and\r\n              the Alkali Feldspar Series\r\n  Specific gravity: 2.55-2.76\r\n\r\n  Plagioclase Series—\r\n  _Labradorite_: Colorful, iridescent, also transparent stones in\r\n              yellow, orange, red, and green\r\n  _Sunstone_: Gold spangles from inclusions of hematite\r\n  _Peristerite_: Blue white iridescence\r\n\r\n  Alkali Feldspar Group—\r\n  _Orthoclase_: Pale yellow, flesh red\r\n  _Amazonite_: Yellow green to greenish blue\r\n  _Moonstone_: Colorless;

However, they are not as durable as gemstones\r\nfrom minerals:\r\n\r\n  Amber (hardness: 2-2.5 Mohs)\r\n  A mixture of hydrocarbons\r\n  Specific gravity: 1.05-1.096\r\n\r\nHard fossil resin or sap of ancient pine trees. Usually amorphous (lacks\r\ncrystalline structure). Sometimes mined, sometimes gathered on\r\nseashores.\r\n\r\nVaries from transparent to semitransparent and generally from light\r\nyellow to dark brown, but can be orange, red, whitish, greenish-brown,\r\nblue, or violet. Can be dyed in any color.\r\n\r\nTakes a fine polish. Used mainly in making beads or other ornaments.\r\n\r\n  Coral (hardness: 3.5-4 Mohs)\r\n  Formed mainly of calcite (calcium carbonate) or conchiolin, a horny\r\n              organic substance\r\n  Specific gravity: 2.60-2.70\r\n\r\nEach coral polyp, a tiny marine animal that lives in enormous colonies,\r\nextracts calcium carbonate from the sea and exudes it to build a\r\nprotective home around and above itself. Each generation of polyps dies\r\nin its protective home and each succeeding generation builds on top of\r\nits predecessor.\r\n\r\nGem coral ranges from semitranslucent to opaque and occurs in white,\r\npink, orange, red, blue, violet, golden, and black. The black and golden\r\ncorals are largely horny organic substances, not calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nThe finest coral is used to make figurines, cameos, carvings, and beads.\r\n\r\n  Jet (hardness: 2.5-4 Mohs)\r\n  Carbon plus various hydrocarbon compounds\r\n  Specific gravity: 1.30-1.32\r\n\r\nThis compact velvet-black coal takes a good polish and is often cut into\r\nbeads, bracelets, and a wide range of decorative and useful objects.\r\n\r\n  Pearl (hardness: 2.5-4.5 Mohs)\r\n  Formed within a mollusk, such as an oyster, that deposits a substance\r\n              called _nacre_ around an irritant that entered the\r\n              organism\r\n  Specific gravity: 2.71\r\n\r\nPearl-bearing mollusks are found in both salt and fresh water.\r\nSalt-water pearls of gem quality are usually preferred for jewelry; they\r\nare produced almost entirely by the mollusk _Pinctada_. Fresh-water\r\npearls are produced by various clams and mussels.\r\n\r\nNatural pearls come in various shapes: round, pear, drop, egg, and\r\nothers. They also come in various colors, such as white, cream, light\r\nrose, cream rose, black, gray, bronze, blue, dark blue, blue green, red,\r\npurple, yellow, and violet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Buyer beware\r\n\r\nInexperienced buyers must take whatever steps are needed to ensure that\r\ngems they intend to purchase are exactly what the seller purports them\r\nto be and that they are being offered at a fair market price.\r\n\r\nMore and more synthetic gems—and inferior grades and cuts of natural\r\ngems—are being sold to unwary buyers by unscrupulous sellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Since 1935, the mining of gemstones in the United States has been\r\nalmost entirely a recreational activity of mineral collectors and hobbyists.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, very few individuals have derived their entire income\r\nfrom gemstones mined by themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the proprietors of roadside rock shops buy all\r\nof their stock from others. Rock shops are abundant in areas of the\r\nUnited States that are rich in gem materials, and the shops tend to\r\nspecialize in the local gem commodities, most of which the proprietors\r\ngather.\r\n\r\nRather than doing the mining themselves, owners of land that has a\r\ndeposit of gem-quality minerals sometimes charge hobbyists for the right\r\nto collect gemstones. For example, diamond in Arkansas, opal in Idaho,\r\nand agate in Oregon and Washington are mined by hobbyists under this\r\n“fee digging” arrangement.\r\n\r\nHowever, the flow of money into the local economy by paying these small\r\nfees and by the purchase of gemstones is minor compared to the money the\r\nenthusiasts spend for lodging and other living expenses while visiting\r\nan area to dig for gemstones.\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds of natural gemstones have been found in every State of the\r\nUnited States, but much larger deposits of the most precious kinds are\r\nfound outside the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1990 U.S. output of natural gemstones was primarily from Tennessee,\r\n       California, Arizona, Arkansas, Montana, Nevada, and Maine.\r\n\r\nAn estimated 80,000 visitors found a total of 315 carats of diamonds in\r\nthe Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. There were sizeable\r\nyields of freshwater pearls in Tennessee, turquoise in Arizona and\r\nNevada, tourmaline in Maine, and tourmaline, kunzite, and garnet in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Gemstones: Value of U.S. production vs. imports, 1986 and 1989[1]\r\n\r\n  Production                          1986           1989\r\n  Natural                             $9.3 million  $43.0 million[2]\r\n  Synthetic                           10.3           23.5\r\n                                     $19.6          $66.5\r\n  Mine employment                      300            800\r\n  Imports for consumption:           $4.18 billion  $5.00 billion\r\n  Apparent reliance on imports over    99%            98%\r\n      exports[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Estimated.\r\n\r\n[2]Including freshwater pearls natural, and cultured.\r\n\r\n[3]Imports - exports + adjustments for Government and industry stock\r\n    changes.

A diamond mining project at the\r\nCrater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas is still being evaluated by\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n\r\n  World diamond reserves are estimated to be about 300 million carats,\r\n   including near-gem materials but not diamonds of abrasive quality.\r\n\r\nMost of the reserves are in southern Africa, Siberia, and western\r\nAustralia. It is difficult to estimate reserves because the value of a\r\ngiven deposit varies with the market for the gems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jade nephrite, China.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Hope Diamond, India.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Chemical formulas of gemstones\r\n\r\n  Beryl               BeࠣAlࠢSiࠦO₁ࠨ\r\n  Chrysoberyl         BeAlࠢOࠤ\r\n  Coral               CaCOࠣ\r\n  Corundum            AlࠢOࠣ\r\n  Diamond             C\r\n  Feldspar            Plagioclase Series:\r\n                      (Na,Ca)Al(Al,Si)SiࠢOࠨ\r\n                      Alkali Feldspar Group:\r\n                      Mixtures of Orthoclase—KAlSiࠣOࠨ and\r\n                      Albite—NaAlSiࠣOࠨ\r\n  Garnet              Almadine—FeࠣAlࠢ(SiOࠤ)ࠣ\r\n                      Andradite—CaࠣFeࠢ(SiOࠤ)ࠣ\r\n                      Grossular—CaࠣAlࠢ(SiOࠤ)ࠣ\r\n                      Pyrope—MgࠣAlࠢ(SiOࠤ)ࠣ\r\n                      Spessartine—MnࠣAlࠢ(SiOࠤ)ࠣ\r\n                      Uvarovite—CaࠣCrࠢ(SiOࠤ)ࠣ\r\n  Jade                Nephrite—Caࠢ(Mg,Fe)ࠥ(SiࠨOࠢࠢ) (OH)ࠢ\r\n                      Jadeite—NaAl(SiࠢOࠦ)\r\n  Lapis lazuli        Lazurite—(Na,Ca)ࠨ(AlSiOࠤ)ࠦ (SOࠤ,S,Cl)ࠢ\r\n  Opal                Hydrated Silica—SiOࠢ·_n_HࠢO\r\n  Peridot             (Mg,Fe)ࠢ(SiOࠤ)\r\n  Quartz              SiOࠢ\r\n  Spinel              MgAlࠢOࠤ\r\n  Topaz               AlࠢSiOࠤ(F,OH)ࠢ\r\n  Tourmaline          XYࠣAlࠦ(BOࠣ)ࠣ(SiࠦO₁ࠨ) (OHࠤ)\r\n                      [X is usually Na but may be replaced by Ca;\r\n                      Y is one of several metal ions]\r\n  Turquoise           CuAlࠦ(POࠤ)ࠤ(OH)ࠨ·4HࠢO\r\n  Zircon              ZrSiOࠤ\r\n\r\n\r\n        Some ways to contact a local rock, mineral, or gem club\r\n\r\nIf you have access to the most recent April Buyer’s Guide issue of the\r\n_Lapidary Journal_ magazine, scan its lists of gem and mineral clubs in\r\nthe United States and other countries.

It is\r\nnot a function of the USGS to exploit such resources.\r\n\r\nUSGS geologists perform continuing research on kimberlites, the initial\r\nsource of diamonds. Not all kimberlites are diamond-bearing, and some of\r\nthe research is directed to learning what indications you look for\r\nduring exploration to distinguish fertile from barren kimberlite. USGS\r\ngeologists are compiling a U.S. map showing the locations of known\r\nkimberlites.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Selected general references\r\n\r\nA trip to your local library is the best first step toward understanding\r\ngemstones and toward planning a trip to gem and rock shops or to places\r\nwhere you may be able to collect gemstones.\r\n\r\nA list of _Selected references on rocks, minerals, and gemstones_ is\r\ncompiled and updated every two years by the USGS Geologic Inquiries\r\nGroup, 907 National Center, Reston, VA 22092; (703) 648-4383. The list\r\nhas three sections: selected guides for rockhounds and hobbyists,\r\ngeneral references for all ages, elementary school to adult, and\r\nperiodicals.\r\n\r\nThe guides in Section I tell about equipment needed for collecting,\r\netiquette of collecting, map reading, organizing a collection,\r\ncollecting localities by States, mineral societies, mineral show dates\r\nand locations, and rock, mineral, and fossil dealers.\r\n\r\nThe references below focus mainly on natural gemstones and the gems made\r\nfrom them rather than on synthetic gemstones, rocks, or other nongem\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Minerals Yearbook_\r\n\r\nThe relatively few pages on gemstones in the multivolume _Minerals\r\nYearbook_ provide data on sources, kinds, and volume of domestic\r\nproduction, domestic consumption, prices, and foreign trade. This U.S.\r\nBureau of Mines yearbook is in the reference sections of many major\r\nlibraries.
