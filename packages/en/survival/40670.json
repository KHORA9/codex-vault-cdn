Perhaps it is that farmers as a whole are not specially fond\r\nof reading. This, however, is not to be wondered at, because after a\r\nlong day's work in the open air it is hard to rivet one's mind on\r\nanything more serious than the headlines of a daily newspaper, or the\r\nrose-tinted pictures of a rural magazine. Still, it is safe to\r\nprophesy that the successful farmer of the future will not only be a\r\nhard worker, but also a hard reader. And biography brings before us,\r\nin a vivid manner, the onward march of modern Agriculture.\r\n\r\nIt is also of interest to note how much Agriculture owes to men who\r\ncould scarcely be called practical farmers. Indeed, the author has\r\nbeen impressed, contrary to common opinion, with the success of the\r\nTownsman who takes to farming. But this is really no more surprising\r\nthan that the simple-hearted farm lad should forsake the Old Homestead\r\nfor the fascinations of the City, and by reason of his character,\r\ncourage, and industry, become in a few years the Captain of some great\r\ncommercial enterprise. There will always be the ceaseless ebb and\r\nflow of the human tide between country lane and crowded street. But it\r\nis surely our plain duty to do something to make the life of the\r\nworker in the field less dull and lonely, and more attractive by the\r\nerection of pleasant cottages and the establishment of rural\r\nindustries: while, at the same time, we try to brighten the life of\r\nthe toiler in the town by freehold garden lots and sunlit, open\r\nspaces.\r\n\r\nI desire to thank the Editors of the several papers in which these\r\nSketches have appeared for kind permission to republish them in book\r\nform: The _Graphic_ (Chapter I), The _Star_, Johannesburg (Chapter\r\nII), the _Rand Daily Mail_ (Chapters III and IV), and the _Sunday\r\nPost_ (Chapter V).

Here, in the year 1674, was born the man who revolutionized\r\nBritish agriculture and laid the foundations for the \"Conquest of the\r\nDesert.\" Yet, strange as it may seem, until the other day Tull's\r\ngrave was unknown, and even now no monument marks the resting-place of\r\nthis illustrious husbandman. His family was of ancient and honourable\r\nlineage, and he was heir to a competent estate. At seventeen he\r\nentered his name on the register of St. John's College, Oxford; but he\r\ndid not proceed to a degree. Two years later he was admitted as a\r\nstudent of Gray's Inn, and was, in due course, called to the Bar. It\r\nis probable that Tull studied law not so much with the thought of\r\ntaking it up seriously as a profession, but simply in order to better\r\nfit himself for a political career. Ill-health, however, made him turn\r\nhis attention to farming. At the age of twenty-five he married a lady\r\nof good family, Miss Susanna Smith, of the County of Warwick, and then\r\nsettled down to farm in Oxfordshire.\r\n\r\nHis first farm was Howberry, in the parish of Crowmarsh. The land of\r\nthis farm was fertile and renowned for heavy crops of both wheat and\r\nbarley. Here Tull lived and toiled for nine years, till at last his\r\nhealth broke down and he was ordered south to the milder climate of\r\nFrance and Italy. So he decided to sell a portion of his Oxfordshire\r\nestate and send his family to another farm in Berkshire named\r\n\"Prosperous,\" situated in the parish of Shalbourne. After an absence\r\nof three years Tull returned to \"Prosperous Farm\"--a place for ever\r\nfamous in the annals of agriculture. Here he lived for twenty-six\r\nyears to the close of his strenuous, chequered career. Of this farm,\r\nTull writes: \"Situated on a little chalk on one side and heath on the\r\nother, the soil is poor and shallow--generally too light and too\r\nshallow to produce a tolerable crop of beans. This farm was made out\r\nof the skirts of others; a great part was a sheep down with a full\r\nreputation of poverty.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Europe Tull took special note of the deep and careful\r\ncultivation of the vineyards, where the tillage of the soil between\r\nthe rows of the grape vines was made to take the place of manuring the\r\nland. On his return to England he tried this method at \"Prosperous\r\nFarm,\" first with turnips and potatoes, and then with wheat. And by\r\nadopting this simple system with some few modifications of his own, he\r\nwas enabled to grow wheat on the same fields for thirteen years\r\ncontinuously without the use of manure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was on his farm of Howberry that Tull invented and perfected his\r\ndrill in the year 1701. He has told the story of this invention in the\r\npages of his great work. Finding his plans for growing sainfoin[1]\r\nhindered by the distaste of his labourers for his new methods, he\r\nresolved to try to \"contrive an engine to plant St. Foin more\r\nfaithfully than such hands would do. For that purpose I examined and\r\ncompared all the mechanical ideas that ever had entered my\r\nimagination, and at last pitched upon a groove, tongue, and spring in\r\nthe sound-board of the organ. With these, a little altered, and some\r\nparts of two other instruments, as foreign to the field as the organ\r\nis, added to them, I composed my machine. It was named a drill,\r\nbecause, when farmers used to sow their beans and peas in channels or\r\nfurrows by hand, they called that action drilling.\" And thus Tull's\r\ndrill, taken from the rotary mechanism of his favourite organ, is the\r\npioneer of all modern planters. His first invention was what he termed\r\na _drill-plough_ to sow wheat and turnip seed three rows at a time.\r\n\r\n[1] A leguminous plant cultivated for fodder.\r\n\r\nIt was this invention that led Tull to enunciate his first principle\r\nof tillage, namely, _drilling_. And it is the more amazing to reflect\r\nthat even after this long lapse of time many farmers still persist in\r\nbroadcasting their seed; for, as a recent authority working on the\r\nsemi-arid lands of Montana writes: \"Sowing broadcast is bad at any\r\ntime, but in dry-farming it is suicidal.\" That the use of the drill\r\nhas everywhere effected an enormous saving of seed is common\r\nknowledge; but let us hear what Tull has to say under this head: \"Seed\r\n(sainfoin) was scarce, dear, and bad, and enough could scarce be got\r\nto sow, as was usual, seven bushels[2] to an acre. I examined and\r\nthought the matter out, and found the greater part of the seed\r\nmiscarried, being bad, or too much covered. I observed, and counted,\r\nand found when much seed had miscarried the crop was best.\" Here was\r\nhis second principle, _reduction of seed_, or, as we now say,\r\n\"thin-seeding,\" a practice which has been adopted by the dry-farmers\r\nof Utah with remarkable success.\r\n\r\n[2] At the present time it is customary to sow from 80-100 lb. of\r\nsainfoin seed per acre.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Tull was an ardent advocate of the weedless field, and he\r\nsaw, clearly enough, that dung was a serious menace to clean tillage,\r\nas the seeds of troublesome weeds were apt to be scattered far and\r\nwide over the farm. This led him to lay down as his third\r\nprinciple--the _absence of weed_. But he certainly never, as is\r\nsometimes said, condemned the use of manure. His experiments, however,\r\nproved beyond the shadow of doubt that good crops might be grown\r\nsimply and solely by means of deep and constant tillage. So he says,\r\nangrily: \"The vulgar in general believe that I carried my farmyard\r\ndung and threw it in a river. I have no river near; besides, my\r\nneighbours buy dung at a good price; but it is known I neither sell\r\nnor waste any dung. Against such lying tongues there is no defence.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, many years after his part was taken by none other than\r\nthe great scientist of Rothamsted, the late Sir John Lawes, who wrote\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Tull was quite an original genius and a century in advance of his\r\ntime. I consider he has been most unjustly accused of not placing\r\nsufficient value upon farmyard manure; he advocated cleanliness, and\r\nsaw that dung was a great carrier of weeds. To give some clear idea of\r\nthe value of Tull's advocacy of drill-husbandry and the freedom from\r\nweed which can alone be obtained by the use of the drill, I may\r\nmention that so far as statistics will allow, I have ascertained the\r\naverage yield of the wheat crop of the world, and I am able to say\r\nthat the average yield is less than it is at the present time upon my\r\npermanent wheat land, after more than sixty years absolutely without\r\nmanure. Here we have the result of Tull's three great\r\nprinciples--_drilling, reduction of seed, and absence of weed_. If he\r\nwere alive now and were writing for the agriculture of the world, he\r\nwould, I think, be quite justified in saying everything he said in\r\nregard to cleanliness and manure.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of his studies, travels, and experiments, Tull published\r\n\"The New Horse-Hoeing Husbandry: or an Essay on the Principles of\r\nTillage and Vegetation\" in the year 1731. The great value of this work\r\nis that it is founded not upon mere theory, but upon actual\r\nexperiments in the field. The fourth edition, which I have beside me,\r\nconsists of 426 pages, with several plates, and 23 chapters which\r\ntreat of the following subjects: Of Roots and Leaves; Of Food of\r\nPlants; Of Pastures of Plants; Of Dung; Of Tillage; Of Weeds; Of\r\nTurnips; Of Wheat; Of Smuttiness; Of Lucerne; Of Change of Species; Of\r\nChange of Individuals; Of Ridges; Old and New Husbandry; Of Ploughs;\r\nThe Four-Coulter'd Plough; Of the Drill-Boxes; Of the Wheat-Drill: Of\r\nthe Turnip-Drill; Of the Hoe-Plough; with an appendix concerning the\r\nmaking of the drill and the hoe-plough.\r\n\r\nTull's idea--which was that by tillage soils might be constantly and\r\nfor ever reinvigorated or renewed--is summed up in his famous epigram,\r\n\"tillage is manure.\" He believed that the earth was the true and the\r\nsole food of the plant, and, further, that the plant feeds and grows\r\nby taking in minute particles of soil. And since these particles are\r\nthrown off from the surface of the soil grains, it followed,\r\ntherefore, that the more finely the soil was divided the more numerous\r\nthe particles and the more readily the plant would grow. Although\r\nTull's theories were wrong, his practice has been followed by all\r\nprogressive farmers down to the present time. We now know that plants\r\ndo not absorb particles of earth, but take in food in solution.\r\nConsequently, the more the particles of soil are broken up and\r\nrefined, the more plant food the roots can absorb. In this volume,\r\nwhich must be counted an agricultural classic, Tull at once takes rank\r\nas the foremost preacher of his time of the gospel of deep and perfect\r\ntillage. And it is a work which, in the words of his great compeer,\r\nArthur Young, will \"unquestionably carry his name to the latest\r\nposterity.\"\r\n\r\nThe botanical world has recently been illumined by the splendid\r\ndiscovery of the principles of heredity set forth by Gregor Mendel,\r\nand the foremost exponent of the new science, Professor Bateson,\r\nwrites as follows: \"We have at last a brilliant method and a solid\r\nbasis from which to attack these problems, offering an opportunity to\r\nthe pioneer such as occurs but seldom even in the history of modern\r\nscience.\" Cannot we, as agriculturists, say the same with equal truth?\r\nFor, to our thinking, Jethro Tull bears the same relation to\r\ndry-farming that Mendel does to plant-breeding. For if, on the one\r\nhand, his drill-ploughs are the models from which have been derived\r\nthe marvellous agricultural machines of modern times, then, on the\r\nother, his clean husbandry, his seed selection, his deep and constant\r\ntillage are the fundamental principles in the great new science of\r\ndry-farming. Nor should we forget that both Mendel and Tull\r\nenunciated their principles only after long and patient experiment.\r\n\r\nThe principles which we have adopted in our experiments on the\r\nGovernment Dry-Land Station at Lichtenburg, in the Transvaal and which\r\nwe propose to follow on all stations hereafter to be established in\r\nthe Union of South Africa, are seven in number, namely: (1) Deep\r\nploughing; (2) drilling; (3) thin seeding; (4) frequent harrowing; (5)\r\nweedless lands; (6) few varieties; and (7) moisture-saving fallows.\r\nAnd we know full well that the more faithfully we adhere to this\r\nscheme the richer shall be our harvests. But, after all, these\r\nprinciples are merely the amplification, nothing more, of those\r\nfundamental methods of tillage so plainly set forth, one hundred and\r\neighty-two years ago, by the genius of Jethro Tull.\r\n\r\nTull died in the month of March, in the year 1740, at the age of\r\nsixty-six. In speaking of agricultural education we have frequently\r\nurged the benefits to be derived from a liberal education, and we like\r\nto recall Tull's own words: \"I owe my principles and practice\r\noriginally to my travels, as I owe my drill to my organ.\" Here indeed,\r\nwas a man of many parts--a famous agriculturist, an able mechanic, a\r\ngood musician, and a keen classical scholar. His life, strange to say,\r\nwas one dauntless struggle with disease. For six years he scarce ever\r\nleft his room, and seldom in that period was he gladdened by so much\r\nas a glimpse of his \"hundred acres of drilled wheat.\" So they laid the\r\ntired body of the simple-minded English squire under the yew-trees of\r\nBasildon in the mellow soil he loved so well. But the bells of the old\r\nchurch of Saint Bartholomew now ring out with a new, glad message,\r\nfor they tell the toiling husbandmen of all lands to be of good cheer,\r\nfor the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose; while the winds\r\nand the waters carry the echo of Tull's name down through the\r\ncorridors of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nCOKE OF NORFOLK: FATTIER OF EXPERIMENTAL FARMS\r\n\r\n\r\n    _\"Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand\r\n    before Kings; he shall not stand before mean men.\"_\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this article we have quoted a text taken from the\r\nProverbs of Solomon, which we believe can be applied more truthfully\r\nto the subject of our paper than to any other name conspicuous in the\r\nannuals of agriculture. For he was a man diligent in his business and\r\nhe stood before Kings.\r\n\r\nThomas William Coke, of Holkham (Holy Home), Earl of Leicester, was\r\nthe eldest son of Robert Wenman. He was born in the year 1752, and\r\neducated at Eton, after which he travelled abroad. On the death of his\r\nfather, Coke was elected in his place as member of Parliament for the\r\nCounty of Norfolk. He was then in his twenty-second year. He entered\r\nthe youngest member; his political career extended over a period of\r\nfifty-seven years, and he finished up as \"Father of the House of\r\nCommons.\" His domestic life was singularly happy--very different from\r\nthe sad state of his great contemporary Arthur Young. In 1775 he\r\nmarried his cousin, Jane Dutton, by whom he had three daughters. After\r\nher death in 1800 he remained a widower for twenty-one years and then\r\nat the age of sixty-eight wedded a girl of eighteen, Lady Anne Keppel,\r\nby whom he had five sons and one daughter. Coke had the unique\r\nexperience of being offered a Peerage seven times under six different\r\nPrime Ministers, and he was the first commoner raised to the Peerage\r\nby Queen Victoria on her accession to the Throne. In this connection\r\nan amusing story is told. In the year 1817 Coke was called on to\r\npresent, at a Levee, a very forcible address to the Prince of Wales,\r\nwho was then acting as Regent, praying him \"to dismiss from his\r\npresence and Council those advisers, who, by their conduct, had proved\r\nthemselves alike enemies to the Throne and the people.\" The Regent was\r\nwarned of the proposal. Knowing that Coke valued his position as a\r\nCommoner above everything else, he declared with an oath that: \"If\r\nCoke of Norfolk enters my presence, by God, I'll knight him.\" This\r\nspeech was repeated to Coke. \"If he dares,\" was the rejoinder, \"by God\r\nI'll break his sword.\"\r\n\r\nPart of the estate or Holkham was formerly a series of salt marshes\r\non the coast of the North Sea. And when Coke came into his property in\r\n1776--a fateful year in the history of the British Empire the\r\nsurrounding district was little better than a rabbit-warren, with long\r\nstretches of shingle and sand. Soon after Coke's marriage, when his\r\nwife remarked that she was going down to Norfolk, the witty old Lady\r\nTownshend said, \"Then, my dear, all you will see will be one blade of\r\ngrass and two rabbits fighting for that.\" The story of how Coke came\r\nto be a practical farmer is told in the third volume of the Journal of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society of England, published in the year 1842.\r\nThe article containing it was written by Earl Spencer, and is of\r\nspecial interest as he had it direct from the lips of Mr. Coke (then\r\nLord Leicester) a short time before his death. When Coke entered into\r\nhis heritage, he found that five leases were about to expire. These\r\nfarms were held at a rental of 3s. 6d. an acre; and in the previous\r\nleases they had been valued at 1s. 6d. an acre. At that time the\r\nagriculture of Norfolk was of the poorest character; and we may judge\r\nof the quality of the Holkham land by comparing it with the average\r\nrent of 10s. an acre which Arthur Young says prevailed at this time.\r\nCoke sent for the two tenants, Mr. Brett and Mr. Tann, and offered to\r\nrenew their leases at a slightly higher figure, namely 5s. an acre.\r\nBoth refused; and Mr. Brett jeered at the suggestion, saying that the\r\nland was not worth even the 1s. 6d. an acre which had originally been\r\npaid for it. This curt refusal was enough for a man of Coke's\r\ntemperament. He forthwith decided to farm the land himself. It was\r\nthus that a young man of twenty-two, possessor of a princely fortune,\r\nfresh from the salons of Europe, suddenly turned his back on a gay\r\nand fashionable world; and stung into action by the laughter of a lazy\r\ntenant, took up the management of a sterile farm, raised a parish from\r\npoverty to affluence, transformed a desolate county into a cornfield,\r\nand left a name renowned in the annals of English agriculture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the history of agriculture, the name of Coke is chiefly remembered\r\nby those famous gatherings locally known as \"Coke's Clippings.\" These\r\nwonderful meetings began in a simple way with the clipping or shearing\r\nof sheep, but soon came to embrace the whole realm of the rural\r\nindustry. As might be imagined, when Coke took over the management of\r\nhis farms, he had not the slightest knowledge of the science and\r\npractice of agriculture. So he called together his neighbours and\r\nfrankly asked their advice.\r\n\r\nThey in turn were doubtless glad to meet a young man so keen and so\r\neager to learn. Soon they brought their friends and their relatives,\r\nand two years later these little country gatherings had assumed a more\r\ndefinite character, and were thereupon called \"Coke's Clippings.\" Soon\r\nagriculturists from all parts of Great Britain wrote to ask if they\r\nmight attend. Swiftly and steadily the fame of the \"clippings\" grew,\r\ntill presently scientific and other celebrated men from the United\r\nStates and the Continent travelled to England to take part in these\r\nmeetings. Year by year they increased in numbers till at last they\r\nembraced every nationality, every profession, and every rank in life,\r\nfrom Royalty to the poorest peasant. Holkham had, in fact, become a\r\ngreat experimental farm--a private estate turned by the enterprise of\r\nits owner into a public institution. Nowadays, we are familiar with\r\nState experimental farms, which are visited by thousands of farmers\r\nonce or twice a year. But a century ago such a thing was unheard of,\r\nand Coke may justly be termed the \"Father of the Experimental Farm.\"\r\nAt these shearings Coke presented many cups and prizes for the\r\ninvention of any new agricultural implement, for suggestions with\r\nregard to improved systems of cropping, of irrigation, of enriching\r\nthe soil, and for articles on agricultural subjects--in a word, to\r\nevery one who contributed to advance any branch whatsoever of the\r\nagricultural industry. Moreover, we are told that at a meeting of 1803\r\nsweepstakes were offered for guessing the correct weight of a wether.\r\nThe winner was a certain Mr. Money Hill, who guessed the exact\r\nweight--130 lbs.; while a butcher named Rett was a good second, and he\r\nguessed the weights of four other sheep within one pound. It is said\r\nthat, one year, there died on the Holkham estate a tenant who had won\r\nno less than £800 in prizes at the \"clippings.\" Party politics were\r\ncarefully excluded from these meetings, and any attempt to introduce a\r\nparty spirit into the speeches at the annual dinners was at once\r\nsilenced by Coke. As a politician he was a prominent Whig, but as an\r\nagriculturist he sank his politics and opened his doors to men of\r\nmerit irrespective of their views. Thus he gave Sir John Sinclair a\r\nmagnificent goblet as a token of his appreciation of Sinclair's \"Code\r\nof Agriculture,\" in spite of the fact that Sir John was a strong\r\nsupporter of the \"vile Tories and their viler head, Mr. Pitt.\" Sir\r\nJohn was pleased beyond measure and remarked, with a true Highland\r\ncourtesy, that hitherto the most priceless heirloom in his castle had\r\nbeen the drinking cup of Mary Queen of Scots, but henceforth he would\r\nlook on the goblet of his Whig friend as his greatest treasure.\r\n\r\nThe last of \"Coke's Clippings\" took place in the year 1821. It was\r\nattended by seven thousand people, and lasted three whole days. There\r\nis something very pleasing in the account of this pastoral scene. A\r\nstately mansion in a splendid park, with a group of village maidens\r\nspinning flax, on a velvet lawn, in the midst of a vast concourse of\r\npeople drawn from all parts of the earth. Punctually at ten o'clock in\r\nthe morning, so we read, Miss Coke came on to the lawn, accompanied by\r\nher father, and the Duke of Sussex. Then after greetings taken and\r\ngreetings given, the vast crowd proceeded, some riding, some driving,\r\nsome walking, to inspect the different farms on the estate. The first\r\nday was given up to the study of the inoculated pasture, prize\r\ncattle, new implements, sheep-shearing amid farm crops. The second day\r\nwas devoted to fresh fields, farm schools and cottage gardens. The\r\nthird day was absorbed in the inspection of the carcases of animals\r\nthat had been slaughtered, speech-making, and the distribution of\r\nprizes. On that day at 3 p.m., seven hundred guests sat down to\r\ndinner, a mid-day meal, which, with the speeches and prizes lasted for\r\nseven hours! The historian of this period has left us an account of\r\nthe most popular toasts at these annual banquets, such as \"A Fine\r\nFleece and a Fat Carcase,\" \"The Plough and a Good Use of It,\" while\r\nthe tribute to Coke's efforts to enclose all waste lands always\r\nbrought down the house, for it wittily ran: \"The Enclosing of all\r\nWaists,\" and Coke's own toast \"Live and Let Live,\" was invariably\r\ngreeted with tumultuous applause. The two annalists who have left us\r\nunimpeachable accounts of those memorable meetings are both agreed\r\nthat Coke himself was the central figure. Dr. Rigby, in \"Holkham and\r\nits Agriculture\" (1818) writes: \"He is everywhere and with everyone.\r\nHe solicits enquiry from everyone.\" At each halt in the ride little\r\nknots of people collected round him and listened with absorbed\r\ninterest to all he said, while for hours he thus sustained the\r\ncharacter of leader, lecturer, and host. And the American Ambassador\r\nof that day, His Excellency Mr. Richard Rush, writes in \"A Residence\r\nat the Court of London,\" \"No matter what the subsequent advance of\r\nEnglish agriculture or its results, Mr. Coke will ever take honourable\r\nrank among the pioneers of the great work. Come what will in the\r\nfuture, the Holkham sheep-shearings' will live in English rural\r\nannals. Long will tradition speak of them as uniting improvements in\r\nagriculture to an abundant, cordial, and joyous hospitality.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Coke started to farm in Norfolk the value of rotation was\r\nunknown. Then, it was customary to grow three white straw crops in\r\nsuccession followed by broadcast turnips. It was not to be wondered at\r\nthat soil which consisted mainly of drifting sand and sharp, flinty\r\ngravel should soon become worn out. Coke changed this practice and\r\ngrew only two white crops in succession and then let the land lie in\r\npasture for the next two years. He began to manure heavily; and used\r\nrape-cake as a top dressing with marked success. Moreover, he found\r\nthat the soil of almost the whole district was composed of very light\r\nsand and underlaid with a stratum of rich marl. Pits were opened, the\r\nmarl dug out, and scattered over the surface of the land. This not\r\nonly promoted fertility, but gave to the soil that solidity which is\r\nso essential to the growth of wheat, It was Coke's proud boast that he\r\nturned West Norfolk from a rye-growing into a wheat-growing district.\r\nBut it took him eleven years before he could get wheat to grow on the\r\npoor, sandy soil of his own estate. Nevertheless, before he died,\r\nthese so-called \"rabbit and rye\" lands were yielding as much as\r\nthirty-two bushels to the acre. His main idea was to stock heavily;\r\nmore for the sake of manure than for the sake of meat. He pinned his\r\nfaith on the motto: \"Muck is the mother of money.\" And we are told\r\nthat he was accustomed to say to his tenants, \"If you will keep an\r\nextra yard of bullocks, I will build you a yard and sheds free of\r\nexpense.\" He was a patient man but he was once heard to remark: \"It is\r\ndifficult to teach anything to adult ignorance. I had to contend with\r\nprejudice, an ignorant impatience of change, and a rooted attachment\r\nto old methods.\" He referred to the fact that the farmers still\r\npersisted in the old system of sowing cereals broadcast, or else\r\nlaboriously made holes with a dibbing-iron into which the grain was\r\ndropped, while another man followed with a rake and covered up the\r\nholes. Thus he used the drill for sixteen years before any of his\r\nneighbours could be induced to adopt it; and even when the farmers\r\nbegan at last to see the benefit of this rapid manner of sowing, he\r\nestimated that its spread was only a mile each year. By-and-by,\r\nhowever, he noticed that a quaint term for a good crop of barley had\r\ncome into use at Holkham. His farmers spoke of \"hat-barley\" for the\r\nreason that if a man throws his hat into a crop of barley, the hat\r\nrests on the surface if the crop is good, but falls to the ground if\r\nthe crop is bad. \"All sir,\" said his tenants at length, \"is\r\n'hat-barley' since the drill came.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCoke was never tired of experimenting with every kind of crop.\r\nCocksfoot (orchard grass) was cultivated with great success and\r\nnumbers of sheep were fattened on it. On land, once considered\r\nworthless, he cut four hundred tons of sainfoin from one hundred and\r\nfour acres. He early recognised the merits of swedes, and was the\r\nfirst to grow them on a large scale. He made a special study of birds\r\nin relation to the eradication of grubs. Finding a field of turnips\r\ninfested with a larva which caused black canker he turned four hundred\r\nducks into the field which they cleared of this pest in five days.\r\nEarly in his career Coke discarded the native sheep of Norfolk, with\r\nbacks as narrow as rabbits, in favour of the Southdowns, and gradually\r\nbecame one of the largest sheep-breeders in England. Encouraged by\r\nthe Duke of Bedford, another eminent agriculturist, he started a herd\r\nof North Devons, and thereafter bred them with much success. He also\r\nimproved the Suffolk breed of pigs by crossing them with the\r\nNeapolitan, thereby obtaining a superior quality of pork.\r\nAfforestation was one of his special hobbies. He fully realised the\r\ntruth of the old saying that a tree is growing while its planter is\r\nsleeping. Every year he planted fifty acres of timber, mostly oak,\r\nSpanish chestnut, and beech, till he had three thousand acres of\r\nbleak, wind-swept country well covered. He permitted the poor of the\r\nneighbourhood to plant potatoes among his young trees for two or three\r\nyears; a practice which kept his land clean and saved the expense of\r\nhoeing. And in the year 1832 he embarked in a ship built of oak from\r\nthe acorns which he himself had planted.\r\n\r\nHe always maintained that the interests of landlord and tenant were\r\nidentical. In order, therefore, to encourage his tenants to exert\r\nthemselves to the utmost, he let out his farms on long leases of\r\ntwenty-one years at a moderate rental and burdened with but few\r\nrestrictions. He soon saw, however, that in the case of an indolent\r\ntenant a long lease would mean the rapid deterioration of the\r\nproperty. It happened at this time that a certain farmer named Mr.\r\nOverman, who had been foremost in furthering the new agricultural\r\nschemes, applied for a farm on the Holkham estate. Coke allowed him,\r\nas an experiment, to draw up the covenants of his own lease. Overman\r\nstraightway inserted a clause making the improved course of cropping\r\ncompulsory. Coke was so pleased that he at once made this lease the\r\nmodel for all his other tenants with a few slight modifications. And\r\nso the land was fully protected from any possible injury through a\r\nlong period of bad farming. By such improved methods Coke is said to\r\nhave raised the annual rental of his estate from £2,200 to £20,000;\r\nwhile the yearly fall of timber and underwood averaged £2,700--a sum\r\nwhich exceeded the whole of his old rent roll. During his sixty-six\r\nyears at Holkham he spent over half a million pounds sterling on\r\nimprovements alone, without taking into account the large sums spent\r\non his house, domain, and home-farm buildings. Yet it is averred that\r\nthis vast outlay was all regained in due course. At that period the\r\nHolkham estate consisted of 4,300 acres in a ring fence, with a park\r\nof 3,500 acres surrounded by a ten-mile wall close to the sea. In a\r\nvolume entitled \"Agricultural Writers\" (1200-1800) by Donald\r\nMcDonald, the name of Coke does not appear. And it would seem that all\r\nhe ever wrote were some papers for the \"Annals of Agriculture\" (Arthur\r\nYoung), and a pamphlet on \"An Address to the Freeholders of Norfolk.\"\r\n\r\nThe biography of this remarkable man has recently been written in two\r\nbrightly bound and lavishly illustrated volumes by Mrs. A. M. W.\r\nStirling, under the title of \"Coke and his Friends.\"[3] His memory\r\nwell deserved the laborious and loving tribute of his enthusiastic\r\ngreat grand-child. But to be of any practical value to the\r\nagriculturist, the book must be greatly condensed. Out of thirty-five\r\nchapters we can find only five which tell of his services to the\r\nagricultural industry. Out of a thousand odd pages we can find only\r\none hundred and sixteen which bear on the science and practice of\r\nfarming. Out of sixty-four carefully executed illustrations we can\r\nonly find four which have anything whatsoever to do with rural\r\naffairs. It may be affirmed that Coke was much more than a mere\r\nagriculturist. That is very true; but surely his fame rests far more\r\non his services to rural progress than on his reputation as a\r\npolitician, a society leader, or a landlord. We therefore hope that at\r\nno distant date the same flowing pen which has produced the bulkier\r\nvolumes will compile a handier life dealing altogether with Coke's\r\nagricultural doings. Coke died in 1842 at the age of eighty-eight, and\r\nwas buried in the family mausoleum attached to the Tittleshall Church,\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\n[3] Published by Mr. John Lane, London.\r\n\r\nIn a life drama so vivid and forceful there are yet two vivid scenes\r\nwe cannot fail to recall. It was Coke who brought forward the motion\r\nin the House of Commons to recognise the independence of the American\r\nColonies. All night long the House sat. At 8.30 a.m., the end came.\r\nAmid breathless silence the result was announced 177 Noes, 178 Ayes.\r\nIt was Coke who announced to the obstinate, discomfited King the\r\nresult of that great debate, whereby the disastrous fratricidal war\r\nwas forever ended and the independence of the United States\r\nacknowledged by the Parliament of the Mother Country, after nine\r\nbitter years, by a majority of one vote. The Parish of Burnham lies\r\nnext to the Parish of Holkham. And the son of the rector of the former\r\nvillage, a fragile, delicate lad, used sometimes to join Mr. Coke's\r\nhounds when they were out coursing. But he was never asked to shoot,\r\nas only once had he been known to hit a partridge. One day this poor\r\nyoung man, returning from a two years' cruise paid a visit to his\r\nwealthy neighbour and stayed overnight. The great-uncle of his host\r\nbuilt the mansion house of Holkham, and Thomas William Coke spent all\r\nhis life and a large fortune in developing the family estate. But the\r\nBritish people placed Nelson, the frail and nervous guest, who slept\r\nthat night in the humble turret-room, on the top of the Column in the\r\ncentre of Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR YOUNG: AUTHOR OF THE AGRICULTURAL TOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n    _\"The magic of property turns sands into gold. Give a man the\r\n    secure possession of a bleak rock, and he will turn it into a\r\n    garden; give him a nine years' lease of a garden, and he will\r\n    convert it into a desert.\"_--Arthur Young.\r\n\r\nArthur Young, the greatest of English agriculturists and the poorest\r\nof practical farmers, was born at Whitehall, London, in the year 1741.\r\nHe was the youngest son of the Reverend Dr. Arthur Young, Prebendary\r\nof Canterbury Cathedral, Rector of Bradfield, and of Anne Lucretia,\r\ndaughter of John de Cousmaker, a Dutchman who accompanied William of\r\nOrange to England. From his father Arthur inherited good looks and\r\nliterary talent; and from his mother the love of learning and\r\nbrilliant and pleasing speech.\r\n\r\nMrs. Young brought her clerical husband a large dowry, much of which\r\nwas swallowed up in the vortex of his debts, and later, on his death,\r\nin promoting the agricultural schemes of her gifted but unbusinesslike\r\nson. His home from the first, and for the most part of his life, was\r\nBradfield Hall in the County of Suffolk--a property which had been in\r\nthe hands of the Young family since the year 1672. After a visit to\r\nBradfield, reached from Marks Tey on the Great Eastern Railway, you do\r\nnot wonder at Young's early love of rural life. A broad, winding,\r\nelm-bordered road, meadows knee-deep in wild flowers and waving\r\ngrasses, tangled hedges of eglantine and honeysuckle, rustling\r\ncornfields and silent woods--these, all these, were the sweet pathways\r\nto his home.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seven the lad was sent to the Grammar School at Lavenham\r\nin order to learn the Greek and Latin languages, together with writing\r\nand arithmetic. Owing to the indulgence of a fond mother, his\r\nattendance at his classes was irregular, and neither the centurions of\r\nCæsar nor the wooers of Penelope were able to beguile him from his\r\npony, his pointer and his gun. But the cheapness of his board and\r\nschooling would delight the hearts of many parents in the Transvaal\r\nand elsewhere in the year of grace 1912. Here is the bill:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Rev. Dr. Young to John Coulter (Master of Lavenham School),\r\n     Xmas, 1750 to Xmas, 1751. A year's board, etc., £15. Sundries, £2\r\n     4_s._ 4_d._ Total, £17 4_s._ 4_d._\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving Lavenham, he was apprenticed, at the wish of his mother,\r\nto a wine-merchant at Lynn. He deserted his new work. He was fond of\r\nmusic and the drama. He excelled in dancing, but was always a diligent\r\nscholar.\r\n\r\nHis income, in those days, was not excessive, being thirty pounds per\r\nannum: but his foppery in dress deprived him of the means wherewith to\r\npurchase his beloved books. Accordingly, he wrote a pamphlet entitled\r\n\"The Theatre of the Present War in North America,\" for which he\r\nreceived ten pounds' worth of books from the publisher. More balls\r\ncompelled him to compile more political pamphlets in order to procure\r\nmore books. In the year 1759, at the age of eighteen, he left the\r\ncounting house at Lynn, as he tells us in his own words, \"without\r\neducation, pursuits, profession or employment.\" That same year his\r\nfather died much in debt.\r\n\r\nHe next went to London and started at his own expense a monthly\r\nmagazine called \"The Universal Museum.\" It failed, and he returned\r\nhome. All his wealth was now summed up in a freehold farm of twenty\r\nacres. His mother owned eighty acres at Bradfield. She persuaded him\r\nto reside with her and to manage the farm. He had no knowledge of\r\nagriculture, but he accepted, and tells the story in his own words:\r\n\"Young, eager, and totally ignorant of every necessary detail, it is\r\nnot surprising that I squandered large sums under golden dreams of\r\nimprovement.\" At the age of twenty-four he married Miss Martha Allen\r\nof Lynn. One of his biographers says: \"The marriage brought him an\r\nenviable connection--troops of friends, a passport into brilliant\r\ncircles, but no fireside happiness. The lady was evidently of a\r\ncaptious disposition, shrewish temper and narrow sympathies.\" Another\r\nbiographer writes: \"A loving son, a devoted father, Young was an\r\nindifferent husband.\"\r\n\r\nHaving failed to make a success of his first farm, Young, nothing\r\ndaunted, undertook the cultivation of Sampford Hall in Essex. This\r\nfarm consisted of 300 acres of good arable land. But want of practical\r\nknowledge, and want of capital, drove him from it, and after a five\r\nyears' tenancy he paid a farmer £100 to take it off his hands. His\r\nsuccessor made a fortune on it. But during these five years Young had\r\nmade a large number of experiments, the results of which he afterwards\r\npublished in two large volumes under the title of \"A Course of\r\nExperimental Agriculture.\" Still unshaken in his love of the soil, he\r\nsought another farm, and the quest furnished materials for his \"Six\r\nWeeks' Tour through the Southern Counties,\" a very popular work which\r\nran through several editions. It was at this time that on the advice\r\nof his Suffolk bailiff he took a farm of one hundred acres at North\r\nMimms in Hertfordshire. This property had a good house, but that seems\r\nto have been all. He was deceived by seeing it in a specially good\r\nseason. This speculation proved worse than the last; but his\r\npicturesque pen never failed: \"I know what epithet to give this soil.\r\nSterility falls short of the idea--a hungry, vitriolic gravel. I\r\noccupied for nine years the jaws of a wolf.\" The simple fact was that\r\nwhenever he put pen to paper he was successful; whenever he turned to\r\npractical farming he was a ruined man.\r\n\r\nHe continued to write. His publisher called for more tours. His\r\nreceipts were considerable, yet we find him recording: \"No carthorse\r\never laboured as I did at this period, spending like an idiot, always\r\nin debt, in spite of what I earned with the sweat of my brow, and\r\nalmost my heart's blood--the year's receipts £1,167.\" About this time\r\nhe wrote \"Observations on the Present State of the Waste Lands of\r\nGreat Britain,\" and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Finding\r\nthat he could not make enough to live on at farming, he accepted an\r\nappointment as Parliamentary Reporter for the \"Morning Post\" at five\r\nguineas a week--a most incongruous job for a farmer since it compelled\r\nhim to be absent from his home during six days of the week. Yet he\r\nretained it for several years--walking seventeen miles down to his\r\nfarm every Saturday evening and returning to London every Monday\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1784 Young began the publication of the \"Annals of\r\nAgriculture\"--a monthly publication which ran through forty-five\r\nvolumes. These annals covered the whole field of Agriculture in the\r\nform of letters and essays from the most eminent ruralists of the age.\r\nBut more than a fourth part of the whole series came from the editor's\r\nceaseless pen. Even the King was persuaded to contribute two letters\r\nunder the _nom de plume_ of \"Ralph Robinson,\" his Windsor shepherd.\r\nYoung related with much pride that His Majesty said to him one day on\r\nthe terrace of Windsor: \"Mr. Young, I consider myself as more obliged\r\nto you than to any other man in my Dominions\"; while the Queen\r\nobserved that they never travelled without a copy of the \"Annals\" in\r\nthe Royal carriage. These volumes created quite a stir in European\r\ncircles, and from all parts of the Continent there flocked scholars to\r\nstudy at the feet of the Abelard of English Agriculture. A year later\r\nYoung's mother died and Bradfield Hall and farm became his property.\r\n\r\nIf Tull was the founder of dry-farming, and Coke the father of the\r\nexperimental farm, Young was unquestionably the author of the\r\nagricultural tour. From his fertile pen flowed \"The Southern,\" \"The\r\nNorthern,\" and \"The Eastern Tours,\" together with \"The Tour in\r\nIreland.\" The first three tours were translated into Russian by the\r\nexpress command of the Empress Catherine, who at the same time sent\r\nseveral young Russians to reside at Bradfield for instruction in\r\nBritish agriculture. It was his own opinion that the most useful\r\nfeature of the tours was the practical information which they gave on\r\nthe important subject of the correct courses of crops, on which all\r\npreceding writers had been silent. His most famous and most popular\r\nwork was his \"Travels in France during the years 1787, 1788 and\r\n1789.\"\r\n\r\nYet these remarkable journeys were fore-shadowed twenty years before\r\nin a little book he wrote entitled \"The Farmer's Letters to the People\r\nof England,\" in which he says: \"The nobility and men of large fortune\r\ntravel, but no farmers; unfortunately, those who have this peculiar\r\nand distinguishing advantage, the noble opportunity of benefiting\r\nthemselves and their country, seldom enquire or even think about\r\nagriculture.\"\r\n\r\nThen comes a sketch of a farmer's tour with the routes laid down for\r\nthe imaginary traveller, being precisely those roads he himself was to\r\nfollow two decades later.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1787 he received a pressing invitation from a Polish\r\nfriend in Paris to join the Count de la Rochefoucauld in a tour of the\r\nPyrenees. \"This was touching a string tremulous to vibrate,\" he\r\nwrites: \"I had long wished for an opportunity to examine France.\" His\r\ntravels in France were the sensation of the hour. No one had done\r\nquite the same thing before. He was an eye-witness of the moving\r\nscenes which ushered in the French Revolution. His name was in\r\neverybody's mouth. He received invitations to Courts and salons.\r\nAll the learned societies enrolled him as a member. His work was\r\ntranslated into a score of languages. Princes, statesmen, scientists,\r\nmen of letters, simple farmers and plain peasants paid a visit to\r\nBradfield. Among his correspondents we note the names of Washington,\r\nPitt. Burke, Wilberforce, Lafayette, Priestly and Jeremy Bentham. So\r\nit happened that when the affluent Coke of Norfolk was holding a\r\nContinental sheep-shearing salon at Holkham, his indigent neighbour,\r\nfifty miles to the south, was holding a European levee to discuss the\r\nfundamental principles of rural economy.\r\n\r\nFour years later Young's heart was broken by the death of his\r\nfavourite daughter, \"Bobbin\" at the early age of fourteen. He\r\ndeveloped religious melancholia, shunned society, left his Journal\r\nblank and brooded over sermons. His sight began to fail. He was\r\noperated on for cataract. Wilberforce, warned to be careful, went, a\r\nweek later, to see him in the darkened room. In his sweet and elegant\r\nvoice the Great Emancipator spoke feelingly of the death of a mutual\r\nfriend. Young burst into tears and became for ever blind. The\r\nremainder of his life was spent in preaching the Gospel to the\r\npeasantry and in works of charity. He died in the eightieth year of\r\nhis age in Sackville Street, London, and was buried at Bradfield,\r\nApril, 1820.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in this brief article to do more than mention the\r\nwritings of Young. These we must reserve for a subsequent paper. Our\r\nlibrary is far from complete, yet we possess sixty-six volumes of his\r\nsparkling prose, which, placed one upon another, attain to a height of\r\nnine feet--a monument of amazing industry. True, he was not exempt\r\nfrom those petty jealousies which so often mar the character of\r\neminent men. He tried to snatch some credit for the Board of\r\nAgriculture from Sir John Sinclair, and he scoffed at the idea that\r\nJethro Tull had invented the corn-drill. He met and conversed with the\r\ngreatest savants of the age, yet his mind never burst the old wine\r\nbottles which he served out in the Suffolk store. And so he arrogantly\r\nsays that Canada and Nova Scotia are not worth colonising. \"If they\r\ncontinue poor, they will be no markets. If rich they will revolt; and\r\nthat perhaps is the best thing they can do for our interest.\" ...\r\n\"The loss of India must come. It ought to come.\" Yet with all his\r\nfoolish fancies what a splendid life! For he was the Prophet of the\r\nNew Agriculture in the Valley of Dry Bones. And England may well write\r\nthe epitaph of her illustrious son in the words of Ezekiel: \"This land\r\nthat was desolate is become like the Garden of Eden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN SINCLAIR: FOUNDER OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest recollections of the writer's childhood as he\r\nfished for trout in the Swiney Burn in the far North of Scotland, was\r\nthe tale of a certain wonderful man that was wont to tie little shoes\r\non the feet of his sheep in order to keep them warm while walking\r\nthrough the snow. But many a trout had to be caught, and many a ripple\r\nof the shining river had to pass beneath the Thurso Bridge ere he\r\nlearned the name of the strange person who struck his childish fancy\r\nas he looked up from his quivering line into the wistful eyes of a\r\nCheviot ewe on the lonely, wine-red, moor.\r\n\r\nSir John Sinclair, the founder of the British Board of Agriculture,\r\nwas born in Thurso Castle in the county of Caithness, on May 10th,\r\n1754. His father, George Sinclair, the Laird of Ulbster, was a\r\ndescendant of the Earls of Caithness and Orkney; while his mother,\r\nLady Janet Sutherland of Dunrobin, was the sister of the sixteenth\r\nEarl of that name. As a child he was carefully and wisely trained by\r\nhis parents. From his father, a man of literary tastes and deeply\r\nreligious character, he inherited a love of books; and from his gentle\r\nmother, he learned the lesson that life is not an empty dream; and her\r\nlad was soon to be known as \"the most indefatigable man in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nJohn was educated at the Royal School of Edinburgh, and at the\r\nUniversity of the same city which he entered at the early age of\r\nthirteen. He also studied at Glasgow, and at Trinity College, Oxford.\r\nHe was called to the Bar in 1782. His father died suddenly when John\r\nwas sixteen, and he found himself heir to Estates comprising some\r\n100,000 acres, mainly bleak and barren moor. He at once began to\r\nimprove his property.\r\n\r\nScottish agriculture was then in a most backward state. The fields\r\nwere unenclosed, the lands were undrained. The small farmers of\r\nCaithness were so poor that they could hardly afford to keep a horse,\r\nor even a Shetland pony. The burdens were chiefly borne by women.\r\nIndeed, according to Smiles, if a cottar lost a horse, it was not\r\nunusual for him to marry a wife as the cheapest substitute.\r\n\r\nThe country was without roads or bridges. Drovers taking their cattle\r\nto the South had to swim rivers alongside their beasts. The chief\r\ntrack leading into the country lay along the high shelf of a mountain\r\ncalled Ben Cheilt; the path being several hundred feet above the\r\nstorm-tossed sea, which thundered on the rocks below.\r\n\r\nImagine the loud laughter of the elders of this community when they\r\nheard a rumour that young Sinclair proposed to build in a single day a\r\nroad over this hitherto impassable hill. But John surveyed the road\r\nhimself, and ordered up the Statute labour. At that time the law\r\ndecreed that all capable inhabitants of the agricultural class should\r\nwork on the roads for six days in every year. And so, early one summer\r\nmorning, he assembled the neighbouring farmers and their servants--a\r\ntotal of 1,260. Each party, on arrival, was assigned a certain piece\r\nof the path where they found tools and provisions awaiting them. At\r\nsunset of the same evening the youth drove his carriage and pair over\r\nsix miles of mountain road which the night before had been a dangerous\r\nsheep-track. Tidings of this exploit by a stripling of eighteen spread\r\nfar and wide, and spurred the sleeping spirit of the North.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-six, John Sinclair was elected member of\r\nParliament for the county of Caithness, and remained in the House of\r\nCommons for upwards of thirty years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great monument to Sinclair's indefatigable industry is his\r\n\"Statistical Account of Scotland\" in twenty-one volumes, one of the\r\nmost valuable works on agriculture ever published in any country. It\r\ntook seven years and seven months of incessant labour to complete. It\r\nwas then that the word \"statistics\" and \"statistical\" were first\r\nintroduced into the English language by Sinclair. He made use of the\r\nclergy to obtain the information he desired. He sent a circular letter\r\nto each parish minister in Scotland with 160 questions under four\r\nheads: (1) Geography and Natural History. (2) Population. (3)\r\nProduction. (4) Miscellaneous subjects.\r\n\r\nIn the collection of data many difficulties occurred. Some of the\r\nclergy scorned the idea that one man could collect and collate all\r\nthis information: others were lazy both in mind and body: and some\r\nwere old and infirm. Several parishes were vacant, some too huge to\r\nfully cover, many were without roads, and not a few separated by\r\ntempestuous arms of the sea. To overcome these obstacles he enlisted\r\nthe aid of the leaders of the Church of Scotland, of which he was a\r\nmember, and the great landowners, and as a last resort he employed\r\nstatistical missionaries to supply the missing information. He\r\ngenerously assigned all the profits of this publication to the\r\nScottish Fund for the benefit of the sons of the clergy, and obtained\r\nfor that Society a Royal grant of £2,000. Among the direct results of\r\nthis work was the raising of the stipends of ministers and\r\nschoolmasters--surely a convincing reply to his critics in the\r\nmanses--the abolition of what was then called thirlage or the\r\ncompulsory grinding of corn at a particular mill. Charles Abbot,\r\nafterwards Lord Colchester, the originator of the census of England,\r\nwrote to Sinclair: \"Your success suggested to me the idea,\" and the\r\nvarious bureaux of statistics in the United States and other countries\r\ncan be directly traced to the influence of his treatise.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1788 Sinclair founded the Wool Society. For some time he\r\nhad been wondering why Shetland wool was so extremely fine. Meeting at\r\nthe General Assembly in Edinburgh a Shetland minister, he put the\r\nquestion to him and obtained much valuable information which he at\r\nonce laid before the Highland Society. This led him to form the\r\nBritish Wool Society. It was inaugurated by a grand sheep-shearing\r\nfestival at Newhall's Inn, Queensferry, near Edinburgh, in the year\r\n1791. To Sinclair, therefore, belongs the credit of initiating the\r\nsheep-shearing contests which a few years later developed into Coke's\r\nfamous \"clippings,\" and which were the precursors of our present\r\nagricultural shows. The first agricultural show was held by the\r\nHighland and Agricultural Society at Edinburgh in 1822. It was the\r\nLong Hill sheep of the East Border that Sinclair re-christened by the\r\nnow famous name of Cheviot. These sheep soon became naturalised all\r\nover the north of Scotland, and in a short time the rent of sheep\r\nfirms rose to fabulous prices. Pastures of little value under\r\ncoarse-woolled sheep yielded large returns. As an illustration of\r\nthe practical value of his improvements it may be mentioned that\r\nSinclair's estate of Langwell, which he had bought for £8,000,\r\nhe afterwards sold for £40,000: while the estate of Reay in\r\nSutherlandshire was purchased at £300,000. The name Cheviot comes\r\nfrom the range of rounded or cone-shaped hills growing a superior\r\npasture on the Scottish and English border.\r\n\r\nIn the opening lines of this article I spoke of a childish tale about\r\nsheep-shearing. That this legend is not mere fiction may be seen in\r\nthe following letter of Arthur Young (see Autobiography of Arthur\r\nYoung, page 159): \"From Sir J. Sinclair on clothing for sheep which\r\nhe sent and desired me to buy. I did so, and the rest of the flock\r\ntook them, I suppose, for beasts of prey, and fled in all directions,\r\ntill the clothed sheep, jumping hedges and ditches, soon derobed\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his third lecture in the \"Crown of Wild Olives,\" Ruskin points out\r\nthat all the pure and noble arts of peace are founded on war. It is\r\nworth while, therefore, to note that the British Board of Agriculture\r\nwas established when Britain was engaged in the supreme struggle with\r\nFrance, which terminated on the field of Waterloo, that the National\r\nDepartment of Agriculture in the United States was inaugurated in\r\nthe midst of the Civil War, and that the Transvaal Department of\r\nAgriculture was commenced ere peace was signed at Vereeniging. In\r\nthe year 1793 Sinclair's services in restoring commercial confidence\r\nduring the crisis which occurred at the outbreak of the French War\r\nwere recognised by Pitt, who sent for him to come to Downing Street,\r\nthanked him on behalf of the Government, and asked him if there was\r\nanything that he desired. Sinclair replied that he sought no favours\r\nfor himself, but the most gratifying of all would be the establishment\r\nby Parliament of a great National Corporation to be called \"The Board\r\nof Agriculture.\" In due course the Board was successfully established\r\nwith the King as Patron, Sinclair as President, and Arthur Young as\r\nSecretary. The annual Parliamentary grant was £3,000.\r\n\r\nIn this brief review we have no space to follow the fortune of the\r\nBoard to the date of the retirement of its inspiring founder, down to\r\nthe time when it returned £42,000 to the Treasury--not knowing how to\r\nspend it--till it finally faded away in the year 1822. Yet the Board\r\naccomplished much imperishable work. It carried out agricultural\r\nsurveys, published several volumes of \"communications,\" promoted prize\r\nessays on rural topics, encouraged Elkington, the father of drainage,\r\nMacadam the road-maker, and Meikle, the inventor of the threshing\r\nmachine, and arranged lectures by Sir Humphry Davy on agricultural\r\nchemistry, and by Young on tillage.\r\n\r\nThe north of Scotland at that period owed much to Sinclair. In 1782\r\nhe saved the inhabitants from a serious famine by obtaining a\r\nParliamentary grant of £15,000. In the same year, along with some\r\nother patriots, he secured the repeal of the law which for\r\nthirty-seven years--since the Rebellion of 1745--had forbidden the\r\nuse of the kilt.\r\n\r\nSinclair was an enthusiastic tree-planter in a country which was once\r\nwittily described by an American visitor as a \"Great Clearing.\" He\r\nrebuilt Thurso, and founded the herring fisheries at Wick. To ensure\r\nthe success of this industry he imported Dutch fishermen to teach the\r\nCaithnessmen the art of catching and curing herrings. He introduced\r\nimproved methods of tillage, a regular rotation of crops, and the\r\ncultivation of turnips, clover, and rye-grass. One of his many schemes\r\nwas a General Enclosure Bill, his toast at agricultural gatherings\r\nbeing: \"May a Common become an Uncommon Spectacle in Caithness.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1786 his attachment to William Pitt was rewarded with a baronetcy.\r\nSir John's domestic life was singularly happy. On referring to the old\r\nbook already mentioned, we read: \"He has been twice married to two of\r\nthe most beautiful women in the island. His first lady, a Miss\r\nMaitland, died prematurely in the bloom of youth. His present lady is\r\nthe daughter of the late Lord Macdonald, and by her he has a son,\r\nGeorge, and other children.\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that Sir John loved the limelight, possessed an\r\nunbounded self-conceit, lacked the saving sense of humour, and\r\nover-estimated his own achievements. But these vanities were but the\r\nfitful smoke in the blue flame of a burning energy. What a lesson in\r\nindustry for the youth of South Africa. Fifty years of ceaseless toil,\r\nauthor of thirty-nine volumes and 367 pamphlets. This Scottish\r\nagriculturist died in 1835 at the ripe age of eighty-one, and is\r\nburied according to an ancient family rite, in Holyrood Chapel at\r\nEdinburgh--the friend and confidant of three English kings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nCYRUS H. McCORMICK: INVENTOR OF THE REAPER\r\n\r\n\r\n    _\"I expect to die in harness, because this is not the world for\r\n    rest. This is the world for work. In the next world we will have\r\n    the rest.\"_--Cyrus H. McCormick.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be expected that those people who devoutly chant in a\r\nmillion churches the fourth sentence of the Lord's Prayer should think\r\nwith gratitude of any other person than the Divine Giver of all Good.\r\nYet it is strange to reflect that although every schoolboy knows\r\nsomething of the life of our least Poet Laureate, not one in ten\r\nthousand could tell you the career of the man who responded in a\r\ntruly miraculous manner to the heartfelt, world-voiced matin of both\r\nrich and poor, \"Give us this day our daily bread.\"\r\n\r\nCyrus H. McCormick, the inventor of the reaping machine, was born in\r\nthe eventful year 1809. It was the birth year of Darwin and Tennyson,\r\nof Mendelssohn, Gladstone, and Lincoln. He was born on Walnut Grove\r\nFarm, amidst the mountains of Virginia, one hundred miles from the\r\nsea. He came of that virile stock that has proved to be the main\r\nstrength of the Republic, that gave Washington thirty-nine of his\r\ngenerals, three out of four members of his Cabinet, and three out\r\nof the five judges of the Supreme Court--the Scots who migrated to\r\nUlster, and thence to the United States. Robert McCormick, the father\r\nof Cyrus, was a fairly large farmer, and an inventor of no mean\r\nability. The little log workshop is still shown to the enquiring\r\ntourist where father and son moulded and mended machinery on many a\r\nrainy day. Indeed, we are told that the McCormick homestead was more\r\nlike a small factory than a farmer's home, so full was it of rural\r\nindustries--spinning and weaving, soap and shoes, butter-making and\r\nbacon-curing. And it is more than likely that the ceaseless activity\r\nof his wise and Celtic mother taught Cyrus the value of each moment\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nEver since he was a child of seven it was his father's ambition to\r\ninvent a reaper. He made one, and tried it in the harvest of 1816, but\r\nit proved a failure. It was a fantastic machine, pushed from behind\r\nby two horses. It was highly ingenious, but it would not cut the corn,\r\nand was hauled off the field to become one of the jokes of the\r\ncountryside. Hurt by the jests of his neighbours, he locked the door\r\nof his workshop and toiled away at night. Early in the summer of 1831\r\nhe had so improved his reaper that he gave it another trial. Again it\r\nfailed. True, the machine cut the corn fairly well, but it flung it\r\non the ground in a tangled heap. Satisfied that there was something\r\nradically wrong, Robert McCormick gave up the reaper after having\r\nworked at it for over fifteen years.\r\n\r\nAt this point Cyrus took up the task which his father had reluctantly\r\nabandoned. He showed his genius from the very start by adopting a new\r\nprinciple of operation. First of all, he invented the divider to\r\nseparate the corn to be cut from the corn left standing. Next came the\r\nreciprocating blade, and the fingers, the revolving reel, platform,\r\nand side draught, and, lastly, the big driving wheel. One day late in\r\nthe month of July, in the summer of 1831, Cyrus put a horse between\r\nthe shafts of his reaper. With no spectators save his father and\r\nmother, his brothers and sisters, he drove down to a patch of yellow\r\ngrain. To that little family circle it must have been a moment of\r\nintense excitement. Click, click, click--the white blade shot to and\r\nfro. What a shout of joy! The wheat is cut and falls upon the platform\r\nin a golden, shimmering swathe!\r\n\r\nThus at the early age of twenty-two Cyrus had invented the first\r\npractical reaper that the world had seen. And now began his nine\r\nyears' struggle with adversity, from which he emerged in triumph to\r\nbecome the greatest manufacturer of harvesting machines that America\r\nhas produced. In order to obtain funds with which to manufacture\r\nreapers he started to farm. But he soon found that it was impossible\r\nto raise sufficient capital by this means. Near by was a large\r\ndeposit of iron ore, and he forthwith resolved to build a furnace and\r\nmake iron. He persuaded his father and the school teacher to become\r\nhis partners. For several years the furnace did fairly well, when,\r\nsuddenly, the price of iron fell. The McCormicks were bankrupt. Cyrus\r\ngave up the farm, and stuck grimly to his reaper. One day the village\r\nconstable rode up to the farm door with a summons for a debt of\r\nnine-teen dollars, but he was so impressed with the industry of the\r\nMcCormicks that he had not the heart to serve the notice. It was the\r\ndarkest hour before the dawn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same year (1840) a stranger rode in from the north and drew rein\r\nin front of the little log workshop. He was a rough looking man with\r\nthe homely name of Abraham Smith, but to Cyrus he came as an angel\r\nof light. He had come with fifty dollars in his pocket to buy a\r\nreaper--the first that was ever sold. A short time later two other\r\nfarmers came on the same errand, and that summer three reaping\r\nmachines were working in the wheat-fields of America. In 1842\r\nMcCormick sold seven machines, and in 1844 fifty. The home farm had\r\nnow become a busy factory.\r\n\r\nThree years later a friend said to him \"Cyrus, why don't you go West\r\nwith your reaper, where the land is level and labour cheap?\"\r\n\r\nIt was the call of the West.\r\n\r\nHe travelled over the boundless prairies, and was quick to see that\r\nthis great land-ocean was the natural home of the reaper. Straightway\r\nhe transferred his factory to Chicago--then, in 1847, a forlorn little\r\ntown of less than 10,000 souls. His business flourished. In the\r\ngreat fire of 1871 his factory, which was then turning out 10,000\r\nharvesters a year, was totally destroyed. At the word of his wife he\r\nrebuilt it anew with amazing rapidity. And so we find that the tiny\r\nworkshop in the backwoods of Virginia has become the McCormick City\r\nin the heart of Chicago. In the sixty-five years of its life this\r\nmanufactory has produced over 6,000,000 harvesting machines, and is\r\nnow pouring them out at the rate of over 7,000 per week. The McCormick\r\nCompany is now known as the International Harvester Company, and his\r\neldest son, Cyrus H. McCormick, is the President. The annual output is\r\n75,000,000 dollars. It was the reaper that enabled the United States,\r\nduring the four years of the civil war, not only to feed the armies\r\nin the field, but at the same time to export to foreign countries\r\n200,000,000 bushels of wheat. And well might the savants of the French\r\nAcademy of Science say, when electing Cyrus McCormick a member, that\r\n\"he had done more for the cause of agriculture than any other living\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now we must trace the evolution of the reaper from its origin on\r\nthe Walnut Grove Farm to the marvellous machine of to-day. For about\r\nthirty years it remained practically unaltered in design, save that\r\nseats had been added for the raker and the driver. It did no more than\r\ncut the grain and leave it in loose bundles on the ground. It had\r\nabolished the sickler and cradler, but there still remained the raker\r\nand binder. Might it not be possible to do away with them also, and\r\nleave only the driver? Such was the fascinating problem which now\r\nconfronted the inventor.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1852 a bedridden cripple called Jearum Atkins bought a\r\nMcCormick reaper, and had it placed outside his window. To while away\r\nthe weary hours he actually devised an attachment with two revolving\r\niron arms, which automatically raked off the cut grain from the\r\nplatform to the ground. It was a grotesque contrivance, and was\r\nnicknamed by the farmers the \"iron man.\" Nevertheless, this invention\r\nstimulated the manufacture of self-rake reapers, and soon the American\r\nfarmer would buy no other kind. Thus part of the problem had been\r\nsolved. The raker was abolished. But there still remained the harder\r\ntask of supplanting the binder--the man or the woman who gathered up\r\nthe bundles of cut corn and bound them tightly together with a wisp\r\nof straw into the sheaf.\r\n\r\nAnd now another figure appears upon this ever-moving stage, a young\r\nman by the name of Charles B. Withington. Born at Akron, Ohio, a year\r\nbefore McCormick invented his reaper, this delicate youth was trained\r\nby his father to be a watchmaker. At the age of fifteen, in order to\r\nearn pocket-money, he went into the harvest field to bind corn. He\r\nwas not robust, and the hard, stooping labour under a hot sun would\r\nsometimes bring the blood to his head in a hemorrhage. There were\r\ntimes after the day's work was done when he was too weary to walk\r\nhome, and he would throw himself on the stubble to rest. At eighteen\r\nhe journeyed to the goldfields of California, drifted to Australia,\r\nand in the year 1855 arrived back in Wisconsin with 3,000 dollars in\r\nhis belt. All this money he began to fritter away in trying to invent\r\na self-rake reaper. Suddenly, inspired by the articles of a rural\r\neditor, who maintained that the binding of corn should be done by a\r\nmachine, Withington dropped his self-rake and went straight to work to\r\nmake a self-binder. He completed his first machine in 1872, but met\r\nwith much discouragement until, two years later, he came across\r\nMcCormick.\r\n\r\nTheir dramatic meeting is best told by Mr. Herbert M. Casson in his\r\ninteresting volume, entitled \"Cyrus Hall McCormick: His Life and\r\nWork.\"\r\n\r\n     \"One evening in 1874 a tall man; with a box under his arm, walked\r\n     diffidently up the steps of the McCormick home in Chicago, and rang\r\n     the bell. He asked to see Mr. McCormick, and was shown into the\r\n     parlour, where he found Mr. McCormick, sitting, as usual, in a\r\n     large and comfortable chair.\r\n\r\n     \"'My name is Withington,' said the stranger; I live in Janesville,\r\n     Wisconsin. I have here a model of a machine that will automatically\r\n     bind grain.'\r\n\r\n     \"Now, it so happened that McCormick had been kept awake nearly the\r\n     whole of the previous night by a stubborn business problem. He\r\n     could scarcely hold his eyelids apart. And when Withington was in\r\n     the midst of his explanation, with the intentness of a born\r\n     inventor, Mr. McCormick fell fast asleep. At such a reception to\r\n     his cherished machine Withington lost heart. He was a gentle,\r\n     sensitive man easily rebuffed, and so, when McCormick aroused from\r\n     his nap, Withington had departed, and was on his way back to\r\n     Wisconsin. For a few seconds McCormick was uncertain as to whether\r\n     his visitor had been a reality or a dream. Then he awoke with a\r\n     start into instant action. A great opportunity had come to him, and\r\n     he had let it slip. He was at this time making self-rake reapers\r\n     and Marsh harvesters; but what he wanted--what every reaper\r\n     manufacturer wanted in 1871--was a self-binder. He at once called\r\n     one of his trusted workmen.\r\n\r\n     \"'I want you to go to Janesville,' he said. Find a man named\r\n     Withington and bring him to me by the first train that comes back\r\n     to Chicago.'\r\n\r\n     \"The next day Withington was brought back, and treated with the\r\n     utmost courtesy. McCormick studied his invention, and found it to\r\n     be a most remarkable mechanism. Two steel arms caught each bundle\r\n     of grain, whirled a wire tightly around it, fastened the two ends\r\n     together with a twist, cut it loose, and tossed it to the ground.\r\n     This self-binder was perfect in all its details--as neat and\r\n     effective a machine as could be imagined. McCormick was delighted.\r\n     At last, here was a machine that would abolish the binding of grain\r\n     by hand.\"\r\n\r\nFor six years all went well with the McCormick and Withington\r\nself-binder. This wonderful wire-twisting machine was working\r\neverywhere with clockwork precision, and was believed to be the best\r\nthat human ingenuity could devise. All at once the manufacturing world\r\nwas startled with the news that William Deering had made and sold\r\nthree thousand twine self-binders. Deering, by this dramatic move\r\nbecame in a flash McCormick's most powerful competitor. He was not a\r\nfarmer's son, like the latter, being bred in the city and trained in a\r\nfactory. He had been a successful merchant at Maine, then left it to\r\nenter the harvester trade. He staked his whole fortune on making twine\r\nbinders. He won, and McCormick was forced to follow in his wake. The\r\nevolution of the reaper into the twine self-binder was an epoch-making\r\nevent in the agricultural world. It enormously increased the sales. In\r\n1880, 60,000 reapers were sold; five years later the figures had risen\r\nto 250,000. Since then, with the exception of the new knot-tying\r\ndevice, there has been no real change in the reaper. It remains the\r\ngrandest of all agricultural machines, and one of the most astonishing\r\nmechanisms ever devised by the brain of man.\r\n\r\nMcCormick died in 1884. In the span of his own life the reaper was\r\nborn and brought to perfection. He created it in a remote Virginian\r\nvillage, and he lived to see his catalogue printed in twenty\r\nlanguages, and to know that so long as the human race continues to eat\r\nbread the sun will never set on the Empire of his reaper, for\r\nsomewhere, in every month in all the year, you will find the corn\r\nwhite unto the harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nR.
