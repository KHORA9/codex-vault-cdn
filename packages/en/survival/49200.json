Not only are these two sources radically\r\ndistinct in their essential nature, but both are admitted to be real and\r\nnot merely hypothetical sources of energy. The one source is\r\ngravitation; the other, the source discussed in the present volume, a\r\nsource to which attention was directed some twenty years ago. A most\r\nimportant distinction between these two sources is this: the amount of\r\nenergy available from the former can be accurately determined, but such\r\nis not the case in regard to the latter. We can tell with tolerable\r\ncertainty the greatest amount of energy which gravitation could possibly\r\nhave conferred on the sun and solar system; but we have, at present, no\r\nmeans of assigning a limit to the possible amount which might have been\r\nderived from the other source. It may have been equal to that which\r\ngravitation could afford, or it may have been twofold, fourfold, or even\r\ntenfold that amount.\r\n\r\nWe have evidently in this case a means of determining which of the two\r\nsources will ultimately have to be adopted as the source to which the\r\nenergy of our solar system must be referred. For if it can be proved\r\nfrom the admitted facts of geology, biology, and other sciences, that\r\nthe amount of energy in the form of heat which has been radiated into\r\nspace by the sun during geological time is far greater than the amount\r\nwhich could possibly have been derived from gravitation, this will\r\nundoubtedly show that gravitation cannot account for the energy\r\noriginally possessed by our system.\r\n\r\nThe First Part of the volume is devoted to the consideration of what I\r\nbelieve to be the probable origin of meteorites, comets, and nebulæ, and\r\nof the real source from which our sun derived his energy. The facts\r\nwhich support the theory here advocated, together with the light which\r\nthat theory appears to cast upon those facts, are next considered; and\r\nit will be found, I think, that the theory has been very much\r\nstrengthened by the recent important spectroscopic researches of Mr.\r\nLockyer and others in reference to the constitution of nebulæ. The\r\nSecond Part of the work deals with the evidence in support of the theory\r\nderived from the testimony of geology and biology as to the age of the\r\nsun’s heat. The Third, and last, Part has been devoted to questions\r\nrelating to the pre-nebular condition of the universe, and the bearing\r\nwhich these have on theories of stellar evolution. Several subjects\r\nintroduced in this part are only very briefly treated. These will,\r\nhowever, be considered at greater length in a future volume,\r\n“Determinism, not Force, the Foundation-stone of Evolution,” a work of a\r\nmore general and abstract character, which was commenced many years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n      PERTH: _January 2, 1889_.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                PART I.\r\n\r\n               _THE IMPACT THEORY OF STELLAR EVOLUTION._\r\n\r\n                                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n   CONSIDERATION OF THE FACTS WHICH SUPPORT THE THEORY, AND OF\r\n     THE LIGHT WHICH THE THEORY APPEARS TO CAST UPON THE FACTS     12\r\n\r\n\r\n      I.

The probability of this theory has been very much strengthened\r\nby the facts, both astronomical and physical, which have accumulated\r\nsince the theory was enunciated. Before proceeding to the consideration\r\nof these facts, and the conclusions to which they lead, it will be\r\nnecessary to give a statement of the fundamental principles of the\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Philosophical Magazine_, May 1868; _Climate and Time_,\r\nchap. xxi.; _Quarterly Journal of Science_, July 1877; _Phil. Mag._,\r\nJuly 1878; _Climate and Cosmology_, chaps. xvii. xviii. and xix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I prefer to use the term “theory,” with the above\r\nunderstood qualification, viz. a theory in its hypothetical stage.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the theory here discussed the truth of the nebular hypothesis, which\r\nbegins by assuming the existence of a solar nebulous mass, is taken for\r\ngranted. The present theory deals not so much with the nebulous mass\r\nitself as with the _formation_ of the nebula, and with those causes\r\nwhich led to its formation. For convenience of reference, and to prevent\r\nconfusion, I have called it the “Impact Theory,” by which name it may be\r\ndistinguished, on the one hand, from the nebular theory, and, on the\r\nother hand, from the meteoric theory, and all other theories which\r\nregard gravitation as the primary source of the solar energy.\r\n\r\nThe theory starts with the assumption that the greater part of the\r\nenergy possessed by the universe exists or is stored up in the form of\r\nthe motion of stellar masses. The amount of energy which may thus be\r\nstored up is startling to contemplate. Thus a mass equal to that of the\r\nsun, moving with a velocity of 476 miles per second, would possess, in\r\nvirtue of that motion, energy sufficient, if converted into heat, to\r\nmaintain the present rate of the sun’s radiation for 50,000,000\r\nyears.[3] There is nothing extravagant in the assumption of such a\r\nvelocity. A comet, for example, having an orbit extending to the path of\r\nthe planet Neptune, approaching so near the sun as to almost graze his\r\nsurface in passing, would have a velocity within 86 miles of what we\r\nhave assumed. Twice this assumed velocity would give 200,000,000 years’\r\nheat; four times the velocity would give 800,000,000 years’ heat; and so\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Pouillet’s estimate of the rate of solar radiation is here\r\ntaken.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are at perfect liberty to begin by assuming the existence of stellar\r\nmasses in motion; for we are not called upon to explain how the masses\r\nobtained their motion, any more than we have to explain how they came to\r\nhave their existence. If the masses were created, they may as likely\r\nhave been created in motion as at rest; and if they were eternal, they\r\nmay as likely have been eternally in motion as eternally at rest.\r\n\r\nEternal motion is just as warrantable an assumption as eternal matter.\r\nWhen we reflect that space is infinite—at least in thought—and that, for\r\naught we know to the contrary, bodies may be found moving throughout its\r\nevery region, we see that the amount of energy may be perfectly\r\nillimitable.\r\n\r\nBut, illimitable as the amount of the energy may be, it could be of no\r\ndirect service while it existed simply as the motion of stellar masses.\r\nThe motion, to be available, must be transformed into heat: the motion\r\nof translation into molecular, or some other form of motion. This can be\r\ndone in no other way than by arresting the motion of the masses. But how\r\nis such motion to be arrested? How are bodies as large as our earth,\r\nmoving at the rate of hundreds of miles per second, to have their motion\r\nstopped? According to the theory this is effected by _collision_: by\r\nemploying the motion of the one body to arrest that of the other.\r\n\r\nTake the case of the formation of our sun according to the theory.\r\nSuppose two bodies, each one-half of the mass of the sun, moving\r\ndirectly towards each other with a velocity of 476 miles per second.\r\nThese bodies would, in virtue of that velocity, possess 4149 × 10^{38}\r\nfoot-pounds of energy, which is equal to 100,000,000,000 foot-pounds per\r\npound of the mass; and this, converted into heat by the stoppage of\r\ntheir motions, would suffice to maintain, as was previously stated, the\r\npresent rate of the sun’s radiation for a period of 50,000,000 years. It\r\nmust be borne in mind that, while 476 miles per second is the velocity\r\nat the moment of collision, more than one-half of this would be derived\r\nfrom the mutual attraction of the two bodies in their approach to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nComing in collision with such a velocity, the result would inevitably be\r\nthat the two bodies would shatter each other to pieces. But, although\r\ntheir onward motions would thus be stopped, it is absolutely impossible\r\nthat the whole of the energy of their motions could be at once converted\r\ninto heat; and it is equally impossible that it could be annihilated.\r\nPhysical considerations enable us to trace, though in a rough and\r\ngeneral way, the results which would necessarily follow. The broken\r\nfragments, now forming one confused mass, would rebound against one\r\nanother, breaking up into smaller fragments, and flying off in all\r\ndirections. As these fragments receded from the centre of dispersion\r\nthey would strike against each other, and, by their mutual impact,\r\nbecome shivered into still smaller fragments, which would in turn be\r\nbroken up into fragments yet smaller, and so on as they proceeded\r\noutwards. This is, however, only one part of the process, and a part\r\nwhich would certainly take place, though no heat were generated by the\r\ncollisions.\r\n\r\nA far more effective means of dispersing the fragments and shattering\r\nthem to pieces would be the expansive force of the enormous amount of\r\nincandescent gas almost instantaneously generated by the heat of\r\ncollision. The general breaking up of the two masses and the stoppage of\r\ntheir motions would be the work of only a few minutes, or a few hours at\r\nmost. The heat evolved by the arrested motion would, in the first\r\ninstance, be mainly concentrated on the surface layers of the broken\r\nblocks. The layers would be at once transformed into the gaseous\r\ncondition, thus enveloping the blocks and filling the interspaces. It is\r\ndifficult to determine what the temperature and expansive force of this\r\ngas would at the moment be, but evidently it would be excessive; for,\r\nwere the whole of the heat of the arrested motion distributed over the\r\nmass, it would, as has been stated, amount to 100,000,000,000\r\nfoot-pounds per pound of the mass—an amount sufficient to raise 264,000\r\ntons of iron 1° C. Thus, if we assume the specific heat of the gas to be\r\nequal to that of air (viz. ·2374), it would have a temperature of about\r\n300,000,000° C. or more than 140,000 times that of the voltaic arc.\r\n\r\nI hardly think it will be deemed extravagant to assume that at the\r\nmoment after impact the temperature of the evolved gas would be at least\r\nas great as here stated. If we assume it to be so, it is obvious that\r\nthe broken mass would, by the expansive force of the generated gas, be\r\ndispersed in all directions, breaking up into fragments smaller and\r\nsmaller as they knocked against one another in their progress outwards\r\nfrom the centre of dispersion; and these fragments would, at the same\r\ntime, become gradually converted into the gaseous state, and gradually\r\ncome to occupy a space as large as that embraced in our solar system. In\r\nthe course of time the whole would assume the gaseous condition, and we\r\nshould then have a perfect nebula—intensely hot, but not very luminous.\r\nAs its temperature diminished, the nebulous mass would begin to\r\ncondense, and ultimately, according to the well-known nebular\r\nhypothesis, pass through all the different phases of rings, planets, and\r\nsatellites into our solar system as it now exists.\r\n\r\nI am glad to find that the theory, in one of its main features, has been\r\nadopted by Sir William Thomson,[4] the highest authority we have on all\r\npoints relating to the source of the sun’s heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Lecture on “The Probable Origin, the Total Amount, and the\r\nPossible Duration of the Sun’s Heat,” delivered at the Royal Institution\r\non January 21, 1887, and published in _Nature_ of 27th of the same\r\nmonth. The lecture was afterwards published with considerable additions\r\nand alterations in the _Proceedings of the Institution_ vol. xii. It is\r\nfrom this that my quotations are taken.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“We cannot,” says Sir William, “help asking the question, What was the\r\ncondition of the sun’s matter before it came together and became hot?\r\n(1) It may have been two cool, solid masses, which collided with the\r\nvelocity due to their mutual gravitation; or (2), but with enormously\r\nless of probability, it may have been two masses colliding with\r\nvelocities considerably greater than the velocities due to their mutual\r\ngravitation.”\r\n\r\nHe adopts the first of these suppositions. “To fix the idea,” he\r\ncontinues, “think of two cool, solid globes, each of the same mean\r\ndensity as the earth, and of half the sun’s diameter, given at rest, or\r\nnearly at rest, at a distance asunder equal to twice the earth’s\r\ndistance from the sun. They will fall together and collide in exactly\r\nhalf a year. The collision will last for about half an hour, in the\r\ncourse of which they will be transformed into a violently agitated\r\nincandescent fluid mass flying outward from the line of the motion\r\nbefore the collision, and swelling to a bulk several times greater than\r\nthe sum of the original bulks of the two globes. How far the fluid mass\r\nwill fly out all around from the line of collision it is impossible to\r\nsay. The motion is too complicated to be fully investigated by any known\r\nmathematical method; but with sufficient patience a mathematician might\r\nbe able to calculate it with some fair approximation to the truth. The\r\ndistance reached by the extreme circular fringe of the fluid mass would\r\nprobably be much less than the distance fallen by each globe before the\r\ncollision, because the translational motion of the molecules\r\nconstituting the heat into which the whole energy of the original fall\r\nof the globes becomes transformed in the first collision is probably\r\nabout three-fifths of the whole amount of that energy. The time of\r\nflying out would probably be less than half a year, when the fluid mass\r\nmust begin to fall in again towards the axis. In something less than a\r\nyear after the first collision the fluid will again be in a state of\r\nmaximum crowding round the centre, and this time probably even more\r\nviolently agitated than it was immediately after the first collision;\r\nand it will again fly outward, but this time axially towards the places\r\nwhence the two globes fell. It will again fall inwards, and after a\r\nrapidly subsiding series of quicker and quicker oscillations it will\r\nsubside, probably in the course of two or three years, into a globular\r\nstar of about the same dimensions, heat, and brightness, as our present\r\nsun, but differing from him in this, that it will have no rotation.”[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Proceedings of the Royal Institution_, vol. xii. p. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what I have been contending for during the past twenty\r\nyears, with the simple exception that I assume, according to his second\r\nsupposition, that the “two masses collided with velocities considerably\r\ngreater than the velocities due to mutual gravitation.” Sir William\r\nadmits, of course, my supposition to be quite a possible one, but\r\nrejects it on the supposed ground of its improbability. His reasons for\r\nthis, stated in his own words, are as follows:\r\n\r\n“This last supposition implies that, calling the two bodies A and B for\r\nbrevity, the motion of the centre of inertia of B relatively to A must,\r\nwhen the distance between them was great, have been directed with great\r\nexactness to pass through the centre of inertia of A; such great\r\nexactness that the rotational momentum or moment of momentum after\r\ncollision was no more than to let the sun have his present slow rotation\r\nwhen shrunk to his present dimensions. This exceedingly exact aiming of\r\nthe one body at the other, so to speak, is, on the dry theory of\r\nprobability, exceedingly improbable. On the other hand, there is\r\ncertainty that the two bodies A and B at rest in space if left to\r\nthemselves, undisturbed by other bodies and only influenced by their\r\nmutual gravitation, shall collide with direct impact, and therefore with\r\nno motion of their centre of inertia, and no rotational momentum of the\r\ncompound body after the collision. Thus we see that the dry probability\r\nof collision between two neighbours of a vast number of mutually\r\nattracting bodies widely scattered through space is much greater if the\r\nbodies be all given at rest than if they be given moving in any random\r\ndirections and with any velocities considerable in comparison with the\r\nvelocities which they would acquire in falling from rest into\r\ncollision.”\r\n\r\nSir William here argues that the second supposition is far less probable\r\nthan the first, because, according to it, the motion of the one body\r\nrelatively to the other must, in order to strike, be directed with great\r\nexactness. The result, in such a case, is that collision will rarely\r\noccur; whereas, according to the first supposition, the two bodies\r\nstarting from a state of rest will, by their mutual gravitation,\r\ninevitably collide. According to the second hypothesis they will\r\ngenerally miss; according to the first they will always collide.\r\n\r\nI have been led to a conclusion directly opposed to Sir William’s. The\r\nfact, that, according to the second supposition, collisions can but\r\nrarely occur is one reason, amongst others, why I think that supposition\r\nto be true; and the fact that, according to the first supposition,\r\ncollisions must frequently occur is also one reason, amongst others, why\r\nI think it very improbable that it can represent the true condition of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIt by no means adds anything to the probability of the first supposition\r\nto assert that, according to it, such collisions will occur readily and\r\nfrequently. On the contrary, it would show that the supposition was the\r\nless likely to be true. If the collisions were insufficient in\r\ncharacter, the fewer of them that occurred, the better; for the result\r\nof such collisions would simply be a waste of the potential energies of\r\nthe universe. We should in this case have an innumerable host of\r\nimperfect suns without planets, or with at most only one or two, and\r\nthese at no great distance from the luminary. There would thus be\r\nevolved a universe without any grand planetary systems. There is still\r\nanother objection to the supposition. The same gravitating force which\r\nmakes the dark bodies liable to come into collision with each other\r\nmust, of course, make them equally liable to come into collision with\r\nthe luminous bodies, and with our sun amongst the rest. Our sun would,\r\naccordingly, be at the mercy of any of those masses which might happen\r\nto come within the reach of its attractive influence. It would pull the\r\nmass towards it, and a collision would be inevitable, unless it so\r\nhappened that a transverse motion of the sun itself might enable it to\r\nescape destruction. Even in such a case it could not by any means manage\r\nto get rid of the entangling mass.\r\n\r\nAll this risk, in so far as gravitation is concerned, would have been\r\ncompletely averted if an original projected velocity of some thirty or\r\nforty miles per second had been conferred on the dark mass; for, in this\r\ncase, the attractive force of the sun would fail to arrest its motion,\r\nand the mass would pass onward through space, never to return. This\r\nsimple conception of an original motion removes entirely those\r\nobjections which, we have seen, besets the supposition we have been\r\nconsidering. With such a motion, not only would the risk to our solar\r\nsystem be removed, but the collisions between the dark bodies themselves\r\nwould be a matter of rare occurrence; and hence the energy of the\r\nuniverse would be conserved. And when a collision did happen it would be\r\non a grand scale, and the result would be not an imperfect sun without\r\nplanets, but an incandescent nebula, out of which, by condensation, a\r\ncomplete solar system would be evolved. In fact, within the whole range\r\nof cosmical physics, I know of nothing more impressive in its sublime\r\nsimplicity than this plan, by which the stability and perfection of the\r\nuniverse is thus secured. How vast the ends—how simple the means!\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSIDERATION OF THE FACTS WHICH SUPPORT THE THEORY, AND OF THE\r\n    LIGHT WHICH THE THEORY APPEARS TO CAST UPON THE FACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  I. _Probable Origin of Meteorites._\r\n\r\nRecent researches establish beyond doubt that stars, nebulæ, comets and\r\nmeteorites, do not differ much from our earth in their chemical\r\nconstitution. Meteorites, it is true, differ in their physical\r\ncharacteristics from ordinary rock such as is found on the earth’s\r\nsurface. But it is possible, if not probable, that the earth’s interior\r\nmass “may,” as Sir Henry Roscoe remarks, “partake of the physical nature\r\nof these metallic meteorites, and that if we could obtain a portion of\r\nmatter from a great depth below the earth’s surface we should find it\r\nexactly corresponding in structure as well as in chemical composition\r\nwith a metallic meteorite, and the existence of such interior masses of\r\nmetallic iron may go far to explain the well-known magnetic condition of\r\nour planet.”[6] I think there can be little doubt that, were our earth\r\nbroken up into small fragments, and these scattered into space, it would\r\nprobably be impossible to distinguish them from ordinary meteorites. The\r\ntwo would be so like in character that one can hardly resist the\r\nconviction that meteorites are but the fragments of sidereal masses\r\nwhich have been shattered by collision. That meteorites are broken\r\nfragments is the opinion expressed by Sir William Thomson, who says\r\n“that he cannot but agree with the common opinion which regards\r\nmeteorites as fragments broken from larger masses, and that we cannot be\r\nsatisfied without trying to imagine what were the antecedents of those\r\nmasses.” The theory we have been considering appears to afford an\r\nexplanation of their antecedents. According to it, they are broken\r\nfragments of two dark stellar masses which were shattered to pieces by\r\ncollision. After what has been stated concerning the production of the\r\ngaseous nebulæ out of which our solar system was formed, it must be\r\nregarded as highly improbable, if not impossible, that the whole of the\r\nfragments projected outwards with such velocity should be converted into\r\nthe gaseous condition. Multitudes of the smaller fragments, especially\r\nthose towards the outer circumference of the nebulous mass, meeting with\r\nlittle or no obstruction to their onward progress, would pass outwards\r\ninto space with a velocity which would carry them beyond the risk of\r\nfalling back into the nebula. They would then continue their progress in\r\ntheir separated forms as meteorites. If this be their origin, then\r\nmeteorites are the offspring of sidereal masses, and not their parents,\r\nas Mr. Lockyer concludes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Manchester Science Lectures_, Fifth Series, p. 31.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese meteorites must be of vast antiquity, for if they are fragments of\r\nthe dark bodies then they must be not only older than our solar system,\r\nbut older than the nebula from which that system was formed. Some of\r\nthem, however, may have come from other systems. They are fragments\r\nwhich may yet cast some light on the history of the dark bodies.\r\n\r\nComets, bodies which in many points seem allied to meteorites, probably\r\nhave, as we shall shortly see, a similar origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n II. _Motion of the Stars; how of such different velocities, and always\r\n    in straight lines._\r\n\r\nIt will be only when the two bodies, coming from contrary directions,\r\ncollide with equal momentum that the entire motion will be stopped. But\r\nin the case of stellar masses moving, as it were, at random in every\r\ndirection this is a condition which will but rarely occur. Accordingly,\r\nin most cases the resulting stars will have more or less motion. In\r\nshort, the stars should, according to the theory, be moving in all\r\ndirections and with all varieties of velocity. Further, it follows that\r\nthese motions ought to be in perfectly straight lines, and not in\r\ndefinite orbits of any kind. So far as observation has yet determined,\r\nall these conditions seem to be fulfilled. Sometimes it will happen that\r\nthe two bodies will strike each other obliquely. In this case the\r\nresulting star, both as to the direction and velocity of its motion,\r\nwill, to a large extent, be the resultant of the two concurrent forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. _Motion of the Stars not due to their Mutual Attractions._\r\n\r\nAccording to the theory the absolute motion of the stars is due, not to\r\nthe influence of gravity, but to motions which originally belonged to\r\nthe two component masses out of which the star arose; motion regarding\r\nthe origin of which science can no more inform us than it can regarding\r\nthe origin of the masses themselves. There is strong presumptive\r\nevidence that the motion of the stars is due to this cause. We know that\r\nthere are stars which have a far greater velocity than can result from\r\ngravitation, such, for example, as the star 1830 Groombridge, which has\r\na velocity of 200 miles per second. Suppose, with Professor Newcomb,\r\nthat the number of stars belonging to the universe amounts to\r\n100,000,000, and that these have, on the average, five times the mass of\r\nthe sun, and are spread out in a layer across which light requires\r\n30,000 years to pass. Then computation shows that, unless the attractive\r\npower of the whole were sixty-four times greater than it really is, it\r\ncould not have conferred on Groombridge the motion which it possesses,\r\nor arrest it in its onward course.[7] We are therefore forced, as\r\nProfessor Newcomb remarks, to one of two alternatives, viz.: “Either the\r\nbodies which compose our universe are vastly more massive and numerous\r\nthan telescopic examination seems to indicate, or 1830 Groombridge is a\r\nrunaway star, flying on a boundless course through infinite space, with\r\nsuch momentum that the attraction of all the bodies of the universe can\r\nnever stop it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Newcomb’s _Astronomy_, p. 487, English edition, 1878.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs regards the theory we are discussing, it is the same which\r\nalternative is taken, for both are equally favourable. If the former,\r\nthen, according to the theory that stellar heat had its origin in\r\ncollision, it is presumptive evidence that space is occupied by dark\r\nbodies far more numerous and massive than the luminous ones which the\r\ntelescope reveals. If the latter, viz. that the star has a velocity\r\nwhich never could have been produced by attraction, “then,” as says\r\nProfessor Newcomb, “it must have been flying forward through space from\r\nthe beginning, and, having come from an infinite distance, must now be\r\npassing through our system for the first and only time.” The probability\r\nis, however, that the star derived its motion from the source from which\r\nit derived its light and heat; namely, from the collision of the two\r\nmasses out of which it arose. If the star is ever to be arrested in its\r\nonward course, it must be by collision; but such an event would be its\r\nfinal end.\r\n\r\nThere are other stars, such as 61 Cygni, ε Indi, Lalande 21258, Lalande\r\n21185, μ Cassiopeiæ, and Arcturus, possessed of motions which could not\r\nhave been derived from gravity. And there are probably many more of\r\nwhich, owing to their enormous distances, the proper motions have not\r\nbeen detected. α Centauri, the nearest star in the heavens, by less than\r\none-half, is distant twenty-one millions of millions of miles; and there\r\nare, doubtless, many visible stars a thousand times more remote. A star\r\nat this distance, though moving transversely to the observer at the\r\nenormous rate of 100 miles per second, would take upwards of thirty\r\nyears to change its position so much as one second, and consequently\r\n1,800 years to change its position one minute. In fact, we should have\r\nto watch the star for a generation or two before we could be certain\r\nwhether it was moving or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    IV. _Probable Origin of Comets._\r\n\r\nGreat difficulty has been experienced in accounting for the origin of\r\ncomets upon the nebular hypothesis. They approach the sun from all\r\ndirections, and their motions, in relation to the planets, are as often\r\nretrograde as direct. Not only are their orbits excessively elliptical,\r\nbut they are also inclined to the ecliptic at all angles from 0° to 90°.\r\nIt is evidently impossible to account satisfactorily for the origin of\r\ncomets if we assume them all to have been evolved out of the solar\r\nnebula, although this has been attempted by M. Faye and others. Comets\r\nare evidently, as Laplace and Professor A. Winchell both conclude,\r\nstrangers to our system, and have come from distant regions of space. If\r\nthey belonged to the solar system they could not, says Professor\r\nWinchell, have parabolic and hyperbolic paths. “Only a small portion of\r\nthe comets,” he remarks, “are known to move in elliptic orbits.”[8] This\r\nassumption that they are foreigners will account for all the\r\npeculiarities of their motions; but how are we to account for their\r\ncoming into our system? How did they manage to leave that system in\r\nwhich they had their origin? If a comet have come from one of the fixed\r\nstars trillions of miles distant, the motion by which it traversed the\r\nintervenient space could not, possibly, have been derived from gravity.\r\nWe are therefore obliged to assume that the motion was a projected\r\nmotion. Comets, in all probability, have the same origin as meteorites.\r\nThe materials composing them, like those of the meteorites, were\r\nprobably projected from nebulæ by the expulsive force of the heat of\r\nconcussion which produced the nebulæ. Some of them, especially those\r\nwith elliptic orbits, may have possibly been projected from the solar\r\nnebula.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _World Life._ p. 27.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              V. _Nebulæ._\r\n\r\nIt is a curious circumstance that the theory here advanced seems to\r\nafford a rational explanation of almost every peculiarity of nebulæ, as\r\nI have, on former occasions, endeavoured, at some length, to prove.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Philosophical Magazine_, July 1878; _Climate and\r\nCosmology_, Chap. xix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Origin of nebulæ._—We have already seen that the theory affords a\r\nrational account of the origin of nebulæ.\r\n\r\n2. _How nebulæ occupy so much space._—It accounts for the enormous\r\n_space_ occupied by nebulæ. It may be objected that, enormous as would\r\nbe the original temperature of the solar system produced by the primeval\r\ncollision, it would nevertheless be insufficient to expand the mass,\r\nagainst gravity, to such an extent that it would occupy the entire space\r\nincluded within the orbit of Neptune. But it will be perceived, from\r\nwhat has already been stated regarding the dispersion of the materials\r\nbefore they had sufficient time to assume the gaseous condition, that\r\nthis dispersion was the main cause of the gaseous nebula coming to\r\noccupy so much space. And, to go farther back, it was the suddenness and\r\nalmost instantaneity with which the mass would receive the entire store\r\nof energy, before it had time to assume even the molten, not to say the\r\ngaseous, condition, which led to tremendous explosions, followed by a\r\nwide dispersion of materials.\r\n\r\n3. _Why nebulæ are of such varied shapes._—Although the dispersion of\r\nthe materials would be in all directions, it would, according to the law\r\nof probability, very rarely take place uniformly in every direction.\r\nThere would generally be a greater amount of dispersion in some\r\ndirections than in others, and the materials would thus be carried along\r\nvarious lines and to diverse distances; and, although gravity would tend\r\nto bring the widely scattered materials ultimately together into one or\r\nmore spherical masses, yet, owing to the exceedingly rarified condition\r\nof the gaseous mass, the nebulæ would change form but slowly.\r\n\r\n4. _Broken fragments in a gaseous mass of an excessively high\r\ntemperature the first stage of a nebula._—From what has already been\r\nshown, it will be seen that after the colliding of the two dark bodies\r\nthe first condition of the resulting nebula would be an enormous space\r\noccupied by broken fragments of all sizes dashing against each other\r\nwith tremendous velocities, like the molecules in a perfect gas. All the\r\ninterspaces between those fragments would be entirely filled with a\r\ngaseous mass, which, at its earliest stages at least, as in the case of\r\nthe solar nebula, would have a temperature probably more than one\r\nhundred thousand times that of the voltaic arc. Whether such a mass\r\nwould be visible is a point which can hardly be determined, as we can\r\nhave no experience on earth of a gas at such a temperature.\r\n\r\nThat there are some of the nebulæ which appear to consist of solid\r\nmatter interspersed in a gaseous mass is shown by the researches of Mr.\r\nLockyer[10] and others. In fact, the theory is held by Professor\r\nTait[11] that nebulæ consist of clouds of stones—or meteor-swarms, as\r\nMr. Lockyer would term them—in an atmosphere of hydrogen, each stone of\r\nwhich, moving about and coming into collision with some other, is\r\nthereby generating heat which renders the circumambient gas\r\nincandescent. In reference to this theory of Professor Tait, Mr. Lockyer\r\nsays that the phenomena of the spectroscope can be quite well explained\r\n“on the assumption of a cloud of stones, providing always that you could\r\nat the same time show reasonable cause why these clouds of stones were\r\n‘banging about’ in an atmosphere of hydrogen.”[12] The theory, however,\r\ndoes not appear to afford any rational explanation of this banging about\r\nof the stones to and fro in all directions; for, according to it, the\r\nonly force available is gravitation, and this can produce merely a\r\nmotion of the materials towards the centre of the mass. Under these\r\nconditions very little impinging of the stones against each other would\r\ntake place. But, according to the theory here adopted, we have an agency\r\nincalculably more effective than gravity, one which accounts not merely\r\nfor the impact of the stones, but for their very existence as such,\r\ninasmuch as it explains both what they are and whence they came.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Proceedings of Royal Society_, vol. xliii. p. 117.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Good Words_ for 1875, p. 861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Manchester Science Lectures._]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lockyer has recently fully adopted Professor Tait’s suggestion as to\r\nthe nature and origin of nebulæ, and has endeavoured to give it further\r\ndevelopment. He considers the nebulæ to be composed of sparse\r\nmeteorites, the collisions of which give the nebulæ their temperature\r\nand luminosity. He divides the nebulæ into three groups, “according as\r\nthe formative action seems working towards a centre; round a centre in a\r\nplane, or nearly so; or in one direction only.” As a result we have\r\nglobular, spheroidal, and cometic nebulæ.\r\n\r\n_Globular nebulæ_ he accounts for in the following manner. “If we,” he\r\nsays, “for the sake of the greatest simplicity consider a swarm of\r\nmeteorites at rest, and then assume that others from without approach it\r\nfrom all directions, their previous paths being deflected, the question\r\narises whether there will not be at some distance from the centre of the\r\nswarm a region in which collisions will be most valid. If we can answer\r\nthis question in the affirmative, it will follow that some of the\r\nmeteorites arrested here will begin to move in almost circular orbits\r\nround the common centre of gravity.\r\n\r\n“The major axes of these orbits may be assumed to be not very diverse,\r\nand we may further assume that, to begin with, one set will preponderate\r\nover the rest. Their elliptic paths may throw the periastron passage to\r\na considerable distance from the common centre of gravity; and if we\r\nassume that the meteorites with this common mean distance are moving in\r\nall planes, and that some are direct and some retrograde, there will be\r\na shell in which more collisions will take place than elsewhere. _Now,\r\nthis collision surface will be practically the only thing visible, and\r\nwill present to us the exact and hitherto unexplained appearance of a\r\nplanetary nebula—a body of the same intensity of luminosity at its edge\r\nand centre—thus putting on an almost phosphorescent appearance._\r\n\r\n“If the collision region has any great thickness, the centre should\r\nappear dimmer than the portion nearer the edge.\r\n\r\n“Such a collision surface, as I use the term, is presented to us during\r\na meteoric display by the upper part of our atmosphere.”[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Proc. of Royal Society_, vol. xliv. p. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spheroidal nebulæ_, he considers, are produced by the rotation of what\r\nwas at first a globular rotating swarm of meteorites.\r\n\r\n_Cometic nebulæ_ are explained, he considers, “on the supposition that\r\nwe have either a very condensed swarm moving at a very high velocity\r\nthrough a sheet of meteorites at rest, or the swarm at rest surrounded\r\nby a sheet, all moving in the same direction.”\r\n\r\nIn an able and interesting work, which seems almost utterly unknown in\r\nEngland,[14] Professor Winchell has advanced views similar to those of\r\nTait and Lockyer regarding the nature and origin of nebulæ. But he, in\r\naddition, discusses the further question of the origin of those swarms.\r\nI shall have occasion to refer to Professor Winchell’s views more fully\r\nwhen we come to the consideration of the pre-nebular condition of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _World Life, or Comparative Geology_, by Alexander\r\nWinchell, LL.D., Professor of Geology and Palæontology in the University\r\nof Michigan. Chicago: S. C. Griggs & Co. 1883.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the first to advance the meteoric hypothesis of the origin and\r\nformation of the solar system was probably the late Mr. Richard A.\r\nProctor. This was done in his work, “Other Worlds than Ours,” published\r\nin 1870. “Under the continual rain of meteoric matter,” he says, “it may\r\nbe said that the earth, sun, and planets are _growing_. Now, the idea\r\nobviously suggests itself that the whole growth of the solar system,\r\nfrom its primal condition to its present state, may have been due to\r\nprocesses resembling those which we now see taking place within its\r\nbounds.” He further adds: “It seems to me that not only has this general\r\nview of the mode in which our system has reached its present state a\r\ngreater support from what is now actually going on than the nebular\r\nhypothesis of Laplace, but that it serves to account in a far more\r\nsatisfactory manner for the principal peculiarities of the solar system.\r\nI might, indeed, go farther, and say that where those peculiarities seem\r\nto oppose themselves to Laplace’s theory they give support to those I\r\nhave put forward.”[15] He then goes on to show the points wherein his\r\ntheory seems to him to offer a better explanation of those peculiarities\r\nthan that of Laplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Other Worlds_, chap. ix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _The gaseous condition the second stage of a nebula._—The second\r\nstage obviously follows as a necessary consequence from the first; for\r\nthe fragments, in the case under consideration, possess energy in the\r\nform of motion, which, with the heat of their circumambient vapour, is\r\nmore than sufficient not only to convert the fragments into the gaseous\r\nstate, but to produce complete dissociation of the chemical elements.\r\nThe complete transformation of the first stage into the second must,\r\ntherefore, be simply a matter of time.\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of probability it may, however, sometimes happen\r\nthat the two original dark bodies will not collide with force sufficient\r\nto confer on the broken fragments the energy required to convert them\r\nall into the gaseous condition. The result in this case would, no doubt,\r\nbe that the untransformed fragments, drawn together by their mutual\r\nattractions, would collide and form an imperfect star or sun, without a\r\nplanet. Such a star might continue luminous for a few thousands or\r\nperhaps a few millions of years, as the case might be, when it would\r\nbegin to fade, and finally disappear. We have here an imperfect nebula,\r\nresulting in an imperfect star. In short, we should have in those\r\nstellar masses, on a grand scale, what we witness every day around us in\r\norganic nature, viz. imperfect formations. Such occasional imperfections\r\ngive variety and add perfection to the whole. How dreary and monotonous\r\nwould nature be, were every blade of grass, every plant, every animal,\r\nand every face we met formed after the most perfect model!\r\n\r\n6. _The gaseous condition essential to the nebular hypothesis._—It is\r\nfound that the density of the interior planets of our solar system\r\ncompared with that of the more remote is about as five to one. The\r\nobvious conclusion is that there is a preponderance of the metallic\r\nelements in the interior planets and of metalloids in the exterior. It\r\nthus becomes evident, as Mr. Lockyer has so clearly shown,[16] that when\r\nour solar system existed in a nebulous condition the metallic or denser\r\nelements would occupy the interior portion of the nebula and the\r\nmetalloids the exterior. Taking a section of this nebula from its centre\r\nto its circumference, the elements would in the main be found arranged\r\naccording to their densities: the densest at the centre, and the least\r\ndense at the circumference. If we compare the planets with their\r\nsatellites, we find the same law holding true. The satellites of\r\nJupiter, for example, have a density of about only one-fifth of that of\r\nthe planet, or about one twenty-fifth of that of our earth, showing that\r\nwhen the planet was rotating as a nebulous mass the more dense elements\r\nwere in the central parts and the less dense at the outer rim, where the\r\nsatellites were being formed. Again, if we take the case of our globe,\r\nwe find, as Mr. Lockyer remarks, the same distribution of materials,\r\nproving that when the earth was in the nebulous state the metallic\r\nelements chiefly occupied the central regions, and the metalloids those\r\nouter parts which now constitute the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Manchester Science Lectures._]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these facts show that the _sifting_ and _sorting_ of the chemical\r\nelements according to their densities must have taken place when our\r\nsolar system was in the condition of a nebula. But, further, it seems\r\nimpossible that this could have taken place had the materials composing\r\nthe nebula been in the solid form, even supposing that they had taken\r\nthe form of clouds of stones.\r\n\r\nIt is equally impossible that the nebula could have been in the fluid or\r\nliquid state during this process. This is obvious, for the nebula must\r\nthen have occupied, at least, the entire space within the orbit of the\r\nmost remote planet. But our solar system in the liquid condition could\r\nnot occupy one-millionth part of that space. It is therefore evident\r\nthat the nebula must have been in the state of a gas, and a gas of\r\nextreme tenuity.\r\n\r\n7. _The mass must have possessed an excessive temperature._—There is\r\nample evidence, Mr. Lockyer thinks, to show that the temperature of the\r\nsolar nebula was as great as that of the sun at the present time. But I\r\nthink it is extremely probable that, in some of its stages, the nebula\r\nhad a very much higher temperature than that now possessed by the sun.\r\nThere must, during the sifting period, have been complete chemical\r\ndissociation, so as to keep the metals and the metalloids uncombined,\r\nand thus allow the elements to arrange themselves according to their\r\ndensities. The nebula hypothesis, remarks Mr. Lockyer, “is almost\r\nworthless unless we assume very high temperatures, because, unless you\r\nhave heat enough to get perfect dissociation, you will not have that\r\nsorting out which always seems to follow the same law.”\r\n\r\n8. _Gravitation could, under no possible condition, have generated the\r\namount of heat required by the nebular hypothesis._—The nebular\r\nhypothesis does not profess to account for the origin of nebulæ. It\r\nstarts with matter existing in space in the nebulous condition, and\r\nexplains how, by condensation, suns, planets &c. are formed out of it.\r\nIn fact, it begins at the middle of a process: it begins with this fine,\r\nattenuated material in the process of being drawn together and condensed\r\nunder the influence of attraction, and professes to explain how, as the\r\nprocess goes on, a solar system necessarily results. To simplify our\r\ninquiry we shall confine our attention to the solar nebula, and consider\r\nin the first place how far condensation may be regarded as a sufficient\r\nsource of heat.\r\n\r\nA. _Condensation._—The heat which our nebula could have derived from\r\ncondensation up to the time that Neptune was detached from the mass, no\r\nmatter how far the outer circumference of the mass may have originally\r\nextended beyond the orbit of that planet, could not have amounted to\r\nover 1/7,000,000 of a thermal unit (772 foot-pounds) for each cubic\r\nfoot. It is perfectly obvious that this amount could not have produced\r\nthe dissociation required; and without the required dissociation Neptune\r\ncould never have been formed. Further, it is physically impossible that\r\nthe materials of which our solar system are composed could have existed\r\nin the gaseous state in a cool condition prior to condensation. Unless\r\npossessed of great heat, even hydrogen could not exist in stellar space\r\nin the gaseous form; and far less could carbon, iron, platinum, &c.\r\nBefore Neptune could have been formed the whole of the materials of the\r\nsystem must have possessed heat, not only sufficient to reduce them to\r\nthe gaseous state, but sufficient to produce complete dissociation. But\r\nby no conceivable means could gravitation have conferred this amount of\r\nheat by the time that the mass had condensed to just within the limits\r\nof the orbit of Neptune.\r\n\r\nB. _Solid globes colliding under the influence of gravity alone._—As we\r\nhave already seen, the view has been adopted by Sir W. Thomson that the\r\nsolar nebula may have resulted from the colliding of cold, solid globes\r\nwith the velocity due to their mutual gravitation alone. He states his\r\nviews as follows:\r\n\r\n“Suppose, now, that 29,000,000 cold, solid globes, each of about the\r\nsame mass as the moon, and amounting in all to a total mass equal to the\r\nsun’s, are scattered as uniformly as possible on a spherical surface of\r\nradius equal to one hundred times the radius of the earth’s orbit, and\r\nthat they are left absolutely at rest in that position. They will all\r\ncommence falling towards the centre of the sphere, and will meet there\r\nin 250 years, and every one of the 29,000,000 globes will then, in the\r\ncourse of half an hour, be melted, and raised to a temperature of a few\r\nhundred thousand or a million degrees Centigrade. The fluid mass thus\r\nformed will, by this prodigious heat, be exploded outwards in vapour or\r\ngas all round. Its boundary will reach to a distance considerably less\r\nthan one hundred times the radius of the earth’s orbit on first flying\r\nout to its extreme limit. A diminishing series of out-and-in\r\noscillations will follow, and the incandescent globe, thus contracting\r\nand expanding alternately, in the course, it may be, of 300 or 400\r\nyears, will settle to a radius of forty times the radius of the earth’s\r\norbit.”[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Proceedings of Royal Institution_, vol. xii. p. 16.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason which he assigns for the incandescent globe settling down at\r\na radius forty times that of the earth’s orbit is as follows: “The\r\nradius of a steady globular gaseous nebula of any homogeneous gas is 40\r\nper cent. of the radius of the spherical surface from which its\r\ningredients must fall to their actual positions in the nebula to have\r\nthe same kinetic energy as the nebula has.”\r\n\r\nIf the solar nebula thus produced would be swelled out into a spherical\r\nincandescent mass with a radius 40 times the radius of the earth’s\r\norbit, simply because the globes fell from a distance of 100 times the\r\nradius of that orbit, then for a similar reason the mass would have a\r\nradius of 400 times that of the earth’s orbit had the globes fallen from\r\na distance of 1,000 times the radius, and 400,000 times if the globes\r\nhad fallen from a distance of 1,000,000 times the radius, and two-fifths\r\nof any conceivable distance from which they may have fallen.\r\n\r\nSupposing all this to be _physically_ possible, which it undoubtedly is\r\nnot, still the heat generated would not be sufficient; for, whatever the\r\nradius of the nebula might be, its entire energy, both kinetic and\r\npotential, is simply what is obtained from gravitation, and this, as we\r\nhave seen, is insufficient.\r\n\r\n9. _Condensation the third and last condition of a nebula._—According to\r\nthe gravitation theory, condensation is the first stage of a nebula as\r\nwell as the last; for, according to it, gravity is the force which both\r\ncollects together the scattered materials and gives them their heat.[18]\r\nBefore condensation begins there can, according to the gravitation\r\ntheory, be no such thing as a nebula properly so called. The materials\r\nexist, of course, but they do not exist in the form of a nebula.\r\nAccording to the impact theory which I here advocate, condensation\r\ncannot begin till after the nebula has begun to lose the heat with which\r\nit was originally endowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Laplace held a more accurate view of the primitive\r\ncondition of the solar nebula. He considered that, owing to intense\r\nheat, the solar mass became expanded to the limits of the remotest\r\nplanetary orbit of our system; that, in cooling, it began slowly to\r\ncondense; and that, as condensation went on, planet after planet became\r\ndetached from the mass. Laplace, however, offered no explanation of the\r\nmanner in which the primitive nebula obtained its heat.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _How nebulæ emit such feeble light._—The light of nebulæ is mainly\r\nderived from glowing hydrogen and nitrogen in a condition of extreme\r\ngaseous tenuity; and it is well known that these gases are exceedingly\r\nbad radiators. The oxyhydrogen flame, although its temperature is\r\nsurpassed only by that of the voltaic arc, gives a light so feeble as to\r\nbe scarcely visible in daylight. The small luminosity of nebulæ is,\r\nhowever, mainly due to a different cause. The enormous space occupied by\r\nthose bodies is not so much due to the heat which they possess as to the\r\nfact that their materials were dispersed into space before they had time\r\nto pass into the gaseous condition; so that, by the time that this\r\nlatter state was assumed, the space occupied was far greater than was\r\ndemanded either by the temperature or by the amount of heat which they\r\noriginally received. If we adopt the nebular hypothesis of the origin of\r\nour solar system, we must assume that our sun’s mass, when in the\r\ncondition of a nebula, extended beyond the orbit of the planet Neptune,\r\nand consequently filled the entire space included within that orbit.\r\nEven supposing Neptune’s orbit to have been its outer limit, which,\r\nobviously, was not the case, it would nevertheless have occupied\r\n274,000,000,000 times the space it does at present. We shall assume, as\r\nbefore, that 50,000,000 years’ heat was generated by the concussion. Of\r\ncourse, there might have been twice or even ten times that quantity; but\r\nit is of no importance what amount is in the meantime adopted. Enormous\r\nas 50,000,000 years’ heat is, it yet gives, as we shall presently see,\r\nonly 32 foot-pounds of energy for each cubic foot. The amount of heat\r\ndue to concussion being equal, as before stated, to 100,000,000,000\r\nfoot-pounds for each pound of the mass, and a cubic foot of the sun at\r\nhis present density of 1·43 weighing 89 pounds, each cubic foot must\r\nhave possessed 8,900,000,000,000 foot-pounds. But when the mass was\r\nexpanded sufficiently to occupy 274,000,000,000 times its original space\r\n(which it would do when it extended to the orbit of Neptune), the heat\r\npossessed by each cubic foot would then amount to only 32 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact it would not even amount to so much, for a quantity\r\nequal to upwards of 20,000,000 years’ heat would necessarily be consumed\r\nin work against gravity in the expansion of the mass, all of which\r\nwould, of course, be given back in the form of heat as the mass\r\ncontracted. During the nebulous condition, however, this quantity would\r\nexist in an entirely different form, so that only 19 out of the 32\r\nfoot-pounds per cubic foot generated by concussion would then exist as\r\nheat. The density of the nebula would be only 1/16,248,160 that of\r\nhydrogen at ordinary temperature and pressure. The 19 foot-pounds of\r\nheat in each cubic foot would thus be sufficient to maintain an\r\nexcessive temperature; for there would be in each cubic foot only\r\n1/440,000 of a grain of matter. But, although the _temperature_ would be\r\nexcessive, the _quantity_ both of light and heat in each cubic foot\r\nwould of necessity be small. The heat being only 1/71 of a thermal unit,\r\nthe light emitted would certainly be exceedingly feeble, resembling very\r\nmuch the electric light in a vacuum-tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VI. _Binary Systems._\r\n\r\nThe theory affords a rational explanation of the origin of binary stars.\r\nBinary stars, in so far as regards their motion, follow also, of course,\r\nas a consequence, from the gravitation theory. If two bodies come into\r\ngrazing collision, “they will,” says Sir William Thomson, “commence\r\nrevolving round their common centre of inertia in long elliptic orbits.\r\nTidal interaction between them will diminish the eccentricities of their\r\norbits, and, if continued long enough, will cause them to revolve in\r\ncircular orbits round their centre of inertia.”[19] This conclusion was\r\npointed out many years ago by Dr. Johnstone Stoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Proceedings of Royal Institution_, vol. xii. p. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   VII. _Sudden Outbursts of Stars._\r\n\r\nThe case of a star suddenly blazing forth and then fading away, such as\r\nthat observed by Tycho Brahe in 1572, may be accounted for by supposing\r\nthat the star had been struck by one of the dark bodies—an event not at\r\nall impossible, or even improbable. In some cases of sudden outbursts,\r\nsuch as that of Nova Cygni, for example, the phenomenon may result from\r\nthe star encountering a swarm of meteorites. The difficulty in the case\r\nof Nova Cygni is to account for the very sudden decline of its\r\nbrilliancy. This might, however, be explained by supposing that the\r\noutburst of luminosity was due to the destruction of the meteorites, and\r\nnot to any great increase of heat produced in the star itself. A swarm\r\nof meteorites converted into incandescent vapour would not be long in\r\nlosing its brilliancy.\r\n\r\nMr. Lockyer thinks that the outburst was produced by the collision of\r\ntwo swarms of meteorites, and not by the collision of the meteorites\r\nwith a previously existing star.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, vol. xliii. p. 140.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the millions of stars occupying stellar space catastrophes of\r\nthis sort may, according to the theory, be expected sometimes to happen,\r\nalthough, like the collisions which originate stars themselves, they\r\nmust, doubtless, be events of but rare occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VIII. _Star Clusters._\r\n\r\nA star cluster will result from an immensely widespread nebula breaking\r\nup into a host of separate nuclei, each of which becomes a star. The\r\nirregular manner in which the materials would, in many cases, be widely\r\ndistributed through space after collision would prevent a nebula from\r\ncondensing into a single mass. Subordinate centres of attraction would\r\nbe established, as was long ago shown by Sir William Herschel in his\r\nfamous memoir on the formation of stars;[21] and around these the\r\ngaseous particles would arrange themselves and gradually condense into\r\nseparate stars, which would finally assume the condition of a cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1811.]\r\n\r\n\r\n              IX. _Age of the Sun’s Heat: a Crucial Test._\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the question of the age of the sun’s heat, and the\r\nlength of time during which that orb has illuminated our globe, it\r\nbecomes a matter of the utmost importance which of the two theories is\r\nto be adopted. On the age of the sun’s heat rests the whole question of\r\ngeological time. A mistake here is fundamental. If gravitation be the\r\nonly source from which the sun derived its heat, then life on the globe\r\ncannot possibly date farther back than 20,000,000 years; for under no\r\npossible form could gravitation have afforded, at the present rate of\r\nradiation, sufficient heat for a longer period. It will not do to state\r\nin a loose and general way, as has been frequently done, that the sun\r\nmay have been supplying our globe with heat at its present rate for\r\n20,000,000 or 100,000,000 years, for gravitation could have done no such\r\nthing; a period of 20,000,000, not 100,000,000, years is the lowest\r\nwhich is admissible on that theory. Not even that length of time would\r\nbe actually available; for this period is founded on Pouillet’s estimate\r\nof the rate of solar radiation, which has been proved by Langley to be\r\ntoo small, the correct rate being 1·7 times greater. “Thus,” as says Sir\r\nW. Thomson, “instead of Helmholtz’s 20,000,000 years, we have only\r\n12,000,000.” But the 12,000,000 years would not in reality be available\r\nfor plant and animal life; for undoubtedly millions of years would\r\nelapse before our globe could become adapted for either flora or fauna.\r\nIf there is no other source of heat for our system than gravitation, it\r\nis doubtful if we can calculate on much more than half that period for\r\nthe age of life on the earth. Professor Tait probably over-estimates the\r\ntime when he affirms “that 10,000,000 years is about the utmost that can\r\nbe allowed, from the physical point of view, for all the changes that\r\nhave taken place on the earth’s surface since vegetable life of the\r\nlowest known form was capable of existing there.”[22] And this is\r\ncertainly about all that can ever be expected from gravitation;\r\nmathematical computation has demonstrated that it can give no more. The\r\nother theory, founded on motion in space—a cause as real as\r\ngravitation—labours under no such limitation. According to it, so far at\r\nleast as regards the store of energy which may have been possessed by\r\nthe sun, plant and animal life may date back, not to 10,000,000 years,\r\nbut to a period indefinitely more remote. In fact, there is as yet no\r\nknown limit to the amount of heat which this cause may have produced;\r\nfor this depended upon the velocities of the two bodies at the moment\r\nprior to collision, and what these velocities were we have no means of\r\nknowing. They might have been 500 miles a second, or 5,000 miles a\r\nsecond, for anything which can be shown to the contrary. Of course I by\r\nno means affirm that it is as much as 100,000,000 years since life began\r\non our earth; but I certainly do affirm that, in so far as a possible\r\nsource of the sun’s energy is concerned, life may have begun at a period\r\nas remote.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Recent Advances in Physical Sciences_, p. 175.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II.\r\n\r\n  _EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE THEORY FROM THE AGE OF THE SUN’S HEAT._\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF GEOLOGY AND BIOLOGY AS TO THE AGE OF THE SUN’S HEAT.\r\n\r\nThe question which we have now to consider is—to which of the two\r\ntheories does geology lend its testimony? Will the length of time which,\r\naccording to the gravitation theory, can possibly be allotted satisfy\r\nthe requirements of geology? In short, are the facts of geology\r\nreconcilable with the theory? If not, the theory must be abandoned.\r\n\r\nBefore the period when geologists felt that they were limited to time by\r\nphysical considerations, the most extravagant opinions prevailed in\r\nregard to the length of geological epochs. So long as the physicist\r\ncontinued to state in a loose and general way that the sun might have\r\nbeen supplying our earth with heat at his present rate for the past\r\n100,000,000 years, no very serious difficulty was felt; but when\r\ngeologists came to understand that ten or twenty millions of years were\r\nall that could be granted to them, the condition of matters was entirely\r\naltered. The belief that the mathematical physicist must be right in his\r\nviews as to the age of the sun’s heat, and that there is no possibility\r\nof a longer period being admitted, seems at present to be leading\r\ngeologists towards the opposite extreme in regard to the length of\r\ngeological time. Attempts have been recently made to compress the\r\ngeological history of our globe into the narrow space allotted by the\r\nphysicist. The attempt is hopeless, as well as injurious to geological\r\nscience. What misleads is not the belief that gravitation could not\r\npossibly afford a supply of heat sufficient for more than 20,000,000\r\nyears, for this is true; it is the belief that there was no other source\r\nof heat than gravity.\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the evidence which geology seems to afford as to\r\nthe age of the sun’s heat. Geology is quite competent to render aid on\r\nthis point, for the sun’s heat must be at least as old as life on this\r\nglobe; and the record of the rocks tells us when this life first\r\nappeared. We require, however, to be able to measure the time which has\r\nelapsed since these records were left. What we want is absolute time;\r\nnot relative time. Much has been done by geologists in regard to\r\nrelative time; but this can be of no service to us in our present\r\ninquiry. Unfortunately very little trustworthy work has been done in the\r\nway of determining the absolute length of geological periods. Happily,\r\nhowever, great exactness of measure is not required. A rough\r\napproximation to the truth will suffice for our present purpose. If it\r\ncan be shown to be more than fifteen or twenty millions of years since\r\nlife first appeared on the earth, it will as effectually prove that\r\ngravitation alone could not have been the source from which the sun\r\nderived his heat as if it were shown that that period was a thousand\r\ntimes more remote. All we have to do is simply to assign an _inferior\r\nlimit_ to the age of life on the earth; and this can be effectually done\r\nby means of the methods, imperfect though they be, which we have at\r\ncommand. As the question of geological time is of some importance in\r\nrelation to our present inquiry, I shall consider it at some length.\r\n\r\n_Testimony of Geology: method employed._—What has subsequently proved to\r\nbe a pretty successful method of measuring geological time suggested\r\nitself to my mind during the summer of 1865. It then occurred to me that\r\nwe might obtain a tolerably accurate measure of absolute geological time\r\nfrom the present rate of subaërial denudation, which might be\r\nascertained in the following way: The rate of subaërial denudation must\r\nbe equal to the rate at which materials are carried off the land into\r\nthe sea; and this is measured by the rate at which sediment is carried\r\ndown by our river systems. _Consequently, in order to determine the\r\npresent rate of subaërial denudation, we have only to ascertain the\r\nquantity of sediment annually carried down by the river systems._ This\r\ngives us the time required to remove any given quantity, say one foot,\r\noff the face of the country. If we assume the rate to be pretty much the\r\nsame during past geological ages, we have a means of telling the time\r\nthat was occupied in removing any known thickness of strata. But as we\r\nnever can be perfectly certain that the rate is the same in both cases,\r\nthe results can, of course, be regarded as only approximately true.\r\n\r\nTaking the quantity of sediment discharged into the sea annually by the\r\nMississippi river, as determined by Messrs. Brown and Dickson,[23] I\r\nfound that it amounted to one foot off the face of the country in 1,388\r\nyears, and that, at this rate of denudation, our continents, even if\r\nthey had an elevation of 1,000 feet, would not remain above sea-level\r\nover 1,500,000 years.[24] This was an exaggerated estimate of the\r\nquantity of sediment, for I shortly afterwards found that far more\r\naccurate determinations were made by Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot,[25]\r\nwho were employed by the United States Government to report upon the\r\nphysics and hydraulics of the Mississippi. Messrs. Brown and Dickson had\r\nestimated the quantity of sediment at 28,188,083,892 cubic feet, whereas\r\nMessrs. Humphreys and Abbot found it to be only 6,724,000,000 cubic\r\nfeet, or less than one-fourth that amount. This gives one foot in 6,000\r\nyears as the rate of denudation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Proceedings of the American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science_ for 1848.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Philosophical Magazine_, February 1867. I was not aware\r\nat this time that Mr. Alfred Tylor had previously applied the same\r\nmethod to determine an entirely different point, viz.: how much the\r\nsea-level is being raised by the sediment deposited on the sea-bottom.\r\nMr. Tylor’s paper, entitled “On Changes of the Sea-Level effected by\r\nexisting Physical Causes during stated Periods of Time,” appeared in the\r\n_Phil. Mag._ for April 1853. Mr. Tylor came to the conclusion that the\r\nsea-level was being raised, from this cause, about 3 inches in 10,000\r\nyears.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Report upon the Physics and Hydraulics of the\r\nMississippi._]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Dr. Archibald Geikie took up the question and went into the\r\nconsideration of the subject in a most thorough manner; and it is mainly\r\nthrough the instrumentality of his writings on the matter[26] that the\r\nmethod under consideration has gained such wide-spread acceptance among\r\ngeologists. After an examination of nearly all that is known regarding\r\nthe amount of sediment carried down by rivers, he drew up the following\r\ntable, showing the number of years required by seven rivers to remove\r\none foot of rock from the general surface of their basins.\r\n\r\n                      Danube           6,846 years\r\n                      Mississippi      6,000   „\r\n                      Nith             4,723   „\r\n                      Ganges           2,358   „\r\n                      Rhone            1,528   „\r\n                      Hoang-Ho         1,464   „\r\n                      Po                 729   „\r\n                                       ----- -----\r\n                                  Mean 3,378 years\r\n\r\nThis gives a mean of 3,378 years to remove one foot, or a little over\r\none-half the time taken by the Mississippi. This mean appears to be\r\ngenerally taken as representing the average rate of subaërial denudation\r\nof the whole earth, but it has, I fear, been rather too hastily adopted.\r\nTo estimate correctly the quantity of sediment annually discharged by a\r\nlarge river is a most difficult and laborious undertaking. A perusal of\r\nthe voluminous report of Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot, extending over 690\r\npages, which Dr. Geikie justly styles a model of patient and exhaustive\r\nresearch, will clearly show this, and at the same time prove how\r\nskilfully and accurately the task allotted to them was performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Trans. of Geol. Soc. of Glasgow_, vol. iii.; Jukes &\r\nGeikie’s _Manual of Geology_, chap. xxv.; _Text Book of Geology_, p.\r\n441.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe risk of making very serious errors in computing the amount of\r\nsediment discharged, unless proper precautions are taken, is well\r\nillustrated in the case of the determinations made by Messrs. Brown and\r\nDickson, to which reference has already been made. Although their report\r\nshows that they took great pains in order to arrive at correct\r\nresults—in fact, they computed the total annual quantity of sediment\r\ndischarged to within a cubic foot—after all, instead of being correct to\r\nthis minute quantity, they gave a total more than fourfold what it ought\r\nto be. A somewhat similar discrepancy exists in reference to the\r\ndenudation of the basin of the Ganges. The time required to lower its\r\nsurface by one foot is, according to one estimate, 2,358 years;\r\naccording to another, 1,751; and according to a third, only 1,146 years.\r\nThe first figure is probably nearest the truth. Still, these differences\r\nshow both the difficulty of the problem and the necessity of caution in\r\nadopting any of these results as correct.\r\n\r\nBy far the most trustworthy determinations of the whole are those of the\r\nMississippi by Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot, which may be relied upon as\r\nnot far from the truth. But, supposing the estimates in the foregoing\r\ntable to be perfectly correct, can we assume that their mean may be\r\nsafely taken as probably representing the average rate of denudation of\r\nthe whole earth? I would most unhesitatingly reply, Certainly not. The\r\nRhone and Po are full of glacier mud from the Alps; and the amount of\r\nsediment which they carry down may give us the rate of denudation of\r\nSwitzerland, but certainly not that of the whole earth, or even of\r\nEurope. The same may be said of the Ganges, which is charged with the\r\nmud which it brings down from the Himalaya Mountains. The Hoang-Ho, or\r\nYellow River, is an exceptionally muddy river; in fact, it derives its\r\nname from the vast quantity of yellow mud held by its waters in a state\r\nof solution. It was probably the exceptionally muddy character of the\r\nPo, the Rhone, the Ganges, and the Yellow River which attracted\r\nattention, and led to observations being made of the sediment they\r\ncontain. Rivers more unsuitable than these to give us the average\r\ndenudation of the earth’s surface could not well be selected. Among the\r\nseven rivers in the table, leaving out of account the small Scottish\r\nstream, the Nith, with its basin of only 200 square miles, there are\r\nonly two, the Mississippi and the Danube, that drain countries which may\r\nbe regarded as in every way resembling the average condition of the\r\nearth’s surface. I would choose the Mississippi as being superior to the\r\nDanube, for two reasons: (1) because the rate of denudation of its basin\r\nhas been more accurately determined; and (2) because the area of its\r\nbasin not only exceeds that of the Danube as five to one, but better\r\nfulfils the necessary conditions, as Sir Charles Lyell has so clearly\r\nshown. “That river,” says Sir Charles, “drains a country equal to more\r\nthan half the continent of Europe, extends through twenty degrees of\r\nlatitude, and therefore through regions enjoying a great variety of\r\nclimate, and some of its tributaries descend from mountains of great\r\nheight. The Mississippi is also more likely to afford us a fair test of\r\nordinary denudation, because, unlike the St. Lawrence and its\r\ntributaries, there are no great lakes in which the fluviatile sediment\r\nis thrown down and arrested on its way to the sea.”[27] There is no\r\nother river in the globe which to my mind better fulfils the required\r\nconditions. It is no doubt true that the rate of denudation of the basin\r\nof the Mississippi is probably less than that of Switzerland, Norway,\r\nand the Himalayas, where glaciers abound, and certainly less than that\r\nof Greenland and the Antarctic continent; but, on the other hand, this\r\nrate is certainly much greater than that of the whole continent of\r\nAfrica, Australia, and large tracts of Asia, where the rainfall is much\r\nsmaller. One foot in 6,000 years may, therefore, I think, be safely\r\ntaken as the average rate of denudation of the whole surface of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Student’s Elements of Geology_, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The average rate of denudation in the past probably not much greater\r\nthan in the present._—The belief has long prevailed that the rate of\r\ndenudation was much greater in past ages than it is now; but I am unable\r\nto perceive any good grounds for concluding that such was the case at\r\nany time since the beginning of the Palæozoic period. Various reasons\r\nhave, however, been assigned for this supposed greater rate; and to the\r\nconsideration of these I shall now very briefly refer.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that at some remote epoch of the earth’s history,\r\nwhen the moon was much nearer and the day much shorter than now, the\r\nrate of denudation would, owing to the erosive power of the enormous\r\ntides which would then prevail, be much greater than at the present day.\r\nThis, however, is very doubtful. There is nothing in the stratified\r\nrocks which affords any support to the idea of great tidal waves having\r\nswept over the land, at least since the time when life began on our\r\nglobe. Such a state of things would have destroyed all animal life. “The\r\nPalæozoic sediments,” as Professor A. Winchell remarks, “have been\r\ndeposited, for the chief part, in quiet seas. The deep beds of\r\nlimestones and shales are spread out in sheets continent-wide, which\r\ntestify unmistakably to placid waters and slow deposition.”[28] But high\r\ntides, not sweeping over the land, would not increase the rate of\r\ndenudation to the extent supposed. High tides silt up a river channel\r\nmore readily than they deepen it. A higher tide would probably produce a\r\ngreater destruction of sea-coast: it would tend to increase the rate of\r\nmarine denudation, but this would not materially affect the general rate\r\nof denudation. For, as the present rate of marine denudation is to that\r\nof subaërial denudation only as 1 to about 1,700,[29] it would take a\r\nvery large increase in the rate of marine denudation to affect sensibly\r\nthe general result. Suppose the rate of marine denudation to have been,\r\nfor example, ten times as great during the Palæozoic age as it is now\r\n(which it certainly was not), it would only have shortened the time\r\nrequired to effect a given amount of denudation of the whole earth by 9\r\nyears in 1,700, i.e. by little more than one-half per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _World Life_, p. 265.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See _Climate and Time_, p. 337.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, it is assumed that the greater rate of terrestrial rotation in\r\nthe early ages would produce certain influences which would in turn\r\nbring about a greater amount of denudation. The rate of rotation has\r\nbeen slowly decreasing for ages, and in Palæozoic times it must, of\r\ncourse, have been greater than at present. A more rapid rotation would\r\nincrease the velocity of the trade and anti-trade winds, and would thus\r\ntend to augment the action of those meteorological agents chiefly\r\neffective in the work of subaërial denudation. Here again the testimony\r\nof geology is negative. We have no geological grounds to conclude that\r\nthe winds of Palæozoic times were stronger than those at the present\r\nday. The heat was no doubt greater, and perhaps there was more rain;\r\nbut, on the other hand, there would be less frost, snow, ice, and other\r\ndenuding agents.\r\n\r\nThere is one cause which would, perhaps, be more effective than any of\r\nthe foregoing: viz. the periodic occurrence of glacial epochs. When a\r\ncountry is buried under ice, the erosion of the surface is great. But it\r\nmust be borne in mind that the influence of rain, rivers, and other\r\ndenuding agents now in operation would then, in the glaciated regions,\r\nbe almost _nil_. Besides, the greater part of the materials ground off\r\nthe rocks would be left on the land; and, when the ice disappeared, it\r\nwould be found in the form of a thick mantle of boulder clay—a mantle\r\nwhich would protect the rocky surface of the country for thousands and\r\ntens of thousands of years from further denudation. This is shown by the\r\nfine striæ on the rocky surface, made perhaps more than 50,000 years\r\nago, remaining under the boulder clay as perfect as the day on which\r\nthey were engraved. But, more than all this, a very considerable part of\r\nthe 1 foot presently being removed off the country in 6,000 years\r\nconsists of the loose materials belonging to the glacial epoch, such as\r\nsands, gravels, and boulder clay, which are being swept off the surface\r\nby rain and river action. Were it not for this, the present rate of\r\nsubaërial denudation would not be so high as it actually is. Taking all\r\nthings into consideration, it is, I think, obvious that the average rate\r\nof denudation since the beginning of Palæozoic times was probably not\r\nmuch greater than at the present day.\r\n\r\n_How the method has been applied._—Having determined what appears to be\r\nthe probable average rate of subaërial denudation, we may now proceed to\r\nconsider the way in which this rate has been applied to measure past\r\ngeological time. There are two ways in which it may be applied for this\r\npurpose. It may (1) be applied directly: knowing the thickness of strata\r\nwhich may have been removed by denudation, we can easily tell, from that\r\nrate, the time it required to effect their removal. If we have evidence,\r\nfor example, that at some epoch 1,000 feet of stratified rock were\r\ncarried away, then, on the assumption that the rate of denudation was\r\nthe same at that epoch as now, we have 1,000 × 6,000 = 6,000,000 years\r\nas the required time. (2) It may be applied indirectly: knowing the\r\nthickness of the strata, we may estimate the time required for their\r\nformation. This is the way in which it has usually been applied, but, as\r\nwe shall see, it is the less satisfactory way of the two.\r\n\r\nDr. A. Geikie gives the land area of the globe as 52,000,000 square\r\nmiles, and that of water as 144,712,000 square miles.[30] We may thus\r\ntake the proportion of land to water roughly as 1 to 3; about\r\none-quarter of the earth’s surface being land, and three-quarters water.\r\nOne foot, therefore, removed off the surface of the land would cover the\r\nwhole globe with a layer 3 inches thick, or the entire sea-bottom with a\r\nlayer 4 inches thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Physical Geography_, p. 103.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we knew the total quantity of stratified rock on the globe, we could\r\neasily tell the time that would be required for its formation. Most\r\ngeologists would, I believe, be inclined to admit that, if spread\r\nuniformly over the entire globe, it would form a layer of at least 1,000\r\nfeet in thickness. In such a case the time required for its deposition\r\nwould be as follows:\r\n\r\n                 1,000 × 6,000 × 4 = 24,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nThis would not, however, represent the age of the stratified rocks. It\r\nwould only represent the time required to deposit the rocks which we\r\nhave assumed to be now in existence. The greater mass of sedimentary\r\nrocks has been formed out of previously existing sedimentary rocks, and\r\nthese again out of sedimentary rocks still older. The oldest known\r\nsedimentary rocks are the Laurentian; but these are believed by\r\ngeologists to have been formed from still older sedimentary rocks. It is\r\ntherefore evident that the materials composing our stratified beds must\r\nhave passed through many cycles of destruction and re-formation. The\r\nmaterials of some of the recent formations, for example, may have passed\r\nthrough denudation and deposition a dozen of times over.[31] The time\r\nrequired to have deposited at a given rate the present existing mass of\r\nsedimentary rocks is probably but a small fraction of the time required\r\nto have deposited at the same rate the total mass that has actually been\r\nformed. Few geologists, I think, who will duly reflect on the subject,\r\nwill deem it too much to say that the present existing stratified rocks\r\nhave on an average passed at least thrice through the cycle of\r\ndestruction and re-formation. If this be admitted, then the 1,000 feet\r\nof stratified rock represent, not a period of 24,000,000 years, but a\r\nperiod three times as great, viz. 72,000,000 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: It is this destruction of the stratified rocks which makes\r\nit so difficult to detect the marks of former glacial epochs, and which\r\nhas led to such prevailing misconceptions regarding the evidence which\r\nwe ought to expect of those epochs. See paper read before the Geological\r\nSociety, “On Prevailing Misconceptions regarding the Evidence which we\r\nought to expect of former Glacial Periods,” January 23, 1889.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to tell from geological data the actual age of the\r\nstratified rocks; but this is not required. What we require is, as\r\nalready stated, not their _actual_ age, but an _inferior limit_ to that\r\nage.\r\n\r\n_Method as applied by Professor Haughton._—Professor Haughton estimates\r\nthe mass of the stratified rocks down to the time of the Miocene\r\nTertiary period as being 177,200 feet in thickness, and covering an area\r\nequal to that of the sea. The present rate of subaërial denudation he\r\nconsiders to be equal to one foot removed off the surface of the land in\r\n3,090 years. If the proportion of land to water be taken as 52 to 145,\r\nit thus requires 8,616 years to deposit one foot of sediment over the\r\nbed of the ocean, and consequently this is the rate at which strata are\r\nat present being formed. This would give 8,616 × 177,200 = 1,526,750,000\r\nyears for the age of the stratified rocks. But he assumes the rate of\r\ndenudation to have been _ten times_ greater in geological time than at\r\npresent. This consequently reduces the age of the rocks to 152,675,000\r\nyears. By adding one-third for the time which has elapsed since the\r\nMiocene Tertiary period he gets 200,000,000 years as a minimum length of\r\ngeological time.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Physical Geography_, p. 94.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe validity of this result rests upon what appear to me to be two very\r\ndoubtful assumptions. It is assumed in his calculations that the total\r\namount of strata formed during past ages (not the amount presently\r\nremaining) was equal to a mass 177,200 feet in thickness, covering the\r\nentire area of the ocean. This is certainly doubtful. It may have been\r\nas great, for anything that can be proved to the contrary; but we have\r\nno evidence that it was so. Certainly there is no evidence that the rate\r\nof subaërial denudation during past ages was ever ten times as great as\r\nit is now. But how is a length of 200,000,000 years to be reconciled\r\nwith the age of the sun’s heat? The stratified rocks may be as old as\r\nthis, but assuredly they are not if gravitation was the only source from\r\nwhich the sun derived his energy.\r\n\r\n_Method as applied by Mr. Alfred R. Wallace._—Mr. Wallace adopts\r\nProfessor Haughton’s estimate of 177,200 feet for the maximum thickness\r\nof the sedimentary rocks. But, instead of supposing, like Professor\r\nHaughton, the products of denudation to be uniformly spread over the\r\nentire sea-bottom, he supposes them spread over a belt of merely 30\r\nmiles broad, extending along the entire coast-line of the globe, which\r\nhe estimates at 100,000 miles. This gives an area of 3,000,000 square\r\nmiles on which the denuded matter of the whole land area of 57,000,000\r\nsquare miles is deposited. These two areas are to one another as 1 to\r\n19, and thus it follows that deposition goes on 19 times as fast as\r\ndenudation. The rate of denudation he takes as one foot removed off the\r\nsurface of the land in 3,000 years, so that the rate of deposition would\r\nbe about one foot in 158 years, and consequently the time required to\r\ndeposit the 177,200 feet of rock would be\r\n\r\n                   177,200 × 158 = 27,997,600 years.\r\n\r\nThis is a period double what the gravitation theory of the source of the\r\nsun’s energy can afford. And if the rate of denudation be taken at one\r\nfoot in 6,000 years, which is, as we have seen, probably nearer the\r\ntruth, then this would make the age of the stratified rocks 56,000,000\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a little ambiguity about Mr. Wallace’s result. Do the\r\n177,200 feet represent the quantity of rock which presently exists, or\r\ndo they represent the total quantity which has been formed during all\r\npast ages? If the former, then the 28,000,000 years are but a fraction\r\nof the time which must have been required; for, as we have been shown,\r\nthe materials composing the stratified rocks have, on an average, been\r\ndeposited at least three or four times over. If, on the other hand, the\r\nthickness is meant to represent the total quantity of rock which has\r\nbeen formed during the whole of past geological time, then the question\r\narises, by what means could this quantity possibly be ascertained? In\r\nother words, how was the relation between the present quantity and the\r\ntotal quantity ascertained? But in either case the result is wholly\r\nirreconcilable with the gravitation theory of the source of the sun’s\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n_Method as applied directly._—We have seen that it is impossible to\r\ndetermine the actual age of the earth from the stratified rocks, even if\r\nwe knew with perfect accuracy their present total amount. We have also\r\nseen that from the rate of deposition we cannot fix with any degree of\r\ncertainty a minimum value for the age of these rocks. We can, however,\r\nby means of the first or direct application of the method, assign with\r\ntolerable accuracy, as was shown on a former occasion,[33] a minimum age\r\nto the earth. We can be far more certain of the time which must have\r\nbeen required to remove by denudation, say, a thousand feet of rock than\r\nwe can possibly be of the time required to have deposited a thousand\r\nfeet of sediment. The thousand feet of sediment may, under certain\r\nconditions, have been deposited in a hundred years, while under other\r\nconditions they may have required a million of years. In fact, nothing\r\ncan be more uncertain than the rate of deposition: it depends upon such\r\na multitude of circumstances. At the mouth of a great river, for\r\nexample, a foot of sediment may be deposited in a single day, whereas in\r\nsome places, as in mid-ocean, it may require a million of years to\r\ndeposit the same amount. But in reference to subaërial denudation no\r\nsuch uncertainty exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Quart. Journ. of Science_, July 1877; _Climate and\r\nCosmology_, chap. xvii.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utter inadequacy of a period of 20,000,000 years for the age of our\r\nearth is demonstrable from the enormous thickness of rock which is known\r\nto have been removed off certain areas by denudation. I shall now\r\nbriefly refer to a few of the many facts which might be adduced on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n_Evidence from “faults.”_—One plain and obvious method of showing the\r\ngreat extent to which the general surface of the country has been\r\nlowered by denudation is furnished, as is well known, by the way in\r\nwhich the inequalities of surface produced by faults or dislocations\r\nhave been effaced. It is quite common to meet with faults where the\r\nstrata on the one side have been depressed several hundreds—and in some\r\ncases thousands—of feet below those on the other; but we seldom find any\r\nindications of such on the surface, the inequalities on the surface\r\nhaving been all removed by denudation. Now, in order to effect this, a\r\nmass of rock must have been removed equal in thickness to the extent of\r\nthe dislocation. The following are a few examples of large faults:\r\n\r\nThe great Irwell fault, described by Professor Hull,[34] which stretches\r\nfrom the Mersey west of Stockport to the north of Bolton, has a throw of\r\nupwards of 3,000 feet.\r\n\r\nSome remarkable faults have been found by Professor Ramsay in North\r\nWales. For example, near Snowdon, and about a mile E.S.E. of Beddgelert,\r\nthere is a fault with a downthrow of 5,000 feet; and in the Berwyn\r\nHills, between Bryn-mawr and Post-gwyn, there is one of 5,000 feet. In\r\nthe Aran Range there is a great fault, designated the Bala fault, with a\r\ndownthrow of 7,000 feet. Again, between Aran Mowddwy and Careg Aderyn\r\nthe displacement of the strata amounts to no less than from 10,000 to\r\n11,000 feet.[35] Here we have evidence that a mass of rock, varying from\r\none to two miles in vertical thickness, must have been denuded in many\r\nplaces from the surface of the country in North Wales.\r\n\r\nThe fault which passes along the east side of the Pentlands is estimated\r\nto have a throw of upwards of 3,000 feet.[36] Along the flank of the\r\nGrampians a great fault runs from the North Sea at Stonehaven to the\r\nestuary of the Clyde, throwing the Old Red Sandstone on end sometimes\r\nfor a distance of two miles from the line of dislocation. The amount of\r\nthe displacement, Dr. A. Geikie[37] concludes, must in some places be\r\nnot less than 5,000 feet, as indicated by the position of occasional\r\noutliers of conglomerate on the Highland side of the fault.\r\n\r\nThe great fault crossing Scotland from near Dunbar to the Ayrshire\r\ncoast, which separates the Silurians of the South of Scotland from the\r\nOld Red Sandstone and Carboniferous tracts of the North, has been found\r\nby Mr. B. N. Peach, of the Geological Survey,[38] to have in some places\r\na throw of fully 15,000 feet. This great dislocation is older than the\r\nCarboniferous period, as is shown by the entire absence of any Old Red\r\nSandstone on the south side of the fault, and by the occurrence of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone and Coal-measures lying directly on the Silurian\r\nrocks. We obtain here some idea of the enormous amount of denudation\r\nwhich must have taken place during a comparatively limited geological\r\nepoch. So vast a thickness of Old Red Sandstone could not, as Mr. Peach\r\nremarks, “have ended originally where the fault now is, but must have\r\nswept southwards over the Lower Silurian uplands. Yet these thousands of\r\nfeet of sandstones, conglomerates, lavas, and tuffs were so completely\r\nremoved from the south side of the fault previous to the deposition of\r\nthe Carboniferous Limestone series and the Coal-measures, that not a\r\nfragment of them is anywhere to be seen between these latter formations\r\nand the old Silurian floor.”[39] This enormous thickness of nearly three\r\nmiles of Old Red Sandstone must have been carried away during the period\r\nwhich intervened between the deposition of the lower members of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone and the accumulation of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone.\r\n\r\nNear Tipperary, in the south of Ireland, there is a dislocation of the\r\nstrata of not less than 4,000 feet,[40] which brings down the\r\nCoal-measures against the Silurian rocks. Here 1,000 feet of Old Red\r\nSandstone, 3,000 feet of Carboniferous Limestone, and 800 feet of\r\nCoal-measures have been removed by denudation off the Silurian rocks.\r\nNot only has this immense thickness of beds been carried away, but the\r\nSilurian itself on which they rested has been eaten down in some places\r\ninto deep valleys several hundreds of feet below the surface on which\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone rested.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Mem. Geol. Survey of Lancashire_, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Mem. Geol. Survey of Great Britain_, vol. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Memoir_ to Sheet 32, Geol. Survey Map of Scotland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Nature_, vol. xiii. p. 390.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Explanation_ to Sheet 15, Geol. Survey Map of Scotland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: I have been informed by Mr. Peach that since the above was\r\nwritten additional light has been cast on this immense fault. It has\r\nbeen found, he says, that the fault consists of two sub-parallel\r\nbranches, the more southerly of which has the effect of bringing the\r\nrocks of the Upper Silurian age against the Lower Silurian beds. The\r\nnorthern branch brings the upper division of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstones, in turn, against the Upper Silurian rocks. This, Mr. Peach\r\nremarks, does not in the least invalidate the reasoning as to the amount\r\nof material removed by denudation from this region in the time\r\nspecified. In fact, it shows, he says, that a greater amount must have\r\nbeen removed than was at first suspected.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Jukes’s and Geikie’s _Manual of Geology_, p. 441.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning to the American continent, we find the amount of rock removed to\r\nbe even still greater. In the Valley of Thessolon, to the north of Lake\r\nHuron, there is a dislocation of the strata to the extent of 9,000\r\nfeet.[41]\r\n\r\nIn front of the Chilowee Mountains there is a vertical displacement of\r\nthe strata of more than 10,000 feet.[42] Professor H. D. Rogers found in\r\nthe Appalachian coal-fields faults ranging from 5,000 feet to more than\r\n10,000 feet of displacement.\r\n\r\nIn the Nova Scotia coal-fields one or two miles in thickness of strata\r\nhave been removed in some places.[43]\r\n\r\nA great fracture runs along the axis of the Sierra Nevada for 300 miles,\r\naccompanied by a dislocation of 3,000 to 10,000 feet.[44]\r\n\r\nThe anticlinal of the Park Range of the Rocky Mountains was cleft down\r\nthe axis, and the eastern half depressed 10,000 feet. And Mr. J. P.\r\nLesley gives an account of a fault in the Appalachians of not less than\r\n20,000 feet, bringing the upper Devonian strata on the one side opposite\r\nto the lowest Cambrian on the other.[45]\r\n\r\nA fault with a vertical displacement of 20,000 feet was found in the\r\nUinta Mountains.[46]\r\n\r\nIn the Aqui range of mountains, Utah, there is a fault determined by Mr.\r\nS. F. Emmons to be at least 10,000 feet.[47]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Cañon of Colorado, in some places 4,000, 5,000, and 6,000 feet\r\nin depth, is cut, says Professor A. Winchell, in a plateau which has\r\nitself been lowered by erosion to the extent of 10,000 feet; and this\r\nplateau occupies an area of 13,000 to 15,000 square miles.[48]\r\n\r\nThe Grand “Wash Fault,” Colorado, has a downthrow to the west of 6,000\r\nfeet. The “Hurricane Fault,” close to it, has displaced the strata to\r\nthe extent of over 12,000 feet.[49]\r\n\r\nIn the Valley of East Tennessee, Appalachian Mountains, it has been\r\nshown by Mr. J. P. Lesley that as much as 35,000 feet of rock have been\r\nremoved by denudation. But this being from an anticlinal arch, it does\r\nnot, of course, afford any measure of the extent of the denudation of\r\nthe surrounding country. Major J. W. Powell, Director of the U.S. Geol.\r\nSurvey, found that under a similar condition as much as three and a half\r\nmiles of strata have been removed by denudation from the top of\r\nanticlinal beds in the Uinta Mountains.[50]\r\n\r\nProbably the most enormous displacement of strata which has yet been\r\nfound is that of the “Wahsatch Fault,” Utah. This fault is about 100\r\nmiles in length, crossing the fortieth parallel of latitude from north\r\nto south, with a downthrow to the west of not less than 40,000 feet. So\r\nclear is the evidence regarding this fault that Mr. Clarence King says\r\n“that there can be no doubt of the quantitative correctness of my\r\nreading of this tremendous dislocation.”[51]\r\n\r\nThere are other modes than the foregoing by means of which geologists\r\nare enabled to measure the thickness of strata which may have been\r\nremoved in places off the present surface of the country. Into the\r\ndetails of these I need not here enter; but I may give a few examples of\r\nthe enormous extent to which the country, in some places, has been found\r\nto have been lowered by denudation.\r\n\r\nDr. A. Geikie has shown[52] that the Pentlands must at one time have\r\nbeen covered with Carboniferous rocks, upwards of a mile in thickness,\r\nwhich have all been removed by denudation.\r\n\r\nIn the Bristol coal-fields, between the river Avon and the Mendips, Sir\r\nAndrew C. Ramsay has shown[53] that about 9,000 feet of Carboniferous\r\nstrata have been removed by denudation from the present surface.\r\n\r\nBetween Bendrick Rock and Garth Hill, South Glamorganshire, a mass of\r\nCarboniferous and Old Red Sandstone, of upwards of 9,000 feet, has been\r\nremoved. At the Vale of Towy, Caermarthenshire, about 6,000 feet of\r\nSilurian and 5,000 feet of Old Red Sandstone—in all about 11,000\r\nvertical feet—have been swept away. Between Llandovery and Aberaeron a\r\nmass of about 12,000 vertical feet of the Silurian series has been\r\nremoved by denudation. Between Ebwy and the Forest of Dean, a distance\r\nof upwards of 20 miles, a thickness of rock varying from 5,000 to 10,000\r\nfeet has been abstracted.\r\n\r\nProf. Hull found[54] on the northern flanks of the Pendle Range,\r\nLancashire, the Permian beds resting on the denuded edges of the\r\nMillstone Grit, and these were again observed resting on the Upper\r\nCoal-measures south of the Wigan coal-field. Now from the known\r\nthickness of the Carboniferous series in this part of Lancashire he was\r\nenabled to calculate approximately the quantity of Carboniferous strata\r\nwhich must have been carried away between the period of the Millstone\r\nGrit and the deposition of the Permian beds, and found that it actually\r\namounted to no less than 9,900 feet. He also found in the Vale of\r\nClitheroe, and at the base of the Pendle Range, that the Coal-measures,\r\nthe whole of the Millstone Grit, the Yoredale series, and part of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone, amounting in all to nearly 20,000 feet, had\r\nbeen swept away—an amount of denudation which, as Prof. Hull remarks,\r\ncannot fail to impress us with some idea of the prodigious lapse of time\r\nnecessary for its accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: _Geology of Canada_, 1863, p. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Safford’s _Geology of Tennessee_, p. 309.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Lyell’s _Student’s Manual_, chap. xxiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Geological Studies_, by Prof. A.

Survey of Scotland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: _Denudation of South Wales._ _Memoirs of Geol. Survey_,\r\nvol. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxiv. p. 323.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that, enormous as is the amount of denudation\r\nindicated by the foregoing figures, these figures do not represent in\r\nmost cases the actual thickness of rock removed from the surface. We are\r\nnecessitated to conclude that a mass of rock equal to the thickness\r\nstated must have been removed, but we are in most cases left in\r\nuncertainty as to the total thickness which has actually been carried\r\naway. It cannot be imagined that these great disruptions occurred first\r\nwhen the surface became subject to denuding agencies, or that denudation\r\nceased to operate precisely when the inequality was smoothed away.\r\nMoreover, during the time the surface on one side of the fault was being\r\nreduced, some amount of denudation must also have been in progress on\r\nthe other and lower side. In the case of a fault, for example, with a\r\ndisplacement of, say, one mile, where no indication of it is seen at the\r\nsurface of the ground, we know that on one side of the fault a thickness\r\nof rock equal to one mile must have been denuded, but we do not know how\r\nmuch more than that may have been removed. For anything which we know to\r\nthe contrary, hundreds of feet of rock may have been removed before the\r\ndislocation took place, and as many more hundreds after all indications\r\nof dislocation had been effaced at the surface.\r\n\r\nBut it must be observed that the total quantity of rock which has been\r\nremoved from the _present_ surface of the land is evidently small in\r\nproportion to the total quantity removed during the past history of our\r\nglobe. For those thousands and thousands of feet of rock which have been\r\ndenuded were formed out of the waste of previously existing rocks, just\r\nas these had been formed out of the waste of yet older rock-masses. In\r\nshort, as a general rule, the rocks of one epoch have been formed out of\r\nthose of preceding periods, and go themselves to form those of\r\nsubsequent epochs.\r\n\r\nIn many of the cases of enormous denudation to which we have referred,\r\nthe erosion has been effected during a limited geological epoch. We\r\nhave, for example, seen that upwards of a mile in thickness of\r\nCarboniferous rock has been denuded in the area of the Pentlands. But\r\nthe Pentlands themselves, it can be proved, existed as hills, in much\r\ntheir present form, before the Carboniferous rocks were laid down over\r\nthem; and as they are of Lower Old Red Sandstone age, and have been\r\nformed by denudation, they must consequently have been carved out of the\r\nsolid rock between the period of the Old Red Sandstone and the beginning\r\nof the Carboniferous age. This affords us some conception of the immense\r\nlapse of time represented by the Middle and Upper Old Red Sandstone\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the case of the great fault separating the Silurians of the\r\nsouth of Scotland from the Old Red Sandstone tracts lying to the north,\r\na thickness of the latter strata of probably more than a mile, as we\r\nhave seen, must have been removed from the ground to the south of the\r\nfault before the commencement of the Carboniferous period. And again, in\r\nthe case of the Lancashire coal-fields, to which reference has been\r\nmade, nearly two miles in thickness of strata had been removed in the\r\ninterval which elapsed between the Millstone Grit and the Permian\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n_Time required to effect the foregoing amount of denudation._—To lower\r\nthe country one mile by denudation would therefore require, according to\r\nthe rate which we have already established, about 15,000,000 years; but\r\nwe have seen that a thickness of rock more than equal to that must have\r\nbeen swept away since the Carboniferous period; and even during the\r\nCarboniferous period itself more than a mile in thickness of strata in\r\nmany places was removed. Again, there can be no doubt whatever that the\r\namount of rock removed during the Old Red Sandstone period was much\r\ngreater than one mile; for we know perfectly well that over large tracts\r\nof country nearly a mile in thickness of rock was carried away _between\r\nthe period of the Lower Old Red Sandstone and the Carboniferous epoch_.\r\nFurther, all geological facts go to show that the time represented by\r\nthe Lower Old Red Sandstone itself must have been enormous.\r\n\r\nNow, three miles of rock removed since the commencement of the Old Red\r\nSandstone period (which, doubtless, is an under-estimate) would give us\r\n45,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nAgain, going farther back, we find the lapse of time represented by the\r\nSilurian period to be even more striking than that of the Old Red\r\nSandstone. The unconformities in the Silurian series indicate that many\r\nthousands of feet of these strata were denuded before overlying members\r\nof the same great formations were deposited. And again, this immense\r\nformation was formed in the ocean by the slow denudation of pre-existing\r\nCambrian continents, just as these had been built up out of the ruins of\r\nthe still prior Laurentian land. And even here we do not reach the end\r\nof the series, for the Laurentians themselves resulted from the\r\ndenudation, not of the primary rocks of the globe, but of previously\r\nexisting sedimentary and probably igneous rocks, of which, perhaps, no\r\nrecognisable portion now remains.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of Mr. Darwin, and also of Mr. Wallace, that the\r\ngeological time which elapsed anterior to the Cambrian period was as\r\nlong as the whole interval from that period to the present day. This is\r\nan opinion which I suppose is supported by most geologists. But, to err\r\non the safe side, I shall assume that the time which had elapsed prior\r\nto the Old Red Sandstone was not greater than the time which has elapsed\r\nsince that period. Even on this assumption we have at least 90,000,000\r\nyears as a minimum duration of geological time.\r\n\r\n_Age of the earth as determined by the date of the glacial\r\nepoch._—Professor A. Winchell, by a most careful examination of the\r\nprobable relative lengths of geological periods, arrived at the\r\nconclusion that the time which elapsed since the beginning of the\r\n_glacial epoch_ is to the time which has elapsed since the\r\nsolidification of the earth’s surface as 1 to 250.[55] According to the\r\neccentricity theory of the cause of the glacial epoch, that epoch began\r\n240,000 years ago; consequently this makes the time since solidification\r\ntook place 60,000,000 years, a period which agrees roughly with that\r\ndeduced from denudation, and is so far presumptive evidence of the truth\r\nof that theory of the cause of the glacial cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _World Life_, p. 369.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Testimony of Biology_.—The time required for the variation and\r\nmodification of organic forms has, Mr. Alfred R. Wallace states, been\r\ngenerally considered to require an even longer series of ages than might\r\nsatisfy the demands of physical geology. This is a point, however, on\r\nwhich I am not qualified to venture an opinion. I shall simply refer to\r\nthe views held by our highest authorities on the subject.\r\n\r\nReferring to Professor Huxley’s anniversary address to the Geological\r\nSociety in 1870, where he shows that almost all the higher forms of life\r\nmust have existed during the Palæozoic period, Mr. Wallace says: “Thus,\r\nfrom the fact that almost the whole of the Tertiary period has been\r\nrequired to convert the ancestral Orohippus into the true horse, he,\r\nProfessor Huxley, believes that, in order to have time for the much\r\ngreater change of the ancestral ungulata into the two great odd-toed and\r\neven-toed divisions (of which change there is no trace even among the\r\nearliest Eocene mammals), we should require a large portion, if not the\r\nwhole, of the Mesozoic or Secondary period. Another case is furnished by\r\nthe bats and whales, both of which strange modifications of the\r\nmammalian type occur perfectly developed in the Eocene formation. What\r\ncountless ages back must we, then, go for the origin of these groups,\r\nthe whales from some ancestral carnivorous animal, and the bats from the\r\ninsectivora! And even then we have to seek for the common origin of\r\ncarnivora, insectivora, ungulata, and marsupials at a far earlier\r\nperiod; so that, on the lowest estimate, we must place the origin of the\r\nmammalia very far back in Palæozoic times.”[56]\r\n\r\n“If the very small differences,” says Professor Huxley,[57] “which are\r\nobservable between the _Crocodilia_ of the older Mesozoic formations and\r\nthose of the present day furnish any sort of approximation towards an\r\nestimate of the average rate of change among the _Sauropsida_, it is\r\nalmost appalling to reflect how far back in Palæozoic times we must go\r\nbefore we can hope to arrive at that common stock from which the\r\n_Crocodilia_, _Lacertilia_, _Ornithoscelida_, and _Plesiosauria_, which\r\nhad attained so great a development in the Triassic epoch, must have\r\nbeen derived.\r\n\r\n“The _Amphibia_ and _Pisces_ tell the same story. There is not a single\r\nclass of vertebrated animals which, when it first appears, is\r\nrepresented by analogues of the lowest known members of the same class.\r\nTherefore, if there is any truth in the doctrine of evolution, every\r\nclass must be vastly older than the first record of its appearance upon\r\nthe surface of the globe. But if considerations of this kind compel us\r\nto place the origin of vertebrated animals at a period sufficiently\r\ndistant from the Upper Silurian, in which the first Elasmobranchs and\r\nGanoids occur, to allow of the evolution of such fishes as these from a\r\nvertebrate as simple as the _Amphioxus_, I can only repeat that it is\r\nappalling to speculate upon the extent to which that origin must have\r\npreceded the epoch of the first recorded appearance of vertebrate life.”\r\n\r\n“If the theory be true,” says Mr. Darwin, “it is indisputable that\r\nbefore the lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed—as\r\nlong as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the\r\nCambrian age to the present day; and that during these vast periods the\r\nworld swarmed with living creatures.”[58]\r\n\r\nIn referring to the abundant and well-developed fauna of the Cambrian\r\nperiod, Sir Andrew C. Ramsay remarks:[59] “In this earliest known varied\r\nlife we find no evidence of its having lived near the beginning of the\r\nZoological series. In a broad sense, compared with what must have gone\r\nbefore, both biologically and physically, all the phenomena connected\r\nwith this old period seem, to my mind, to be quite of a recent\r\ndescription; and the climates of seas and lands were of the very same\r\nkind as those that the world enjoys at the present day—one proof of\r\nwhich, in my opinion, is the existence of great glacial boulder beds in\r\nthe Lower Silurian strata of Wigtonshire, west of Loch Ryan.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Haeckel remarks that “Darwin’s theory, as well as that of\r\nLyell, renders the assumption of immense periods absolutely necessary.\r\nIf the theory of development be true at all, there must certainly have\r\nelapsed immense periods, utterly inconceivable to us.”\r\n\r\nIn reference to the foregoing, Mr. Wallace says:[60] “These opinions,\r\nand the facts on which they are founded, are so weighty that we can\r\nhardly doubt that, if the time since the Cambrian epoch is correctly\r\nestimated at 200,000,000 of years,[61] the date of the commencement of\r\nlife on the earth cannot be much less than 500,000,000; while it may not\r\nimprobably have been longer, because the reaction of the organism under\r\nchanges of the environment is believed to have been less active in low\r\nand simple than in high and complex forms of life, and thus the\r\nprocesses of organic development may for countless ages have been\r\nexcessively slow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Island Life_, p. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Quart. Journ. of Geol. Soc._ vol. xxvi. p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _Origin of Species_, p. 286.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, No. 152, 1874, p.\r\n342.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Island Life_, p. 205.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Of course, Mr. Wallace does not believe that it is\r\nactually 200,000,000 years since the Cambrian period.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it must now be perfectly evident that the facts both of geology\r\nand of biology are utterly irreconcilable with the theory that the sun’s\r\nheat was derived from the condensation of its mass by gravitation; and\r\nthat the mistake in regard to geological time has been committed by the\r\nphysicist, and not by the geologist. The grounds upon which the\r\ngeologists and the biologists found the conclusion that it is more than\r\n20 or 30 millions of years since life began on the earth are far more\r\ncertain and reliable than the grounds upon which the physicist concludes\r\nthat the period must be less. The only real ground that the physicist\r\nhas is that according to the theory which he holds of the origin of the\r\nsun’s heat a longer period is not possible. This might be considered\r\ngood evidence were no other theory possible; but there is another\r\ntheory, which accords with all the facts, and consequently has a strong\r\npresumption in its favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART III.\r\n\r\n _EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE THEORY FROM THE PRE-NEBULAR CONDITION OF THE\r\n    UNIVERSE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nebular hypothesis, strictly speaking, is one simply intended to\r\naccount for the origin of our solar system. “It is,” as remarks\r\nProfessor A. Winchell, “primarily a genetic explanation of the phenomena\r\nof the solar system; and accessorily a co-ordination, in a common\r\nconception, of the principal phenomena in the stellar and nebular\r\nfirmament, as far as human vision has been able to penetrate.”[62] The\r\ntheory starts with the assumption that all the materials composing the\r\nsolar system once existed in a state of extreme tenuity and diffusion,\r\nfilling far more than the entire space included within the orbit of the\r\nmost remote planet. It begins with this diffused nebulous mass tending\r\nslowly, under the influence of gravitation, towards a state of\r\naggregation. Beyond this point the received nebular hypothesis does not\r\nextend.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _World Life_, p. 196.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the theory here begins in the middle of a\r\nprocess. It begins with the assumption of a mass in the act of\r\ncondensing under the influence of gravity. It offers no explanation of\r\nthe origin of the mass, or how it came to be in this attenuated state,\r\nor in what condition it existed before the materials began to draw\r\ntogether. These are, however, inquiries which naturally force themselves\r\non our attention. If the nebular theory be a true theory of the origin\r\nof the solar system, then this nebulous mass must have had an antecedent\r\nhistory, and we cannot help feeling the instinctive desire of tracing\r\nthe chain of causation farther back. The mind presses towards an\r\nabsolute beginning. It is the goal to which it aspires, and no amount of\r\nfailure will ever deter it from renewing its efforts. Of recent years a\r\nconsiderable amount of attention has been devoted to inquiries in this\r\ndirection; nearly all of which, it is true, has necessarily been of a\r\nspeculative and hypothetical character. But hypothesis, as Mr. Locyker\r\nremarks, is the life-blood of investigation.\r\n\r\nThe nebular hypothesis is so highly probable as to have gained almost\r\nuniversal acceptance. In fact, it contains very little of a hypothetical\r\nnature. It is, as Mr. Mill says, “an example of legitimate reasoning\r\nfrom a present effect to its past cause, according to the known laws of\r\nthat cause.” Like the hypothesis of a luminiferous ether, if it is not a\r\ntrue theory, one would almost think that it deserves to be so.\r\n\r\nThere seems no reason why inquiries should stop at the point where\r\nLaplace began. The same line of reasoning may yet carry us back into the\r\npre-nebular region, and perhaps with as great a degree of certainty as\r\nit has done in the nebular; though, no doubt, the farther back we\r\nproceed, the more difficult probably will the inquiry become. But, be\r\nall this as it may, there can be little doubt that the path of\r\ninvestigation is a legitimate one, and also one which is worthy of being\r\ntraced out.\r\n\r\nI shall now briefly refer to some of the leading views which have been\r\nexpressed in regard to the pre-nebular history of the universe, and\r\nshall afterwards consider the additional light which the theory\r\ndiscussed in this volume seems to cast on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe commonly received opinion is that the nebulæ were formed from\r\nordinary matter existing in a high state of division, and widely\r\ndiffused through space. The “cosmical dust,” as it is called, was the\r\nuniversal “world-stuff,” out of which all things were supposed to be\r\nformed. It is held that in receding backwards in pre-nebular times, the\r\nsmaller, more simple, and elementary the materials were. Out of this\r\nprimitive cosmical dust, or world-stuff, by aggregation, the materials\r\nbecame successively larger and more complex. The theory of the origin of\r\nnebulæ, on this principle, has been clearly stated by Professor\r\nWinchell, and I here give a brief outline of his views on the subject.\r\n\r\n_Professor A. Winchell on the pre-nebular condition of matter._—This\r\ncosmical dust, or world-stuff, he considers to be scattered\r\npromiscuously through boundless space. It is cold and non-luminous, and\r\nis acted upon by forces of attraction and probably of repulsion. The\r\nmaterial particles, either as atoms or less probably as molecules, are\r\ndrawn by mutual attraction into groups and swarms. Any central\r\nattractive force, as of a sun or planet, by causing the particles to\r\nmove in converging lines, would cause them to become approximated and\r\nultimately aggregated. Thus both mutual attractions and centric\r\nmovements would tend to produce aggregations dispersed through space.\r\nBut in the presence of two or more attractive centres, as in the present\r\nconstitution of the Cosmos, it is impossible that any mass shall fall\r\ndirectly upon its centre of attraction. Hence motions of rotation will\r\nbe established in the mass, and also orbital motions of masses about\r\neach other. In addition to the mutual attraction of the molecules, the\r\nconvergence of their paths towards centres of attraction must also tend\r\nto the formation of masses and swarms of masses and particles. “We have\r\nthen,” he says, “to picture indefinite space as pervaded by swarms of\r\nmasses and particles of dark matter. Each mass or particle may,\r\nnevertheless, be separated by thousands of miles. It is manifest,\r\ntherefore, that each mass or particle will eventually dispose itself,\r\nunder the fixed action of the forces of matter, in some definite order.\r\nIt is manifest also, from what has been said, that each swarm will have\r\na progressive motion along a path having the essential character of an\r\norbit around some dominant centre of attraction. If, as seems to be the\r\nfact, an ethereal medium, or any condition of interplanetary matter,\r\nexists in space, it opposes the movements of these swarms by opposing\r\nthe motion of each constituent mass. But the smaller masses—the\r\nparticles and molecules—would feel this resistance to the greatest\r\nextent. They would therefore fall behind the heavier masses, and would\r\nbe most deflected toward the attracting centre. The smallest particles\r\nwould be driven farthest to the rear, and dispersed farthest from the\r\norbit of the train, along the side turned toward the principal\r\nattraction. The swarm would present an elongated form, in which the\r\nlarger and heavier masses would move foremost, and nearest the line of\r\nthe orbit—that is, near the exterior skirt of the area covered by the\r\ngeneral swarm—while the smaller ones would follow, in graduated\r\nsuccession, in a long train which would present a fan-like expansion\r\nlying mostly on the inside of the path of the principal masses.”\r\n\r\n“This, it may be conceived, is the mode of aggregation of these cosmical\r\nmatters in the depths of space. Of course the attractions which control\r\nthem are feeble; their movements are slow, the resistances are\r\nrelatively inconsiderable, and the elongation of the swarm is\r\ncorrespondingly inconspicuous. What I have described is a tendency which\r\nwould be present. Sometimes the controlling attraction would be only\r\nanother cosmical swarm. The two swarms would revolve similarly about\r\ntheir common centre of gravity, while prolonged resistances would cause\r\ntheir slow approximation and final coalescence at the common centre of\r\ngravity. Sometimes the controlling attraction would be exerted by a\r\ndistant sun, around which it would slowly move, continually gathering up\r\nadditions of matter from the wide fields of space.”\r\n\r\n“In most cases all controlling attraction would be feebly felt. These\r\nclouds of cosmical dust would float practically poised in the midst of\r\nspace, and would gradually grow by the continued accession of new\r\nmatter. Some of them would become aggregates of large dimensions, and\r\ntheir attraction would be distinctly felt by other aggregates. There\r\nwould be a tendency of such aggregates to approach each other. They\r\nmight possibly approach along a straight line; but more probably some\r\nthird aggregation, or some distant sun, would deflect them into orbits\r\nabout their common centre of gravity, in which, by prolonged collisions\r\nof cosmical matter, they are brought to ultimate coalescence with each\r\nother. Or some other attractive disturbance affords such a resultant of\r\nactions as may bring them more directly together. When these larger\r\naggregations of world-stuff come together, the result is an aggregation\r\napproaching the dimensions of the Herschellian nebulæ.”[63]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _World Life_, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the origin of the heat of the nebulæ, I am glad to find\r\nthat Professor Winchell, to a certain extent, adopts the views which I\r\nhave so long entertained on the subject. “The thought,” he says, “must\r\nalready have suggested itself to the reader that the process of\r\nconglomeration affords an explanation of the intense heat which\r\nvaporises its substance, and causes it to yield a spectrum of bright\r\nlines. As the sudden compression of a portion of atmospheric air yields\r\nheat sufficient to ignite tinder, or fuse and volatilise a descending\r\nmeteor-mass, so the precipitation of one planet upon another would\r\nliberate sufficient heat to reduce them both to a state of fusion, or\r\neven of vapour. Still more must the intensest heat be generated by the\r\nimpact of two nebulous masses, one or both of which together may embrace\r\nmore matter than all our planets and the sun combined—as much even as\r\nthe matter of our entire visible firmament of stars. One experiences a\r\ndistinct feeling of relief in the discovery of such a possible means of\r\nignition of nebulæ.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Charles Morris on the pre-nebular condition of matter._—Others\r\nagain suppose matter to be present everywhere throughout space. This\r\nview has been ingeniously advocated by Mr. Charles Morris in an article\r\non “The Matter of Space,” which appeared in _Nature_, February 8, 1883.\r\nThe hypothesis of an ether specially distinct from matter he considers\r\nto be a gratuitous assumption, and one of the last surviving relics of\r\neighteenth century science, and, unless it can be proved that highly\r\ndisintegrated matter is positively incapable of conveying light\r\nvibrations, there is no warrant for assigning this duty to a distinct\r\nform of substance. But that matter exists in outer space in the same\r\nconditions as in planetary atmospheres he thinks is improbable. Its duty\r\nas a conveyer of radiant vibrations seems to require a far greater\r\ntensity, and its disintegration is probably extreme. Assuming matter\r\nthroughout the universe—here as condensed spheres, and there in outer\r\nspace as highly rarified substance—the atmospheric envelopes of the\r\nspheres, he considers, will gradually shade off into the excessively\r\nrare matter of mid-space. Matter may exist in countless conditions as to\r\nsimplicity and complexity, &c., but the base particle he assumes to be\r\nthe same under all conditions. In the spheres there is matter ranging\r\nfrom the simplest elementary gases, through the mineral compounds of the\r\nsolid surface, to the highly compounded organic molecules. In outer\r\nspace the variation is in the opposite direction; the matter existing\r\nthere in a highly disintegrated condition.\r\n\r\nEvery particle he considers to possess a certain amount of motor energy\r\nin the form of heat. As the total amount of this energy in the universe\r\nremains unchanged, a particle can only lose energy by transferring it to\r\nothers. This heat energy acts, of course, in opposition to gravity: it\r\ntends to repel the particles from each other, while gravity, on the\r\nother hand, tends to draw them together. The former acts as a\r\ncentrifugal, the latter as a centripetal energy. If the heat momentum of\r\nthe particles be insufficient to constitute a centrifugal energy equal\r\nto the centripetal energy of gravitation, then the material contents of\r\nspace will be drawn into the attracting spheres as atmospheric\r\nsubstance, and outer space, in this case, will be left destitute of\r\nmatter. If, on the contrary, the centrifugal energy of the particles be\r\nsufficient to resist gravitation, then the particles will remain free,\r\nand space will continue to be occupied with matter. As has been stated,\r\nthe sum of motor energy in the universe remaining unchanged, the\r\naggregation of atmospheric substance around any planet resulting from\r\nthe loss of motor energy must cause an increase of motor energy in the\r\nparticles outside.\r\n\r\nThe theory seems to dispense with the necessity for assuming a\r\nluminiferous ether, for the functions attributed to the ether may, it is\r\nthought, be performed by the particles themselves; a view which has been\r\nadvocated by Euler, Grove, and others. The origin of nebulæ, according\r\nto the theory, is accounted for as follows:\r\n\r\n“The nebular hypothesis,” says Mr. Morris, “holds that the matter now\r\nconcentrated into suns and planets was once more widely disseminated, so\r\nthat the substance of each sphere occupied a very considerable extent of\r\nspace. It even declares that the matter of the solar system was a\r\nnebulous cloud, extending far beyond the present limits of that system.\r\nFrom this original condition the existing condition of the spheres has\r\narisen through a continued concentration of matter. But this\r\nconcentration was constantly opposed by the heat energy of the\r\nparticles, or, in other words, by their centrifugal momentum. This\r\nmomentum could only be got rid of by a redistribution of motor energy.\r\nIf, for illustration, the average momentum of the particles of the\r\nnebulæ was just equivalent to their gravitative energy, then a portion\r\nof this energy must radiate or be conducted outwards ere the internal\r\nparticles could be held prisoners by gravitation. The loss of momentum\r\ninwardly must be correlated with an increase of momentum outwardly.\r\n\r\n“This is a necessary consequence of the heat relations of matter. As\r\nsubstance condenses, its capacity for heat decreases and its temperature\r\nrises, hence a difference of temperature must constantly have arisen\r\nbetween the denser and the rarer portions of the nebulous mass, and\r\nequality of temperature could be restored only by heat radiation. This\r\nradiation still continues, and must continue until condensation ceases\r\nand the temperatures of the spheres and space become equalised; but this\r\nis equivalent to declaring that as the particles of the spheres decrease\r\nin heat momentum those of interspheral space increase, and if originally\r\nthe centrifugal and centripetal energies of matter approached equality\r\nthey must become unequal, centripetal energy becoming in excess in\r\nspheral matter, centrifugal energy in the matter of space. Thus, as a\r\nportion of the widely distributed nebulous matter lost its heat, and\r\nbecame permanently fixed in place by gravitative attraction, another\r\nportion gained heat, became still more independent of gravity, and\r\nassumed a state of greater nebulous diffusion than originally. The\r\ncondensing spheres only denuded space of a portion of the matter which\r\nit formerly held, and left the remainder more thinly distributed than\r\nbefore. The spheres, in their concentration, have emitted, and are\r\nemitting, a vast energy of motion. This motor energy yet exists in space\r\nas a motion of the particles of matter, which, therefore, press upon\r\neach other, or seek to extend their limits, with increasing vigour, so\r\nthat the elasticity of interspheral matter is constantly increasing.”\r\n\r\n_Sir William R. Grove on the pre-nebular condition of matter._—Amongst\r\nthe first to advocate the view that ordinary matter is everywhere\r\npresent in space was Sir William R. Grove. In a lecture delivered at the\r\nLondon Institution as far back as January 1842, he stated that it\r\nappeared to him that heat and light, according to the undulatory theory,\r\nwere the result of the vibrations of ordinary matter itself, and not\r\nthat of a distinct ethereal fluid. Twenty years afterwards, referring to\r\nthe views he then advanced, he says: “Although this theory has been\r\nconsidered defective by a philosopher of high repute, I cannot see the\r\nforce of the arguments by which it has been assailed; and, therefore,\r\nfor the present, though with diffidence, I still adhere to it.”[64]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _Correlation of Physical Forces_, p. 164 (fifth edition),\r\n1867.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe adduces a great many facts and forcible arguments in support of his\r\nposition. He says that “there appears no reason why the atmosphere of\r\nthe different planets should not be, with reference to each other, in a\r\nstate of equilibrium. Ether, or the highly attenuated matter existing in\r\nthe interplanetary space, being an expansion of some or all of these\r\natmospheres, or of the more volatile portions of them, would thus\r\nfurnish matter for the transmission of the modes of motion which we call\r\nlight, heat, &c.” It is assumed in the theory, of course, that matter\r\nmust form a universal planum.\r\n\r\nSir William Grove favours the idea that the universe is illimitable in\r\nextent, a view held by many eminent thinkers.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF THE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS, AND ITS RELATIONS TO STELLAR\r\n    EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the consideration of a subject which has a most important\r\nbearing on the question of stellar evolution, viz. the genesis and\r\ndissociation of the chemical elements. The evolution of one element from\r\nanother is, it is true, as yet but a mere hypothesis, but it is an\r\nhypothesis well supported by a host of facts and considerations, and\r\nheld by a large number of our leading chemists and physicists. “The\r\ndemonstrated unity of force,” says Professor F. W. Clarke,[65] “leads us\r\nby analogy to expect a similar unity of matter; and the many strange and\r\nhitherto unexplained relations between the different elements tend to\r\nencourage our expectations.” The hypothesis throws much light on some\r\nobscure points in stellar evolution. In regard to this, Professor Clarke\r\njustly remarks that “it is plain that the nebular hypothesis would be\r\ndoubled in importance, and our views of the universe greatly expanded,\r\nif it could be shown that an evolution of complex from simple forms of\r\nmatter accompanied the development of planets from the nebulæ. Evolution\r\ncould look for no grander triumph.” In fact, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand how our sun and the stars could have been evolved from nebulæ\r\nwithout assuming an evolution of the chemical elements. The true nebulæ\r\nshow the presence of only two elements, nitrogen and hydrogen, but our\r\nsun contains more than a dozen of distinct elements, and the planets\r\nmore than three times that number. How, then, could all these have\r\narisen out of nebulæ composed simply of nitrogen and hydrogen? The\r\nmatter is plain if we assume an evolution of the elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _Popular Science Monthly_ for January 1873.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars have been classed into four groups, which, as Professor Clarke\r\nhas remarked, indicate different stages in the process of evolution. The\r\nfirst class, containing white stars like Sirius, show the predominance\r\nof hydrogen and a scarcity of the metallic elements. In the second class\r\nthe metallic elements become more numerous and the hydrogen less\r\ndistinct; while in the third class hydrogen is difficult to detect.[66]\r\nThis seems to show a gradual development of the chemical elements as the\r\nstar cools and grows older. I shall now give a brief account of the\r\nviews expressed on the subject by some of our leading physicists and\r\nchemists.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: See also on this point Mr. Lockyer’s “Bakerian Lecture,”\r\n_Proc. Roy. Soc._ No. 266, p. 21.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, in reference to the theories we have just\r\nconsidered, that the process of evolution is supposed to take place from\r\nthe smaller to the larger aggregates of matter. Beginning with an\r\nextreme condition of tenuity, by aggregation, the materials become\r\nsuccessively larger and more complex. In passing backwards in the\r\nprocess we find the aggregates becoming less and less till they reach\r\nthe “cosmical dust,” or “fire-mist,” out of which the primitive nebulæ\r\nwere supposed to be formed. Receding still farther back, we have the\r\nuniversal atmosphere from which the fire-mist is assumed to have been\r\nderived.\r\n\r\nThis universal atmosphere, though in a state of extreme tenuity, is, as\r\nwe shall see, supposed by some to be in a more elemental form than\r\nanything revealed to us in the laboratory. The suggestion of the\r\ndissociation of the chemical elements and its application to stellar\r\nphysics was, I think, first advanced by Sir Benjamin Brodie in 1866, and\r\nmore fully in 1867. In the latter year views similar were considered\r\nmore fully by Dr. T. Sterry Hunt. The question of the dissociation of\r\nelements has been ably discussed by Mr. Lockyer in his various writings.\r\nIt has been suggested by Mr. Lockyer that the coincidence of rays\r\nemitted by different chemical elements when subjected to very high\r\ntemperatures affords evidence of a common element in the composition of\r\nthe metals producing the coincident rays. Mr. Lockyer states that many\r\ntrains of thought suggested by solar and stellar physics point to the\r\nhypothesis that the _elements themselves, or at all events some of them,\r\nare compound bodies_.[67] This view was also put forward by Professor\r\nGraham, who says “that it is conceivable that the various kinds of\r\nmatter now recognised in different elementary substances may possess one\r\nand the same element or atomic molecule existing in different conditions\r\nof mobility. The essential unity of matter,” he adds, “is an hypothesis\r\nin harmony with the equal action of gravity upon all bodies.” Similar\r\nviews have been advocated by M. Dumas, who based the suggestion of the\r\ncomposite nature of the elementary atoms on certain relations of atomic\r\nweights. The composite nature of the chemical elements has also been\r\nmaintained by Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, and also by Berthelot, who\r\nheld that the atoms of the elements are the same, and distinguished only\r\nby their modes of motion. Professor Schuster, in a paper read before the\r\nBritish Association in 1880, supports the view of the dissociation of\r\nthe chemical elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Proc. Roy. Soc._ vol. xxviii. p. 160.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat all the purely physical sciences will one day be brought under a\r\nfew general laws and principles, and the whole of the recognised\r\nchemical elements will be resolved into one or two material elements, is\r\na conclusion towards which physical science seems at present slowly\r\ntending. There is certainly something fascinating in this view of the\r\nunity of nature. There is in this idea more than a purely physical\r\ninterest attached to it. It has, as I hope to show in a future work, an\r\nimportant bearing on questions relating to the foundations of the true\r\ntheory of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe question of the unity of the chemical elements is one, however, yet\r\nin a hypothetical condition. Professors Liveing and Dewar, who have\r\ngiven attention to this subject, say: “The supposition that the\r\ndifferent elements may be resolved into simpler constituents, or into a\r\nsingle one, has long been a favourite speculation with chemists; but,\r\nhowever probable this hypothesis may appear _à priori_, it must be\r\nacknowledged that the facts derived from the most powerful method of\r\nanalytical investigation yet devised give it scant support.”[68]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _Proc. Roy. Soc._ vol. xxxii. p. 230.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Benjamin Brodie on the pre-nebular condition of matter._—There are,\r\nconsiders Sir Benjamin Brodie, very forcible reasons which lead us to\r\nsuspect that chemical substances are really composed of a primitive\r\nsystem of elemental bodies, analogous in their general nature to our\r\npresent elements: that some of those bodies which we speak of as\r\nelements may be compounds. These ideal elements assumed by him, he says,\r\n“though now revealed to us by the numerical properties of chemical\r\nequations only as _implicit and dependent existences_, we cannot but\r\nsurmise may sometimes become, or may in the past have been, _isolated\r\nand independent existences_”—as, for instance, in the case of the sun,\r\nwhere the temperature is excessive. “We may,” he further adds, “consider\r\nthat in remote ages the temperature of matter was much higher than it is\r\nnow, and that these other things [ideal elements] existed then in the\r\nstate of perfect gases—separate existences—uncombined.”[69] He then\r\nrefers to certain observations of Mr. Huggins and Dr. Miller on the\r\nspectra of nebulæ where one of the lines of nitrogen was found alone;\r\nand that this suggested to them that the line might have been produced\r\nby one of the elements of nitrogen; and that nitrogen may therefore be\r\ncompound. He mentions as a significant fact that a large proportion of\r\nthe class of elements which he has termed “composite elements” has not\r\nbeen found in the sun, they having probably been decomposed by the\r\nintense heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Ideal Chemistry_, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. T. Sterry Hunt on the pre-nebular condition of matter._—A year\r\nafter the foregoing views regarding chemical dissociation had been\r\nadvanced by Sir Benjamin Brodie, Dr. T. Sterry Hunt, in a lecture on\r\n“The Chemistry of the Primeval Earth,” delivered at the Royal\r\nInstitution (May 31, 1867), put forward, apparently quite independently,\r\nopinions on dissociation similar to those of Brodie. In this lecture he\r\nsays: “I considered the chemistry of nebulæ, sun, and stars in the\r\ncombined light of spectroscopic analysis and Deville’s researches on\r\ndissociation, and concluded with the generalisation that the breaking-up\r\nof compounds, or dissociation of elements, by intense heat is a\r\nprinciple of universal application, so that we may suppose that all the\r\nelements which make up the sun, or our planet, would, when so intensely\r\nheated as to be in the gaseous condition which all matter is capable of\r\nassuming, remain uncombined, that is to say, would exist together in the\r\nstate of chemical elements, whose further dissociation in stellar or\r\nnebulous masses may even give us evidence of matter still more elemental\r\nthan that revealed in the experiments of the laboratory, where we can\r\nonly conjecture the compound nature of many of the so-called elementary\r\nsubstances.”[70] And in his address at the grave of Priestley he\r\nreferred to the suggestion of Lavoisier that hydrogen, nitrogen, and\r\noxygen, with heat and light, might be regarded as simpler forms of\r\nmatter from which all others are derived. This suggestion was considered\r\nin connection with the fact that the nebulæ, which we conceive to be\r\ncondensing into suns and planets, have hitherto shown evidences only of\r\nthe presence of the first two of these elements, which, as is well\r\nknown, make up a large part of the gaseous envelope of our planet, in\r\nthe forms of air and aqueous vapour. With this he connected the\r\nhypothesis advanced by Grove, “that our atmosphere and ocean are but\r\nportions of the universal medium which, in an attenuated form, fills the\r\ninterstellary spaces;[71] and further suggested as a legitimate and\r\nplausible speculation that these same nebulæ and their resulting worlds\r\n_may be evolved by a process of chemical condensation from this\r\nuniversal atmosphere_, to which they would sustain a relation somewhat\r\nanalogous to that of clouds and rain to the aqueous vapour around us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _American Journal of Science_, vol. xxiii. p. 124.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: “Our atmosphere,” says Dr. Hunt, “is not terrestrial, but\r\ncosmical, being a universal medium diffused throughout all space, but\r\ncondensed around the various centres of attraction in amount\r\nproportional to their mass and temperature, the waters of the ocean\r\nthemselves belonging to this universal atmosphere.” (_Nature_, August\r\n29, 1878, p. 475.) Similar views have been advocated by Mr. Mattieu\r\nWilliams, who says “that the gaseous ocean, in which we are immersed, is\r\nbut a portion of the infinite atmosphere that fills the whole solidity\r\nof space; that links together all the elements of the universe, and\r\ndiffuses among them their heat and light, and all the other physical and\r\nvital forces which heat and light are capable of generating.” (_Fuel of\r\nthe Sun_, p. 5.) In 1854 Sir William Thomson suggested the idea that the\r\nluminiferous ether was probably a continuation of our atmosphere, though\r\nI do not think he continues to hold that opinion. The first to advance\r\nthis idea was, undoubtedly, Newton, who assumed interplanetary space to\r\nbe universally filled with an ethereal medium “much of the same\r\nconstitution as air, but far rarer, subtler, and more elastic.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Professor Oliver Lodge on the pre-nebular condition of matter._—Some\r\nhave gone still farther back and supposed that the material universe may\r\nhave arisen out of the luminiferous ether—the hypothetical medium which\r\nis assumed to pervade all space. The universal world-stuff scattered\r\nthrough boundless space may in an extreme state of attenuation be, says\r\nProfessor Winchell, the ethereal medium, and out of this semi-spiritual\r\nsubstance may have germinated the molecules of common matter. “It is\r\ncertainly possible,” he says, “to conceive these cosmical atoms as a\r\nrising-out of some transformation of the ethereal medium; but we know\r\ntoo little of the nature of ether to ground a scientific inference of\r\nthis kind.”[72]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: _World Life_, p. 533.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ethereal origin of matter has been advocated by M. Saigey, Dr.\r\nMacvicar, and others. In a lecture by Professor Oliver Lodge, delivered\r\nat the London Institution in December 1882, he also advocates the\r\nethereal origin of matter. “As far as we know,” to state his views in\r\nhis own words, “this ether appears to be a perfectly homogeneous,\r\nincompressible, continuous body, incapable of being resolved into simple\r\nelements or atoms; it is, in fact, continuous, not molecular. There is\r\nno other body of which we can say this, and hence the properties of\r\nether must be somewhat different from those of ordinary matter.” ...\r\n“One naturally asks, is there any such clear distinction to be drawn\r\nbetween ether and matter as we have hitherto tacitly assumed? May they\r\nnot be different modifications, or even manifestations, of the same\r\nthing?” He then adopts Sir William Thomson’s theory of vortex atoms,\r\ninto the details of which I need not here enter. In conclusion, says\r\nProfessor Lodge, “I have now endeavoured to introduce you to the\r\nsimplest conception of the material universe which has yet occurred to\r\nman—the conception that it is of one universal substance, perfectly\r\nhomogeneous and continuous, and simple in structure, extending to the\r\nfarthest limits of space of which we have any knowledge, existing\r\nequally everywhere: some portions either at rest or in simple\r\nirrotational motion, transmitting the undulations which we call light;\r\nother portions in rotational motion—in vortices, that is—and\r\ndifferentiated permanently from the rest of the medium by reason of this\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n“These whirling portions constitute what we call matter; their motion\r\ngives them rigidity, and of them our bodies and all other material\r\nbodies with which we are acquainted are built up.\r\n\r\n“One continuous substance filling all space, which can vibrate as light;\r\nwhich can be sheared into positive and negative electricity; which in\r\nwhirls constitutes matter; and which transmits by continuity, and not by\r\nimpact, every action and reaction of which matter is capable. This is\r\nthe modern view of ether and its functions.”[73]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _Nature_, February 1, 1883, p. 330.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is this objection to Professor Lodge’s theory: it is purely\r\nhypothetical. The vortex atoms are not only hypothetical, but the\r\nsubstance out of which these atoms are assumed to be formed is also\r\nitself hypothetical. We have no certain evidence that such a medium as\r\nis thus supposed exists, or that a medium possessing the qualities\r\nattributed to it could exist. In fact, we have here one hypothesis built\r\nupon another.\r\n\r\nThe vortex theory appears to me to be beset by a difficulty of another\r\nkind, viz. that of reconciling it with the First Law of Motion.\r\nAccording to that law no body possessing inertia can deviate from the\r\nstraight line unless forced to do so. A planet will not move round the\r\nsun unless it be constantly acted upon by a force deflecting it from the\r\nstraight path. A grindstone will not rotate on its axis unless its\r\nparticles are held together by a force preventing them from flying off\r\nat a tangent to the curve in which they are moving. Centrifugal force\r\nmust always be balanced by centripetal force. The difficulty is to\r\nunderstand what force counterbalances the centrifugal force of the\r\nrotating material of the vortex-atom. It is not because the centrifugal\r\ntendency of the rotating material is controlled by the exterior\r\nincompressible fluid, for it offers no resistance whatever to the\r\npassage of the atom through it—in short, in so far as the motion of the\r\natom is concerned, this fluid is a perfect void. Now, if this fluid can\r\noffer no resistance to the passage of the atom as a whole, how then does\r\nit manage to offer such enormous resistance to the materials composing\r\nthe atom, so as to continually deflect them from the straight path and\r\ncompel them to move in a curve? The centrifugal force of these\r\nvortex-atoms must be enormous, for on it is assumed to depend the\r\nhardness or resistance of matter to pressure. Now the centripetal force\r\nwhich balances this centrifugal force must be equally enormous. If,\r\nthen, this perfect fluid outside the vortex-atom can exert this enormous\r\nforce on the revolving material without being itself possessed of\r\nvortex-motion, there does not seem to be any necessity for vortex-motion\r\nin order to produce resistance. In short, how is the existence of the\r\natom possible under the physical conditions assumed in the theory? How\r\nthis may be, like the space of four dimensions, may be expressed in\r\nmathematical language, but like it, I fear, it is unthinkable as a\r\nphysical conception.\r\n\r\n_Mr. William Crookes on the pre-nebular condition of matter._—In his\r\nopening address before the Chemical Section of the British Association\r\nin 1886, Mr. William Crookes entered at considerable length into the\r\nquestion of the genesis and evolution of the chemical elements. I shall\r\nhere give a brief statement of his views as embodied in his important\r\naddress, and this I shall endeavour to do as nearly as possible in Mr.\r\nCrookes’s own words.\r\n\r\n“We ask,” says Mr. Crookes, “whether the chemical elements may not have\r\nbeen evolved from a few antecedent forms of matter—or possibly from only\r\none such—just as it is now held that all the innumerable variations of\r\nplants and animals have been developed from fewer and earlier forms of\r\norganic life: built up, as Dr. Gladstone remarks, from one another\r\naccording to some general plan. This building up, or evolution, is above\r\nall things not fortuitous: the variation and development which we\r\nrecognise in the universe run along certain fixed lines which have been\r\npreconceived and foreordained. To the careless and hasty eye design and\r\nevolution seem antagonistic; the more careful inquirer sees that\r\nevolution, steadily proceeding along an ascending scale of excellence,\r\nis the strongest argument in favour of a preconceived plan.”\r\n\r\nNow, as in the organic world, so in the inorganic, it seems natural to\r\nview the chemical elements not as primordial, but as the gradual outcome\r\nof a process of development, possibly even of a struggle for existence.\r\nBut this evolution of the elements must have taken place at a period so\r\nremote as to be difficult to grasp by the imagination, when our earth,\r\nor rather the matter of which it consists, was in a state very different\r\nfrom its present condition. The epoch of elemental development, remarks\r\nMr. Crookes, is decidedly over, and it may be observed that in the\r\nopinion of not a few biologists the epoch of organic development is\r\nverging upon its close.\r\n\r\nIs there then, in the first place, any direct evidence of the\r\ntransmutation of any supposed “element” of our existing list into\r\nanother, or of its resolution into anything simpler? To this question\r\nMr. Crookes answers in the negative.\r\n\r\nWe find ourselves thus driven to indirect evidence—to that which we may\r\nglean from the mutual relations of the elementary bodies. First, we may\r\nconsider the conclusion arrived at by Herschel, and pursued by\r\nClerk-Maxwell, that atoms bear the impress of manufactured articles. “A\r\nmanufactured article may well be supposed to involve a manufacturer. But\r\nit does something more: it implies certainly a raw material, and\r\nprobably, though not certainly, the existence of by-products, residues,\r\nparaleipomena. What or where is here the raw material? Can we detect any\r\nform of matter which bears to the chemical elements a relation like that\r\nof a raw material to the finished product, like that, say, of coal-tar\r\nto alizarin? Or can we recognise any elementary bodies which seem like\r\nwaste or refuse? Or are all the elements, according to the common view,\r\nco-equals? To these questions no direct answers are forthcoming.”\r\n\r\n_Argument from Prout’s Law._—The bearing of the hypothesis of Prout in\r\nrelation to the evolution of the elements is first considered by Mr.\r\nCrookes. If that hypothesis were demonstrated it would show that the\r\naccepted elements are not co-equal, but have been formed by a process of\r\nexpansion or evolution. According to this hypothesis the atomic weights\r\nof the elements are multiples by a series of whole numbers of the atomic\r\nweight of hydrogen. It is true that accurate determinations of the\r\natomic weights of different elements do not by any means harmonise with\r\nthe values which Prout’s Law requires; nevertheless the agreement in so\r\nmany cases is so close that one can scarcely regard the coincidence as\r\naccidental.\r\n\r\nThe atomic weights have been recalculated with extreme care by Professor\r\nF. W. Clarke, of Cincinnati, and he says that “none of the seeming\r\nexceptions are inexplicable. In short, admitting half-multiples as\r\nlegitimate, it is more probable that the few apparent exceptions are due\r\nto undetected constant errors than that the great number of close\r\nagreements should be merely accidental.” In reference to this suggestion\r\nof Professor Clarke, Mr. Crookes thinks that it places the matter upon\r\nan entirely new basis. For, suppose the unit atom to be not hydrogen,\r\nbut some element of still lower atomic weight, say _helium_, an element\r\nsupposed by many authorities to exist in the sun and other stellar\r\nbodies—an element whose spectrum consists of a single ray, and whose\r\nvapour possesses no absorbent power, which indicates a remarkable\r\nsimplicity of molecular constitution. Granting that helium exists, all\r\nanalogy points, says Mr. Crookes, to its atomic weight being below that\r\nof hydrogen; and here, then, we have the very element with atomic weight\r\nhalf that of hydrogen required by Professor Clarke as the basis of\r\nProut’s Law.\r\n\r\n_Argument from the earth’s crust._—The probable compound nature of the\r\nchemical elements, Mr. Crookes thinks, is better shown by a\r\nconsideration of certain peculiarities in their occurrence in the\r\nearth’s crust. “We do not,” he says, “find them evenly distributed\r\nthroughout the globe. Nor are they associated in accordance with their\r\nspecific gravities: the lighter elements placed on or near the surface,\r\nand the heavier ones following serially deeper and deeper. Neither can\r\nwe trace any distinct relation between local climate and mineral\r\ndistribution. And by no means can we say that elements are always or\r\nchiefly associated in nature in the order of their so-called chemical\r\naffinities: those which have a strong tendency to form with each other\r\ndefinite chemical combinations being found together, whilst those which\r\nhave little or no such tendency exist apart. We certainly find calcium\r\nas carbonate and sulphate, sodium as chloride, silver and lead as\r\nsulphides; but why do we find certain groups of elements, with little\r\naffinity for each other, yet existing in juxtaposition or commixture?”\r\n\r\nAs instances of such grouping he mentions nickel and cobalt; the two\r\ngroups of platinum metals; and the so-called “rare earths,” existing in\r\ngadolinite, samarskite, &c. Why, then, are these elements so closely\r\nassociated? What agency has brought them together? It cannot be\r\nconsidered that nickel and cobalt have been deposited in admixture by\r\norganic agency; nor yet the groups of iridium, osmium, and platinum;\r\nruthenium, rhodium, and palladium.\r\n\r\nThese features, Mr. Crookes thinks, seem to point to their formation\r\nseverally from some common material placed in conditions in each case\r\nnearly identical.\r\n\r\n_Argument from the compound radicals._—A strong argument in favour of\r\nthe compound nature of the elements, Mr. Crookes thinks, is derived from\r\na consideration of their analogy to the compound radicals, or\r\npseudo-elements as they might be called. It may be fairly held that if a\r\nbody known to be compound is found behaving as an element, this fact\r\nlends plausibility to the supposition that the elements are not\r\nabsolutely simple. From a comparison of the physical properties of\r\ninorganic with those of organic compounds, Dr. Carnelley concluded that\r\nthe elements, as a whole, are analogous to the hydrocarbon radicals.\r\nThis conclusion, if true, he added, should lead to the further inference\r\nthat the so-called elements are not truly elementary, but are made up of\r\nat least two absolute elements, which he named provisionally A and B.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Carnelley’s scheme all the chemical elements save hydrogen are\r\nsupposed to be composed of two simpler elements, A = 12 and B = 2. Of\r\nthese he regards A as a tetrad identical with carbon, and B as a monad\r\nof negative weight; perhaps the ethereal fluid of space. His three\r\nprimary elements are, therefore, carbon, hydrogen, and the ether.\r\n\r\n_Argument from polymerisation._—The polymeristic theory of the genesis\r\nof the chemical elements propounded by Dr. Mills falls next to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by Dr. E. J. Mills that the pristine matter was\r\nonce in an intensely heated condition, and that it has reached its\r\npresent state by a process of free cooling, and that the elements, as we\r\nnow have them, are the result of successive polymerisations. Chemical\r\nsubstances in cooling naturally increase in density, and we sometimes\r\nobserve that as the density increases there are critical points\r\ncorresponding to the formation of new and well-defined substances. The\r\nbodies thus formed are known as polymers. From a study of the\r\nclassification of the elements Mr. Mills is of opinion that the only\r\nknown polymers of the primitive matter are arsenic, antimony, and\r\nperhaps erbium and osmium.\r\n\r\n_Argument from the Periodic Law._—Lastly a scheme of the origin of the\r\nelements, suggested to Mr. Crookes by consideration of Professor\r\nReynolds’s method of illustrating the periodic law of Newlands, is\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out by Newlands that atomicity and other properties of\r\nsome of the chemical elements depend on the order in which their atomic\r\nweights succeeded one another; and when this law was extended by\r\nProfessor Mendelejeff to all elements it was apparent that a\r\nmathematical relation exists between the elements. This far-reaching law\r\nhas been fruitful of results. Referring to Professor Reynolds’s diagram\r\nillustrating the law, Mr. Crookes says: “The more I study the\r\narrangement of this zigzag curve, the more I am convinced that he who\r\ngrasps the key will be permitted to unlock some of the deepest mysteries\r\nof creation. Let us imagine if it is possible to get a glimpse of a few\r\nof the secrets here hidden. Let us picture the very beginnings of time,\r\nbefore geological ages, before the earth was thrown off from the central\r\nnucleus of molten fluid, before even the sun himself had consolidated\r\nfrom the original _protyle_.[74] Let us still imagine that at this\r\nprimal stage all was in an ultra-gaseous state, at a temperature\r\ninconceivably hotter than anything now existing in the visible universe;\r\nso high, indeed, that the chemical atoms could not yet have been formed,\r\nbeing still far above their dissociation-point. In so far as _protyle_\r\nis capable of radiating or reflecting light, this vast sea of\r\nincandescent mist, to an astronomer in a distant star, might have\r\nappeared as a nebula, showing in the spectroscope a few isolated lines,\r\nforecasts of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen spectra.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: _Protyle_ is the term adopted by Mr. Crookes to designate\r\nthe original primal matter existing before the evolution of the chemical\r\nelements, and out of which they were evolved. Protyle in chemistry is\r\nanalogous to _protoplasm_ in biology, with this difference, however,\r\nthat protyle is as yet hypothetical, whereas protoplasm is known to be\r\nreal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“But in course of time some process akin to cooling, probably internal,\r\nreduces the temperature of the cosmic _protyle_ to a point at which the\r\nfirst step in granulation takes place; matter as we know it comes into\r\nexistence, and atoms are formed. As soon as an atom is formed out of\r\n_protyle_ it is a store of energy, potential (from its tendency to\r\ncoalesce with other atoms by gravitation or chemically) and kinetic\r\n(from its internal motions). To obtain this energy, the neighbouring\r\n_protyle_ must be refrigerated by it, and thereby the subsequent\r\nformation of other atoms will be accelerated. But with atomic matter the\r\nvarious forms of energy which require matter to render them evident\r\nbegin to act; and, amongst others, that form of energy which has for one\r\nof its factors what we now call _atomic weight_. Let us assume that the\r\nelementary _protyle_ contains within itself the potentiality of every\r\npossible combining proportion or atomic weight. Let it be granted that\r\nthe whole of our known elements were not at this epoch simultaneously\r\ncreated. The easiest formed element, the one most nearly allied to the\r\n_protyle_ in simplicity, is first born. Hydrogen—or shall we say\r\nhelium?—of all the known elements the one of simplest structure and\r\nlowest atomic weight, is the first to come into being. For some time\r\nhydrogen would be the only form of matter (as we know it) in existence,\r\nand between hydrogen and the next formed element there would be a\r\nconsiderable gap in time, during the latter part of which the element\r\nnext in order of simplicity would be slowly approaching its birth-point:\r\npending this period we may suppose that the evolutionary process, which\r\nsoon was to determine the birth of a new element, would also determine\r\nits atomic weight, its affinities, and its chemical position.”\r\n\r\n_Professor F. W. Clarke on the pre-nebular condition of matter._—Views\r\non elemental evolution almost similar to those of Mr. Crookes’s have\r\nbeen advocated by Professor Clarke. Spectroscopic phenomena, says\r\nProfessor Clarke, are quite in harmony with the idea that all matter is\r\nat bottom one, our supposed atoms being really various aggregations of\r\nthe same fundamental unit.\r\n\r\n“Everybody knows that the nebular hypothesis, as it is to-day, draws its\r\nstrongest support from spectroscopic facts. There shine the nebulæ in\r\nthe heavens, and the spectroscope tells us what they really are, namely,\r\nvast clouds of incandescent gas, mainly, if not entirely, hydrogen and\r\nnitrogen. If we attempt to trace the chain of evolution through which\r\nour planet is supposed to have grown, we shall find the sky is full of\r\nintermediate forms. The nebulæ themselves appear to be in various stages\r\nof development; the fixed stars or suns differ widely in chemical\r\nconstitution and in temperature; our earth is most complex of all. There\r\nare no ‘missing links’ such as the zoologist longs to discover when he\r\ntries to explain the origin of species. First, we have a nebula\r\ncontaining little more than hydrogen, then a very hot star with calcium,\r\nmagnesium, and one or two other metals added; next comes a cooler sun in\r\nwhich free hydrogen is missing, but whose chemical complexity is much\r\nincreased; at last we reach the true planets with their multitudes of\r\nmaterial forms. Could there well be a more straightforward story? Could\r\nthe unity of creation receive a much more ringing emphasis? We see the\r\nevolution of planets from nebulæ still going on, and parallel with it an\r\nevolution of higher from lower kinds of matter.\r\n\r\n“Just here, perhaps, is the key to the whole subject. If the elements\r\nare all in essence one, how could their many forms originate save by a\r\nprocess of evolution upward? How could their numerous relations with\r\neach other, and their regular serial arrangements into groups, be better\r\nexplained? In this, as in other problems, the hypothesis of evolution is\r\nthe simplest, most natural, and best in accordance with facts.”[75]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _Popular Science Monthly_ for February 1876. See also the\r\nJanuary number for 1873.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney on the pre-nebular condition of\r\nmatter._—Further evidence that all the chemical elements were probably\r\nevolved from one common source, is furnished by Dr. G. Johnstone\r\nStoney’s “Logarithmic Law of Atomic Weights,” a theory recently advanced\r\nin a communication to the Royal Society.[76] A cardinal feature of this\r\ninvestigation is that in it atomic weights are represented by volumes,\r\nnot by lines. A succession of spheres are taken whose volumes are\r\nproportional to the atomic weights, and which may be called _the atomic\r\nspheres_. When the radii of these spheres are plotted down on a diagram\r\nas ordinates, and a series of integers as abscissas, the general form of\r\nthe logarithmic curve becomes apparent; and close scrutiny has shown\r\nthat either the logarithmic curve, or some curve lying very close to it,\r\nexpresses the real law of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Proc. Roy. Soc._ for April 19, 1888, p. 115.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, as seems probable, the logarithmic law is the law of nature, there\r\nappear to be three elements lighter than hydrogen, which Dr. Stoney has\r\ntermed infra-fluorine, infra-oxygen, and infra-nitrogen. And there are,\r\nat all events, six missing elements between hydrogen and lithium.\r\n\r\nDr. Stoney’s investigation is based on the fact that if the atomic\r\nweights of the chemical elements be arranged in order of magnitude,\r\nperiodic laws come to light, viz.: those discovered by Newlands,\r\nMendelejeff, and Meyer. From this it follows that there must be some law\r\nconnecting the atomic weights with the successive terms of a numerical\r\nseries—either alone or along with other variables.\r\n\r\n“This law,” says Dr. Stoney, “may be obtained in one of its graphical\r\nforms by plotting down a series of integers as abscissas, and the\r\nsuccessive atomic weights as ordinates. In this way it furnishes a\r\ndiagram which has somewhat the shape of a hurling-stick, consisting of a\r\nshort curved portion succeeded by a long and nearly straight portion.\r\nBut as this diagram cannot be directly identified with any known curve,\r\nit does not suffice for the determination of the law.\r\n\r\n“The diagram, however, assumes a form which can be interpreted when we\r\nuse the cube roots of the atomic weights for its ordinates, instead of\r\nthe atomic weights themselves. This is equivalent to taking volumes\r\ninstead of lines to represent the atomic weights. When this is done, the\r\nends of the ordinates are found to lie near a regular and gradual curve,\r\nfrom which they deviate to the right and left by displacements that are\r\nsmall and appear to follow periodic laws which have been in part traced.\r\nThe central curve is found on examination to be either a logarithmic\r\ncurve or some curve lying exceedingly close to it. If the curve be in\r\nreality the logarithmic curve, it furnishes us the law that:\r\n\r\n“The cube root of the n^{th} atomic weight = κ log (n q) + a small\r\nperiodic correction; where κ and q are constants, the values of which\r\nare furnished by the observations.\r\n\r\n“Either this logarithmic law, or a law that lies exceedingly close to\r\nit, must be the law of nature.”\r\n\r\nReferring to this theory, Professor Reynolds says: “It certainly\r\nintroduced points of extraordinary importance, though perhaps at present\r\nthey could not all quite realise its fullest import. There were several\r\npoints of some little difficulty to be grappled with, but it clearly\r\npointed to the conclusion that we were fast approaching the time when\r\nphysicists—both chemical and physicists proper—are combining to evolve\r\nout of the scientific work lying on the borderland most important and\r\nstartling facts.”\r\n\r\nThe bearing which Dr. Stoney’s conclusions, like those of Mr. Crookes,\r\nhave on the primitive condition of the material universe is obvious.\r\n\r\nDr. Stoney, like Mr. Crookes, considers that the chemical elements are\r\nsubject to decay. That they are not only generated but destroyed—that\r\nthey are subject not only to evolution but dissolution. He believes that\r\nthe generative process probably takes place only at, or beyond, the\r\nconfines of the universe, and the destructive process at the centres of\r\novergrown stars, which is the position of lowest potential. Dr. Stoney\r\nthinks that this extinction of the chemical elements in the centre of a\r\nstar is a cause which limits its size and prevents its overgrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPACT THEORY IN RELATION TO THE FOREGOING THEORIES OF THE\r\n    PRE-NEBULAR CONDITION OF MATTER.\r\n\r\nIn all these theories, as has already been observed, the primitive\r\ncondition of the universe was that of matter in a state of extreme\r\ntenuity, while by aggregation the materials became successively larger\r\nand larger until they assumed the magnitude of suns and planets. For\r\nexample, according to the meteoric theory, meteorites are formed out of\r\n“cosmical dust,” “fire-mist,” or condensed vapour, and then suns and\r\nplanets are formed by aggregation from these meteorites. Facts seem,\r\nhowever, to point to the very reverse as being the true course of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nMeteorites are undoubtedly the fragments of larger masses. It looks more\r\nlikely that they are, as has already been stated, fragments of stellar\r\nmasses which have been shattered to pieces by collision, and that this\r\n“cosmical dust,” from which the meteorites are alleged to have been\r\nformed, are simply the dust arising out of the destruction of the\r\nmasses. After the two bodies had collided and been shattered to pieces,\r\nsome of the fragments would undoubtedly be projected with a velocity\r\nthat would carry them beyond the attractive power of the general mass,\r\nand thus they would escape being volatilised. These fragments would\r\ncontinue their wanderings through space as meteorites.\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that the number, as well as the importance, of these\r\nwanderers has been greatly over-estimated. Mr. Lockyer states that Dr.\r\nSchmidt, of Athens, found that the mean hourly number of luminous\r\nmeteors visible on a clear moonless night by one observer was fourteen.\r\nCertainly no such quantity is visible in this country. In Scotland, at\r\nleast, one may often watch night after night under the most favourable\r\nconditions without having the good fortune to see a single meteor.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, true that the immediately prior condition of a sun or\r\na planet was that of matter in an extremely attenuated or dissociated\r\nstate. This is essential to the nebular, as well as to the meteoric,\r\nhypothesis. But it is not with the immediately prior condition that we\r\nare at present concerned, but with the primitive, or pre-nebular,\r\ncondition. Take, for example, the case of the solar nebula, out of which\r\nour sun and planets were formed. Was this nebulous mass formed from\r\nmatter in a state of extreme tenuity, scattered through space and\r\ncollected together by gravity? Or did it result from two solid globes\r\nshattered to pieces by collision, which were then converted into the\r\nnebulous condition by the heat generated from the collision? It is no\r\ndoubt true that the analogies of nature would, at first sight, be apt to\r\nlead us to the conclusion that the former theory was the more likely of\r\nthe two, as the larger is generally made by aggregation from the\r\nsmaller. But a little consideration will show that, in the present case,\r\nthe weight of this analogy is more apparent than real. The impact theory\r\ndoes not rest upon a purely hypothetical basis. The cause to which it\r\nappeals has a real existence. The point of uncertainty is whether the\r\ncause actually produces the effect which is attributed to it. We know\r\nfrom observation that there are stellar masses, some of them probably\r\nlarger than our sun, moving through space with enormous velocities in\r\nall directions.[77] According to the ordinary laws of chance, collision\r\nat times would be an inevitable result, and when such an event did take\r\nplace the destruction of the colliding bodies, and their consequent\r\ntransformation into a nebulous mass, would, at least in many cases, be a\r\n_necessary_ result. In fact, we have, in the case of these vast stellar\r\nmasses, what we know occurs among the invisible molecules of a gas. So\r\nfar as mere analogy is concerned, the impact theory is just about as\r\nprobable as the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: The dark stellar masses which escape observation may be as\r\nnumerous as those that are visible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated it would follow that in most cases the stellar\r\nmasses have been formed out of the destruction of pre-existing masses,\r\nlike the geological formations out of the destruction of prior\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n_The theories do not account for the motion of the stars._—According to\r\nall the foregoing theories aggregation and condensation are produced by\r\ngravity. The materials dispersed throughout space are drawn together by\r\ntheir mutual attraction, and aggregated round a centre of gravity.\r\nGravitation, although it imparts motion to the materials, can impart no\r\nmotion of translation to the mass itself. Gravitation cannot, therefore,\r\nbe the cause of the motion of translation of the mass. The stars are not\r\nsupposed to be gravitating towards, or around, a great centre of\r\nattraction, for they are found moving in straight lines in all\r\ndirections, which could not be the case if gravity were the cause of\r\ntheir motion. To what cause is their motion, therefore, to be\r\nattributed? A meteorite or other small body might be ejected from any\r\nsystem, by the explosive force of heat or some other cause, with a\r\nvelocity which might carry it into boundless space; but such could not\r\nbe the case in regard to a body of the magnitude of a star. No one for a\r\nmoment could suppose that 1830 Groombridge, for example, moving at the\r\nrate of 200 miles a second, is an eject from any system.\r\n\r\nAccording to the impact theory the whole is plain; for this 200 miles\r\nper second is simply a part of the untransformed motion of translation\r\nwhich the materials composing the star had from the beginning. In other\r\nwords, the matter and the motion were eternal, or, what is more\r\nprobable, as will afterwards be seen, co-existed from creation—not,\r\nhowever, as molecular motion, but as motion of the mass.\r\n\r\n_The theories do not account for the amount of heat required._—It has\r\nbeen shown that, although the materials of our solar system had fallen\r\ntogether from an infinite distance, it could not have generated heat\r\nsufficient to have formed a gaseous nebula extending to the distance of\r\nthe planet Neptune. Gravitation alone could not, therefore, have been\r\nthe source from which the nebula obtained its heat. The solar nebula,\r\nhowever, must originally have extended far beyond the orbit of Neptune.\r\n\r\nBut supposing it could be demonstrated that the heat thus generated was\r\nsufficient to have formed a nebula extending to even twice the distance\r\nof Neptune, this would not remove the fatal objection to the gravitation\r\ntheory of the origin of the solar nebula. For the facts, both of geology\r\nand of biology, equally show that the sun has been radiating his heat at\r\nthe present rate for more than twice the length of time that it could\r\npossibly have done had gravitation been the source from which the energy\r\nwas derived. This objection is alike fatal to the meteoric theory as it\r\nis to all other theories which attribute the origin and source of the\r\nheat to gravitation.\r\n\r\n_Evolution of matter._—Our inquiries into stellar evolution do not,\r\nhowever, begin with the consideration of a gaseous nebula, or with\r\nswarms of meteorites. There was a pre-nebular evolution. The researches\r\nof Prout, Newlands, Mendelejeff, Meyer, Dumas, Clarke, Lockyer, Crookes,\r\nBrodie, Hunt, Graham, Deville, Berthelot, Stoney, Reynolds, Carnelley,\r\nMills, and others, clearly show, I think, that the very matter forming\r\nthis nebulous mass passed through a long anterior process of evolution.\r\nAnd not only the matter, but the very elements themselves constituting\r\nthe matter, were evolved out of some prior condition of substance.\r\n\r\nI have already given at some length the views which have been advanced\r\nby several of our leading physicists and chemists on the evolution of\r\nthe chemical elements, and on some of the bearings which these views\r\nhave on stellar evolution. I shall now briefly refer to a point on which\r\nI venture to think the theory discussed in this volume seems to cast\r\nsome additional light.\r\n\r\nIf the elements were evolved out of a common source, there is, in order\r\nto this, one necessary condition, viz. an excessively high temperature;\r\nfor the temperature must be above the point of the dissociation of all\r\nthe chemical elements. “In the primal stage of the universe,” says Mr.\r\nCrookes, “before matter, as we now find it, was formed from the protyle,\r\nall was in an ultra-gaseous state, at a temperature inconceivably hotter\r\nthan anything now existing in the visible universe; so high, indeed,\r\nthat the chemical atoms could not yet have been formed, being still far\r\nabove their dissociation point.”\r\n\r\nWhat, then, produced this excessive temperature in this supposed\r\nultra-gaseous protyle? It could not have resulted from condensation by\r\ngravity. In condensation the heat increases as the condensation\r\nproceeds, because it is the condensation which produces the heat. But\r\nhere the reverse must have been the case, for the ultra-gaseous mass was\r\nmuch hotter than the sun which was afterwards formed out of it. It was,\r\naccording to Mr. Crookes, when this gaseous mass cooled down, so as to\r\npermit of its becoming converted into solid matter, that condensation\r\ninto a sun could take place. Besides, was it not the excessive heat\r\nwhich produced the assumed ultra-gaseous condition?\r\n\r\nThere is another difficulty besetting the theory that the primitive heat\r\nwas derived from condensation by gravitation. Supposing we should assume\r\nit possible that the protyle could exist in this ultra-gaseous state\r\nwithout possessing temperature, and that it obtained its heat from\r\ncondensation by gravity, then the fact of condensation taking place\r\nshows that the gas was not in a state of equilibrium. But the gas could\r\nnot have remained stationary for a single moment without beginning to\r\ncondense while in a condition of unstable equilibrium. We must therefore\r\nconclude that the gas must have been in some other condition than the\r\ngaseous state prior to condensation.\r\n\r\nThe impact theory seems to remove all these difficulties. It is just as\r\nlikely _à priori_, if not more so, that the primitive form of the\r\nprotyle should have been that of large cold masses moving through space\r\nin all directions, with excessive velocities, as that it should have\r\nbeen that of a gaseous mass in a state of unstable equilibrium. If we\r\nassume the former condition, then the colliding of these masses would\r\naccount not only for the ultra-gaseous state, but also for its\r\ninconceivably high temperature. Besides, in this case we are not called\r\nupon to account for any other antecedent state of the masses before\r\ncollision, for they may have existed from the beginning of creation in\r\nthe form of masses in motion through space.\r\n\r\nHad space and time permitted, it might have been shown that there are\r\nother obscure points on which the theory seems to shed additional light.\r\nI shall now, in conclusion, refer to a point wherein the theory differs\r\nradically from that of all other theories of stellar evolution. But\r\nbefore doing so I may briefly refer to an objection which has been\r\nfrequently urged against the theory.\r\n\r\n_Objection considered._—The objection to which I refer is this, that,\r\nhad the nebulæ been produced by impact in the way implied in the theory,\r\nthen we ought to have had some historical record of such an event. I can\r\nperceive no force in such an objection. Our historical records, I\r\npresume, do not extend much farther back than about 3,000 years, and we\r\nhave no evidence to conclude that a new nebula makes its appearance in\r\nthe visible firmament with such frequency; and supposing it did, we have\r\nno grounds for assuming that its production by impact in the way\r\nsupposed by the theory would attract general notice. It is doubtful if\r\nthe nebula produced would, in the first instance, be actually visible. I\r\nhave shown that the temperature of the nebula could not have been less\r\nthan about 300,000,000° C., and it is very doubtful if the gaseous mass\r\nenveloping all that was solid in the nebula would, at such a\r\ntemperature, be self-luminous. The probability is that all the chemical\r\nelements composing it would be in a state of utter dissociation, and\r\nconverted back into the original protyle from which they were derived,\r\nagain to be slowly reconverted into their former atomic condition as the\r\ntemperature fell.\r\n\r\n_Can we on scientific grounds trace back the evolution of the universe\r\nto an absolute first condition?_—As has been repeatedly stated, all\r\ninquiries into the evolutionary history of the stellar universe begin in\r\nthe middle of a process. Evolution is a process. The changes that now\r\noccur arose out of preceding changes, and these, preceding changes out\r\nof changes still prior, and so on indefinitely back into the unknown\r\npast. This chain of causation—this succession of change—of consequent\r\nand antecedent—could not in this manner have extended back to infinity,\r\nor else the present stage of the universe’s evolution ought to have been\r\nreached infinite ages ago. The evolution of things must therefore have\r\nhad a beginning in time. Professor Winchell, in his final generalisation\r\nto his work, “World Life,” has stated this matter so clearly and\r\nforcibly that I cannot do better than here quote his words on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“We have not,” says Professor Winchell, “the slightest scientific\r\ngrounds for assuming that matter existed in a certain condition from all\r\neternity, and only began undergoing its changes a few millions or\r\nbillions of years ago. The essential activity of the powers ascribed to\r\nit forbids the thought. For all that we know—and, indeed, as the\r\n_conclusion_ from all that we know—primal matter began its progressive\r\nchanges on the morning of its existence. As, therefore, the series of\r\nchanges is demonstrably finite, the lifetime of matter itself is\r\nnecessarily finite. There is no real refuge from this conclusion; for,\r\nif we suppose the beginning of the present cycle to have been only a\r\nrestitution of an older order effected by the operations of natural\r\ncauses, and suppose—what science is unable to comprehend—that older\r\norder to be a similar re-inauguration, and so on indefinitely through\r\nthe past, we only postpone the predication of an absolute beginning,\r\nsince, by all the admissions of modern scientific philosophy, it is a\r\nnecessity of nature to run down.”\r\n\r\nThese are consequences which necessarily follow from every theory of\r\nstellar evolution which has hitherto been advanced. The impact theory,\r\nhowever, completely removes the difficulty, for according to it the\r\nevolutionary process can, on purely scientific grounds, be traced back\r\nto an absolute beginning in time. If huge solid masses moving through\r\nspace were the original condition of the universe, then, in so far as\r\neither philosophy or science can demonstrate to the contrary, it might\r\nhave been in this condition from all eternity. We are therefore not\r\ncalled upon to account for this primitive condition of things. Now it is\r\nevident, unless a collision should take place, the universe would remain\r\nin this condition for ever: without a collision there could be no\r\nchange, no work performed, and absolutely no loss or gain of energy, and\r\ntherefore no process of evolution. The first collision would be the\r\nabsolute commencement of evolution—the beginning of the process of the\r\ndevelopment of the universe. Evolution would, in this case, have its\r\nabsolute beginning in time, and consequently was not eternal. If, on the\r\nother hand, we assume, what is far more in harmony with physics,\r\nmetaphysics, and common sense, that the universe was created in time, we\r\nare still led to the same result as to an absolute commencement of\r\nevolution. In both cases we reach a point beyond which there can be no\r\nlegitimate inquiry; no further question which the scientists can\r\nreasonably ask.\r\n\r\nWe have no grounds to conclude that there is anything eternal, except\r\nGod, Time, and Space.

At first thought it would\r\nseem that facial expression is the most important of these outward signs\r\nof inner processes; but a little observation will convince one that the\r\nposture assumed by the body—the poise of the head and the position of\r\nthe hands—as well as the many alternations of color and of general\r\nnutrition, are just as striking evidences of the course of thought.

Cloth, $1.75.\r\n\r\n“A profound research into the laws of primitive nervous systems\r\nconducted by one of the ablest English investigators. Mr. Romanes set up\r\na tent on the beach and examined his beautiful pets for six summers in\r\nsuccession. Such patient and loving work has borne its fruits in a\r\nmonograph which leaves nothing to be said about jelly-fish, star-fish,\r\nand sea-urchins. Every one who has studied the lowest forms of life on\r\nthe sea-shore admires these objects. But few have any idea of the\r\nexquisite delicacy of their structure and their nice adaptation to their\r\nplace in nature. Mr. Romanes brings out the subtile beauties of the\r\nrudimentary organisms, and shows the resemblances they bear to the\r\nhigher types of creation.
