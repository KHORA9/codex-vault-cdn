S., Etc.,\r\n\r\n                PRESIDENT OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of last year, I sat down to write a few geological\r\nsketches for a newspaper; the accumulated facts of twenty years\r\ncrowded upon me as I wrote, and the few sketches have expanded into\r\na volume. Permit me, honored Sir, to dedicate this volume to you.\r\nIts imperfections are doubtless many, for it has been produced under\r\nmany disadvantages; but it is not the men best qualified to decide\r\nregarding it whose criticisms I fear most; and I am especially\r\ndesirous to bring it under your notice, as of all geologists the\r\nmost thoroughly acquainted with those ancient formations which it\r\nprofesses partially to describe. I am, besides, desirous it should\r\nbe known, and this, I trust, from other motives than those of\r\nvanity, that, when prosecuting my humble researches in obscurity and\r\nsolitude, the present President of the Geological Society did not\r\ndeem it beneath him to evince an interest in the results to which\r\nthey led, and to encourage and assist the inquirer with his advice.\r\nAccept, honored Sir, my sincere thanks for your kindness.\r\n\r\nSmith, the father of English Geology, loved to remark that he had\r\nbeen born upon the Oolite--the formation whose various deposits he\r\nwas the first to distinguish and describe, and from which, as from\r\nthe meridian line of the geographer, the geological scale has been\r\ngraduated on both sides. I have thought of the circumstance when,\r\non visiting in my native district the birthplace of the author of\r\nthe _Silurian System_, I found it situated among the more ancient\r\nfossiliferous rocks of the north of Scotland--the Lower Formation\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone spreading out beneath and around it, and\r\nthe first-formed deposit of the system, the Great Conglomerate,\r\nrising high on the neighboring hills. It is unquestionably no slight\r\nadvantage to be placed, at that early stage of life, when the mind\r\ncollects its facts with greatest avidity, and the curiosity is most\r\nactive, in localities where there is much to attract observation that\r\nhas escaped the notice of others. Like the gentleman whom I have now\r\nthe honor of addressing, I too was born on the Old Red Sandstone, and\r\nfirst broke ground as an inquirer into geological fact in a formation\r\nscarce at all known to the geologist, and in which there still\r\nremains much for future discoverers to examine and describe. Hence an\r\nacquaintance, I am afraid all too slight, with phenomena which, if\r\nintrinsically of interest, may be found to have also the interest of\r\nnovelty to recommend them, and with organisms which, though among the\r\nmost ancient of things in their relation to the world's history, will\r\nbe pronounced new by the geological reader in their relation to human\r\nknowledge. Hence, too, my present opportunity of subscribing myself,\r\nas the writer of a volume on the Old Red Sandstone,\r\n\r\n      Honored Sir,\r\n\r\n          With sincere gratitude and respect,\r\n\r\n              Your obedient humble Servant,\r\n\r\n                                     HUGH MILLER.\r\n\r\n  Edinburgh, _May_ 1, 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly one third of the present volume appeared a few months ago\r\nin the form of a series of sketches in the _Witness_ newspaper. A\r\nportion of the first chapter was submitted to the public a year or\r\ntwo earlier, in _Chambers's Edinburgh Journal_. The rest, amounting\r\nto about two thirds of the whole, appears for the first time.\r\n\r\nEvery such work has its defects. The faults of the present\r\nvolume--faults all too obvious, I am afraid--would have been\r\nprobably fewer had the writer enjoyed greater leisure. Some of them,\r\nhowever, seem scarce separable from the nature of the subject:\r\nthere are others for which, from their opposite character, I shall\r\nhave to apologize in turn to opposite classes of readers. My facts\r\nwould, in most instances, have lain closer had I written for\r\ngeologists exclusively, and there would have been less reference to\r\nfamiliar phenomena. And had I written for only general readers, my\r\ndescriptions of hitherto undescribed organisms, and the deposits of\r\nlittle-known localities, would have occupied fewer pages, and would\r\nhave been thrown off with, perhaps, less regard to minute detail than\r\nto pictorial effect. May I crave, while addressing myself, now to the\r\none class, and now to the other, the alternate forbearance of each?\r\n\r\nSuch is the state of progression in geological science, that the\r\ngeologist who stands still for but a very little, must be content\r\nto find himself left behind. Nay, so rapid is the progress, that\r\nscarce a geological work passes through the press in which some\r\nof the statements of the earlier pages have not to be modified,\r\nrestricted, or extended in the concluding ones. The present volume\r\nshares, in this respect, in what seems the common lot. In describing\r\nthe _Coccosteus_, the reader will find it stated that the creature,\r\nunlike its contemporary the _Pterichthys_, was unfurnished with\r\narms. Ere arriving at such a conclusion, I had carefully examined\r\nat least a hundred different _Coccostei_; but the positive evidence\r\nof one specimen outweighs the negative evidence of a hundred; and\r\nI have just learned from a friend in the north, (Mr. Patrick Duff,\r\nof Elgin,) that a Coccosteus lately found at Lethen-bar, and now in\r\nthe possession of Lady Gordon Gumming, of Altyre, is furnished with\r\nwhat seem uncouth, paddle-shaped arms, that project from the head.[A]\r\nAll that I have given of the creature, however, will be found true\r\nto the actual type; and that parts should have been omitted will\r\nsurprise no one who remembers that many hundred belemnites had\r\nbeen figured and described ere a specimen turned up in which the\r\nhorny prolongation, with its enclosed ink-bag, was found attached\r\nto the calcareous spindle; and that even yet, after many thousand\r\ntrilobites have been carefully examined, it remains a question with\r\nthe oryctologist, whether this crustacean of the earliest periods was\r\nfurnished with legs, or creeped on an abdominal foot, like the snail.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: As these paddle-shaped arms have not been introduced by\r\nAgassiz into his restoration of the _Coccosteus_, their existence, at\r\nleast as arms, must still be regarded as problematical. There can be\r\nno doubt, however, that they existed as plates of very peculiar form,\r\nand greatly resembling paddles, and that they served in the economy\r\nof the animal some still unaccounted for purpose.]\r\n\r\nI owe to the kindness of Mr. Robertson, Inverugie, the specimen\r\nfigured in Plate V., fig. 7, containing shells of the only species\r\nyet discovered in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland. They occur in\r\nthe Lower Formation of the system, in a quarry near Kirkwald, in\r\nwhich the specimen figured, with several others of the same kind,\r\nwas found by Mr. Robertson, in the year 1834. In referring to this\r\nshell, page 99,[B] I have spoken of it as a delicate bivalve, much\r\nresembling a Venus; drawing my illustration, naturally enough, when\r\ndescribing the shell of an ocean deposit, rather from among marine,\r\nthan fluviatile testacea. I have since submitted it to Mr. Murchison,\r\nwho has obligingly written me that he \"can find no one to say more\r\nregarding it than that it is very like a _Cyclas_.\" He adds,\r\nhowever, that it must be an ocean production notwithstanding, seeing\r\nthat all its contemporaries in England, Scotland, and Russia, whether\r\nshells or fish, are unequivocally marine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Page 90 of the present edition.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of two of the figures in Plate IX., the figures\r\nof the _Cephalaspis_ and the _Holoptychius_, and one of the sections\r\nin the Frontispiece, section 2, all the prints of the volume are\r\noriginals. To Mr. Daniel Alexander, of Edinburgh,--a gentleman,\r\nwho to the skill and taste of the superior artist, adds no small\r\nportion of the knowledge of the practical geologist,--I am indebted\r\nfor several of the drawings; that of fig. 2 in Plate V., fig. 1 in\r\nPlate VI., fig. 2 in Plate VIII., and figs. 3 and 4 in plate IX. I am\r\nindebted to another friend for fig. 1, in Plate VII. Whatever defects\r\nmay be discovered in any of the others, must be attributed to the\r\nuntaught efforts of the writer, all unfamiliar, hitherto, with the\r\npencil, and with by much too little leisure to acquaint himself with\r\nit now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN PUBLISHERS' NOTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publishers take pleasure in presenting to the American reader\r\nthis interesting work of Hugh Miller, in which are restored to our\r\nview some of the phenomena which occurred in the earlier formations\r\nof the crust of the earth, belonging to those inconceivably remote\r\nages when living things first appeared;--a work so scientific, and\r\nyet so illustrated with familiar objects and scenes, as to be well\r\nunderstood by those little versed in Geology. The grand conclusions\r\nwhich the author deduces from apparently trifling circumstances that\r\nevery one has noticed a hundred times, without being the wiser,\r\nillustrate the difference between the philosopher and the common\r\nobserver; and the simple and pictorial style in which they are\r\ndelineated renders the work peculiarly fascinating.\r\n\r\nThis is a reprint of the fourth English edition, without additions\r\nor alterations, excepting the omission of the prefatory Notes to\r\nthe second and third editions. In the first of these, the author\r\nstates that he had added about fifteen pages to the first edition,\r\nchiefly relating to that middle formation of the system to which\r\nthe organisms of Balruddery and Carmylie belong, the representative\r\nof the Cornstones in England. Some matters there given as merely\r\nconjectural were also replaced by ascertained facts. In the\r\nlatter, he announces that the somewhat bold prediction made by him\r\nin the first edition, in 1841, that the ichthyolites of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone would be found at least equal to those of all the\r\ngeological formations united, at the death of Cuvier, was already\r\nmore than fulfilled. Cuvier enumerated ninety-two species of fossil\r\nfishes; Agassiz, in 1846, enumerated one hundred and five in the Old\r\nRed Sandstone alone, a formation which had been regarded as poorer\r\nin organisms than any other. In this edition was given the list\r\nof species, as determined and arranged by Professor Agassiz. Many\r\nadditions in the shape of notes were also made.\r\n\r\nIn the first two editions it was stated that there was a gradual\r\nincrease of size observable in the progress of ichthyolic life, and\r\nthat the Old Red System exhibited, in its successive formations, this\r\ngradation of bulk, beginning with an age of dwarfs, and ending with\r\nan age of giants. Since then, it has been ascertained that there\r\nwere giants among the dwarfs. The remains of one of the largest fish\r\nfound any where, has been discovered in its lowest formation; whereby\r\nhe was convinced that the theory of a gradual progression in size,\r\nfrom the earlier to the later Palæozoic formations, though based\r\noriginally on no inconsiderable amount of negative evidence, must be\r\npermitted to drop. On this fact he has based his incontrovertible\r\nargument against the \"development theory\" in his more recent work,\r\nalready given to the American Public, \"Foot-Prints of the Creator.\"\r\n\r\nBoston, _January_, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  PAGE\r\n\r\n  The Working-man's true Policy.--His only Mode of acquiring\r\n    Power.--The

These four beds compose a lower formation\r\nof the system, more strikingly marked by its peculiar organisms\r\nthan even the other two. (See Chapters II. III. IV. and V.) In the\r\nsection this lower formation is represented as we find it developed\r\nin Caithness and Orkney. In fig. 5 it is represented as developed\r\nin Cromarty, where, though the fossils are identical with those of\r\nthe more northern localities, at least one of the deposits, _f_, is\r\nmineralogically different--alternating beds of sandstone and clay,\r\nthese last enclosing limestone nodules, taking the place of the\r\nbituminous schists.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nThe Old Red System of England and Wales, as given in the general\r\nSection of Mr. Murchison, with the Silurian Rocks beneath and the\r\ncarboniferous limestone above. _i._ The point in the geological\r\nscale at which vertebrated existences first appear. The three\r\nOld Red Sandstone formations of this section correspond in their\r\ncharacteristic fossils with those of Scotland, but the proportions\r\nin which they are developed are widely different. The tilestones\r\nseem a comparatively narrow stripe in the system in England; the\r\nanswering formation in Scotland, _e, f, g, h_, is of such enormous\r\nthickness, that it has been held by very superior geologists to\r\ncontain three distinct formations--_e_, the New Red Sandstone, _f_,\r\na representative of the Coal Measures, and _g, h_, the Old Red\r\nSandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nInteresting case of extensive denudation from existing causes on\r\nthe northern shore of the Moray Frith.

Do not seek happiness in what is misnamed pleasure; seek\r\nit rather in what is termed study. Keep your consciences clear, your\r\ncuriosity fresh, and embrace every opportunity of cultivating your\r\nminds. You will gain nothing by attending Chartist meetings. The\r\nfellows who speak nonsense with fluency at these assemblies, and deem\r\ntheir nonsense eloquence, are totally unable to help either you or\r\nthemselves; or, if they do succeed in helping themselves, it will\r\nbe all at your expense. Leave them to harangue unheeded, and set\r\nyourselves to occupy your leisure hours in making yourselves wiser\r\nmen. Learn to make a right use of your eyes: the commonest things\r\nare worth looking at--even stones and weeds, and the most familiar\r\nanimals. Head good books, not forgetting the best of all: there\r\nis more true philosophy in the Bible than in every work of every\r\nsceptic that ever wrote; and we would be all miserable creatures\r\nwithout it, and none more miserable than you. You are jealous of the\r\nupper classes; and perhaps it is too true that, with some good, you\r\nhave received much evil at their hands. It must be confessed they\r\nhave hitherto been doing comparatively little for you, and a great\r\ndeal for themselves. But upper and lower classes there must be, so\r\nlong as the world lasts; and there is only one way in which your\r\njealousy of them can be well directed. Do not let them get ahead of\r\nyou in intelligence. It would be alike unwise and unjust to attempt\r\ncasting them down to your own level, and no class would suffer more\r\nin the attempt than yourselves; for you would only be clearing the\r\nway, at an immense expense of blood, and under a tremendous pressure\r\nof misery, for another and perhaps worse aristocracy, with some\r\nsecond Cromwell or Napoleon at their head. Society, however, is in\r\na state of continual flux: some in the upper classes are from time\r\nto time going down, and some of you from time to time mounting up\r\nto take their places--always the more steady and intelligent among\r\nyou, remember; and if all your minds were cultivated, not merely\r\nintellectually, but morally also, you would find yourselves, as a\r\nbody, in the possession of a power which every charter in the world\r\ncould not confer upon you, and which all the tyranny or injustice of\r\nthe world could not withstand.\r\n\r\nI intended, however, to speak rather of the pleasure to be derived,\r\nby even the humblest, in the pursuit of knowledge, than of the power\r\nwith which knowledge in the masses is invariably accompanied. For it\r\nis surely of greater importance that men should receive accessions\r\nto their own happiness, than to the influence which they exert over\r\nother men. There is none of the intellectual, and none of the moral\r\nfaculties, the exercise of which does not lead to enjoyment; nay,\r\nit is chiefly in the active employment of these that all enjoyment\r\nconsists; and hence it is that happiness bears so little reference\r\nto station. It is a truth which has been often told, but very little\r\nheeded or little calculated upon, that though one nobleman may be\r\nhappier than another, and one laborer happier than another, yet it\r\ncannot be at all premised of their respective orders, that the one is\r\nin any degree happier than the other. Simple as the fact may seem,\r\nif universally recognized, it would save a great deal of useless\r\ndiscontent, and a great deal of envy. Will my humbler readers permit\r\nme at once to illustrate this subject, and to introduce the chapters\r\nwhich follow, by a piece of simple narrative? I wish to show them\r\nhow possible it is to enjoy much happiness in very mean employments.\r\nCowper tells us that labor, though the primal curse, \"has been\r\nsoftened into mercy;\" and I think that, even had he not done so, I\r\nwould have found out the fact for myself.\r\n\r\nIt was twenty years, last February, since I set out a little\r\nbefore sunrise to make my first acquaintance with a life of labor\r\nand restraint, and I have rarely had a heavier heart than on that\r\nmorning. I was but a slim, loose-jointed boy at the time--fond of\r\nthe pretty intangibilities of romance, and of dreaming when broad\r\nawake; and, woeful change! I was now going to work at what Burns\r\nhas instanced in his \"Twa Dogs\" as one of the most disagreeable of\r\nall employments--to work in a quarry. Bating the passing uneasiness\r\noccasioned by a few gloomy anticipations, the portion of my life\r\nwhich had already gone by had been happy beyond the common lot. I had\r\nbeen a wanderer among rocks and woods--a reader of curious books when\r\nI could get them--a gleaner of old traditionary stories; and now I\r\nwas going to exchange all my day-dreams, and all my amusements, for\r\nthe kind of life in which men toil every day that they may be enabled\r\nto eat, and eat every day that they may be enabled to toil!\r\n\r\nThe quarry in which I wrought lay on the southern shore of a noble\r\ninland bay, or frith, rather, with a little clear stream on the\r\none side, and a thick fir wood on the other. It had been opened\r\nin the Old Red Sandstone of the district, and was overtopped by a\r\nhuge bank of diluvial clay, which rose over it in some places to\r\nthe height of nearly thirty feet, and which at this time was rent\r\nand shivered, wherever it presented an open front to the weather,\r\nby a recent frost. A heap of loose fragments, which had fallen from\r\nabove, blocked up the face of the quarry, and my first employment\r\nwas to clear them away. The friction of the shovel soon blistered\r\nmy hands; but the pain was by no means very severe, and I wrought\r\nhard and willingly, that I might see how the huge strata below,\r\nwhich presented so firm and unbroken a frontage, were to be torn\r\nup and removed. Picks, and wedges, and levers were applied by my\r\nbrother-workmen; and simple and rude as I had been accustomed to\r\nregard these implements, I found I had much to learn in the way of\r\nusing them. They all proved inefficient, however; and the workmen had\r\nto bore into one of the inferior strata, and employ gunpowder. The\r\nprocess was new to me, and I deemed it a highly amusing one: it had\r\nthe merit, too, of being attended with some such degree of danger as\r\na boating or rock excursion, and had thus an interest independent of\r\nits novelty. We had a few capital shots: the fragments flew in every\r\ndirection; and an immense mass of the diluvium came toppling down,\r\nbearing with it two dead birds, that in a recent storm had crept\r\ninto one of the deeper fissures, to die in the shelter. I felt a new\r\ninterest in examining them. The one was a pretty cock goldfinch, with\r\nits hood of vermilion, and its wings inlaid with the gold to which it\r\nowes its name, as unsoiled and smooth as if it had been preserved for\r\na museum. The other, a somewhat rarer bird, of the woodpecker tribe,\r\nwas variegated with light blue and a grayish yellow. I was engaged\r\nin admiring the poor little things, more disposed to be sentimental,\r\nperhaps, than if I had been ten years older, and thinking of the\r\ncontrast between the warmth and jollity of their green summer haunts,\r\nand the cold and darkness of their last retreat, when I heard our\r\nemployer bidding the workmen lay by their tools. I looked up, and saw\r\nthe sun sinking behind the thick fir wood beside us, and the long,\r\ndark shadows of the trees stretching downwards towards the shore.\r\n\r\nThis was no very formidable beginning of the course of life I had so\r\nmuch dreaded. To be sure, my hands were a little sore, and I felt\r\nnearly as much fatigued as if I had been climbing among the rocks;\r\nbut I had wrought and been useful, and had yet enjoyed the day fully\r\nas much as usual. It was no small matter, too, that the evening,\r\nconverted, by a rare transmutation, into the delicious \"blink of\r\nrest\" which Burns so truthfully describes, was all my own. I was\r\nas light of heart next morning as any of my brother-workmen. There\r\nhad been a smart frost during the night, and the rime lay white on\r\nthe grass as we passed onwards through the fields; but the sun\r\nrose in a clear atmosphere, and the day mellowed, as it advanced,\r\ninto one of those delightful days of early spring, which give so\r\npleasing an earnest of whatever is mild and genial in the better\r\nhalf of the year. All the workmen rested at midday, and I went to\r\nenjoy my half-hour alone on a mossy knoll in the neighboring wood,\r\nwhich commands through the trees a wide prospect of the bay and the\r\nopposite shore. There was not a wrinkle on the water, nor a cloud in\r\nthe sky, and the branches were as moveless in the calm as if they\r\nhad been traced on canvas. From a wooded promontory that stretched\r\nhalf way across the frith, there ascended a thin column of smoke.\r\nIt rose straight as the line of a plummet for more than a thousand\r\nyards, and then, on reaching a thinner stratum of air, spread out\r\nequally on every side, like the foliage of a stately tree. Ben Nevis\r\nrose to the west, white with the yet unwasted snows of winter, and\r\nas sharply defined in the clear atmosphere, as if all its sunny\r\nslopes and blue retiring hollows had been chiselled in marble. A\r\nline of snow ran along the opposite hills; all above was white, and\r\nall below was purple. They reminded me of the pretty French story,\r\nin which an old artist is described as tasking the ingenuity of his\r\nfuture son-in-law, by giving him, as a subject for his pencil, a\r\nflower-piece composed of only white flowers, of which the one half\r\nwere to bear their proper color, the other half a deep purple hue,\r\nand yet all be perfectly natural; and how the young man resolved the\r\nriddle, and gained his mistress, by introducing a transparent purple\r\nvase into the picture, and making the light pass through it on the\r\nflowers that were drooping over the edge. I returned to the quarry,\r\nconvinced that a very exquisite pleasure may be a very cheap one, and\r\nthat the busiest employments may afford leisure enough to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe gunpowder had loosened a large mass in one of the inferior\r\nstrata, and our first employment, on resuming our labors, was to\r\nraise it from its bed. I assisted the other workmen in placing it\r\non edge, and was much struck by the appearance of the platform on\r\nwhich it had rested. The entire surface was ridged and furrowed like\r\na bank of sand that had been left by the tide an hour before. I\r\ncould trace every bend and curvature, every cross hollow and counter\r\nridge of the corresponding phenomena; for the resemblance was no\r\nhalf resemblance--it was the thing itself; and I had observed it\r\na hundred and a hundred times, when sailing my little schooner in\r\nthe shallows left by the ebb. But what had become of the waves that\r\nhad thus fretted the solid rock, or of what element had they been\r\ncomposed? I felt as completely at fault as Robinson Crusoe did on\r\nhis discovering the print of the man's foot on the sand. The evening\r\nfurnished me with still further cause of wonder. We raised another\r\nblock in a different part of the quarry, and found that the area of\r\na circular depression in the stratum below was broken and flawed in\r\nevery direction, as if it had been the bottom of a pool recently\r\ndried up, which had shrunk and split in the hardening. Several\r\nlarge stones came rolling clown from the diluvium in the course of\r\nthe afternoon. They were of different qualities from the Sandstone\r\nbelow, and from one another; and, what was more wonderful still,\r\nthey were all rounded and water-worn, as if they had been tossed\r\nabout in the sea, or the bed of a river, for hundreds of years. There\r\ncould not, surely, be a more conclusive proof that the bank which\r\nhad enclosed them so long could not have been created on the rock on\r\nwhich it rested. No workman ever manufactures a half-worn article,\r\nand the stones were all half-worn! And if not the bank, why then the\r\nsandstone underneath? I was lost in conjecture, and found I had\r\nfood enough for thought that evening, without once thinking of the\r\nunhappiness of a life of labor.\r\n\r\nThe immense masses of diluvium which we had to clear away rendered\r\nthe working of the quarry laborious and expensive, and all the party\r\nquitted it in a few days, to make trial of another that seemed to\r\npromise better. The one we left is situated, as I have said, on\r\nthe southern shore of an inland bay--the Bay of Cromarty; the one\r\nto which we removed has been opened in a lofty wall of cliffs that\r\noverhangs the northern shore of the Moray Frith. I soon found I was\r\nto be no loser by the change. Not the united labors of a thousand men\r\nfor more than a thousand years could have furnished a better section\r\nof the geology of the district than this range of cliffs. It may be\r\nregarded as a sort of chance dissection on the earth's crust. We see\r\nin one place the primary rock, with its veins of granite and quartz,\r\nits dizzy precipices of gneiss, and its huge masses of hornblende; we\r\nfind the secondary rock in another, with its beds of sandstone and\r\nshale, its spars, its clays, and its nodular limestones. We discover\r\nthe still little known but highly interesting fossils of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone in one deposition; we find the beautifully preserved\r\nshells and lignites of the Lias in another. There are the remains of\r\ntwo several creations at once before us. The shore, too, is heaped\r\nwith rolled fragments of almost every variety of rock,--basalts,\r\nironstones, hypersthenes, porphyries, bituminous shales, and\r\nmicaceous schists. In short, the young geologist, had he all Europe\r\nbefore him, could hardly choose for himself a better field. I had,\r\nhowever, no one to tell me so at the time, for geology had not yet\r\ntravelled so far north; and so, without guide or vocabulary, I had\r\nto grope my way as I best might, and find out all its wonders for\r\nmyself. But so slow T was the process, and so much was I a seeker in\r\nthe dark, that the facts contained in these few sentences were the\r\npatient gatherings of years.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the first day's employment, I picked up a nodular\r\nmass of blue limestone, and laid it open by a stroke of the hammer.\r\nWonderful to relate, it contained inside a beautifully finished piece\r\nof sculpture--one of the volutes apparently of an Ionic capital; and\r\nnot the far-famed walnut of the fairy tale, had I broken the shell\r\nand found the little dog lying within, could have surprised me more.\r\nWas there another such curiosity in the whole world? I broke open a\r\nfew other nodules of similar appearance,--for they lay pretty thickly\r\non the shore,--and found that there might. In one of these there\r\nwere what seemed to be the scales of fishes, and the impressions of\r\na few minute bivalves, prettily striated; in the centre of another\r\nthere was actually a piece of decayed wood. Of all Nature's riddles\r\nthese seemed to me to be at once the most interesting, and the most\r\ndifficult to expound. I treasured them carefully up, and was told\r\nby one of the workmen to whom I showed them, that there was a part\r\nof the shore about two miles farther to the west, where curiously\r\nshaped stones, somewhat like the heads of boarding-pikes, were\r\noccasionally picked up; and that in his father's days the country\r\npeople called them thunderbolts, and deemed them of sovereign\r\nefficacy in curing bewitched cattle. Our employer, on quitting the\r\nquarry for the building on which we were to be engaged, gave all the\r\nworkmen a half-holiday. I employed it in visiting the place where the\r\nthunderbolts had fallen so thickly, and found it a richer scene of\r\nwonder than I could have fancied in even my dreams.\r\n\r\nWhat first attracted my notice was a detached group of low lying\r\nskerries, wholly different in form and color from the sandstone\r\ncliffs above, or the primary rocks a little farther to the west. I\r\nfound them composed of thin strata of limestone, alternating with\r\nthicker beds of a black slaty substance, which, as I ascertained in\r\nthe course of the evening, burns with a powerful flame, and emits\r\na strong bituminous odor. The layers into which the beds readily\r\nseparate are hardly an eighth part of an inch in thickness, and yet\r\non every layer there are the impressions of thousands and tens of\r\nthousands of the various fossils peculiar to the Lias. We may turn\r\nover these wonderful leaves one after one, like the leaves of a\r\nherbarium, and find the pictorial records of a former creation in\r\nevery page. Scallops, and gryphites, and ammonites, of almost every\r\nvariety peculiar to the formation, and at least some eight or ten\r\nvarieties of belemnite; twigs of wood, leaves of plants, cones of an\r\nextinct species of pine, bits of charcoal, and the scales of fishes;\r\nand, as if to render their pictorial appearance more striking, though\r\nthe leaves of this interesting volume are of a deep black, most of\r\nthe impressions are of a chalky whiteness. I was lost in admiration\r\nand astonishment, and found my very imagination paralyzed by an\r\nassemblage of wonders, that seemed to outrival, in the fantastic\r\nand the extravagant, even its wildest conceptions. I passed on from\r\nledge to ledge, like the traveller of the tale through the city of\r\nstatues, and at length found one of the supposed aerolites I had come\r\nin quest of, firmly imbedded in a mass of shale. But I had skill\r\nenough to determine that it was other than what it had been deemed.\r\nA very near relative, who had been a sailor in his time on almost\r\nevery ocean, and had visited almost every quarter of the globe, had\r\nbrought home one of these meteoric stones with him from the coast\r\nof Java. It was of a cylindrical shape and vitreous texture, and it\r\nseemed to have parted in the middle when in a half-molten state,\r\nand to have united again, somewhat awry, ere it had cooled enough\r\nto have lost the adhesive quality. But there was nothing organic\r\nin its structure, whereas the stone I had now found was organized\r\nvery curiously indeed. It was of a conical form and filamentary\r\ntexture, the filaments radiating in straight lines from the centre\r\nto the circumference. Finely-marked veins like white threads ran\r\ntransversely through these in its upper half to the point, while the\r\nspace below was occupied by an internal cone, formed of plates that\r\nlay parallel to the base, and which, like watch-glasses, were concave\r\non the under side, and convex on the upper. I learned in time to call\r\nthis stone a belemnite, and became acquainted with enough of its\r\nhistory to know that it once formed part of a variety of cuttle-fish,\r\nlong since extinct.\r\n\r\nMy first year of labor came to a close, and I found that the\r\namount of my happiness had not been less than in the last of my\r\nboyhood. My knowledge, too, had increased in more than the ratio\r\nof former seasons; and as I had acquired the skill of at least\r\nthe common mechanic, I had fitted myself for independence. The\r\nadditional experience of twenty years has not shown me that there\r\nis any necessary connection between a life of toil and a life\r\nof wretchedness; and when I have found good men anticipating a\r\nbetter and a happier time than either the present or the past, the\r\nconviction that in every period of the world's history the great\r\nbulk of mankind must pass their days in labor, has not in the least\r\ninclined me to scepticism.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity, once fully awakened, remained awake, and my\r\nopportunities of gratifying it have been tolerably ample. I have been\r\nan explorer of caves and ravines--a loiterer along sea-shores--a\r\nclimber among rocks--a laborer in quarries. My profession was a\r\nwandering one. I remember passing direct, on one occasion, from the\r\nwild western coast of Ross-shire, where the Old Red Sandstone leans\r\nat a high angle against the prevailing Quartz Rock of the district,\r\nto where, on the southern skirts of Mid-Lothian, the Mountain\r\nLimestone rises amid the coal. I have resided one season on a raised\r\nbeach of the Moray Frith. I have spent the season immediately\r\nfollowing amid the ancient granites and contorted schists of the\r\ncentral Highlands. In the north I have laid open by thousands the\r\nshells and lignites of the Oolite; in the south I have disinterred\r\nfrom their matrices of stone or of shale the huge reeds and tree\r\nferns of the Carboniferous period. I have been taught by experience,\r\ntoo, how necessary an acquaintance with geology of both extremes\r\nof the kingdom is to the right understanding of the formations of\r\neither. In the north, there occurs a vast gap in the scale. The\r\nLias leans unconformably against the Old Red Sandstone; there is no\r\nMountain Limestone, no Coal Measures, none of the New Red Marls or\r\nSandstones, Under or Upper. There are at least three entire systems\r\nomitted. But the upper portion of the scale is well nigh complete.\r\nIn one locality we may pass from the Lower to the Upper Lias, in\r\nanother from the Inferior to the Great Oolite, and onward to the\r\nOxford Clay and the Coral Rag. We may explore, in a third locality,\r\nbeds identical in their organisms with the Wealden of Sussex. In a\r\nfourth we find the flints and fossils of the Chalk. The lower part of\r\nthe scale is also well nigh complete. The Old Red Sandstone is amply\r\ndeveloped in Moray, Caithness, and Ross; and the Grauwacke, in its\r\nmore ancient unfossiliferous type, rather extensively in Banffshire.\r\nBut to acquaint one's self with the three missing formations,--to\r\ncomplete one's knowledge of the entire scale by filling up the\r\nhiatus,--it is necessary to remove to the south. The geology of the\r\nLothians is the geology of at least two thirds of the gap, and\r\nperhaps a little more;--the geology of Arran wants, it is supposed,\r\nonly the Upper New lied Sandstone to fill it entirely.\r\n\r\nOne important truth I would fain press on the attention of my\r\nlowlier readers. There are few professions, however humble, that\r\ndo not present their peculiar advantages of observation; there are\r\nnone, I repeat, in which the exercise of the faculties does not lead\r\nto enjoyment. I advise the stone-mason, for instance, to acquaint\r\nhimself with Geology. Much of his time must be spent amid the rocks\r\nand quarries of widely separated localities. The bridge or harbor\r\nis no sooner completed in one district, than he has to remove to\r\nwhere the gentleman's seat, or farm-steading is to be erected in\r\nanother; and so, in the course of a few years, he may pass over\r\nthe whole geological scale, even when restricted to Scotland, from\r\nthe Grauwacke of the Lammermuirs, to the Wealden of Moray, or\r\nthe Chalk-flints of Banffshire and Aberdeen; and this, too, with\r\nopportunities of observation, at every stage, which can be shared\r\nwith him by only the gentleman of fortune, who devotes his whole time\r\nto the study. Nay, in some respects, his advantages are superior\r\nto those of the amateur himself. The latter must often pronounce a\r\nformation unfossiliferous when, after the examination of at most a\r\nfew days, he discovers in it nothing organic; and it will be found\r\nthat half the mistakes of geologists have arisen from conclusions\r\nthus hastily formed. But the working-man, whose employments have\r\nto be carried on in the same formation for months, perhaps years,\r\ntogether, enjoys better opportunities for arriving at just decisions.\r\nThere are, besides, a thousand varieties of accident which lead\r\nto discovery--floods, storms, landslips, tides of unusual height,\r\nebbs of extraordinary fall: and the man who plies his labor at all\r\nseasons in the open air has by much the best, chance of profiting\r\nby these. There are formations which yield their organisms slowly\r\nto the discoverer, and the proofs which establish their place in\r\nthe geological scale more tardily still. I was acquainted with the\r\nOld Red Sandstone of Ross and Cromarty for nearly ten years ere I\r\nhad ascertained that it is richly fossiliferous--a discovery which,\r\nin exploring this formation in those localities, some of our first\r\ngeologists had failed to anticipate. I was acquainted with it for\r\nnearly ten years more ere I could assign to its fossils their exact\r\nplace in the scale.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters I shall confine my observations chiefly\r\nto this system and its organisms. To none of the others, perhaps,\r\nexcepting the Lias of the north of Scotland, have I devoted an equal\r\ndegree of attention; nor is there a formation among them which, up\r\nto the present time, has remained so much a _terra incognita_ to the\r\ngeologist. The space on both sides has been carefully explored to\r\nits upper and lower boundary; the space between has been suffered\r\nto remain well nigh a chasm. Should my facts regarding it--facts\r\nconstituting the slow gatherings of years--serve as stepping-stones\r\nlaid across, until such time as geologists of greater skill, and more\r\nextended research, shall have bridged over the gap, I shall have\r\ncompleted half my design. Should the working-man be encouraged by my\r\nmodicum of success to improve his opportunities of observation, I\r\nshall have accomplished the whole of it. It cannot be too extensively\r\nknown, that nature is vast and knowledge limited; and that no\r\nindividual, however humble in place or acquirement, need despair of\r\nadding to the general fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone.--Till very lately its Existence as a distinct\r\nFormation disputed.--Still little known.--Its great Importance in the\r\nGeological Scale.--Illustration.--The North of Scotland girdled by\r\nan immense Belt of Old Red Sandstone.--Line of the Girdle along the\r\nCoast.--Marks of vast Denudation.--Its Extent partially indicated by\r\nHills on the Western Coast of Ross-shire.--The System of Great Depth\r\nin the North of Scotland.--Difficulties in the way of estimating the\r\nThickness of Deposits.--Peculiar Formation of Hill.--Illustrated\r\nby Ben Nevis.--Caution to the Geological Critic.--Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone immensely developed in Caithness.--Sketch of the Geology\r\nof that County.--Its strange Group of Fossils.--Their present\r\nplace of Sepulture.--Their ancient Habitat.--Agassiz.--Amazing\r\nProgress of Fossil Ichthyology during the last few Years.--Its\r\nNomenclature.--Learned Names repel unlearned Readers.--Not a great\r\ndeal in them.\r\n\r\n\"The Old Red Sandstone,\" says a Scottish geologist, in a digest of\r\nsome recent geological discoveries, which appeared a short time\r\nago in an Edinburgh newspaper, \"has been hitherto considered as\r\nremarkably barren of fossils.\" The remark is expressive of a pretty\r\ngeneral opinion among geologists of even the present time, and I\r\nquote it on this account. Only a few years have gone by since men of\r\nno low standing in the science disputed the very existence of this\r\nformation--system rather, for it contains at least three distinct\r\nformations; and but for the influence of one accomplished geologist,\r\nthe celebrated author of the _Silurian System_, it would have been\r\nprobably degraded from its place in the scale altogether. \"You\r\nmust inevitably give up the Old Red Sandstone,\" said an ingenious\r\nforeigner to Mr. Murchison, when on a visit to England about four\r\nyears ago, and whose celebrity among his own countrymen rested\r\nchiefly on his researches in the more ancient formations,--\"you must\r\ninevitably give up the Old Red Sandstone: it is a mere local deposit,\r\na doubtful accumulation huddled up in a corner, and has no type or\r\nrepresentative abroad.\" \"I would willingly give it up if nature\r\nwould,\" was the reply; \"but it assuredly exists, and I cannot.\" In\r\na recently published tabular exhibition of the geological scale\r\nby a continental geologist, I could not distinguish this system\r\nat all. There are some of our British geologists, too, who still\r\nregard it as a sort of debatable tract, entitled to no independent\r\nstatus. They find, in what they deem its upper beds, the fossils\r\nof the Coal Measures, and the lower graduating apparently into the\r\nSilurian System; and regard the whole as a sort of common, which\r\nshould be divided as proprietors used to divide commons in Scotland\r\nhalf a century ago, by giving a portion to each of the bordering\r\nterritories. Even the better informed geologists, who assign to it\r\nits proper place as an independent formation, furnished with its own\r\norganisms, contrive to say all they know regarding it in a very few\r\nparagraphs. Lyell, in the first edition of his admirable elementary\r\nwork, published only two years ago, devotes more than thirty pages to\r\nhis description of the Coal Measures, and but two and a half to his\r\nnotice of the Old Red Sandstone.[C]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: As the succinct notice of this distinguished geologist\r\nmay serve as a sort of pocket map to the reader in indicating the\r\nposition of the system, its three great deposits, and its extent, I\r\ntake the liberty of transferring it entire.\r\n\r\n\"OLD RED SANDSTONE.\r\n\r\n\"It was stated that the Carboniferous formation was surmounted by one\r\ncalled the 'New lied Sandstone,' and underlaid by another called the\r\nOld Red, which last was formerly merged in the Carboniferous System,\r\nbut is now found to be distinguishable by its fossils. The Old Red\r\nSandstone is of enormous thickness in Herefordshire, Worcestershire,\r\nShropshire, and South Wales, where it is seen to crop out beneath the\r\nCoal Measures, and to repose on the Silurian Rocks. In that region,\r\nits thickness has been estimated by Mr. Murchison at no less than ten\r\nthousand feet. It consists there of--\r\n\r\n\"1st. A quartzose conglomerate, passing downwards into chocolate-red\r\nand green sandstone and marl.\r\n\r\n\"2d. Cornstone and marl, (red and green argillaceous spotted\r\nmarls, with irregular courses of impure concretionary limestone,\r\nprovincially called Cornstone, mottled red and green; remains of\r\nfishes.)\r\n\r\n\"3d. Tilestone, (finely laminated hard reddish or green micaceous or\r\nquartzose sandstones, which split into tiles; remains of mollusca and\r\nfishes.)\r\n\r\n\"I have already observed that fossils are rare in marls and\r\nsandstones in which the red oxide of iron prevails. In the Cornstone,\r\nhowever, of the counties above mentioned, fishes of the genera\r\nCephalaspis and Onchus have been discovered. In the Tilestone,\r\nalso, Ichthyodorulites of the genus Onchus have been obtained,\r\nand a species of Dipterus, with mollusca of the genera Avicula,\r\nArea, Cucullæa, Terebratula, Lingula, Turbo, Trochus, Turritella,\r\nBellerophon, Orthoceras, and others.\r\n\r\n\"By consulting geological maps, the reader will perceive that, from\r\nWales to the north of Scotland, the Old Red Sandstone appears in\r\npatches, and often in large tracts. Many fishes have been found in\r\nit at Caithness, and various organic remains in the northern part of\r\nFifeshire, where it crops out from beneath the Coal formation, and\r\nspreads into the adjoining northern half of Forfarshire; forming,\r\ntogether with trap, the Sidlaw Hills and valley of Strathmore. A\r\nlarge belt of this formation skirts the northern borders of the\r\nGrampians, from the sea-coast at Stonehaven and the Frith of Tay to\r\nthe opposite western coast of the Frith of Clyde. In Forfarshire,\r\nwhere, as in Herefordshire, it is many thousand feet thick, it\r\nmay be divided into three principal masses--1st. Red and mottled\r\nmarls, cornstone, and sandstone; 2d. Conglomerate, often of vast\r\nthickness; 3d. Tilestones, and paving-stone, highly micaceous, and\r\ncontaining a slight admixture of carbonate of lime. In the uppermost\r\nof these divisions, but chiefly in the lowest, the remains of fish\r\nhave been found, of the genus named by M. Agassiz Cephalaspis, or\r\nbuckler-headed, from the extraordinary shield which covers the\r\nhead, and which, has often been mistaken for that of a trilobite\r\nof the division Asaphus. A gigantic species of fish, of the genus\r\nHoloptychius, has also been found by Dr. Fleming in the Old Red\r\nSandstone of Fifeshire.\"--Lyell's _Elements_, pp. 452-4.]\r\n\r\nIt will be found, however, that this hitherto neglected system yields\r\nin importance to none of the others, whether we take into account\r\nits amazing depth, the great extent to which it is developed both\r\nat home and abroad, the interesting links which it furnishes in the\r\nzoölogical scale, or the vast period of time which it represents.\r\nThere are localities in which the depth of the Old Red Sandstone\r\nfully equals the elevation of Mount Ætna over the level of the sea,\r\nand in which it contains three distinct groups of organic remains,\r\nthe one rising in beautiful progression over the other. Let the\r\nreader imagine a digest of English history, complete from the times\r\nof the invasion of Julius Cæsar to the reign of that Harold who was\r\nslain at Hastings, and from the times of Edward III. down to the\r\npresent day, but bearing no record of the Williams, the Henrys, the\r\nEdwards, the John, Stephen, and Richard, that reigned during the\r\nomitted period, or of the striking and important events by which\r\ntheir several reigns were distinguished. A chronicle thus mutilated\r\nand incomplete would be no unapt representation of a geological\r\nhistory of the earth in which the period of the Upper Silurian would\r\nbe connected with that of the Mountain Limestone, or of the limestone\r\nof Burdie House, and the period of the Old Red Sandstone omitted.\r\n\r\nThe eastern and western coasts of Scotland, which lie to the north\r\nof the Friths of Forth and Clyde, together with the southern flank\r\nof the Grampians and the northern coast of Sutherland and Caithness,\r\nappear to have been girdled at some early period by immense\r\ncontinuous beds of Old Red Sandstone. At a still earlier time, the\r\ngirdle seems to have formed an entire mantle, which covered the\r\nenclosed tract from side to side. The interior is composed of what,\r\nafter the elder geologists, I shall term primary rocks--porphyries,\r\ngranites, gneisses, and micaceous schists; and this central nucleus,\r\nas it now exists, seems set in a sandstone frame. The southern bar\r\nof the frame is still entire: it stretches along the Grampians from\r\nStonehaven to the Frith of Clyde. The northern bar is also well nigh\r\nentire: it runs unbroken along the whole northern coast of Caithness,\r\nand studs, in three several localities, the northern coast of\r\nSutherland, leaving breaches of no very considerable extent between.\r\nOn the east, there are considerable gaps, as along the shores of\r\nAberdeenshire.[D] The sandstone, however, appears at Gamrie, in the\r\ncounty of Banff, in a line parallel to the coast, and, after another\r\ninterruption, follows the coast of the Moray Frith far into the\r\ninterior of the great Caledonian valley, and then running northward\r\nalong the shores of Cromarty, Ross, and Sutherland, joins, after\r\nanother brief interruption, the northern bar at Caithness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: The progress of discovery has shown, since this passage\r\nwas written, that these gaps are not quite so considerable as I had\r\nsupposed. The following paragraph, which appeared in July, 1843, in\r\nan Aberdeen paper, bears directly on the point, and is worthy of\r\nbeing preserved:--\r\n\r\n\"ARTESIAN WELL.\r\n\r\n\"The greatest of these interesting works yet existing in Aberdeen has\r\njust been successfully completed at the tape-works of Messrs. Milne,\r\nLow, and Co., Woolmanhill. The bore is 8 inches in diameter, and 250\r\nfeet 9 inches deep. It required nearly eleven months' working to\r\ncomplete the excavation.\r\n\r\n\"In its progress, the following strata were cut through in\r\nsuccession:--\r\n\r\n    6 feet vegetable mould.\r\n   18  \"   gray or bluish clay.\r\n   20  \"   sand and shingle, enclosing rolled stones of various sizes.\r\n    6  \"   light blue clay.\r\n    3  \"   rough sand and shingle.\r\n  115  \"   Old Red Sandstone conglomerate, composed of red clay,\r\n             quartz, mica, and rolled stones.\r\n   74  \"   alternating strata of compact, fine-grained Red Sandstone,\r\n             varying in thickness from 1 to 7 feet, and clay, varying\r\n             from 6 inches to 12 feet thick.\r\n    8  \"   9 inches, mica-slate formation, the first two feet of which\r\n              were chiefly a hard, brown quartzose substance, containing\r\n              iron, manganese, and carbonate of lime.\r\n  -----------\r\n  250 feet, 9 inches.\r\n\r\n\"The temperature of the water at the bottom of the well, when\r\ncompleted, was found to be within a fraction of 50° Fahrenheit, and\r\nthe average temperature of the locality, deduced from twenty-three\r\nyears' observation, by the late George limes, F. R. S., is 47°\r\n1: hence, nearly 3 degrees of increase appear as the effects of\r\ncentral heat. The supply of water obtained is excellent in quality,\r\nand sufficient in quantity for all the purposes of the works. Such\r\nan opportunity of investigating the geology of the locality can\r\nbut rarely occur; and, in the present instance, the proprietor\r\nand managers afforded every facility to scientific inquirers for\r\nconducting examinations. To make the bearings of the case clear\r\nand simple, the following is quoted from Mr. Miller's work on the\r\nOld Red Sandstone. [The writer here quotes the above passage, and\r\nthen proceeds.] Mr. Miller will be glad to learn, that though the\r\nconvulsions of nature have shattered the 'frame' along the shores\r\nof Aberdeenshire, yet the fragments are not lost, as will be seen\r\nfrom the section above described; they are here reposing _in situ_\r\nunder the accumulated debris of uncounted ages--chiefly the 'boulder\r\nclay,' and sedimentary deposits of the Dee and Don, during a period\r\nwhen they mingled their waters in the basin in which Aberdeen now\r\nstands. The primary rocks--the settings--our granites, of matchless\r\nbeauty stand out in bold relief a mile or two westward from the\r\nsea-coast. Within this year or two, the 'Old Red' has been discovered\r\nat Devanha, Union Grove, Huntly Street, Glenburnie, Balgownie, and\r\nvarious other localities to the northward. Hence it may reasonably\r\nbe inferred, that our fragment of the 'frame' envelops the primary\r\nrocks under our city, and along the coast for a considerable distance\r\nbetween the Dee and the Buchaness.\"--_Aberdeen Constitutional_.]\r\n\r\nThe western bar has also its breaches towards the south; but it\r\nstretches, almost without interruption, for about a hundred miles,\r\nfrom the near neighborhood of Cape Wrath to the southern extremity\r\nof Applecross; and though greatly disturbed and overflown by the\r\ntraps of the inner Hebrides, it can be traced by occasional patches\r\non towards the southern bar. It appears on the northern shore of\r\nLoch Alsh, on the eastern shore of Loch Eichart, on the southern\r\nshore of Loch Eil, on the coast and islands near Oban, and on the\r\neast coast of Arran. Detached hills and island-like patches of\r\nthe same formation occur in several parts of the interior, far\r\nwithin the frame or girdle. It caps some of the higher summits in\r\nSutherlandshire; it forms an oasis of sandstone among the primary\r\ndistricts of Strathspey; it rises on the northern shores of Loch\r\nNess in an immense mass of conglomerate, based on a small-grained,\r\nred granite, to a height of about three thousand feet over the\r\nlevel; and on the north-western coast of Ross-shire it forms three\r\nimmense insulated hills, of at least no lower altitude, that rest\r\nunconformably on a base of gneiss.\r\n\r\nThere appear every where in connection with these patches and\r\neminences, and with the surrounding girdle, marks of vast denudation.\r\nI have often stood fronting the three Ross-shire hills[E] at sunset\r\nin the finer summer evenings, when the clear light threw the shadows\r\nof their gigantic, cone-like forms far over the lower tract, and\r\nlighted up the lines of their horizontal strata, till they showed\r\nlike courses of masonry in a pyramid. They seem at such times as if\r\ncolored by the geologist, to distinguish them from the surrounding\r\ntract, and from the base on which they rest as on a common pedestal.\r\nThe prevailing gneiss of the district reflects a cold, bluish hue,\r\nhere and there speckled with white, where the weathered and lichened\r\ncrags of intermingled quartz rock jut out on the hill-sides from\r\namong the heath. The three huge pyramids, on the contrary, from\r\nthe deep red of the stone, seem flaming in purple. There spreads\r\nall around a wild and desolate landscape of broken and shattered\r\nhills, separated by deep and gloomy ravines, that seem the rents\r\nand fissures of a planet in ruins, and that speak distinctly of a\r\nperiod of convulsion, when upheaving fires from the abyss, and ocean\r\ncurrents above, had contended in sublime antagonism, the one slowly\r\nelevating the entire tract, the other grinding it down and sweeping\r\nit away. I entertain little doubt that, when this loftier portion of\r\nScotland, including the entire Highlands, first presented its broad\r\nback over the waves, the upper surface consisted exclusively, from\r\nthe one extremity to the other--from Benlomond to the Maidenpaps of\r\nCaithness--of a continuous tract of Old Red Sandstone; though, ere\r\nthe land finally emerged, the ocean currents of ages had swept it\r\naway, all except in the lower and last-raised borders, and in the\r\ndetached localities, where it still remains, as in the pyramidal\r\nhills of western Ross-shire, to show the amazing depth to which\r\nit had once overlaid the inferior rocks. The Old Red Sandstone\r\nof Morvheim, in Caithness, overlooks all the primary hills of the\r\ndistrict, from an elevation of three thousand five hundred feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Suil Veinn, Coul Beg, and Coul More.]\r\n\r\nThe depth of the system, on both the eastern and western coasts\r\nof Scotland, is amazingly great--how great, I shall not venture\r\nto say. There are no calculations more doubtful than those of the\r\ngeologist. The hill just instanced (Morvheim) is apparently composed\r\nfrom top to bottom of what in Scotland forms the lowest member of\r\nthe system--a coarse conglomerate; and yet I have nowhere observed\r\nthis inferior member, when I succeeded in finding a section of it\r\ndirectly vertical, more than a hundred yards in thickness--less than\r\none tenth the height of the hill. It would be well nigh as unsafe\r\nto infer that the three thousand five hundred feet of altitude\r\nformed the real thickness of the conglomerate, as to infer that the\r\nthickness of the lead which covers the dome of St. Paul's is equal to\r\nthe height of the dome. It is always perilous to estimate the depth\r\nof a deposit by the height of a hill that seems externally composed\r\nof it, unless, indeed, like the pyramidal hills of Ross-shire, it\r\nbe unequivocally a hill dug out by denudation, as the sculptor digs\r\nhis eminences out of the mass. In most of our hills, the upheaving\r\nagency has been actively at work, and the space within is occupied\r\nby an immense nucleus of inferior rock, around which the upper\r\nformation is wrapped like a caul, just as the vegetable mould or\r\nthe diluvium wraps up this superior covering in turn. One of our\r\nbest known Scottish mountains--the gigantic Ben Nevis--furnishes an\r\nadmirable illustration of this latter construction of hill. It is\r\ncomposed of three zones or rings of rock, the one rising over and\r\nout of the other, like the cases of an opera-glass drawn out. The\r\nlower zone is composed of gneiss and mica-slate, the middle zone\r\nof granite, the terminating zone of porphyry. The elevating power\r\nappears to have acted in the centre, as in the well-known case of\r\nJorullo, in the neighborhood of the city of Mexico, where a level\r\ntract four square miles in extent rose, about the middle of the last\r\ncentury, into a high dome of more than double the height of Arthur's\r\nSeat.[F] In the formation of our Scottish mountain, the gneiss and\r\nmica-slate of the district seem to have been upheaved, during the\r\nfirst period of Plutonic action in the locality, into a rounded\r\nhill of moderate altitude, but of huge base. The upheaving power\r\ncontinued to operate--the gneiss and mica-slate gave way a-top--and\r\nout of this lower dome there arose a higher dome of granite, which,\r\nin an after and terminating period of the internal activity, gave\r\nway in turn to yet a third and last dome of porphyry. Now, had the\r\nelevating forces ceased to operate just ere the gneiss and mica-slate\r\nhad given way, we would have known nothing of the interior nucleus\r\nof granite--had they ceased just ere the granite had given way, we\r\nwould have known nothing of the yet deeper nucleus of porphyry; and\r\nyet the granite and the porphyry would assuredly have been there.\r\nNor could any application of the measuring rule to the side of the\r\nhill have ascertained the thickness of its outer covering--the gneiss\r\nand the mica schist. The geologists of the school of Werner used to\r\nillustrate what we may term the anatomy of the earth, as seen through\r\nthe spectacles of their system, by an onion and its coats: they\r\nrepresented the globe as a central nucleus, encircled by concentric\r\ncoverings, each covering constituting a geological formation. The\r\nonion, through the introduction of a better school, has become\r\nobsolete as an illustration; but to restore it again, though for\r\nanother purpose, we have merely to cut it through the middle, and\r\nturn downwards the planes formed by the knife. It then represents,\r\nwith its coats, hills such as we describe--hills such as Ben Nevis,\r\nere the granite had perforated the gneiss, or the porphyry broken\r\nthrough the granite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: It is rarely that the geologist catches a hill in\r\nthe act of forming, and hence the interest of this well-attested\r\ninstance. From the period of the discovery of America to the middle\r\nof the last century, the plains of Jorullo had undergone no change of\r\nsurface, and the seat of the present hill was covered by plantations\r\nof indigo and sugar-cane, when, in June, 1759, hollow sounds were\r\nheard, and a succession of earthquakes continued for sixty days,\r\nto the great consternation of the inhabitants. After the cessation\r\nof these, and in a period of tranquillity, on the 28th and 29th of\r\nSeptember, a horrible subterranean noise was again heard, and a\r\ntract four square miles in extent rose up in the shape of a dome or\r\nbladder, to the height of sixteen hundred and seventy feet above\r\nthe original level of the plain. The affrighted Indians fled to\r\nthe mountains; and from thence looking down on the phenomenon, saw\r\nflames issuing from the earth for miles around the newly-elevated\r\nhill, and the softened surface rising and falling like that of an\r\nagitated sea, and opening into numerous rents and fissures. Two\r\nbrooks which had watered the plantations precipitated themselves into\r\nthe burning chasms. The scene of this singular event was visited by\r\nHumboldt about the beginning of the present century. At that period,\r\nthe volcanic agencies had become comparatively quiescent; the hill,\r\nhowever, retained its original altitude; a number of smaller hills\r\nhad sprung up around it; and the traveller found the waters of the\r\nengulfed rivulets escaping at a high temperature from caverns charged\r\nwith sulphureous vapors and carbonic acid gas. There wore inhabitants\r\nof the country living at the time who were more than twenty years\r\nolder than the hill of Jorullo, and who had witnessed its rise.]\r\n\r\nIf it be thus unsafe, however, to calculate on the depth of deposits\r\nby the altitude of hills, it is quite as unsafe for the geologist,\r\nwho has studied a formation in one district, to set himself to\r\ncriticise the calculations of a brother geologist by whom it has been\r\nstudied in a different and widely-separated district. A deposit in\r\none locality may be found to possess many times the thickness of the\r\nsame deposit in another. There are exposed, beside the Northern and\r\nSouthern Sutors of Cromarty, two nearly vertical sections of the\r\ncoarse conglomerate bed, which forms, as I have said, in the north of\r\nScotland, the base of the Old Red System, and which rises to so great\r\nan elevation in the mountain of Morvheim. The sections are little\r\nmore than a mile apart; and yet, while the thickness of this bed in\r\nthe one does not exceed one hundred feet, that of the same bed in the\r\nother somewhat exceeds two hundred feet. More striking still--under\r\nthe Northern Sutor, the entire Geology of Caithness, with all its\r\nvast beds, and all its numerous fossils, from the granitic rock of\r\nthe Ord hill, the southern boundary of the county, to the uppermost\r\nsandstones of Dunnet-head, its extreme northern corner, is exhibited\r\nin a vertical section not more than three hundred yards in extent.\r\nAnd yet so enormous is the depth of the deposit in Caithness, that\r\nit has been deemed by a very superior geologist to represent three\r\nentire formations--the Old Red System, by its unfossiliferous,\r\narenaceous, and conglomerate beds; the Carboniferous System, by its\r\ndark-colored middle schists, abounding in bitumen and ichthyolites;\r\nand the New Red Sandstone, by the mottled marls and mouldering\r\nsandstones that overlie the whole.[G] A slight sketch of the Geology\r\nof Caithness may not be deemed uninteresting. This county includes,\r\nin the state of greatest development any where yet known, that\r\nfossiliferous portion of the Old Red Sandstone which I purpose first\r\nto describe, and which will yet come to be generally regarded as an\r\nindependent formation, as unequivocally characterized by its organic\r\nremains as the formations either above or below it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: Dr. Hibbert, whose researches among the limestones\r\nof Burdie House have been of such importance to Geology, was of\r\nthis opinion. I find it also expressed in the admirable geological\r\nappendix affixed by the Messrs. Anderson to their _Guide to the\r\nHighlands and Islands of Scotland_. \"No beds of real coal,\" say these\r\ngentlemen, \"have been discovered in Caithness; and it would thus\r\nappear that the middle schistose system of the county, containing the\r\nfossil fish, is in geological character and position intermediate\r\nbetween the Old and New Red Sandstone formations, but not identical\r\nwith the Carboniferous Limestone, or the true Coal Measures, although\r\nprobably occupying the place of one or other of them.\"--p. 198.]\r\n\r\nThe county of Sutherland stretches across the island from the\r\nGerman to the Atlantic Ocean, and presents, throughout its entire\r\nextent,--except where a narrow strip of the Oolitic formation runs\r\nalong its eastern coast, and a broken belt of Old Red Sandstone tips\r\nits capes and promontories on the west,--a broken and tumultuous\r\nsea of primary hills. Scarce any of our other Scottish counties are\r\nso exclusively Highland, nor are there any of them in which the\r\nprecipices are more abrupt, the valleys more deep, the rivers more\r\nrapid, or the mountains piled into more fantastic groups and masses.\r\nThe traveller passes into Caithness, and finds himself surrounded by\r\nscenery of an aspect so entirely dissimilar, that no examination of\r\nthe rocks is necessary to convince him of a geological difference of\r\nstructure. An elevated and uneven plain spreads around and before\r\nhim, league beyond league, in tame and unvaried uniformity,--its many\r\nhollows darkened by morasses, over which the intervening eminences\r\nrise in the form rather of low moory swellings, than of hills,--its\r\ncoasts walled round by cliffs of gigantic altitude, that elevate the\r\ndistrict at one huge stride from the level of the sea, and skirted by\r\nvast stacks and columns of rock, that stand out like the advanced\r\npickets of the land amid the ceaseless turmoil of the breakers. The\r\ndistrict, as shown on the map, presents nearly a triangular form--the\r\nPentland Frith and the German Ocean describing two of its sides,\r\nwhile the base is formed by the line of boundary which separates it\r\nfrom the county of Sutherland.\r\n\r\nNow, in a geological point of view, this angle may be regarded as a\r\nvast pyramid, rising perpendicularly from the basis furnished by the\r\nprimary rocks of the latter county, and presenting newer beds and\r\nstrata as we ascend, until we reach the apex. The line from south\r\nto north in the angle--from Morvheim to Dunnet-head--corresponds\r\nto the line of ascent from the top to the bottom of the pyramid.\r\nThe first bed, reckoning from the base upwards,--the ground tier\r\nof the masonry, if I may so speak,--is the great conglomerate. It\r\nruns along the line of boundary from sea to sea,--from the Ord of\r\nCaithness on the east, to Portskerry on the north; and rises, as it\r\napproaches the primary hills of Sutherland, into a lofty mountain\r\nchain of bold and serrated outline, which attains its greatest\r\nelevation in the hill of Morvheim. This great conglomerate bed, the\r\nbase of the system, is represented in the Cromarty section, under the\r\nNorthern Sutor, by a bed two hundred and fifteen feet in thickness.\r\nThe second tier of masonry in the pyramid, and which also runs in a\r\nnearly parallel line from sea to sea, is composed mostly of a coarse\r\nred and yellowish sandstone, with here and there beds of pebbles\r\nenclosed, and here and there deposits of green earth and red marl. It\r\nhas its representative in the Cromarty section, in a bed of red and\r\nyellow arenaceous stone, one hundred and fourteen feet six inches in\r\nthickness. These two inferior beds possess but one character,--they\r\nare composed of the same materials, with merely this difference, that\r\nthe rocks which have been broken into pebbles for the construction\r\nof the one, have been ground into sand for the composition of the\r\nother. Directly over them, the middle portion of the pyramid is\r\noccupied by an enormous deposit of dark-colored bituminous schist,\r\nslightly micaceous, calcareous, or semi-calcareous,--here and there\r\ninterlaced with veins of carbonate of lime,--here and there compact\r\nand highly siliceous,--and bearing in many places a mineralogical\r\ncharacter difficult to be distinguished from that at one time deemed\r\npeculiar to the harder grauwacke schists. The Caithness flagstones,\r\nso extensively employed in paving the footways of our larger towns,\r\nare furnished by this immense middle tier or belt, and represent\r\nits general appearance. From its lowest to its highest beds it\r\nis charged with fossil fish and obscure vegetable impressions;\r\nand we find it represented in the Cromarty section by alternating\r\nbands of sandstones, stratified clays, and bituminous and nodular\r\nlimestones, which form altogether a bed three hundred and fifty-five\r\nfeet in thickness; nor does this bed lack its organisms, animal and\r\nvegetable, generically identical with those of Caithness. The apex of\r\nthe pyramid is formed of red mouldering sandstones and mottled marls,\r\nwhich exhibit their uppermost strata high over the eddies of the\r\nPentland Frith, in the huge precipices of Dunnet-head, and which are\r\npartially represented in the Cromarty section by an unfossiliferous\r\nsandstone bed of unascertained thickness; but which can be traced for\r\nabout eighty feet from the upper limestones and stratified clays of\r\nthe middle member, until lost in overlying beds of sand and shingle.\r\n\r\nI am particular, at the risk, I am afraid, of being tedious, in thus\r\ndescribing the Geology of this northern county, and of the Cromarty\r\nsection, which represents and elucidates it. They illustrate more\r\nthan the formations of two insulated districts: they represent also\r\na vast period of time in the history of the globe. The pyramid, with\r\nits three huge bars, its foundations of granitic rock, its base\r\nof red conglomerate, its central band of dark-colored schist, and\r\nits lighter tinted apex of sandstone, is inscribed from bottom to\r\ntop, like an Egyptian obelisk, with a historical record. The upper\r\nand lower sections treat of tempests and currents--the middle is\r\n\"written within and without\" with wonderful narratives of animal\r\nlife; and yet the whole, taken together, comprises but an earlier\r\nportion of that chronicle of existences and events furnished by the\r\nOld Red Sandstone. It is, however, with this earlier portion that my\r\nacquaintance is most minute.\r\n\r\nMy first statement regarding it must be much the reverse of the\r\nborrowed one with which this chapter begins. _The fossils are\r\nremarkably numerous, and in a state of high preservation._ I have\r\na hundred solid proofs by which to establish the truth of the\r\nassertion, within less than a yard of me. Half my closet walls are\r\ncovered with the peculiar fossils of the Lower Old Red Sandstone;\r\nand certainly a stranger assemblage of forms have rarely been\r\ngrouped together;--creatures whose very type is lost, fantastic and\r\nuncouth, and which puzzle the naturalist to assign them even their\r\nclass;--boat-like animals, furnished with oars and a rudder;--fish\r\nplated over, like the tortoise, above and below, with a strong armor\r\nof bone, and furnished with but one solitary rudder-like fin; other\r\nfish less equivocal in their form, but with the membranes of their\r\nfins thickly covered with scales;--creatures bristling over with\r\nthorns; others glistening in an enamelled coat, as if beautifully\r\njapanned--the tail, in every instance among the less equivocal\r\nshapes, formed not equally, as in existing fish, on each side the\r\ncentral vertebral column, but chiefly on the lower side--the column\r\nsending out its diminished vertebræ to the extreme termination of\r\nthe fin. All the forms testify of a remote antiquity--of a period\r\nwhose \"fashions have passed away.\" The figures on a Chinese vase or\r\nan Egyptian obelisk are scarce more unlike what now exists in nature,\r\nthan the fossils of the Lower Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\nGeology, of all the sciences, addresses itself most powerfully to\r\nthe imagination, and hence one main cause of the interest which it\r\nexcites. Ere setting ourselves minutely to examine the peculiarities\r\nof these creatures, it would be perhaps well that the reader should\r\nattempt realizing the _place_ of their existence, and relatively\r\nthe _time_--not of course with regard to dates and eras, for the\r\ngeologist has none to reckon by, but with respect to formations. They\r\nwere the denizens of the same portion of the globe which we ourselves\r\ninhabit, regarded not as a tract of country, but as a piece of ocean\r\ncrossed by the same geographical lines of latitude and longitude.\r\nTheir present place of sepulture in some localities, had there been\r\nno denudation, would have been raised high over the tops of our\r\nloftiest hills--at least a hundred feet over the conglomerates which\r\nform the summit of Morvheim, and more than a thousand feet over the\r\nsnow-capped Ben Wyvis. Geology has still greater wonders. I have seen\r\nbelemnites of the Oolite--comparatively a modern formation--which\r\nhad been dug out of the sides of the Himalaya mountains, seventeen\r\nthousand feet over the level of the sea. But let us strive to carry\r\nour minds back, not to the place of sepulture of these creatures,\r\nhigh in the rocks,--though that I shall afterwards attempt minutely\r\nto describe,--but to the place in which they lived, long ere the\r\nsauroid fishes of Burdie House had begun to exist, or the corallines\r\nof the mountain limestone had spread out their multitudinous arms\r\nin a sea gradually shallowing, and out of which the land had already\r\npartially emerged.\r\n\r\nA continuous ocean spreads over the space now occupied by the British\r\nislands: in the tract covered by the green fields and brown moors\r\nof our own country, the bottom, for a hundred yards downwards,\r\nis composed of the debris of rolled pebbles and coarse sand\r\nintermingled, long since consolidated into the lower member of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone; the upper surface is composed of banks of sand,\r\nmud, and clay; and the sea, swarming with animal life, flows over\r\nall. My present object is to describe the inhabitants of that sea.\r\n\r\nOf these, the greater part yet discovered have been named by Agassiz,\r\nthe highest authority as an ichthyologist in Europe or the world, and\r\nin whom the scarcely more celebrated Cuvier recognized a naturalist\r\nin every respect worthy to succeed him. The comparative amount of\r\nthe labors of these two great men in fossil ichthyology, and the\r\namazing acceleration which has taken place within the last few years\r\nin the progress of geological science, are illustrated together,\r\nand that very strikingly, by the following interesting fact--a fact\r\nderived directly from Agassiz himself, and which must be new to the\r\ngreat bulk of my readers. When Cuvier closed his researches in this\r\ndepartment, he had named and described, for the guidance of the\r\ngeologist, ninety-two distinct species of fossil fish; nor was it\r\nthen known that the entire geological scale, from the Upper Tertiary\r\nto the Grauwacke inclusive, contained more. Agassiz commenced his\r\nlabors; and, in a period of time little exceeding fourteen years, he\r\nhas raised the number of species from ninety-two to sixteen hundred.\r\nAnd this number, great as it is, is receiving accessions almost every\r\nday. In his late visit to Scotland, he found eleven new species, and\r\none new genus, in the collection of Lady Gumming of Altyre, all\r\nfrom the upper beds of that lower member of the Old Red Sandstone\r\nrepresented by the dark-colored schists and inferior sandstones of\r\nCaithness. He found forty-two new species more in a single collection\r\nin Ireland, furnished by the Mountain Limestone of Armagh.\r\n\r\nSome of my humbler readers may possibly be repelled by his names;\r\nthey are, like all names in science, unfamiliar in their respect to\r\nmere English readers, just because they are names not for England\r\nalone, but for England and the world. I am assured, however,\r\nthat they are all composed of very good Greek, and picturesquely\r\ndescriptive of some peculiarity in the fossils they designate.\r\nOne of his ichthyolites, with a thorn or spine in each fin, bears\r\nthe name of _Acanthodes_, or thorn-like; another with a similar\r\nmechanism of spines attached to the upper part of the body,\r\nand in which the pectoral or hand-fins are involved, has been\r\ndesignated the _Cheiracanthus_, or thorn-hand; a third covered with\r\ncuriously-fretted scales, has been named the _Glyptolepis_, or\r\ncarved-scale; and a fourth, roughened over with berry-like tubercles,\r\nthat rise from strong osseous plates, is known as the _Coccosteus_,\r\nor berry-on-bone. And such has been his principle of nomenclature.\r\nThe name is a condensed description. But though all his names mean\r\nsomething, they cannot mean a great deal; and as learned words\r\nrepel unlearned readers, I shall just take the liberty of reminding\r\nmine of the humbler class, that there is no legitimate connection\r\nbetween Geology and the dead languages. The existences of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone had lived for ages, and had been dead for myriads of\r\nages, ere there was Greek enough in the world to furnish them with\r\nnames. There is no working-man, if he be a person of intelligence\r\nand information, however unlearned, in the vulgar acceptation of the\r\nphrase, who may not derive as much pleasure and enlargement of idea\r\nfrom the study of Geology, and acquaint himself as minutely with its\r\ntruths, as if possessed of all the learning of Bentley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck's Theory of Progression illustrated.--Class of Facts which\r\ngive Color to it.--The Credulity of Unbelief.--M.

The ingenious foreigner, on the strength\r\nof a few striking facts, which prove that, to a certain extent,\r\nthe instincts of species may be improved and heightened, and their\r\nforms changed from a lower to a higher degree of adaptation to\r\ntheir circumstances, has concluded that there is a natural progress\r\nfrom the inferior orders of being towards the superior; and that\r\nthe offspring of creatures low in the scale in the present time,\r\nmay hold a much higher place in it, and belong to different and\r\nnobler species, a few thousand years hence. The descendants of the\r\n_ourang-outang_, for instance, may be employed in some future age in\r\nwriting treatises on Geology, in which they shall have to describe\r\nthe remains of the _quadrumana_ as belonging to an extinct order.\r\nLamarck himself, when bearing home in triumph with him the skeleton\r\nof some huge salamander or crocodile of the Lias, might indulge,\r\nconsistently with his theory, in the pleasing belief that he had\r\npossessed himself of the bones of his grandfather--a grandfather\r\nremoved, of course, to a remote degree of consanguinity, by the\r\nintervention of a few hundred thousand _great-greats_. Never yet\r\nwas there a fancy so wild and extravagant but there have been men\r\nbold enough to dignify it with the name of philosophy, and ingenious\r\nenough to find reasons for the propriety of the name.\r\n\r\nThe setting-dog is _taught_ to set; he squats down and points at the\r\ngame; but the habit is an acquired one--a mere trick of education.\r\nWhat, however, is merely acquired habit in the progenitor, is\r\nfound to pass into instinct in the descendant: the puppy of the\r\nsetting-dog squats down and sets _untaught_--the educational trick\r\nof the parent is mysteriously transmuted into an original principle\r\nin the offspring. The adaptation which takes place in the forms and\r\nconstitution of plants and animals, when placed in circumstances\r\ndifferent from their ordinary ones, is equally striking. The\r\nwoody plant of a warmer climate, when transplanted into a colder,\r\nfrequently exchanges its ligneous stem for a herbaceous one, as if\r\nin anticipation of the killing frosts of winter; and, dying to the\r\nground at the close of autumn, shoots up again in spring. The dog,\r\ntransported from a temperate into a frigid region, exchanges his\r\ncovering of hair for a covering of wool; when brought back again to\r\nhis former habitat, the wool is displaced by the original hair. And\r\nhence, and from similar instances, the derivation of an argument,\r\ngood so far as it goes, for changes in adaptation to altered\r\ncircumstances of the organization of plants and animals, and for the\r\nunprovability of instinct. But it is easy driving a principle too\r\nfar. The elasticity of a common bow, and the strength of an ordinary\r\narm, are fully adequate to the transmission of an arrow from one\r\npoint of space to another point a hundred yards removed; but he would\r\nbe a philosopher worth looking at, who would assert that they were\r\nequally adequate for the transmission of the same arrow from points\r\nremoved, not by a hundred yards, but by a hundred miles. And such,\r\nbut still more glaring, has been the error of Lamarck. Fie has argued\r\non this principle of improvement and adaptation--which, carry it as\r\nfar as we rationally may, still leaves the vegetable a vegetable, and\r\nthe dog a dog--that, in the vast course of ages, inferior have risen\r\ninto superior natures, and lower into higher races; that molluscs and\r\nzoöphytes have passed into fish and reptiles, and fish and reptiles\r\ninto birds and quadrupeds; that unformed, gelatinous bodies, with an\r\norganization scarcely traceable, have been metamorphosed into oaks\r\nand cedars; and that monkeys and apes have been transformed into\r\nhuman creatures, capable of understanding and admiring the theories\r\nof Lamarck. Assuredly there is no lack of faith among infidels;\r\ntheir \"vaulting\" credulity o'erleaps revelation, and \"falls on the\r\nother side.\" One of the first geological works I ever read was a\r\nphilosophical romance, entitled _Telliamed_, by a M. Maillet, an\r\ningenious Frenchman of the days of Louis XV. This Maillet was by\r\nmuch too great a philosopher to credit the scriptural account of\r\nNoah's flood; and yet he could believe, like Lamarck, that the whole\r\nfamily of birds had existed at one time as fishes, which, on being\r\nthrown ashore by the waves, had got feathers by accident; and that\r\nmen themselves are but the descendants of a tribe of sea-monsters,\r\nwho, tiring of their proper element, crawled up the beach one sunny\r\nmorning, and, taking a fancy to the land, forgot to return.[H]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: Few men could describe better than Maillet. His\r\nextravagances are as amusing as those of a fairy tale, and quite as\r\nextreme. Take the following extract as an instance:--\r\n\r\n\"Winged or flying fish, stimulated by the desire of prey, or the\r\nfear of death, or pushed near the shore by the billows, have fallen\r\namong reeds or herbage, whence it was not possible for them to resume\r\ntheir flight to the sea, by means of which they had contracted\r\ntheir first facility of flying. Then their fins, being no longer\r\nbathed in the sea-water, were split, and became warped by their\r\ndryness. While they found, among the reeds and herbage among which\r\nthey fell, any aliments to support them, the vessels of their fins,\r\nbeing separated, were lengthened and clothed with beards, or, to\r\nspeak more justly, the membranes, which before kept them adherent\r\nto each other, were metamorphosed. The beard formed of these warped\r\nmembranes was lengthened. The skin of these animals was insensibly\r\ncovered with a down of the same color with the skin, and this down\r\ngradually increased. The little wings they had under their belly,\r\nand which, like their wings, helped them to walk in the sea, became\r\nfeet, and served them to walk on land. There were also other small\r\nchanges in their figure. The beak and neck of some were lengthened,\r\nand those of others shortened. The conformity, however, of the first\r\nfigure subsists in the whole, and it will be always easy to know it.\r\nExamine all the species of fowls, large and small, even those of\r\nthe Indies, those which are tufted or not, those whose feathers are\r\nreversed, such as we see at Damietta--that is to say, whose plumage\r\nruns from the tail to the head--and you will find species of fish\r\nquite similar, scaly or without scales. All species of parrots, whose\r\nplumages are so different, the rarest and the most singular-marked\r\nbirds, are, conformable to fact, painted like them with black, brown,\r\ngray, yellow, green, red, violet color, and those of gold and azure;\r\nand all this precisely in the same parts where the plumages of those\r\nbirds are diversified in so curious a manner.\"--_Telliamed_, p. 224,\r\ned. 1750.]\r\n\r\n\"How easy,\" says this fanciful writer, \"is it to conceive the change\r\nof a winged fish, flying at times through the water, at times through\r\nthe air, into a bird flying always through the air!\" It is a law of\r\nnature, that the chain of being, from the lowest to the highest form\r\nof life, should be, in some degree, a continuous chain; that the\r\nvarious classes of existence should shade into one another, so that\r\nit often proves a matter of no little difficulty to point out the\r\nexact line of demarcation where one class or family ends, and another\r\nclass or family begins. The naturalist passes from the vegetable\r\nto the animal tribes, scarcely aware, amid the perplexing forms of\r\nintermediate existence, at what point he quits the precincts of the\r\none to enter on those of the other. All the animal families have, in\r\nlike manner, their connecting links; and it is chiefly out of these\r\nthat writers such as Lamarck and Maillet construct their system.\r\nThey confound gradation with progress. Geoffrey Hudson was a very\r\nshort man, and Goliath of Gath a very tall one, and the gradations\r\nof the human stature lie between. But gradation is not progress; and\r\nthough we find full-grown men of five feet, five feet six inches, six\r\nfeet, and six feet and a half, the fact gives us no earnest whatever\r\nthat the race is rising in stature, and that at some future period\r\nthe average height of the human family will be somewhat between ten\r\nand eleven feet. And equally unsolid is the argument, that from a\r\nprinciple of gradation in races would deduce a principle of progress\r\nin races. The tall man of six feet need entertain quite as little\r\nhope of rising into eleven feet as the short man of five; nor has the\r\nfish that occasionally flies any better chance of passing into a bird\r\nthan the fish that only swims.\r\n\r\nGeology abounds with creatures of the intermediate class: there\r\nare none of its links more numerous than its connecting links; and\r\nhence its interest, as a field of speculation, to the assertors of\r\nthe transmutation of races. But there is a fatal incompleteness in\r\nthe evidence, that destroys its character as such. It supplies in\r\nabundance those links of generic connection, which, as it were,\r\nmarry together dissimilar races; but it furnishes no genealogical\r\nlink to show that the existences of one race derive their lineage\r\nfrom the existences of another. The scene shifts, as we pass from\r\nformation to formation; we are introduced in each to a new _dramatis\r\npersonæ_; and there exist no such proofs of their being at once\r\ndifferent and yet the same, as those produced in the _Winter's Tale_,\r\nto show that the grown shepherdess of the one scene is identical with\r\nthe exposed infant of the scene that went before. Nay, the reverse\r\nis well nigh as strikingly the case, as if the grown shepherdess had\r\nbeen introduced into the earlier scenes of the drama, and the child\r\ninto its concluding scenes.\r\n\r\nThe argument is a very simple one. Of all the vertebrata, fishes\r\nrank lowest, and in geological history appear first. We find their\r\nremains in the Upper and Lower Silurians, in the Lower, Middle,\r\nand Upper Old Red Sandstone, in the Mountain Limestone, and in\r\nthe Coal Measures; and in the latter formation the first reptiles\r\nappear. Fishes seem to have been the master existences of two great\r\nsystems, mayhap of three, ere the age of reptiles began. Now fishes\r\ndiffer very much among themselves: some rank nearly as low as worms,\r\nsome nearly as high as reptiles; and if fish could have risen into\r\nreptiles, and reptiles into mammalia, we would necessarily expect to\r\nfind lower orders of fish passing into higher, and taking precedence\r\nof the higher in their appearance in point of time, just as in the\r\n_Winter's Tale_ we see the infant preceding the adult. If such be\r\nnot the case--if fish made their first appearance, not in their\r\nleast perfect, but in their most perfect state--not in their nearest\r\napproximation to the worm, but in their nearest approximation to\r\nthe reptile--there is no room for progression, and the argument\r\nfalls. Now it is a geological fact, that it is fish of the higher\r\norders that appear first on the stage, and that they are found to\r\noccupy exactly the same level during the vast period represented by\r\nfive succeeding formations. There is no progression. If fish rose\r\ninto reptiles, it must have been by sudden transformation--it must\r\nhave been as if a man who had stood still for half a lifetime should\r\nbestir himself all at once, and take seven leagues at a stride. There\r\nis no getting rid of miracle in the case--there is no alternative\r\nbetween creation and metamorphosis. The infidel substitutes\r\nprogression for Deity; Geology robs him of his god.\r\n\r\nBut no man who enters the geological field in quest of the wonderful,\r\nneed pass in pursuit of his object from the true to the fictitious.\r\nDoes the reader remember how, in Milton's sublime figure, the body\r\nof Truth is represented as hewn in pieces, and her limbs scattered\r\nover distant regions, and how her friends and disciples have to\r\ngo wandering all over the world in quest of them? There is surely\r\nsomething very wonderful in the fact, that, in uniting the links\r\nof the chain of creation into an unbroken whole, we have in like\r\nmanner to seek for them all along the scale of the geologist;--some\r\nwe discover among the tribes first annihilated--some among the\r\ntribes that perished at a later period--some among the existences\r\nof the passing time. We find the present incomplete without the\r\npast--the recent without the extinct. There are marvellous analogies\r\nwhich pervade the scheme of Providence, and unite, as it were,\r\nits lower with its higher parts. The perfection of the works of\r\nDeity is a perfection entire in its components; and yet these are\r\nnot contemporaneous, but successive: it is a perfection which\r\nincludes the dead as well as the living, and bears relation, in its\r\ncompleteness, not to time, but to eternity.\r\n\r\nWe find the organisms of the Old Red Sandstone supplying an important\r\nlink, or, rather, series of links, in the ichthyological scale,\r\nwhich are wanting in the present creation, and the absence of which\r\nevidently occasions a wide gap between the two grand divisions\r\nor series of fishes--the bony and the cartilaginous. Of this,\r\nhowever, more anon. Of all the organisms of the system, one of the\r\nmost extraordinary, and the one in which Lamarck would have most\r\ndelighted, is the _Pterichthys_, or winged fish, an ichthyolite which\r\nthe writer had the pleasure of introducing to the acquaintance of\r\ngeologists nearly three years ago, but which he first laid open to\r\nthe light about seven years earlier. Had Lamarck been the discoverer,\r\nhe would unquestionably have held that he had caught a fish almost\r\nin the act of wishing itself into a bird. There are wings which want\r\nonly feathers, a body which seems to have been as well adapted for\r\npassing through the air as the water, and a tail by which to steer.\r\nAnd yet there are none of the fossils of the Old Red Sandstone which\r\nless resemble any thing that now exists than its _Pterichthys_. I\r\nfain wish I could communicate to the reader the feeling with which I\r\ncontemplated my first-found specimen. It opened with a single blow\r\nof the hammer; and there, on a ground of light-colored limestone,\r\nlay the effigy of a creature fashioned apparently out of jet, with a\r\nbody covered with plates, two powerful looking arms, articulated at\r\nthe shoulders, a head as entirely lost in the trunk as that of the\r\nray or the sun-fish, and a long, angular tail. My first-formed idea\r\nregarding it was, that I had discovered a connecting link between\r\nthe tortoise and the fish--the body much resembles that of a small\r\nturtle; and why, I asked, if one formation gives us sauroid fishes,\r\nmay not another give us chelonian ones? or if in the Lias we find\r\nthe body of the lizard mounted on the paddles of the whale, why not\r\nfind in the Old Red Sandstone the body of the tortoise mounted in\r\na somewhat similar manner? The idea originated in error; but as it\r\nwas an error which not many naturalists could have corrected at the\r\ntime, it may be deemed an excusable one, more especially by such of\r\nmy readers as may have seen well-preserved specimens of the creature,\r\nor who examine the subjoined prints. (Nos. I. and II.) I submitted\r\nsome of my specimens to Mr. Murchison, at a time when that gentleman\r\nwas engaged among the fossils of the Silurian System, and employed\r\non his great work, which has so largely served to extend geological\r\nknowledge regarding those earlier periods in which animal life first\r\nbegan. He was much interested in the discovery: it furnished the\r\ngeologist with additional data by which to regulate and construct\r\nhis calculations, and added a new and very singular link to the\r\nchain of existence in its relation to human knowledge. Deferring to\r\nAgassiz, as the highest authority, he yet anticipated the decision\r\nof that naturalist regarding it, in almost every particular. I had\r\ninquired, under the influence of my first impression, whether it\r\nmight not be considered as a sort of intermediate existence between\r\nthe fish and the chelonian. He stated, in reply, that he could\r\nnot deem it referrible to any family of reptiles; that, if not a\r\nfish, it approached more closely to the Crustacea than to any other\r\nclass; and that he had little doubt Agassiz would pronounce it to\r\nbe an ichthyolite of that ancient order to which the _Cephalaspis_\r\nbelongs, and which seems to have formed a connecting link between\r\ncrustacea and fishes.[I] The specimens submitted to Mr. Murchison\r\nwere forwarded to Agassiz. They were much more imperfect than some\r\nwhich I have since disinterred; and to restore the entire animal from\r\nthem would require powers such as those possessed by Cuvier in the\r\npast age, and by the naturalist of Neufchatel in the present. Broken\r\nas they were, however, Agassiz at once decided from them that the\r\ncreature must have been a fish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: The aborigines of South. America deemed it wonderful\r\nthat the Europeans who first visited them should, without previous\r\nconcert, agree in reading after the same manner the same scrap of\r\nmanuscript, and in deriving the same piece of information from\r\nit. The writer experienced on this occasion a somewhat similar\r\nfeeling. His specimens seemed written in a character cramp enough\r\nto suggest those doubts regarding original meaning which lead to\r\nvarious readings; but the geologist and the naturalist agreed in\r\nperusing them after exactly the same fashion--the one in London, the\r\nother in Neufchatel. Such instances give confidence in the findings\r\nof science. The decision of Mr. Murchison I subjoin in his own\r\nwords--his numbers refer to various specimens of _Pterichthys_: \"As\r\nto your fossils 1, 2, 3, we know nothing of them here, (London,)\r\nexcept that they remind me of the occipital fragments of some of\r\nthe Caithness fishes. I do not conceive they can be referrible to\r\nany reptile; for, if not fishes, they more closely approach to\r\ncrustaceans than to any other class. I conceive, however, that\r\nAgassiz will pronounce them to be fishes, which, together with the\r\ncurious genus _Cephalaspis_ of the Old Red Sandstone, form the\r\nconnecting links between crustaceans and fishes. Your specimens\r\nremind one in several respects of the _Cephalaspis_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE I._]\r\n\r\nI have placed one of the specimens before me. Imagine the figure\r\nof a man rudely drawn in black on a gray ground, the head cut off\r\nat the shoulders, the arms spread at full, as in the attitude of\r\nswimming, the body rather long than otherwise, and narrowing from\r\nthe chest downwards, one of the legs cut away at the hip-joint, and\r\nthe other, as if to preserve the balance, placed directly under\r\nthe centre of the figure, which it seems to support. Such, at a\r\nfirst glance, is the appearance of the fossil. The body was of very\r\nconsiderable depth, perhaps little less deep proportionally from back\r\nto breast than the body of the tortoise; the under part was flat;\r\nthe upper rose towards the centre into a roof-like ridge; and both\r\nunder and upper were covered with a strong armor of bony plates,\r\nwhich, resembling more the plates of the tortoise than those of the\r\ncrustacean, received their accessions of growth at the edges or\r\nsutures. The plates on the under side are divided by two lines of\r\nsuture, which run, the one longitudinally through the centre of the\r\nbody, the other transversely, also through the centre; and they would\r\ncut one another at right angles, were there not a lozenge-shaped\r\nplate inserted at the point where they would otherwise meet. There\r\nare thus five plates on the lower or belly part of the animal. They\r\nare all thickly tubercled outside with wart-like prominences, (see\r\nPlate I., fig. 4;) the inner present appearances indicative of\r\na bony structure. The plates on the upper side are more numerous\r\nand more difficult to describe, just as it would be difficult to\r\ndescribe the forms of the various stones which compose the ribbed\r\nand pointed roof of a Gothic cathedral, the arched ridge or hump of\r\nthe back requiring, in a somewhat similar way, a peculiar form and\r\narrangement of plates. The apex of the ridge is covered by a strong\r\nhexagonal plate, fitted upon it like a cap or helmet, and which\r\nnearly corresponds in place to the flat central plate of the under\r\nside. There runs around it a border of variously formed plates, that\r\ndiminish in size and increase in number towards the head, and which\r\nare separated, like the pieces of a dissected map, by deep sutures.\r\nThey all present the tubercled surface. The eyes are placed in\r\nfront, on a prominence considerably lower than the roof-like ridge\r\nof the back; the mouth seems to have opened, as in many fishes, in\r\nthe edge of the creature's snout, where a line running along the\r\nback would bisect a line running along the belly; but this part\r\nis less perfectly shown by my specimens than any other. The two\r\narms, or paddles, are placed so far forward as to give the body a\r\ndisproportionate and decapitated appearance. From the shoulder to\r\nthe elbow, if I may employ the terms, there is a swelling, muscular\r\nappearance, as in the human arm; the part below is flattened, so\r\nas to resemble the blade of an oar, and terminates in a strong,\r\nsharp point. The tail--the one leg on which, as exhibited in one\r\nof my specimens, the creature seems to stand--is of considerable\r\nlength, more than equal to a third of the entire figure, and of an\r\nangular form, the base representing the part attached to the body,\r\nand the apex its termination. It was covered with small tubercled,\r\nrhomboidal plates, like scales, (see Plate I., fig. 3;) and where the\r\ninternal structure is shown, there are appearances of a vertebral\r\ncolumn, with rib-like processes standing out at a sharp angle. The\r\nichthyolite, in my larger specimens, does not much exceed seven\r\ninches in length; and I despatched one to Agassiz, rather more than\r\ntwo years ago, whose extreme length did not exceed an inch. Such\r\nis a brief, and, I am afraid, imperfect sketch of a creature whose\r\nvery type seems no longer to exist. But for the purposes of the\r\ngeologist, the descriptions of the graver far exceed those of the\r\npen, and the accompanying prints will serve to supply all that may\r\nbe found wanting in the text. Fig. 1, in Plate I., and fig. 2, in\r\nPlate II., are both restorations--the first of the upper, and the\r\nsecond of the under, part of the creature. It may, however, encourage\r\nthe confidence of the naturalist, who for the first time looks upon\r\nforms so strange, to be informed that Plate I., with its two figures,\r\nwas submitted to Agassiz during his recent brief stay in Edinburgh,\r\nand that he as readily recognized in it the species of the two kinds\r\nwhich it exhibits, as he had previously recognized the species of the\r\noriginals in the limestone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE II._]\r\n\r\nAgassiz, in the course of his late visit to Scotland, found six\r\nspecies of the _Pterichthys_[J]--three of these, and the wings of a\r\nfourth, in the collection of the writer. The differences by which\r\nthey are distinguished may be marked by even an unpractised eye,\r\nespecially in the form of the bodies and wings. Some are of a fuller,\r\nsome of a more elongated, form; in some the body resembles a heraldic\r\nshield, of nearly the ordinary shape and proportions; in others the\r\nshield stretches into a form not very unlike that of a Norway skiff,\r\nfrom the midships forward. In some of the varieties, too, the wings\r\nare long and comparatively slender; in others shorter, and of greater\r\nbreadth: in some there is an inflection resembling the bend of an\r\nelbow; in others there is a continuous swelling from the termination\r\nto the shoulder, where a sudden narrowing takes place immediately\r\nover the articulation. I had inferred somewhat too hurriedly, though\r\nperhaps naturally enough, that these wings, or arms, with their\r\nstrong sharp points and oar-like blades, had been at once paddles and\r\nspears--instruments of motion and weapons of defence; and hence the\r\nmistake of connecting the creature with the Chelonia. I am informed\r\nby Agassiz, however, that they were weapons of defence only, which,\r\nlike the occipital spines of the river bull-head, were erected in\r\nmoments of danger or alarm, and at other times lay close by the\r\ncreature's side; and that the sole instrument of motion was the tail,\r\nwhich, when covered by its coat of scales, was proportionally of a\r\nsomewhat larger size than the tail shown in the print, which, as in\r\nthe specimens from whence it was taken, exhibits but the obscure\r\nand uncertain lineaments of the skeleton. The river bull-head, when\r\nattacked by an enemy, or immediately as it feels the hook in its\r\njaws, erects its two spines at nearly right angles with the plates\r\nof the head, as if to render itself as difficult of being swallowed\r\nas possible. The attitude is one of danger and alarm; and it is a\r\ncurious fact, to which I shall afterwards have occasion to advert,\r\nthat in this attitude nine tenths of the _Pterichthys_ of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone are to be found. We read in the stone a singularly\r\npreserved story of the strong instinctive love of life, and of the\r\nmingled fear and anger implanted for its preservation--\"The champions\r\nin distorted postures threat.\" It presents us, too, with a wonderful\r\nrecord of violent death falling at once, not on a few individuals,\r\nbut on whole tribes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: Agassiz now reckons ten distinct species of\r\n_Pterichthys_--_P. arenatus_, _P. cancriformis_, _P. cornutus_, _P.\r\nmajor_, _P. Milleri_, P. latus, _P. oblongus_, _P. productus_, _P.\r\ntestudinarius_, and _P. hydrophilus_; of these, nine species belong\r\nto the Lower, and one--the _Pterichthys hydrophilus_--to the Upper\r\nOld Red Sandstone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE III._]\r\n\r\nNext to the _Pterichthys_ of the Lower Old Red I shall place its\r\ncontemporary the _Coccosteus_ of Agassiz, a fish which, in some\r\nrespects, must have somewhat resembled it. Both were covered with\r\nan armor of thickly tubercled bony plates, and both furnished\r\nwith a vertebrated tail. The plates of the one, when found lying\r\ndetached in the rock, can scarcely be distinguished from those of the\r\nother: there are the same marks, as in the plates of the tortoise,\r\nof accessions of growth at the edges--the same cancellated bony\r\nstructure within, the same kind of tubercles without. The forms of\r\nthe creatures themselves, however, were essentially different. I\r\nhave compared the figure of the _Pterichthys_, as shown in some of\r\nmy better specimens, to that of a man with the head cut off at the\r\nshoulders, one of the legs also wanting, and the arms spread to the\r\nfull. The figure of the _Coccosteus_ I would compare to a boy's kite.\r\n(See Plate III., fig. 1.) There is a rounded head, a triangular body,\r\na long tail attached to the apex of the triangle, and arms thin and\r\nrounded where they attach to the body, and spreading out towards\r\ntheir termination like the ancient one-sided shovel which we see\r\nsculptured on old tombstones, or the rudder of an ancient galley.[K]\r\nThe manner in which the plates are arranged on the head is peculiarly\r\nbeautiful; but I am afraid I cannot adequately describe them. A ring\r\nof plates, like the ring-stones of an arch, runs along what may\r\nbe called the hoop of the kite; the form of the keystone-plate is\r\nperfect; the shapes of the others are elegantly varied, as if for\r\nornament; and what would be otherwise the opening of the arch, is\r\nfilled up with one large plate, of an outline singularly elegant. A\r\nsingle plate, still larger than any of the others, covers the greater\r\npart of the creature's triangular body, to the shape of which it\r\nnearly conforms. It rises saddle-wise towards the centre: on the\r\nridge there is a longitudinal groove ending in a perforation, a\r\nlittle over the apex, (Plate III., fig. 2;) two small lateral plates\r\non either side fill up the base of the angle; and the long tail, with\r\nits numerous vertebral joints, terminates the figure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: I have since ascertained that these seeming arms or\r\npaddles were simply plates of a peculiar form.]\r\n\r\nDoes the reader possess a copy of Lyell's lately published elementary\r\nwork, edition 1838? If so, let him first turn up the description of\r\nthe Upper Silurian rocks, from Murchison, which occurs in page 459,\r\nand mark the form of the trilobite _Asaphus caudatus_, a fossil of\r\nthe Wenlock formation. (See _Sil. Sys._, Plate VII.) The upper part,\r\nor head, forms a crescent; the body rises out of the concave with a\r\nsweep somewhat resembling that of a Gothic arch; the outline of the\r\nwhole approximates to that of an egg, the smaller end terminating\r\nin a sharp point. Let him remark, further, that this creature was a\r\n_crustaceous_ animal, of the crab or lobster class, and then turn up\r\nthe brief description of the Old Red Sandstone in the same volume,\r\npage 454, and mark the form of the _Cephalaspis_, or buckler-head--a\r\n_fish_ of a formation immediately over that in which the remains\r\nof the trilobite most abound. He will find that the fish and the\r\ncrustacean are wonderfully alike. The fish is more elongated, but\r\nboth possess the crescent-shaped head, and both the angular and\r\napparently jointed body.[L] They illustrate admirably how two\r\ndistinct orders may meet. They exhibit the points, if I may so speak,\r\nat which the plated fish is linked to the shelled crustacean. Now,\r\nthe _Coccosteus_ is a stage further on; it is more unequivocally a\r\nfish. It is a _Cephalaspis_ with an articulated tail attached to the\r\nangular body, and the horns of the crescent-shaped head cut off.\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: Really jointed in the case of the trilobite; only\r\napparently so in that of the _Cephalaspis_. The body of the\r\ntrilobite, like that of the lobster, was barred by transverse,\r\noblong, overlapping plates, and between every two plates there was a\r\njoint; the body of the _Cephalaspis_, in like manner, was barred by\r\ntransverse, oblong, overlapping scales, between which there existed\r\nno such joints. It is interesting to observe how nature, in thus\r\nbringing two such different classes as fishes and crustacea together,\r\ngives to the higher animal a sort of pictorial resemblance to the\r\nlower, in parts where the construction could not be identical without\r\ninterfering with the grand distinctions of the classes.]\r\n\r\nSome of the specimens which exhibit this creature are exceedingly\r\ncurious. In one, a coprolite still rests in the abdomen; and a common\r\nbotanist's microscope shows it thickly speckled over with minute\r\nscales, the indigestible exuviæ of fish on which the animal had\r\npreyed. In the abdomen of another we find a few minute pebbles--just\r\nas pebbles are occasionally found in the stomach of the cod--which\r\nhad been swallowed by the creature attached to its food. Is there\r\nnothing wonderful in the fact, that men should be learning at this\r\ntime of day how the fishes of the Old Red Sandstone lived, and that\r\nthere were some of them rapacious enough not to be over nice in their\r\neating?\r\n\r\nThe under part of the creature is still very imperfectly known:\r\nit had its central lozenge-shaped plate, like that on the under\r\nside of the _Pterichthys_, but of greater elegance, (see Plate\r\nIII., fig. 3,) round which the other plates were ranged. \"What an\r\nappropriate ornament, if set in gold!\" said Dr. Buckland, on seeing\r\na very beautiful specimen of this central lozenge in the interesting\r\ncollection of Professor Traill of Edinburgh,--\"What an appropriate\r\nornament for a lady geologist!\" There are two marked peculiarities\r\nin the jaws of the _Coccosteus_, as shown in most of the specimens,\r\nillustrative of the lower part of the creature, which I have yet\r\nseen. The teeth, instead of being fixed in sockets, like those of\r\nquadrupeds and reptiles, or merely placed on the bone, like those of\r\nfish of the common varieties, seem to have been cut out of the solid,\r\nlike the teeth of a saw or the teeth in the mandibles of the beetle,\r\nor in the nippers of the lobster, (Plate III., fig. 4;) and there\r\nappears to have been something strangely anomalous in the position\r\nof the jaws--something too anomalous, perhaps, to be regarded as\r\nproven by the evidence of the specimens yet found, but which may\r\nbe mentioned with the view of directing attention to it. \"Do not\r\nbe deterred,\" said Agassiz, in the course of one of the interviews\r\nin which he obligingly indulged the writer of these chapters, who\r\nhad mentioned to him that one of his opinions, just confirmed by\r\nthe naturalist, had seemed so extraordinary that he had been almost\r\nafraid to communicate it,--\"Do not be deterred, if you have examined\r\nminutely, by any dread of being deemed extravagant. The possibilities\r\nof existence run so deeply into the extravagant, that there is\r\nscarcely any conception too extraordinary for nature to realize.\" In\r\nall the more complete specimens which I have yet seen, _the position\r\nof the jaws is vertical, not horizontal_; and yet the creature, as\r\nshown by the tail, belonged unquestionably to the vertebrata. Now,\r\nthough the mouths of the crustaceous animals, such as the crab and\r\nlobster, open vertically, and a similar arrangement obtains among the\r\ninsect tribes, it has been remarked by naturalists, as an invariable\r\ncondition of that higher order of animals distinguished by vertebral\r\ncolumns, that their mouths open horizontally. What I would remark as\r\nvery extraordinary in the _Coccosteus_--not, however, in the way of\r\ndirectly asserting the fact, but merely by way of soliciting inquiry\r\nregarding it--is, that it seems to unite to a vertebral column a\r\nvertical mouth, thus forming a connecting link between two orders of\r\nexistences, by conjoining what is at once their most characteristic\r\nand most dissimilar traits.[M]\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: These statements regarding the character of the teeth\r\nand the position of the jaws of the _Coccosteus_ have been challenged\r\nby very high authorities. I retain them, however, in this edition\r\nin their original form, as first made nearly six years ago. In at\r\nleast two of my specimens of Coccosteus the teeth and jaw form\r\nunequivocally but one bone--a result, it is not improbable, of some\r\nafter anchylosing process, but which still solicits inquiry as not\r\nyet definitely accounted for. The matter of fact in the case is\r\ncertainly one which should be determined, not analogically, but on\r\nits own proper evidence, as furnished by good specimens. As for\r\nthe remark regarding the probable position of the creature's jaws,\r\nit was ventured on at first, as the reader may perceive, with much\r\nhesitation, and must now be regarded as more doubtful than ever.\r\nIts repetition here, however, will, I trust, be regarded as simply\r\nindicative of a wish on the part of the writer, that the question\r\nbe kept open just a little longer, and that further examination\r\nbe made. There is certainly something very peculiar about the\r\nmouth of the Coccosteus not yet understood, and singularly formed\r\nplates, connected with it, which have not been introduced into any\r\nrestoration, and the use of which in the economy of the animal\r\nseem wholly unknown. [1850.--I have at length found a very perfect\r\nspecimen of the nether jaw of _Coccosteus_, and am prepared to show\r\nthat it was of a character altogether unique. It had its two groups\r\nof from six to eight teeth, (exactly where, in the human subject, the\r\nmolars are placed,) that seem to have acted on corresponding groups\r\nin the intermaxllaries, and two other groups of from three to five\r\nteeth placed at right angles with these, direct in the symphysis,\r\nand that seem to have acted on each other. But though these unique\r\nteeth of the symphysis formed a vertical line of mouth, it joined\r\non at right angles to a transverse line of the ordinary type, as\r\nthe upright stroke of the letter T joins on to the horizontal line\r\na-top.] Fourth Edition.]\r\n\r\nI am acquainted with four species of _Coccosteus_--_C. decipiens_,\r\n_C. cuspidatas_, _C. oblongus_, and a variety not yet named; and\r\nmany more species may yet be discovered.[N] Of all the existences of\r\nthe formation, this curious fish seems to have been one of the most\r\nabundant. In a few square yards of rock I have laid open portions of\r\nthe remains of a dozen different individuals belonging to two of the\r\nfour species, the _C. decipiens_ and _C. cuspidatus_, in the course\r\nof a single evening. None of the other kinds have yet been found at\r\nCromarty. These two differed from each other in the proportions\r\nwhich their general bulk bore to their length--slightly, too, in\r\nthe arrangement of their occipital plates. The _Coccosteus latus_,\r\nas the name implies, must have been by much a massier fish than the\r\nother; and we find the arch-like form of the plates which covered its\r\nhead more complete: the plate representing the keystone rests on the\r\nsaddle-shaped plate in the centre, and the plates representing the\r\nspring-stones of the arch exhibit a broader base. The accompanying\r\nprint (Plate III.) represents the _Coccosteus cuspidatus_. The\r\naverage length of the creature, including the tail, as shown in most\r\nof the Cromarty specimens, somewhat exceeded a foot. A few detached\r\nplates from Orkney, in the collection of Dr. Traill, must have\r\nbelonged to an individual of fully twice that length.\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: A fifth species has been named _C. maximus._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elfin-fish of Gawin Douglas.--The Fish of the Old Red Sandstone\r\nscarcely less curious.--Place which they occupied indicated\r\nin the present Creation by a mere Gap.--Fish divided into two\r\ngreat Series, the Osseous and Cartilaginous.--Their distinctive\r\nPeculiarities.--Geological Illustration of Dr. Johnson's shrewd\r\nObjection to the Theory of Soame Jenyns.--Proofs of the intermediate\r\nCharacter of the Ichthyolites of the Old Red Sandstone.--Appearances\r\nwhich first led the Writer to deem it intermediate.--Confirmation\r\nby Agassiz.--The _Osteolepis_.--Order to which this Ichthyolite\r\nbelonged.--Description.--_Dipterus._--_Diplopterus._--_Cheirolepis._\r\n--_Glyptolepis._\r\n\r\nHas the reader ever heard of the \"griesly fisch\" and the \"laithlie\r\nflood,\" described by that minstrel Bishop of Dunkeld \"who gave rude\r\nScotland Virgil's page?\" Both fish and flood are the extravagances\r\nof a poet's dream. The flood came rolling through a wilderness of\r\nbogs and quagmires, under banks \"dark as rocks the whilk the sey\r\nupcast.\" A skeleton forest stretched around, doddered and leafless;\r\nand through the \"unblomit\" and \"barrant\" trees\r\n\r\n    \"The quhissling wind blew mony bitter blast;\"\r\n\r\nthe whitened branches \"clashed and clattered;\" the \"vile water\r\nrinnand o'erheid,\" and \"routing as thonder,\" made \"hideous trubil;\"\r\nand to augment the uproar, the \"griesly fisch,\" like the fish of\r\neastern story, raised their heads amid the foam, and shrieked and\r\nyelled as they passed. \"The grim monsters fordeafit the heiring with\r\ntheir sellouts;\"--they were both fish and elves, and strangely noisy\r\nin the latter capacity; and the longer the poet listened, the more\r\nfrightened he became. The description concludes, like a terrific\r\ndream, with his wanderings through the labyrinths of the dead forest,\r\nwhere all was dry and sapless above, and mud and marsh below,\r\nand with his exclamations of grief and terror at finding himself\r\nhopelessly lost in a scene of prodigies and evil spirits. And such\r\nwas one of the wilder fancies in which a youthful Scottish poet of\r\nthe days of Flodden indulged, ere taste had arisen to restrain and\r\nregulate invention.\r\n\r\nShall I venture to say, that the ichthyolites of the Old Red\r\nSandstone have sometimes reminded me of the \"fisch of the laithlie\r\nflood?\" They were hardly less curious. We find them surrounded, like\r\nthese, by a wilderness of dead vegetation, and of rocks upcast from\r\nthe sea; and there are the foot-prints of storm and tempest around\r\nand under them. True, they must have been less noisy. Like the\r\n\"griesly fisch,\" however, they exhibit a strange union of opposite\r\nnatures. One of their families--that of the _Cephalaspis_--seems\r\nalmost to constitute a connecting link, says Agassiz, between fishes\r\nand crustaceans. They had, also, their families of sauroid, or\r\nreptile fishes--and their still more numerous families that unite the\r\ncartilaginous fishes to the osseous. And to these last the explorer\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone finds himself mainly restricted. The\r\nlinks of the system are all connecting links, separated by untold\r\nages from that which they connect; so that, in searching for their\r\nrepresentatives amid the existences of the present time, we find\r\nbut the gaps which they should have occupied. And it is essentially\r\nnecessary from this circumstance, in acquainting one's self with\r\ntheir peculiarities, to examine, if I may so express myself, the\r\nsides of these gaps,--the existing links at both ends to which the\r\nbroken links should have pieced,--in short, all those more striking\r\npeculiarities of the existing disparted families which we find\r\nunited in the intermediate families that no longer exist. Without\r\nsome such preparation, the inquirer would inevitably share the fate\r\nof the poetical dreamer of Dunkeld, by losing his way in a labyrinth.\r\nIn passing, therefore, with this object from the extinct to the\r\nrecent, I venture to solicit, for a few paragraphs, the attention of\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nFishes, the fourth great class in point of rank in the animal\r\nkingdom, and, in extent of territory, decidedly the first, are\r\ndivided, as they exist in the present creation, into two distinct\r\nseries--the osseous and the cartilaginous. The osseous embraces\r\nthat vast assemblage which naturalists describe as \"fishes properly\r\nso called,\" and whose skeletons, like those of mammalia, birds,\r\nand reptiles, are composed chiefly of a calcareous earth pervading\r\nan organic base. Hence the durability of their remains. In the\r\ncartilaginous series, on the contrary, the skeleton contains scarce\r\nany of this earth: it is a framework of indurated animal matter,\r\nelastic, semi-transparent, yielding easily to the knife, and, like\r\nall mere animal substances, inevitably subject to decay. I have\r\nseen the huge cartilaginous skeleton of a shark lost in a mass of\r\nputrefaction in less than a fortnight. I have found the minutest\r\nbones of the osseous ichthyolites of the Lias entire after the lapse\r\nof unnumbered centuries.\r\n\r\nThe two series do not seem to precede or follow one another in\r\nany such natural sequence as that in which the great classes of\r\nthe animal kingdom are arranged. The mammifer takes precedence of\r\nthe bird, the bird of the reptile, the reptile of the fish; there\r\nis progression in the scale--the arrangement of the classes is\r\nconsecutive, not parallel. But in this great division there is\r\nno such progression; the osseous fish takes no precedence of the\r\ncartilaginous fish, or the cartilaginous, as a series, of the\r\nosseous. The arrangement is parallel, not consecutive; but the\r\nparallelism, if I may so express myself, seems to be that of a longer\r\nwith a shorter line;--the cartilaginous fishes, though much less\r\nnumerous in their orders and families than the other, stretch farther\r\nalong the scale in opposite directions, at once rising higher and\r\nsinking lower than the osseous fishes. The cartilaginous order of the\r\nsturgeons,--a roe-depositing tribe, devoid alike of affection for\r\ntheir young, or of those attachments which give the wild beasts of\r\nthe forest partners in their dens,--may be regarded as fully abreast\r\nof by much the greater part of the osseous fishes, in both their\r\ninstincts and their organization. The family of the sharks, on the\r\nother hand, and some of the rays, rise higher, as if to connect the\r\nclass of fish with the class immediately above it--that of reptiles.\r\nMany of them are viviparous, like the mammalia--attached, it is said,\r\nto their young, and fully equal even to birds in the strength of\r\ntheir connubial attachments. The male, in some instances, has been\r\nknown to pine away and die when deprived of his female companion.[O]\r\nBut then, on the other hand, the cartilaginous fishes, in some of\r\ntheir tribes, sink as low beneath the osseous as they rise above them\r\nin others. The suckers, for instance, a cartilaginous family, are\r\nthe most imperfect of all vertebral animals; some of them want even\r\nthe sense of sight; they seem mere worms, furnished with fins and\r\ngills, and were so classed by Linnæus; but though now ascertained to\r\nbe in reality fishes, they must be regarded as the lowest link in the\r\nscale--as connecting the class with the class _Vermes_, just as the\r\nsuperior cartilaginous fishes may be regarded as connecting it with\r\nthe class _Reptilia_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: Some of the osseous fishes are also viviparous--the\r\n\"viviparous blenny,\" for instance. The evidence from which the\r\nsupposed affection of the higher fishes for their offspring has been\r\ninferred, is, I am afraid, of a somewhat equivocal character. The\r\nlove of the sow for her litter hovers, at times, between that of the\r\nparent and that of the epicure; nor have we proof enough, in the\r\npresent state of ichthyological knowledge, to conclude to which side\r\nthe parental love of the fish inclines. The connubial affections of\r\nsome of the higher families seem better established. Of a pair of\r\ngigantic rays (_Cephaloptera giorna_) taken in the Mediterranean,\r\nand described by Risso, the female was captured by some fishermen;\r\nand the male continued constantly about the boat, as if bewailing\r\nthe fate of his companion, and was then found floating dead.--See\r\nWilson's article Ichthyology, _Encyc. Brit._, seventh edition.]\r\n\r\nBetween the osseous and the cartilaginous fishes there exist some\r\nvery striking dissimilarities. The skull of the osseous fish is\r\ndivided into a greater number of distinct bones, and possesses more\r\nmovable parts, than the skulls of mammiferous animals: the skull of\r\nthe cartilaginous fish, on the contrary, consists of but a single\r\npiece, without joint or suture. There is another marked distinction.\r\nThe bony fish, if it approaches in form to that general type which we\r\nrecognize amid all the varieties of the class as proper to fishes,\r\nand to which, in all their families, nature is continually inclining,\r\nwill be found to have a tail branching out, as in the perch and\r\nherring, from the bone in which the vertebral column terminates;\r\nwhereas the cartilaginous fish, if it also approach the general type,\r\nwill be found to have a tail formed, as in the sturgeon and dog-fish,\r\non both sides of the hinder portion of the spine, but developed much\r\nmore largely on the under than on the upper side. In some instances,\r\nit is wanting on the upper side altogether. It may be as impossible\r\nto assign reasons for such relations as for those which exist\r\nbetween the digestive organs and the hoofs of the ruminant animals;\r\nbut it is of importance that they should be noted.[P] It may be\r\nremarked, further, that the great bulk of fishes whose skeletons\r\nconsist of cartilage have yet an ability of secreting the calcareous\r\nearth which composes bone, and that they are furnished with bony\r\ncoverings, either partial or entire. Their bones lie outside. The\r\nthorn-back derives its name from the multitudinous hooks and spikes\r\nof bone that bristle over its body; the head, back, and operculum of\r\nthe sturgeon are covered with bony plates; the thorns and prickles of\r\nthe shark are composed of the same material. The framework within is\r\na framework of mere animal matter; but it was no lack of the osseous\r\ningredient that led to the arrangement--an arrangement which we can\r\nalone refer to the will of that all-potent Creator, who can transpose\r\nhis materials at pleasure, without interfering with the perfection\r\nof his work. It is a curious enough circumstance, that some of the\r\nosseous fishes, as if entirely to reverse the condition of the\r\ncartilaginous ones, are partially covered with plates of cartilage.\r\nThey are bone within, and cartilage without, just as others are bone\r\nwithout and cartilage within.\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: Dr. Buckland, in his _Bridgewater Treatise_, assigns\r\nsatisfactory reasons for this construction of tail in sharks and\r\nsturgeons. Of the fishes of these two orders, he states, \"the former\r\nperform the office of scavengers, to clear the water of impurities,\r\nand have no teeth, but feed, by means of a soft, leather-like mouth,\r\ncapable of protrusion and contraction, on putrid vegetables and\r\nanimal substances at the bottom; and hence they have constantly to\r\nkeep their bodies in an inclined position. The sharks employ their\r\ntail in another peculiar manner--to turn their body, in order to\r\nbring their mouth, which is placed downwards beneath the head, into\r\ncontact with their prey. We find an important provision in every\r\nanimal, to give a position of ease and activity to the head during\r\nthe operation of feeding.\"--_Bridgewater Treatise_, p. 279, vol. i.,\r\nfirst ed.]\r\n\r\nBut how apply all this to the Geology of the Old Red Sandstone?\r\nVery directly. The ichthyolites of this ancient formation hold,\r\nas has been said, an intermediate place, unoccupied among present\r\nexistences, between the two series, and in some respects resemble\r\nthe osseous, and in some the cartilaginous tribes. The fact reminds\r\none of Dr. Johnson's shrewd objection to the theory embraced by\r\nSoame Jenyns in his _Free Inquiry_, and which was the theory also of\r\nPope and Bolingbroke. The metaphysician held, with the poet and his\r\nfriend, that there exists a vast and finely graduated chain of being\r\nfrom Infinity to nonentity--from God to nothing; and that to strike\r\nout a single link would be to mar the perfection of the whole.[Q]\r\nThe moralist demonstrated, on the contrary, that this chain, in\r\nthe very nature of things, must be incomplete at both ends--that\r\nbetween that which does, and that which does not exist, there must\r\nbe an infinite difference--that the chain, therefore, cannot lay\r\nhold on _nothing_. He showed, further, that between the greatest of\r\nfinite existences and the adorable Infinite there must exist another\r\nillimitable void--that the boundless and the bounded are as widely\r\nseparated in their natures and qualities as the existent and the\r\nnon-existent--that the chain, in short, cannot lay hold on Deity. He\r\nasserted, however, that not only is it thus incomplete at both ends,\r\nbut that we must regard it as well nigh as incomplete in many of its\r\nintermediate links as at its terminal ones; that it is already a\r\nbroken chain, seeing that between its various classes of existence\r\nmyriads of intermediate existences might be introduced, by graduating\r\nmore minutely what must necessarily be capable of infinite gradation;\r\nand that, to base an infidel theory on the supposed completeness of\r\nwhat is demonstrably incomplete, and on the impossibility of a gap\r\nexisting in what is already filled with gaps, is just to base one\r\nabsurdity on another.[R] Now, we find the Geology of what may be\r\ntermed the second age of vertebrated existence (for the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone was such) coming curiously in to confirm the reasonings\r\nof Johnson. It shows us the greater part of the fish of an entire\r\ncreation thus insinuated between two of the links of our own.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Q:\r\n\r\n   \"See, through this air, this ocean, and this earth,\r\n    All matter quick, and bursting into birth;\r\n    Above, how high progressive life may go!\r\n    Around, how wide! how deep extend below!\r\n    Vast chain of being! which from God began--\r\n    Nature's ethereal, human angel, man,\r\n    Beast, bird, fish, insect--what no eye can see,\r\n    No glass can reach; from Infinite to thee--\r\n    From thee to nothing. On superior powers\r\n    Were we to press, inferior might on ours;\r\n    Or in the full creation leave a void,\r\n    Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroyed:\r\n    From Nature's chain, whatever link you strike,\r\n    Tenth, or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.\"\r\n\r\n                                      _Essay on Man._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote R: The following are the well-stated reasonings of Dr.\r\nJohnson, a writer who never did injustice to an argument for want of\r\nwords to express it in:--\r\n\r\n\"The scale of existence from Infinity to nothing cannot possibly\r\nhave being. The highest being not infinite must be at an infinite\r\ndistance from Infinity. Cheyne, who, with the desire inherent\r\nin mathematicians to reduce every thing to mathematical images,\r\nconsiders all existence as a cone, allows that the basis is at an\r\ninfinite distance from the body, and in this distance between finite\r\nand infinite there will be room forever for an infinite series of\r\nindefinable existence.\r\n\r\n\"Between the lowest positive existence and nothing, whenever we\r\nsuppose positive existence to cease, is another chasm infinitely\r\ndeep, where there is room again for endless orders of subordinate\r\nnature, continued forever and ever, and yet infinitely superior to\r\nnonexistence.\r\n\r\n\"To these meditations humanity is unequal. But yet we may ask, not\r\nof our Maker, but of each other, since on the one side creation,\r\nwhenever it stops, must stop infinitely below infinity, and on the\r\nother infinitely above nothing, what necessity there is that it\r\nshould proceed so far either way--that being so high or so low should\r\never have existed. We may ask, but I believe no created wisdom can\r\ngive an adequate answer.\r\n\r\n\"Nor is this all. In the scale, wherever it begins or ends, are\r\ninfinite vacuities. At whatever distance we suppose the next order of\r\nbeings to be above man, there is room for an intermediate order of\r\nbeings between them; and if for one order, then for infinite orders,\r\nsince every thing that admits of more or less, and consequently all\r\nthe parts of that which admits them, may be infinitely divided;\r\nso that, as far as we can judge, there may be room in the vacuity\r\nbetween any two steps of the scale, or between any two points of the\r\ncone of being, for infinite exertion of infinite power.\"--_Review of\r\n\"A Free Inquiry.\"_]\r\n\r\nIt is now several years since I was first led to suspect that\r\nthe condition of the ichthyolites of the Old Red Sandstone was\r\nintermediate. I have alluded to the comparative indestructibility\r\nof the osseous skeleton, and the extreme liability to decay\r\ncharacteristic of the cartilaginous one. Of a skeleton in part\r\nosseous and in part cartilaginous, we must, of course, expect, when\r\nit occurs in a fossil state, to find the indestructible portions\r\nonly. And when, in every instance, we find the fossil skeletons\r\nof a formation complete in some of their parts, and incomplete in\r\nothers--the entire portions invariably agreeing, and the wanting\r\nportions invariably agreeing also--it seems but natural to conclude\r\nthat an original difference must have obtained, and that the\r\nexisting parts, which we can at once recognize as bone, must have\r\nbeen united to parts now wanting, which were composed of cartilage.\r\nThe naturalist never doubts that the shark's teeth, which he finds\r\ndetached on the shore, or buried in some ancient formation, were\r\nunited originally to cartilaginous jaws. Now, in breaking open all\r\nthe ichthyolites of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, with the exception\r\nof those of the two families already described, we find that some\r\nof the parts are invariably wanting, however excellent the state\r\nof preservation maintained by the rest. I have seen every scale\r\npreserved and in its place--one set of both the larger and smaller\r\nbones occupying their original position--jaws thickly set with\r\nteeth still undetached from the head--the massy bones of the skull\r\nstill unseparated--the larger shoulder-bone, on which the operculum\r\nrests, lying in its proper bed--the operculum itself entire--and all\r\nthe external rays which support the fins, though frequently fine\r\nas hairs, spreading out distinct as the fibres in the wing of the\r\ndragon-fly, or the woody nerves in an oak-leaf. In no case, however,\r\nhave I succeeded in finding a single joint of the vertebral column,\r\nor the trace of a single internal ray. No part of the internal\r\nskeleton survives, nor does its disappearance seem to have had any\r\nconnection with the greater mass of putrescent matter which must\r\nhave surrounded it, seeing that the external rays of the fins show\r\nquite as entire when turned over upon the body, as sometimes occurs,\r\nas when spread out from it in profile. Besides, in the ichthyolites\r\nof the chalk, no parts of the skeleton are better preserved than\r\nthe internal parts--the vertebral joints, and the internal rays.\r\nThe reader must have observed, in the cases of a museum of Natural\r\nHistory, preparations of fish of two several kinds--preparations\r\nof the skeleton, in which only the osseous parts are exhibited,\r\nand preparations of the external form, in which the whole body is\r\nshown in profile, with the fins spread to the full, and at least\r\nhalf the bones of the head covered by the skin but in which the\r\nvertebral column and internal rays are wanting. Now, in the fossils\r\nof the chalk, with those of the other later formations, down to the\r\nNew Red Sandstone, we find that the skeleton style of preparation\r\nobtains; whereas, in at least three fourths of the ichthyolites of\r\nthe Lower Old Red, we find only what we may term the external style.\r\nI had marked, besides, another circumstance in the ichthyolites,\r\nwhich seemed, like a nice point of circumstantial evidence, to give\r\ntestimony in the same line. The tails of all the ichthyolites, whose\r\nvertebral columns and internal rays are wanting, are unequally lobed,\r\nlike those of the dog-fish and sturgeon, (both cartilaginous fishes,)\r\nand the body runs on to nearly the termination of the surrounding\r\nrays. The one-sided condition of tail exists, says Cuvier, in no\r\nrecent osseous fish known to naturalists, except in the bony pike--a\r\nsauroid fish of the warmer rivers of America. With deference,\r\nhowever, to so high an authority, it is questionable whether, the\r\ntail of the bony pike should not rather be described as a tail set on\r\nsomewhat awry, than as a one-sided tail.\r\n\r\nAll these peculiarities I could but note as they turned up before me,\r\nand express, in pointing them out to a few friends, a sort of vague,\r\nbecause hopeless, desire, that good fortune might throw me in the\r\nway of the one man of all the world best qualified to explain the\r\nprinciple on which they occurred, and to decide whether fishes may be\r\nat once bony and cartilaginous. But that meeting was a contingency\r\nrather to be wished than hoped for--a circumstance within the\r\nbounds of the possible, but beyond those of the probable. Could the\r\nworking-man of the north of Scotland have so much as dreamed that he\r\nwas yet to enjoy an opportunity of comparing his observations with\r\nthose of the naturalist of Neufchatel, and of having his inferences\r\ntested and confirmed?\r\n\r\nThe opportunity did occur. The working-man did meet with Agassiz; and\r\nmany a query had he to put to him; and never, surely, was inquirer\r\nmore courteously entreated, or his doubts more satisfactorily\r\nresolved. The reply to almost my first question solved the enigma of\r\nnearly ten years' standing. And finely characteristic was that reply\r\nof the frankness and candor of a great mind, that can afford to make\r\nit no secret, that, in its onward advances on knowledge, it may know\r\nto-day what it did not know yesterday, and that it is content to\r\n\"gain by degrees upon the darkness.\" \"Had you asked me the question\r\na fortnight ago,\" said Agassiz, \"I could not have replied to it.\r\nSince then, however, I have examined an ichthyolite of the Old Red\r\nSandstone in which the vertebral joints are fortunately impressed\r\non the stone, though the joints themselves have disappeared, and\r\nwhich, exactly resembling the vertebra? of the shark, must have\r\nbeen cartilaginous.\" In a subsequent conversation, the writer\r\nwas gratified by finding most of his other facts and inferences\r\nauthenticated and confirmed by those of the naturalist. I shall\r\nattempt introducing to the reader the peculiarities, general and\r\nspecific, of the ichthyolites to which these facts and observations\r\nmainly referred, by describing such of the families as are most\r\nabundant in the formation, and the points in which they either\r\nresemble or differ from the existing fish of our seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE IV._]\r\n\r\nOf these ancient families, the _Osteolepis_, or bony-scale,\r\n(see Plate IV., fig. 1,) may be regarded as illustrative of the\r\ngeneral type. It was one of the first discovered of the Caithness\r\nfishes, and received its name in the days of Cuvier, from the\r\nosseous character of its scales, ere it was ascertained that it\r\nhad numerous contemporaries, and that to all and each of these the\r\nsame description applied. The scales of the fishes of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone, like the plates and detached prickles of the\r\npurely cartilaginous fishes, were composed of a bony, not of a\r\nhorny, substance, and were all coated externally with enamel. The\r\ncircumstance is one of interest.\r\n\r\nAgassiz, in his system of classification, has divided fishes into\r\nfour orders, according to the form of their scales; and his principle\r\nof division, though apparently arbitrary and trivial, is yet found\r\nto separate the class into great natural families, distinguished\r\nfrom one another by other and very striking peculiarities. One kind\r\nof scale, for instance, the placoid or broad-plated scale, is found\r\nto characterize all the cartilaginous fishes of Cuvier except the\r\nsturgeon;--it is the characteristic of an otherwise well-marked\r\nseries, whose families are furnished with skeletons composed of mere\r\nanimal matter, and whose gills open to the water by spiracles. The\r\nfish of another order are covered by ctenoid or comb-shaped scales,\r\nthe posterior margin of each scale being toothed somewhat like the\r\nedge of a saw or comb; and the order, thus distinguished, is found\r\nwonderfully to agree with an order formed previously on another\r\nprinciple of classification, the Acanthopterygii, or thorny-finned\r\norder of Cuvier, excluding only the smooth-scaled families of\r\nthis previously formed division, and including, in addition to\r\nit, the flat fish. A third order, the Cycloidean, is marked by\r\nsimple marginated scales, like those of the cod, haddock, whiting,\r\nherring, salmon, &c.; and this order is found to embrace chiefly\r\nthe Malacopterygii, or soft-finned order of Cuvier--an order to\r\nwhich all these well-known fish, with an immense multitude of others,\r\nbelong. Thus the results of the principle of classification adopted\r\nby Agassiz wonderfully agree with the results of the less simple\r\nprinciples adopted by Cuvier and the other masters in this department\r\nof Natural History. Now, it is peculiar to yet a fourth order, the\r\nGanoidean, or shining-scaled order, that by much the greater number\r\nof the genera which it comprises exist only in the fossil state. At\r\nleast five sixths of the whole were ascertained to be extinct several\r\nyears ago, at a time when the knowledge of fossil Ichthyology was\r\nmuch more limited than at present: the proportions are now found to\r\nbe immensely greater on the side of the dead. And this order seems to\r\nhave included all the semi-osseous, semi-cartilaginous ichthyolites\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone: the enamelled scale is the\r\ncharacteristic, according to Agassiz's principle of classification,\r\nof the existences that filled the gap so often alluded to as existing\r\nin the present creation. All their scales glitter with enamel: they\r\nbore to this order the relation that the cartilaginous fish bear\r\nto the Placoidean order, the thorny-finned fish to the Ctenoidean\r\norder, and the soft-finned fish to the Cycloidean order. It also\r\nincluded, with the semi-cartilaginous, the sauroid fish--those master\r\nexistences and tyrants of the earlier vertebrata; and both classes\r\nfind their representatives among the comparatively few ganoid fishes\r\nof the present creation; the one in the sturgeon family, which of\r\nall existing families approaches nearest in other respects to the\r\nextinct semi-cartilaginous fishes; the other in the sauroid genus\r\n_Lepidosteus_, to which the bony pike belongs. The head, back, and\r\nsides of the sturgeon are defended, as has been already remarked, by\r\nlongitudinal rows of hard osseous bosses--the bony pike is armed\r\nwith enamelled osseous scales, of a stony hardness. It seems a\r\nsomewhat curious circumstance, that fishes so unlike each other in\r\ntheir internal framework should thus resemble one another in their\r\nbony coverings, and in some slight degree in their structure of\r\ntail. One of the characteristics of sauroid fishes is the extreme\r\ncompactness and hardness of their skeleton.[S]\r\n\r\n[Footnote S: \"The sauroid or lizard-like fishes,\" says Dr. Buckland,\r\n\"combine in the structure, both of the bones and some of the soft\r\nparts, characters which are common to the class of reptiles. The\r\nbones of the skull are united by closer sutures than those of\r\ncommon fishes. The vertebræ articulate with the spinous processes\r\nof sutures, like the vertebræ of saurians; the ribs also articulate\r\nwith the extremities of the spinous process. The caudal vertebræ have\r\ndistinct chevron bones, and the general condition of the skeleton is\r\nstronger and more solid than in other fishes: the air bladder also\r\nis bifid and cellular, approaching to the character of lungs; and in\r\nthe throat there is a glottis, as in sirens and salamanders, and many\r\nsaurians.\"--Note to _Bridgewater Treatise_, p. 274, first edit.]\r\n\r\nIt requires skill such as that possessed by Agassiz, to determine\r\nthat the uncouth _Coccosteus_, or the equally uncouth _Pterichthys_,\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone, with their long articulated tails and\r\ntortoise-like plates, were _bona fide_ fishes; but there is no\r\npossibility of mistaking the _Osteolepis_: it is obvious to the least\r\npractised eye that it must have been a fish, and a handsome one. Even\r\na cursory examination, however, shows very striking peculiarities,\r\nwhich are found, on further examination, to characterize not this\r\nfamily alone, but at least one half the contemporary families\r\nbesides. We are accustomed to see vertebrated animals with the bone\r\nuncovered in one part only,--that part the teeth,--and with the rest\r\nof the skeleton wrapped up in flesh and skin. Among the reptiles,\r\nwe find a few exceptions; but a creature with a skull as naked as\r\nits teeth,--the bone being merely covered, as in these, by a hard,\r\nshining enamel,--and with toes also of bare enamelled bone, would\r\nbe deemed an anomaly in creation. And yet such was the condition\r\nof the _Osteolepis_, and many of its contemporaries. The enamelled\r\nteeth were placed in jaws which presented outside a surface as naked\r\nand as finely enamelled as their own. (See Plate IV., fig. 5.) The\r\nentire head was covered with enamelled osseous plates, furnished\r\ninside like other bones, as shown by their cellular construction,\r\nwith their nourishing blood vessels, and perhaps their oil, and\r\nwhich rested apparently on the cartilaginous box, which must have\r\nenclosed the brain, and connected it with the vertebral column.\r\nI cannot better illustrate the peculiar condition of the fins of\r\nthis ichthyolite than by the webbed foot of a water-fowl. The web\r\nor membrane in all the aquatic birds with which we are acquainted\r\nnot only connects, but also covers the toes. The web or membrane in\r\nthe fins of existing fishes accomplishes a similar purpose; it both\r\nconnects and covers the supporting bones or rays. Imagine, however, a\r\nwebbed foot in which the toes--connected, but not covered--present,\r\nas in skeletons, an upper and under surface of naked bone; and a very\r\ncorrect idea may be formed, from such a foot, of the condition of fin\r\nwhich obtained among at least one half the ichthyolites of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone. The supporting bones or rays seem to have been\r\nconnected laterally by the membrane; but on both sides they presented\r\nbony and finely enamelled surfaces. (See Plate IV., fig. 6.) In this\r\nsingular class of fish, all was bone without, and all was cartilage\r\nwithin; and the bone in every instance, whether in the form of jaws\r\nor of plates, of scales or of rays, presented an external surface of\r\nenamel.\r\n\r\nThe fins are quite a study. I have alluded to the connecting\r\nmembrane. In existing fish this membrane is the principal agent\r\nin propelling the creature; it strikes against the water, as the\r\nmembrane of the bat's wing strikes against the air; and the internal\r\nskeleton serves but to support and stiffen it for this purpose.\r\nBut in the fin of the _Osteolepis_, as in those of many of its\r\ncontemporaries, we find the condition reversed. The rays were so\r\nnumerous, and lay so thickly, side by side, like feathers in the\r\nwing of a bird, that they presented to the water a surface of bone,\r\nand the continuous membrane only served to support and bind them\r\ntogether. In the fins of existing fish we find a sort of bat-wing\r\nconstruction; in those of the _Osteolepis_ a sort of bird-wing\r\nconstruction. The rays, to give flexibility to the organ which they\r\ncompose, were all jointed, as in the soft-finned fish--as in the\r\nherring, salmon, and cod, for example; and we find in all the fins\r\nthe anterior ray rising from the body in the form of an angular\r\nscale: it is a strong, bony scale in one of its joints, and a bony\r\nray in the rest. The characteristic is a curious one.\r\n\r\nIt is again necessary, in pursuing our description, to refer for\r\nillustration to the purely cartilaginous fishes. In at least all\r\nthe higher orders of these, furnished with movable jaws, such as\r\nthe sturgeon, the ray, and the shark, the mouth is placed far below\r\nthe snout. The dog-fish and thorn-back are familiar instances.\r\nFurther, the mouth in bony fishes is movable on both the upper and\r\nunder side, like the beak of the parrot; in the higher cartilaginous\r\nfishes it is movable, as in quadrupeds, on the under side only. In\r\nall their orders, too, except in that of the sturgeon, the gills\r\nopen to the water by detached spiracles, or breathing-holes; but\r\nin the sturgeon, as in the osseous fishes, there is a continuous\r\nlinear opening, shielded by an operculum, or gill-cover. In the\r\nOsteolepis the mouth opened below the snout, but not so far below\r\nit as in the purely cartilaginous fishes--not farther below it than\r\nin many of the osseous ones--than in the genus Aspro, for instance,\r\nor than in the genus Polynemus, or in even the haddock or cod. It\r\nwas thickly furnished with slender and sharply-pointed teeth. I have\r\nhitherto been unable fully to determine whether, like the mouths of\r\nthe osseous fishes, it was movable on both sides; though, from the\r\nperfect form of what seems to be the intermaxillary bone, I cannot\r\navoid thinking it was. The gills opened, as in the osseous fishes, in\r\ncontinuous lines, and were covered by large bony opercules--that on\r\nthe enamelled side somewhat resemble round japanned shields.\r\n\r\nBut while the head of the _Osteolepis_, with its appendages, thus\r\nresembled, in some points, the heads of the bony fishes, the tail,\r\nlike those of most of its contemporaries, differed in no respect\r\nfrom the tails of cartilaginous ones, such as the sturgeon. The\r\nvertebral column seems to have run on to well nigh the extremity\r\nof the caudal fin, which we find developed chiefly on the under\r\nside. The tail was a one-sided tail. Take into account with these\r\npeculiarities--peculiarities such as the naked skull, jaws, and\r\noperculum, the naked and thickly-set rays, and the unequally\r\nlobed condition of tail--a body covered with scales, that glitter\r\nlike sheets of mica, and assume, according to their position, the\r\nparallelogramical, rhomboidal, angular, or polygonal form--a lateral\r\nline raised, not depressed--a raised bar on the inner or bony side\r\nof the scales, which, like the doubled-up end of a tile, seems\r\nto have served the purpose of fastening them in their places--a\r\ngeneral clustering of alternate fins towards the tail--and the\r\n_tout ensemble_ must surely impart to the reader the idea of a very\r\nsingular little fish. The ventral fins front the space which occurs\r\nbetween the two dorsals, and the anal fin the space which intervenes\r\nbetween the posterior dorsal fin and the tail. The length of the\r\n_Osteolepis_, in my larger specimens, somewhat exceeds a foot; in the\r\nsmaller, it falls short of six inches. There exist at least three\r\nspecies of this ichthyolite, distinguished chiefly, in two of the\r\ninstances, by the smaller and larger size of their scales, compared\r\nwith the bulk of their bodies, and by punctulated markings on the\r\nenamel in the case of the third. This last, however, is no specific\r\ndifference, but common to the entire genus, and to several other\r\ngenera besides. The names are, _Osteolepis macrolepidotus_, _O.\r\nmicrolepidotus_, and _O. arenatus_.[T]\r\n\r\n[Footnote T: To these there have since been added _Osteolepis major_,\r\n_O. intermedius_, and _O. nanus_; the two latter, however, Agassiz\r\nregards as doubtful.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE V._]\r\n\r\nNext to the _Osteolepis_ we may place the _Dipterus_, or double-wing,\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone, an ichthyolite first introduced to\r\nthe knowledge of geologists by Mr. Murchison, who, with his friend,\r\nMr. Sedgwick, figured and described it in a masterly paper on the\r\nolder sedimentary formations of the north of Scotland, which appeared\r\nin the _Transactions of the Geological Society of London_ for 1828.\r\nThe name, derived from its two dorsals, would suit equally well,\r\nlike that of the Osteolepis, many of its more recently discovered\r\ncontemporaries. From the latter ichthyolite it differed chiefly in\r\nthe position of its fins, which were opposite, not alternate; the\r\ndouble dorsals exactly fronting the anal and ventral fins. (See Plate\r\nV., fig. 1.) The _Diplopterus_, a nearly resembling ichthyolite of\r\nthe same formation, also owes its name to the order and arrangement\r\nof its fins, which, like those of the _Dipterus_, were placed\r\nfronting each other, and in pairs. But the head, in proportion to\r\nthe body, was in greater size than in either the _Dipterus_ or\r\n_Osteolepis_; and the mouth, as indicated by the creature's length\r\nof jaw, must have been of much greater width. In their more striking\r\ncharacteristics, however, the three genera seem to have nearly\r\nagreed. In all alike, scales of bone glisten with enamel; their jaws,\r\nenamel without and bone within, bristle thick with sharp-pointed\r\nteeth; closely-jointed plates, burnished like ancient helmets, cover\r\ntheir heads, and seem to have formed a kind of outer table to skulls\r\nexternally of bone and internally of cartilage; their gill-covers\r\nconsist each of a single piece, like the gill-cover of the sturgeon;\r\ntheir tails were formed chiefly on the lower side of their bodies;\r\nand the rays of their fins, enamelled like their plates and their\r\nscales, stand up over the connecting membrane, like the steel or\r\nbrass in that peculiar armor of the middle ages, whose multitudinous\r\npieces of metal were fastened together on a groundwork of cloth or\r\nof leather. All their scales, plates, and rays present a similar\r\nstyle of ornament. The shining and polished enamel is mottled with\r\nthickly-set punctures, or, rather, punctulated markings; so that a\r\nscale or plate, when viewed through a microscope, reminds one of the\r\ncover of a saddle. Some of the ganoid scales of Burdie House present\r\nsurfaces similarly punctulated.[U]\r\n\r\n[Footnote U: There exists, according to Agassiz, only a single\r\nspecies of _Dipterus--D. macrelepidotus_; whereas four species of\r\n_Diplopterus_ have been enumerated--_D. affinis_, _D. borealis_, _D.\r\nmacrocephalus_, and _D. Agassizii_. The existence of the last named,\r\nhowever, as a distinct species, is regarded as problematical by the\r\ndistinguished naturalist whose name has been affixed to it.]\r\n\r\nThe _Glyptolepis_, or carved scale, may be regarded as the\r\nrepresentative of a family of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, which,\r\ndiffering very materially from the genera described, had yet many\r\ntraits in common with them, such as the bare, bony skull, the\r\nbony scales, the naked rays, and the unequally sided condition of\r\ntail. The fins, which were of considerable length in proportion\r\nto their breadth of base, and present in some of the specimens\r\na pendulous-like appearance, cluster thick together towards the\r\ncreature's lower extremities, leaving the upper portion bare. There\r\nare two dorsals placed as in the _Dipterus_ and _Diplopterus_--the\r\nanterior directly opposite the ventral fin, the posterior directly\r\nopposite the anal. The tail is long and spreading;--the rays, long\r\nand numerously articulated, are comparatively stout at their base,\r\nand slender as hairs where they terminate. The shoulder-bones\r\nare of huge dimensions, the teeth extremely minute. But the most\r\ncharacteristic parts of the creature are the scales. They are of\r\ngreat size, compared with the size of the animal. An individual not\r\nmore than half a foot in length, the specimen figured, (see Plate\r\nV., fig. 2,) exhibits scales fully three eighth parts of an inch\r\nin diameter. In another more broken specimen there are scales a\r\nfull inch across, and yet the length of the ichthyolite to which\r\nthey belonged seems not to have much exceeded a foot and a half.\r\nEach scale consists of a double plate, an inner and an outer.\r\nThe structure of the inner is not peculiar to the family or the\r\nformation: it is formed of a number of minute concentric circles,\r\ncrossed by still minuter radiating lines--the one described, and\r\nthe other proceeding from a common centre. (See Plate V., fig. 5.)\r\nAll scales that receive their accessions of growth equally at their\r\nedges exhibit, internally, a corresponding character. The outer plate\r\npresents an appearance less common. It seems relieved into ridges\r\nthat drop adown it like sculptured threads, some of them entire,\r\nsome broken, some straight, some slightly waved, (see Plate V.,\r\nfig. 3;) and hence the name of the ichthyolite. The plates of the\r\nhead were ornamented in a similar style, but their threads are so\r\nbroken as to present the appearance of dotted lines, the dots all\r\nstanding out in bold relief. My collection contains three varieties\r\nof this family; one of them disinterred from out the Cromarty beds\r\nabout seven years ago, and the others only a little later, though\r\npartly from the inadequacy of a written description, through which I\r\nwas led to confound the _Osteolepis_ with the _Diplopterus_, and to\r\nregard the _Glyptolepis_ as the _Osteolepis_, I was not aware until\r\nlately that the discovery was really such; and under the latter name\r\nI described the creature in the Witness newspaper several weeks ere\r\nit had received the name which it now bears. It was first introduced\r\nto the notice of Agassiz, in Autumn last, by Lady Cumming of Altyre.\r\nThe species, however, was a different one from any yet found at\r\nCromarty.[V]\r\n\r\n[Footnote V: There are three species of _Glyptolepis_--_G. elegans_,\r\n_G. Leptopterus_, and _G. microlepidotus_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Cheirolepis_, or scaly pectoral, forms the representative of\r\nyet another family of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, and one which\r\nany eye, however unpractised, could at once distinguish from the\r\nfamilies just described. Professor Traill of the University of\r\nEdinburgh, a gentleman whose researches in Natural History have\r\nmaterially extended the boundaries of knowledge, and whose frankness\r\nin communicating information is only equalled by his facility in\r\nacquiring it, was the first discoverer of this family, one variety\r\nof which, the _Cheirolepis Traillii_, bears his name. The figured\r\nspecimen (Plate VI., fig. 1) Agassiz has pronounced a new species,\r\nthe discovery of the writer. In all the remains of this curious\r\nfish which I have hitherto seen, the union of the osseous with\r\nthe cartilaginous, in the general framework of the creature, is\r\nstrikingly apparent. The external skull, the great shoulder-bone,\r\nand the rays of the fins, are all unequivocally osseous; the\r\noccipital and shoulder-bones, in particular, seem of great strength\r\nand massiveness, and are invariably preserved, however imperfect\r\nthe specimen in other respects; whereas, even in specimens the most\r\ncomplete, and which exhibit every scale and every ray, however\r\nminute, and show unchanged the entire outline of the animal, not a\r\nfragment of the internal skeleton appears. The _Cheirolepis_ seems\r\nto have varied from fourteen to four inches in length. When seen in\r\nprofile, the under line, as in the figured variety, seems thickly\r\ncovered with fins, and the upper line well nigh naked. The large\r\npectorals almost encroach on the ventral fins, and the ventrals on\r\nthe anal fin; whereas the back, for two thirds the entire length\r\nof the creature, presents a bare rectilinear ridge, and the single\r\ndorsal, which rises but a little way over the tail, immediately\r\nopposite the posterior portion of the anal fin, is comparatively\r\nof small size. The tail, which, in the general condition of being\r\ndeveloped chiefly on the lower side, resembles the tails of all\r\nthe creature's contemporaries, is elegantly lobed. The scales, in\r\nproportion to the bulk of the body which they cover, are not more\r\nthan one twentieth the size of those of the _Osteolepis_. They are\r\nrichly enamelled, and range diagonally from the shoulder to the\r\nbelly in waving lines; and so fretted is each individual scale by\r\nlongitudinal grooves and ridges, that, on first bringing it under\r\nthe glass, it seems a little bunch of glittering thorns, though,\r\nwhen more minutely examined, it is found to be present somewhat\r\nthe appearance of the outer side of the deep-sea cockle, with its\r\nstrongly marked ribs and channels, the point in which the posterior\r\npoint terminates representing the hinge. (See Plate VI., fig. 2.) The\r\nbones of the head, enamelled like the scales, are carved into jagged\r\ninequalities, somewhat resembling those on the skin of the shark,\r\nbut more irregular. The sculpturings seem intended evidently for\r\neffect. To produce harmony of appearance between the scaly coat and\r\nthe enamelled occipital plates of bone, the surfaces of the latter\r\nare relieved, where they border on the shoulders, into what seem\r\nscales, just as the dead walls of a building are sometimes, for the\r\nsake of uniformity, wrought into blind windows. The enamelled rays of\r\nthe fins are finished, if I may so speak, after the same style. They\r\nlie thick upon one another as the fibres of a quill, and like these,\r\ntoo, they are imbricated on the sides, so that the edge of each seems\r\njagged into a row of prickles. (See Plate VI., fig. 3.) The jaws of\r\nthe Cheirolepis were armed with thickly-set sharp teeth, like those\r\nof its contemporaries, the _Osteolepis_ and _Diplopterus_.[W]\r\n\r\n[Footnote W: There have been five species of _Cheirolepis_\r\nenumerated--_C. Cummingiæ_, _C. splendens_, _C. Traillii_, _C.\r\nunilateralis_ and _C. Uragus_. The _Cheirolepis splendens_ and _C.\r\nunilateralis_ Agassiz regards as doubtful.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VI._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Classifying Principle, and its Uses.--Three groups\r\nof Ichthyolites among the Organisms of the Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone.--Peculiarities of the Third Group.--Its\r\nVarieties.--Description of the Cheiracanthus.--Of two unnamed\r\nFossils of the same Order.--Microscopic Beauty of these\r\nAncient Fish.--Various Styles of Ornament which obtain among\r\nthem.--The Molluscs of the Formation.--Remarkable chiefly for\r\nthe Union of Modern with Ancient Forms which they exhibit.--Its\r\nVegetables.--Importance and Interest of the Record which it furnishes.\r\n\r\nThere rests in the neighborhood of Cromarty, on the upper stratum\r\nof one of the richest ichthyolite beds I have yet seen, a huge\r\nwater-rolled boulder of granitic gneiss, which must have been a\r\ntraveller, in some of the later periods of geological change, from\r\na mountain range in the interior highlands of Ross-shire, more\r\nthan sixty miles away. It is an uncouth looking mass, several tons\r\nin weight, with a flat upper surface, like that of a table; and\r\nas a table, when engaged in collecting my specimens, I have often\r\nfound occasion to employ it. I have covered it over, times without\r\nnumber, with fragments of fossil fish--with plates, and scales,\r\nand jaws, and fins, and, when the search proved successful, with\r\nentire ichthyolites. Why did I always arrange them, almost without\r\nthinking of the matter, into three groups? Why, even when the mind\r\nwas otherwise employed, did the fragments of the _Coccosteus_ and\r\n_Pterichthys_ come to occupy one corner of the stone, and those of\r\nthe various fish just described another corner, and the equally\r\nwell-marked remains of a yet different division a third corner?\r\nThe process seemed almost mechanical, so little did it employ the\r\nattention, and so invariable were the results. The fossils of the\r\nsurrounding bed always found their places on the huge stone in\r\nthree groups, and at times there was yet a fourth group added--a\r\ngroup whose organisms belonged not to the animal, but the vegetable\r\nkingdom. What led to the arrangement, or in what did it originate?\r\nIn a principle inherent in the human mind--that principle of\r\nclassification which we find pervading all science--which gives to\r\neach of the many cells of recollection its appropriate facts--and\r\nwithout which all knowledge would exist as a disorderly and shapeless\r\nmass, too huge for the memory to grasp, and too heterogeneous for\r\nthe understanding to employ. I have described but two of the groups,\r\nand must now say a very little about the principle on which, justly\r\nor otherwise, I used to separate the third, and on the distinctive\r\ndifferences which rendered the separation so easy.\r\n\r\nThe recent bony fishes are divided, according to the Cuvierian system\r\nof classification, into two great orders, the soft-finned and the\r\nthorny-finned order--the _Malacopterygii_ and the _Acanthopterygii_.\r\nIn the former the rays of the fins are thin, flexible, articulated,\r\nbranched: each ray somewhat resembles a jointed bamboo; with this\r\ndifference, however, that what seems a single ray at bottom,\r\nbranches out into three or four rays a-top. In the latter, (the\r\nthorny-finned order,)--especially in their anterior dorsal, and\r\nperhaps anal fins,--the rays are stiff continuous spikes of bone,\r\nand each stands detached as a spear, without joint or branch. The\r\nperch may be instanced as a familiar illustration of this order--the\r\ngold-fish of the other. Now, between the fins of two sets--shall I\r\nventure to say orders?--of the ichthyolites of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone, an equally striking difference obtains. The fin of the\r\n_Osteolepis_, with its surface of enamelled and minutely jointed\r\nbones, I have already described as a sort of bird-wing fin. The\r\nnaked rays, with their flattened surfaces, lay thick together as\r\nfeathers in the wing of a bird--so thick as to conceal the connecting\r\nmembrane; and fins of similar construction characterized the families\r\nof the _Dipterus_, _Diplopterus_, _Glyptolepis_, _Cheirolepis_,\r\n_Holoptychius_, and, I doubt not, many other families of the same\r\nperiod, which await the researches of future discoverers. But the\r\nfins of another set of ichthyolites, their contemporaries, may be\r\ndescribed as bat-wing fins: they presented to the water a broad\r\nexpanse of membrane; and the solitary ray which survives in each was\r\nnot a jointed, but a continuous spear-like ray. The fins of this set,\r\nor order, are thorny-fins, like those of the _Acanthopterygii_; the\r\nanterior edge of each, with the exception of, perhaps, the caudal\r\nfin, which differs in construction from the others, is composed of a\r\nstrong, bony spike. Such, with some tacit reference, perhaps, to the\r\nsimilar Cuvierian principle of classification, were the distinctive\r\ndifferences, on the strength of which I used to arrange two of my\r\ngroups of fossils on the granitic boulder; and the influence of the\r\nsame principle, almost instinctively exerted,--for, in writing the\r\nprevious pages, I scarce thought of its existence,--has, I find,\r\ngiven to each group its own chapter.\r\n\r\nOf the membranous-finned and thorny-rayed order of ichthyolites,\r\nthe _Cheiracanthus_, or thorny-hand, (_i. e._ pectoral,) may be\r\nregarded as an adequate representative. (See Plate VII., fig. 1.)\r\nThe _Cheiracanthus_ must have been an eminently handsome little\r\nfish--slim, tapering, and described in all its outlines, whether of\r\nthe body or the fins, by gracefully waved lines. It is, however,\r\na rare matter to find it presenting its original profile in the\r\nstone;--none of the other ichthyolites are so frequently distorted\r\nas the _Cheiracanthus_. It seems to have been more a cartilaginous\r\nand less an osseous fish than most of its contemporaries. However\r\nperfect the specimen, no part of the internal skeleton is ever found,\r\nnot even when scales as minute as the point of a pin are preserved,\r\nand every spine stands up in its original place. And hence, perhaps,\r\na greater degree of flexibility, and consequent distortion. The\r\nbody was covered with small angular scales, brightly enamelled, and\r\ndelicately fretted into parallel ridges, that run longitudinally\r\nalong the upper half of the scale, and leave the posterior portion\r\nof it a smooth, glittering surface. (See Plate VII., fig. 2.) They\r\ndiminish in size towards the head, which, from the faint stain left\r\non the stone, seems to have been composed of cartilage exclusively,\r\nand either covered with skin, or with scales of extreme minuteness.\r\nThe lower edge of the operculum bears a tagged fringe, like that of\r\na curtain. The tail, a fin of considerable power, had the unequal\r\nsided character common to the formation; and the slender and numerous\r\nrays on both sides are separated by so many articulations as to\r\npresent the appearance of parallelogramical scales. The other fins\r\nare comparatively of small size. There is a single dorsal placed\r\nabout two thirds the entire length of the creature adown the back;\r\nand exactly opposite its posterior edge is the anterior edge of the\r\nanal fin. The ventral fins are placed high upon the belly, somewhat\r\nlike those of the perch; the pectorals only a little higher. But\r\nit is rather in the construction of the fins, than their position,\r\nthat the peculiarities of the _Cheiracanthus_ are most marked. The\r\nanterior edge of each, as in the pectorals of the existing genera\r\n_Cestracion_ and _Chimæra_, is formed of a strong, large spine. In\r\nthe _Chimæra borealis_, a cartilaginous fish of the Northern Ocean,\r\nthe spine seems placed in front of the weaker rays, just, if I may\r\nbe allowed the comparison, as, in a line of mountaineers engaged in\r\ncrossing a swollen torrent, the strongest man in the party is placed\r\non the upper side of the line, to break off the force of the current\r\nfrom the rest. In the _Cheiracanthus_, however, each fin seems to\r\nconsist of but a single spine, with an angular membrane fixed to\r\nit by one of its sides, and attached to the creature's body on the\r\nother. Its fins are masts and sails--the spine representing the mast,\r\nand the membrane the sail; and it is a curious characteristic of\r\nthe order, that the membrane, like the body, of the ichthyolite, is\r\nthickly covered with minute scales. The mouth seems to have opened\r\na very little under the snout, as in the haddock; and there are no\r\nindications of its having been furnished with teeth.[X]\r\n\r\n[Footnote X: There have been three species of _Cheiracanthus_\r\ndetermined--_C. microlepidotus_, _C. minor_, and _C. Murchisoni_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VII._]\r\n\r\nAn ichthyolite first discovered by the writer about three years\r\nago, and introduced by him to the notice of Agassiz during his\r\nrecent visit to Edinburgh, but still unfurnished with a name,[Y]\r\nis a still more striking representative of this order than even\r\nthe _Cheiracanthus_. It must have been proportionally thick and\r\nshort, like some of the tropical fishes, though rather handsome\r\nthan otherwise. (See Plate VIII., fig. 1.) The scales, minute, but\r\nconsiderably larger than those of the _Cheiracanthus_, are of a\r\nrhomboidal form, and so regularly striated--the striæ converging\r\nto a point at the posterior termination of each scale--that, when\r\nexamined with a glass, the body appears as if covered with scallops.\r\n(See Plate VIII., fig. 3.) It seems a piece of exquisite shell-work,\r\nsuch as we sometimes see on the walls of a grotto. There are two\r\ndorsals--the posterior, immediately over the tail, and directly\r\nopposite the anal fin; the anterior, somewhat higher up than the\r\nventrals; and all the fins are of great size. The anterior edge of\r\neach is formed of a strong spine, round as the handle of a halbert,\r\nand diminishing gradually and symmetrically to a sharp point. Though\r\nformed externally of solid bone, it seems to have been composed\r\ninternally of cartilage, like the bones of some of the osseous\r\nfishes--those of the halibut, for instance; and the place of the\r\ncartilage is generally occupied in the stone by carbonate of lime.\r\nThe membrane which formed the body of the fin was covered, like that\r\nof the _Cheiracanthus_, with minute scales, of the same scallop-like\r\npattern with the rest, but of not more than one sixth the size\r\nof those which cover the creature's sides and back. Imagine two\r\nlug-sails stiffly extended between the deck of a brigantine and her\r\ntwo masts, the latter raking as far aft as to form an angle of sixty\r\ndegrees with the horizon, and some idea may be formed of the dorsals\r\nof this singular fish. They were lug-sails, formed not to be acted\r\nupon by the air, but to act upon the water. None of my specimens show\r\nthe head; but, judging from analogies furnished by the other families\r\nof the group, I entertain little doubt that it will be found to be\r\ncovered, not by bony plates, but by minute scales, diminishing, as\r\nthey approach the snout, into mere points. In none of the specimens\r\ndoes any part of the internal skeleton survive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Y: Now determined to be a species of _Diplacanthus_--_D.\r\nlongispinus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VIII._]\r\n\r\nMy collection contains the remains of yet another fish of this group,\r\nwhich was unfurnished with a name only a few months ago, but which I\r\nfirst discovered about five years since. (See Plate VIII., fig. 2.)\r\nIt is now designated the _Diplacanthus_; and, though the smallest\r\nichthyolite of the formation yet known, it is by no means the least\r\ncurious. The length from head to tail, in some of my specimens, does\r\nnot exceed three inches; the largest fall a little short of five. The\r\nscales, which are of such extreme minuteness that their peculiarities\r\ncan be detected by only a powerful glass, resemble those of the\r\n_Cheiracanthus_; but the ridges are more waved, and seem, instead\r\nof running in nearly parallel lines, to converge towards the apex.\r\nThere are two dorsals, the one rising immediately from the shoulder,\r\na little below the nape, the other directly opposite the anal fin.\r\nThe ventrals are placed near the middle of the belly. There is a\r\ncurious mechanism of shoulder-bone involved with a lateral spine and\r\nwith the pectorals. The creature, unlike the _Cheiracanthus_, seems\r\nto have been furnished with jaws of bone: there are fragments of bone\r\nupon the head, tubercled apparently on the outer surface; and minute\r\ncylinders of carbonate of lime running along all the larger bones,\r\nwhere we find them accidentally laid open, show that they were formed\r\non internal bases of cartilage. But the best marked characteristic\r\nof the creature is furnished by the spines of its fins, which are\r\nof singular beauty. Each spine resembles a bundle of rods, or,\r\nrather, like a Gothic column, the sculptured semblance of a bundle\r\nof rods, which finely diminish towards a point, sharp and tapering\r\nas that of a rush. (See Plate VIII., fig. 4.)[Z] The rest of the fin\r\npresents the appearance of a mere scaly membrane, and no part of the\r\ninternal skeleton appears. Perhaps this last circumstance, common\r\nto all the ichthyolites of the formation, if we except the families\r\nof the _Coccosteus_ and _Pterichthys_, may throw some light on the\r\napparently membranous condition of fin peculiar to the families\r\nof this order. What appears in the fossil a mere scaly membrane\r\nattached to a single spine of bone, may have had in the living\r\nanimal a cartilaginous framework, like the fins of the dog-fish and\r\nthorn-back, that are amply furnished with rays of cartilage--though,\r\nof course, all such rays must have disappeared in the stone, like the\r\nrest of the internal skeleton. Unquestionably, the caudal fin of the\r\ntwo last described fossils must have been strengthened by some such\r\ninternal framework; for, as they differ from the other fins, in being\r\nunprovided with osseous spines, they would have formed, without an\r\ninternal skeleton, mere pendulous attachments, altogether unfitted to\r\nserve the purposes of instruments of motion. There may be found in\r\nthe bony spines of all this order direct proof that, had there been\r\nan internal skeleton of bone, it would have survived. The spines run\r\ndeep into the body, as a ship's masts run deep into her hulk; and we\r\ncan see them standing up among the scales to their termination, in\r\nsuch bold relief, that, from a sort of pictorial illusion, they seem\r\nas if fixed to the creature's sides, and foreshortened, instead of\r\nrising in profile from its back or belly. (See Plate VIII., fig. 1.)\r\nThe observer will of course remember, that, in the living animal,\r\nthe view of the spine must have terminated with the line of the\r\nprofile, just as the view of a vessel's mast terminates with the\r\ndeck, though the mast itself penetrates to the interior keel. Now, it\r\nmust be deemed equally obvious, that, had the vertebral column been\r\nof bone, not of cartilage, instead of exhibiting no trace, even the\r\nfaintest, of having ever existed, it would have stood out in as high\r\nrelief as the internal buts or stocks of the spines. And such are the\r\ngeneral characteristics of a few of the ichthyolites of this lower\r\nformation of the Old Red Sandstone--a few of the more striking forms,\r\nsculptured, if I may so speak, on the middle compartment of the\r\nCaithness pyramid. It would be easy rendering the list more complete\r\nat even the present stage, when the field is still so new that almost\r\nevery laborer in it can exhibit genera and species unknown to his\r\nbrother laborers. The remains of a species of _Holoptychius_ have\r\nbeen discovered low in the formation, at Orkney, by Dr. Traill;\r\nsimilar remains have been found in it at Gamrie. In its upper beds\r\nthe specimens seem so different from those in the lower, that, in\r\nextensive collections made from the inferior strata of one locality,\r\nAgassiz has been unable to identify a single specimen with the\r\nspecimens of collections made from the superior strata of another,\r\nthough the genera are the same. Meanwhile there are heads and hands\r\nat work on the subject; Geology has become a Briareus; and I have\r\nlittle doubt that, in five years hence, this third portion of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone will be found to contain as many distinct varieties\r\nof fossil fish as the whole geological scale was known to contain\r\nfifteen years ago.[AA]\r\n\r\n[Footnote Z: Agassiz reckons four species of _Diplacanthus_--_D.\r\ncrassispinus_, _D. longispinus_, _D. striatulus_, and _D. striatus_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AA: This prediction has been already more than\r\naccomplished. At the death of Cuvier, in 1832, there were but\r\nninety-two species of fossil fish known to the geologist; Agassiz now\r\nenumerates one hundred and five species that belong to the Old Red\r\nSandstone alone; and if we include doubtful species, on which he has\r\nnot authoritatively decided--some of which, however, were included in\r\nthe list of Cuvier--one hundred and fifty-one.]\r\n\r\nThere is something very admirable in the consistency of style which\r\nobtains among the ichthyolites of this formation. In no single fish\r\nof either group do we find two styles of ornament--in scarce any\r\ntwo fishes do we find exactly the same style. I pass fine buildings\r\nalmost every day. In some there is a discordant jumbling--an\r\nEgyptian Sphinx, for instance, placed over a Doric portico; in all\r\nthere prevails a vast amount of timid imitation. The one repeats\r\nthe other, either in general outline or in the subordinate parts.\r\nBut the case is otherwise among the ichthyolites of the Old Red\r\nSandstone; nor does it lessen the wonder, that their nicer ornaments\r\nshould yield their beauty only to the microscope. There is unity of\r\ncharacter in every scale, plate, and fin--unity such as all men of\r\ntaste have learned to admire in those three Grecian orders from which\r\nthe ingenuity of Rome was content to borrow, when it professed to\r\ninvent--in the masculine Doric, the chaste and graceful Ionic, the\r\nexquisitely elegant Corinthian; and yet the unassisted eye fails to\r\ndiscover the finer evidences of this unity: it would seem as if the\r\nadorable Architect had wrought it out in secret with reference to\r\nthe Divine idea alone. The artist who sculptured the cherry-stone\r\nconsigned it to a cabinet, and placed a microscope beside it; the\r\nmicroscopic beauty of these ancient fish was consigned to the\r\ntwilight depths of a primeval ocean. There is a feeling which at\r\ntimes grows upon the painter and the statuary, as if the perception\r\nand love of the beautiful had been sublimed into a kind of moral\r\nsense. Art comes to be pursued for its own sake; the exquisite\r\nconception in the mind, or the elegant and elaborate model, becomes\r\nall in all to the worker, and the dread of criticism or the appetite\r\nof praise almost nothing. And thus, through the influence of a power\r\nsomewhat akin to conscience, but whose province is not the just\r\nand the good, but the fair, the refined, the exquisite, have works\r\nprosecuted in solitude, and never intended for the world, been found\r\nfraught with loveliness. Sir Thomas Lawrence, when finishing, with\r\nthe most consummate care, a picture intended for a semi-barbarous,\r\nforeign court, was asked why he took so much pains with a piece\r\ndestined, perhaps, never to come under the eye of a connoisseur. \"I\r\ncannot help it,\" he replied; \"I do the best I can, unable, through a\r\ntyrant feeling, that will not brook offence, to do any thing less.\"\r\nIt would be perhaps over bold to attribute any such overmastering\r\nfeeling to the Creator; yet certain it is, that among his creatures\r\nwell nigh all approximations towards perfection, in the province in\r\nwhich it expatiates, owe their origin to it, and that Deity in all\r\nhis works is his own rule.\r\n\r\nThe _Osteolepis_ was cased, I have said, from head to tail, in\r\ncomplete armor. The head had its plaited mail, the body its scaly\r\nmail, the fins their mail of parallel and jointed bars; the entire\r\nsuit glittered with enamel; and every plate, bar, and scale was\r\ndotted with microscopic points. Every ray had its double or treble\r\npunctulated row, every scale or plate its punctulated group; the\r\nmarkings lie as thickly in proportion to the fields they cover,\r\nas the circular perforations in a lace veil; and the effect,\r\nviewed through the glass, is one of lightness and beauty. In the\r\n_Cheirolepis_ an entirely different style obtains. The enamelled\r\nscales and plates glitter with minute ridges, that show like thorns\r\nin a December morning varnished with ice. Every ray of the fins\r\npresents its serrated edge, every occipital plate and bone its\r\nsculptured prominences, every scale its bunch of prickle-like ridges.\r\nA more rustic style characterized the _Glyptolepis_. The enamel of\r\nthe scales and plates is less bright; the sculpturings are executed\r\non a larger scale, and more rudely finished. The relieved ridges,\r\nwaved enough to give them a pendulous appearance, drop adown the\r\nhead and body. The rays of the fins, of great length, present also a\r\npendulous appearance. The bones and scales seem disproportionately\r\nlarge. There is a general rudeness in the finish of the creature,\r\nif I may so speak, that reminds one of the tattooings of a savage,\r\nor the corresponding style of art in which he ornaments the handle\r\nof his stone-hatchet or his war-club. In the _Cheiracanthus_, on\r\nthe contrary, there is much of a minute and cabinet-like elegance.\r\nThe silvery smoothness of the fins, dotted with scarcely visible\r\nscales, harmonized with a similar appearance of head; a style of\r\nsculpture resembling the parallel etchings of the line-engraver\r\nfretted the scales; the fins were small, and the contour elegant. I\r\nhave already described the appearance of the unnamed fossils--the\r\nseeming shell-work that covered the sides of the one--its mast-like\r\nspines and sail-like fins; and the Gothic-like peculiarities that\r\ncharacterized the other--its rodded, obelisk-like spines, and the\r\nexternal framework of bone that stretched along its pectorals.\r\n\r\nTill very lately, it was held that the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland\r\ncontained no mollusca. It seemed difficult, however, to imagine a sea\r\nabounding in fish, and yet devoid of shells. In all my explorations,\r\ntherefore, I had an eye to the discovery of the latter, and on two\r\nseveral occasions I disinterred what I supposed might have formed\r\nportions of a cardium or terebratula. On applying the glass, however,\r\nthe punctulated character of the surface showed that the supposed\r\nshells were but parts of the concave helmet-like plate that covered\r\nthe snout of the _Osteolepis_. In the ichthyolite beds of Cromarty\r\nand Ross, of Moray, Banff, Perth, Forfar, Fife, and Berwickshire, not\r\na single shell has yet been found; but there have been discovered of\r\nlate, in the upper beds of the Lower Old Red Sandstone in Orkney,\r\nthe remains of a small, delicate bivalve, not yet described or\r\nfigured, but which very much resembles a _Venus_. (See Plate V.,\r\nfig. 7.) In the Tilestones of England, so carefully described by\r\nMr. Murchison in his _Silurian System_, shells are very abundant;\r\nand the fact may now be regarded as established, that the Tilestones\r\nof England belong to a deposit contemporaneous with the ichthyolite\r\nbeds of Caithness and Cromarty. They occupy the same place low in\r\nthe base of the Old Red; and there is at least one ichthyolite\r\ncommon to both,[AB] and which does not occur in the superior strata\r\nof the system in either country--the _Dipterus macrolepidotus_. The\r\nevidence that the fish and shells lived in the same period, and\r\nrepresent, therefore, the same formation, may be summed up in a\r\nsingle sentence. We learn from the Geology of Caithness that this\r\nspecies of _Dipterus_ was unquestionably contemporary with all\r\nthe other ichthyolites described;--we learn from the Geology of\r\nHerefordshire that the shells were as unquestionably contemporary\r\nwith it.[AC] These--the shells--are of a singularly mixed character,\r\nregarded as a group, uniting, says Mr. Murchison, forms at one time\r\ndeemed characteristic of the more modern formations,--of the latter\r\nsecondary, and even tertiary periods,--with forms the most ancient,\r\nand which characterize the molluscous remains of the transition\r\nrocks. Turbinated shells and bivalves of well nigh the recent type\r\nmay be found lying side by side with chambered Orthoceratites and\r\nTerebratula.[AD]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AB: _Silurian System_, part ii. p. 599.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AC: In Russia, too, as shown by the recent discoveries of\r\nMurchison, the Old Red fishes of Caithness, and the Old Red shells of\r\nDevonshire, may be found lying embedded in the same strata.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AD: _Silurian System_, part i. p. 183.]\r\n\r\nThe vegetable remains of the formation are numerous, but obscure,\r\nconsisting mostly of carbonaceous markings, such as might be formed\r\nby comminuted sea-weed. (See Plate VII.) Some of the impressions\r\nfork into branches at acute angles, (see figs. 4, 5, and 6;) some\r\naffect a waved outline, (see figs. 7 and 8;) most of them, however,\r\nare straight and undivided. They lie in some places so thickly in\r\nlayers as to give the stone in which they occur a slaty character.\r\nOne of my specimens shows minute markings, somewhat resembling the\r\nbird-like eyes of the Stigmaria Ficoides of the Coal Measures;--the\r\nbranches of another terminate in minute hooks, that remind one of the\r\nhooks of the young tendrils of the pea when they first begin to turn.\r\n(See fig. 3.) In yet another there are marks of the ligneous fibre;\r\nwhen examined by the glass, it resembles a bundle of horse-hairs\r\nlying stretched in parallel lines; and in this specimen alone have\r\nI found aught approaching to proof of a terrestrial origin. The\r\ndeposition seems to have taken place far from land; and this lignite,\r\nif in reality such, had probably drifted far ere it at length became\r\nweightier than the supporting fluid, and sank.[AE] It is by no means\r\nrare to find fragments of wood that have been borne out to sea by the\r\ngulf stream from the shores of Mexico or the West Indian Islands,\r\nstranded on the rocky coasts of Orkney and Shetland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AE: The organism here referred to has been since slit by\r\nthe lapidary, and the sections carefully examined. It proves to be\r\nunequivocally a true wood of the coniferous class. The following\r\nis the decision regarding it of Mr. William Nicol, of Edinburgh,\r\nconfessedly one of our highest living authorities in that division\r\nof fossil botany which takes cognizance of the internal structure cf\r\nlignites, and decides from their anatomy their race and family:--\r\n\r\n                                     Edinburgh, 19th July, 1815.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir:--I have examined the structure of the fossil wood\r\n  which you found in the Old Red Sandstone at Cromarty, and have\r\n  no hesitation in stating, that the reticulated texture of the\r\n  transverse sections, though somewhat compressed, clearly indicates\r\n  a coniferous origin; but as there is not the slightest trace of\r\n  a disk to be seen in the longitudinal sections parallel to the\r\n  medullary rays, it is impossible to say whether it belongs to the\r\n  Pine or Araucarian division. I am, &c.,\r\n\r\n                                             William Nicol.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe dissimilarity which obtains between the fossils of the\r\ncontemporary formations of this system in England and Scotland, is\r\ninstructive. The group in the one consists mainly of molluscous\r\nanimals; in the other, almost entirely of ichthyolites, and what\r\nseems to have been algæ. Other localities may present us with yet\r\ndifferent groups of the same period--with the productions of its\r\ncoasts, its lakes, and its rivers. At present, we are but beginning\r\nto know just a little of its littoral shells, and of the fish of its\r\nprofounder depths. These last are surely curious subjects of inquiry.\r\nWe cannot catechise our stony ichthyolites, as the necromantic lady\r\nof the _Arabian Nights_ did the colored fish of the lake, which had\r\nonce been a city, when she touched their dead bodies with her wand,\r\nand they straightway raised their heads and replied to her queries.\r\nWe would have many a question to ask them if we could--questions\r\nnever to be solved. But even the contemplation of their remains is\r\na powerful stimulant to thought. The wonders of Geology exercise\r\nevery faculty of the mind--reason; memory, imagination; and though\r\nwe cannot put our fossils to the question, it is something to be\r\nso aroused as to be made to put questions to one's self. I have\r\nreferred to the consistency of style which obtained among these\r\nancient fishes--the unity of character which marked every scale,\r\nplate, and fin of every various family, and which distinguished it\r\nfrom the rest; and who can doubt that the same shades of variety\r\nexisted in their habits and their instincts? We speak of the infinity\r\nof Deity--of his inexhaustible variety of mind; but we speak of it\r\nuntil the idea becomes a piece of mere common-place in our mouths. It\r\nis well to be brought to feel, if not to conceive of it--to be made\r\nto know that we ourselves are barren-minded, and that in Him \"all\r\nfulness dwelleth.\" Succeeding creations, each with its myriads of\r\nexistences, do not exhaust Him. He never repeats Himself. The curtain\r\ndrops, at his command, over one scene of existence full of wisdom\r\nand beauty; it rises again, and all is glorious, wise, and beautiful\r\nas before, and all is new, Who can sum up the amount of wisdom\r\nwhose record He has written in the rocks--wisdom exhibited in the\r\nsucceeding creations of earth, ere man was, but which was exhibited\r\nsurely not in vain? May we not say with Milton,--\r\n\r\n    Think not, though men were none,\r\n    That heaven could want spectators, God want praise;\r\n    Millions of spiritual creatures walked the earth,\r\n    And these with ceaseless praise his works beheld?\r\n\r\nIt is well to return on the record, and to read in its unequivocal\r\ncharacters the lessons which it was intended to teach. Infidelity has\r\noften misinterpreted its meaning, but not the less on that account\r\nhas it been inscribed for purposes alike wise and benevolent. Is\r\nit nothing to be taught, with a demonstrative evidence which the\r\nmetaphysician cannot supply, that races are not eternal--that every\r\nfamily had its beginning, and that whole creations have come to an\r\nend?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lines of the Geographer rarely right Lines.--These last,\r\nhowever, always worth looking at when they occur.--Striking Instance\r\nin the Line of the Great Caledonian Valley.--Indicative of the\r\nDirection in which the Volcanic Agencies have operated.--Sections\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone furnished by the Granitic Eminences of\r\nthe Line.--Illustration.--Lias of the Moray Frith.--Surmisings\r\nregarding its Original Extent.--These lead to an Exploratory\r\nRamble.--Narrative.--Phenomena exhibited in the course of half an\r\nhour's Walk.--The little Bay.--Its Strata and their Organisms.\r\n\r\nThe natural boundaries of the geographer are rarely described by\r\nright lines. Whenever these occur, however, the geologist may\r\nlook for something remarkable. There is one very striking example\r\nfurnished by the north of Scotland. The reader, in consulting a map\r\nof the kingdom, will find that the edge of a ruler, laid athwart the\r\ncountry in a direction from south-west to north-east, touches the\r\nwhole northern side of the great Caledonian Valley, with its long,\r\nstraight line of lakes; and onwards, beyond the valley's termination\r\nat both ends, the whole northern side of Loch Eil and Loch Linnhe,\r\nand the whole of the abrupt and precipitous northern shores of the\r\nMoray Frith, to the extreme point of Tarbat Ness--a right line of\r\nconsiderably more than a hundred miles. Nor does the geography of the\r\nglobe furnish a line better defined by natural marks. There is both\r\nrampart and fosse. On the one hand we have the rectilinear lochs and\r\nlakes, with an average profundity of depth more than equal to that\r\nof the German Ocean, and, added to these, the rectilinear lines of\r\nfrith; on the other hand, with but few interruptions, there is an\r\ninclined wall of rock, which rises at a steep angle in the interior\r\nto nearly two thousand feet over the level of the Great Canal, and\r\noverhangs the sea towards its northern termination, in precipices of\r\nmore than a hundred yards.[AF]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AF: The valley of the Jordan, from the village of Laish\r\nto the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, furnishes another very\r\nremarkable instance of a geographical right line.]\r\n\r\nThe direction of this rampart and fosse--this Roman wall of Scottish\r\ngeological history--seems to have been that in which the volcanic\r\nagencies chiefly operated in upheaving the entire island from the\r\nabyss. The line survives as a sort of foot-track, hollowed by the\r\nfrequent tread of earthquakes, to mark the course in which they\r\njourneyed. Like one of the great lines in a trigonometrical survey,\r\nit enables us, too, to describe the lesser lines, and to determine\r\ntheir average bearing. _The volcanic agencies must have extended\r\nathwart the country from south-west to north-east._ Mark in a map\r\nof the island--all the better if it be a geological one--the line\r\nin which most of our mountain ranges stretch across from the German\r\nOcean to the Atlantic,--the line, too, in which our friths, lochs,\r\nand bays, on both the eastern and western coasts, and especially\r\nthose of the latter, run into the interior. Mark, also, the line\r\nof the geological formations, where least broken by insulated\r\ngroups of hills--the line, for instance, of the Old Red Sandstone\r\nbelt, which flanks the southern base of the Grampians--the nearly\r\nparallel line of our Scottish Coal-field, in its course from sea\r\nto sea--the line of the Grauwacke, which forms so large a portion\r\nof the south of Scotland--the line of the English Coal-field, of\r\nthe Lias, of the Oolite, of the Chalk--and how in this process of\r\ndiagonal lining, if I may so speak, the south-eastern portion of\r\nEngland comes to be cut off from the secondary formations altogether,\r\nand, but for the denudation of the valley of the Weald, would have\r\nexhibited only tertiary depositions. In all these lines, whether of\r\nmountains, lakes, friths, or formations, there is an approximation to\r\nparallelism with the line of the great Caledonian valley--proofs that\r\nthe upheaving agency from beneath must have acted in this direction\r\nfrom some unknown cause, during all the immensely extended term of\r\nits operations, and along the entire length of the island. It is a\r\nfact not unworthy of remark, that the profound depths of Loch Ness\r\nundulated in strange sympathy with the reeling towers and crashing\r\nwalls of Lisbon, during the great earthquake of 1755; and that the\r\nimpulse, true to its ancient direction, sent the waves in huge\r\nfurrows to the north-east and the south-west.\r\n\r\nThe north-eastern portion of this rectilinear wall or chain runs,\r\nfor about thirty miles, through an Old Red Sandstone district. The\r\nmaterials which compose it are as unlike those of the plain out of\r\nwhich it arises, as the materials of a stone dike, running half-way\r\ninto a field, are unlike the vegetable mould which forms the field's\r\nsurface. The ridge itself is of a granitic texture--a true gneiss.\r\nAt its base we find only conglomerates, sandstones, shales, and\r\nstratified clays, and these lying against it in very high angles.\r\nHence the geological interest of this lower portion of the wall.\r\nAs has been shrewdly remarked by Mr. Murchison,[AG] in one of his\r\nearlier papers, the gneiss seems to have been forced through the\r\nsandstone from beneath, in a solid, not a fluid form; and as the\r\nridge a-top is a narrow one, and the sides remarkably abrupt--an\r\nexcellent wedge, both in consistency and form--instead of having\r\nacted on the surrounding depositions, as most of the south country\r\ntraps have done that have merely issued from a vent, and overlaid\r\nthe upper strata, it has torn up the entire formation from the very\r\nbottom. Imagine a large wedge forced from below through a sheet of\r\nthick ice on a river or pond. First the ice rises in an angle, that\r\nbecomes sharper and higher as the wedge rises; then it cracks and\r\nopens, presenting its upturned edges on both sides, and through comes\r\nthe wedge. And this is a very different process, be it observed,\r\nfrom what takes place when the ice merely cracks, and the water\r\nissues through the crack. In the one case there is a rent, and water\r\ndiffused over the surface; in the other, there is the projecting\r\nwedge, flanked by the upturned edges of the ice; and these edges, of\r\ncourse, serve as indices to decide regarding the ice's thickness,\r\nand the various layers of which it is composed. Now, such are the\r\nphenomena exhibited by the wedge-like granitic ridge. The Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone, tilted up against it on both sides, at an angle\r\nof about eighty, exhibits in some parts a section of well nigh two\r\nthousand feet, stretching from the lower conglomerate to the soft,\r\nunfossiliferous sandstone, which forms in Ross and Cromarty the upper\r\nbeds of the formation. There is a mighty advantage to the geologist\r\nin this arrangement. When books are packed up in a deep box or chest,\r\nwe have to raise the upper tier ere we can see the tier below, and\r\nthis second tier ere we can arrive at a third, and so on to the\r\nbottom. But when well arranged on the shelves of a library, we have\r\nmerely to run the eye along their lettered backs, and we can thus\r\nform an acquaintance with them at a glance, which in the other case\r\nwould have cost us a good deal of trouble. Now, in the neighborhood\r\nof this granitic wedge, or wall, the strata are arranged, not like\r\nbooks in a box,--such was their original position,--but like books\r\non the shelves of a library. They have been unpacked and arranged by\r\nthe uptilting agent; and the knowledge of them, which could only have\r\nbeen attained in their first circumstances by perforating them with\r\na shaft of immense depth, may now be acquired simply by passing over\r\ntheir edges. A morning's saunter gives us what would have cost, but\r\nfor the upheaving granite, the labor of a hundred miners for five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AG: See _Transactions of the London Geological Society_ for\r\n1828, p. 354.]\r\n\r\nBy far the greater portion of the life of the writer was spent within\r\nless than half an hour's walk of one of these upturned edges. I have\r\ndescribed the granitic rock, with reference to the disturbance it has\r\noccasioned as a wedge forced from below, and with reference to its\r\nrectilinear position in the sandstone district which it traverses,\r\nas a stone wall running half-way into a field. It may communicate a\r\nstill corrector and livelier idea to think of it as a row of wedges,\r\nsuch as one sometimes sees in a quarry when the workmen are engaged\r\nin cutting out from the mass some immense block, intended to form a\r\nstately column or huge architrave. The eminences, like the wedges,\r\nare separated; in some places the sandstone lies between--in others\r\nthere occur huge chasms filled by the sea. The Friths of Cromarty\r\nand Beauly, for instance, and the Bay of Munlochy, open into the\r\ninterior between these wedge-like eminences;--the well-known Sutors\r\nof Cromarty represent two of the wedges; and it was the section\r\nfurnished by the Southern Sutor that lay so immediately in the\r\nwriter's neighborhood. The line of the Cromarty Frith forms an\r\nangle of about thirty-five degrees with that of the granitic line\r\nof wedge-like hills which it bisects; and hence the peculiar shape\r\nof that tongue of land which forms the lower portion of the Black\r\nIsle, and which, washed by the Moray Frith on the one side, and by\r\nthe Frith of Cromarty on the other, has its apex occupied by the\r\nSouthern Sutor. Imagine a lofty promontory somewhat resembling a\r\nhuge spear thrust horizontally into the sea--a ponderous mass of\r\ngranitic gneiss, of about a mile in length, forming the head, and\r\na rectilinear line of the Old Red Sandstone, more than ten miles\r\nin length, forming the shaft; and such is the appearance which\r\nthis tongue of land presents, when viewed from its north-western\r\nboundary, the Cromarty Frith. When viewed from the Moray Frith,--its\r\nsouth-western boundary,--we see the same granitic spear-head, but\r\nfind the line of the shaft knobbed by the other granitic eminences of\r\nthe chain.\r\n\r\nNow on this tongue of land I first broke ground as a geologist.\r\nThe quarry described in my introductory chapter, as that in which\r\nmy notice was first attracted by the ripple markings, opens on the\r\nCromarty Frith side of this huge spear-shaft; the quarry to which\r\nI removed immediately after, and beside which I found the fossils\r\nof the Lias, opens on its Moray Frith side. The uptilted section of\r\nsandstone occurs on both sides, where the shaft joins to the granitic\r\nspear-head, but the Lias I found on the Moray Frith side alone. It\r\nstuds the coast in detached patches, sorely worn by the incessant\r\nlashings of the Frith; and each patch bears an evident relation,\r\nin the place it occupies, to a corresponding knob or wedge in the\r\ngranitic line. The Northern Sutor, as has been just said, is one of\r\nthese knobs or wedges. It has its accompanying patch of Lias upheaved\r\nat its base, and lying unconformably, not only to its granitic\r\nstrata, but also to its subordinate sandstones. The Southern Sutor,\r\nanother of these knobs, has also its accompanying patch of Lias,\r\nwhich, though lying beyond the fall of the tide, strews the beach,\r\nafter every storm from the east, with its shales and its fossils.\r\nThe hill of Eathie is yet another knob of the series, and it, too,\r\nhas its Lias patch. The granitic wedges have not only uptilted the\r\nsandstone, but they have also upheaved the superincumbent Lias,\r\nwhich, but for their agency, would have remained buried under the\r\nwaters of the Frith, and its ever accumulating banks of sand and\r\ngravel. I had remarked at an early period the correspondence of the\r\ngranitic knobs with the Lias patches, and striven to realize the\r\noriginal place and position of the latter ere the disturbing agent\r\nhad upcast them to the light. What, I have asked, was the extent of\r\nthis comparatively modern formation in this part of the world, ere\r\nthe line of wedges were forced through from below? A wedge struck\r\nthrough the ice of a pond towards the centre breaks its continuity,\r\nand we find the ice on both sides the wedge; whereas, when struck\r\nthrough at the pond edge, it merely raises the ice from the bank, and\r\nwe find it, in consequence, on but one side the wedge. Whether, have\r\nI often inquired, w T ere the granitic wedges of this line forced\r\nthrough the Lias at one of its edges, or at a comparatively central\r\npoint? and about ten years ago I set myself to ascertain whether I\r\ncould not solve the question. The Southern Sutor is a wedge open to\r\nexamination on both its sides;--the Moray Frith washes it upon one\r\nside, the Cromarty Frith on the other. Was the Lias to be found on\r\nboth its sides? If so, the wedge must have been forced _through_ the\r\nformation, not merely _beside_ it. It occurs, as I have said, on the\r\nMoray Frith side of the wedge; and I resolved, on carefully exploring\r\nthe Frith of Cromarty, to try whether it did not occur on that side\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nWith this object I set out on an exploratory excursion, on a\r\ndelightful morning of August, 1830. The tide was falling; it had\r\nalready reached the line of half ebb; and from the Southern Sutor\r\nto the low, long promontory on which the town of Cromarty is built,\r\nthere extended a broad belt of mingled sand-banks and pools,\r\naccumulations of boulders, and shingle, and large tracts darkened\r\nwith algæ. I passed direct by a grassy pathway to the Sutor, the\r\ngranitic spear-head of a late illustration,--and turned, when I\r\nreached the curved and contorted gneiss, to trace through the broad\r\nbelt left by the retiring waters, and in a line parallel to what I\r\nhave described as the shaft of the huge spear, the beds and strata\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone in their ascending succession. I first\r\ncrossed the conglomerate base of the system, here little more than\r\na hundred feet in thickness. The ceaseless dash of the waves, which\r\nsmooth most other rocks, has a contrary effect on this bed, except\r\nin a few localities, where its arenaceous cement of base is much\r\nindurated. Under both the Northern and Southern Sutors the softer\r\ncement yields to the incessant action, while the harder pebbles\r\nstand out in bold relief; so that, wherever it presents a mural\r\nfront to the breakers, we are reminded, by its appearance, of the\r\nartificial rock work of the architect. It roughens as the rocks\r\naround it polish. Quitting the conglomerate, I next passed over a\r\nthick bed of coarse reel and yellow sandstone, with here and there a\r\nfew pebbles sticking from its surface, and here and there a stratum\r\nof finer-grained fissile sandstone inserted between the rougher\r\nstrata: I then crossed over a strata of an impure grayish limestone,\r\nand a slaty clay, abounding, as I long afterwards ascertained, in\r\nichthyolites and vegetable remains. There are minute veins in the\r\nlimestone (apparently cracks filled up) of a jet black bituminous\r\nsubstance, resembling anthracite; the stratified clay is mottled\r\nby layers of semi-aluminous, semi-calcareous nodules, arranged like\r\nlayers of flint in the upper Chalk. These nodules, when cut up and\r\npolished, present very agreeable combinations of color; there is\r\ngenerally an outer ring of reddish brown, an inner ring of pale\r\nyellow, and a central patch of red, and the whole is prettily veined\r\nwith dark-colored carbonate of lime.[AH] Passing onwards and upwards\r\nin the line of the strata, I next crossed over a series of alternate\r\nbeds of coarse sandstone and stratified clay, and then lost sight of\r\nthe rock altogether, in a wide waste of shingle and boulder-stones,\r\nresting on a dark blue argillaceous diluvium, sometimes employed\r\nin that part of the country, from its tenacious and impermeable\r\ncharacter, for lining ponds and dams, and as mortar for the\r\nfoundations of low-lying houses, exposed in wet weather to the\r\nsudden rise of water. The numerous boulders of this tract have their\r\nstory to tell, and it is a curious one. The Southern Sutor, with its\r\nmultitudinous fragments of gneiss, torn from its sides by the sea,\r\nor loosened by the action of frosts and storms, and rolled down its\r\nprecipices, is only a few hundred yards away;--its base, where these\r\nlie thickest, has been swept by tempests, chiefly from the east, for\r\nthousands and thousands of years; and the direct effect of these\r\ntempests, regarded as transporting agents, would have been to strew\r\nthis stony tract with those detached fragments. The same billow that\r\nsends its long roll from the German Ocean to sweep the base of the\r\nSutor, and to leap up against its precipices to the height of eighty\r\nand a hundred feet, breaks in foam, only a minute after, over this\r\nstony tract; which has, in consequence, its sprinkling of fragments\r\nof gneiss, transported by an agency so obvious. But for every one\r\nsuch fragment which it bears, we find at least ten boulders that have\r\nbeen borne for forty and fifty miles in the opposite direction from\r\nthe interior of the country--a direction in which no transporting\r\nagency now exists. The tempests of thousands of years have conveyed\r\nfor but a few hundred yards not more than a tithe of the materials\r\nof this tract; nine tenths of the whole have been conveyed by an\r\nolder agency over spaces of forty and fifty miles. How immensely more\r\npowerful, then, or how immensely protracted in its operation, must\r\nthat older agency have been!\r\n\r\n[Footnote AH: A concretionary limestone of the Old Red system in\r\nEngland, variegated with purple and green, was at one time wrought as\r\na marble.--_Silurian System_, Part i. p. 176.]\r\n\r\nI passed onwards, and reached a little bay, or, rather, angular\r\nindentation of the coast, in the neighborhood of the town. It was\r\nlaid bare by the tide, this morning, far beyond its outer opening;\r\nand the huge, table-like boulder, which occupies nearly its centre,\r\nand to which, in a former chapter, I have had occasion to refer,\r\nheld but a middle place between the still darkened flood-line that\r\nran high along the beach, and the brown line of ebb that bristled\r\nfar below with forests of the rough-stemmed tangle. This little\r\nbay, or inflection of the coast, serves as a sort of natural wear\r\nin detaining floating drift-weed, and is often found piled, after\r\nviolent storms from the east, with accumulations, many yards in\r\nextent, and several feet in depth, of kelp and tangle, mixed with\r\nzoöphytes and mollusca, and the remains of fish killed among the\r\nshallows by the tempest. Early in the last century, a large body\r\nof herrings, pursued by whales and porpoises, were stranded in it,\r\nto the amount of several hundred barrels; and it is said that salt\r\nand cask failed the packers when but comparatively a small portion\r\nof the shoal were cured, and that by much the greatest part of them\r\nwere carried away by the neighboring farmers for manure. Ever since\r\nthe formation of the present coast-line, this natural wear has been\r\narresting, tide after tide, its heaps of organic matter, but the\r\ncircumstances favorable to their preservation have been wanting:\r\nthey ferment and decay when driven high on the beach; and the next\r\nspring-tide, accompanied by a gale from the west, sweeps every\r\nvestige of them away; and so, after the lapse of many centuries,\r\nwe find no other organisms among the rounded pebbles that form the\r\nbeach of this little bay, than merely a few broken shells, and\r\noccasionally a mouldering fish-bone. Thus very barren formations may\r\nbelong to periods singularly rich in organic existences. When what is\r\nnow the little bay was the bottom of a profound ocean, and far from\r\nany shore, the circumstances for the preservation of its organisms\r\nmust have been much more favorable. In no locality in the Old Red\r\nSandstone with which I am acquainted have such beautifully preserved\r\nfossils been found. But I anticipate.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the little bay, and throughout the greater part of\r\nits area, I found the rock exposed--a circumstance which I had marked\r\nmany years before, when a mere boy, without afterwards recurring\r\nto it as one of interest. But I had now learned to look at rocks\r\nwith another eye; and the thought which first suggested itself to\r\nme regarding the rock of the little bay was, that I had found the\r\nespecial object of my search--the Lias. The appearances are in\r\nsome respects not dissimilar. The Lias of the north of Scotland is\r\nrepresented in some localities by dark-colored, unctuous clays, in\r\nothers by grayish black sandstones, that look like indurated mud,\r\nand in others by beds of black fissile shale, alternating with bands\r\nof coarse, impure limestone, and studded between the bands with\r\nlimestone nodules of richer quality and finer grain. The rock laid\r\nbare in the little bay is a stratified clay, of a gray color tinged\r\nwith olive, and occurring in beds separated by indurated bands of\r\ngray, micaceous sandstone. They also abound in calcareous nodules.\r\nThe dip of the strata, too, is very different from that of the beds\r\nwhich lean against the gneiss of the Sutor. Instead of an angle of\r\neighty, it presents an angle of less than eight. The rocks of the\r\nlittle bay must have lain beyond the disturbing, uptilting influence\r\nof the granitic wedge. So thickly are the nodules spread over the\r\nsurface of some of the beds, that they reminded me of floats of\r\nbroken ice on the windward side of a lake after a few days' thaw,\r\nwhen the edges of the fragments are smoothed and rounded, and they\r\npress upon one another, so as to cover, except in the angular\r\ninterstices, the entire surface.\r\n\r\nI set myself carefully to examine. The first nodule I laid open\r\ncontained a bituminous looking mass, in which I could trace a\r\nfew pointed bones and a few minute scales. The next abounded in\r\nrhomboidal and finely enamelled scales, of much larger size and more\r\ndistinct character. I wrought on with the eagerness of a discoverer\r\nentering for the first time in a _terra incognita_ of wonders. Almost\r\nevery fragment of clay, every splinter of sandstone, every limestone\r\nnodule, contained its organism--scales, spines, plates, bones, entire\r\nfish; but not one organism of the Lias could I find--no ammonites,\r\nno belemnites, no gryphites, no shells of any kind: the vegetable\r\nimpressions were entirely different; and not a single scale,\r\nplate, or ichthyodorulite could I identify with those of the newer\r\nformation. I had got into a different world, and among the remains of\r\na different creation; but where was its proper place in the scale?\r\nThe beds of the little bay are encircled by thick accumulations\r\nof diluvium and debris, nor could I trace their relation to a\r\nsingle known rock. I was struck, as I well might, by the utter\r\nstrangeness of the forms--the oar-like arms of the _Pterichthys_ and\r\nits tortoise-like plates--the strange, buckler-looking head of the\r\n_Coccosteus_, which, I suppose, might possibly be the back of a small\r\ntortoise, though the tubercles reminded me rather of the skin of the\r\nshark--the polished scales and plates of the _Osteolepis_--the spined\r\nand scaled fins of the _Cheiracanthus_--above all, the one-sided\r\ntail of at least eight out of the ten or twelve varieties of fossil\r\nwhich the deposit contained. All together excited and astonished\r\nme. But some time elapsed ere I learned to distinguish the nicer\r\ngeneric differences of the various organisms of the formation. I\r\nfound fragments of the _Pterichthys_ on this morning; but I date\r\nits discovery, in relation to the mind of the discoverer, more than\r\na twelvemonth later.[AI] I confounded the _Cheiracanthus_, too,\r\nwith its single-spined, membranous dorsal, with _Diplacanthus_\r\nichthyolite, furnished with two such dorsals; and the _Diplopterus_\r\nwith the _Osteolepis_. Still, however, I saw enough to exhilarate\r\nand interest: I wrought on till the advancing tide came splashing\r\nover the nodules, and a powerful August sun had risen towards the\r\nmiddle sky; and were I to sum up all my happier hours, the hour would\r\nnot be forgotten in which I sat down on a rounded boulder of granite,\r\nby the edge of the sea, when the last bed was covered, and spread out\r\non the beach before me the spoils of the morning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AI: I find, by some notes, which had escaped my notice when\r\ndrawing up for the _Witness_ newspaper the sketches now expanded\r\ninto a volume, that in the year 1834 I furnished the collection of\r\na geological friend, the Rev. John Swanson, minister of the parish\r\nof Small Isles, in the Outer Hebrides, with a well-marked specimen\r\nof the _Pterichthys Milleri_. The circumstance pleasingly reminds me\r\nof the first of all my early acquaintance, who learned to deem the\r\ntime not idly squandered that was spent in exploring the wonders of\r\nbygone creations. Does the minister of Small Isles still remember\r\nthe boy who led him in quest of petrifactions--himself a little boy\r\nat the time--to a deep, solitary cave on the Moray Frith, where\r\nthey lingered amidst stalactites and mosses till the wild sea had\r\nsurrounded them unmarked, barring all chance of retreat, and the dark\r\nnight came on?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther Discoveries of the Ichthyolite Beds.--Found in one\r\nLocality under a Bed of Peat.--Discovered in another beneath\r\nan ancient Burying-ground.--In a third underlying the Lias\r\nFormation.--In a fourth overtopped by a still older Sandstone\r\nDeposit.--Difficulties in ascertaining the true Place of a\r\nnewly-discovered Formation.--Caution against drawing too hasty\r\nInferences from the mere circumstance of Neighborhood.--The Writer\r\nreceives his first Assistance from without.--_Geological Appendix_\r\nof the Messrs.

Directly above the little bay there is a corn-field, and\r\nbeyond the field a wood of forest trees; and in this wood, in the\r\nbottom of a water-course, scooped out of the rock through a bed of\r\npeat, I found the stratified clay charged with scales. A few hundred\r\nyards farther to the west there is a deep, wooded ravine cut through\r\na thick bed of red diluvial clay. The top of the bank directly\r\nabove is occupied by the ruins of an ancient chapel, and a group of\r\nmoss-grown tombstones; and in the gorge of this ravine, underlying\r\nthe little field of graves by about sixty feet, I discovered a still\r\nmore ancient place of sepulture--that of the ichthyolites. I explored\r\nevery bank, rock, and ravine on the northern or Cromarty Frith side\r\nof the tongue of land, with its terminal point of granitic gneiss, to\r\nwhich I have had such frequent occasion to refer, and then turned to\r\nexplore the southern, or Moray Frith side, in the rectilinear line\r\nof the great valley. And here I was successful on a larger scale. A\r\nrange of lofty sandstone cliffs, hollowed by the sea, extends for\r\na distance of about two miles between two of the granitic knobs\r\nor wedges of the line--the Southern Sutor and the hill of Eathie.\r\nAnd along well nigh the entire length of this range of cliffs, I\r\nsucceeded in tracing a continuous ichthyolite bed, abounding in\r\nremains, and lying far below the Lias, and unconformable to it. I\r\npursued my researches, and in the sides of a romantic precipitous\r\ndell, through which the Burn of Eathie--a small, mossy stream--finds\r\nits way to the Moray Frith, I again discovered the fish-beds running\r\ndeep into the interior of the country, with immense strata of a pale\r\nyellow sandstone resting over them, and strata of a chocolate red\r\nlying below. But their place in the geological scale was still to fix.\r\n\r\nI had seen enough to convince me that they form a continuous convex\r\nstratum in the sandstone spear-shaft, covering it saddle-wise\r\nfrom side to side, dipping towards the Moray Frith on the south,\r\nand to the Cromarty Frith on the north--that, as in a _bona\r\nfide_ spear-shaft, the annual ring or layer of growth of one\r\nseason is overlaid by the annual rings of succeeding seasons, and\r\nunderlaid by those of preceding ones; so this huge semi-ring of\r\nfossiliferous clays and limestones had its underlying semi-ring\r\nof Red Sandstone, and its overlying semi-rings of yellow, of red,\r\nand of gray sandstone. I knew, besides, that beneath there was a\r\nsemi-ring of conglomerate, the base of the system; and that, for\r\nmore than two hundred yards upwards, ring followed ring in unbroken\r\nsuccession--now sandstone, now limestone, now stratified clay. But\r\nthough intimately acquainted with these lower rocks for more than a\r\nhundred fathoms from their base upwards, and with the upper rocks\r\non both sides the ichthyolitic bed for more than a hundred feet,\r\nthere was an intervening hiatus, whose extent at this period I found\r\nit impossible to ascertain. And hence my uncertainty regarding the\r\nplace of the ichthyolites, seeing that whole formations might be\r\nrepresented by the occurring gap. On the Moray Frith side, where\r\nthe sections are of huge extent, a doubtful repeat in the strata at\r\none point of junction, and an abrupt fault at another, cuts off the\r\nupper series of beds to which the organisms belong, from the lower\r\nto which the great conglomerate belongs. On the Cromarty Frith side\r\nthe sections are mere detached patches, obscured at every point by\r\ndiluvium and soil; and, in conceiving of the whole as a continuous\r\nline, with the Lias a-top and the granite group at the bottom, I was\r\never reminded of those coast-lines of the ancient geographers, where\r\na few uncertain dots, a few deeper markings, and here and there a\r\nblank space or two, showed the blended results of conjecture and\r\ndiscovery--whether they give a _Terra Incognita Australia_ to the one\r\nhemisphere, or a North-Western passage to the other. The ichthyolites\r\nin a section so doubtful might be regarded as belonging to either\r\nthe Old or the New Red Sandstone--to the Coal Measures, or to the\r\nMountain Limestone. All was uncertainty.\r\n\r\nOne remark in the passing: it may teach the young geologist to be\r\ncautious in his inferences, and illustrate, besides, those gaps\r\nwhich occur in the geological scale. I had now discovered the\r\nichthyolite beds in five different localities; in one of these--the\r\nfirst discovered--there is no overlying stratum; it seems as if\r\nthe bed formed the top of the formation: in all the others the\r\noverlying stratum is different, and belongs to distant and widely\r\nseparated ages. We cut in one locality through a peat moss--part of\r\nthe ruins, perhaps, of one of those forests which covered, about the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era, well nigh the entire surface of\r\nthe island, and sheltered the naked inhabitants from the legions of\r\nAgricola. We find, as we dig, huge trunks of oak and elm, cones of\r\nthe Scotch fir, handfuls of hazel-nuts, and bones and horns of the\r\nroe and the red deer. The writer, when a boy, found among the peat\r\nthe horn of a gigantic elk. And, forming the bottom of this recent\r\ndeposit, and _lying conformably to it_, we find the ichthyolite\r\nbeds, with their antique organisms. The remains of oak and elm\r\nleaves, and of the spikes and cones of the pine, lie within half\r\na foot of the remains of the _Coccosteus_ and _Diplopterus_. We\r\ndig in another locality through an ancient burying-ground; we pass\r\nthrough a superior stratum of skulls and coffins, and an inferior\r\nstratum, barren in organic remains, and then arrive at the stratified\r\nclays, with their ichthyolites. In a third locality we find these in\r\njunction with the Lias, and underlying its lignites, ammonites, and\r\nbelemnites, just as we see them underlying, in the other two, the\r\nhuman bones and the peat moss. And in yet a fourth locality we see\r\nthem overlaid by immense arenaceous beds, that belong evidently, as\r\ntheir mineralogical character testifies, to either the Old or the\r\nNew Red Sandstone. The convulsions and revolutions of the geological\r\nworld, like those of the political, are sad confounders of place\r\nand station, and bring into close fellowship the high and the low;\r\nnor is it safe in either world,--such have been the effects of the\r\ndisturbing agencies,--to judge of ancient relations by existing\r\nneighborhoods, or of original situations by present places of\r\noccupancy. \"Misery,\" says Shakspeare, \"makes strange bedfellows.\"\r\nThe changes and convulsions of the geological world have made strange\r\nbedfellows too. I have seen fossils of the Upper Lias and of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone washed together by the same wave, out of\r\nwhat might be taken, on a cursory survey, for the same bed, and then\r\nmingled with recent shells, algæ, branches of trees, and fragments of\r\nwrecks on the same sea-beach.\r\n\r\nYears passed, and in 1834 I received my first assistance from\r\nwithout, through the kindness of the Messrs. Anderson, of Inverness,\r\nwho this year published their Guide to the _Highlands and Islands\r\nof Scotland_--a work which has never received half its due measure\r\nof praise. It contains, in a condensed and very pleasing form, the\r\naccumulated gleanings, for half a lifetime, of two very superior\r\nmen, skilled in science, and of highly cultivated taste and literary\r\nability; whose remarks, from their intimate acquaintance with every\r\nfoot-breadth of country which they describe, invariably exhibit\r\nthat freshness of actual observation, recorded on the spot, which\r\nGray regarded as \"worth whole cart-loads of recollection.\" But\r\nwhat chiefly interested me in their work was its dissertative\r\nappendices--admirable digests of the Natural History, Antiquities,\r\nand Geology of the country. The appendix devoted to Geology,\r\nconsisting of fifty closely printed pages,--abridged in part from the\r\nhighest geological authorities, and in much greater part the result\r\nof original observation,--contains, beyond comparison, the completest\r\ndescription of the rocks, fossils, and formations of the Northern\r\nand Western Highlands, which has yet been given to the public in a\r\npopular form. I perused it with intense interest, and learned from\r\nit, for the first time, of the fossil fishes of Caithness and Gamrie.\r\n\r\nThere was almost nothing known, at the period, of the oryctology of\r\nthe older rocks--little, indeed, of that of the Old Red Sandstone,\r\nin its proper character as such; and with no such guiding clew\r\nas has since been furnished by Agassiz, and the later researches\r\nof Mr. Murchison, the writer of the appendix had recorded as his\r\nultimate conclusion, that \"the middle schistoze system of Caithness,\r\ncontaining the fossil fish, was intermediate in geological character\r\nand position between the Old and New Red Sandstone formations.\" The\r\nichthyolites of Gamrie he described as resembling those of Caithness;\r\nand I at once recognized, in his minute descriptions of both, the\r\nfossil fish of Cromarty. The mineralogical accompaniments, too,\r\nseemed nearly the same. In Caithness, the animal remains are mixed\r\nup in some places with a black bituminous matter like tar. I had but\r\nlately found among the beds of the little bay a mass of soft adhesive\r\nbitumen, hermetically sealed up in the limestone, which, when broken\r\nopen, reminded me, from the powerful odor it cast, and which filled\r\nfor several days the room in which I kept it, of the old Gaulish\r\nmummy of which we find so minute account in the Natural History of\r\nGoldsmith. The nodules which enclosed the organisms at Gamrie were\r\ndescribed as of a sub-crystalline, radiating, fibrous structure. So\r\nmuch was this the case with some of the nodules at Cromarty, that\r\nthey had often reminded me, when freshly broken, though composed of\r\npure carbonate of lime, of masses of asbestos. The scales and bones\r\nof the Caithness ichthyolites were blended, it was stated, with the\r\nfragments of a \"supposed tortoise nearly allied to trionyx;\" one of\r\nthe ichthyolites, a _Dipterus_, was characterized by large scales,\r\na double dorsal, and a one-sided tail; the entire lack of shells\r\nand zoöphytes was remarked, and the abundance of obscure vegetable\r\nimpressions. In short, had the accomplished writer of the appendix\r\nbeen briefly describing the beds at Cromarty, instead of those of\r\nCaithness and Gamrie, he might have employed the same terms, and\r\nremarked the same circumstances--the striated nodules, the mineral\r\ntar, the vegetable impressions, the absence of shells and zoöphytes,\r\nthe large-scaled, and double-finned ichthyolites--the peculiarities\r\nof which applied equally to the _Dipterus_ and _Diplopterus_--and\r\nthe supposed tortoise, in which I once recognized the _Coccosteus_.\r\nIt was much to know, that this doubtful formation--for as doubtful\r\nI still regarded it--was of such considerable extent, and occurred\r\nin localities so widely separated. I corresponded with the courteous\r\nauthor of the appendix, at that time General Secretary to the\r\nNorthern Institution for the Promotion of Science and Literature,\r\nand Conservator of its Museum; and, forwarding to him duplicates of\r\nsome of my better specimens, had, as I had anticipated, the generic\r\nidentity of the Cromarty ichthyolites with those of Caithness and\r\nGamrie fully confirmed.\r\n\r\nMy narrative is, I am afraid, becoming tedious; but it embodies\r\nsomewhat more than the mere history of a sort of Robinson Crusoe in\r\nGeology, cut off for years from all intercourse with his kind. It\r\ncontains, also, the history of a formation in its connection with\r\nscience; and the reader will, I trust, bear with me for a few pages\r\nmore. Seasons passed; and I received new light from the researches\r\nof Agassiz, which, if it did not show me my way more clearly,\r\nrendered it at least more interesting, by associating with it one\r\nof those wonderful truths, stranger that fictions, which rise ever\r\nand anon from the profounder depths of science, and whose use, in\r\ntheir connection with the human intellect, seems to be to stimulate\r\nthe faculties. I have often had occasion to refer to the one-sided\r\ncondition of tail characteristic of the ichthyolites of the Old Red\r\nSandstone. It characterizes, says Agassiz, the fish of all the more\r\nancient formations. At one certain point in the descending scale\r\nNature entirely alters her plan in the formation of the tail. All\r\nthe ichthyolites above are fashioned after one particular type--all\r\nbelow after another and different type. The bibliographer can tell\r\nat what periods in the history of letters one character ceased to\r\nbe employed and another came into use. Black letter, for instance,\r\nin our own country, was scarce ever resorted to for purposes of\r\ngeneral literature after the reign of James VI.; and in manuscript\r\nwriting the Italian hand superseded the Saxon about the close of\r\nthe seventeenth century. Now, is it not truly wonderful to find an\r\nanalogous change of character in that pictorial history of the past\r\nwhich Geology furnishes? From the first appearance of vertebrated\r\nexistences to the middle beds of the New Red Sandstone,--a space\r\nincluding the Upper Ludlow rocks, the Old Red Sandstone in all\r\nits members, the Mountain Limestone, with the Limestone of Burdie\r\nHouse, the Coal Measures, the Lower New Red, and the Magnesian\r\nLimestone,--we find only the ancient or unequally lobed type of\r\ntail. In all the formations above, including the Lias, the Oolite,\r\nMiddle, Upper, and Lower, the Wealden, the Green-Sand, the Chalk,\r\nand the Tertiary, we find only the equally-lobed condition of tail.\r\nAnd it is more than probable, that, with the tail, the character of\r\nthe skeleton also changed; that the more ancient type characterized,\r\nthroughout, the semi-cartilaginous order of fishes, just as the more\r\nmodern type characterizes the osseous fishes; and that the upper line\r\nof the Magnesian Limestone marks the period at which the order became\r\nextinct. Conjecture lacks footing in grappling with a revolution\r\nso extensive and so wonderful. Shall I venture to throw out a\r\nsuggestion on the subject, in connection with another suggestion\r\nwhich has emanated from one of the first of living geologists? Fish,\r\nof all existing creatures, seem the most capable of sustaining high\r\ndegrees of heat, and are to be found in some of the hot springs of\r\nContinental Europe, where it is supposed scarce any other animal\r\ncould live. Now, all the fish of the ancient type are thickly covered\r\nby a defensive armor of bone, arranged in plates, bars, or scales,\r\nor all the three modes together, as in the _Osteolepis_ and one\r\nhalf its contemporaries. The one-sided tail is united invariably\r\nto a strong cuirass. And it has been suggested by Dr. Buckland,\r\nthat this strong cuirass may have formed a sort of defence against\r\nthe injurious effects of a highly heated surrounding medium. The\r\nsuggestion is, of course, based purely on hypothesis. It may be\r\nstated, in direct connection with it, however, that in the Lias--the\r\nfirst richly fossiliferous formation overlying that in which the\r\nchange occurred--we find, for the first time in the geological\r\nsystem, decided indications of a change of seasons. The foot-prints\r\nof winter are left impressed amid the lignites of the Cromarty Lias.\r\nIn a specimen now before me, the alternations of summer heat and\r\nwinter cold are as distinctly marked in the annual rings as in the\r\npines or larches of our present forests; whereas in the earlier\r\nlignites, contemporary with ichthyolites of the ancient type, either\r\nno annual rings appear, or the markings, if present, are both faint\r\nand unfrequent. _Just ere winter began to take its place among\r\nthe seasons, the fish fitted for living in a highly heated medium\r\ndisappeared:_ they were created to inhabit a thermal ocean, and died\r\naway as it cooled down. Fish of a similar type may now inhabit the\r\nseas of Venus, or even of Jupiter, which, from its enormous bulk,\r\nthough greatly more distant from the sun than our earth, may still\r\npowerfully retain the internal heat.\r\n\r\nI still pursued my inquiries, and received a valuable auxiliary in a\r\ngentleman from India, Dr. John Malcolmson, of Madras--a member of the\r\nLondon Geological Society, and a man of high scientific attainments\r\nand great general knowledge. Above all, I found him to possess, in\r\na remarkable degree, that spirit of research, almost amounting to a\r\npassion, which invariably marks the superior man. He had spent month\r\nafter month under the burning sun of India, amid fever marshes and\r\ntiger jungles, acquainting himself with the unexplored geological\r\nfield which, only a few years ago, that vast continent presented,\r\nand in collecting fossils hitherto unnamed and undescribed. He had\r\npursued his inquiries, too, along the coasts of the Red Sea, and far\r\nupwards on the banks of the Nile; and now, in returning for a time\r\nto his own country, he had brought with him the determination of\r\nknowing it thoroughly as a man of science and a geologist. I had the\r\npleasure of first introducing him to the ichthyolites of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone, by bringing him to my first-discovered bed, and\r\nlaying open, by a blow of the hammer, a beautiful _Osteolepis_. He\r\nwas much interested in the fossils of my little collection, and at\r\nonce decided that the formation which contained them could be no\r\nrepresentative of the Coal Measures. After ranging over the various\r\nbeds on both sides the rectilinear ridge, and acquainting himself\r\nthoroughly with their organisms, he set out to explore the Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstones of Moray and Banff, hitherto deemed peculiarly barren,\r\nbut whose character too much resembled that of the rocks which he had\r\nnow ascertained to be so abundant in fossils, not to be held worthy\r\nof further examination. He explored the banks of the Spey, and found\r\nthe ichthyolite beds extensively developed at Dipple, in the middle\r\nof an Old Red Sandstone district. He pursued his researches, and\r\ntraced the formation in ravines and the beds of rivers, from the\r\nvillage of Buckie to near the field of Culloden; he found it exposed\r\nin the banks of the Nairn, in the ravines above Cawdor Castle, on the\r\neastern side of the hill of Rait, at Clune, Lethen-bar, and in the\r\nvale of Rothes--and in every instance low in the Old Reel Sandstone.\r\nThe formation hitherto deemed so barren in remains proved one of\r\nthe richest of them all, if not in tribes and families, at least in\r\nindividual fossils; and the reader may form some idea of the extent\r\nin which it has already been proved fossiliferous, when he remembers\r\nthat the tract includes as its extremes Orkney, Gamrie, and the\r\nnorth-eastern gorge of the great Caledonian Valley. The ichthyolites\r\nwere discovered in the latter locality in the quarry of Inches, three\r\nmiles beyond Inverness, by Mr. George Anderson, the gentleman to\r\nwhose geological attainments, as one of the authors of the _Guide\r\nBook_, I have lately had occasion to refer.\r\n\r\nI had now corresponded for several years with a little circle of\r\ngeological friends, and had described in my letters, and in some\r\ninstances had attempted to figure in them, my newly-found fossils.\r\nA letter which I wrote early in 1838 to Dr. Malcolmson, then at\r\nParis, and which contained a rude drawing of the _Pterichthys_,\r\nwas submitted to Agassiz, and the curiosity of the naturalist was\r\nexcited. He examined the figure, rather, however, with interest\r\nthan surprise, and read the accompanying description, not in the\r\nleast inclined to scepticism by the singularity of its details. He\r\nhad looked on too many wonders of a similar cast to believe that\r\nhe had exhausted them, or to evince any astonishment that Geology\r\nshould be found to contain one wonder more. Some months after, I\r\nsent a restored drawing of the same fossil to the Elgin Scientific\r\nSociety. I must state, however, that the restoration was by no\r\nmeans complete. The paddle-like arms were placed further below\r\nthe shoulders than in any actual species; and I had transferred,\r\nby mistake, to the creature's upper side, some of the plates of\r\nthe _Coccosteus_. Still the type was unequivocally that of the\r\n_Pterichthys_. The secretary of the Society, Mr. Patrick Duff, an\r\nexcellent geologist, to whose labors, in an upper formation of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone, I shall have afterwards occasion to refer,\r\nquestioned, as he well might, some of the details of the figure,\r\nand we corresponded for several weeks regarding it, somewhat\r\nin the style of Jonathan Oldbuck and his antiquarian friend,\r\nwho succeeded in settling the meaning of two whole words, in an\r\nantique inscription, in little more than two years. Most of the\r\nother members looked upon the entire drawing, so strange did the\r\nappearance seem, as embodying a fiction of the same class with\r\nthose embodied in the pictured griffins and unicorns of mythologic\r\nZoölogy; and, in amusing themselves with it, they bestowed on its\r\nbetailed and bepaddled figure, as if in anticipation of Agassiz,\r\nthe name of the draughtsman. Not many months after, however, a\r\n_bona fide_ _Pterichthys_ turned up in one of the newly discovered\r\nbeds of Nairnshire, and the Association ceased to joke, and began\r\nto wonder. T merely mention the circumstance in connection with a\r\nright challenged, at the late meeting of the British Association at\r\nGlasgow, by a gentleman of Elgin, to be regarded as the original\r\ndiscoverer of the _Pterichthys_. I am, of course, far from supposing\r\nthat the discovery was not actually made, but regret that it should\r\nhave been kept so close a secret at a time when it might have stood\r\nthe other discoverer of the creature in such stead.\r\n\r\nThe exact place of the ichthyolites in the system was still to fix.\r\nI was spending a day, early in the winter of 1839, among the nearly\r\nvertical strata that lean against the Northern Sutor. The section\r\nthere presented is washed by the tide for nearly three hundred yards\r\nfrom where it rests on the granitic gneiss; and each succeeding\r\nstratum in the ascending order may be as clearly traced as the\r\nalternate white and black squares in a marble pavement. First there\r\nis a bed of conglomerate two hundred and fifteen feet in thickness,\r\n\"identical in structure,\" say Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison,\r\nu with the older red conglomerates of Cumberland and the Island of\r\nArran,[AJ] and which cannot be distinguished from those conglomerates\r\nwhich lean against the southern flank of the Grampians, and on which\r\nDunnottar Castle is built. Immediately above the conglomerate there\r\nis a hundred and fourteen feet more of coarse sandstone strata, of\r\na reddish yellow hue, with occasionally a few pebbles enclosed, and\r\nthen twenty-seven feet additional of limestone and stratified clay.\r\nThere are no breaks, no faults, no thinning out of strata--all the\r\nbeds lie parallel, showing regular deposition. I had passed over\r\nthe section twenty times before, and had carefully examined the\r\nlimestone and the clay, but in vain. On this occasion, however, I was\r\nmore fortunate. I struck off a fragment. It contained a vegetable\r\nimpression of the same character with those of the ichthyolite beds;\r\nand after an hour's diligent search, I had turned out from the\r\nheart of the stratum plates and scales enough to fill a shelf in a\r\nmuseum--the helmet-like snout of an Osteolepis, the thorn-like spine\r\nof a _Cheiracanthus_, and a _Coccosteus_ well nigh entire. I had at\r\nlength, after a search of nearly ten years, found the true place of\r\nthe ichthyolite bed. The reader may smile, but I hope the smile will\r\nbe a good-natured one; a simple pleasure may be not the less sincere\r\non account of its simplicity; and \"little things are great to little\r\nmen.\" I passed over and over the strata, and found there could be no\r\nmistake. The place of the fossil fish in the scale is little more\r\nthan a hundred feet above the top, and not much more than a hundred\r\nyards above the base of the great conglomerate; and there lie over it\r\nin this section about five hundred feet of soft, arenaceous stone,\r\nwith here and there alternating bands of limestone and beds of clay\r\nstudded with nodules--all belonging to the inferior Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AJ: Different in one respect from the conglomerates of\r\nArran. It abounds in rolled fragments of granite, whereas in those\r\nof Arran there occur no pebbles of this rock. Arran has now its\r\ngranite in abundance; the northern locality has none; though, when\r\nthe conglomerates of the Lower Old Red Sandstone were in the course\r\nof forming, the case was exactly the reverse.]\r\n\r\nThe enormous depth of the Old Red Sandstone of England has been\r\ndivided by Mr. Murchison into three members, or formations--the\r\ndivision adopted in his _Elements_ by Mr. Lyell, as quoted in an\r\nearly chapter. These are, the lowest, or Tilestone formation, the\r\nmiddle, or Cornstone formation, and the uppermost, or Quartzose\r\nconglomerate formation. The terms are derived from mineralogical\r\ncharacters, and inadequate as designations, therefore, like that of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone itself, which, in many of its deposits, is\r\nnot _sandstone_, and is not _red_. But they serve to express great\r\nnatural divisions. Now the Tilestone member of England represents,\r\nas I have already stated, this Lower Old Red Sandstone formation of\r\nScotland; but its extent of vertical development, compared with that\r\nof the other two members of the system, is strikingly different in\r\nthe two countries. The Tilestones compose the least of the three\r\ndivisions in England; their representative in Scotland forms by much\r\nthe greatest of the three; and there seems to be zoölogical as well\r\nas lithological evidence that its formation must have occupied no\r\nbrief period. _The same genera occur in its upper as in its lower\r\nbeds, but the species appear to be different._ I shall briefly state\r\nthe evidence of this very curious fact.\r\n\r\nThe seat of Sir William Gordon Camming, of Altyre, is in the\r\nneighborhood of one of the Morayshire deposits discovered by Mr.\r\nMalcolmson; and for the greater part of the last two years Lady\r\nGordon Gumming has been engaged in making a collection of its\r\npeculiar fossils, which already fills an entire apartment. The object\r\nof her Ladyship was the illustration of the Geology of the district,\r\nand all she sought in it on her own behalf was congenial employment\r\nfor a singularly elegant and comprehensive mind. But her labors have\r\nrendered her a benefactor to science. Her collection was visited,\r\nshortly after the late meeting of the British Association in Glasgow,\r\nby Agassiz and Dr. Buckland; and great was the surprise and delight\r\nof the philosophers to find that the whole was new to Geology. All\r\nthe species, amounting to eleven, and at least one of the genera,\r\nthat of the _Glyptolepis_, were different from any Agassiz had ever\r\nseen or described before. The deposit so successfully explored by\r\nher Ladyship occurs high in the lower formation. Agassiz, shortly\r\nafter, in comparing the collection of Dr. Traill (a collection\r\nformed at Orkney) with that of the writer, (a collection made at\r\nCromarty,) was struck by the specific identity of the specimens. In\r\nthe instances in which the genera agreed, he found that the species\r\nagreed also, though the ichthyolites of both differed specifically\r\nfrom the ichthyolites of Caithness, which occur chiefly in the upper\r\nbeds of the formation, and from those also of Lady Cumming of Altyre,\r\nwhich occur, as I have said, at the top. And in examining into the\r\ncause, it was found that the two collections, though furnished by\r\nlocalities more than a hundred miles apart, were yet derived, if\r\nI may so express myself, from the same low platform, both alike\r\nrepresenting the fossiliferous base of the system, and both removed\r\nbut by a single stage from the great unfossiliferous conglomerate\r\nbelow. Thus there seem to be what may be termed two stories of\r\nbeing in this lower formation--stories in which the groups, though\r\ngenerically identical, are specifically dissimilar.[AK]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AK: Since this period, however, several species identical\r\nwith those of Cromarty have been found in the Morayshire deposits.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Formations of the Old Red Sandstone.--Room, enough for each\r\nand to spare.--Middle, or Cornstone Formation.--The _Cephalaspis_\r\nits most characteristic Organism.--Description.--The Den of\r\nBalruddery richer in the Fossils of this middle Formation than\r\nany other Locality yet discovered.--Various Contemporaries\r\nof the _Cephalaspis_.--Vegetable Impressions.--Gigantic\r\nCrustacean.--_Seraphim._--Ichthyodorulites.--Sketch of the Geology\r\nof Forfarshire.--Its older Deposits of the Cornstone Formation.--The\r\nQuarries of Carmylie.--Their Vegetable and Animal Remains.--The\r\nUpper Formation.--Wide Extent of the Fauna and Flora of the earlier\r\nFormations.--Probable Cause.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have dwelt almost exclusively on the fossils of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone, and the history of their discovery: I shall\r\nnow ascend to the organisms of its higher platforms. The system\r\nin Scotland, as in the sister kingdom, has its middle and upper\r\ngroups, and these are in no degree less curious than the inferior\r\ngroup already described, nor do they more resemble the existences\r\nof the present time. Does the reader remember the illustration of\r\nthe pyramid employed in an early chapter--its three parallel bars,\r\nand the strange hieroglyphics of the middle bar? Let him now imagine\r\nanother pyramid, inscribed with the remaining and later history of\r\nthe system. We read, as before, from the base upwards, but find the\r\nbroken and half-defaced characters of the second erection descending\r\ninto the very soil, as in those obelisks of Egypt round which the\r\nsands of the desert have been accumulating for ages. Hence a hiatus\r\nin our history for future excavators to fill; and it contains\r\nmany such blanks, every unfossiliferous bar in either pyramid\r\nrepresenting a gap in the record. Three distinct formations the\r\ngroup undoubtedly contains--perhaps more; nor will the fact appear\r\nstrange to the reader who remembers how numerous the formations are\r\nthat lie over and under it, and that its vast depth of ten thousand\r\nfeet equals that of the whole secondary system from top to bottom.\r\nEight such formations as the Oolite, or ten such formations as the\r\nChalk, could rest, the one over the other, in the space occupied by a\r\ngroup so enormous. To the evidence of its three distant formations,\r\nwhich is of a very simple character, I shall advert as I go along.\r\n\r\nThe central or Cornstone division of the system in England is\r\ncharacterized throughout its vast depth by a peculiar family of\r\nichthyolites, which occur in none of the other divisions. I have\r\nalready had occasion to refer to the _Cephalaspis_. Four species of\r\nthis fish have been discovered in the Cornstones of Hereford, Salop,\r\nWorcester, Monmouth, and Brecon;[AL] \"and as they are always found,\"\r\nsays Mr. Murchison, \"in the same division of the Old Red System,\r\nthey have become valuable auxiliaries in enabling the geologist to\r\nidentify its subdivisions through England and Wales, and also to\r\ninstitute direct comparisons between the different strata of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone of England and Scotland.\" The _Cephalaspis_ is\r\none of the most curious ichthyolites of the system. (See Plate X.,\r\nfig. 1.) Has the reader ever seen a saddler's cutting knife?--a tool\r\nwith a crescent-shaped blade, and the handle fixed transversely in\r\nthe centre of its concave side. In general outline the _Cephalaspis_\r\nresembled this tool--the crescent-shaped blade representing the head,\r\nthe transverse handle the body. We have but to give the handle\r\nan angular, instead of a rounded shape, and to press together the\r\npointed horns of the crescent, till they incline towards each other,\r\nand the convex, or sharpened edge, is elongated into a semi-ellipse,\r\ncut in the line of its shortest diameter, in order to produce the\r\ncomplete form of the _Cephalaspis_. The head, compared with the body,\r\nwas of great size--comprising fully one third the creature's entire\r\nlength. In the centre, and placed closely together, as in many of the\r\nflat fish, were the eyes. Some of the specimens show two dorsals,\r\nand an anal and caudal fin. The thin and angular body presents a\r\njointed appearance, somewhat like that of a lobster or trilobite.\r\nLike the bodies of most of the ichthyolites of the system, it was\r\ncovered with variously formed scales of bone; the creature's head\r\nwas cased in strong plates of the same material, the whole upper\r\nside lying under one huge buckler--and hence the name _Cephalaspis_,\r\nor buckler-head. In proportion to its strength and size, it seems\r\nto have been amply furnished with weapons of defence. Such was the\r\nstrength and massiveness of its covering, that its remains are found\r\ncomparatively entire in arenaceous rocks impregnated with iron, in\r\nwhich few other fossils could have survived. Its various species, as\r\nthey occur in the Welsh and English Cornstones, says Mr. Murchison,\r\nseem \"not to have been suddenly killed and entombed, but to have\r\nbeen long exposed to submarine agencies, such as the attacks of\r\nanimals, currents, concretionary action,\" &c.; and yet, \"though much\r\ndismembered, the geologist has little difficulty in recognizing even\r\nthe smallest portions of them.\" Nor does it seem to have been quite\r\nunfurnished with offensive weapons. The sword-fish, with its strong\r\nand pointed spear, has been known to perforate the oaken ribs of the\r\nfirmest built vessels; and, poised and directed by its lesser fins,\r\nand impelled by its powerful tail, it may be regarded either as an\r\narrow or javelin flung with tremendous force, or as a knight speeding\r\nto the encounter with his lance in rest. Now there are missiles\r\nemployed in Eastern warfare, which, instead of being pointed like\r\nthe arrow or javelin, are edged somewhat like the crooked falchion\r\nor saddler's cutting-knife, and which are capable of being cast\r\nwith such force, that they have been known to sever a horse's leg\r\nthrough the bone; and if the sword-fish may be properly compared to\r\nan arrow or javelin, the combative powers of the _Cephalaspis_ may be\r\nillustrated, it is probable, by a weapon of this kind--the head all\r\naround its elliptical margin presenting a sharp edge, like that of\r\na cutting-knife, or falchion. Its impetus, however, must have been\r\ncomparatively small, for its organs of motion were so: it was a bolt\r\ncarefully fashioned, but a bolt cast from a feeble bow. But if weak\r\nin the assault, it must have been formidable when assailed. \"The\r\npointed horns of the crescent,\" said Agassiz to the writer, \"seem\r\nto have served a similar purpose with the spear-like wings of the\r\n_Pterichthys_,\"--the sole difference consisting in the circumstance,\r\nthat the spears of the one could be elevated or depressed at\r\npleasure, whereas those of the other were ever fixed in the warlike\r\nattitude. And such was the _Cephalaspis_ of the Cornstones--not only\r\nthe most characteristic, but in England and Wales almost the sole\r\norganism of the formation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AL: _Cephalaspis Lewisii_, _C. Lloydii_, _C. Lyellii_, and\r\n_C. rostratus_.]\r\n\r\nNow of this curious ichthyolite we find no trace among the fossils\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone. It occurs neither in Orkney nor\r\nCromarty, Caithness nor Gamrie, Nairnshire nor the inferior\r\nichthyolite beds of Moray. Neither in England nor in Scotland is it\r\nto be found in the Tilestone formation, or its equivalent. It is\r\ncommon, however, in the Old Red Sandstone of Forfarshire; and it\r\noccurs at Balruddery, in the Gray Sandstones which form on both\r\nsides the Tay, where the Tilestone formation seems wanting, the\r\napparent base of the system. It is exclusively a medal of the middle\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nIn the last-mentioned locality, in a beautifully wooded dell, known\r\nas the Den of Balruddery, the _Cephalaspis_ is found associated\r\nwith an entire group of other fossils, the recent discovery of Mr.\r\nWebster, the proprietor, who, with a zeal through which geological\r\nknowledge promises to be materially extended, and at an expense of\r\nmuch labor, has made a collection of all the organisms of the Den yet\r\ndiscovered. These the writer had the pleasure of examining in the\r\ncompany of Mr. Murchison and Dr. Buckland: he was afterwards present\r\nwhen they were examined by Agassiz; and not a single organism of the\r\ngroup could be identified on either occasion, by any member of the\r\nparty, with those of the lower or upper formations. Even the genera\r\nare dissimilar. The fossils of the Lias scarce differ more from\r\nthose of the Coal Measures, than the fossils of the Middle Old Red\r\nSandstone from the fossils of the formations that rest over and under\r\nthem. Each formation has its distinct group--a fact so important\r\nto the geologist, that he may feel an interest in its further\r\nverification through the decision of yet another high authority. The\r\nsuperior Old Red Sandstones of Scotland were first ascertained to be\r\nfossiliferous by Professor Fleming, of King's College, Aberdeen,[AM]\r\nconfessedly one of the first naturalists of the age, and who,\r\nto his minute acquaintance with existing forms of being, adds an\r\nacquaintance scarcely less minute with those forms of primeval life\r\nthat no longer exist. He it was who first discovered, in the Upper\r\nOld Red Sandstones of Fifeshire, the large scales and plates of that\r\nstrikingly characteristic ichthyolite of the higher formation, now\r\nknown as the _Holoptychius_--of which more anon; and, unquestionably,\r\nno one acquainted with his writings, or the character of his mind,\r\ncan doubt that he examined carefully.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AM: The Upper Old Red Sandstones of Moray were ascertained\r\nto be fossiliferous at nearly the same time by Mr. Martin, of the\r\nAnderson Institution, Elgin. There is a mouldering conglomerate\r\nprecipice termed the _Scat-Craig_, about four miles to the south of\r\nthe town, more abundant in remains than perhaps any of the other\r\ndeposits of the formation yet discovered; and in this precipice\r\nMr. Martin first commenced his labors in the lied Sandstone of the\r\ndistrict, and found it a mine of wonders. It is a place of singular\r\ninterest--a rock of sepulchres; and its teeth, scales, and single\r\nbones occur in a state of great entireness; though, ere the deposit\r\nwas formed, the various ichthyolites whose remains it contains seem\r\nto have been broken up, and their fragments scattered. Accumulations\r\nof larger and smaller pebbles alternate in the strata; and the\r\nbulkier bones and teeth are found invariably among the bulkier\r\npebbles, thus showing that they were operated upon by the same laws\r\nof motion which operated on the inorganic contents of the deposit.\r\nAt a considerably later period the fossils of the upper group were\r\ndetected in the precipitous and romantic banks of the Findhorn, by\r\nDr. Malcolmson, of Madras, when prosecuting his discoveries of the\r\norganisms of the lower formation. He found them, also, though in less\r\nabundance, in a splendid section exhibited in the Burn of Lethen, a\r\nrivulet of Moray, and yet again in the neighborhood of Altyre. The\r\nRev. Mr. Gordon, of Birnie, and Mr. Robertson, of Inverugie, have\r\nbeen also discoverers in the district. To the geological labors\r\nof Mr. Patrick Duff, of Elgin, in the same field, I have already\r\nhad occasion incidentally to refer. The patient inquiries of this\r\ngentleman have been prosecuted for years in all the formations of the\r\nprovince, from the Weald of Linksfield, with its peculiar lacustrine\r\nremains--lignites, minute fresh-water shells, and the teeth, spines,\r\nand vertebræ of fish and saurians--down to the base of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, with its _Coccostei_, _Dipteri_, and _Pterichthyes_. His\r\nacquaintance with the organisms of the _Scat-Craig_ is at once more\r\nextensive and minute than that of, perhaps, any other geologist;\r\nand his collection of them very valuable, representing, as it does,\r\na formation of much interest, still little known. Mr. Duff is at\r\npresent engaged on a volume descriptive of the Geology of the\r\nprovince of Moray, a district extensively explored of late years, and\r\nabundant in its distinct groups of organisms, but of which general\r\nreaders have still much to learn; and from no one could they learn\r\nmore regarding it than from Mr. Duff. It is still only a few months\r\nsince the Upper Old Red Sandstones of the southern districts of\r\nScotland were found to be fossiliferous; and the writer is chiefly\r\nindebted for his acquaintance with their organisms to a tradesman of\r\nBerwickshire, Mr. William Stevenson, of Dunse, who, on perusing some\r\nof the geological articles which appeared in the Witness newspaper\r\nduring the course of the last autumn, sent him a parcel of fossils\r\ndisinterred from out the deep belt of Red Sandstone which leans to\r\nthe south in that locality, against the grauwacke of the Lammermuirs.\r\nMr. Stevenson had recently discovered them, he stated, near\r\nPreston-haugh, about two miles north of Dunse, in a fine section of\r\nalternating Sandstone and conglomerate strata that lie unconformably\r\non the grauwacke. They consist of scales and occipital plates of the\r\n_Holoptychius_, with the remains of a bulky, but very imperfectly\r\npreserved ichthyodorulite; and the coarse, arenaceous matrices which\r\nsurround them seem identical with the red gritty Sandstones of the\r\nFindhorn and the _Scat-Craig_,]\r\n\r\nNow, a few years since, I had the pleasure of introducing Professor\r\nFleming to the Organisms of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, as they\r\noccur in the neighborhood of Cromarty; and, notwithstanding his\r\nextensive acquaintance with the upper fossils of the system, he\r\nfound himself, among the lower, in an entirely new field. His\r\nknowledge of the one group served but to show him how very different\r\nit was from the other. With the organisms of the lower he minutely\r\nacquainted himself; he collected specimens from Gamrie, Caithness,\r\nand Cromarty, and studied their peculiarities; and yet, on being\r\nintroduced last year to the discoveries of Mr. Webster at Balruddery,\r\nhe found his acquaintance with both the upper and lower groups\r\nstand him in but the same stead that his first acquired knowledge\r\nof the upper group had stood him a few years before. He agreed\r\nwith Agassiz in pronouncing the group at Balruddery essentially a\r\nnew group. Add to this evidence the well weighed testimony of Mr.\r\nMurchison regarding the three formations which the Old Red Sandstone\r\ncontains in England, where the entire system is found continuous, the\r\nCornstone overlying the Tilestone, and the Quartzose conglomerate the\r\nCornstone; take into account the fact that, there, each formation has\r\nits characteristic fossil, identical with some characteristic fossil\r\nof the corresponding formation of Scotland--that the Tilestones of\r\nthe one, and the lower group of the other, have their _Dipterus_\r\nin common--that the Cornstones of the one, and the middle group of\r\nthe other, have their _Cephalaspis_ in common--that the Quartzose\r\nconglomerate of the one, and the upper group of the other, have their\r\n_Holoptychius_ in common; and then say whether the proofs of distinct\r\nsucceeding formations can be more surely established. If, however,\r\nthe reader still entertain a doubt, let him consult the singularly\r\ninstructive section of the entire system, from the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone to the Upper Silurian, given by Mr. Murchison, in his\r\n_Silurian System_, (Part II., Plate XXXI., fig. 1,) and he will find\r\nthe doubt vanish. But to return to the fossils of the Cornstone group.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic fossil of this deposit, the _Cephalaspis_, occurs\r\nin considerable abundance in Forfarshire, and in a much more entire\r\nstate than in the Cornstones of England and Wales. The rocks to\r\nwhich it belongs are also developed, though more sparingly, in\r\nthe northern extremity of Fife, in a line parallel to the southern\r\nshores of the Tay. But of all the localities yet known, the Den of\r\nBalruddery is that in which the peculiar organisms of the formation\r\nmay be studied with best effect. The oryctology of the Cornstones\r\nof England seems restricted to four species of the _Cephalaspis_.\r\nIn Fife, all the organisms of the formation yet discovered are\r\nexclusively vegetable--darkened impressions of stems like those\r\nof the inferior ichthyolite beds, confusedly mixed with what seem\r\nslender and pointed leaflets drawn in black, and numerous circular\r\nforms, which have been deemed the remains of the seed-vessels of\r\nsome unknown sub-aerial plant. \"These last occur,\" says Professor\r\nFleming, the original discoverer, \"in the form of circular flat\r\npatches, not equalling an inch in diameter, and composed of numerous\r\nsmaller contiguous circular pieces;\" the _tout ensemble_ resembling\r\n\"what might be expected to result from a compressed berry, such\r\nas the bramble or the rasp.\" In Forfarshire, the remains of the\r\n_Cephalaspis_ are found associated with impressions of a different\r\ncharacter, though equally obscure--impressions of polished surfaces\r\ncarved into seeming scales; but in Balruddery alone are the vegetable\r\nimpressions of the one locality, and the scaly impressions of the\r\nother, together with the characteristic ichthyolites of England and\r\nForfarshire, found associated with numerous fossils besides, many of\r\nthem obscure, but all of them of interest, and all of them new to\r\nGeology.\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest organisms of the formation is a fossil lobster,\r\nof such huge proportions, that one of the average sized lobsters,\r\ncommon in our markets, might stretch its entire length across the\r\ncontinuous tail-flap in which the creature terminated. And it is a\r\nmarked characteristic of the fossil, that the terminal flap should\r\nbe continuous; in all the existing varieties with which I am\r\nacquainted, it is divided into angular sections. The claws nearly\r\nresembled those of the common lobster; their outline is similar;\r\nthere is the same hawk-bill curvature outside, and the inner sides of\r\nthe pincers are armed with similar teeth-like tubercles. The immense\r\nshield which covered the upper part of the creature's body is more\r\nangular than in the existing varieties, and resembles, both in form\r\nand size, one of those lozenge-shaped shields worn by knights of the\r\nmiddle ages on gala days, rather for ornament than use, and on which\r\nthe herald still inscribes the armorial bearing of ladies who bear\r\ntitle in their own right. As shown in some of the larger specimens,\r\nthe length of this gigantic crustacean must have exceeded four feet.\r\nIts shelly armor was delicately fretted with the forms of circular or\r\nelliptical scales. On all the many plates of which it was composed we\r\nsee these described by gracefully waved lines, and rising apparently\r\nfrom under one another, row beyond row. They were, however, as much\r\nthe mere semblance of scales as those relieved by the sculptor on the\r\ncorslet of a warrior's effigy on a Gothic tomb--mere sculpturings\r\non the surface of the shell. This peculiarity may be regarded as\r\nthrowing light on the hitherto doubtful impressions of the sandstone\r\nof Forfarshire--impressions, as has been said, of smooth surfaces\r\ncarved into seeming scales. They occur as impressions merely, the\r\nsandstone retaining no more of the original substance of the organism\r\nthan the impressed wax does of the substance of the seal; and the\r\nworkmen in the quarries in which they occur, finding form without\r\nbody, and struck by the resemblance which the delicately waved\r\nscales bear to the sculptured markings on the wings of cherubs--of\r\nall subjects of the chisel the most common--fancifully termed them\r\n_Seraphim_. They have turned out, as was anticipated, to be the\r\ndetached plates of some such crustacean as the lobster of Balruddery.\r\n\r\nThe ability displayed by Cuvier in restoring, from a few broken\r\nfragments of bone, the skeleton of the entire animal to which\r\nthe fragments had belonged, astonished the world He had learned\r\nto interpret signs as incomprehensible to every one else as the\r\nmysterious handwriting on the wall had been to the courtiers of\r\nBelshazzar. The condyle of a jaw became in his hands a key to\r\nthe character of the original possessor; and in a few mouldering\r\nvertebræ, or in the dilapidated bones of a fore-arm or a foot, he\r\ncould read a curious history of habits and instincts. In common\r\nwith several gentlemen of Edinburgh, all men known to science, I\r\nwas as much struck with the skill displayed by Agassiz in piecing\r\ntogether the fragments of the huge crustacean of Balruddery, and\r\nin demonstrating its nature as such. The numerous specimens of Mr.\r\nWebster were opened out before us. On a previous morning I had\r\nexamined them, as I have said, in the company of Mr. Murchison and\r\nDr. Buckland; they had been seen also by Lord Greenock, Dr. Traill,\r\nand Mr. Charles M'Laren; and their fragments of new and undescribed\r\nfishes had been at once recognized with reference to at least their\r\nclass. But the collection contained organisms of a different kind,\r\nwhich seemed inexplicable to all--forms of various design, but so\r\nregularly mathematical in their outlines that they might be all\r\ndescribed by a ruler and a pair of compasses, and yet the whole were\r\ncovered by seeming scales. There were the fragments of scaly rhombs,\r\nof scaly crescents, of scaly circles, with scaly parallelograms\r\nattached to them, and of several other regular compound figures\r\nbesides. Mr. Murchison, familiar with the older fossils, remarked the\r\nclose resemblance of the seeming scales to those of the _Seraphim_\r\nof Forfarshire, but deferred the whole to the judgment of Agassiz; no\r\none else hazarded a conjecture. Agassiz glanced over the collection.\r\nOne specimen especially caught his attention--an elegantly\r\nsymmetrical one. It seemed a combination of the parallelogram and\r\nthe crescent: there were pointed horns at each end; but the convex\r\nand concave lines of the opposite sides passed into almost parallel\r\nright lines towards the centre. His eye brightened as he contemplated\r\nit. \"I will tell you,\" he said, turning to the company--\"I will tell\r\nyou what these are--the remains of a huge lobster.\" He arranged\r\nthe specimens in the group before him with as much apparent ease\r\nas I have seen a young girl arranging the pieces of ivory or\r\nmother-of-pearl in an Indian puzzle. A few broken pieces completed\r\nthe lozenge-shaped shield; two detached specimens, placed on its\r\nopposite sides, furnished the claws; two or three semi-rings, with\r\nserrated edges, composed the jointed body; the compound figure,\r\nwhich but a minute before had so strongly attracted his attention,\r\nfurnished the terminal flap; and there lay the huge lobster before\r\nus, palpable to all. There is homage due to supereminent genius,\r\nwhich nature spontaneously pays when there are no low feelings of\r\nenvy or jealousy to interfere with her operations; and the reader may\r\nwell believe that it was willingly rendered on this occasion to the\r\ngenius of Agassiz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE IX._]\r\n\r\nThe terminal flap of this gigantic crustacean was, as I have said,\r\ncontinuous. The creature, however, seems to have had contemporaries\r\nof the same family, whose construction in the divisions of the\r\nflap resembled more the lobsters of the present day; and the\r\nreader may see in the subjoined print the representation of a very\r\ncharacteristic fragment of an animal of this commoner type, from\r\nthe Middle Sandstones of Forfarshire. (See Plate IX., fig. 1.) It\r\nis a terminal flap--one of several divisions--curiously fretted by\r\nscale-like markings, and bearing on its lower edge a fringe, cut\r\ninto angular points, somewhat in the style of the Vandyke edgings\r\nof a ruff or the lacings of a dead-dress. It may be remarked, in\r\npassing, that our commoner lobsters bear, on the corresponding edge,\r\nfringes of strong, reddish-colored hair. The form altogether, from\r\nits wing-like appearance, its feathery markings, and its angular\r\npoints, will suggest to the reader the origin of the name given it by\r\nthe Forfarshire workmen. With another such flap spreading out in the\r\ncontrary direction, and a periwigged head between them, we would have\r\none of the sandstone cherubs of our country churchyards complete.\r\n\r\nThere occur among the other organisms of Balruddery numerous\r\nichthyodorulites--fin-spines, such as those to which I have called\r\nthe attention of the reader in describing the thorny-finned fish of\r\nthe lower formation. But the ichthyodorulites of Balruddery differ\r\nessentially from those of Caithness, Moray, and Cromarty. These\r\nlast are described on both sides, in every instance, by either\r\nstraight, or slightly curved lines; whereas one of the describing\r\nlines in a Balruddery variety is broken by projecting prickles, that\r\nresemble sharp, hooked teeth set in a jaw, or, rather, the entire\r\nichthyodorulite resembles the sprig of a wild rose-bush, bearing\r\nits peculiar aquiline shaped thorns on one of its sides. Buckland,\r\nin his _Bridgewater Treatise_, and Lyell, in his _Elements_, refer\r\nto this peculiarity of structure in ichthyodorulites of the latter\r\nformations. The hooks are invariably ranged on the concave or\r\nposterior edge of the spine, and were employed, it is supposed,\r\nin elevating the fin. Another ichthyodorulite of the formation\r\nresembles, in the Gothic cast of its roddings, those of the\r\n_Diplacanthus_ of the Lower Old Red Sandstone described in pages 125\r\nand 126 of the present volume, and figured in Plate VIII., fig. 2,\r\nexcept that it was proportionally stouter, and traversed at its base\r\nby lines running counter to the striæ that furrow it longitudinally.\r\nOf the other organisms of Balruddery I cannot pretend to speak with\r\nany degree of certainty. Some of them seem to have belonged to the\r\n_Radiata_; some are of so doubtful a character that it can scarce\r\nbe determined whether they took their place among the forms of the\r\nvegetable or animal kingdoms. One organism in particular, which was\r\nat first deemed the jointed stem of some plant resembling a calamite\r\nof the Coal Measures, was found by Agassiz to be the slender limb\r\nof a crustacean. A minute description of this interesting deposit,\r\nwith illustrative prints, would be of importance to science: it would\r\nserve to fill a gap in the scale. The geological pathway, which\r\nleads upwards to the present time from those ancient formations in\r\nwhich organic existence first began, has been the work of well nigh\r\nas many hands as some of our longer railroads: each contractor has\r\ntaken his part; very extended parts have fallen to the share of some,\r\nand admirably have they executed them; but the pathway is not yet\r\ncomplete, and the completion of a highly curious portion of it awaits\r\nthe further labors of Mr. Webster, of Balruddery.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the rocks of this middle formation in\r\nScotland are of a bluish-gray color: in Balruddery, they resemble\r\nthe mudstones of the Silurian System; they form at Carmylie the\r\nfissile, bluish-gray pavement, so well known in commerce as the\r\npavement of Arbroath; they occur as a hard, micaceous building-stone\r\nin some parts of Fifeshire; in others they exist as beds of friable,\r\nstratified clay, that dissolve into unctuous masses where washed by\r\nthe sea. In England, the formation consists, throughout its entire\r\ndepth, of beds of red and green marl, with alternating beds of the\r\nnodular limestones, to which it owes its name, and with here and\r\nthere an interposing band of indurated sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe Cornstone formation is more extensively developed in Forfarshire\r\nthan in any other district in Scotland; and from this circumstance\r\nthe result of the writer's observations regarding it, during the\r\ncourse of a recent visit, may be of some little interest to the\r\nreader. About two thirds the entire area of this county is composed\r\nof Old Red Sandstone. It forms a portion of that great belt of the\r\nsystem which, extending across the island from the German Ocean to\r\nthe Frith of Clyde, represents the southern bar of the huge sandstone\r\nframe in which the Highlands of Scotland is set. The Grampians run\r\nalong its inner edge--composing part of the primary nucleus which the\r\nframe encloses: the Sidlaw Hills run through its centre in a line\r\nnearly parallel to these, and separated from them by Strathmore, the\r\ngreat valley of Angus. The valley and the hills thus form, if I may\r\nso express myself, the mouldings of the frame--mouldings somewhat\r\nresembling the semi-recta of the architect. There is first, reckoning\r\nfrom the mountains downwards, an immense concave curve--the valley;\r\nthen an immense convex one--the hills; and then a half curve bounded\r\nby the sea. The illustration may further serve to show the present\r\ncondition of the formation: it is a frame much worn by denudation,\r\nand--just as in a _bona fide_ frame--it is the higher mouldings that\r\nhave suffered most. Layer after layer has been worn down on the\r\nridges, exactly as on a raised moulding we may see the gold leaf, the\r\nred pigment, and the whiting, all ground down to the wood; while in\r\nthe hollow moulding beside it, on the contrary, the gilt is still\r\nfresh and entire. We find in the hollows the superior layers of the\r\nframe still overlying the inferior ones, and on the heights the\r\ninferior ones laid bare. To descend in the system, therefore, we have\r\nto climb a hill--to rise in it, we have to descend into a valley. We\r\nfind the lowest beds of the system any where yet discovered in the\r\ncounty on the moory heights of Carmylie; its newer deposits may be\r\nfound on the sea-shore, beside the limeworks of Hedderwick, and in\r\nthe central hollows of Strathmore.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient beds in the county yet known belong, as\r\nunequivocally shown by their fossils, to but the middle formation of\r\nthe system. They have been quarried for many years in the parish of\r\nCarmylie; and the quarries, as may be supposed, are very extensive,\r\nstretching along a moory hill-side for considerably more than a mile,\r\nand furnishing employment to from sixty to a hundred workmen. The\r\neye is first caught, in approaching them, as we surmount a long,\r\nflat ridge, which shuts them out from the view of the distant sea,\r\nby what seems a line of miniature windmills, the sails flaring with\r\nred lead, and revolving with the lightest breeze at more than double\r\nthe rate of the sails of ordinary mills. These are employed--a\r\nlesson probably borrowed from the Dutch--in draining the quarries,\r\nand throw up a very considerable body of water. The line of the\r\nexcavations resembles a huge drain, with nearly perpendicular\r\nsides--a consequence of the regular and well-determined character of\r\nthe joints with which the strata are bisected. The stone itself is\r\na gray, close-grained fissile sandstone, of unequal hardness, and\r\nso very tough and coherent--qualities which it seems to owe in part\r\nto the vast abundance of mica which it contains--that it is quite\r\npossible to strike a small hammer through some of the larger flags,\r\nwithout shattering the edges of the perforation. Hence its value for\r\nvarious purposes which common sandstone is too brittle and incoherent\r\nto serve. It is extensively used in the neighborhood as a roofing\r\nslate; it is employed, too, in the making of water cisterns, grooved\r\nand jointed as if wrought out of wood, and for the tops of lobby and\r\nbilliard tables. I have even seen snuff-boxes fashioned out of it,\r\nas a sort of mechanical feat by the workmen,--a purpose, however,\r\nwhich it seems to serve only indifferently well,--and single slabs\r\nof it cut into tolerably neat window frames for cottages. It is most\r\nextensively used, however, merely as a paving-stone for lobbies and\r\nlower floors, and the footways of streets. When first deposited,\r\nand when the creatures whose organic remains it still preserves\r\ncareered over its numerous platforms, it seems to have existed as\r\na fine, muddy sand, formed apparently of disintegrated grauwacke\r\nrocks, analogous in their mineral character to the similarly colored\r\ngrauwacke of the Lammermuirs, or of primary slates ground down by\r\nattrition into mud, and mixed up with the pulverized fragments of\r\nschistose gneiss and mica schist.\r\n\r\nI was first struck, on descending among the workmen, by the\r\ncomparative abundance of the vegetable remains. In some parts of the\r\nquarries almost every layer of the strata is covered by carbonaceous\r\nmarkings--irregularly grooved stems, branching oat into boughs\r\nat acute angles, and that at the first glance seem the miniature\r\nsemblances of the trunks of gnarled oaks and elms, blackened in a\r\nmorass, and still retaining the rough bark, chapped into furrows:\r\noblong, leaf-like impressions, too, and impressions of more slender\r\nform, that resemble the narrow, parallel edged leaves of the\r\nsea-grass weed. I observed, in particular, one large bunch of\r\nriband-like leaflets converging into a short stem, so that the whole\r\nresembled a scourge of cords; and I would fain have detached it from\r\nthe rock, but it lay on a mouldering film of clay, and broke up with\r\nmy first attempt to remove it. A stalk of sea-grass weed plucked up\r\nby the roots, and compressed in a herbarium, would present a somewhat\r\nsimilar appearance. Among the impressions there occur irregularly\r\nshaped patches, reticulated into the semblance of polygonal meshes.\r\nThey remind one of pieces of ill-woven lace; for the meshes are\r\nunequal in size, and the polygons irregular. (See Plate IX., fig.\r\n2.) When first laid open, every mesh is filled with a carbonaceous\r\nspeck; and from their supposed resemblance to the eggs of the frog,\r\nthe workmen term them _puddock spawn_. They are supposed by Mr.\r\nLyell to form the remains of the eggs of some gasteropodous mollusc\r\nof the period. I saw one flagstone, in particular, so covered with\r\nthese reticulated patches, and so abundant, besides, in vegetable\r\nimpressions of both the irregularly furrowed and grass-weed-looking\r\nclass, that I could compare it to only the bottom of a ditch beside\r\na hedge, matted with withered grass, strewed with blackened twigs of\r\nthe hawthorn, and mottled with detached masses of the eggs of the\r\nfrog. All the larger vegetables are resolved into as pure a coal\r\nas the plants of the Coal Measures themselves--the kind of data,\r\ndoubtless, on which unfortunate coal speculators have often earned\r\ndisappointment at large expense. None of the vegetables themselves,\r\nhowever, in the least resemble those of the carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nThe animal remains, though less numerous, are more interesting. They\r\nare identical with those of the Den of Balruddery. I saw, in the\r\npossession of the superintendent of the quarries, a well-preserved\r\nhead of the _Cephalaspis Lyellii_. The crescent-shaped horns were\r\nwanting, and the outline a little obscure; but the eyes were better\r\nmarked than in almost any other specimen I have yet seen, and the\r\ncircular star-like tubercles which roughen the large occipital\r\nbuckler, to which the creature owes its name, were tolerably well\r\ndefined. I was shown the head of another individual of the same\r\nspecies in the centre of a large slab, and nothing could be more\r\nentire than the outline. The osseous plate still retained the\r\noriginal brownish-white hue of the bone, and its radiated porous\r\ntexture; and the sharp crescent-shaped horns were as sharply defined\r\nas during the lifetime of the strangely organized creature which they\r\nhad defended. In both specimens the thin angular body was wanting.\r\nLike almost all the other fish of the Old Red Sandstone, the bony\r\nskeleton of the _Cephalaspis_ was external--as much so as the shell\r\nof the crab or lobster: it presented at all points an armor of bone,\r\nas complete as if it had been carved by the ivory-turner out of a\r\nsolid block; while the internal skeleton, which in every instance\r\nhas disappeared, seems to have been composed of cartilage. I have\r\ncompared its general appearance to a saddler's cutting-knife;--I\r\nshould, perhaps, have said a saddler's cutting-knife divested of\r\nthe wooden handle--the broad, bony head representing the blade, and\r\nthe thin angular body the iron stem usually fixed in the wood. No\r\nexistence of the present creation at all resembles the _Cephalaspis_.\r\nWere we introduced to the living creatures which now inhabit the\r\noceans and rivers of Mars and Venus, we could find nothing among them\r\nmore strange in appearance, or more unlike our living acquaintances\r\nof the friths and streams, than the _Cephalaspides_ of Carmylie.\r\n\r\nI observed, besides, in the quarry, remains of the huge crustacean\r\nof Balruddery. The plates of the _Cephalaspis_ retain the color of\r\nthe original bone; the plates of the crustacean, on the contrary,\r\nare of a deep red tint, which contrasts strongly with the cold gray\r\nof the stone. They remind one, both in shape and hue, of pieces of\r\nancient iron armor, fretted into semi-elliptical scales, and red\r\nwith rust. I saw with one of the workmen what seemed to have been\r\nthe continuous tail-flap of an individual of very considerable size.\r\nIt seemed curiously puckered where it had joined to the body, much\r\nin the manner that a gown or Highlander's kilt is puckered where\r\nit joins to the waistband; and the outline of the whole plate was\r\nmarked by what I may venture to term architectural elegance. The\r\nmathematician could have described it with his ruler and compasses.\r\nThe superintendent pointed out to me another plate in a slab\r\ndressed for a piece of common pavement. It was a regularly formed\r\nparallelogram, and had obviously composed one of the jointed plates\r\nwhich had covered the creature's body. I could not so easily assign\r\nits place to yet a third plate in the possession of the Rev. Mr.\r\nWilson, of Carmylie. It is colored, like the others, and like them,\r\ntoo, fretted into minute scales, but the form is exactly that of\r\na heart--not such a heart as the anatomist would draw, but such\r\na heart, rather, as we see at times on valentines of the humbler\r\norder, or on the ace of hearts in a pack of cards. Possibly enough\r\nit may have been the breastplate of this antique crustacean of\r\nthe Cornstones. The spawn of our common blue lobster is composed\r\nof spherical black grains, of nearly the size of mustard-seed. It\r\nstruck me as not very improbable that the reticulated markings of the\r\nflagstones of Carmylie may have been produced by the minute eggs of\r\nthis fossil crustacean, covered up by some hastily deposited layer of\r\nmingled mud and sand, and forced into the polygonal form by pressing\r\nagainst each other, and by the weight from above.\r\n\r\nThe gray fissile bed in which these organisms occur was perforated\r\nto its base on two several occasions, and in different parts of the\r\nquarries--in one instance, merely to ascertain its depth; in the\r\nother, in the course of excavating a tunnel. In the one case it was\r\nfound to rest on a bed of trap, which seemed to have insinuated\r\nitself among the strata with as little disturbance, and which lay\r\nnearly as conformably to them as the greenstone bed of Salisbury\r\nCrags does to the alternating sandstones and clays which both\r\nunderlie and overtop it. In the other instance the excavators arrived\r\nat a red, aluminous sandstone, veined by a purplish-colored oxide of\r\niron. The upper strata of the quarry are overlaid by a thick bed of\r\ngrayish-red conglomerate.\r\n\r\nLeaving behind us the quarries of Carmylie, we descend the hill-side,\r\nand rise in the system as we lower our level and advance upon the\r\nsea. For a very considerable distance we find the rock covered up by\r\na deep-red diluvial clay, largely charged with water-worn boulders,\r\nchiefly of the older primary rocks, and of the sandstone underneath.\r\nThe soil on the higher grounds is moory and barren--a consequence,\r\nin great part, of a hard, ferruginous pan, which interposes like\r\na paved floor between the diluvium and the upper mould, and which\r\nprevents the roots of the vegetation from striking downwards into\r\nthe tenacious subsoil. From its impervious character, too, it has\r\nthe effect of rendering the surface a bog for one half the year,\r\nand an arid, sun-baked waste for the other. It seems not improbable\r\nthat the heaths which must have grown and decayed on these heights\r\nfor many ages, may have been main agents in the formation of this\r\npavement of barrenness. Of all plants, they are said to contain most\r\niron. According to Fourcroy, a full twelfth part of the weight of\r\noak, when dried, is owing to the presence of this almost universally\r\ndiffused metal; and the proportion in our common heaths is still\r\nlarger. It seems easy to conceive how that, as generation after\r\ngeneration withered on these heights, and were slowly resolved into\r\na little mossy dust, the minute metallic particles which they had\r\ncontained would be carried downwards by the rains through the lighter\r\nstratum of soil, till, reaching the impermeable platform of tenacious\r\nclay beneath, they would gradually accumulate there, and at length\r\nbind its upper layer, as is the nature of ferruginous oxide, into a\r\ncontinuous stony crust. Bog iron, and the clay ironstone, so abundant\r\nin the Coal Measures, and so extensively employed in our iron-works,\r\nseem to have owed their accumulation in layers and nodules to a\r\nsomewhat similar process, through the agency of vegetation. But I\r\ndigress.\r\n\r\nThe rock appears in the course of the Elliot, a few hundred yards\r\nabove the pastoral village of Arbirlot. We find it uptilted on\r\na mass of claystone amygdaloid, that has here raised its broad\r\nback to the surface amid the middle shales and sandstones of the\r\nsystem. The stream runs over the intruded mass; and where the latter\r\nterminates, and the sandstones lean against it, the waters leap\r\nfrom the harder to the softer rock, immediately beside the quiet\r\nparish burying-ground, in a cascade of some eight or ten feet. From\r\nthis point, for a full mile downwards, we find an almost continuous\r\nsection of the sandstone--stratum leaning against stratum--in an\r\nangle of about thirty. The portion of the system thus exhibited must\r\namount to many hundred yards in vertical extent; but as I could\r\ndiscover no data by which to determine regarding the space which\r\nmay intervene between its lowest stratum and the still lower beds\r\nof Carmylie, I could form no guess respecting the thickness of\r\nthe whole. In a bed of shale, about a quarter of a mile below the\r\nvillage, I detected several of the vegetable impressions of Carmylie,\r\nespecially those of the grass-weed looking class, and an imperfectly\r\npreserved organism resembling the parallelogramical scale of a\r\n_Cephalaspis_. The same plants and animals seem to have existed on\r\nthis high platform as on the Carmylie platform far beneath.\r\n\r\nA little farther down the course of the stream, and in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of the old weather-worn tower of the Ouchterlonies,\r\nthere occurs what seems a break in the strata. The newer sandstones\r\nseem to rest unconformably on the older sandstones which they\r\noverlie. The evening on which I explored the course of the Elliot\r\nwas drizzly and unpleasant, and the stream swollen by a day of\r\ncontinuous rain, and so I could not examine so minutely as in other\r\ncircumstances I would have done, or as was necessary to establish\r\nthe fact. In since turning over the _Elements_ of Lyell, however, I\r\nfind, in his section of Forfarshire, that a newer deposit of nearly\r\nhorizontal strata of sandstone and conglomerate lies unconformably,\r\nin the neighborhood of the sea, on the older sandstones of the\r\ndistrict; and the appearances observed near the old tower mark, it is\r\nprobable, one of the points of junction--a point of junction also,\r\nif I may be so bold as venture the suggestion, of the formation\r\nof the _Holoptychius nobilissimus_ with the formation of the\r\n_Cephalaspis_--of the quartzose conglomerate with the Cornstones. In\r\nmy hurried survey, however, I could find none of the scales or plates\r\nof the newer ichthyolite in this upper deposit, though the numerous\r\nspherical markings of white, with their centrical points of darker\r\ncolor, show that at one time the organisms of these upper beds must\r\nhave been very abundant.\r\n\r\nWe pass to the upper formation of the system. Over the belt of\r\nmingled gray and red there occurs in the pyramid a second deep belt\r\nof red conglomerate and variegated sandstone, with a band of lime\r\na-top, and over the band a thick belt of yellow sandstone, with\r\nwhich the system terminates.[AN] Thus the second pyramid consists\r\nmineralogically, like the first, of three great divisions, or\r\nbands; its two upper belts belonging, like the three belts of the\r\nother, to but one formation--the formation known in England as the\r\nQuartzose Conglomerate. It is largely developed in Scotland. We\r\nfind it spread over extensive areas in Moray, Fife, Roxburgh, and\r\nBerwick shires. In England, it is comparatively barren in fossils;\r\nthe only animal organic remains yet detected in it being a single\r\nscale of the _Holoptychius_ found by Mr. Murchison; and though it\r\ncontains vegetable organisms in more abundance, so imperfectly\r\nare they preserved, that little else can be ascertained regarding\r\nthem than that they were land plants, but not identical with the\r\nplants of the Coal Measures. In Scotland, the formation is richly\r\nfossiliferous, and the remains belong chiefly to the animal kingdom.\r\nIt is richly fossiliferous, too, in Russia, where it was discovered\r\nby Mr. Murchison, during the summer of last year, spread over areas\r\nmany thousand square miles in extent. And there, as in Scotland, the\r\n_Holoptychius_ seems its most characteristic fossil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AN: There still exists some uncertainty regarding the\r\norder in which the upper beds occur. Mr. Duff, of Elgin, places the\r\nlimestone band above the yellow sandstone; Messrs. Sedgwick and\r\nMurchison assign it an intermediate position between the red and\r\nyellow. The respective places of the gray and red sandstones are also\r\ndisputed, and by very high authorities; Dr. Fleming holding that the\r\ngray sandstones overlie the red, (see _Cheek's Edinburgh Journal_\r\nfor February, 1831,) and Mr. Lyell, that the red sandstones overlie\r\nthe gray, (see _Elements of Geology_, first edit., pp. 99-100.) The\r\norder adopted above consorts best with the results of the writer's\r\nobservations, which have, however, been restricted chiefly to the\r\nnorth country. He assigns to the limestone band the middle place\r\nassigned to it by Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison, and to the gray\r\nsandstone the inferior position assigned to it by Mr. Lyell; aware,\r\nhowever, that the latter deposit has not only a coping, but also a\r\nbasement, of red sandstone--the basement forming the upper member of\r\nthe lower formation.]\r\n\r\nThe fact seems especially worthy of remark. The organisms of some of\r\nthe newer formations differ entirely, in widely separated localities,\r\nfrom their contemporary organisms, just as, in the existing state\r\nof things, the plants and animals of Great Britain differ from the\r\nplants and animals of Lapland or of Sierra Leone. A geologist who\r\nhas acquainted himself with the belemnites, baculites, turrilites,\r\nand sea-urchins of the Cretaceous group in England and the north\r\nof France, would discover that he had got into an entirely new\r\nfield among the hippurites, sphærulites, and nummulites of the same\r\nformations, in Greece, Italy, and Spain; nor, in passing the tertiary\r\ndeposits, would he find less striking dissimilarities between the\r\ngigantic, mail-clad megatherium and huge mastodon of the Ohio and\r\nthe La Plate, and the monsters, their contemporaries, the hairy\r\nmammoth of Siberia, and the hippopotamus and rhinoceros of England\r\nand the Continent. In the more ancient geological periods, ere the\r\nseasons began, the case is essentially different; the contemporary\r\nformations, when widely separated, are often very unlike in\r\nmineralogical character, but in their fossil contents they are almost\r\nalways identical. In these earlier ages, the atmospheric temperature\r\nseems to have depended more on the internal heat of the earth, only\r\npartially cooled down from its original state, than on the earth's\r\nconfiguration or the influence of the sun. Hence a widely spread\r\nequality of climate--a greenhouse equalization of heat, if I may\r\nso speak; and hence, too, it would seem, a widely spread Fauna and\r\nFlora. The greenhouses of Scotland and Sweden produce the same plants\r\nwith the greenhouses of Spain and Italy; and when the world was one\r\nvast greenhouse, heated from below, the same families of plants,\r\nand the same tribes of animals, seem to have ranged over spaces\r\nimmensely more extended than those geographical circles in which,\r\nin the present time, the same plants are found indigenous, and the\r\nsame animals native. The fossil remains of the true Coal Measures\r\nare the same to the westward of the Alleghany Mountains as in New\r\nHolland, India, Southern Africa, the neighborhood of Newcastle, and\r\nthe vicinity of Edinburgh. And I entertain little doubt that, on a\r\nsimilar principle, the still more ancient organisms of the Old Red\r\nSandstone will be found to bear the same character all over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossils of the Upper Old Red Sandstone much more imperfectly\r\npreserved than those of the Lower.--The Causes obvious.--Difference\r\nbetween the two Groups, which first strikes the Observer, a\r\nDifference in Size.--The _Holoptychius_ a characteristic Ichthyolite\r\nof the Formation.--Description of its huge Scales.--Of its Occipital\r\nBones, Fins, Teeth, and General Appearance.--Contemporaries of the\r\n_Holoptychius_.--Sponge-like Bodies.--Plates resembling those of\r\nthe Sturgeon.--Teeth of various Forms, but all evidently the Teeth\r\nof Fishes.--Limestone Band, and its probable Origin.--Fossils of\r\nthe Yellow Sandstone.--The _Pterichthys_ of Dura Den.--Member of\r\na Family peculiarly characteristic of the System.--No intervening\r\nFormation between the Old Red Sandstone and the Coal Measures.--The\r\n_Holoptychius_ contemporary for a time with the _Megalichthys_.--The\r\nColumns of Tubal Cain.\r\n\r\nThe different degrees of entireness in which the geologist finds his\r\norganic remains, depend much less on their age than on the nature\r\nof the rock in which they occur; and as the arenaceous matrices of\r\nthe Upper and Middle Old Red Sandstones have been less favorable\r\nto the preservation of their peculiar fossils than the calcareous\r\nand aluminous matrices of the Lower, we frequently find the older\r\norganisms of the system fresh and unbroken, and the more modern\r\nexisting as mere fragments. A fish thrown into a heap of salt would\r\nbe found entire after the lapse of many years; a fish thrown into\r\na heap of sand would disappear in a mass of putrefaction in a few\r\nweeks; and only the less destructible parts, such as the teeth,\r\nthe harder bones, and perhaps a few of the scales, would survive.\r\nNow, limestone, if I may so speak, is the preserving salt of the\r\ngeological world; and the conservative qualities of the shales and\r\nstratified clays of the Lower Old Red Sandstone are not much inferior\r\nto those of lime itself; while, in the Upper Old Red, we have merely\r\nbeds of consolidated sand, and these, in most instances, rendered\r\nless conservative of organic remains than even the common sand of our\r\nshores, by a mixture of the red oxide of iron. The older fossils,\r\ntherefore, like the mummies of Egypt, can be described well nigh as\r\nminutely as the existences of the present creation; the newer, like\r\nthe comparatively modern remains of our churchyards, exist, except\r\nin a few rare cases, as mere fragments, and demand powers such as\r\nthose of a Cuvier or an Agassiz to restore them to their original\r\ncombinations. But cases, though few and rare, do occur in which,\r\nthrough some favorable accident connected with the death or sepulture\r\nof some individual existence of the period, its remains have been\r\npreserved almost entire; and one such specimen serves to throw light\r\non whole heaps of the broken remains of its contemporaries. The\r\nsingle elephant, preserved in an iceberg beside the Arctic Ocean,\r\nillustrated the peculiarities of the numerous extinct family to which\r\nit belonged, whose bones and huge tusks whiten the wastes of Siberia.\r\nThe human body found in an Irish bog, with the ancient sandals of\r\nthe country still attached to its feet by thongs, and clothed in a\r\ngarment of coarse hair, gave evidence that bore generally on the\r\ndegree of civilization attained by the inhabitants of an entire\r\ndistrict in a remote age. In all such instances, the character\r\nand appearance of the individual bear on those of the tribe. In\r\nattempting to describe the organisms of the Lower Old Red Sandstone,\r\nwhere the fossils lie as thickly in some localities as herrings on\r\nour coasts in the fishing season, I felt as if I had whole tribes\r\nbefore me. In describing the fossils of the Upper Old Red Sandstone,\r\nI shall have to draw mostly from single specimens. But the evidence\r\nmay be equally sound so far as it goes.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the superior and inferior groups of the system\r\nwhich first strikes an observer, is a difference in the size of\r\nthe fossils of which these groups are composed. The characteristic\r\norganisms of the Upper Old Red Sandstone are of much greater bulk\r\nthan those of the Lower, which seem to have been characterized by a\r\nmediocrity of size throughout the entire extent of the formation.\r\nThe largest ichthyolites of the group do not seem to have much\r\nexceeded two feet or two feet and a half in length; its smaller\r\naverage from an inch to three inches. A jaw in the possession of Dr.\r\nTraill--that of an Orkney species of _Platygnathus_, and by much\r\nthe largest in his collection--does not exceed in bulk the jaw of\r\na full-grown coal-fish or cod; his largest _Coccosteus_ must have\r\nbeen a considerably smaller fish than an ordinary-sized turbot; the\r\nlargest ichthyolite found by the writer was a _Diplopterus_, of,\r\nhowever, smaller dimensions than the ichthyolite to which the jaw\r\nin the possession of Dr. Traill must have belonged; the remains of\r\nanother _Diplopterus_ from Gamrie, the most massy yet discovered\r\nin that locality, seem to have composed the upper parts of an\r\nindividual about two feet and a half in length. The fish, in short,\r\nof the lower ocean of the Old Red Sandstone--and I can speak of it\r\nthroughout an area which comprises Orkney and Inverness, Cromarty,\r\nand Gamrie, and which must have included about ten thousand square\r\nmiles--ranged in size between the stickleback and the cod; whereas\r\nsome of the fish of its upper ocean were covered by scales as large\r\nas oyster-shells, and armed with teeth that rivalled in bulk those\r\nof the crocodile. They must have been fish on an immensely larger\r\nscale than those with which the system began. There have been scales\r\nof the _Holoptychius_ found in Clashbennie which measure three inches\r\nin length by two and a half in breadth, and a full eighth part of\r\nan inch in thickness. There occur occipital plates of fishes in\r\nthe same formation in Moray, a full foot in length by half a foot\r\nin breadth. The fragment of a tooth still attached to a piece of\r\nthe jaw, found in the sandstone cliffs that overhang the Findhorn,\r\nmeasures an inch in diameter at the base. A second tooth of the same\r\nformation, of a still larger size, disinterred by Mr. Patrick Duff\r\nfrom out the conglomerates of the _Scat-Craig_, near Elgin, and now\r\nin his possession, measures two inches in length by rather more than\r\nan inch in diameter. (See Plate X., fig. 4.) There occasionally turn\r\nup in the sandstones of Perthshire ichthyodorulites that in bulk\r\nand appearance resemble the teeth of a harrow rounded at the edges\r\nby a few months' wear, and which must have been attached to fins\r\nnot inferior in general bulk to the dorsal fin of an ordinary-sized\r\nporpoise. In short, the remains of a Patagonian burying-ground would\r\nscarcely contrast more strongly with the remains of that battle-field\r\ndescribed by Addison, in which the pygmies were annihilated by the\r\ncranes, than the organisms of the upper formation of the Old Red\r\nSandstone contrast with those of the lower.[AO]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AO: I have permitted this paragraph to remain as originally\r\nwritten, though the comparatively recent discovery of a gigantic\r\n_Holoptychius_ (_?_) in the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Thurso, by Mr.\r\nRobert Dick of that place, (see introductory note,) bears shrewdly\r\nagainst its general line of statement. But it will, at least, serve\r\nto show how large an amount of negative evidence may be dissipated\r\nby a single positive fact, and to inculcate on the geologist the\r\nnecessity of cautious induction. An individual _Holoptychius_ of\r\nThurso must have been at least thrice the size of the _Holoptychius_\r\nof the Upper Old Red formation, as exhibited in the specimen of Mr.\r\nNoble, of St. Madoes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE X._]\r\n\r\nOf this upper formation the most characteristic and most abundant\r\nichthyolite, as has been already said, is the _Holoptychius_. The\r\nlarge scales and plates, and the huge teeth, belong to this genus.\r\nIt was first introduced to the notice of geologists in a paper read\r\nbefore the Wernerian Society in May, 1830, by Professor Fleming, and\r\npublished by him in the February of the following year, in _Cheek's\r\nEdinburgh Journal_. Only detached scales and the fragment of a tooth\r\nhad as yet been found; and these he minutely described as such,\r\nwithout venturing to hazard a conjecture regarding the character or\r\nfamily of the animal to which they had belonged. They were submitted\r\nsome years after to Agassiz, by whom they were referred, though not\r\nwithout considerable hesitation, to the genus _Gyrolepis_; and the\r\ndoubts of both naturalists serve to show how very uncertain a guide\r\nmere analogy proves to even men of the first order, when brought to\r\nbear on organisms of so strange a type as the ichthyolites of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone. At this stage, however, an almost entire specimen\r\nof the creature was discovered in the sandstones of Clashbennie, by\r\nthe Rev. James Noble, of St. Madoes, a gentleman who, by devoting\r\nhis leisure hours to Geology, has extended the knowledge of this\r\nupper formation, and whose name has been attached by Agassiz\r\nto its characteristic fossil, now designated the _Holoptychius\r\nnobilissimus_. His specimen at once decided that the creature had\r\nbeen no _Gyrolepis_, but the representative of a new genus not less\r\nstrangely organized, and quite as unlike the existences of the\r\npresent times as any existence of all the past. So marked are the\r\npeculiarities of the _Holoptychius_, that they strike the commonest\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nThe scales are very characteristic. They are massy elliptical plates,\r\nscarcely less bulky in proportion to their extent of surface than\r\nour smaller copper coin, composed internally of bone, and externally\r\nof enamel, and presenting on the one side a porous structure, and on\r\nthe other, when well preserved, a bright, glossy surface. The upper,\r\nor glossy side, is the more characteristic of the two. I have placed\r\none of them before me. Imagine an elliptical ivory counter, an inch\r\nand a half in length by an inch in breadth, and nearly an eighth part\r\nof an inch in thickness, the larger diameter forming a line which,\r\nif extended, would pass longitudinally from head to tail through the\r\nanimal which the scale covered. On the upper or anterior margin of\r\nthis elliptical counter, imagine a smooth selvedge or border three\r\neighth parts of an inch in breadth. Beneath this border there is an\r\ninner border of detached tubercles, and beneath the tubercles large\r\nundulating furrows, which stretch longitudinally towards the lower\r\nend of the ellipsis. Some of these waved furrows run unbroken and\r\nseparate to the bottom, some merge into their neighboring furrows at\r\nacute angles, some branch out and again unite, like streams which\r\nenclose islands, and some break into chains of detached tubercles.\r\n(See Plate X., fig. 3.) No two scales exactly resemble one another\r\nin the minuter peculiarities of their sculpture, if I may so speak,\r\njust as no two pieces of lake or sea may be roughened after exactly\r\nthe same pattern during a gale; and yet in general appearance\r\nthey are all wonderfully alike. Their _style_ of sculpture is the\r\nsame--a style which has sometimes reminded me of the Runic knots\r\nof our ancient north country obelisks. Such was the scale of the\r\ncreature. The head, which was small, compared with the size of\r\nthe body, was covered with bony plates, roughened after a pattern\r\nsomewhat different from that of the scales, being tubercled rather\r\nthan ridged; but the tubercles present a confluent appearance, just\r\nas chains of hills may be described as confluent, the base of one\r\nhill running into the base of another. The operculum seems to have\r\nbeen covered by one entire plate--a peculiarity observable, as has\r\nbeen remarked, among some of the ichthyolites of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone, such as the _Diplopterus_, _Dipterus_, and _Osteolepis_.\r\nAnd it, too, has its fields of tubercles, and its smooth marginal\r\nselvedge, or border, on which the lower edges of the upper occipital\r\nplates seem to have rested, just as, in the roof of a slated\r\nbuilding, part of the lower tier of slates is overtopped and covered\r\nby the tier above. The scales towards the tail suddenly diminish\r\nat the ventral fins to about one fourth the size of those on the\r\nupper part of the body; the fins themselves are covered at their\r\nbases, which seem to have been thick and fleshy like the base of the\r\npectoral fin in the cod or haddock, with scales still more minute;\r\nand from the scaly base the rays diverge like the radii of a circle,\r\nand terminate in a semicircular outline. The ventrals are placed\r\nnearer the tail, says Agassiz, than in any other ganoid fish. (See\r\nPlate X., fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nBut no such description can communicate an adequate conception\r\nto the reader of the strikingly picturesque appearance of the\r\n_Holoptychius_, as shown in Mr. Noble's splendid specimen. There is\r\na general massiveness about the separate portions of the creature,\r\nthat imparts ideas of the gigantic, independently of its bulk as\r\na whole; just as a building of moderate size, when composed of\r\nvery ponderous stones, has a more imposing effect than much larger\r\nbuildings in which the stones are smaller. The body measures a foot\r\nacross, by two feet and a half in length, exclusive of the tail,\r\nwhich is wanting; but the armor in which it is cased might have\r\nserved a crocodile or alligator of five times the size. It lies on\r\nits back, on a mass of red sandstone; and the scales and plates still\r\nretain their bony color, slightly tinged with red, like the skeleton\r\nof some animal that had lain for years in a bed of ferruginous marl\r\nor clay. The outline of the occipital portion of the specimen forms\r\na low Gothic arch, of an intermediate style between the round Saxon\r\nand the pointed Norman. This arch is filled by two angular, pane-like\r\nplates, separated by a vertical line, that represents, if I may use\r\nthe figure, the-dividing astragal of the window; and the under jaw,\r\nwith its two sweeping arcs, or branches, constitutes the frame. All\r\nof the head which appears is that under portion of it which extends\r\nfrom the upper part of the belly to the snout. The belly itself is\r\nthickly covered by huge carved scales, that, from their massiveness\r\nand regular arrangement, remind one of the flags of an ancient\r\nstone roof. The carving varies, as they descend towards the tail,\r\nbeing more in the ridged style below, and more in the tubercled\r\nstyle above. So fairly does the creature lie on its back, that the\r\nventral fins have fallen equally, one on each side, and, from their\r\nsemicircular form, remind one of the two pouch holes in a lady's\r\napron, with their laced flaps. The entire outline of the fossil is\r\nthat of an elongated ellipsis, or rather spindle, a little drawn\r\nout towards the caudal extremity. The places of all the fins are\r\nnot indicated, but, as shown by other specimens, they seem to have\r\nbeen crowded together towards the lower extremity, like those of the\r\n_Glyptolepis_, an ichthyolite which, in more than one respect, the\r\n_Holoptychius_ must have resembled, and which, from this peculiarity,\r\npresents a brush-like appearance--the head and shoulders representing\r\nthe handle, and the large and thickly clustered fins the spreading\r\nbristles.[AP]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AP: There are now six species of _Holoptychius_\r\nenumerated--_H. Andersoni_, _H. Flemingii_, _H. giganteus_, _H.\r\nMurchisoni_, _H. nobilissimus_, and _H. Omaliusii_.]\r\n\r\nSome of the occipital bones of the _Holoptychius_ are very curious\r\nand very puzzling. There are pieces rounded at one of the ends,\r\nsomewhat in the manner of the neck joints of our better known\r\nquadrupeds, and which have been mistaken for vertebræ; but which\r\npresent evidently, at the apparent joint, the enamel peculiar to\r\nthe outer surface of all the plates and scales of the creature,\r\nand which belonged, it is probable, to the snout. There are\r\nsaddle-shaped bones, too, which have been regarded as the central\r\noccipital plates of a new species of _Coccosteus_, but whose style\r\nof confluent tubercle belongs evidently to the _Holoptychius_. The\r\njaws are exceedingly curious. They are composed of as solid bone\r\nas we usually find in the jaws of mammalia; and the outer surface,\r\nwhich is covered in animals of commoner structure with portions\r\nof the facial integuments, we find polished and japanned, and\r\nfretted into tubercles. The jaws of the creature, like those of the\r\n_Osteolepis_ of the lower formation, were naked jaws; it is, indeed,\r\nmore than probable that all its real bones were so, and that the\r\ninternal skeleton was cartilaginous. A row of thickly-set, pointed\r\nteeth ran along the japanned edges of the mouth--what, in fish of\r\nthe ordinary construction, would be the lips; and inside this row\r\nthere was a second and widely-set row of at least twenty times the\r\nbulk of the other, and which stood up over and beyond it, like\r\nspires in a city over the rows of lower buildings in front. A nearly\r\nsimilar disposition of teeth seems also to have characterized the\r\n_Holoptychius_ of the Coal Measures, but the contrast in size was\r\nsomewhat less marked. One of the most singularly-formed bones of\r\nthe formation will be found, I doubt not, when perfect specimens of\r\nthe upper part of the creature shall be procured, to have belonged\r\nto the _Holoptychius_. It is a huge ichthyodorulite, formed,\r\nbox-like, of four nearly rectangular planes, terminating in a point,\r\nand ornamented on two of the sides by what, in a work of art, the\r\nreader would at once term a species of Chinese fretwork. Along the\r\ncentre there runs a line of lozenges, slightly truncated where they\r\nunite, just as, in plants that exhibit the cellular texture, the\r\nlozenge-shaped cells may be said to be truncated. At the sides of\r\nthe central line, there run lines of half lozenges, which occupy\r\nthe space to the edges. Each lozenge is marked by lines parallel to\r\nthe lines which describe it, somewhat in the manner of the plates\r\nof the tortoise. The centre of each is thickly tubercled; and what\r\nseems to have been the anterior plane of the ichthyodorulite is\r\nthickly tubercled also, both in the style of the occipital plates and\r\njaws of the _Holoptychius_. This curious bone, which seems to have\r\nbeen either hollow inside, or, what is more probable, filled with\r\ncartilage, measures, in some of the larger specimens, an inch and a\r\nhalf across at the base on its broader planes, and rather more than\r\nhalf an inch on its two narrower ones.[AQ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AQ: This bone has been since assigned by Agassiz to a new\r\ngenus, of which no other fragments have yet been found, but which has\r\nbeen named provisionally _Placothorax paradoxus_.]\r\n\r\nGeologists have still a great deal to learn regarding the\r\ncontemporaries of the _Holoptychius nobilissimus_. The lower portion\r\nof that upper formation to which it more especially belongs--the\r\nportion represented in our second pyramid by the conglomerate and\r\nsandstone bar--though unfavorable to the preservation of animal\r\nremains, represents assuredly no barren period. It has been found\r\nto contain bodies apparently organic, that vary in shape like the\r\nsponges of our existing seas, which in general appearance they\r\nsomewhat resemble, but whose class, and even kingdom, are yet to\r\nfix.[AR]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AR: These organisms, if in reality such, are at once very\r\ncurious and very puzzling. They occur in some localities in great\r\nabundance. A piece of Clashbennie flagstone, somewhat more than two\r\nfeet in length, by fifteen inches in breadth, kindly sent me for\r\nexamination by the Rev. Mr. Noble, of St. Madoes, bears no fewer than\r\ntwelve of them on its upper surface, and presents the appearance\r\nof a piece of rude sculpture, not very unlike those we sometimes\r\nsee in country churchyards, on the tombstones of the times of the\r\nRevolution. All the twelve vary in appearance. Some of them are of a\r\npear shape--some are irregularly oval--some resemble short cuts of\r\nthe bole of a tree--some are spread out like ancient manuscripts,\r\npartially unrolled--one of the number seems a huge, though not over\r\nneatly formed acorn, an apprentice mason's first attempt--the others\r\nare of a shape so irregular as to set comparison and description at\r\ndefiance. They almost all agree, however, when cut transversely, in\r\npresenting flat, elliptical arcs as their sectional lines--in having\r\nan upper surface comparatively smooth, and an under surface nearly\r\nparallel to it, thickly corrugated--and in being all coated with a\r\ngreasy, shining clay, of a deeper red than the surrounding stone. I\r\nwas perhaps rather more confident of their organic character after I\r\nhad examined a few merely detached specimens, than now that I have\r\nseen a dozen of them together. It seems at least a circumstance\r\nto awaken doubt, that though they occur in various positions on\r\nthe slab--some extending across it, some lying diagonally, some\r\nrunning lengthwise--the corrugations of their under surfaces should\r\nrun lengthwise in all--furrowing them in every possible angle, and\r\ngiving evidence, not apparently to the influences of an organic law,\r\ninternal to each, but of the operation of some external cause, acting\r\non the whole in one direction.]\r\n\r\nIt contains, besides, in considerable abundance, though in a state\r\nof very imperfect preservation, scales that differ from those of\r\nthe _Holoptychius_, and from one another. One of these, figured\r\nand described by Professor Fleming in _Cheek's Edinburgh Journal_,\r\nbearing on its upper surface a mark like a St. Andrew's cross,\r\nsurrounded by tubercled dottings, and closely resembling in external\r\nappearance some of the scales of the common sturgeon, \"may be\r\nreferred with some probability,\" says the Professor, \"to an extinct\r\nspecies of the genus _Accipenser_.\"[AS]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AS: May I crave the attention of the reader to a brief\r\nstatement of fact? I have said that Professor Fleming, when he\r\nminutely described the scales of the _Holoptychius_, hazarded no\r\nconjecture regarding the generic character of the creature to which\r\nthey had belonged; he merely introduced them to the notice of the\r\npublic as the scales of some \"vertebrated animal, probably those of\r\na fish.\" I now state that he described the scales of a contemporary\r\nichthyolite as bearing, in external appearance, a \"close resemblance\r\nto some of the scales of the common sturgeon.\" It has been asserted,\r\nthat it was the scales of the _Holoptychius_ which he thus described,\r\n\"referring them to an extinct species of the genus _Accipenser_;\"\r\nand the assertion has been extensively credited, and by some of our\r\nhighest geological authorities. Agassiz himself, evidently in the\r\nbelief that the professor had fallen into a palpable error, deems\r\nit necessary to prove that the _Holoptychius_ could have borne \"no\r\nrelation to the _Accipenser_ or sturgeon.\" Mr. Murchison, in his\r\n_Silurian System_, refers also to the supposed mistake. The person\r\nwith whom the misunderstanding seems to have originated is the Rev.\r\nDr. Anderson, of Newburgh. About a twelvemonth after the discovery\r\nof Professor Fleming in the sandstones of Drumdryan, a similar\r\ndiscovery was made in the sandstones of Clashbennie by a geologist\r\nof Perth, who, on submitting his new found scales to Dr. Anderson,\r\nconcluded, with the Doctor, that they could be no other than oyster\r\nshells; though eventually, on becoming acquainted with the decision\r\nof Professor Fleming regarding them, both gentlemen were content to\r\nalter their opinion, and to regard them as scales. The Professor, in\r\nhis paper on the Old Red Sandstone in _Cheek's Journal_, referred\r\nincidentally to the _oyster shells_ of Clashbennie--a somewhat\r\ndelicate subject of allusion; and in Dr. Anderson's paper on the\r\nsame formation, which appeared about seven years after, in the New\r\nJournal of Professor Jameson, the geological world was told, for\r\nthe first time, that Professor Fleming had described a scale of\r\nClashbennie _similar to those of Drumdryan_, (_i. e._, those of\r\nthe _Holoptychius_,) as bearing a \"close resemblance to some of\r\nthe scales on the common sturgeon,\" and as probably referable to\r\nsome \"extinct species of the genus _Accipenser_.\" Now, Professor\r\nFleming, instead of stating that the scales were at all similar, had\r\nstated very pointedly that they were entirely different; and not\r\nonly had he described them as different, but he had also _figured_\r\nthem as different, and had placed the figures side by side, that the\r\ndifference might be the better seen. To the paper of the Professor,\r\nwhich contained this statement, and to which these figures were\r\nattached, Dr. Anderson referred, as \"read before the Wernerian\r\nSociety;\"--he quoted from it in the Professor's words--he drew some\r\nof the more important facts of his own paper from it--in his late\r\nEssay on the Geology of Fife he has availed himself of it still more\r\nlargely, though with no acknowledgment; it has constituted, in short,\r\nby far the most valuable of all his discoveries in connection with\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone, and apparently the most minutely examined;\r\nand yet, so completely did he fail to detect Professor Fleming's\r\ncarefully drawn distinction between the scales of the _Holoptychius_\r\nand those of its contemporary, that when Agassiz, misled apparently\r\nby the Doctor's own statement, had set himself to show that the scaly\r\ngiant of the formation could have been no sturgeon, the Doctor had\r\nthe passage in which the naturalist established the fact transferred\r\ninto a Fife newspaper, with, of course, the laudable intention of\r\npreventing the Fife public from falling into the _absurd mistake_ of\r\nProfessor Fleming. There seems to be something rather inexplicable\r\nin all this; but there can be little doubt Dr. Anderson could\r\nsatisfactorily explain the whole matter without once referring to\r\nthe _oyster shells_ of Clashbennie. It is improbable that he could\r\nhave wished or intended to injure the reputation of a gentleman\r\nto whose freely-imparted instructions he is indebted for much the\r\ngreater portion of his geological skill--whose remarks, written and\r\nspoken, he has so extensively appropriated in his several papers and\r\nessays--and whose character is known far beyond the limits of his\r\ncountry, for untiring research, philosophic discrimination, and all\r\nthe qualities which constitute a naturalist of the highest order.\r\nDr. Johnston, of Berwick, in his _History of British Zoöphytes_,\r\n(a work of an eminently scientific character,) justly \"ascribes to\r\nthe labors and writings\" of Professor Fleming \"no small share in\r\ndiffusing that taste for Natural History which is now abroad.\" And\r\nas an interesting corroboration of the fact, I may state, that Dr.\r\nMalcolmson, of Madras, lately found an elegant Italian translation of\r\n_Fleming's Philosophy of Zoölogy_, high in repute among the elite of\r\nRome. Lest it should be supposed I do Dr. Anderson injustice in these\r\nremarks, I subjoin the grounds of them in the following extracts from\r\nprofessor Fleming's paper in _Cheek's Journal_, and from the paper in\r\n_Jameson's New Edinburgh Journal_, in which the Doctor purports to\r\ngive a digest of the former, without once referring, however, to the\r\nperiodical in which it is to be found:--\r\n\r\n\"In the summer of 1827,\" says Dr. Fleming, \"I obtained from Drumdryan\r\nquarry, to the south of Cupar, situate in the higher strata of yellow\r\nsandstone, certain organisms, which I readily referred to the scales\r\nof vertebrated animals, probably those of a fish. The largest (see\r\nPlate II., fig. 1, '_figure of a scale of the Holoptychius_') was\r\none inch and one tenth in length, about one inch and two tenths in\r\nbreadth, and not exceeding the fiftieth of an inch in thickness. The\r\npart which, when in its natural position, had been imbedded in the\r\ncuticle, is comparatively smooth, exhibiting, however, in a very\r\ndistinct manner, the semicircularly parallel layers of growth with\r\nobsolete diverging striæ, giving to the surface, when under a lens,\r\na reticulated aspect. The part naturally exposed is marked with\r\nlongitudinal, waved, rounded, anastomosing ridges, which are smooth\r\nand glossy. The whole of the inside of the scale is smooth, though\r\nexhibiting with tolerable distinctness the layers of growth. The form\r\nand structure of the object indicated plainly enough that it had been\r\na scale, a conclusion confirmed by the detection of the phosphate of\r\nlime in its composition. At this period I inserted a short notice of\r\nthe occurrence of these scales in our provincial newspaper, the _Fife\r\nHerald_, for the purpose of attracting the attention of the workmen\r\nand others in the neighborhood, in order to secure the preservation\r\nof any other specimens which might occur.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly a year after these scales had been discovered, not only\r\nin the upper, but even in some of the lower beds of the Yellow\r\nSandstone, I was informed that _oyster shells_ had been found in\r\na quarry in the Old Red Sandstone at Clashbennie, near Errol, in\r\nPerthshire, and that specimens were in the possession of a gentleman\r\nin Perth. Interested in the intelligence, I lost no time in visiting\r\nPerth, and was gratified to find that the supposed oyster shells\r\nwere, in fact, similar to those which I had ascertained to occur in\r\na higher part of the series. The scales were, however, of a larger\r\nsize, some of them exceeding three inches in length, and one eighth\r\nof an inch in thickness. Upon my visit to the quarry, I found the\r\nscales, as in the Yellow Sandstone, most abundant in those parts\r\nof the rock which exhibited a brecciated aspect. Many patches a\r\nfoot in length, full of scales, have occurred; but as yet no entire\r\nimpression of a fish has been obtained.\r\n\r\n\"Another scale, differing from those already noticed, (see Plate II.,\r\nfig. 3, '_figure of an oblong tubercle plate traversed diagonally\r\nby lines, which, bisecting one another a little above the centre,\r\nresembles a St. Andrew's cross, and marked on the edges by faintly\r\nradiating lines_,') is about an inch and a quarter in length, and\r\nan inch in breadth. In external appearance it bears a very close\r\nresemblance to some of the scales on the common sturgeon, and may,\r\nwith some probability, be referred to an extinct species of the genus\r\n_Accipenser_.\"--(_Cheek's Edinburgh Journal_, Feb. 1831, p. 85.)\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Fleming, in 1830,\" says Dr. Anderson, \"read before the Wernerian\r\nSociety a notice 'on the occurrence of scales of vertebrated animals\r\nin the Old Red Sandstone of Fifeshire.' These organisms, as described\r\nby him, occurred in the Yellow Sandstone of Drumdryan and the Gray\r\nSandstone of Parkhill. From the former locality scales of a fish\r\nwere obtained.... The same paper (Professor Fleming's) contains a\r\nnotice of similar scales in the Old Red Sandstone of Clashbennie,\r\nnear Errol, in Perthshire, one of which is described as bearing 'a\r\nvery close resemblance to some of the scales on the common sturgeon,\r\nand may with some probability be referred to an extinct species of\r\nthe genus _Accipenser_.'\"--(_Professor Jameson's Edin. New Phil.\r\nJournal_, Oct. 1837, p. 138.)]\r\n\r\nThe deposit, too, abounds in teeth, various enough in their forms to\r\nindicate a corresponding variety of families and genera among the\r\nichthyolites to which they belonged. Some are nearly straight, like\r\nthose of the _Holoptychius_ of the Coal Measures; some are bent, like\r\nthe beak of a hawk or eagle, into a hook-form; some incline first in\r\none direction, and then in the opposite one, like nails that have\r\nbeen drawn out of a board by the carpenter at two several wrenches,\r\nand bent in opposite angles at each wrench; some are bulky and squat,\r\nsome long and slender; and in almost all the varieties, whether\r\ncurved or straight, squat or slim, the base is elegantly striated\r\nlike the flutings of the column. In the splendid specimen found in\r\nthe sandstones of the Findhorn, the tooth is still attached to a\r\nportion of the jaw, and shows, from the nature of the attachment,\r\nthat the creature to which it belonged must have been a true fish,\r\nnot a reptile. The same peculiarity is observable in two other very\r\nfine specimens in the collection of Mr. Patrick Duff, of Elgin. Both\r\nin saurians and in toothed cetaceæ, such as the porpoise, the teeth\r\nare inserted in sockets. In the ichthyolites of this formation, so\r\nfar as these are illustrated by its better specimens, the teeth, as\r\nin existing fish, are merely placed flat upon the jaw, or in shallow\r\npits, which seem almost to indicate that the contrivance of sockets\r\nmight be afterwards resorted to. Immediately over the sandstone and\r\nconglomerate belt in which these organisms occur, there rests, as has\r\nbeen said, a band of limestone, and over the limestone a thick bed\r\nof yellow sandstone, in which the system terminates, and which is\r\noverlaid in turn by the lower beds of the carboniferous group.\r\n\r\nThe limestone band is unfossiliferous, and resembling, in\r\nmineralogical character, the Cornstones of England and Wales, it\r\nhas been described as the Cornstone of Scotland; but the fact\r\nmerely furnishes one illustration of many, of the inadequacy of a\r\nmineralogical nomenclature for the purposes of the geologist. In\r\nthe neighborhood of Cromarty the lower formation abounds in beds of\r\nnodular limestone, identical in appearance with the Cornstone;--in\r\nEngland similar beds occur so abundantly in the middle formation,\r\nthat it derives its name from them;--in Fife they occur in the upper\r\nformation exclusively. Thus the formation of the _Coccosteus_ and\r\n_Dipterus_ is a cornstone formation in the first locality; that of\r\nthe _Cephalaspis_ and the gigantic lobster in the second; that of\r\nthe _Holoptychius nobilissimus_ in the third. We have but to vary\r\nour field of observation to find all the formations of the system\r\n_Cornstone formations_ in turn. The limestone band of the upper\r\nmember presents exactly similar appearances in Moray as in Fife. It\r\nis in both of a yellowish green or gray color, and a concretionary\r\nstructure, consisting of softer and harder portions, that yield\r\nso unequally to the weather, as to exhibit in exposed cliffs and\r\nboulders a brecciated aspect, as if it had been a mechanical, not\r\na chemical deposit; though its origin must unquestionably have\r\nbeen chemical. It contains minute crystals of galena, and abounds\r\nin masses of a cherty, siliceous substance that strikes fire with\r\nsteel, and which, from the manner in which they are incorporated\r\nwith the rock, show that they must have been formed along with it.\r\nFrom this circumstance, and from the general resemblance it bears\r\nto the deposits of the thermal waters of volcanic districts which\r\nprecipitate siliceous mixed with calcareous matter, it has been\r\nsuggested, and by no mean authority, that it must have derived its\r\norigin from hot springs. The bed is several yards in thickness; and\r\nas it appears both in Moray and in Fife, in localities at least a\r\nhundred and twenty miles apart, it must have been formed, if formed\r\nat all, in this manner, at a period when the volcanic agencies were\r\nin a state of activity at no great distance from the surface.\r\n\r\nThe upper belt of yellow stone, the terminal layer of the pyramid,\r\nis fossiliferous both in Moray and Fife--more richly so in the\r\nlatter county than even the conglomerate belt that underlies it,\r\nand its organisms are better preserved. It was in this upper layer,\r\nin Drumdryan quarry, to the south of Cupar, that Professor Fleming\r\nfound the first-discovered scales of the _Holoptychius_. At Dura\r\nDen, in the same neighborhood, a singularly rich deposit of animal\r\nremains was laid open a few years ago, by some workmen, when employed\r\nin excavating a water-course for a mill. The organisms lay crowded\r\ntogether, a single slab containing no fewer than thirty specimens,\r\nand all in a singularly perfect state of preservation. The whole\r\nspace excavated did not exceed forty square yards in extent, and\r\nyet in these forty yards there were found several genera of fishes\r\nnew to Geology, and not yet figured nor described--a conclusive\r\nproof in itself that we have still very much to learn regarding the\r\nfossils of the Old Red Sandstone. By much the greater portion of the\r\nremains disinterred on this occasion were preserved by a lady in\r\nthe neighborhood; and the news of the discovery spreading over the\r\ndistrict, the Rev. Dr. Anderson, of Newburgh, was fortunately led\r\nto discover them anew in her possession. The most abundant organism\r\nof the group was a variety of _Pterichthys_--the sixth species of\r\nthis very curious genus now discovered in the Old Red Sandstones of\r\nScotland; and as the Doctor had been lucky enough to find out for\r\nhimself, some years before, that the scales of the _Holoptychius_\r\nwere oyster shells, he now ascertained, with quite as little\r\nassistance from without, that the _Pterichthys_ must have been surely\r\na huge beetle. As a beetle, therefore, he figured and described it in\r\nthe pages of a Glasgow topographical publication--_Fife Illustrated_.\r\nTrue, the characteristic elytra were wanting, and some six or seven\r\ntubercle plates substituted in their room; nor could the artist,\r\nwith all his skill, supply the creature with more than two legs; but\r\ningenuity did much for it, notwithstanding; and by lengthening the\r\nsnout, insect-like, into a point--by projecting an eye, insect-like,\r\non what had mysteriously grown into a head--by rounding the body,\r\ninsect-like, until it exactly resembled that of the large \"twilight\r\nshard\"--by exaggerating the tubercles seen in profile on the paddles\r\nuntil they stretched out, insect-like, into bristles--and by\r\ncarefully sinking the tail, which was not insect-like, and for which\r\nno possible use could be discovered at the time--the Doctor succeeded\r\nin making the _Pterichthys_ of Dura Den a very respectable beetle\r\nindeed. In a later publication, an Essay on the Geology of Fifeshire,\r\nwhich appeared in September last in the _Quarterly Journal of\r\nAgriculture_, he states, after referring to his former description,\r\nthat among the higher geological authorities some were disposed to\r\nregard the creature as an extinct crustaceous animal, and some as\r\nbelonging to a tribe closely allied to the _Chelonia_. Agassiz, as\r\nthe writer of these chapters ventured some months ago to predict,\r\nhas since pronounced it a fish--a _Pterichthys_ specifically\r\ndifferent from the five varieties of this ichthyolite which occur in\r\nthe lower formation of the system, but generically the same. I very\r\nlately enjoyed the pleasure of examining the _bona fide_ ichthyolite\r\nitself--one of the specimens of Dura Den, and apparently one of the\r\nmore entire--in the collection of Professor Fleming. Its character as\r\na _Pterichthys_ I found very obvious; but neither the Professor nor\r\nmyself was ingenious enough to discover in it any trace of the beetle\r\nof Dr. Anderson.[AT]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AT: This interesting ichthyolite has since been regarded\r\nby Agassiz as the representative of a distinct genus, to which he\r\ngives the name _Pamphractus_. As exhibited in his restoration,\r\nhowever, it seems to differ little, if at all, (if I may venture\r\nthe suggestion,) from a Pterichthys viewed on the upper side. In\r\nAgassiz's beautiful restoration of Pterichthys, and his accompanying\r\nprints of the fossils illustrative of that genus, it is, with but one\r\ndoubtful exception, the under side of the animal that is presented;\r\nand hence a striking difference apparent between his representations\r\nof the two genera, which would scarce obtain had the upper, not the\r\nunder side of _Pterichthys_ been exhibited. In verification of this\r\nremark, let the reader who has access to the _Monographic Poissons\r\nFossiles_ compare the restoration of _Pamphractus_ (Old Red, Tab.\r\nVI., fig. 2) with the upper side of _Pterichthys_, as figured in this\r\nvolume, Plate I., fig. 1, making, of course, the due allowance for a\r\ndifference of species.]\r\n\r\nIs it not interesting to find this very curious genus in both\r\nthe lowest and highest fossiliferous beds of the system, and\r\nconstituting, like the _Trilobite_ genus of the Silurian group, its\r\nmost characteristic organism? The _Trilobite_ has a wide geological\r\nrange, extending from the upper Cambrian rocks to the upper Coal\r\nMeasures. But though the range of the genus is wide, that of every\r\nindividual species of which it consists is very limited. The\r\n_Trilobites_ of the upper Coal Measures differ from those of the\r\nMountain Limestone; these again, with but one exception, from the\r\n_Trilobites_ of the upper Silurian strata; these yet again from\r\nthe _Trilobites_ of the underlying middle beds; and these from the\r\n_Trilobites_ that occur in the base of the system. Like the coins and\r\nmedals of the antiquary, each represents its own limited period; and\r\nthe whole taken together yield a consecutive record. But while we\r\nfind them merely scattered over the later formations in which they\r\noccur, and that very sparingly, in the Silurian System we find them\r\ncongregated in such vast crowds, that their remains enter largely\r\ninto the composition of many of the rocks which compose it. The\r\n_Trilobite_ is the distinguishing organism of the group, marrying,\r\nif I may so express myself, its upper and lower beds; and what the\r\n_Trilobite_ is to the Silurian formations, the _Pterichthys_ seems to\r\nbe to the formations of the Old Red Sandstone; with this difference,\r\nthat, so far as is yet known, it is restricted to this system alone,\r\noccurring in neither the Silurian System below, nor in the Coal\r\nMeasures above.\r\n\r\nI am but imperfectly acquainted with the localities in which the\r\nupper beds of the Old Red Sandstone underlie the lower beds of the\r\nCoal Measures, or where any gradation of character appears. The\r\nupper yellow sandstone belt is extensively developed in Moray, but\r\nit contains no trace of carbonaceous matter in even its higher\r\nstrata, and no other remains than those of the _Holoptychius_ and\r\nits contemporaries. The system in the north of Scotland differs\r\nas much from the carboniferous group in its upper as in its lower\r\nrocks; and a similar difference has been remarked in Fife, where the\r\ngroups appear in contact a few miles to the west of St. Andrew's.\r\nIn England, in repeated instances, the junction, as shown by Mr.\r\nMurchison, in singularly instructive sections, is well marked, the\r\ncarboniferous limestones resting conformably on the Upper Old Red\r\nSandstone. No other system interposed between them.\r\n\r\nThere is a Rabbinical tradition that the sons of Tubal-Cain, taught\r\nby a prophet of the coming deluge, and unwilling that their father's\r\narts should be lost in it to posterity, erected two obelisks of\r\nbrass, on which they inscribed a record of his discoveries, and\r\nthat thus the learning of the family survived the cataclysm. The\r\nflood subsided, and the obelisks, sculptured from pinnacle to base,\r\nwere found fast fixed in the rock. Now, the twin pyramids of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone, with their party-colored bars, and their thickly\r\ncrowded inscriptions, belong to a period immensely more remote than\r\nthat of the columns of the antediluvians, and they bear a more\r\ncertain record. I have, perhaps, dwelt too long on their various\r\ncompartments; but the Artist by whom they have been erected, and who\r\nhas preserved in them so wonderful a chronicle of his earlier works,\r\nhas willed surely that they should be read, and I have perused but\r\na small portion of the whole. Years must pass ere the entire record\r\ncan be deciphered; but, of all its curiously inscribed sentences, the\r\nresult will prove the same--they will all be found to testify of the\r\nInfinite Mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeculations in the Old Red Sandstone, and their Character.--George,\r\nfirst Earl of Cromarty.--His Sagacity as a Naturalist at fault in\r\none Instance.--Sets himself to dig for Coal in the Lower Old lied\r\nSandstone.--Discovers a fine Artesian Well.--Value of Geological\r\nKnowledge in an economic View.--Scarce a Secondary Formation in the\r\nKingdom in which Coal has not been sought for.--Mineral Springs\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone.--Strathpeffer.--Its Peculiarities\r\nwhence derived.--Chalybeate Springs of Easter Ross and the Black\r\nIsle.--Petrifying Springs.--Building-Stone and Lime of the Old Red\r\nSandstone.--Its various Soils.\r\n\r\nThere has been much money lost, and a good deal won, in speculations\r\nconnected with the Old Red Sandstone. The speculations in which money\r\nhas been won have consorted, if I may so speak, with the character\r\nof the system, and those in which money has been lost have not.\r\nInstead, however, of producing a formal chapter on the economic uses\r\nto which its various deposits have been applied, or the unfortunate\r\nundertakings which an acquaintance with its geology would have\r\nprevented, I shall throw together, as they occur to me, a few simple\r\nfacts illustrative of both.\r\n\r\nGeorge, first Earl of Cromarty, seems, like his namesake and\r\ncontemporary, the too celebrated Sir George M'Kenzie, of Roseavoch,\r\nto have been a man of an eminently active and inquiring mind. He\r\nfound leisure, in the course of a very busy life, to write several\r\nhistorical dissertations of great research, and a very elaborate\r\n_Synopsis Apocalyptica_. He is the author, too, of an exceedingly\r\ncurious letter on the \"Second Sight,\" addressed to the philosophic\r\nBoyle, which contains a large amount of amusing and extraordinary\r\nfact; and his description of the formation of a peat-moss in the\r\ncentral Highlands of Ross-shire has been quoted by almost every\r\nnaturalist who, since the days of the sagacious, nobleman, has\r\nwritten on the formation of peat. His life was extended to extreme\r\nold age; and as his literary ardor remained undiminished till the\r\nlast, some of his writings were produced at a period when most other\r\nmen are sunk in the incurious indifferency and languor of old age.\r\nAnd among these later productions are his remarks on peat. He relates\r\nthat, when a very young man, he had marked, in passing on a journey\r\nthrough the central Highlands of Ross-shire, a wood of very ancient\r\ntrees, doddered and moss-grown, and evidently passing into a state of\r\ndeath through the last stages of decay. He had been led by business\r\ninto the same district many years after, when in middle life, and\r\nfound that the wood had entirely disappeared, and that the heathy\r\nhollow which it had covered was now occupied by a green, stagnant\r\nmorass, unvaried in its tame and level extent by either bush or tree.\r\nIn his old age he again visited the locality, and saw the green\r\nsurface roughened with dingy-colored hollows, and several Highlanders\r\nengaged in it in cutting peat in a stratum several feet in depth.\r\nWhat he had once seen an aged forest had now become an extensive\r\npeat-moss.\r\n\r\nSome time towards the close of the seventeenth century he purchased\r\nthe lands of Cromarty, where his turn for minute observation seems\r\nto have anticipated--little, however, to his own profit--some of\r\nthe later geological discoveries. There is a deep, wooded ravine in\r\nthe neighborhood of the town, traversed by a small stream, which\r\nhas laid bare, for the space of about forty yards in the opening\r\nof the hollow, the gray sandstone and stratified clays of the\r\ninferior fish bed. The locality is rather poor in ichthyolites,\r\nthough I have found in it, after minute search, a few scales of the\r\n_Osteolepis_, and on one occasion one of the better marked plates of\r\nthe _Coccosteus_; but in the vegetable impressions peculiar to the\r\nformation it is very abundant. These are invariably carbonaceous,\r\nand are not unfrequently associated with minute patches of bitumen,\r\nwhich, in the harder specimens, present a coal-like appearance; and\r\nthe vegetable impressions and the bitumen seem to have misled the\r\nsagacious nobleman into the belief that coal might be found on his\r\nnew property. He accordingly brought miners from the south, and set\r\nthem to bore for coal in the gorge of the ravine. Though there was\r\nprobably a register kept of the various strata through which they\r\npassed, it must have long since been lost; but from my acquaintance\r\nwith this portion of the formation, as shown in the neighboring\r\nsections, where it lies uplifted against the granitic gneiss of the\r\nSutors, I think I could pretty nearly restore it. They would first\r\nhave had to pass for about thirty feet through the stratified clays\r\nand shales of the ichthyolite bed, with here and there a thin band\r\nof gray sandstone, and here and there a stratum of lime; they would\r\nnext have had to penetrate through from eighty to a hundred feet of\r\ncoarse red and yellow sandstone, the red greatly predominating. They\r\nwould then have entered the great conglomerate, the lowest member of\r\nthe formation; and in time, if they continued to urge their fruitless\r\nlabors, they would arrive at the primary rock, with its belts of\r\ngranite, and its veins and huge masses of hornblende. In short, there\r\nmight be some possibility of their penetrating to the central fire,\r\nbut none whatever of their ever reaching a vein of coal. From a\r\ncurious circumstance, however, they were prevented from ascertaining,\r\nby actual experience, the utter barrenness of the formation.\r\n\r\nDirectly in the gorge of the ravine, where we may see the partially\r\nwooded banks receding as they ascend from the base to the centre,\r\nand then bellying over from the centre to the summit, there is a\r\nfine chalybeate spring, surmounted by a dome of hewn stone. It was\r\ndiscovered by the miners when in quest of the mineral which they did\r\nnot and could not discover, and forms one of the finest specimens of\r\na true Artesian well which I have any where seen. They had bored to\r\na considerable depth, when, on withdrawing the kind of auger used\r\nfor the purpose, a bolt of water, which occupied the whole diameter\r\nof the bore, came rushing after, like the jet of a fountain, and\r\nthe work was prosecuted no further; for, as steam-engines were not\r\nyet invented, no pit could have been wrought with so large a stream\r\nissuing into it; and as the volume was evidently restricted by the\r\nsize of the bore, it was impossible to say how much greater a stream\r\nthe source might have supplied. The spring still continues to flow\r\ntowards the sea, between its double row of cresses, at the rate of\r\nabout a hogshead per minute--a rate considerably diminished, it is\r\nsaid, from its earlier volume, by some obstruction in the bore.\r\nThe waters are not strongly tinctured--a consequence, perhaps, of\r\ntheir great abundance; but we may see every pebble and stock in\r\ntheir course enveloped by a ferruginous coagulum, resembling burnt\r\nsienna, that has probably been disengaged from the dark red sandstone\r\nbelow, which is known to owe its color to the oxide of iron. A Greek\r\npoet would probably have described the incident as the birth of the\r\nNaiad; in the north, however, which, in an earlier age, had also\r\nits Naiads, though, like the fish of the Old Red Sandstone, they\r\nhave long since become extinct, the recollection of it is merely\r\npreserved by tradition, as a curious, though by no means poetical\r\nfact, and by the name of the well, which is still known as the well\r\nof the _coal-heugh_--the old Scotch name for a coal-pit. Calderwood\r\ntells us, in his description of a violent tempest which burst out\r\nimmediately as his persecutor, James VI., breathed his last, that in\r\nScotland the sea rose high upon the land, and that many \"coal-heughs\r\nwere drowned.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no science whose value can be adequately estimated by\r\neconomists and utilitarians of the lower order. Its true quantities\r\ncannot be represented by arithmetical figures or monetary tables;\r\nfor its effects on mind must be as surely taken into account as its\r\noperations on matter, and what it has accomplished for the human\r\nintellect as certainly as what it has done for the comforts of\r\nsociety or the interests of commerce. Who can attach a marketable\r\nvalue to the discoveries of Newton? I need hardly refer to the\r\noften-quoted remark of Johnson; the beauty of the language in\r\nwhich it is couched has rendered patent to all the truth which it\r\nconveys. \"Whatever withdraws us from the power of the senses,\"\r\nsays the moralist--\"whatever makes the past, the distant, or the\r\nfuture, predominate over the present, advances us in the dignity\r\nof thinking beings.\" And Geology, in a peculiar manner, supplies\r\nto the intellect an exercise of this ennobling character. But\r\nit has, also, its cash value. The time and money squandered in\r\nGreat Britain alone in searching for coal in districts where the\r\nwell-informed geologist could have at once pronounced the search\r\nhopeless, would much more than cover the expense at which geological\r\nresearch has been prosecuted throughout the world. There are few\r\ndistricts in Britain occupied by the secondary deposits, in which,\r\nat one time or another, the attempt has not been made. It has been\r\nthe occasion of enormous expenditure in the south of England among\r\nthe newer formations, where the coal, if it at all occurs, (for\r\nwe occasionally meet with wide gaps in the scale,) must be buried\r\nat an unapproachable depth. It led in Scotland--in the northern\r\ncounty of Sutherland--to an unprofitable working for many years of\r\na sulphureous lignite of the inferior Oolite, far above the true\r\nCoal Measures. The attempt I have just been describing was made in\r\na locality as far beneath them. There is the scene of another and\r\nmore modern attempt in the same district, on the shores of the Moray\r\nFrith, in a detached patch of Lias, where a fossilized wood would\r\nno doubt be found in considerable abundance, but no continuous vein\r\neven of lignite. And it is related by Dr. Anderson, of Newburgh,\r\nthat a fruitless and expensive search after coal has lately been\r\ninstituted in the Old Red Sandstone beds which traverse Strathearn\r\nand the Carse of Gowrie, in the belief that they belong not to\r\nthe Old, but to the New Red Sandstone--a formation which has been\r\nsuccessfully perforated in prosecuting a similar search in various\r\nparts of England. All these instances--and there are hundreds\r\nsuch--show the economic importance of the study of fossils. The\r\nOolite has its veins of apparent coal on the coast of Yorkshire,\r\nand its still more amply developed veins--one of them nearly four\r\nfeet in thickness--on the eastern coast of Sutherlandshire; the\r\nLias has its coniferous fossils in great abundance, some of them\r\nconverted into a lignite which can scarce be distinguished from a\r\ntrue coal; and the bituminous masses of the Lower Old Red, and its\r\ncarbonaceous markings, appear identical, to an unpractised eye, with\r\nthe impressions on the carboniferous sandstones, and the bituminous\r\nmasses which they, too, are occasionally found to enclose. Nor does\r\nthe mineralogical character of its middle beds differ in many cases\r\nfrom that of the lower members of the New Red Sandstone. I have seen\r\nthe older rock in the north of Scotland as strongly saliferous as\r\nany of the newer sandstones, of well nigh as bright a brick-red\r\ntint, of as friable and mouldering a texture, and variegated as\r\nthickly with its specks and streaks of green and buff-color. But\r\nin all these instances there are strongly characterized groups of\r\nfossils, which, like the landmarks of the navigator, or the findings\r\nof his quadrant, establish the true place of the formations to\r\nwhich they belong. Like the patches of leather, of scarlet, and of\r\nblue, which mark the line attached to the deep-sea lead, they show\r\nthe various depths at which we arrive. The Earls of Sutherland set\r\nthemselves to establish a coal-work among the chambered univalves\r\nof the Oolite, and a vast abundance of its peculiar bivalves. The\r\ncoal-borers who perforated the Lias near Cromarty passed every day\r\nto and from their work over one of the richest deposits of animal\r\nremains in the kingdom--a deposit full of the most characteristic\r\nfossils; and drove their auger through a thousand belemnites and\r\nammonites of the upper and inferior Lias, and through gryphites and\r\nichthyodorulites innumerable. The sandstones of Strathearn and the\r\nCarse of Gowrie yield their plates and scales of the _Holoptychius_,\r\nthe most abundant fossil of the Upper Old Red; and the shale of the\r\nlittle dell in which the first Earl of Cromarty set his miners to\r\nwork, contains, as I have said, plates of the Coccosteus and scales\r\nof the _Osteolepis_--fossils found only in the Lower Old Red. Nature,\r\nin all these localities, furnished the index, but men lacked the\r\nskill necessary to decipher it.[AU] I may mention that, independently\r\nof their well-marked organisms, there is a simple test through which\r\nthe lignites of the newer formations may be distinguished from the\r\ntrue coal of the carboniferous system. Coal, though ground into an\r\nimpalpable powder, retains its deep black color, and may be used as\r\na black pigment; lignite, on the contrary, when fully levigated,\r\nassumes a reddish, or, rather, umbry hue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AU: There occurs in Mr. Murchison's _Silurian System_ a\r\nsingularly amusing account of one of the most unfortunate of all\r\ncoal-boring enterprises; the unlucky projector, a Welsh farmer,\r\nhaving set himself to dig for coal in the lowest member of the\r\nsystem, at least six formations beneath the only one at which the\r\nobject of his search could have been found. Mr. Murchison thus\r\nrelates the story:--\r\n\r\n\"At Tin-y-coed I found a credulous farmer ruining himself in\r\nexcavating a horizontal gallery in search of coal, an ignorant miner\r\nbeing his engineer. The case may serve as a striking example of the\r\n_coal-boring_ mania in districts which cannot by possibility contain\r\nthat mineral; and a few words concerning it may, therefore, prove\r\na salutary warning to those who speculate for coal in the Silurian\r\nRocks. The farmhouse of Tin-y-coed is situated on the sloping sides\r\nof a hill of trap, which throw off, upon its north-western flank,\r\nthin beds of black grauwacke shale, dipping to the west-north-west at\r\na high angle. The color of the shale, and of the water that flowed\r\ndown its sides, the pyritous veins, and other vulgar symptoms of\r\ncoal-bearing strata, had long convinced the farmer that he possessed\r\na large hidden mass of coal, and, unfortunately, a small fragment\r\nof real anthracite was discovered, which burnt like the best coal.\r\nMiners were sent for, and operations commenced. To sink a shaft was\r\nimpracticable, both from the want of means, and the large volume\r\nof water. A slightly inclined gallery was therefore commenced, the\r\nmouth of which was opened at the bottom of the hill, on the side of\r\nthe little brook which waters the dell. I have already stated that,\r\nin many cases, where the intrusive trap throws off the shale, the\r\nlatter preserves its natural and unaltered condition to within a\r\ncertain distance of the trap; and so it was at Tin-y-coed, for the\r\nlevel proceeded for 155 feet with little or no obstacle. Mounds of\r\nsoft black shale attested the rapid progress of the adventurers, when\r\nsuddenly they came to a 'change of metal.' They were now approaching\r\nthe nucleus of the little ridge; and the rock they encountered was,\r\nas the men informed me, '_as hard as iron_,' viz., of lydianized\r\nschist, precisely analogous to that which is exposed naturally in\r\nravines where all the phenomena are laid bare. The deluded people,\r\nhowever, endeavored to penetrate the hardened mass, but the vast\r\nexpense of blasting it put a stop to the undertaking, not, however,\r\nwithout a thorough conviction on the part of the farmer, that, could\r\nhe but have got through that hard stuff, he would most surely have\r\nbeen well recompensed, for it was just thereabouts that they began\r\nto find '_small veins of coal_.' It has been before shown, that\r\nportions of anthracite are not unfrequent in the altered shale,\r\nwhere it is in contact with the intrusive rock. And the occurrence\r\nof the smallest portion of anthracite is always sufficient to lead\r\nthe Radnorshire farmer to suppose that he is very near 'El Dorado.'\r\nAmid all their failures, I never met with an individual who was\r\nreally disheartened; a frequent exclamation being, 'O, if our squires\r\nwere only men of _spirit_, we should have as fine coal as any in the\r\nworld!'\"--(_Silurian System_, Part I., p. 328.)]\r\n\r\nI have said that the waters of the well of the coal-heugh are\r\nchalybeate--a probable consequence of their infiltration through\r\nthe iron oxides of the superior beds of the formation, and their\r\nsubsequent passage through the deep red strata of the inferior bed.\r\nThere could be very curious chapters written on mineral springs,\r\nin their connection with the formations through which they pass.\r\nSmollett's masterpiece, honest old Matthew Bramble, became thoroughly\r\ndisgusted with the Bath waters on discovering that they filtered\r\nthrough an ancient burying-ground belonging to the Abbey, and that\r\nmuch of their peculiar taste and odor might probably be owing to\r\nthe \"rotten bones and mouldering carcasses\" through which they were\r\nstrained. Some of the springs of the Old Red Sandstone have also the\r\nchurchyard taste, but the bones and carcasses through which they\r\nstrain are much older than those of the Abbey burying-ground at Bath.\r\nThe bitumen of the strongly impregnated rocks and clay-beds of this\r\nformation, like the bitumen of the still more strongly impregnated\r\nlimestones and shales of the Lias, seems to have had rather an animal\r\nthan vegetable origin. The shales of the Eathie Lias burn like turf\r\nsoaked in oil, and yet they hardly contain one per cent, of vegetable\r\nmatter. In a single cubic inch, however, I have counted about eighty\r\nmolluscous organisms, mostly ammonites, and minute striated scallops;\r\nand the mass, when struck with the hammer, still yields the heavy\r\nodor of animal matter in a state of decay. The lower fish-beds of\r\nthe Old Red are, in some localities, scarcely less bituminous.\r\nThe fossil scales and plates, which they enclose, burn at the\r\ncandle; they contain small cavities filled with a strongly scented,\r\nsemi-fluid bitumen, as adhesive as tar, and as inflammable; and for\r\nmany square miles together the bed is composed almost exclusively\r\nof a dark-colored, semi-calcareous, semi-aluminous schist, scarcely\r\nless fetid, from the great quantity of this substance which it\r\ncontains, than the swine-stones of England. Its vegetable remains\r\nbear but a small proportion to its animal organisms; and from huge\r\naccumulations of these last decomposing amid the mud of a still sea,\r\nlittle disturbed by tempests or currents, and then suddenly interred\r\nby some widely spread catastrophe, to ferment and consolidate under\r\nvast beds of sand and conglomerate, the bitumen[AV] seems to have\r\nbeen elaborated. These bituminous schists, largely charged with\r\nsulphuret of iron, run far into the interior, along the flanks\r\nof the gigantic Ben Nevis, and through the exquisitely pastoral\r\nvalley of Strathpeffer. The higher hills which rise over the valley\r\nare formed mostly of the great conglomerate--Knockferril, with its\r\nvitrified fort--the wooded and precipitous ridge over Brahan--and\r\nthe middle eminences of the gigantic mountain on the north; but\r\nthe bottom and the lower slopes of the valley are occupied by the\r\nbituminous and sulphureous schists of the fish-bed, and in these,\r\nlargely impregnated with the peculiar ingredients of the formation,\r\nthe famous medicinal springs of the Strath have their rise. They\r\ncontain, as shown by chemical analysis, the sulphates of soda, of\r\nlime, of magnesia, common salt, and, above all, sulphuretted hydrogen\r\ngas--elements which masses of sea-mud, charged with animal matter,\r\nwould yield as readily to the chemist as the medicinal springs of\r\nStrathpeffer. Is it not a curious reflection, that the commercial\r\ngreatness of Britain, in the present day, should be closely connected\r\nwith the towering and thickly spread forests of arboraceous ferns and\r\ngigantic reeds--vegetables of strange form and uncouth names--which\r\nflourished and decayed on its surface, age after age, during the\r\nvastly extended term of the carboniferous period, ere the mountains\r\nwere yet upheaved, and when there was as yet no man to till the\r\nground? Is it not a reflection equally curious, that the invalids of\r\nthe present summer should be drinking health, amid the recesses of\r\nStrathpeffer, from the still more ancient mineral and animal debris\r\nof the lower ocean of the Old Red Sandstone, strangely elaborated\r\nfor vast but unreckoned periods in the bowels of the earth? The fact\r\nmay remind us of one of the specifics of a now obsolete school of\r\nmedicine, which flourished in this country about two centuries ago,\r\nand which included in its _materia medica_ portions of the human\r\nframe. Among these was the flesh of Egyptian mummies, impregnated\r\nwith the embalming drugs--the dried muscles and sinews of human\r\ncreatures who had walked in the streets of Thebes or of Luxor three\r\nthousand years ago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AV: \"In the slaty schists of Seefeld, in the Tyrol,\"\r\nsay Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison, \"there is such an abundance\r\nof a similar bitumen, that it is largely extracted for medicinal\r\npurposes.\"--(_Geol. Trans. for 1829_, p. 134.)]\r\n\r\nThe commoner mineral springs of the formation, as might be\r\nanticipated, from the very general diffusion of the oxide to which it\r\nowes its color, are chalybeate. There are districts in Easter-Ross\r\nand the Black Isle in which the traveller scarcely sees a runnel by\r\nthe way-side that is not half choked up by its fox-colored coagulum\r\nof oxide. Two of the most strongly impregnated chalybeates with which\r\nI am acquainted gush out of a sandstone bed, a few yards apart,\r\namong the woods of Tarbat House, on the northern shore of the Frith\r\nof Cromarty. They splash among the pebbles with a half-gurgling,\r\nhalf-tinkling sound, in a solitary but not unpleasing recess,\r\ndarkened by alders and willows; and their waters, after uniting in\r\nthe same runnel, form a little, melancholy looking _lochan_, matted\r\nover with weeds, and edged with flags and rushes, and which swarms\r\nin early summer with the young of the frog in its tadpole state, and\r\nin the after months with the black water-beetle and the newt. The\r\ncircumstance is a somewhat curious one, as the presence of iron as an\r\noxide has been held so unfavorable to both animal and vegetable life,\r\nthat the supposed poverty of the Old Red Sandstone in fossil remains\r\nhas been attributed to its almost universal diffusion at the period\r\nthe deposition was taking place. Were the system as poor as has been\r\nalleged, however, it might be questioned, on the strength of a fact\r\nsuch as this, whether the iron militated so much against the living\r\nexistences of the formation, as against the preservation of their\r\nremains when dead.\r\n\r\nSome of the springs which issue from the ichthyolite beds along\r\nthe shores of the Moray Frith are largely charged, not with iron,\r\nlike the well of the coal-heugh, or the springs of Tarbat House,\r\nnor yet with hydrogen and soda, like the spa of Strathpeffer, but\r\nwith carbonate of lime. When employed for domestic purposes, they\r\nchoke up, in a few years, with a stony deposition, the spouts of\r\ntea-kettles. On a similar principle, they plug up their older\r\nchannels, and then burst out in new ones; nor is it uncommon\r\nto find among the cliffs little hollow recesses, long since\r\ndivested of their waters by this process, that are still thickly\r\nsurrounded by coral-like incrustations of moss and lichens, grass\r\nand nettle-stalks, and roofed with marble-like stalactites. I am\r\nacquainted with at least one of these springs of very considerable\r\nvolume, and dedicated of old to an obscure Roman Catholic saint,\r\nwhose name it still bears, (St. Bennet,) which presents phenomena\r\nnot unworthy the attention of the young geologist. It comes gushing\r\nfrom out the ichthyolite bed, where the latter extends, in the\r\nneighborhood of Cromarty, along the shores of the Moray Frith;\r\nand after depositing in a stagnant morass an accumulation of a\r\ngrayish-colored and partially consolidated travertin, escapes by\r\ntwo openings to the shore, where it is absorbed among the sand and\r\ngravel. A storm about three years ago swept the beach several feet\r\nbeneath its ordinary level, and two little moles of conglomerate\r\nand sandstone, the work of the spring, were found to occupy the two\r\nopenings. Each had its fossils--comminuted sea-shells, and stalks\r\nof hardened moss; and in one of the moles I found imbedded a few\r\nof the vertebral joints of a sheep. It was a recent formation on a\r\nsmall scale, bound together by a calcareous cement furnished by the\r\nfish-beds of the inferior Old Red Sandstone, and composed of sand and\r\npebbles, mostly from the granitic gneiss of the neighboring hill, and\r\norganisms, vegetable and animal, from both the land and the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone of Scotland has been extensively employed\r\nfor the purposes of the architect, and its limestones occasionally\r\napplied to those of the agriculturist. As might be anticipated\r\nin reference to a deposit so widely spread, the quality of both\r\nits sandstones and its lime is found to vary exceedingly in even\r\nthe same beds when examined in different localities. Its inferior\r\nconglomerate, for instance, in the neighborhood of Cromarty, weathers\r\nso rapidly, that a fence built of stones furnished by it little more\r\nthan half a century ago, has mouldered in some places into a mere\r\ngrass-covered mound. The same bed in the neighborhood of Inverness is\r\ncomposed of a stone nearly as hard and quite as durable as granite,\r\nand which has been employed in paving the streets of the place--a\r\npurpose which it serves as well as any of the igneous or primary\r\nrocks could have done. At Redcastle, on the northern shore of the\r\nFrith of Beauly, the same conglomerate assumes an intermediate\r\ncharacter, and forms, though coarse, an excellent building stone,\r\nwhich, in some of the older ruins of the district, presents the\r\nmarks of the tool as sharply indented as when under the hands of\r\nthe workman. Some of the sandstone beds of the system are strongly\r\nsaliferous; and these, however coherent they may appear, never resist\r\nthe weather until first divested of their salt. The main ichthyolite\r\nbed on the northern shore of the Moray Frith is overlaid by a thick\r\ndeposit of a finely-tinted yellow sandstone of this character, which,\r\nunlike most sandstones of a mouldering quality, resists the frosts\r\nand storms of winter, and wastes only when the weather becomes warm\r\nand dry. A few days of sunshine affect it more than whole months of\r\nhigh winds and showers. The heat crystallizes at the surface the\r\nsalt which it contains; the crystals, acting as wedges, throw off\r\nminute particles of the stone; and thus, mechanically at least,\r\nthe degrading process is the same as that to which sandstones of a\r\ndifferent but equally inferior quality are exposed during severe\r\nfrosts. In the course of years, however, this sandstone, when\r\nemployed in building, loses its salt; crust after crust is formed\r\non the surface, and either forced off by the crystals underneath,\r\nor washed away by the rains; and then the stone ceases to waste,\r\nand gathers on its weathered inequalities a protecting mantle of\r\nlichens.[AW] The most valuable quarries in the Old Red System of\r\nScotland yet discovered, are the flagstone quarries of Caithness\r\nand Carmylie. The former have been opened in the middle schists of\r\nthe lower, or Tilestone formation of the system; the latter, as I\r\nhave had occasion to remark oftener than once, in the Cornstone,\r\nor middle formation. The quarries of both Carmylie and Caithness\r\nemploy hundreds of workmen, and their flagstones form an article of\r\ncommerce. The best building-stone of the north of Scotland--best both\r\nfor beauty and durability--is a pure Quartzose Sandstone furnished\r\nby the upper beds of the system. These are extensively quarried in\r\nMoray, near the village of Burghead, and exported to all parts of\r\nthe kingdom. The famous obelisk of Forres, so interesting to the\r\nantiquary--which has been described by some writers as formed of a\r\nspecies of stone unknown in the district, and which, according to a\r\npopular tradition, was transported from the Continent--is evidently\r\ncomposed of this Quartzose Sandstone, and must have been dug out of\r\none of the neighboring quarries. And so coherent is its texture, that\r\nthe storms of, perhaps, ten centuries have failed to obliterate its\r\nrude but impressive sculptures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AW: When left to time the process is a tedious one, and,\r\nere its accomplishment, the beauty of the masonry is always in some\r\ndegree destroyed. The following passage, from a popular work, points\r\nout a mode by which it might possibly be anticipated, and the waste\r\nof surface prevented:--\"A hall of which the walls were constantly\r\ndamp, though every means were employed to keep them dry, was about to\r\nbe pulled down, when M. Schmithall recommended, as a last resource,\r\nthat the walls should be washed with sulphuric acid, (vitriol.)\r\nIt w T as done, and the deliquescent salts being decomposed by\r\nacid, the walls dried, and the hall was afterwards free from\r\ndampness.\"--(_Recreations in Science._)]\r\n\r\nThe limestones of both the upper and lower formations of the system\r\nhave been wrought in Moray with tolerable success. In both, however,\r\nthey contain a considerable per centage of siliceous and argillaceous\r\nearth. The system, though occupying an intermediate place between\r\ntwo metalliferous deposits,--the grauwacke and the carboniferous\r\nlimestone,--has not been found to contain workable veins any where\r\nin Britain, and in Scotland no metallic veins of any kind, with the\r\nexception of here and there a few slender threads of ironstone,\r\nand here and there a few detached crystals of galena. Its wealth\r\nconsists exclusively in building and paving stone, and in lime. Some\r\nof the richest tracts of corn land in the kingdom rest on the Old\r\nRed Sandstone--the agricultural valley of Strathmore, for instance,\r\nand the fertile plains of Easter-Ross: Caithness has also its deep,\r\ncorn-bearing soils, and Moray has been well known for centuries as\r\nthe granary of Scotland. But in all these localities the fertility\r\nseems derived rather from an intervening subsoil of tenacious\r\ndiluvial clay, than from the rocks of the system. Wherever the clay\r\nis wanting, the soil is barren. In the moor of the Milbuy,--a tract\r\nabout fifty square miles in extent, and lying within an hour's walk\r\nof the Friths of Cromarty and Beauly,--a thin covering of soil rests\r\non the sandstones of the lower formation. And so extreme is the\r\nbarrenness of this moor, that notwithstanding the advantages of its\r\nsemi-insular situation, it was suffered to lie as an unclaimed common\r\nuntil about twenty-five years ago, when it was parcelled out among\r\nthe neighboring proprietors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeological Physiognomy.--Scenery of the Primary Formations; Gneiss,\r\nMica Schist, Quartz Rock.--Of the Secondary; the Chalk Formations,\r\nthe Oolite, the New Red Sandstone, the Coal Measures.--Scenery in the\r\nNeighborhood of Edinburgh.--Aspect of the Trap Rocks.--The Disturbing\r\nand Denuding Agencies.--Distinctive Features of the Old Red\r\nSandstone.--Of the Great Conglomerate.--Of the Ichthyolite Beds.--The\r\nBurn of Eathie.--The Upper Old Red Sandstones.--Scene in Moray.\r\n\r\nPhysiognomy is no idle or doubtful science in connection with\r\nGeology. The physiognomy of a country indicates, almost invariably,\r\nits geological character. There is scarce a rock among the more\r\nancient groups that does not affect its peculiar form of hill and\r\nvalley. Each has its style of landscape; and as the vegetation of\r\na district depends often on the nature of the underlying deposits,\r\nnot only are the main outlines regulated by the mineralogy of the\r\nformations which they define, but also in many cases the manner in\r\nwhich these outlines are filled up. The coloring of the landscape is\r\nwell nigh as intimately connected with its Geology as the drawing.\r\nThe traveller passes through a mountainous region of gneiss. The\r\nhills, which, though bulky, are shapeless, raise their huge backs\r\nso high over the brown, dreary moors, which, unvaried by precipice\r\nor ravine, stretch away for miles from their feet, that even amid\r\nthe heats of midsummer the snow gleams in streaks and patches\r\nfrom their summits. And yet so vast is their extent of base, and\r\ntheir tops so truncated, that they seem but half-finished hills\r\nnotwithstanding--hills interdicted somehow in the forming, and the\r\nwork stopped ere the upper stories had been added. He pursues his\r\njourney, and enters a district of micaceous schist. The hills are no\r\nlonger truncated, or the t moors unbroken; the heavy ground-swell\r\nof the former landscape has become a tempestuous sea, agitated by\r\npowerful winds and conflicting tides. The picturesque and somewhat\r\nfantastic outline is composed of high, sharp peaks, bold, craggy\r\ndomes, steep, broken acclivities, and deeply serrated ridges; and\r\nthe higher hills seem as if set round with a framework of props and\r\nbuttresses, that stretch out on every side like the roots of an\r\nancient oak. He passes on, and the landscape varies; the surrounding\r\nhills, though lofty, pyramidal, and abrupt, are less rugged than\r\nbefore; and the ravines, though still deep and narrow, are walled by\r\nridges no longer serrated and angular, but comparatively rectilinear\r\nand smooth. But the vegetation is even more scanty than formerly; the\r\nsteeper slopes are covered with streams of debris, on which scarce a\r\nmoss or lichen finds root; and the conoidal hills, bare of soil from\r\ntheir summits half way down, seem so many naked skeletons, that speak\r\nof the decay and death of nature. All is solitude and sterility.\r\nThe territory is one of Quartz rock. Still the traveller passes on:\r\nthe mountains sink into low swellings; long rectilinear ridges run\r\nout towards the distant sea, and terminate in bluff, precipitous\r\nheadlands. The valleys, soft and pastoral, widen into plains, or\r\nincline in long-drawn slopes of gentlest declivity. The streams,\r\nhitherto so headlong and broken, linger beside their banks, and then\r\nwiden into friths and estuaries. The deep soil is covered by a thick\r\nmantle of vegetation--by forest trees of largest growth, and rich\r\nfields of corn; and the solitude of the mountains has given place to\r\na busy population. He has left behind him the primary regions, and\r\nentered on one of the secondary districts.\r\n\r\nAnd these less rugged formations have also their respective\r\nstyles--marred and obliterated often by the Plutonic agency, which\r\nimparts to them in some instances its own character, and in some\r\nan intermediate one, but in general distinctly marked, and easily\r\nrecognized. The Chalk presents its long inland lines of apparent\r\ncoast, that send out their rounded headlands, cape beyond cape,\r\ninto the wooded or corn-covered plains below. Here and there, there\r\njuts up at the base of the escarpement a white, obelisk-like stack;\r\nhere and there, there opens into the interior a narrow, grassy bay,\r\nin which noble beeches have cast anchor. There are valleys without\r\nstreams; and the landscape a-top is a scene of arid and uneven\r\ndowns, that seem to rise and fall like the sea after a storm. We\r\npass on to the Oolite: the slopes are more gentle, the lines of\r\nrising ground less continuous, and less coast-like; the valleys have\r\ntheir rivulets, and the undulating surface is covered by a richer\r\nvegetation. We enter on a district of New Red Sandstone. Deep,\r\nnarrow ravines intersect elevated platforms. There are lines of\r\nlow precipices, so perpendicular and so red, that they seem as if\r\nwalled over with new brick; and here and there, amid the speckled\r\nand mouldering sandstones, that gather no covering of lichen, there\r\nstands up a huge, altar-like mass of lime, mossy and gray, as if it\r\nrepresented a remoter antiquity than the rocks around it. The Coal\r\nMeasures present often the appearance of vast lakes frozen over\r\nduring a high wind, partially broken afterwards by a sudden thaw,\r\nand then frozen again. Their shores stand up around them in the form\r\nof ridges and mountain chains of the older rocks; and their surfaces\r\nare grooved into flat valleys and long lines of elevation. Take, as\r\nan instance, the scenery about Edinburgh. The Ochil Hills and the\r\nGrampians form the distant shores of the seeming lake or basin on\r\nthe one side, the range of the Lammermuirs and the Pentland group on\r\nthe other; the space between is ridged and furrowed in long lines,\r\nthat run in nearly the same direction from north-east to south-west,\r\nas if, when the binding frost w r as first setting in, the wind had\r\nblown from off the northern or southern shore.\r\n\r\nBut whence these abrupt, precipitous hills that stud the landscape,\r\nand form, in the immediate neighborhood of the city, its more\r\nstriking features? They belong--to return to the illustration of the\r\ntwice-frozen lake--to the middle period of thaw, when the ice broke\r\nup; and, as they are composed chiefly of matter ejected from the\r\nabyss, might have characterized equally any of the other formations.\r\nTheir very striking forms, however, illustrate happily the operations\r\nof the great agencies on which, in the secondary and transition\r\ndeposits, all the peculiarities of scenery depend. The molten matter\r\nfrom beneath seems to have been injected, in the first instance,\r\nthrough rents and fissures among the carboniferous shales and\r\nsandstones of the district, where it lay cooling in its subterranean\r\nmatrices, in beds and dikes, like metal in the moulds of the founder;\r\nand the places which if occupied must have been indicated on the\r\nsurface but by curves and swellings of the strata. The denuding\r\npower then came into operation in the form of tides and currents,\r\nand ground down the superincumbent rocks. The injected masses, now\r\ncooled and hardened, were laid bare; and the softer framework of the\r\nmoulds in which they had been cast was washed from their summits and\r\nsides, except where long ridges remained attached to them in the\r\nlines of the current, as if to indicate the direction in which they\r\nhad broken its force. Every larger stone in a water-course, after the\r\ntorrent fed by a thunder shower has just subsided, shows, on the\r\nsame principle, its trail of sand and shingle piled up behind it. The\r\noutlines of the landscape were modified yet further by the yielding\r\ncharacter of the basement of sandstone or shale on which the Plutonic\r\nbeds so often rest. The basement crumbled away as the tides and waves\r\nbroke against it. The injected beds above, undermined in the process,\r\nand with a vertical cleavage, induced by their columnar tendency,\r\nfell down in masses that left a front perpendicular as a wall. Each\r\nbed came thus to present its own upright line of precipice; and\r\nhence--when they rise bed above bed, as often occurs--the stair-like\r\noutline of hill to which the trap rocks owe their name; hence the\r\noutline of the Dalmahoy Crags, for instance, and of the southern and\r\nwestern front of Salisbury Crags.\r\n\r\nIn all the sedimentary formations the peculiarities of scenery depend\r\non three circumstances--on the Plutonic agencies, the denuding\r\nagencies, and the manner and proportions in which the harder and\r\nsofter beds of the deposits on which these operated alternate with\r\none another. There is an union of the active and the passive in the\r\nformation of landscape; that which disturbs and grinds down, and that\r\nwhich, according to its texture and composition, affects, if I may\r\nso speak, a peculiar style of being ground down and disturbed; and\r\nit is in the passive circumstances that the peculiarities chiefly\r\noriginate, Hence it is that the scenery of the Chalk differs from\r\nthe scenery of the Oolite, and both from that of the Coal Measures.\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone has also its peculiarities of prospect, which\r\nvary according to its formations, and the amount and character of the\r\ndisturbing and denuding agencies to which these have been exposed.\r\nInstead, however, of crowding its various, and, in some instances,\r\ndissimilar features into one landscape, I shall introduce to the\r\nreader a few of its more striking and characteristic scenes, as\r\nexhibited in various localities, and by different deposits, beginning\r\nfirst with its conglomerate base.\r\n\r\nThe great antiquity of this deposit is unequivocally indicated\r\nby the manner in which we find it capping, far in the interior,\r\nin insulated beds and patches, some of our loftier hills, or, in\r\nsome instances, wrapping them round, as with a caul, from base\r\nto summit. It mixes largely, in our northern districts, with the\r\nmountain scenery of the country, and imparts strength and boldness\r\nof outline to every landscape in which it occurs. Its island-like\r\npatches affect generally a bluff parabolic or conical outline; its\r\nloftier hills present rounded, dome-like summits, which sink to\r\nthe plain on the one hand in steep, slightly concave lines, and on\r\nthe other in lines decidedly convex, and a little less steep. The\r\nmountain of boldest outline in 'the line of the Caledonian Valley\r\n(Mealforvony) is composed externally of this rock. Except where\r\ncovered by the diluvium, it seems little friendly to vegetation.\r\nIts higher summits are well nigh as bare as those of the primary\r\nrocks; and when a public road crosses its lower ridges, the traveller\r\ngenerally finds that there is no paving process necessary to procure\r\na hardened surface, for his wheels rattle over the pebbles embedded\r\nin the rock. On the sea-coast, in several localities, the deposit\r\npresents striking peculiarities of outline. The bluff and rounded\r\nprecipices stand out in vast masses, that affect the mural form, and\r\npresent few of the minuter angularities of the primary rocks. Here\r\nand there a square buttress of huge proportions leans against the\r\nfront of some low-browed crag, that seems little to need any such\r\nsupport, and casts a length of shadow athwart its face. There opens\r\nalong the base of the rock a line of rounded, shallow caves, or what\r\nseem rather the openings of caves not yet dug, and which testify of\r\na period when the sea stood about thirty feet higher on our coasts\r\nthan at present. A multitude of stacks and tabular masses lie grouped\r\nin front, perforated often by squat, heavy arches; and stacks,\r\ncaverns, buttresses, crags, and arches, are all alike mottled over\r\nby the thickly-set and variously colored pebbles. There is a tract\r\nof scenery of this strangely marked character in the neighborhood of\r\nDunottar, and two other similar tracts in the far north, where the\r\nhill of Nigg, in Ross-shire, declines towards the Lias deposit in the\r\nBay of Shandwick, and where, in the vicinity of Inverness, a line of\r\nbold, precipitous coast runs between the pyramidal wooded eminence\r\nwhich occupies the south-eastern corner of Ross, and the tower-like\r\nheadlands that guard the entrance of the Bay of Munlochy. In the\r\nlatter tract, however, the conglomerate is much less cavernous than\r\nin the other two.\r\n\r\nThe sea-coast of St. Vigeans, in Forfarshire, has been long\r\ncelebrated for its romantic scenery and its caves; and though it\r\nbelongs rather to the conglomerate base of the upper formation than\r\nto the great conglomerate base of the lower, it is marked, from\r\nthe nature of the materials--materials common to both--by features\r\nindistinguishable from those which characterize the sea-coasts of\r\nthe older deposit. Its wall of precipices averages from a hundred to\r\na hundred and eighty feet in height--no very great matter compared\r\nwith some of our northern lines, but the cliffs make up for their\r\nwant of altitude by their bold and picturesque combinations of form;\r\nand I scarce know where a long summer's day could well be passed more\r\nagreeably than among their wild and solitary recesses. The incessant\r\nlashings of the sea have ground them down into shapes the most\r\nfantastic. Huge stacks, that stand up from amid the breakers, are\r\nhere and there perforated by round, heavy-browed arches, and cast\r\nthe morning shadows inland athwart the cavern-hollowed precipices\r\nbehind. The never-ceasing echoes reply, in long and gloomy caves, to\r\nthe wild tones of the sea. Here a bluff promontory projects into the\r\ndeep, green water, and the white foam, in times of tempest, dashes up\r\na hundred feet against its face. There a narrow strip of vegetation,\r\nspangled with wild flowers, intervenes between the beach and the foot\r\nof the cliffs that sweep along the bottom of some semicircular bay;\r\nbut we see, from the rounded caves by which they are studded, and\r\nthe polish which has blunted their lower angularities, that at some\r\nearly period the breakers must have dashed for ages against their\r\nbases. The _Gaylet Pot_, a place of interest, from its very striking\r\nappearance, to more than geologists, is connected with one of the\r\ndeep-sea promontories. We see an oblong hollow in the centre of a\r\ncorn-field, that borders on the cliffs. It deepens as we approach it,\r\nand on reaching the edge we find ourselves standing on the verge of a\r\nprecipice about a hundred and fifty feet in depth, and see the waves\r\ndashing along the bottom. On descending by a somewhat precarious\r\npath, we find that a long, tunnel-like cavern communicates with the\r\nsea, and mark, through the deep gloom of the passage, the sunlight\r\nplaying beyond; and now and then a white sail passing the opening, as\r\nif flitting across the field of a telescope. The _Gaylet Pot_ seems\r\noriginally to have been merely a deep, straight cave, hollowed in\r\nthe line of a fault by the waves; and it owes evidently its present\r\nappearance to the falling in of the roof for about a hundred yards,\r\nat its inner extremity.\r\n\r\nWe pass from the conglomerate to the middle and upper beds of the\r\nlower formation, and find scenery of a different character in the\r\ndistricts in which they prevail. The aspect is less bold and\r\nrugged, and affects often long horizontal lines, that stretch away\r\nwithout rise or depression, amid the surrounding inequalities of the\r\nlandscape for miles and leagues, and that decline to either side,\r\nlike roofs of what the architect would term a low pitch. The ridge\r\nof the Leys in the eastern opening of the Caledonian Valley, so\r\nrectilinear in its outline, and so sloping in its sides, presents a\r\ngood illustration of this peculiarity. The rectilinear ridge which\r\nruns from the Southern Sutor of Cromarty far into the interior of\r\nthe country, and which has been compared in a former chapter to the\r\nshaft of a spear, furnishes another illustration equally apt.[AX]\r\nWhere the sloping sides of these roof-like ridges decline, as in the\r\nlatter instance, towards an exposed sea-coast, we find the slope\r\nterminating often in an abrupt line of rock dug out by the waves.\r\nIt is thus a roof set on walls, and furnished with eaves. A ditch\r\njust finished by the laborer presents regularly sloping sides; but\r\nthe little stream that comes running through gradually widens its\r\nbed by digging furrows into the slopes, the undermined masses fall\r\nin and are swept away, and, in the course of a few months, the sides\r\nare no longer sloping, but abrupt. And such, on a great scale, has\r\nbeen the process through which coast-lines that were originally paved\r\nslopes have become walls of precipices. The waves cut first through\r\nthe outer strata; and every stratum thus divided comes to present two\r\nfaces--a perpendicular face in the newly-formed line of precipice,\r\nand another horizontal face lying parallel to it, along the shore.\r\nOne half the severed stratum seems as if rising out of the sea, the\r\nother half as if descending from the hill: the geologist who walks\r\nalong the beach finds the various beds presented in duplicate--a\r\nhill-bed on the one side, and a sea-bed on the other. There occurs\r\na very interesting instance of this arrangement in the bold line of\r\ncoast on the northern shore of the Moray Frith, so often alluded to\r\nin a previous chapter, as extending between the Southern Sutor and\r\nthe Hill of Eathie; and which forms the wall of a portion of the\r\nroof-like ridge last described. The sea first broke in a long line\r\nthrough strata of red and gray shale, next through a thick bed of\r\npale-yellow stone, then through a continuous bed of stratified clays\r\nand nodular limestone, and, last of all, through a bed, thicker than\r\nany of the others, of indurated red sandstone. The line of cliffs\r\nformed in this way rises abruptly for about a hundred yards on the\r\none hand; the shore stretches out for more than double the same space\r\non the other; on both sides the beds exactly correspond; and to\r\nascend in the line of the strata from the foot of the cliffs, we have\r\neither to climb the hill, or to pass downwards at low ebb to the edge\r\nof the sea. The section is of interest, not only from the numerous\r\norganisms, animal and vegetable, which its ichthyolite beds contain,\r\nbut from the illustration which it also furnishes of denudation\r\nto a vast extent from causes still in active operation. A line of\r\nprecipices a hundred yards in height, and more than two miles in\r\nlength, has been dug out of the slope by the slow wear of the waves,\r\nin the unreckoned course of that period during which the present sea\r\nwas bounded in this locality by the existing line of coast. (See\r\nFrontispiece, sect. 3.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote AX: The valleys which separate these ridges form often\r\nspacious friths and bays, the frequent occurrence of which in\r\nthe Old lied Sandstone constitutes, in some localities, one of\r\nthe characteristics of the system. Mark in a map of the north of\r\nScotland, how closely friths and estuaries lie crowded together\r\nbetween the counties of Sutherland and Inverness. In a line of coast\r\nlittle more than forty miles in extent, there occur four arms of\r\nthe sea--the Friths of Cromarty, Beauly, and Dornoch, and the Bay\r\nof Munlochy. The Frith of Tay and the Basin of Montrose are also\r\nsemi-marine valleys of the Old Red Sandstone. Two of the finest\r\nharbors in Britain, or the world, belong to it--Milford Haven, in\r\nSouth Wales, and the Bay of Cromarty.]\r\n\r\nI know not a more instructive walk for the young geologist than\r\nthat furnished by the two miles of shore along which this section\r\nextends. Years of examination and inquiry would fail to exhaust it.\r\nIt presents us, I have said, with the numerous organisms of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone; it presents us also, towards its western\r\nextremity, with the still more numerous organisms of the Lower and\r\nUpper Lias; nor are the inflections and faults which its strata\r\nexhibit less instructive than its fossils or its vast denuded hollow.\r\nI have climbed along its wall of cliffs during the height of a\r\ntempestuous winter tide, when waves of huge volume, that had begun to\r\ngather strength under the night of the Northern Ocean, were bursting\r\nand foaming below; and as the harder pebbles, uplifted by the surge,\r\nrolled by thousands and tens of thousands along the rocky bottom, and\r\nthe work of denudation went on, I have thought of the remote past,\r\nwhen the same agents had first begun to grind down the upper strata,\r\nwhose broken edges now projected high over my head on the one hand,\r\nand lay buried far under the waves at my feet on the other. Almost\r\nall mountain chains present their abrupter escarpements to the sea,\r\nthough separated from it in many instances by hundreds of miles--a\r\nconsequence, it is probable, of a similar course of denudation, ere\r\nthey had attained their present altitude, or the plains at their\r\nfeet had been elevated over the level of the ocean. Had a rise of a\r\nhundred feet taken place in this northern district in the days of\r\nCæsar, the whole upper part of the Moray Frith would have been laid\r\ndry, and it would now have seemed as inexplicable that this roof-like\r\nridge should present so rugged a line of wall to the distant sea,\r\nas that the Western Ghauts of India should invariably turn their\r\nsteepest declivities to the basin of the Indian Ocean, or that, from\r\nthe Arctic Circle to the southern extremity of Patagonia, the huge\r\nmountain-chain of America should elevate its dizzy precipices in the\r\nline of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLet us take another view of this section. It stretches between two\r\nof the granitic knobs or wedges to which I have had such frequent\r\noccasion to refer--the Southern Sutor of Cromarty, and the Hill\r\nof Eathie; and the edges of the strata somewhat remind one of the\r\nedges of a bundle of deals laid flatways on two stones, and bent\r\ntowards the middle by their own weight. But their more brittle\r\ncharacter is shown by the manner in which their ends are broken and\r\nuptilted against the granitic knobs on which they seem to rest; and\r\ntowards the western knob the whole bundle has been broken across\r\nfrom below, and the opening occasioned by the fracture forms a\r\ndeep, savage ravine, skirted by precipices, that runs far into the\r\ninterior, and exhibits the lower portion of the system to well nigh\r\nits base. Will the reader spend a very few minutes in exploring\r\nthe solitary recesses of this rocky trench--it matters not whether\r\nas a scene-hunter or a geologist? We pass onwards along the beach\r\nthrough the middle line of the denuded hollow. The natural rampart\r\nthat rises on the right ascends towards the uplands in steep slopes,\r\nlined horizontally by sheep-walks, and fretted by mossy knolls,\r\nand churchyard-like ridges--or juts out into abrupt and weathered\r\ncrags, crusted with lichens and festooned with ivy--or recedes into\r\nbosky hollows, roughened by the sloe-thorn, the wild-rose, and the\r\njuniper; on the left the wide extent of the Moray Frith stretches out\r\nto the dim horizon, with its vein-like currents, and its undulating\r\nlines of coast; while before us we see, far in the distance, the\r\nblue vista of the Great Valley, with its double wall of jagged and\r\nserrated hills, and directly in the opening, the gray, diminished\r\nspires of Inverness. We reach a brown, mossy stream, of just volume\r\nenough to sweep away the pebbles and shells that have been strewed\r\nin its course by the last tide; and see, on turning a sudden angle,\r\nthe precipices cleft to their base by the ravine that has yielded its\r\nwaters a passage from the interior.\r\n\r\nWe enter along the bed of the stream. A line of mural precipices\r\nrises on either hand--here advancing in ponderous overhanging\r\nbuttresses, there receding into deep, damp recesses, tapestried with\r\nivy, and darkened with birch and hazel. A powerful spring, charged\r\nwith lime, comes pouring by a hundred different threads over the\r\nrounded brow of a beetling crag, and the decaying vegetation around\r\nit is hardening into stone. The cliffs vary their outline at every\r\nstep, as if assuming in succession, all the various combinations\r\nof form that constitute the wild and the picturesque; and the pale\r\nhues of the stone seem, when brightened by the sun, the very tints\r\na painter would choose to heighten the effect of his shades, or to\r\ncontrast most delicately with the luxuriant profusion of bushes and\r\nflowers that wave over the higher shelves and crannies. A colony of\r\nswallows have built from time immemorial under the overhanging strata\r\nof one of the loftier precipices; the fox and badger harbor in the\r\nclefts of the steeper and more inaccessible banks. As we proceed,\r\nthe deli becomes wilder and more deeply wooded; the stream frets\r\nand toils at our feet--here leaping over an opposing ridge;--there\r\nstruggling in a pool--yonder escaping to the light from under some\r\nbroken fragment of cliff. There is a richer profusion of flowers,\r\na thicker mantling of ivy and honeysuckle; and after passing a\r\nsemicircular inflection of the bank, that waves from base to summit\r\nwith birch, hazel, and hawthorn, we find the passage shut up by a\r\nperpendicular wall of rock about thirty feet in height, over which\r\nthe stream precipitates itself, in a slender column of foam, into a\r\ndark, mossy basin. The long arms of an intermingled clump of birches\r\nand hazels stretch half way across, tripling with their shade the\r\napparent depth of the pool, and heightening in an equal ratio the\r\nwhite flicker of the cascade, and the effect of the bright patches of\r\nfoam which, flung from the rock, incessantly revolve on the eddy.\r\n\r\nMark now the geology of the ravine. For about half way from where\r\nit opens to the shore, to where the path is obstructed by the deep\r\nmossy pool and the cascade, its precipitous sides consist of three\r\nbars or stories. There is first, reckoning from the stream upwards,\r\na broad bar of pale red; then a broad bar of pale lead color; last\r\nand highest, a broad bar of pale yellow; and above all, there rises\r\na steep green slope, that continues its ascent till it gains the top\r\nof the ridge. The middle, lead-colored bar is an ichthyolite bed, a\r\nplace of sepulture among the rocks, where the dead lie by myriads.\r\nThe yellow bar above is a thick bed of saliferous sandstone. We\r\nmay see the projections on which the sun has beat most powerfully\r\ncovered with a white crust of salt; and it may be deemed worthy of\r\nremark, in connection with the circumstance, that its shelves and\r\ncrannies are richer in vegetation than those of the other bars. The\r\npale red bar below is composed of a coarser and harder sandstone,\r\nwhich forms an upper moiety of the arenaceous portion of the great\r\nconglomerate. Now mark, further, that on reaching a midway point\r\nbetween the beach and the cascade, this triple-barred line of\r\nprecipices abruptly terminates, and a line of precipices of coarse\r\nconglomerate as abruptly begins. I occasionally pass a continuous\r\nwall, built at two different periods, and composed of two different\r\nkinds of materials: the one half of it is formed of white sandstone,\r\nthe other half of a dark-colored basalt; and the place where the\r\nsandstone ends and the basalt begins is marked by a vertical line, on\r\nthe one side of which all is dark colored, while all is of a light\r\ncolor on the other. Equally marked and abrupt is the vertical line\r\nwhich separates the triple-barred from the conglomerate cliffs of\r\nthe ravine of Eathie. The ravine itself may be described as a fault\r\nin the strata; but here is a fault, lying at right angles with it,\r\non a much larger scale: the great conglomerate on which the triple\r\nbars rest has been cast up at least two hundred feet, and placed\r\nside by side with them. And yet the surface above bears no trace of\r\nthe catastrophe. Denuding agencies of even greater power than those\r\nwhich have hollowed out the cliffs of the neighboring coast, or whose\r\noperations have been prolonged through periods of even more extended\r\nduration, have ground down the projected line of the upheaved mass\r\nto the level of the undisturbed masses beside it. Now, mark further,\r\nas we ascend the ravine, that the grand cause of the disturbance\r\nappears to illustrate, as it were, and that very happily, the manner\r\nin which the fault was originally produced. The precipice, over which\r\nthe stream leaps at one bound into the mossy hollow, is composed of\r\ngranitic gneiss, and seems evidently to have intruded itself, with\r\nmuch disturbance, among the surrounding conglomerate and sandstones.\r\nA few hundred yards higher up the dell, there is another much loftier\r\nprecipice of gneiss, round which we find the traces of still greater\r\ndisturbance; and, higher still, yet a third abrupt precipice of the\r\nsame rock. The gneiss rose, trap-like, in steps, and carried up the\r\nsandstone before it in detached squares. Each step has its answering\r\nfault immediately over it; and the fault where the triple bars and\r\nthe conglomerate meet is merely a fault whose step of granitic gneiss\r\nstopped short ere it reached the surface. But the accompanying\r\nsection (see Frontispiece, sect. 4) will better illustrate the\r\ngeology of this interesting ravine, than it can be illustrated by any\r\nwritten description. I may remark, ere taking leave of it, however,\r\nthat its conglomerates exhibit a singularly large amount of false\r\nstratification at an acute angle with the planes of the real strata,\r\nand that a bed of mouldering sandstone near the base of the system\r\nmay be described, from its fissile character, as a tilestone.[AY]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AY: There is a natural connection, it is said, between\r\nwild scenes and wild legends; and some of the traditions connected\r\nwith this romantic and solitary dell illustrate the remark. Till a\r\ncomparatively late period, it was known at many a winter fireside as\r\na favorite haunt of the fairies--the most poetical of all our old\r\ntribes of spectres, and at one time one of the most popular. I have\r\nconversed with an old woman, who, when a very little girl, had seen\r\nmyriads of them dancing, as the sun was setting, on the further edge\r\nof the dell; and with a still older man, who had the temerity to\r\noffer one of them a pinch of snuff at the foot of the cascade. Nearly\r\na mile from where the ravine opens to the sea, it assumes a gentler\r\nand more pastoral character; the sides, no longer precipitous,\r\ndescend towards the stream in green, sloping banks; and a beaten\r\npath, which runs between Cromarty and Rosemarkie, winds down the one\r\nside and ascends the other. More than sixty years ago, one Donald\r\nCalder, a Cromarty shop-keeper, was journeying by this path shortly\r\nafter nightfall. The moon, at full, had just risen; but there was a\r\nsilvery mist sleeping on the lower grounds, that obscured her light;\r\nand the dell, in all its extent, was so overcharged by the vapor,\r\nthat it seemed an immense, overflooded river winding through the\r\nlandscape. Donald had reached its farther edge, and could hear the\r\nrush of the stream from the deep obscurity of the abyss below, when\r\nthere rose from the opposite side a strain of the most delightful\r\nmusic he had ever heard. He staid and listened. The words of a song,\r\nof such simple beauty that they seemed without effort to stamp\r\nthemselves on his memory, came wafted in the music; and the chorus,\r\nin which a thousand tiny voices seemed to join, was a familiar\r\naddress to himself--\"Hey, Donald Calder; ho, Donald Calder.\" \"There\r\nare nane of my Navity acquaintance,\" thought Donald, \"who sing like\r\nthat. Wha can it be?\" He descended into the cloud; but in passing the\r\nlittle stream the music ceased; and on reaching the spot on which\r\nthe singer had seemed stationed, he saw only a bare bank sinking\r\ninto a solitary moor, unvaried by either bush or hollow in which the\r\nmusician might have lain concealed. He had hardly time, however, to\r\nestimate the marvels of the case, when the music again struck up,\r\nbut on the opposite side of the dell, and apparently from the very\r\nknoll on which he had so recently listened to it. The conviction\r\nthat it could not be other than supernatural overpowered him; and he\r\nhurried homewards under the influence of a terror so extreme, that,\r\nunfortunately for our knowledge of fairy literature, it had the\r\neffect of obliterating from his memory every part of the song except\r\nthe chorus. The sun rose as he reached Cromarty; and he found that,\r\ninstead of having lingered at the edge of the dell for only a few\r\nminutes--and the time had seemed no longer--he had spent beside it\r\nthe greater part of the night.\r\n\r\nThe fairies have deserted the Burn of Eathie; but we have proof,\r\nquite as conclusive as the nature of the case admits, that when\r\nthey ceased to be seen there it would have been vain to have looked\r\nfor them any where else. There is a cluster of turf-built cottages\r\ngrouped on the southern side of the ravine; a few scattered knolls,\r\nand a long, partially wooded hollow, that seems a sort of covered way\r\nleading to the recesses of the dell, interpose between them and the\r\nnearer edge, and the hill rises behind. On a Sabbath morning, nearly\r\nsixty years ago, the inmates of this little hamlet had all gone to\r\nchurch, all except a herd-boy and a little girl, his sister, who\r\nwere lounging beside one of the cottages; when, just as the shadow\r\nof the garden dial had fallen on the line of noon, they saw a long\r\ncavalcade ascending out of the ravine through the wooded hollow. It\r\nwinded among the knolls and bushes; and, turning round the northern\r\ngable of the cottage beside which the sole spectators of the scene\r\nwere stationed, began to ascend the eminence towards the south. The\r\nhorses were shaggy, diminutive things, speckled dun and gray; the\r\nriders, stunted, misgrown, ugly creatures, attired in antique jerkins\r\nof plaid, long gray cloaks, and little red caps, from under which\r\ntheir wild, uncombed locks shot out over their cheeks and foreheads.\r\nThe boy and his sister stood gazing in utter dismay and astonishment,\r\nas rider after rider, each one more uncouth and dwarfish than the one\r\nthat had preceded it, passed the cottage and disappeared among the\r\nbrushwood, which at that period covered the hill, until at length the\r\nentire rout, except the last rider, who lingered a few yards behind\r\nthe others, had gone by. \"What are ye, little mannie? and where are\r\nye going?\" inquired the boy, his curiosity getting the better of his\r\nfears and his prudence. \"Not of the race of Adam,\" said the creature,\r\nturning for a moment in his saddle; \"the People of Peace shall never\r\nmore be seen in Scotland.\"]\r\n\r\nI know comparatively little of the scenery of the middle, or\r\nCornstone formation. Its features in England are bold and striking;\r\nin Scotland, of a tamer and more various character. The Den of\r\nBalruddery is a sweet, wooded dell, marked by no characteristic\r\npeculiarities. Many of the seeming peculiarities of the formation in\r\nForfarshire, as in Fife, may be traced to the disturbing trap. The\r\nappearance exhibited is that of uneven plains, that rise and fall in\r\nlong, undulating ridges--an appearance which any other member of the\r\nsystem might have presented. We find the upper formation associated\r\nwith scenery of great, though often wild beauty; and nowhere is this\r\nmore strikingly the case than in the province of Moray, where it\r\nleans against the granitic gneiss of the uplands, and slopes towards\r\nthe sea in long plains of various fertility, deep and rich, as in the\r\nneighborhood of Elgin, or singularly bleak and unproductive, as in\r\nthe far-famed \"heath near Forres.\" Let us select the scene where the\r\nFindhorn, after hurrying over ridge and shallow, amid combinations\r\nof rock and wood, wildly picturesque as any the kingdom affords,\r\nenters on the lower country, with a course less headlong, through a\r\nvast trench scooped in the pale red sandstone of the upper formation.\r\nFor miles above the junction of the newer and older rocks the river\r\nhas been toiling in a narrow and uneven channel, between two upright\r\nwalls of hard gray gneiss, thickly traversed, in every complexity of\r\npattern, by veins of a light red, large grained granite. The gneiss\r\nabruptly terminates, but not so the wall of precipices. A lofty front\r\nof gneiss is joined to a lofty front of sandstone, like the front\r\nwalls of two adjoining houses; and the broken and uptilted strata\r\nof the softer stone show that the older and harder rocks must have\r\ninvaded it from below. A little farther down the stream, the strata\r\nassume what seems, in a short extent of frontage, a horizontal\r\nposition, like courses of ashlar in a building, but which, when\r\nviewed in the range, is found to incline at a low angle towards the\r\ndistant sea. Here, as in many other localities, the young geologist\r\nmust guard against the conclusion, that the rock is necessarily low\r\nin the geological scale which he finds resting against the gneiss.\r\nThe gneiss, occupying a very different place from that on which\r\nit was originally formed, has been thrust into close neighborhood\r\nwith widely separated formations. The great conglomerate base of\r\nthe system rests over it in Orkney, Caithness, Ross, Cromarty, and\r\nInverness; and there is no trace of what should be the intervening\r\ngrauwacke. The upper formation of the system leans upon it here. We\r\nfind the Lower Lias uptilted against it at the Hill of Eathie--the\r\ngreat Oolite on the eastern coast of Sutherland; and as the flints\r\nand chalk fossils of Banff and Aberdeen are found lying immediately\r\nover it in these counties, it is probable that the denuded members\r\nof the Cretaceous group once rested upon it there. The fact that a\r\ndeposit should be found lying in contact with the gneiss, furnishes\r\nno argument for the great antiquity or the fundamental character of\r\nthat deposit; and it were well that the geologist who sets himself to\r\nestimate the depth of the Old Red Sandstone, or the succession of its\r\nvarious formations, should keep the circumstance in view. That may be\r\nin reality but a small and upper portion of the system which he finds\r\nbounded by the gneiss on its under side, and by the diluvium on its\r\nupper.\r\n\r\nWe stand on a wooded eminence, that sinks perpendicularly into the\r\nriver on the left, in a mural precipice, and descends with a billowy\r\nswell into the broad, fertile plain in front, as if the uplands were\r\nbreaking in one vast wave upon the low country. There is a patch\r\nof meadow on the opposite side of the stream, shaded by a group\r\nof ancient trees, gnarled and mossy, and with half their topmost\r\nbranches dead and white as the bones of a skeleton. We look down upon\r\nthem from an elevation so commanding, that their uppermost twigs\r\nseem on well nigh the same level with their interlaced and twisted\r\nroots, washed bare on the bank edge by the winter floods. A colony of\r\nherons has built from time immemorial among the branches. There are\r\ntrees so laden with nests that the boughs bend earthwards on every\r\nside, like the boughs of orchard trees in autumn; and the bleached\r\nand feathered masses which they bear--the cradles of succeeding\r\ngenerations--glitter gray through the foliage in continuous groups,\r\nas if each tree bore on its single head all the wigs of the Court of\r\nSession. The solitude is busy with the occupations and enjoyments\r\nof instinct. The birds, tall and stately, stand by troops in the\r\nshallows, or wade warily, as the fish glance by, to the edge of the\r\ncurrent, or rising, with the slow flap of wing and sharp creak\r\npeculiar to the tribe, drop suddenly into their nests. The great\r\nforest of Darnaway stretches beyond, feathering a thousand knolls,\r\nthat reflect a colder and grayer tint as they recede, and lessen,\r\nand present on the horizon a billowy line of blue. The river brawls\r\nalong under pale red cliffs, wooded a-top. It is through a vast\r\nburial-yard that it has cut its way--a field of the dead so ancient,\r\nthat the sepulchres of Thebes and Luxor are but of the present day in\r\ncomparison--resting-places for the recently departed, whose funerals\r\nare but just over. These mouldering strata are charged with remains,\r\nscattered and detached as those of a churchyard, but not less entire\r\nin their parts--occipital bones, jaws, teeth, spines, scales--the\r\ndust and rubbish of a departed creation. The cliffs sink as the\r\nplain flattens, and green, sloping banks of diluvium take their\r\nplace; but they again rise in the middle distance into an abrupt and\r\nlofty promontory, that, stretching like an immense rib athwart the\r\nlevel country, projects far into the stream, and gives an angular\r\ninflection to its course. There ascends from the apex a thin, blue\r\ncolumn of smoke--that of a lime-kiln. That ridge and promontory are\r\ncomposed of the thick limestone band, which, in Moray as in Fife,\r\nseparates the pale red from the pale yellow beds of the Upper Old\r\nRed Sandstone; and the flattened tracts on both sides show how much\r\nbetter it has resisted the denuding agencies than either the yellow\r\nstrata that rests over it, or the pale red strata which it overlies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two Aspects in which.

We may consider it simply as it exists,\r\nin space, or as it exists in time. As it exists in space we inquire\r\ninto its composition, or, in other words, endeavor to discover\r\nwhat are the elementary bodies that coexist in the space which it\r\noccupies; as it exists in time, we inquire into its susceptibilities\r\nor its powers, or, in other words, endeavor to trace all the various\r\nchanges which have already passed over it, or of which it may yet\r\nbecome the subject.\"\r\n\r\nHitherto I have very much restricted myself to the consideration of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone as it exists in _space_--to the consideration\r\nof it as we now find it. I shall now attempt presenting it to the\r\nreader as it existed in _time_--during the succeeding periods of its\r\nformation, and when its existences lived and moved as the denizens\r\nof primeval oceans. It is one thing to describe the appearance of a\r\nforsaken and desert country, with its wide wastes of unprofitable\r\nsand, its broken citadels and temples, its solitary battle-plains,\r\nand its gloomy streets of caverned and lonely sepulchres; and quite\r\nanother to record its history during its days of smiling fields,\r\npopulous cities, busy trade, and monarchical splendor. We pass from\r\nthe dead to the living--from the cemetery, with its high piles of\r\nmummies and its vast heaps of bones, to the ancient city, full of\r\nlife and animation in all its streets and dwellings.\r\n\r\nTwo great geological periods have already come to their close; and\r\nthe floor of a widely-spread ocean, to which we can affix no limits,\r\nand of whose shores or their inhabitants nothing is yet known, is\r\noccupied to the depth of many thousand feet by the remains of bygone\r\nexistences. Of late, the geologist has learned from Murchison to\r\ndistinguish the rocks of these two periods--the lower as those\r\nof the Cambrian, the upper as those of the Silurian group. The\r\nlower--representative of the first glimmering twilight of being--of a\r\ndawn so feeble that it may seem doubtful whether in reality the gloom\r\nhad lightened--must still be regarded as a period of uncertainty.\r\nIts ripple-marked sandstones, and its half coherent accumulations of\r\ndark-colored strata, which decompose into mud, show that every one\r\nof its many plains must have formed in succession an upper surface\r\nof the bottom of the sea; but it remains for future discoverers to\r\ndetermine regarding the shapes of life that burrowed in its ooze,\r\nor careered through the incumbent waters. In one locality it would\r\nseem as if a few worms had crawled to the surface, and left their\r\ninvolved and tortuous folds doubtfully impressed on the stone.\r\nSome of them resemble miniature cables, carelessly coiled; others,\r\nfurnished with what seem numerous legs, remind us of the existing\r\nNereidina of our sandy shores--those red-blooded, many-legged worms,\r\nresembling elongated centipedes, that wriggle with such activity\r\namong the mingled mud and water, as we turn over the stones under\r\nwhich they had sheltered. Were creatures such as these the lords of\r\nthis lower ocean? Did they enter first on the stage, in that great\r\ndrama of being in which poets and philosophers, monarchs and mighty\r\nconquerors, were afterwards to mingle as actors? Does the reader\r\nremember that story in the _Arabian Nights_, in which the battle of\r\nthe magicians is described? At an early stage of the combat a little\r\nworm creeps over the pavement; at its close two terrible dragons\r\ncontend in an atmosphere of fire. But even the worms of the Cambrian\r\nSystem can scarce be regarded as established. The evidence respecting\r\ntheir place and their nature must still be held as involved in some\r\nsuch degree of doubt as attaches to the researches of the antiquary,\r\nwhen engaged in tracing what their remains much resemble--the\r\ninvolved sculpturings of some Runic obelisk, weathered by the storms\r\nof a thousand winters. There is less of doubt, however, regarding the\r\nexistences of the upper group of rocks--the Silurian.\r\n\r\nThe depth of this group, as estimated by Mr. Murchison, is equal\r\nto double the height of our highest Scottish mountains; and four\r\ndistinct platforms of being range in it, the one over the other,\r\nlike stories in a building. Life abounded on all these platforms,\r\nand in shapes the most wonderful. The peculiar encrinites of the\r\ngroup rose in miniature forests, and spread forth their sentient\r\npetals by millions and tens of millions amid the waters; vast ridges\r\nof corals peopled by their innumerable builders,--numbers without\r\nnumber,--rose high amid the shallows; the chambered shells had\r\nbecome abundant--the simpler testacea still more so; extinct forms of\r\nthe graptolite, or sea-pen, existed by myriads; and the formation\r\nhad a class of creatures in advance of the many-legged annelids of\r\nthe other. It had its numerous family of trilobites,--crustaceans\r\nnearly as high in the scale as the common crab,--creatures with\r\ncrescent-shaped heads, and jointed bodies, and wonderfully\r\nconstructed eyes, which, like the eyes of the bee and the butterfly,\r\nhad the cornea cut into facets resembling those of a multiplying\r\nglass. Is the reader acquainted with the form of the common _Chiton_\r\nof our shores--the little boat-shaped shell-fish, that adheres to\r\nstones and rocks like the limpet, but which differs from every\r\nvariety of limpet, inbearing as its covering a jointed, not a\r\ncontinuous shell? Suppose a chiton with two of its terminal joints\r\ncut away, and a single plate of much the same shape and size, but\r\nwith two eyes near the centre, substituted instead, and the animal,\r\nin form at least, would be no longer a chiton, but a trilobite. There\r\nare appearances, too, which lead to the inference that the habits of\r\nthe two families, though representing different orders of being, may\r\nnot have been very unlike. The chiton attaches itself to the rock\r\nby a muscular sucker or foot, which, extending vent rally along its\r\nentire length, resembles that of the slug or the snail, and enables\r\nit to crawl like them, but still more slowly, by a succession of\r\nadhesions. The locomotive powers of the trilobite seem to have been\r\nlittle superior to those of the chiton. If furnished with legs at\r\nall, it must have been with soft rudimentary membranaceous legs,\r\nlittle fitted for walking with; and it seems quite as probable, from\r\nthe peculiarly shaped under margin of its shell, formed, like that\r\nof the chiton, for adhering to flat surfaces, that, like the slug\r\nand the snail, it was unfurnished with legs of any kind, and crept\r\non the abdomen. The vast conglomerations of trilobites for which the\r\nSilurian rocks are remarkable, are regarded as further evidence of a\r\nsedentary condition, Like _Ostreæ_, _Chitones_, and other sedentary\r\nanimals, they seemed to have adhered together in vast clusters,\r\ntrilobite over trilobite, in the hollows of submarine precipices, or\r\non the flat, muddy bottom below. And such were the master existences\r\nof three of the four Silurian platforms, and of the greater part of\r\nthe fourth, if, indeed, we may not regard the chambered molluscs,\r\ntheir contemporaries,--creatures with their arms clustered round\r\ntheir heads, and with a nervous system composed of a mere knotted\r\ncord,--as equally high in the scale. We rise to the topmost layers of\r\nthe system,--to an upper gallery of its highest platform,--and find\r\nnature mightily in advance.\r\n\r\nAnother and superior order of existences had sprung into being at\r\nthe fiat of the Creator--creatures with the brain lodged in the\r\nhead, and the spinal cord enclosed in a vertebrated column. In the\r\nperiod of the Upper Silurian, fish properly so called, and of very\r\nperfect organization, had become denizens of the watery element,\r\nand had taken precedence of the crustacean, as, at a period long\r\nprevious, the crustacean had taken precedence of the annelid. In\r\nwhat form do these, the most ancient beings of their class, appear?\r\nAs cartilaginous fishes of the higher order. Some of them were\r\nfurnished with bony palates, and squat, firmly-based teeth, well\r\nadapted for crushing the stone-cased zoöphytes and shells of the\r\nperiod, fragments of which occur in their fœcal remains; some with\r\nteeth that, like those of the fossil sharks of the later formations,\r\nresemble lines of miniature pyramids, larger and smaller alternating;\r\nsome with teeth sharp, thin, and so deeply serrated that every\r\nindividual tooth resembles a row of poniards set upright against the\r\nwalls of an armory; and these last, says Agassiz, furnished with\r\nweapons so murderous, must have been the pirates of the period. Some\r\nhad their fins guarded with long spines, hooked like the beak of\r\nan eagle; some with spines of straighter and more slender form, and\r\nribbed and furrowed longitudinally like columns; some were shielded\r\nby an armor of bony points; and some thickly covered with glistening\r\nscales. If many ages must have passed ere fishes appeared, there was\r\nassuredly no time required to elevate their lower into their higher\r\nfamilies. Judging, too, from this ancient deposit, they seem to have\r\nbeen introduced, not by individuals and pairs, but by whole myriads.\r\n\r\n   \"Forthwith, the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,\r\n    With fry innumerable swarmed; and shoals\r\n    Of fish, that with their fins and shining scales\r\n    Glide under the green wave in plumps and sculls,\r\n    Banked the mid sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe fish-bed of the Upper Ludlow Rock abounds more in osseous remains\r\nthan an ancient burying-ground. The stratum, over wide areas, seems\r\nan almost continuous layer of matted bones, jaws, teeth, spines,\r\nscales, palatal plates, and shagreen-like prickles, all massed\r\ntogether, and converted into a substance of so deep and shining\r\na jet color, that the bed, when \"first discovered, conveyed the\r\nimpression,\" says Mr. Murchison, \"that it enclosed a triturated heap\r\nof black beetles.\" And such are the remains of what seem to have\r\nbeen the first existing vertebrata. Thus, ere our history begins,\r\nthe existences of two great systems, the Cambrian and the Silurian,\r\nhad passed into extinction, with the exception of what seem a few\r\nconnecting links, exclusively molluscs, that are found in England\r\nto pass from the higher beds of the Ludlow rocks into the Lower\r\nor Tilestone beds of the Old Red Sandstone.[AZ] The exuviæ of at\r\nleast four platforms of being lay entombed furlong below furlong,\r\namid the gray, mouldering mudstones, the harder arenaceous beds, the\r\nconsolidated clays, and the concretionary limestones, that underlay\r\nthe ancient ocean of the Lower Old Red. The earth had already become\r\na vast sepulchre, to a depth beneath the bed of the sea equal to at\r\nleast twice the height of Ben Nevis over its surface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AZ: \"Upwards of eight hundred extinct species of animals\r\nhave been described as belonging to the earliest, or Protozoic and\r\nSilurian period, and of these only about one hundred are found also\r\nin the overlying Devonian series; while but fifteen are common to\r\nthe whole Palæozoic period, and not one extends beyond it.\"--(_M. de\r\nVerneuil and Count D'Archiac_, quoted by Mr. D. T. Ansted. 1844.)]\r\n\r\nThe first scene in the _Tempest_ opens amid the confusion and turmoil\r\nof the hurricane--amid thunders and lightnings, the roar of the\r\nwind, the shouts of the seamen, the rattling of cordage, and the\r\nwild dash of the billows. The history of the period represented by\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone seems, in what now forms the northern half of\r\nScotland, to have opened in a similar manner. The finely-laminated\r\nlower Tilestones of England were deposited evidently in a calm sea.\r\nDuring the contemporary period in our own country, the vast space\r\nwhich now includes Orkney and Loch Ness, Dingwall, and Gamrie, and\r\nmany a thousand square mile besides, was the scene of a shallow\r\nocean, perplexed by powerful currents, and agitated by waves. A vast\r\nstratum of water-rolled pebbles, varying in depth from a hundred feet\r\nto a hundred yards, remains in a thousand different localities, to\r\ntestify of the disturbing agencies of this time of commotion. The\r\nhardest masses which the stratum encloses,--porphyries of vitreous\r\nfracture that cut glass as readily as flint, and masses of quartz\r\nthat strike fire quite as profusely from steel,--are yet polished\r\nand ground down into bullet-like forms, not an angular fragment\r\nappearing in some parts of the mass for yards together. The debris\r\nof our harder rocks rolled for centuries in the beds of our more\r\nimpetuous rivers, or tossed for ages along our more exposed and\r\nprecipitous sea-shores, could not present less equivocally the marks\r\nof violent and prolonged attrition than the pebbles of this bed. And\r\nyet it is surely difficult to conceive how the bottom of any sea\r\nshould have been so violently and so equally agitated for so greatly\r\nextended a space as that which intervenes between Mealforvony in\r\nInverness-shire and Pomona in Orkney in one direction, and between\r\nApplecross and Trouphead in another--and for a period so prolonged,\r\nthat the entire area should have come to be covered with a stratum\r\nof rolled pebbles of almost every variety of ancient rock, fifteen\r\nstories' height in thickness. The very variety of its contents shows\r\nthat the period must have been prolonged. A sudden flood sweeps away\r\nwith it the accumulated debris of a range of mountains; but to blend\r\ntogether, in equal mixture, the debris of many such ranges, as well\r\nas to grind down their roughnesses and angularities, and fill up the\r\ninterstices with the sand and gravel produced in the process, must\r\nbe a work of time. I have examined with much interest, in various\r\nlocalities, the fragments of ancient rock inclosed in this formation.\r\nMany of them are no longer to be found in situ, and the group is\r\nessentially different from that presented by the more modern gravels.\r\nOn the shores of the Frith of Cromarty, for instance, by far the most\r\nabundant pebbles are of a blue schistose gneiss: fragments of gray\r\ngranite and white quartz are also common; and the sea-shore at half\r\nebb presents at a short distance the appearance of a long belt of\r\nbluish gray, from the color of the prevailing stones which compose\r\nit. The prevailing color of the conglomerate of the district, on the\r\ncontrary, is a deep red. It contains pebbles of small-grained, red\r\ngranite, red quartz rock, red feldspar, red porphyry, an impure red\r\njasper, red hornstone, and a red granitic gneiss, identical with\r\nthe well-marked gneiss of the neighboring Sutors. This last is the\r\nonly rock now found in the district, of which fragments occur in the\r\nconglomerate. It must have been exposed at the time to the action of\r\nthe waves, though afterwards buried deep under succeeding formations,\r\nuntil again thrust to the surface by some great internal convulsion,\r\nof a date comparatively recent.[BA]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BA: The vast beds of unconsolidated gravel with which one\r\nof the later geological revolutions has half filled some of our\r\nnorthern valleys, and covered the slopes of the adjacent hills,\r\npresent, in a few localities, appearances somewhat analogous to\r\nthose exhibited by this ancient formation. There are uncemented\r\naccumulations of water-rolled pebbles, in the neighborhood of\r\nInverness, from ninety to a hundred feet in thickness. But this\r\nstratum, unlike the more ancient one, wanted continuity. It must have\r\nbeen accumulated, too, under the operation of more partial, though\r\nimmensely more powerful agencies. There is a mediocrity of size in\r\nthe enclosed fragments of the old conglomerate, which gives evidence\r\nof a mediocrity of power in the transporting agent. In the upper\r\ngravels, on the contrary, one of the agents could convey from vast\r\ndistances blocks of stone eighty and a hundred tons in weight. A new\r\ncause of tremendous energy had come into operation in the geological\r\nworld.]\r\n\r\nThe period of this shallow and stormy ocean passed. The bottom,\r\ncomposed of the identical conglomerate which now forms the summit\r\nof some of our loftiest mountains, sank throughout its wide area to\r\na depth so profound as to be little affected by tides or tempests.\r\nDuring this second period there took place a vast deposit of coarse\r\nsandstone strata, with here and there a few thin beds of rolled\r\npebbles. The general subsidence of the bottom still continued, and,\r\nafter a deposit of full ninety feet had overlain the conglomerate,\r\nthe depth became still more profound than at first. A fine,\r\nsemi-calcareous, semi-aluminous deposition took place in waters\r\nperfectly undisturbed. And here we first find proof that this ancient\r\nocean literally swarmed with life--that its bottom was covered with\r\nminiature forests of algæ, and its waters darkened by immense shoals\r\nof fish.\r\n\r\nIn middle autumn, at the close of the herring season, when the fish\r\nhave just spawned, and the congregated masses are breaking up on\r\nshallow and skerry, and dispersing by myriads over the deeper seas,\r\nthey rise at times to the surface by a movement so simultaneous, that\r\nfor miles and miles around the skiff of the fisherman nothing may be\r\nseen but the bright glitter of scales, as if the entire face of the\r\ndeep were a blue robe spangled with silver. I have watched them at\r\nsunrise at such seasons on the middle of the Moray Frith, when, far\r\nas the eye could reach, the surface has been ruffled by the splash\r\nof fins, as if a light breeze swept over it, and the red light has\r\nflashed in gleams of an instant on the millions and tens of millions\r\nthat were leaping around me, a handbreadth into the air, thick as\r\nhail-stones in a thunder-shower. The amazing amount of life which\r\nthe scene included, has imparted to it an indescribable interest.\r\nOn most occasions the inhabitants of ocean are seen but by scores\r\nand hundreds; for in looking down into their green twilight haunts,\r\nwe find the view bounded by a few yards, or at most a few fathoms;\r\nand we can but calculate on the unseen myriads of the surrounding\r\nexpanse by the seen few that occupy the narrow space visible. Here,\r\nhowever, it was not the few, but the myriads, that were seen--the\r\ninnumerable and inconceivable whole--all palpable to the sight as a\r\nflock on a hill-side; or, at least, if all was not palpable, it was\r\nonly because sense has its limits in the lighter as well as in the\r\ndenser medium--that the multitudinous distracts it, and the distant\r\neludes it, and the far horizon bounds it. If the scene spoke not of\r\ninfinity in the sense in which Deity comprehends it, it spoke of it\r\nin at least the only sense in which man can comprehend it.\r\n\r\nNow, we are much in the habit of thinking of such amazing\r\nmultiplicity of being--when we think of it at all--with reference to\r\nbut the later times of the world's history. We think of the remote\r\npast as a time of comparative solitude. We forget that the now\r\nuninhabited desert was once a populous city. Is the reader prepared\r\nto realize, in connection with the Lower Old Red Sandstone--the\r\nsecond period of vertebrated existence--scenes as amazingly fertile\r\nin life as the scene just described--oceans as thoroughly occupied\r\nwith being as our friths and estuaries when the herrings congregate\r\nmost abundantly on our coasts? There are evidences too sure to\r\nbe disputed that such must have been the case. I have seen the\r\nichthyolite beds, where washed bare in the line of the strata, as\r\nthickly covered with oblong, spindle-shaped nodules as I have ever\r\nseen a fishing bank covered with herrings; and have ascertained\r\nthat every individual nodule had its nucleus of animal matter--that\r\nit was a stone coffin in miniature, holding enclosed its organic\r\nmass of bitumen or bone--its winged, or enamelled, or thorn-covered\r\nichthyolite.\r\n\r\nAt this period of our history, some terrible catastrophe involved\r\nin sudden destruction the fish of an area at least a hundred miles\r\nfrom boundary to boundary, perhaps much more. The same platform\r\nin Orkney as at Cromarty is strewed thick with remains, which\r\nexhibit unequivocally the marks of violent death. The figures are\r\ncontorted, contracted, curved; the tail in many instances is bent\r\nround to the head; the spines stick out; the fins are spread to the\r\nfull, as in fish that die in convulsions. The _Pterichthys_ shows\r\nits arms extended at their stiffest angle, as if prepared for an\r\nenemy. The attitudes of all the ichthyolites on this platform are\r\nattitudes of fear, anger, and pain. The remains, too, appear to\r\nhave suffered nothing from the after attacks of predaceous fishes;\r\nnone such seem to have survived. The record is one of destruction\r\nat once widely spread and total, so far as it extended. There are\r\nproofs that, whatever may have been the cause of the catastrophe,\r\nit must have taken place in a sea unusually still. The scales, when\r\nscattered by some slight undulation, are scattered to the distance\r\nof only a few inches, and still exhibit their enamel entire, and\r\ntheir peculiar fineness of edge. The spines, even when separated,\r\nretain their original needle-like sharpness of point. Rays, well\r\nnigh as slender as horse-hairs, are enclosed unbroken in the mass.\r\nWhole ichthyolites occur, in which not only all the parts survive,\r\nbut even the expression which the stiff and threatening attitude\r\nconveyed when the last struggle was over. Destruction must have come\r\nin the calm, and it must have been of a kind by which the calm was\r\nnothing disturbed. In what could it have originated? By what quiet\r\nbut potent agency of destruction were the innumerable existences of\r\nan area perhaps ten thousand square miles in extent annihilated at\r\nonce, and yet the medium in which they had lived left undisturbed\r\nby its operations? Conjecture lacks footing in grappling with the\r\nenigma, and expatiates in uncertainty over all the known phenomena of\r\ndeath. Diseases of mysterious origin break out at times in the animal\r\nkingdom, and well nigh exterminate the tribes on which they fall. The\r\npresent generation has seen a hundred millions of the human family\r\nswept away by a disease unknown to our fathers. Virgil describes the\r\nfatal murrain that once depopulated the Alps, not more as a poet than\r\nas a historian. The shell-fish of the rivers of North America died in\r\nsuch vast abundance during a year of the present century, that the\r\nanimals, washed out of their shells, lay rotting in masses beside the\r\nbanks, infecting the very air. About the close of the last century,\r\nthe haddock well nigh disappeared, for several seasons together,\r\nfrom the eastern coasts of Scotland; and it is related by Creech,\r\nthat a Scotch shipmaster of the period sailed for several leagues on\r\nthe coast of Norway, about the time the scarcity began, through a\r\nfloating shoal of dead haddocks.[BB]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BB: I have heard elderly fishermen of the Moray Frith\r\nstate, in connection with what they used to term \"the haddock dearth\"\r\nof this period, that, for several weeks ere the fish entirely\r\ndisappeared, they acquired an extremely disagreeable taste, as if\r\nthey had been boiled in tobacco juice, and became unfit for the\r\ntable. For the three following years they were extremely rare on the\r\ncoast, and several years more elapsed ere they were caught in the\r\nusual abundance. The fact related by Creech, a very curious one, I\r\nsubjoin in his own words; it occurs in his third _Letter to Sir John\r\nSinclair_: \"On Friday, the 4th December, 1789, the ship _Brothers_,\r\nCaptain Stewart, arrived at Leith from Archangel, who reported that,\r\non the coast of Lapland and Norway, he sailed many leagues through\r\nimmense quantities of dead haddocks floating on the sea. He spoke\r\nseveral English ships, who reported the same fact. It is certain\r\nthat haddocks, which was the fish in the greatest abundance in the\r\nEdinburgh market, have scarcely been seen there these three years. In\r\nFebruary, 1790, three haddocks were brought to market, which, from\r\ntheir scarcity, sold for 7s. 6d.\"\r\n\r\nThe dead haddocks seen by the Leith shipmaster were floating by\r\nthousands; and most of their congeners among what fishermen term\r\n\"the white fish,\" such as cod, ling, and whiting, also float when\r\ndead; whereas the bodies of fish whose bowels and air-bladders are\r\ncomparatively small and tender, lie at the bottom. The herring\r\nfisherman, if the fish die in his nets, finds it no easy matter to\r\nbuoy them up; and if the shoal entangled be a large one, he fails at\r\ntimes, from the great weight, in recovering them at all, losing both\r\nnets and herrings. Now, if a corresponding difference obtained among\r\nfish of the extinct period--if some rose to the surface when they\r\ndied, while others remained at the bottom--we must, of course, expect\r\nto find their remains in very different degrees of preservation--to\r\nfind only scattered fragments of the floaters, while of the others\r\nmany may occur comparatively entire. Even should they have died\r\non the same beds, too, we may discover their remains separated by\r\nhundreds of miles. The haddocks that disappeared from the coast of\r\nBritain were found floating in shoals on the coasts of Norway. The\r\nremains of an immense body of herrings, that weighed down, a few\r\nseasons since, the nets of a crew of fishermen, in a muddy hollow\r\nof the Moray Frith, and defied the utmost exertions of three crews\r\nunited to weigh them from the bottom, are, I doubt not, in the\r\nmuddy hollow still. On a principle thus obvious it may be deemed\r\nnot improbable that the ichthyolites of the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\nmight have had numerous contemporaries, of which, unless in some\r\ninstances the same accident which killed also entombed them, we can\r\nknow nothing in their character as such, and whose broken fragments\r\nmay yet be found in some other locality, where they may be regarded\r\nas characteristic of a different formation.]\r\n\r\nBut the ravages of no such disease, however extensive, could well\r\naccount for some of the phenomena of this platform of death. It\r\nis rarely that disease falls equally on many different tribes\r\nat once, and never does it fall with instantaneous, suddenness;\r\nwhereas in the ruin of this platform from ten to twelve distinct\r\ngenera seem to have been equally involved; and so suddenly did\r\nit perform its work, that its victims were fixed in their first\r\nattitude of terror and surprise. I have observed, too, that groups\r\nof adjoining nodules are charged frequently with fragments of the\r\nsame variety of ichthyolite; and the circumstance seems fraught with\r\nevidence regarding both the original habits of the creatures, and\r\nthe instantaneous suddenness of the destruction by which they were\r\novertaken. They seem, like many of our existing fish, to have been\r\ngregarious, and to have perished together ere their crowds had time\r\nto break up and disperse.\r\n\r\nFish, have been found floating dead in shoals beside submarine\r\nvolcanoes--killed either by the heated water, or by mephitic gases.\r\nThere are, however, no marks of volcanic activity in connection with\r\nthe ichthyolite beds--no marks, at least, which belong to nearly the\r\nsame age with the fossils. The disturbing granite of the neighboring\r\neminences was not upheaved until after the times of the Oolite.\r\nBut the volcano, if such was the destroying agent, might have been\r\ndistant; nay, from some of the points in an area of such immense\r\nextent, it must have been distant. The beds abound, as has been said,\r\nin lime; and the thought has often struck me that calcined lime, cast\r\nout as ashes from some distant crater, and carried by the winds,\r\nmight have been the cause of the widely-spread destruction to which\r\ntheir organisms testify. I have seen the fish of a small trouting\r\nstream, over which a bridge was in the course of building, destroyed\r\nin a single hour, for a full mile below the erection, by the few\r\ntroughfuls of lime that fell into the water when the centring was\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccessors of the exterminated Tribes.--The Gap slowly filled.--Proof\r\nthat the Vegetation of a Formation may long survive its Animal\r\nTribes.

A few scales and\r\nplates then begin to appear. The fish that had existed outside\r\nthe chasm seem to have gradually gained upon it, as their numbers\r\nincreased, just as the European settlers of America have been gaining\r\non the backwoods, and making themselves homes amid the burial-mounds\r\nof a race extinct for centuries. For a lengthened period, however,\r\nthese finny settlers must have been comparatively few--mere squatters\r\nin the waste. In the beds of stratified clay in which their remains\r\nfirst occur, over what we may term the densely crowded platform of\r\nviolent death, the explorer may labor for hours together without\r\nfinding a single scale.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, however, that this upper bed abounds quite\r\nas much in the peculiar vegetable impressions of the formation as\r\nthe lower platform itself. An abundance equally great occurs in some\r\nlocalities only a few inches over the line of the exterminating\r\ncatastrophe. Thickets of exactly the same algæ, amid which the\r\nfish of the formation had sheltered when living, grew luxuriantly\r\nover their graves when dead. The agencies of destruction which\r\nannihilated the animal life of so extended an area, spared its\r\nvegetation; just as the identical forests that had waved over the\r\nsemi-civilized aborigines of North America continued to wave over\r\nthe more savage red men, their successors, long after the original\r\nrace had been exterminated. The inference deducible from the fact,\r\nthough sufficiently simple, seems in a geological point of view a not\r\nunimportant one. _The flora of a system may long survive its fauna;\r\nso that that may be but one formation, regarded with reference to\r\nplants, which may be two or more formations, regarded with reference\r\nto animals._ No instance of any such phenomenon occurs in the later\r\ngeological periods. The changes in animal and vegetable life appear\r\nto have run parallel to each other from the times of the tertiary\r\nformations down to those of the coal; but in the earlier deposits\r\nthe case must have been different. The animal organisms of the\r\nnewer Silurian strata form essentially different groups from those\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone, and both differ from those of the\r\nCornstone divisions; and yet the greater portion of their vegetable\r\nremains seem the same. The stem-like impressions of the fucoid bed\r\nof the Upper Ludlow Rocks cannot be distinguished from those of\r\nthe ichthyolite beds of Cromarty and Ross, nor these again from the\r\nimpressions of the Arbroath pavement, or the Den of Balruddery.\r\nNor is there much difficulty in conceiving how the vegetation of\r\na formation should come to survive its animals. What is fraught\r\nwith health to the existences of the vegetable kingdom, is in many\r\ninstances a deadly poison to those of the animal. The grasses and\r\nwater-lilies of the neighborhood of Naples flourish luxuriantly amid\r\nthe carbonic acid gas which rests so densely over the pools and\r\nrunnels out of which they spring, that the bird stoops to drink,\r\nand falls dead into the water. The lime that destroys the reptiles,\r\nfish, and insects of a thickly inhabited lake or stream, injures not\r\na single flag or bulrush among the millions that line its edges.\r\nThe two kingdoms exist under laws of life and death so essentially\r\ndissimilar, that it has become one of the common-places of poetry\r\nto indicate the blight and decline of the tribes of the one by the\r\nunwonted luxuriancy of the productions of the other. Otway tells us,\r\nin describing the horrors of the plague which almost depopulated\r\nLondon, that the \"destroying angel stretched his arm\" over the city,\r\n\r\n   \"Till in th' untrodden streets unwholesome grass\r\n    Grew of great stalk, and color gross,\r\n    A melancholic poisonous green.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of deposition went on; a bed of pale yellow saliferous\r\nsandstone settled, tier over tier, on a bed of stratified clay, and\r\nwas itself overlaid by another bed of stratified clay in turn. And\r\nthis upper bed had also its organisms. The remains of its sea-weed\r\nstill spread out thick and dark amid the foldings of the strata, and\r\noccasionally its clusters of detached scales. But the circumstances\r\nwere less favorable to the preservation of entire ichthyolites\r\nthan those under which the organisms of the lower platform were\r\nwrapped up in their stony coverings. The matrix, which is more\r\nmicaceous than the other, seems to have been less conservative,\r\nand the waters were probably less still. The process went on. Age\r\nsucceeded age, and one stratum covered up another. Generations lived,\r\ndied, and were entombed in the ever-growing depositions. Succeeding\r\ngenerations pursued their instincts by myriads, happy in existence,\r\nover the surface which covered the broken and perishing remains\r\nof their predecessors, and then died and were entombed in turn,\r\nleaving a higher platform, and a similar destiny to the generations\r\nthat succeeded. Whole races became extinct, through what process\r\nof destruction who can tell? Other races sprang into existence\r\nthrough that adorable power which One only can conceive, and One\r\nonly can exert. An inexhaustible variety of design expatiated freely\r\nwithin the limits of the ancient type. The main conditions remained\r\nthe same--the minor details were dissimilar. Vast periods passed;\r\na class low in the scale still continued to furnish the master\r\nexistences of creation; and so immensely extended was the term of\r\nits sovereignty, that a being of limited faculties, if such could\r\nhave existed uncreated, and witnessed the whole, would have inferred\r\nthat the power of the Creator had reached its extreme boundary,\r\nwhen fishes had been called into existence, and that our planet was\r\ndestined to be the dwelling-place of no nobler inhabitants. If there\r\nbe men dignified by the name of philosophers, who can hold that the\r\npresent state of being, with all its moral evil, and all its physical\r\nsuffering, is to be succeeded by no better and happier state, just\r\nbecause \"all things have continued as they were\" for some five or\r\nsix thousand years, how much sounder and more conclusive would the\r\ninference have been which could have been based, as in the supposed\r\ncase, on a period perhaps a hundred times more extended?\r\n\r\nThere exist wonderful analogies in nature between the geological\r\nhistory of the vertebrated animals as an order, and the individual\r\nhistory of every mammifer--between the history, too, of fish as\r\na class, and that of every single fish. \"It has been found by\r\nTiedemann,\" says Mr. Lyell, \"that the brain of the fœtus in the\r\nhigher class of vertebrated animals assumes in succession the\r\nvarious forms which belong to fishes, reptiles, and birds, before\r\nit acquires those additions and modifications which are peculiar to\r\nthe mammiferous tribes.\" \"In examining the brain of the mammalia,\"\r\nsays M. Serres, \"at an early stage of life, you perceive the\r\ncerebral hemispheres consolidated, as in fish, in two vesicles\r\nisolated one from the other; at a later period you see them affect\r\nthe configuration of the cerebral hemispheres of reptiles; still\r\nlater, again, they present you with the forms of those of birds;\r\nand finally, at the era of birth, the permanent forms which the\r\nadult mammalia present.\" And such seems to have been the history of\r\nthe vertebrata as an order, as certainly as that of the individual\r\nmammifer. The fish preceded the reptile in the order of creation,\r\njust as the crustacean had preceded the fish, and the annelid\r\nthe crustacean. Again, though the fact be somewhat more obscure,\r\nthe reptile seems to have preceded the bird. We find, however,\r\nunequivocal traces of the feathered tribes in well-marked foot-prints\r\nimpressed on a sandstone in North America, at most not more modern\r\nthan the Lias, but which is generally supposed to be of the same age\r\nwith the New Red Sandstone of Germany and our own country. In the\r\nOolite--at least one, perhaps two formations later--the bones of the\r\ntwo species of mammiferous quadrupeds have been found, apparently of\r\nthe marsupial family; and these, says Mr. Lyell, afford the only\r\nexample yet known of terrestrial mammalia in rocks of a date anterior\r\nto the older tertiary formations. The reptile seems to have preceded\r\nthe bird, and the bird the mammiferous animal. Thus the fœtal history\r\nof the nervous system in the individual mammifer seems typical, in\r\nevery stage of its progress, of the history of the grand division\r\nat the head of which the mammifer stands. Agassiz, at the late\r\nmeeting of the British Association in Glasgow, mentioned an analogous\r\nfact. After describing the one-sided tail of the more ancient fish,\r\nespecially the fish of the Old Red Sandstone,--the subjects of his\r\nillustration at the time,--he stated, as the result of a recent\r\ndiscovery, that the young of the salmon in their fœtal state exhibit\r\nthe same unequally-sided condition of tail which characterizes those\r\nexistences of the earlier ages of the world. The individual fish,\r\njust as it begins to exist, presents the identical appearances which\r\nwere exhibited by the order when the order began to exist. Is there\r\nnothing wonderful in analogies such as these--analogies that point\r\nthrough the embryos of the present time to the womb of Nature, big\r\nwith its multitudinous forms of being? Are they charged with no such\r\nnice evidence as a Butler would delight to contemplate, regarding\r\nthat unique _style_ of Deity, if I may so express myself, which runs\r\nthrough all his works, whether we consider him as God of Nature, or\r\nAuthor of Revelation? In this style of type and symbol did He reveal\r\nhimself of old to his chosen people; in this style of allegory and\r\nparable did He again address himself to them, when he sojourned among\r\nthem on earth.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry of the formation seems scarce inferior in interest to\r\nits zoology; but the chemist had still much to do for Geology, and\r\nthe processes are but imperfectly known. There is no field in which\r\nmore laurels await the philosophical chemist than the geological\r\none. I have said that all the calcareous nodules of the ichthyolite\r\nbeds seem to have had originally their nucleus of organic matter.\r\nIn nine cases out of ten the organism can be distinctly traced; and\r\nin the tenth there is almost always something to indicate where it\r\nlay--an elliptical patch of black, or an oblong spot, from which the\r\nprevailing color of the stone has been discharged, and a lighter hue\r\nsubstituted. Is the reader acquainted with Mr. Pepys's accidental\r\nexperiment, as related by Mr. Lyell, and recorded in the first volume\r\nof the _Geological Transactions?_ It affords an interesting proof\r\nthat animal matter, in a state of putrefaction, proves a powerful\r\nagent in the decomposition of mineral substances held in solution,\r\nand of their consequent precipitation. An earthen pitcher, containing\r\nseveral quarts of sulphate of iron, had been suffered to remain\r\nundisturbed and unexamined in a corner of Mr. Pepys's laboratory for\r\nabout a twelvemonth. Some luckless mice had meanwhile fallen into\r\nit, and been drowned; and when it at length came to be examined, an\r\noily scum, and a yellow, sulphureous powder, mixed with hairs, were\r\nseen floating on the top, and the bones of the mice discovered lying\r\nat the bottom; and it was found, that over the decaying bodies the\r\nmineral components of the fluid had been separated and precipitated\r\nin a dark-colored sediment, consisting of grains of pyrites and of\r\nsulphur, of copperas in its green and crystalline form, and of black\r\noxide of iron. The animal and mineral matters had mutually acted\r\nupon one another; and the metallic sulphate, deprived of its oxygen\r\nin the process, had thus cast down its ingredients. It would seem\r\nthat over the putrefying bodies of the fish of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone the water had deposited, in like manner, the lime with\r\nwhich it was charged; and hence the calcareous nodules in which we\r\nfind their remains enclosed. The form of the nodule almost invariably\r\nagrees with that of the ichthyolite within; it is a coffin in the\r\nancient Egyptian style. Was the ichthyolite twisted half round\r\nin the contorted attitude of violent death? the nodule has also\r\nits twist. Did it retain its natural posture? the nodule presents\r\nthe corresponding spindle form. Was it broken up, and the outline\r\ndestroyed? the nodule is flattened and shapeless. In almost every\r\ninstance the form of the organism seems to have regulated that of\r\nthe stone. We may trace, in many of these concretionary masses, the\r\noperations of three distinct principles, all of which must have been\r\nin activity at one and the same time. They are wrapped concentrically\r\neach round its organism: they split readily in the line of the\r\nenclosing stratum, and are marked by its alternating rectilinear bars\r\nof lighter and darker color; and they are radiated from the centre\r\nto the circumference. Their concentric condition shows the chemical\r\ninfluences of the decaying animal matter; their fissile character\r\nand parallel layers of color indicate the general deposition which\r\nwas taking place at the time; and their radiated structure testifies\r\nto that law of crystalline attraction, through which, by a wonderful\r\nmasonry, the invisible but well-cut atoms build up their cubes, their\r\nrhombs, their hexagons, and their pyramids, and are at once the\r\narchitects and the materials of the structure which they rear.\r\n\r\nAnother and very different chemical effect of organic matter may be\r\nremarked in the darker colored arenaceous deposits of the formation,\r\nand occasionally in the stratified clays and nodules of the\r\nichthyolite bed. In a print-work, the whole web is frequently thrown\r\ninto the vat and dyed of one color; but there afterwards comes a\r\ndischarging process: some chemical mixture is dropped on the fabric;\r\nthe dye disappears wherever the mixture touches; and in leaves, and\r\nsprigs, and patches, according to the printer's pattern, the cloth\r\nassumes its original white. Now the colored deposits of the Old Red\r\nSandstone have, in like manner, been subjected to a discharging\r\nprocess. The dye has disappeared in oblong or circular patches of\r\nvarious sizes, from the eighth of an inch to a foot in diameter; the\r\noriginal white has taken its place; and so thickly are these speckles\r\ngrouped in some of the darker-tinted beds, that the surfaces, where\r\nwashed by the sea, present the appearance of sheets of calico. The\r\ndischarging agent was organic matter; the uncolored patches are no\r\nmere surface films, for, when cut at right angles, their depth is\r\nfound to correspond with their breadth, the circle is a sphere, the\r\nellipsis forms the section of an egg-shaped body, and in the centre\r\nof each we generally find traces of the organism in whose decay it\r\noriginated. I have repeatedly found single scales, in the ichthyolite\r\nbeds, surrounded by uncolored spheres about the size of musket\r\nbullets. It is well for the young geologist carefully to mark such\r\nappearances--to trace them through the various instances in which the\r\norganism may be recognized and identified, to those in which its last\r\nvestiges have disappeared. They are the hatchments of the geological\r\nworld, and indicate that life once existed where all other record of\r\nit has perished.[BC]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BC: Some of the clay-slates of the primary formations\r\nabound in these circular, uncolored patches, bearing in their\r\ncentres, like the patches of the Old Red Sandstone, half obliterated\r\nnuclei of black. Were they, too, once fossiliferous? and do these\r\nblank erasures remain to testify to the fact? I find the organic\r\norigin of the patches in the Old Red Sandstone remarked by Professor\r\nFleming as early as the year 1830, and the remark reiterated by\r\nDr. Anderson, of Newburgh, in nearly the same words, but with no\r\nacknowledgment, ten years later. The following is the minute and\r\nsingularly faithful description of the Professor:--\r\n\r\n\"On the surface of the strata in the lower beds, circular spots,\r\nnearly a foot in diameter, may be readily perceived by their pale\r\nyellow colors, contrasted with the dark red of the surrounding rock.\r\nThese spots, however, are not, as may at first be supposed, mere\r\nsuperficial films, but derive their circular form from a colored\r\nsphere to which they belong. This sphere is not to be distinguished\r\nfrom the rest of the bed by any difference in mechanical structure,\r\nbut merely by the absence of much of that oxide of iron with which\r\nthe other portion of the mass is charged. The circumference of this\r\ncolored sphere is usually well defined; and at its centre may always\r\nbe observed matter of a darker color, in some cases disposed in\r\nconcentric layers, in others of calcareous and crystalline matter,\r\nthe remains probably of some vegetable or animal organism, the\r\ndecomposition of which exercised a limited influence on the coloring\r\nmatter of the surrounding rock. In some cases I have observed these\r\nspheres slightly compressed at opposite sides, in a direction\r\nparallel with the plane of stratification--the result, without doubt,\r\nof the subsidence or contraction of the mass, after the central\r\nmatter or nucleus had ceased to exercise its influence.\"--(_Cheek's\r\nEdinburgh Journal_, Feb. 1831, p. 82.)]\r\n\r\nIt is the part of the chemist to tell us by what peculiar action of\r\nthe organic matter the dye was discharged in these spots and patches.\r\nBut how was the dye itself procured? From what source was the immense\r\namount of iron derived, which gives to nearly five sixths of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone the characteristic color to which it owes its name? An\r\nexamination of its lowest member, the great conglomerate, suggests\r\na solution of the query. I have adverted to the large proportion of\r\nred-colored pebbles which this member contains, and, among the rest,\r\nto a red granitic gneiss, which must have been exposed over wide\r\nareas at the time of its deposition, and which, after the lapse of a\r\nperiod which extended from at least the times of the Lower Old Red to\r\nthose of the Upper Oolite, was again thrust upwards to the surface,\r\nto form the rectilinear chain of precipitous eminences to which\r\nthe hills of Cromarty and of Nigg belong. This rock is now almost\r\nthe sole representative, in the north of Scotland, of the ancient\r\nrocks whence the materials of the Old Red Sandstone were derived. It\r\nabounds in hæmatic iron ore, diffused as a component of the stone\r\nthroughout the entire mass, and which also occurs in it in ponderous\r\ninsulated blocks of great richness, and in thin, thread-like veins.\r\nWhen ground down, it forms a deep red pigment, undistinguishable in\r\ntint from the prevailing color of the sandstone, and which leaves a\r\nstain so difficult to be effaced, that shepherds employ it in some\r\nparts of the Highlands for marking their sheep. Every rawer fragment\r\nof the rock bears its hæmatic tinge; and were the whole ground by\r\nsome mechanical process into sand, and again consolidated, the\r\nproduce of the experiment would be undoubtedly a deep red sandstone.\r\nIn an upper member of the lower formation--that immediately over the\r\nichthyolite beds--different materials seem to have been employed.\r\nA white, quartzy sand and a pale-colored clay form the chief\r\ningredients; and though the ochry-tinted coloring matter be also\r\niron, it is iron existing in a different condition, and in a more\r\ndiluted form. The oxide deposited by the chalybeate springs which\r\npass through the lower members of the formation, would give to white\r\nsand a tinge exactly resembling the tint borne by this upper member.\r\n\r\nThe passage of metals from lower to higher formations, and from\r\none combination to another, constitutes surely a highly interesting\r\nsubject of inquiry. The transmission of iron in a chemical form,\r\nthrough chalybeate springs, from deposits in which it had been\r\ndiffused in a form merely mechanical, is of itself curious; but how\r\nmuch more so its passage and subsequent accumulation, as in bog-iron\r\nand the iron of the Coal Measures, through the agency of vegetation!\r\nHow strange, if the steel axe of the woodman should have once formed\r\npart of an ancient forest!--if, after first existing as a solid\r\nmass in a primary rock, it should next have come to be diffused as\r\na red pigment in a transition conglomerate--then as a brown oxide\r\nin a chalybeate spring--then as a yellowish ochre in a secondary\r\nsandstone--then as a component part in the stems and twigs of a thick\r\nforest of arboraceous plants--then again as an iron carbonate, slowly\r\naccumulating at the bottom of a morass of the Coal Measures--then\r\nas a layer of indurated bands and nodules of brown ore, underlying\r\na seam of coal--and then, finally, that it should have been dug\r\nout, and smelted, and fashioned, and employed for the purpose of\r\nhandicraft, and yet occupy, even at this stage, merely a middle place\r\nbetween the transmigrations which have passed, and the changes which\r\nare yet to come. Crystals of galena sometimes occur in the nodular\r\nlimestones of the Old Red Sandstone; but I am afraid the chemist\r\nwould find it difficult to fix their probable genealogy.\r\n\r\nIn at least one respect, every geological history must of necessity\r\nbe unsatisfactory; and, ere I pass to the history of the two upper\r\nformations of the system, the reader must permit me to remind him of\r\nit. There have been individuals, it has been said, who, though they\r\ncould see clearly the forms of objects, wanted, through some strange\r\norganic defect, the faculty of perceiving their distinguishing\r\ncolors, however well marked these might be. The petals of the rose\r\nhave appeared to them of the same sombre hue with its stalk; and they\r\nhave regarded the ripe scarlet cherry as undistinguishable in tint\r\nfrom the green leaves under which it hung. The face of nature to such\r\nmen must have for ever rested under a cloud; and a cloud of similar\r\ncharacter hangs over the pictorial restorations of the geologist.\r\nThe history of this and the last chapter is a mere profile drawn\r\nin black, an outline without color--in short, such a chronicle of\r\npast ages as might be reconstructed, in the lack of other and ampler\r\nmaterials, from tombstones and charnel-houses. I have had to draw\r\nthe portrait from the skeleton. My specimens show the general form\r\nof the creatures I attempt to describe, and not a few of their more\r\nmarked peculiarities; but many of the nicer elegancies are wanting;\r\nand the \"complexion to which they have come\" leaves no trace by which\r\nto discover the complexion they originally bore. And yet color is a\r\nmighty matter to the ichthyologist. The \"fins and shining scales,\"\r\n\"the waved coats, dropt with gold,\" the rainbow dyes of beauty of\r\nthe watery tribes, are connected often with more than mere external\r\ncharacter. It is a curious and interesting fact, that the hues of\r\nsplendor in which they are bedecked are, in some instances, as\r\nintimately associated with their instincts--with their feelings, if\r\nI may so speak--as the blush which suffuses the human countenance\r\nis associated with the sense of shame, or its tint of ashy paleness\r\nor of sallow with emotions of rage, or feelings of a panic terror.\r\nPain and triumph have each their index of color among the mute\r\ninhabitants of our seas and rivers. Poets themselves have bewailed\r\nthe utter inadequacy of words to describe the varying tints and\r\nshades of beauty with which the agonies of death dye the scales of\r\nthe dolphin, and how every various pang calls up a various suffusion\r\nof splendor.[BD] Even the common stickleback of our ponds and ditches\r\ncan put on its colors to picture its emotions. There is, it seems, a\r\nmighty amount of ambition, and a vast deal of fighting sheerly for\r\nconquests' sake, among the myriads of this pygmy little fish which\r\ninhabit our smaller streams; and no sooner does an individual succeed\r\nin expelling his weaker companions from some eighteen inches or two\r\nfeet of territory, than straight way the exultation of conquest\r\nconverts the faded and freckled olive of his back and sides into a\r\nglow of crimson and bright green. Nature furnishes him with a regal\r\nrobe for the occasion. Immediately on his deposition, however,--and\r\nevents of this kind are even more common under than out of the\r\nwater,--his gay colors disappear, and he sinks into his original and\r\nnative ugliness.[BE]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BD: The description of Falconer must be familiar to every\r\nreader, but I cannot resist quoting it. It shows how minutely the\r\nsailor poet must have observed. Byron tells us how\r\n\r\n                              \"Parting day\r\n    Dies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues\r\n    With a new color, as it gasps away,\r\n    The last still loveliest, till--tis gone, and all is gray.\"\r\n\r\nFalconer, in anticipating, reversed the simile. The huge animal,\r\nstruck by the \"unerring barb\" of Rodmond, has been drawn on board, and\r\n\r\n   \"On deck he struggles with convulsive pain;\r\n    But while his heart the fatal javelin thrills,\r\n    And flitting life escapes in sanguine rills,\r\n    What radiant changes strike the astonished sight!\r\n    What glowing hues of mingled shade and light!\r\n    Not equal beauties gild the lucid West\r\n    With parting beams o'er all profusely drest;\r\n    Not lovelier colors paint the vernal dawn,\r\n    When Orient dews impearl the enamelled lawn;\r\n    Than from his sides in bright suffusion flow,\r\n    That now with gold empyreal seem to glow;\r\n    Now in pellucid sapphires meet the view,\r\n    And emulate the soft celestial hue;\r\n    Now beam a flaming crimson on the eye,\r\n    And now assume the purple's deeper dye.\r\n    But here description clouds each shining ray--\r\n    What terms of art can Nature's powers display?\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BE: \"In the _Magazine of Natural History_\" says Captain\r\nBrown, in one of his notes to White's _Sellorne_, \"we have a curious\r\naccount of the pugnacious propensities of these little animals.\r\n'Having at various times,' says a correspondent, 'kept these little\r\nfish during the spring and part of the summer months, and paid close\r\nattention to their habits. I am enabled from my own experience to\r\nvouch for the facts I am about to relate. I have frequently kept them\r\nin a deal tub, about three feet two inches wide, and about two feet\r\ndeep. When they are put in for some time, probably a day or two, they\r\nswim about in a shoal, apparently exploring their new habitation.\r\nSuddenly one will take possession of the tub, or, as it will\r\nsometimes happen, the bottom, and will instantly commence an attack\r\nupon his companions; and if any of them venture to oppose his sway,\r\na regular and most furious battle ensues. They swim round and round\r\neach other with the greatest rapidity, biting, (their mouths being\r\nwell furnished with teeth,) and endeavoring to pierce each other\r\nwith their lateral spines, which, on this occasion, are projected.\r\nI have witnessed a battle of this sort which lasted several minutes\r\nbefore either would give way; and when one does submit, imagination\r\ncan hardly conceive the vindictive fury of the conqueror, who, in\r\nthe most persevering and unrelenting way, chases his rival from one\r\npart of the tub to another, until fairly exhausted with fatigue.\r\nFrom this period an interesting change takes place in the conqueror,\r\nwho, from being a speckled and greenish-looking fish, assumes the\r\nmost beautiful colors; the belly and lower jaws becoming a deep\r\ncrimson, and the back sometimes a cream color, but generally a fine\r\ngreen, and the whole appearance full of animation and spirit. I have\r\noccasionally known three or four parts of the tub taken possession\r\nof by these little tyrants, who guard their territories with the\r\nstrictest vigilance, and the slightest invasion brings on invariably\r\na battle. A strange alteration immediately takes place in the\r\ndefeated party: his gallant bearing forsakes him, his gay colors fade\r\naway, he becomes again speckled and ugly, and he hides his disgrace\r\namong his peaceable companions.'\"]\r\n\r\nBut of color, as I have said, though thus important, the\r\nichthyologist can learn almost nothing from Geology. The perfect\r\nrestoration of even a Cuvier are blank outlines. We just know by a\r\nwonderful accident that the Siberian elephant was red. A very few\r\nof the original tints still remain among the fossils of our north\r\ncountry Lias. The ammonite, when struck fresh from the surrounding\r\nlime, reflects the prismatic colors, as of old; a huge Modiola still\r\nretains its tinge of tawny and yellow; and the fossilized wood of the\r\nformation preserves a shade of the native tint, though darkened into\r\nbrown. But there is considerably less of color in the fossils of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone. I have caught, and barely caught, in some of the\r\nnewly disinterred specimens, the faint and evanescent reflection of\r\na tinge of pearl; and were I acquainted with my own collection only,\r\nimagination, borrowing from the prevailing color, would be apt to\r\npeople the ancient oceans, in which its forms existed, with swarthy\r\nraces exclusively. But a view of the Altyre fossils would correct the\r\nimpression. They are enclosed, like those of Cromarty, in nodules\r\nof an argillaceous limestone. The color, however, from the presence\r\nof iron, and the absence of bitumen, is different. It presents a\r\nmixture of gray, of pink, and of brown; and on this ground the\r\nfossil is spread out in strongly contrasted masses of white and\r\ndark red, of blue, and of purple. Where the exuviæ lie thickest,\r\nthe white appears tinged with delicate blue--the bone is but little\r\nchanged. Where they are spread out more thinly, the iron has pervaded\r\nthem, and the purple and deep red prevail. Thus the same ichthyolite\r\npresents, in some specimens, a body of white and plum-blue attached\r\nto fins of deep red, and with detached scales of red and of purple\r\nlying scattered around it. I need hardly add, however, that all this\r\nvariety of coloring is, like the unvaried black of the Cromarty\r\nspecimens, the result, merely, of a curious chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cornstone Formation and its Organisms.--Dwarf\r\nVegetation.--_Cephalaspides._--Huge Lobster.--Habitats of\r\nthe existing Crustacea.--No unapt representation of the\r\nDeposit of Balruddery, furnished by a land-locked Bay in the\r\nneighborhood of Cromarty.--Vast Space occupied by the Geological\r\nFormations.--Contrasted with the half-formed Deposits which\r\nrepresent the existing Creation.--Inference.--The formation of the\r\n_Holoptychius_.--Probable origin of its Siliceous Limestone.--Marked\r\nincrease in the Bulk of the Existences of the System.--Conjectural\r\nCause.--The Coal Measures.--The Limestone of Burdie House Conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe curtain rises, and the scene is new. The myriads of the lower\r\nformation have disappeared, and we are surrounded, on an upper\r\nplatform, by the existences of a later creation. There is sea all\r\naround, as before; and we find beneath a dark-colored, muddy bottom,\r\nthickly covered by a dwarf vegetation. The circumstances diner little\r\nfrom those in which the ichthyolite beds of the preceding period were\r\ndeposited; but forms of life, essentially different, career through\r\nthe green depths, or creep over the ooze. Shoals of _Cephalaspides_,\r\nwith their broad, arrow-like heads, and their slender, angular\r\nbodies, feathered with fins, sweep past like clouds of crossbow\r\nbolts in an ancient battle. We see the distant gleam of scales, but\r\nthe forms are indistinct and dim: we can merely ascertain that the\r\nfins are elevated by spines of various shape and pattern; that of\r\nsome the coats glitter with enamel; and that others--the sharks of\r\nthis ancient period--bristle over with minute thorny points. A huge\r\ncrustacean, of uncouth proportions, stalks over the weedy bottom, or\r\nburrows in the hollows of the banks.\r\n\r\nLet us attempt bringing our knowledge of the present to bear upon\r\nthe past. The larger crustaceæ of the British seas abound most on\r\niron-bound coasts, where they find sheltering places in the deeper\r\nfissures of sea-cliffs covered up by kelp and tangle, or under the\r\nlower edges of detached boulders, that rest unequally on uneven\r\nplatforms of rock, amid forests of the rough-stemmed cuvy. We may\r\ntraverse sandy or muddy shores for miles together, without rinding\r\na single crab, unless a belt of pebbles lines the upper zone of\r\nbeach, where the forked and serrated fuci first appear, or a few\r\nweed-covered fragments of rock here and there occur in groups on\r\nthe lower zones. In this formation, however, the bottom must have\r\nbeen formed of mingled sand and mud, and yet the crustacea were\r\nabundant. How account for the fact? There is, in most instances, an\r\ninteresting conformity between the character of the ancient rocks, in\r\nwhich we find groups of peculiar fossils, and the habitats of those\r\nexistences of the present creation which these fossils most resemble.\r\nThe fisherman casts his nets in a central hollow of the Moray Frith,\r\nabout thirty fathoms in depth, and draws them up foul with masses of\r\na fetid mud, charged with multitudes of that curious purple-colored\r\nzoophyte the sea-pen, invariably an inhabitant of such recesses. The\r\ngraptolite of the most ancient fossiliferous rocks, an existence\r\nof unequivocally the same type, occurs in greatest abundance in a\r\nfinely-levigated mudstone, for it, too, was a dweller in the mud. In\r\nlike manner, we may find the ancient Modiola of the Lias in habitats\r\nanalogous to those of its modern representative the muscle, and\r\nthe encrinite of the Mountain Limestone fast rooted to its rocky\r\nplatform, just as we may see the Helianthoida and Ascidioida of our\r\nseas fixed to their boulders and rocky skerries. But is not analogy\r\nat fault in the present instance? Quite the reverse. Mark how\r\nthickly these carbonaceous impressions cover the muddy-colored and\r\nfissile sandstones of the formation, giving evidence of an abundant\r\nvegetation. We may learn from these obscure markings, that the\r\nplace in which they grew could have been no unfit habitat for the\r\ncrustaceous tribes.\r\n\r\nThere is a little, land-locked bay on the southern shore of the\r\nFrith of Cromarty, effectually screened from the easterly winds by\r\nthe promontory on which the town is built, and but little affected\r\nby those of any other quarter, from the proximity of the neighboring\r\nshores. The bottom, at low ebb, presents a level plain of sand, so\r\nthickly covered by the green grass-weed of our more sheltered sandy\r\nbays and estuaries, that it presents almost the appearance of a\r\nmeadow. The roots penetrate the sand to the depth of nearly a foot,\r\nbinding it firmly together; and as they have grown and decayed in\r\nit for centuries, it has acquired, from the disseminated particles\r\nof vegetable matter, a deep leaden tint, more nearly approaching to\r\nblack than even the dark gray mudstones of Balruddery. Nor is this\r\nthe only effect: the intertwisted fibres impart to it such coherence,\r\nthat, where scooped out into pools, the edges stand up perpendicular\r\nfrom the water, like banks of clay; and where these are hollowed\r\ninto cave-like recesses,--and there are few of them that are not so\r\nhollowed,--the recesses remain unbroken and unfilled for years. The\r\nweeds have imparted to the sand a character different from its own,\r\nand have rendered it a suitable habitat for numerous tribes, which,\r\nin other circumstances, would have found no shelter in it. Now, among\r\nthese we find in abundance the larger crustaceans of our coasts.\r\nThe brown edible crab harbors in the hollows beside the pools;\r\noccasionally we may find in them an overgrown lobster, studded with\r\nparasitical shells and zoöphytes--proof that the creature, having\r\nattained its full size, has ceased to cast its plated covering.\r\nCrustaceans of the smaller varieties abound. Hermit crabs traverse\r\nthe pools, or creep among the weed; the dark green and the dingy,\r\nhump-backed crabs occur nearly as frequently; the radiata cover the\r\nbanks by thousands. We find occasionally the remains of dead fish\r\nleft by the retreating tide; but the living are much more numerous\r\nthan the dead; for the sand-eel has suffered the water to retire,\r\nand yet remained behind in its burrow; and the viviparous blenny\r\nand common gunnel still shelter beside their fuci-covered masses\r\nof rock. Imagine the bottom of this little bay covered up by thick\r\nbeds of sand and gravel, and the whole consolidated into stone, and\r\nwe have in it all the conditions of the deposit of Balruddery--a\r\nmud-colored, arenaceous deposit, abounding in vegetable impressions,\r\nand enclosing numerous remains of crustaceans, fish, and radiata, as\r\nits characteristic organisms of the animal kingdom. There would be\r\nbut one circumstance of difference: the little bay abounds in shells;\r\nwhereas no shells have yet been found in the mudstones of Balruddery,\r\nor the gray sandstones of the same formation, which in Forfar, Fife,\r\nand Moray shires represent the Cornstone division of the system.\r\n\r\nAges and centuries passed, but who can sum up their number? In\r\nEngland, the depth of this middle formation greatly exceeds that of\r\nany of the other two; in Scotland, it is much less amply developed;\r\nbut in either country it must represent periods of scarce conceivable\r\nextent. I have listened to the controversies of opposite schools\r\nof geologists, who, from the earth's strata, extract registers\r\nof the earth's age of an amount amazingly different. One class,\r\nregarding the geological field as if under the influence of those\r\nprinciples of perspective which give to the cottage in front more\r\nthan the bulk and altitude of the mountain behind, would assign\r\nto the present scene of things its thousands of years, but to all\r\nthe extinct periods united merely their few centuries; while with\r\ntheir opponents, the remoter periods stretch out far into the bygone\r\neternity, and the present scene seems but a narrow strip running\r\nalong the foreground. Both classes appeal to facts; and, leaving them\r\nto their disputes, I have gone out to examine and judge for myself.\r\nThe better to compare the present with the past, I have regarded the\r\nexisting scene merely as a _formation_--not as superficies, but as\r\ndepth; and have sought to ascertain the extent to which, in different\r\nlocalities, and under different circumstances, it has overlaid the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of an ancient forest incline towards a river that flows\r\nsluggishly onwards through a deep alluvial plain, once an extensive\r\nlake. A recent landslip has opened up one of the hanging thickets.\r\nUprooted trees, mingled with bushes, lie at the foot of the slope,\r\nhalf buried in broken masses of turf; and we see above a section of\r\nthe soil, from the line of vegetation to the bare rock. There is an\r\nunder belt of clay, and an upper belt of gravel, neither of which\r\ncontains any thing organic; and overtopping the whole we may see\r\na dark-colored bar of mould, barely a foot in thickness, studded\r\nwith stumps and interlaced with roots. Mark that narrow bar: it is\r\nthe geological representative of six thousand years. A stony bar\r\nof similar appearance runs through the strata of the Wealden: it,\r\ntoo, has its dingy color, its stumps, and its interlacing roots;\r\nbut it forms only a very inconsiderable portion of one of the least\r\nconsiderable of all the formations; and yet who shall venture to say\r\nthat it does not represent a period as extended as that represented\r\nby the dark bar in the ancient forest, seeing there is not a\r\ncircumstance of difference between them?\r\n\r\nWe descend to the river side. The incessant action of the current has\r\nworn a deep channel through the leaden-colored silt; the banks stand\r\nup perpendicularly over the water, and downwards, for twenty feet\r\ntogether,--for such is the depth of the deposit,--we may trace layer\r\nafter layer of reeds, and flags, and fragments of driftwood, and find\r\nhere and there a few fresh-water shells of the existing species. In\r\nthis locality, six thousand years are represented by twenty feet.\r\nThe depth of the various fossiliferous formations united is at least\r\nfifteen hundred times as great.\r\n\r\nWe pursue our walk, and pass through a morass. Three tiers of forest\r\ntrees appear in the section laid open by the stream, the one above\r\nthe other. Overlying these there is a congeries of the remains of\r\naquatic plants, which must have grown and decayed on the spot for\r\nmany ages after the soil had so changed that trees could be produced\r\nby it no longer; and over the whole there occur layers of mosses,\r\nthat must have found root on the surface after the waters had been\r\ndrained away by the deepening channel of the river. The six thousand\r\nyears are here represented by that morass, its three succeeding\r\nforests, its beds of aquatic vegetation, its bands of moss, and the\r\nthin stratum of soil which overlies the whole. Well, but it forms,\r\nnotwithstanding, only the mere beginning of a formation. Pile up\r\ntwenty such morasses, the one over the other; separate them by a\r\nhundred such bands of alluvial silt as we have just examined a little\r\nhigher up the stream; throw in some forty or fifty thick beds of sand\r\nto swell the amount; and the whole together will but barely equal the\r\nCoal Measures, one of many formations.\r\n\r\nBut the marine deposits of the present creation have been, perhaps,\r\naccumulating more rapidly than those of our lakes, forests, or\r\nrivers? Yes, unquestionably, in friths and estuaries, in the\r\nneighborhood of streams that drain vast tracts of country, and roll\r\ndown the soil and clay swept by the winter rains from thousands of\r\nhill-sides; but what is there to lead to the formation of sudden\r\ndeposits in those profounder depths of the sea, in which the water\r\nretains its blue transparency all the year round, let the waves rise\r\nas they may? And do we not know that, along many of our shores, the\r\nprocess of accumulation is well nigh as slow as on the land itself?\r\nThe existing creation is represented in the little land-locked bay,\r\nwhere the crustacea harbor so thickly, by a deposit hardly three\r\nfeet in thickness. In a more exposed locality, on the opposite side\r\nof the promontory, it finds its representative in a deposit of\r\nbarely nine inches. It is surely the present scene of things that\r\nis in its infancy! Into how slender a bulk have the organisms of\r\nsix thousand years been compressed! History tells us of populous\r\nnations, now extinct, that flourished for ages: do we not find their\r\nremains crowded into a few streets of sepulchres? 'Tis but a thin\r\nlayer of soil that covers the ancient plain of Marathon. I have\r\nstood on Bannockburn, and seen no trace of the battle. In what lower\r\nstratum shall we set ourselves to discover the skeletons of the\r\nwolves and bears that once infested our forests? Where shall we find\r\naccumulations of the remains of the wild bisons and gigantic elks,\r\ntheir contemporaries? They must have existed for but comparatively\r\na short period, or they would surely have left more marked traces\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nWhen we appeal to the historians, we hear much of a remote antiquity\r\nin the history of man: a more than twilight gloom pervades the\r\nearlier periods; and the distances are exaggerated, as objects appear\r\nlarge in a fog. We measure, too, by a minute scale. There is a tacit\r\nreference to the threescore and ten years of human life; and its term\r\nof a day appears long to the ephemera. We turn from the historians\r\nto the prophets, and find the dissimilarity of style indicating a\r\ndifferent speaker. Ezekiel's measuring-reed is graduated into cubits\r\nof the temple. The vast periods of the short-lived historian dwindled\r\ndown into weeks and days. Seventy weeks indicated to Daniel, in the\r\nfirst year of Darius, the time of the Messiah's coming. Three years\r\nand a half limit the term of the Mohammedan delusion. Seventeen\r\nyears have not yet gone by since Adam first arose from the mould;\r\nnor has the race, as such, attained to the maturity of even early\r\nmanhood. But while prophecy sums up merely weeks and days, when it\r\nrefers to the past, it looks forward into the future, and speaks of\r\na thousand years. Are scales of unequally graduated parts ever used\r\nin measuring different portions of the same map or section--scales so\r\nvery unequally graduated, that, while the parts in some places expand\r\nto the natural size, they are in others more than three hundred times\r\ndiminished? If not,--for what save inextricable confusion would\r\nresult from their use,--how avoid the conclusion, that the typical\r\nscale employed in the same book by the same prophet represents\r\nsimilar quantities by corresponding parts, whether applied to times\r\nof outrage, delusion, and calamity, or set off against that long and\r\nhappy period in which the spirit of evil shall be bound in chains\r\nand darkness, and the kingdom of Christ shall have come? And if such\r\nbe the case--if each single year of the thousand years of the future\r\nrepresents a term as extended as each single year of the seventeen\r\nyears of the past--if the present scene of things be thus merely in\r\nits beginning--should we at all wonder to find that the formation\r\nwhich represents it has laid down merely its few first strata?\r\n\r\nThe curtain again rises. A last day had at length come to the\r\nperiod of the middle formation; and in an ocean roughened by waves,\r\nand agitated by currents, like the ocean which flowed over the\r\nconglomerate base of the system, we find new races of existences. We\r\nmay mark the clumsy bulk of the _Holoptychius_ conspicuous in the\r\ngroup; the shark family have their representatives as before; a new\r\nvariety of the _Pterichthys_ spreads out its spear-like wings at\r\nevery alarm, like its predecessors of the lower formation; shoals\r\nof fish of a type more common, but still unnamed and undescribed,\r\nsport amid the eddies; and we may see attached to the rocks below\r\nsubstances of uncouth form and doubtful structure, with which the\r\noryctologist has still to acquaint himself. The depositions of this\r\nupper ocean are of a mixed character: the beds are less uniform and\r\ncontinuous than at a greater depth. In some places they consist\r\nexclusively of sandstone, in others of conglomerate; and yet the\r\nsandstone and conglomerate seem, from their frequent occurrence\r\non the same platform, to have been formed simultaneously. The\r\ntransporting and depositing agents must have become more partial in\r\ntheir action than during the earlier period. They had their foci\r\nof strength and their circumferences of comparative weakness; and\r\nwhile the heavier pebbles which composed the conglomerate were in\r\nthe course of being deposited in the foci, the lighter sand which\r\ncomposes the sandstone was settling in those outer skirts by which\r\nthe foci were surrounded. At this stage, too, there are unequivocal\r\nmarks, in the northern localities, of extensive denudation. The older\r\nstrata are cut away in some places to a considerable depth, and newer\r\nstrata of the same formation deposited unconformably over them. There\r\nmust have been partial upheavings and depressions, corresponding\r\nwith the partial character of the depositions; and, as a necessary\r\nconsequence, frequent shiftings of currents. The ocean, too, seems\r\nto have lessened its general depth, and the bottom to have lain more\r\nexposed to the influence of the waves. And hence one cause, added\r\nto the porous nature of the matrix, and the diffused oxide, of the\r\ndetached, and, if I may so express myself, churchyard character of\r\nits organisms.\r\n\r\nAbove the blended conglomerates and sandstones of this band a\r\ndeposition of lime took place. Thermal springs, charged with\r\ncalcareous matter slightly mixed with silex, seem to have abounded,\r\nduring the period which it represents, over widely-extended areas;\r\nand hence, probably, its origin. An increase of heat from beneath,\r\nthrough some new activity imparted to the Plutonic agencies, would\r\nbe of itself sufficient to account for the formation. I have\r\nresided in a district in which almost every spring was charged with\r\ncalcareous earth; but in cisterns or draw-wells, or the utensils\r\nin which the housewife stored up for use the water which these\r\nsupplied, no deposition took place. With boilers and tea-kettles,\r\nhowever, the case was different. The agency of heat was brought to\r\noperate upon these; and their sides and bottoms were covered, in\r\nconsequence, with a thick crust of lime. Now, we have but to apply\r\nthe simple principles on which such phenomena occur, to account\r\nfor widely-spread precipitates of the same earth by either springs\r\nor seas, which at a lower temperature would have been active in\r\nthe formation of mechanical deposits alone. The temperature sunk\r\ngradually to its former state; the purely chemical deposit ceased;\r\nthe waters became populous as before with animals of the same\r\ncharacter and appearance as those of the upper conglomerate; and\r\nlayer after layer of yellow sandstone, to the depth of several\r\nhundred feet, were formed as the period passed. With this upper\r\ndeposit the system terminated.\r\n\r\nThough fish still remained the lords of creation, and fish of\r\napparently no superior order to those with which the vertebrata\r\nbegan at least three formations earlier, they had mightily advanced\r\nin one striking particular. If their organization was in no degree\r\nmore perfect than at first, their bulk at least had become immensely\r\nmore great. The period had gone by in which a mediocrity of dimension\r\ncharacterized the existences of the ancient oceans, and fish armed\r\noffensively and defensively with scales and teeth scarcely inferior\r\nin size to the scales and teeth of the gavial or the alligator,\r\nsprung into existence. It must have been a large jaw and a large\r\nhead that contained, doubtless among many others, a tooth an inch\r\nin diameter at the base. I may remark, in the passing, that most\r\nof the teeth found in the several formations of the system are not\r\ninstruments of mastication, but, like those in most of the existing\r\nfish, mere hooks for penetrating slippery substances, and thus\r\nholding them fast. The rude angler who first fashioned a crooked\r\nbone, or a bit of native silver or copper, into a hook, might have\r\nfound his invention anticipated in the jaws of the first fish he\r\ndrew ashore by its means; and we find the hook structure as complete\r\nin the earlier ichthyolites of the Old Red Sandstone as in the\r\nfish that exist now. The evidence of the geologist is of necessity\r\ncircumstantial evidence, and he need look for none other; but it is\r\ninteresting to observe how directly the separate facts bear, in many\r\nexamples, on one and the same point. The hooked and slender teeth\r\ntell exactly the same story with the undigested scales in the fœcal\r\nremains alluded to in an early chapter.\r\n\r\nIn what could this increase in bulk have originated? Is there a high\r\nbut yet comparatively medium temperature in which animals attain\r\ntheir greatest size, and corresponding gradations of descent on\r\nboth sides, whether we increase the heat until we reach the point\r\nat which life can no longer exist, or diminish it until we arrive\r\nat the same result from intensity of cold? The line of existence\r\nbisects on both sides the line of extinction. May it not probably\r\nform a curve, descending equally from an elevated centre to the\r\npoints of bisection on the level of death? But whatever may have\r\nbeen the cause, the change furnishes another instance of analogy\r\nbetween the progress of individuals and of orders. The shark and\r\nthe sword-fish begin to exist as little creatures of a span in\r\nlength; they expand into monsters whose bodies equal in hugeness\r\nthe trunks of ancient oaks; and thus has it been with the order to\r\nwhich they belong. The teeth, spines, and palatal bones of the fish\r\nof the Upper Ludlow Rocks are of almost microscopic minuteness; an\r\ninvariable mediocrity of dimension characterizes the ichthyolites\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone; a marked increase in size takes\r\nplace among the existences of the middle formation; in the upper the\r\nbulky _Holoptychius_ appears; the close of the system ushers in the\r\nstill bulkier Megalichthys; and low in the Coal Measures we find the\r\nponderous bones, buckler-like scales, and enormous teeth of another\r\nand immensely more gigantic _Holoptychius_--a creature pronounced\r\nby Agassiz the largest of all osseous fish.[BF] We begin with an\r\nage of dwarfs--we end with an age of giants. The march of Nature\r\nis an onward and an ascending march; the stages are slow, but the\r\ntread is stately; and to Him who has commanded, and who overlooks\r\nit, a thousand years are as but a single day, and a single day as a\r\nthousand years.[BG]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BF: There have been fish scales found in Burdie House\r\nfive inches in length, by rather more than four in breadth. Of the\r\ngigantic _Holoptychius_ of this deposit we have still much to learn.\r\nThe fragment of a jaw, in the possession of the Royal Society of\r\nEdinburgh, which belonged to an individual of the species, is 18½\r\ninches in length; and it is furnished with teeth, one of which, from\r\nbase to point, measures five inches, and another four and a half.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BG: See, on this subject, the introductory note to the\r\npresent edition, and note p. 154.]\r\n\r\nWe have entered the Coal Measures. For seven formations\r\ntogether--from the Lower Silurian to the Upper Old Red Sandstone--our\r\ncourse has lain over oceans without a visible shore, though, like\r\nColumbus, in his voyage of discovery, we have now and then found a\r\nlittle floating weed, to indicate the approaching coast. The water\r\nis fast shallowing. Yonder passes a broken branch, with the leaves\r\nstill unwithered; and there floats a tuft of fern. Land, from the\r\nmast-head! land! land!--a low shore, thickly covered with vegetation.\r\nHuge trees, of wonderful form, stand out far into the water. There\r\nseems no intervening beach. A thick hedge of reeds, tall as the\r\nmasts of pinnaces, runs along the deeper bays, like water-flags at\r\nthe edge of a lake. A river of vast volume comes rolling from the\r\ninterior, darkening the water for leagues with its slime and mud,\r\nand bearing with it, to the open sea, reeds, and fern, and cones of\r\nthe pine, and immense floats of leaves, and now and then some bulky\r\ntree, undermined and uprooted by the current. We near the coast, and\r\nnow enter the opening of the stream. A scarce penetrable phalanx of\r\nreeds, that attain to the height and well nigh the bulk of forest\r\ntrees, is ranged on either hand. The bright and glossy stems seem\r\nrodded like Gothic columns; the pointed leaves stand out green at\r\nevery joint, tier above tier, each tier resembling a coronal wreath\r\nor an ancient crown, with the rays turned outwards; and we see a-top\r\nwhat may be either large spikes or catkins. What strange forms of\r\nvegetable life appear in the forest behind! Can that be a club-moss\r\nthat raises its slender height for more than fifty feet from the\r\nsoil? Or can these tall, palm-like trees be actually ferns, and these\r\nspreading branches mere fronds? And then these gigantic reeds!--are\r\nthey not mere varieties of the common horse-tail of our bogs and\r\nmorasses, magnified some sixty or a hundred times? Have we arrived\r\nat some such country as the continent visited by Gulliver, in which\r\nhe found thickets of weeds and grass tall as woods of twenty years'\r\ngrowth, and lost himself amid a forest of corn, fifty feet in height?\r\nThe lesser vegetation of our own country, reeds, mosses, and ferns,\r\nseems here as if viewed through a microscope: the dwarfs have sprung\r\nup into giants, and yet there appears to be no proportional increase\r\nin size among what are unequivocally its trees. Yonder is a group of\r\nwhat seem to be pines--tall and bulky, 'tis true, but neither taller\r\nnor bulkier than the pines of Norway and America; and the club-moss\r\nbehind shoots up its green, hairy arms, loaded with what seems\r\ncatkins above their topmost cones. But what monster of the vegetable\r\nworld comes floating down the stream--now circling round in the\r\neddies, now dancing on the ripple, now shooting down the rapid? It\r\nresembles a gigantic star-fish, or an immense coach-wheel, divested\r\nof the rim. There is a green, dome-like mass in the centre, that\r\ncorresponds to the nave of the wheel, or the body of the star-fish;\r\nand the boughs shoot out horizontally on every side, like spokes from\r\nthe nave, or rays from the central body. The diameter considerably\r\nexceeds forty feet; the branches, originally of a deep green, are\r\nassuming the golden tinge of decay; the cylindrical and hollow leaves\r\nstand out thick on every side, like prickles of the wild rose on the\r\nred, fleshy, lance-like shoots of a year's growth, that will be\r\ncovered, two seasons hence, with flowers and fruit. That strangely\r\nformed organism presents no existing type among all the numerous\r\nfamilies of the vegetable kingdom. There is an amazing luxuriance of\r\ngrowth all around us. Scarce can the current make way through the\r\nthickets of aquatic plants that rise thick from the muddy bottom;\r\nand though the sunshine falls bright on the upper boughs of the\r\ntangled forest beyond, not a ray penetrates the more than twilight\r\ngloom that broods over the marshy platform below. The rank steam of\r\ndecaying vegetation forms a thick blue haze, that partially obscures\r\nthe underwood; deadly lakes of carbonic acid gas have accumulated in\r\nthe hollows; there is silence all around, uninterrupted save by the\r\nsudden splash of some reptile fish that has risen to the surface in\r\npursuit of its prey, or when a sudden breeze stirs the hot air, and\r\nshakes the fronds of the giant ferns or the catkins of the reeds.\r\nThe wide continent before us is a continent devoid of animal life,\r\nsave that its pools and rivers abound in fish and mollusca, and that\r\nmillions and tens of millions of the infusory tribes swarm in the\r\nbogs and marshes. Here and there, too, an insect of strange form\r\nflutters among the leaves. It is more than probable that no creature\r\nfurnished with lungs of the more perfect construction could have\r\nbreathed the atmosphere of this early period, and have lived.\r\n\r\nDoubts have been entertained whether the limestone of Burdie House\r\nbelongs to the Upper Old Red Sandstone or to the inferior Coal\r\nMeasures. And the fact may yet come to be quoted as a very direct\r\nproof of the ignorance which obtained regarding the fossils of\r\nthe older formation, at a time when the organisms of most of the\r\nother formations, both above and below it, had been carefully\r\nexplored. The Limestone of Burdie House is unequivocally and\r\nmost characteristically a Coal Measure limestone. It abounds in\r\nvegetable remains of terrestrial or lacustrine growth, and these,\r\ntoo, the vegetables common to the Coal Measures--ferns, reeds, and\r\nclub-mosses. One can scarce detach a fragment from the mass, that has\r\nnot its leaflet or seed-cone enclosed, and in a state of such perfect\r\npreservation, that there can be no possibility of mistaking its\r\ncharacter. If in reality a marine deposit, it must have been formed\r\nin the immediate neighborhood of a land covered with vegetation. The\r\ndove set loose by Noah bore not back with it a less equivocal sign\r\nthat the waters had abated. Now, in the Upper Old Red Sandstone none\r\nof these plants occur. The deposit is exclusively an ocean deposit,\r\nand the remains in Scotland, until we arrive at its inferior and\r\nmiddle formations, are exclusively animal remains. Its upper member,\r\n\"the yellow sandstone,\" says Dr. Anderson, of Newburgh, \"does not\r\nexhibit a single particle of carbonaceous matter--no trace or film\r\nof a branch having been detected in it, though, if such in reality\r\nexisted, there are not wanting opportunities of obtaining specimens\r\nin some one of the twenty or thirty quarries which have been opened\r\nin the county of Fife in this deposit alone.\" No two bordering\r\nformations in the geological scale have their boundaries better\r\ndefined by the character of their fossils than the Old Red Sandstone\r\nand the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nWe pursue our history no further. Its after course is comparatively\r\nwell known. The huge sauroid fish was succeeded by the equally\r\nhuge reptile--the reptile by the bird--the bird by the marsupial\r\nquadruped; and at length, after races higher in the scale of instinct\r\nhad taken precedence in succession, the one of the other, the\r\nsagacious elephant appeared, as the lord of that latest creation\r\nwhich immediately preceded our own. How natural does the thought\r\nseem which suggested itself to the profound mind of Cuvier, when\r\nindulging in a similar review! Has the last scene in the series\r\narisen, or has Deity expended his infinitude of resource, and reached\r\nthe ultimate stage of progression at which perfection can arrive? The\r\nphilosopher hesitated, and then decided in the negative, for he was\r\ntoo intimately acquainted with the works of the Omnipotent Creator to\r\nthink of limiting his power; and he could, therefore, anticipate a\r\ncoming period in which man would have to resign his post of honor to\r\nsome nobler and wiser creature--the monarch of a better and happier\r\nworld. How well it is, to be permitted to indulge in the expansion\r\nof Cuvier's thought, without sharing in the melancholy of Cuvier's\r\nfeeling--to be enabled to look forward to the coming of a new heaven\r\nand a new earth, not in terror, but in hope--to be encouraged to\r\nbelieve in the system of unending progression, but to entertain no\r\nfear of the degradation or deposition of man! The adorable Monarch of\r\nthe future, with all its unsummed perfection, has already passed into\r\nthe heavens, flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone, and Enoch and\r\nElias are there with him--fit representatives of that dominant race,\r\nwhich no other race shall ever supplant or succeed, and to whose\r\nonward and upward march the deep echoes of eternity shall never cease\r\nto respond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICHTHYOLITES OF THE OLD RED SANDSTONE.\r\n\r\nFROM\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ'S \"POISSONS FOSSILES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n∵ The synonymes here--now supplanted, however--with the names of a\r\nfew doubtful or fictitious species, are given in _Italics_;--the\r\nformer opposite the names ultimately adopted, the latter immediately\r\nunder the names of the determined species.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acanthodes pusillus.\r\n  Actinolepis tuberculatus.\r\n  Asterolepis Asmusii.--Syn. _Chelonichthys Asmusii_.\r\n     \"        apicalis.\r\n     \"        granulata.\r\n     \"        Hœninghausii.\r\n     \"        Malcolmsoni.\r\n     \"        minor.--Syn. _Chelonichthys minor_.\r\n     \"        ornata.\r\n     \"        speciosa.\r\n     \"        _concatenatus_.\r\n     \"        _depressus_.\r\n\r\n  Bothriolepis favosa.--Syn. _Glyptosteus favosus_.\r\n     \"         ornata    \"       \"       _reticulatus_\r\n  Byssacanthus arcuatus.\r\n     \"         crenulatus.\r\n     \"         lævis.\r\n\r\n  Cephalaspis Lewisii.\r\n     \"        Lloydii.\r\n     \"        Lyellii.\r\n     \"        rostratus.\r\n\r\n  Cheiracanthus microlepidotus.\r\n     \"          minor.\r\n     \"          Murchisoni.\r\n  Cheirolepis Cummingiæ.\r\n     \"        Traillii.\r\n     \"        Uragus.\r\n     \"        _splendens_.\r\n     \"        _unilateralis_.\r\n  Chelyophorus pustulatus.\r\n     \"         Verneuilii.\r\n  Cladodus simplex.\r\n  Climatius reticulatus.\r\n  Coccosteus cuspidatus.\r\n     \"       decipiens.--Syn. _latus_.\r\n     \"       maximus.\r\n     \"       oblongus.\r\n  Cosmacanthus Malcolmsoni.\r\n  Cricodus incurvus.--Syn. _Dendrodus incurvus_.\r\n  Ctenacanthus ornatus.\r\n     \"         serrulatus.\r\n  Ctenodus Keyserlingii.\r\n     \"     marginalis.\r\n     \"     parvulus.\r\n     \"     Worthii.\r\n     \"     _radiatus_.\r\n     \"     _serratus_.\r\n  Ctenoptychius priscus.\r\n\r\n  Dendrodus latus.\r\n     \"      minor.\r\n     \"      sigmoides.\r\n     \"      strigatus.\r\n     \"      tenuistriatus.\r\n  Diplacanthus crassispinus.\r\n     \"         longispinus.\r\n     \"         striatulus.\r\n     \"         striatus.\r\n  Diplopterus affinis.\r\n  Diplopterus borealis.--Syn. _Agassizii_.\r\n     \"        macrocephalus.\r\n  Dipterus macrolepidotus.\r\n     \"     _arenaceus_.\r\n     \"     _brachypygopterus_.\r\n     \"     _macropygopterus_.\r\n     \"     _Valenciennesii_.\r\n  Glyptolepis elegans.\r\n     \"        leptopterus.\r\n     \"        microlepidotus.\r\n  Glyptopomus minor.--Syn. _Platygnathus minor_.\r\n\r\n  Haplacanthus marginalis.\r\n  Holoptychius Andersoni.\r\n     \"         Flemingii.\r\n     \"         giganteus.\r\n     \"         Murchisoni.\r\n     \"         nobilissimus.\r\n     \"         Omaliusii.\r\n  Homacanthus arcuatus.\r\n  Homothorax Flemingii.\r\n\r\n  Lamnodus biporcatus.--Syn. _Dendrodus biporcatus_.\r\n     \"     hastatus.--Syn. _Panderi.

What Dr. Buckland said was\r\nnot a mere compliment, that 'he had never been so much astonished in\r\nhis life, by the powers of any man, as he had been by the geological\r\ndescriptions of Mr. Miller. That wonderful man described these\r\nobjects with a felicity which made him ashamed of the comparative\r\nmeagerness and poverty of his own descriptions, in the Bridgewater\r\nTreatise, which had cost him hours and days of labor.' For our own\r\npart we do not hesitate to place Mr. Miller in the front rank of\r\nEnglish prose writers. Without mannerism, without those extravagances\r\nwhich give a factitious reputation to so many writers of the day,\r\nhis style has a classic purity and elegance, which remind one of\r\nGoldsmith and Irving, while there is an ease and a naturalness in the\r\nillustrations of the imagination, which belong only to men of true\r\ngenius.\"\r\n\r\n\"The excellent and lively work of our meritorious, self-taught\r\ncountryman, Mr. Miller, is as admirable for the clearness of its\r\ndescriptions, and the sweetness of its composition, as for the purity\r\nand gracefulness which pervade it.\"--_Edinburgh Review._\r\n\r\n\"A geological work, small in size, unpretending in spirit and manner;\r\nits contents, the conscientious narration of fact; its style, the\r\nbeautiful simplicity of truth; and altogether possessing, for a\r\nrational reader, an interest superior to that of a novel.\"--_Dr. J.\r\nPye Smith._\r\n\r\n\"This admirable work evinces talent of the highest order, a deep and\r\nhealthful moral feeling, a perfect command of the finest language,\r\nand a beautiful union of philosophy and poetry.

With no other advantages than a common\r\neducation, by a careful use of his means, he had been able to give\r\nhimself an excellent education, and to elevate himself to a position\r\nwhich any man, in any sphere of life, might well envy.

It\r\nwould be difficult to find any miscellany superior or even equal to\r\nit; it richly deserves the epithets 'useful and entertaining,' and\r\nI would recommend it very strongly, as extremely well adapted to\r\nform parts of a library for the young, or of a social or circulating\r\nlibrary, in town or country.\"\r\n\r\n_From the Rev. John O. Choules, D. D._--\"I cannot resist the desire\r\nwhich I feel to thank you for the valuable service which you have\r\nrendered to the public by placing this admirable work within the\r\nreach of all who have a desire to obtain knowledge. I am not\r\nacquainted with any similar collection in the English language\r\nthat can compare with it for purposes of instruction or amusement.\r\nI should rejoice to see that set of books in every house in our\r\ncountry. I cannot think of any method by which a father can more\r\nmaterially benefit his children than by surrounding them with good\r\nbooks; and if these charming and attractive volumes can be placed in\r\nthe hands of the young, they will have their tastes formed for good\r\nleading. I shall labor to see the Miscellany circulated among my\r\nfriends, and shall lose no opportunity to commend it every where.\"\r\n\r\n\"They contain an excellent selection of historical, scientific, and\r\nmiscellaneous articles in popular style, from the best writers of the\r\nlanguage. The work is elegantly printed and neatly illustrated, and\r\nis sold very cheap.\"--_Independent Democrat, Concord, N. H._\r\n\r\n\"It is just the book to take up at the close of a busy day; and\r\nespecially will it shed a new charm over autumn and winter in-door\r\nscenes.\"--_Christ. World, Boston._\r\n\r\n\"The information contained in this work is surprisingly great; and\r\nfor the fireside, and the young particularly, it cannot fail to prove\r\na most valuable and entertaining companion.\"--_New York Evangelist._\r\n\r\n\"We are glad to see an American issue of this publication, and\r\nespecially in so neat and convenient a form. It is an admirable\r\ncompilation, distinguished by the good taste which has been shown in\r\nall the publications of the Messrs. Chambers. It unites the useful\r\nand the entertaining.\"--_New York Commercial Advertiser._\r\n\r\n\"It is an admirable compilation, containing interesting memoirs and\r\nhistorical sketches, which are useful, instructive, and entertaining.\r\nEvery head of a family should supply himself with a copy for the\r\nbenefit of his children.\"--_Corning Journal._\r\n\r\n\"The enterprising publishers deserve the thanks of every lover of\r\nthe beautiful and true, for the cheap and tasteful style in which\r\nthey have spread this truly valuable work before the American\r\npeople.\"--_People's Advocate, Pa._\r\n\r\n\"It is filled with subjects of interest, intended for the instruction\r\nof the youthful mind, such as biography, history, anecdotes, natural\r\nphilosophy, &c.\"--_New Orleans Bee._\r\n\r\n\r\nValuable School Books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE ELEMENTS OF MORAL SCIENCE.= By Francis Wayland, D.D. President\r\nof Brown University, and Professor of Moral Philosophy. Fortieth\r\nThousand. 12mo. cloth. Price $1.25.\r\n\r\n∵ This work has been extensively and favorably reviewed and adopted\r\nas a class-book in most of the collegiate, theological, and\r\nacademical institutions of the country.\r\n\r\n_From Rev. Wilbur Fisk, President of the Wesleyan University._\r\n\r\n\"I have examined it with great satisfaction and interest. The work\r\nwas greatly needed, and is well executed. Dr. Wayland deserves the\r\ngrateful acknowledgments and liberal patronage of the public. I need\r\nsay nothing further to express my high estimate of the work, than\r\nthat we shall immediately adopt it as a text-book in our university.\"\r\n\r\n_From Hon. James Kent, late Chancellor of New York._\r\n\r\n\"The work has been read by me attentively and thoroughly, and I think\r\nvery highly of it. The author himself is one of the most estimable of\r\nmen, and I do not know of any ethical treatise, in which our duties\r\nto God and to our fellow-men are laid down with more precision,\r\nsimplicity, clearness, energy, and truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The work of Dr. Wayland has arisen gradually from the necessity of\r\ncorrecting the false principles and fallacious reasonings of Paley.\r\nIt is a radical mistake, in the education of youth, to permit any\r\nbook to be used by students as a text-book, which contains erroneous\r\ndoctrines, especially when these are fundamental, and tend to vitiate\r\nthe whole system of morals. We have been greatly pleased with the\r\nmethod which President Wayland has adopted; he goes back to the\r\nsimplest and most fundamental principles; and, in the statement of\r\nhis views, he unites perspicuity with conciseness and precision.\r\nIn all the author's leading fundamental principles we entirely\r\nconcur.\"--_Biblical Repository._\r\n\r\n\"This is a new work on morals, for academic use, and we welcome\r\nit with much satisfaction. It is the result of several years'\r\nreflection and experience in teaching, on the part of its justly\r\ndistinguished author; and if it is not perfectly what we could wish,\r\nyet, in the most important respects, it supplies a want which has\r\nbeen extensively felt. It is, we think, substantially sound in its\r\nfundamental principles; and being comprehensive and elementary in its\r\nplan, and adapted to the purposes of instruction, it will be gladly\r\nadopted by those who have for a long time been dissatisfied with the\r\nexisting works of Paley.\"--_The Literary and Theological Review._\r\n\r\n\r\n=MORAL SCIENCE, ABRIDGED,= by the Author, and adapted to the use of\r\nSchools and Academies. Twenty-fifth Thousand. 18mo, half cloth. Price\r\n25 cents.\r\n\r\nThe more effectually to meet the desire expressed for a cheap\r\nedition, the present edition is issued at the reduced price of 25\r\ncents per copy, and it is hoped thereby to extend the benefit of\r\nmoral instruction to all the youth of our land. Teachers and all\r\nothers engaged in the training of youth, are invited to examine this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Wayland has published an abridgment of his work, for the use of\r\nschools. Of this step we can hardly speak too highly. It is more than\r\ntime that the study of moral philosophy should be introduced into\r\nall our institutions of education. We are happy to see the way so\r\nauspiciously opened for such an introduction. It has been not merely\r\nabridged, but also re-written. We cannot but regard the labor as well\r\nbestowed.\"--_North American Review._\r\n\r\n\"We speak that we do know, when we express our high estimate of Dr.\r\nWayland's ability in teaching Moral Philosophy, whether orally or by\r\nthe book. Having listened to his instructions, in this interesting\r\ndepartment, we can attest how lofty are the principles, how exact\r\nand severe the argumentation, how appropriate and strong the\r\nillustrations which characterize his system and enforce it on the\r\nmind.\"--_The Christian Witness._\r\n\r\n\"The work of which this volume is an abridgment, is well known as one\r\nof the best and most complete works on Moral Philosophy extant. The\r\nauthor is well known as one of the most profound scholars of the age.\r\nThat the study of Moral Science, a science which teaches goodness,\r\nshould be a branch of education, not only in our colleges, but in our\r\nschools and academies, we believe will not be denied. The abridgment\r\nof this work seems to us admirably calculated for the purpose, and we\r\nhope it will be extensively applied to the purposes for which it is\r\nintended.\"--_The Mercantile Journal._\r\n\r\n\"We hail the abridgment as admirably adapted to supply the deficiency\r\nwhich has long been felt in common school education,--the study of\r\nmoral obligation. Let the child early be taught the relations it\r\nsustains to man and to its Maker, the first acquainting it with the\r\nduties owed to society, the second with the duties owed to God, and\r\nwho can foretell how many a sad and disastrous overthrow of character\r\nwill be prevented, and how elevated and pure will be the sense of\r\nintegrity and virtue?\"--_Evening Gazette._\r\n\r\n\r\nValuable School Books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ELEMENTS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY=, By Francis Wayland, D.D., President\r\nof Brown University. Fifteenth Thousand. 12mo. cloth. Price $1.25\r\n\r\n\"His object has been to write a book, which any one who chooses\r\nmay understand. He has, therefore, labored to express the general\r\nprinciples in the plainest manner possible, and to illustrate them\r\nby cases with which every person is familiar. It has been to the\r\nauthor a source of regret, that the course of discussion in the\r\nfollowing pages, has, unavoidably, led him over ground which has\r\nfrequently been the arena of political controversy. In all such\r\ncases, he has endeavored to state what seemed to him to be truth,\r\nwithout fear, favor, or affection. He is conscious to himself of no\r\nbias towards any party whatever, and he thinks that he who will read\r\nthe whole work, will be convinced that he has been influenced by\r\nnone.\"--_Extract from the Preface._\r\n\r\n\r\n=POLITICAL ECONOMY, ABRIDGED=, by the Author, and adapted to the use\r\nof Schools and Academies. Seventh Thousand. 18mo. half morocco. Price\r\n50 cents.\r\n\r\n∵ The success which has attended the abridgment of \"The Elements\r\nof Moral Science\" has induced the author to prepare an abridgment\r\nof this work. In this case, as in the other, the work has been\r\nwholly re-written, and an attempt has been made to adapt it to the\r\nattainments of youth.\r\n\r\n\"The original work of the author, on Political Economy, has already\r\nbeen noticed on our pages; and the present abridgment stands in no\r\nneed of a recommendation from us. We may be permitted, however, to\r\nsay, that both the rising and risen generations are deeply indebted\r\nto Dr. Wayland, for the skill and power he has put forth to bring a\r\nhighly important subject distinctly before them, within such narrow\r\nlimits. Though 'abridged for the use of academies,' it deserves to\r\nbe introduced into every private family, and to be studied by every\r\nman who has an interest in the wealth and prosperity of has country.\r\nIt is a subject little understood, even practically, by thousands,\r\nand still less understood theoretically. It is to be hoped, this\r\nwill form a class-book, and be faithfully studied in our academics;\r\nand that it will find its way into every family library; not there\r\nto be shut up unread, but to afford rich material for thought and\r\ndiscussion in the family circle. It is fitted to enlarge the mind, to\r\npurify the judgment, to correct erroneous popular impressions, and\r\nassist every man in forming opinions of public measures, which will\r\nabide the test of time and experience.\"--_Boston Recorder._\r\n\r\n\"An abridgment of this clear, common sense work, designed for the\r\nuse of academies is just published. We rejoice to see such treatises\r\nspreading among; the people; and we urge all who would be intelligent\r\nfreemen, to read them.\"--_New York Transcript._\r\n\r\n\"We can say, with safety, that the topics are well selected and\r\narranged; that the author's name is a guarantee for more than\r\nusual excellence. We wish it an extensive circulation.\"--_New York\r\nObserver._\r\n\r\n\"It is well adapted to high schools, and embraces the soundest system\r\nof republican political economy of any treatise extant.\"--_Daily\r\nAdvocate._\r\n\r\n\r\n=THOUGHTS= on the present Collegiate System in the United States. By\r\nFrancis Wayland, D.D. Price 60 cents.\r\n\r\n\"These Thoughts come from a source entitled to a very respectful\r\nattention; and as the author goes over the whole ground of\r\ncollegiate education, criticising freely all the arrangements in\r\nevery department and in all their bearings, the book is very full of\r\nmatter. We hope it will prove the beginning of a thorough discussion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=PALEY'S NATURAL THEOLOGY=, Illustrated by forty plates, and\r\nSelections from the notes of Dr. Paxton, with additional Notes,\r\noriginal and selected, for this edition; with a vocabulary of\r\nScientific Terms. Edited by John Ware, M.D. 12mo. sheep. Price $1.25.\r\n\r\n\"The work before us is one which deserves rather to be studied than\r\nmerely read. Indeed, without diligent attention and study, neither\r\nthe excellences of it can be fully discovered, nor its advantages\r\nrealized. It is, therefore, gratifying to find it introduced, as\r\na text-book, into the colleges and literary institutions of our\r\ncountry. The edition before us is superior to any we have seen, and,\r\nwe believe, superior to any that has yet been published.\"--_Spirit of\r\nthe Pilgrims._\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps no one of our author's works gives greater satisfaction to\r\nall classes of readers, the young and the old, the ignorant and the\r\nenlightened. Indeed, we recollect no book in which the arguments\r\nfor the existence and attributes of the Supreme Being, to be drawn\r\nfrom his works are exhibited in a manner more attractive and more\r\nconvincing.\"--_Christian Examiner._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\nTwo incidences of Ben Wevis (pp. 6 and 182) were changed to Ben\r\nNevis. Ben Wyvis on page 31 was left unchanged as there is a\r\npeak with that name! Some minor typos were corrected. Duplicate\r\nAdvertisements from the front of the book were deleted!\r\n\r\nTo avoid splitting paragraphs by Plate images, text was moved.
