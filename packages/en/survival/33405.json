It is always well to know the object, aim,\r\nand mode of treatment of a book before reading it, so as to be able to\r\nlook at it from the author's view-point.\r\n\r\nFirst: A word about the title--\"Nature's Miracles.\" Some may claim that\r\nit is unscientific to speak of the operations of nature as \"miracles.\"\r\nBut the point of the title lies in the paradox of finding so many\r\nwonderful things--as wonderful as any miracle that was ever\r\nrecorded--subservient to the rule of law.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" you say, \"a miracle does not come under any rule of law.\"\r\n\r\nAh! are you sure of that? It is true that we may not understand the law\r\nthat the so-called miracle comes under, but the Author of all natural\r\nlaw does. We do not pretend to dispute but that the Power that made\r\nnature's laws can change them if He sees fit; but we cannot believe that\r\nHe will ever see fit. It would destroy all order and harmony, all\r\nadvancement in science and knowledge of God's works, not to be able to\r\nrely implicitly upon the laws of nature as consistent and continuous.\r\n\r\nIn putting out these little volumes, it is not to be understood that the\r\nsubjects treated will be more than touched upon, at the most salient\r\npoints. To do much more would require volumes of immense size, and life\r\nwould be too short for me to write or for you to read them.\r\n\r\nAgain: these volumes are \"familiar talks.\" The Author wishes to sit down\r\nwith you--so to speak--and not hold you at arm's length.\r\n\r\nIt will be his aim to use the language of common life and to avoid all\r\ntechnical names so far as possible, or, when they are necessary, to\r\nexplain their meaning. The object is to reach the thousands of readers\r\nwho have not and cannot have the advantages of a scientific education,\r\nbut who can by this means get at least a rudimentary idea of some of the\r\nnatural laws with which they are coming in contact every hour, and\r\nthrough which the inner man has constant communication with the outer\r\nworld. It may be, too, that many young students will be helped by these\r\nplain general views of topics which their text-books will give them in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the real things in the objective world about us and the\r\nlaws that govern them in their inter-relations is of practical value to\r\nevery man, whatever his calling may be. Not only will it be of value\r\npractically, but it will also be a constant source of interest and\r\npleasure. Man is so constituted that he must have something to be\r\ninterested in, and if he has no resources within himself he looks\r\nelsewhere, and often to his hurt, mentally, morally, or otherwise. If he\r\ncould have an interest awakened in him for the study and contemplation\r\nof the natural world he would then have a book to read that is always\r\nopen, always fresh, always new. He is dealing with facts and not theory,\r\nexcept as he uses theory for getting at facts.\r\n\r\nA man who is all theory is like \"a rudderless ship on a shoreless sea.\"\r\nAll he really knows is that he is afloat, and if he lands at all it is\r\nlikely to be in an insane asylum. The mind, in order to keep its\r\nbalance, must have the solid foundation of real things. Theories and\r\nspeculations may be indulged in with safety only so long as they are\r\nbased on facts that we can go back to at all times and know that we are\r\non solid ground.\r\n\r\nIt is the desire and aim of all good men to make their nation a truly\r\ngreat people, with a civilization the highest possible. The character of\r\nall kinds of growth is largely determined by the character of the\r\nmaterial upon which it feeds. The study of natural law can never be\r\nharmful, but is always beneficial, for the student is then working in\r\nharmony with law. It is the violation of law that makes all the trouble\r\nin the world--whether physical, moral, or social. When we speak of\r\nnatural law we do not confine ourselves to what is commonly known as\r\nchemistry and physics, and the laws that govern the material world, but\r\ninclude as well the laws of our own being, as intellectual and spiritual\r\nunits. For all law, physical, intellectual, and spiritual, is in a sense\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\nAll departments of science are simply branches of one great science, and\r\nall phases of human activity are touched by it. The preacher is a better\r\npreacher, the doctor a better doctor, the lawyer a better lawyer, the\r\neditor a better editor, the business man a better merchant, and the\r\nmechanic a better workman, if they follow scientific methods. Indeed,\r\nany man will be a better husband, father, and citizen, if he has some\r\ntrustworthy knowledge of the laws under which this great universe, down\r\nto his own little part of it, lives, moves, and has its being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE'S MIRACLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nWORLD-BUILDING AND LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth\r\nwas without form, and void.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever our speculations may be in regard to a \"beginning,\" and when it\r\nwas, it is written in the rocks, that, like the animals and plants upon\r\nits surface, the earth itself grew; that for countless ages, measured by\r\nyears that no man can number, the earth has been gradually assuming its\r\npresent form and composition, and that the processes of growth and decay\r\nare active every hour.\r\n\r\nThe science that deals with the formations and stratifications that are\r\nfound on the earth and under the earth, and all the forces that have\r\nbeen and are now active in their formation, is called Geology (earth\r\nscience). It is a science about which little is known by the average\r\nindividual, and yet it is one of transcendent interest, from the study\r\nof which the lover of nature can obtain a vast amount of profit and\r\npleasure. When the uncultured man sees a stone in the road it tells him\r\nno story other than the fact that he sees a stone and that it would\r\nbetter be removed; and all the satisfaction he gets out of it is in the\r\nthought that he has saved some unlucky wagon wheel from being wrenched\r\nor broken. The scientist looking at the same stone perhaps will stop,\r\nand with a hammer break it open, when the newly exposed faces of the\r\nrock will have written upon them a history that is as real to him as the\r\nprinted page. He is carried back to a far-off time, where he sees the\r\nprocesses and forces at work that have formed this stone and made it\r\nwhat it is, not only in its outward form, but in its constitution, down\r\nto its molecules and atoms. (The word \"atom\" is used in chemistry to\r\nmean the smallest particle of an elementary substance that will combine\r\nwith the atoms of another substance to form new compounds of matter. And\r\nmolecules are made up of atoms.) The scientist looking at this stone\r\nsees in it not only that mechanical and chemical agencies have\r\ncooperated in the work of its formation, but that animal life itself may\r\nhave been the chief agency in bringing the materials together and giving\r\nform to the peculiar architecture employed in its formation. If it is a\r\npiece of limestone this latter statement will be eminently true.\r\n\r\nHere is a powerful motive for the study of physical science. It is not\r\nto be expected, nor is it possible, that every individual can be a\r\nscientist in the strict sense of the word, but it is possible for\r\neveryone of ordinary intelligence to become familiar with the salient\r\nfacts of science, if only a small portion of the time that is now\r\ndevoted to the reading of literature that is rather harmful than helpful\r\nbe spent in studying the phenomena and works of nature.\r\n\r\nThe acquirement of such knowledge would furnish every individual with a\r\nconstant source of instructive amusement that would never lose its\r\ninterest. He would not be dependent every hour upon people and things\r\noutside of himself; because he would carry about with him inexhaustible\r\nsources of instruction and pleasure that would furnish him continual and\r\nhelpful diversion and save him from a thousand morbid tendencies that\r\nare always ready to seize upon an unemployed mind. There are many men\r\nand women in the insane asylum to-day for the simple reason that they\r\nhave not made intelligent use of the mental powers that nature has\r\nendowed them with.\r\n\r\nSermons are not always preached from pulpits. They are written in the\r\nrocks and on the flowers of the field and the trees of the forest.\r\n\r\nLet us then look a little at the underground foundation of all this\r\nbeautiful earth. And before attempting that, the question may arise in\r\nsome minds how we know what is so deep down under the surface.\r\nFortunately this is a question very easily answered. At some period\r\nafter the rocks were formed the crust of the earth was broken by\r\nvolcanic eruptions at various places and times, and turned up, as in the\r\nformation of mountains, so that the edges of the various stratifications\r\nof the rocks, from those near the surface down to the lowest rocks, are\r\nexposed to view. Another means of knowing what the various formations\r\nare has been by borings of deep wells. These borings, however, are only\r\nconfirmatory of what was well known before through the upheavals that\r\nare plentiful in all parts of the world. There is abundant evidence that\r\nall of the rocks and all of the strata of every name and nature (except\r\nperhaps igneous rocks) were originally laid down in water. This is\r\nevidenced not only by the stratifications themselves, but by the\r\nevidences of sea-life everywhere present in the earth's crust. Before\r\nthe upheavals in the earth's crust began, the whole surface of the globe\r\nwas a great ocean of hot water. The substances of which the rocks were\r\nformed were undoubtedly held in suspension in the air and in the water,\r\nand by a gradual process were deposited in the bottom of the ocean in\r\nlayers, forming rocks of various kinds, according to the nature of the\r\nsubstance deposited. Gradually the crust of the earth was built up until\r\nit acquired a certain thickness; when, either from shrinkage under the\r\ncrust a great void was formed until it could not sustain its own weight,\r\nor the pressure caused by confined gases and molten matter produced an\r\nupheaval which broke the crust of the earth outward, causing great\r\nwrinkles that we call mountain ranges. Undoubtedly both forces were\r\nactive in producing these results. When the gases and molten matter had\r\nescaped through the rifts in the rocks caused by the upheaval there must\r\nhave been great voids formed that were filled up by the shrinkage of the\r\nearth, causing much irregularity in its surface.\r\n\r\nIn some places there were enormous elevations, and in others\r\ncorrespondingly deep depressions. The water that before was evenly\r\ndistributed over the surface of the globe, after the upheavals ran off\r\ninto the lower levels, filling up the great valleys, forming the seas,\r\nand leaving about one-third of the land surface uncovered. It must not\r\nbe supposed, however, that the appearance of the land was caused by one\r\ngrand movement or upheaval, but that it has been going on in successive\r\nstages through long ages of time. This is clearly evidenced by the rock\r\nformations. The deposition of rock strata is still active in the bottoms\r\nof the oceans, although not to the same degree as in former times. When\r\nthe upheaval took place the old stratifications were thrown out of\r\nlevel, but the new ones that were then formed remained in a level\r\nposition until they were in their turn disturbed by some subsequent\r\nupheaval.\r\n\r\nThe laws of gravitation would tend to precipitate the matter held in\r\nsuspension by the water straight down to the bottom, toward the center\r\nof the earth, so that the plane of these stratifications would tend to\r\nbe parallel to the surface of the water, that is horizontal, until\r\ndisturbed. Then they would be tilted in many directions. Hence it will\r\nbe easily seen why the seams in the rocks, especially in and near\r\nmountainous regions, do not lie in a horizontal position after an\r\nupheaval, but are found standing at all angles, up to a perpendicular.\r\n\r\nViewed from this standpoint, the solid portion of the old world has gone\r\nall to pieces. Wherever there is a chain of mountains it marks a\r\nbreakage in the earth's crust, and these mountains are not all on the\r\nland, but extend under the seas so deeply that they are unable to lift\r\ntheir heads above the surface of the water. The earth is no longer\r\nround, except in general outline, but broken up into all sorts of\r\nshapes that give the varied conditions of landscape that we find\r\nwhichever way we turn.\r\n\r\nThere are but few volcanoes that are active in this age, while in former\r\ntimes they extended for thousands of miles. We still have occasional\r\nearthquakes, but undoubtedly they are very slight as compared with those\r\nthat shook the earth millions of years ago.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we study the constitution of the earth's crust so far as it has\r\nyet been penetrated, we find it divided up into periods called Primary,\r\nSecondary, and Tertiary. The primary period reaches down to the line\r\nwhere the lowest forms of animal fossils begin to be found. This is\r\ncalled the \"Paleozoic\" period, which means the period of \"ancient life.\"\r\nFrom here let us first go downward. Immediately under this lies a\r\nstratum of \"Metamorphic\" rocks. To metamorphose is to change; and\r\nmetamorphic rocks are those which have been changed by heat or pressure\r\nfrom their original formation. This class of rocks lie on top of what\r\nare called \"Igneous\" rocks, which means that they have been formed by or\r\nsubjected to heat. All lava-formed rocks are igneous. They are\r\nunstratified,--not in layers or strata, but in a formless mass,--and in\r\nthis they differ from water-formed rocks.\r\n\r\nIf there is a molten center to the earth these igneous rocks are\r\nundoubtedly the offspring of this great internal furnace. The\r\nmetamorphic rocks were primarily igneous and are changed somewhat in\r\ntheir structure by the lapse of time. For instance, marble is a\r\nmetamorphic limestone. The difference between common limestone and\r\nmarble is in its molecular structure--the way in which its smallest\r\nparticles are put together. They are both carbonates of lime. But the\r\nmarble is made up of little crystals and will take a polish, while\r\nordinary uncrystallized limestone will not. The igneous rocks are\r\nchiefly granite; and granite is formed of orthoclase-feldspar, mica, and\r\nquartz. (The word \"orthoclase\" means straight fracture, and the\r\northoclase-feldspar has two lines of cleavage at right angles to each\r\nother.) This is the ordinary composition of granite, but there are a\r\ngreat many variations, chiefly as to color and proportions of the\r\ningredients named.\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks, then, are the lowest of all; then come the\r\nmetamorphic rocks; and as before stated, on top of metamorphic rock\r\nbegins the first evidence of life in its lowest form. The Paleozoic\r\n(ancient life) or Primary period is made up of a number of subdivisions.\r\nThe first and oldest division is called the \"Silurian\" age, which is\r\nunderlaid by the metamorphic rocks and overlaid by the rocks of the\r\nDevonian period. It is called Silurian, from the name of a kind of fish,\r\nfossils of which are found in the rocks of this age, which are\r\ndistinguished for the absence of land-plant fossils and vertebrate\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIn the Silurian strata are found limestones, slate, flagstones, shales,\r\netc. On top of the Silurian begins the \"Devonian\" age, in which is found\r\nthe old red sandstone, as well as limestone and slate; and here begin to\r\nbe found the fossils of land-plants. On top of the Devonian lies the\r\n\"Carboniferous\" series, which complete the series of the primary period.\r\nIn the lower part of this stratum is found carboniferous limestone,\r\nwhich is overlaid by a kind of stone called millstone grit, and on top\r\nof this lie the true carboniferous strata or coal-bearing measures. In\r\nthe coal strata are found the first reptile fossils.\r\n\r\nOn top of the coal measures begins the Secondary period, or \"Mesozoic\"\r\n(middle life). This period is distinguished for the great development of\r\nreptiles, and is called the \"age of reptiles.\" In this age occur the\r\nfirst traces of mammals, and birds, and fishes with bony skeletons.\r\nAmong plants we find here the first evidence of palms. The formation is\r\nchiefly chalk, sandstones, clays, limestone, etc. We now come to the\r\nlast or \"Tertiary\" period, which brings us to the top earth. This is\r\nchiefly formed of sedimentary rocks--those which have been formed by\r\nthe settling of sediment, in water.\r\n\r\nWhile we are forced to these general conclusions in regard to the\r\nbuilding of the world, and to its subsequent distortion by the series of\r\nupheavals that have occurred from time to time, and to the successive\r\n\"ages\" of the layers of rock foundation of its crust, there are many\r\nmysteries that remain unsolved and many questions will present\r\nthemselves to the mind of the reader. One of these questions is, Where\r\nwas the water and where was the earthy matter before its precipitation?\r\nMatter, including water, can exist in the gaseous form, and we only need\r\nto assume that there was a core of intense heat, to understand how all\r\nthe material that we find on the earth and in the earth could have been\r\nheld in suspension in the gaseous state until the cooling process had\r\nreached a stage where the various combinations and recombinations could\r\ntake place in the great laboratory of nature. If we study the\r\nconstitution of the sun (and with the modern appliances we are able to\r\ndo so), we find that it is made up of some and perhaps all of the same\r\nmaterials that are found here on earth. If there is no water existing,\r\nin the sun, as water, there are the gases present which would produce it\r\nif the conditions were right. And, for all we know, that flaming mass of\r\nburning gases may some time go through the same kind of cooling and\r\nbuilding up in solids that our earth has experienced.\r\n\r\nWe thus have what may be called an outline sketch of the process of\r\nWorld-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLIMESTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA large part of the structure of the earth's crust is formed of a\r\nsubstance called limestone. Ordinary limestone is a compound of common\r\nlime and carbon dioxide, a gas that is found mixed with the air to a\r\nvery small degree. Carbon dioxide will be better known by the older\r\npeople as carbonic acid. It is a gas that is given off whenever wood and\r\ncoal are burned, or any substance containing carbon. It is composed of\r\none atom of carbon to two of oxygen. Every ton of coal that is burned\r\nsends off three and two-thirds tons of this gas. The increase in weight\r\ncomes from the fact that every atom of carbon unites with two of oxygen,\r\nwhich it takes from the air, and the oxygen is heavier than the carbon.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the relative weights of atoms (the smallest combinable\r\nparticle of a solid, liquid, or gas) we use the hydrogen atom as the\r\nunit of comparison and call it \"one,\" because it is the lightest of all\r\natoms. The carbon atom is twelve times heavier than the hydrogen atom,\r\nand the oxygen atom is sixteen times heavier. Hence it will be seen\r\nreadily how a ton of coal will form two and two-thirds times its weight\r\nof carbonic dioxide. Lime, having a strong affinity or attraction for\r\nthis gas, has absorbed it from the air and water, forming what is known\r\nas carbonate of lime--which is the ordinary limestone. Chalk and the\r\nvarious marbles are also carbonates of lime. Limestone strata in the\r\ncrust of the earth are found in all the periods of the earth's\r\nformation. All forms of sea shells that were once the homes of animal\r\nlife are constructed of this compound; and in the later formations of\r\nlimestone, in the Secondary and Tertiary periods, we find this rock to\r\nbe made up almost entirely of marine shells, some of them microscopic in\r\nsize. The earlier or older formations of limestone that are found deeper\r\ndown in the earth's crust are less mingled with these marine shells.\r\nThis comes from the fact that the first deposition of limestone strata\r\noccurred before the later forms of sea life had developed. Whatever\r\nsigns of life are found in these lower stratifications are of the very\r\nlowest order. It is not to be understood that animal life is a necessary\r\nfactor in the formation of limestone, but it has been an incidental\r\nfeature which no doubt has been the chief means of gathering up from the\r\nwater this compound and precipitating it into the great limestone\r\nstrata that are everywhere found.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime is found in solution in nearly, if not quite, all of\r\nthe mineral waters, and is also found in the water of the ocean. In\r\nearlier times it must have been held in solution in much greater\r\nquantities than at present. The myriads of sea animals that existed, and\r\nthat still exist, gathered from the water this substance, which formed\r\ntheir shells, and served as a house in which they lived. New germs were\r\ncontinually forming new shells, while the older ones ceased to live as\r\nanimals, and their houses in which they lived were precipitated to the\r\nbottom of the ocean, where they were bound together as limestone rock.\r\nThese sea animals no doubt caused a much more rapid formation of\r\nlimestone than would or could have been the case without their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nOne can thus readily see what an important factor animal life has been\r\nin the process of world-building. This process is still going on, but\r\nprobably not to the same extent as in former ages, because it is not\r\nlikely that there is so much carbonate of lime held in solution as there\r\nwas before these great limestone beds were formed. Limestone, however,\r\nis easily disintegrated by the action of water. We find the spring water\r\nimpregnated with it as well as that of the small streams and rivers.\r\nPure water is a powerful solvent. When the rains fall upon the earth the\r\nwater percolates through it and through the limestone strata, which\r\ngradually wears away the limestone and carries it back to the ocean, so\r\nthat the process of tearing down and building up is continually going\r\non. The great caves that are found everywhere in the limestone regions\r\nwere formed by the action of water. The great Mammoth Cave of Kentucky,\r\nwhich is said to have 200 miles of underground passages, has been\r\nentirely worn out by the action of running water.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the writer visited this cave and had an opportunity to\r\nstudy the wonderful eroding or gnawing-out effect of water on limestone.\r\nAt some period earlier in the history of the earth there was evidently\r\nan underground river or large stream of water that found its way through\r\nthe crevices of the rocks, and gradually wore out a great bed for\r\nitself, which was fed by lateral streams pouring into the main branch,\r\neach one of which lateral branches cut its own channel. A plan view of\r\nthe Mammoth Cave presents a picture not unlike that of a great river\r\nwith numerous branches emptying into it, all of them showing the\r\nwindings such as we see in a river and its feeders upon the surface of\r\nthe earth. There are three sets of these channels, one above the other,\r\nand we do not find the water till we get to the bottom of the third\r\nunderground story, so to speak. There is one place in this system of\r\nunderground channels where the dripping from the roof of the upper\r\nchannels has cut a great well hole many feet in diameter perpendicularly\r\ndown through the whole system to a great depth. The sides of this great\r\nwell hole are fluted into grooves caused by the constant downflow of the\r\nwater. Although the amount of water flowing down through this well hole\r\nis very small, it is continually at work. Like interest on money, it\r\nnever rests, each minute that passes has eaten away some of the great\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nIn other portions of the cave the dripping of the water is so gradual\r\nthat the carbonate of lime hardens and forms what are called\r\nstalactites, that hang like icicles from the roof of the cave. Sometimes\r\nthe water runs down so slowly upon these stalactites that it evaporates\r\nas fast as it appears, leaving behind its little load of carbonate of\r\nlime. If, however, there is a drip, there are formations built also from\r\nthe lime in the dropping water on the floor of the cave, and these are\r\ncalled stalagmites. In time the stalactites and the stalagmites will\r\nmeet, forming a great column reaching from floor to ceiling. Some of\r\nthese formations, when they are free from foreign substances, are very\r\nbeautiful. They are also very hard, giving off a metallic musical tone\r\nwhen struck by any hard substance.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that limestone is a compound of ordinary lime and\r\ncarbon dioxide, forming a carbonate of lime. This statement does not\r\ngive a complete analysis of all the elements entering into limestone. In\r\nthe first place lime itself is a compound formed of two elementary\r\nsubstances, calcium and oxygen. The lime molecule is composed of one\r\natom of calcium and one of oxygen. Neither calcium nor lime is found\r\npure in nature. Inasmuch as carbon dioxide is composed of one atom of\r\ncarbon and two of oxygen, and lime is composed of one atom of calcium\r\nand one of oxygen, when we have the two combined the molecule of\r\ncarbonate of lime, or, as it is technically called, calcic carbonate, is\r\ncomposed of one atom of calcium, one of carbon and three of oxygen,\r\n(lime plus carbon dioxide).\r\n\r\nAs before stated, lime is not found un-combined with other substances in\r\nnature. And as it is of great economic importance, it will be profitable\r\nto know how it is formed. Lime is produced from ordinary limestone by\r\nburning it in kilns where it is subjected to a heat of a certain\r\ntemperature for a number of hours. The heat drives off the carbon\r\ndioxide, which, as we have seen, has taken away from each molecule of\r\nthe compound all of the carbon and two atoms of the oxygen, while all\r\nof the calcium is retained with one atom of oxygen, leaving ordinary\r\nlime. Lime, then, is simply oxide of calcium.\r\n\r\nAs all know, it is used almost exclusively for making mortar for\r\nbuilding purposes. In order to do this we have to put it through the\r\nprocess of \"slacking,\" by pouring water upon it, and here another\r\nchemical change takes place. The water unites with the lime, when\r\nimmediately the heat that was expended in throwing off the carbon\r\ndioxide and was stored in the lime as energy is now given up again in\r\nthe form of heat. When a considerable bulk of lime is slacked very\r\nrapidly the heat that is given off is so great that it will produce\r\ncombustion. Here is a beautiful illustration of what has been\r\nerroneously called \"latent heat.\" It is \"heat stored as potential\r\nenergy,\" that is released by the combination of lime with water.\r\nSlackened lime, then, is called calcic hydrate.\r\n\r\nVery little of the limestone that we find is absolutely pure. It is\r\nconsidered good when it does not contain over five or six per cent. of\r\nforeign substance. When more than this is present the lime is considered\r\npoor, and when it reaches fifteen per cent. or more of impurities it\r\nassumes the property of hardening under water and is called cement.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime is found in several other forms; for instance, the\r\nvarious kinds of marble and chalk are carbonates of lime. The\r\ncomposition of marble and chalk is exactly the same as that of\r\nlimestone. The difference is chiefly one of molecular rather than\r\nchemical structure. Marble is what chemists would call an allotropic or\r\nchanged form of limestone; and, as before stated, the difference seems\r\nto consist in the fact that the marble assumes a crystalline arrangement\r\nof its atoms and will therefore take a high polish, which is not true of\r\nordinary limestone. Marble varies greatly in coloring and texture, all\r\nof which differences are explainable under the one head of molecular\r\narrangement. Nearly pure carbon exists in three distinct forms--the\r\ndiamond, graphite, and charcoal. As is the case with marble, these\r\ndifferences in the different forms of carbon are not chemical, but\r\nmolecular differences. The substances are the same, but their\r\ninfinitesimal particles are differently arranged.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime--as it exists in its various forms, as limestone, from\r\nwhich lime and cement are made, and marble, which is such an important\r\nelement in the arts--is a substance of great importance to man. We have\r\nalready noted some of the processes that nature uses in gathering up\r\nthese substances from the ocean by the employment of various forms of\r\nanimal life. Here is another. Whoever has visited the Bermudas has seen\r\nan island wholly formed of what is called coral rock. Coral is a\r\nstructure produced by a peculiar form of sea animal that gathers up the\r\ncalcareous or lime-like matter floating in the sea water, and builds a\r\nhouse of it in which to live during the little lifetime that is allotted\r\nto him. When he dies his children do not occupy the old home, but build\r\na new one, which is a superstructure planted upon the old one as a\r\nfoundation. This process of growth sometimes takes the form of a tree or\r\nplant, and coral trees grow upon trees and plants upon plants, until a\r\nstructure is erected having its foundation upon the bottom of the ocean,\r\nthat finally reaches up until it rises above the surface of the water;\r\nand here--after through years the water has brought sea-weed and drift\r\nto decay and form soil, and the birds have brought seeds and\r\nfertilization, and vegetable life is prospering--another animal called\r\nman builds his home upon it. The material that the coral is formed of is\r\nsubstantially the same as that we find in the minute shells of the\r\nlimestone rocks.\r\n\r\nThe great chalk cliffs that are found on the coasts of the English\r\nchannel are the work of a sea animal microscopic in size. At one time it\r\nwas a question among scientists how these chalk cliffs were formed, but\r\nwhen the microscope was invented this mystery, as well as many others,\r\nwas solved. The chemical components of chalk are precisely the same as\r\nthose of limestone. The microscope shows that chalk is almost wholly a\r\nproduct of very small organized shells. The animals who are the\r\narchitects of the chalk cliffs are called \"foraminifera\"--bearing shells\r\nperforated with little holes. The chief difference between chalk and\r\nlimestone seems to be in the size of the shells of which they are\r\nrespectively made up and in the manner of the bonding of these shells\r\ntogether. The shells in a lump of chalk are held much more loosely than\r\nthose in a lump of limestone. These intrepid workers are still actively\r\nchanging the structure of the bottoms of seas and oceans, and forming\r\nnew islands, which in turn become the substructure that supports new\r\nlife, animal and vegetable. And when we consider the great part\r\nperformed by these microscopic architects and builders it is not a\r\nmisnomer to speak of the building of a world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCOAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time, long ago, some man made the discovery that what we now call\r\ncoal would burn and produce light and warmth. Who he was or how long ago\r\nhe lived we do not know, but as all earthly things have a beginning, we\r\nknow that such a man did live and that the discovery that coal would\r\nburn was made. Coal, in the sense that we use the word here, is not\r\nmentioned in the Scriptures. According to some authorities, coal was\r\nused in England as early as the ninth century. It is recorded that in\r\n1259 King Henry III. granted a privilege to certain parties to mine coal\r\nat Newcastle. It is further stated that seven years after this time coal\r\nbecame an article of export. In 1306 coal was so generally used in\r\nLondon that a petition was sent to parliament to have the use of it\r\nsuppressed on the ground that it was a nuisance. Coal was used in\r\nBelgium, however, about 1200. There is a tradition that a blacksmith\r\nfirst used it in Liege as fuel. It was first used for manufacturing\r\npurposes about 1713.\r\n\r\nCoal is found laid down in great veins, varying in thickness, in various\r\nparts of the world in the upper strata of the Paleozoic period. The age\r\nin which it was formed is called by geologists the Carboniferous\r\n(coal-bearing) age.\r\n\r\nBefore going on to account for the deposits of coal, let us stop a\r\nmoment and consider what it is. Chemists tell us that coal is chiefly\r\nconstructed of carbon, compounded with oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.\r\nThere are many varieties, but all may be classified under two general\r\nheadings--bituminous and anthracite. Bituminous coal contains a large\r\namount of a tarry substance, a kind of mineral pitch or bitumen, which\r\nburns with a brilliant flame and a black sooty smoke, exceedingly rich\r\nin carbon. Anthracite coal is hard and stone-like in its texture,\r\nburning with scarcely any flame and no smoke. It produces a fire of\r\nintense heat when it is once ignited. There is another form of coal\r\ncalled cannel coal, which is a corruption of \"candle coal,\" so called\r\nbecause a piece of this kind of coal when ignited will burn like a match\r\nor pine knot and give light like a candle. This is the richest of all\r\nthe coal deposits in gases that are set free by heat, and for this\r\nreason is extensively used in the manufacture of what is commonly\r\ncalled coal gas. England produces a large amount of cannel coal, as well\r\nas another variety of bituminous coal, which latter, however, does not\r\nburn with such a black smoke as the coal found in the Ohio valley and\r\nthe Western States of America. East of the Alleghany Mountains there is\r\na region of anthracite coal that is very extensively worked and finds\r\ngreat favor in all parts of the country as fuel for domestic heating,\r\nespecially on account of its great cleanliness.\r\n\r\nAll of the coal beds have a common origin, and the difference in the\r\nquality of coal found in different parts of the country is due to many\r\ncircumstances, some of which have never been explained. There is\r\nindisputable proof, however, that all coal beds are of vegetable origin.\r\nGeologists tell us that these coal beds were formed during an age before\r\nthe earth had cooled down to the temperature that it has at the present\r\ntime--an age when vegetation was forced by the internal heat of the\r\nearth instead of having to receive all its warmth from the sun's rays as\r\nwe do now. Some of our readers are familiar with what is commonly termed\r\na hotbed. A hotbed is made by putting soil on top of substances that\r\nwill ferment and create heat underneath the soil. This heat from beneath\r\nwill force vegetation and cause a much larger growth than there will be\r\nif left to the sun's rays alone. During the carboniferous age the earth\r\nwas a great hotbed.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of trees and plants, as well as reptiles, that we find in\r\nthe great coal measures of the world, show that they were of large\r\ntropical growth, and this is shown not only in the temperate zone, but\r\nin the zone farther north. For ages and ages this rank growth of\r\nvegetation grew up and fell down until a great layer of vegetable matter\r\nwas formed, which at a later time was covered over by other\r\nstratifications of earth material, so that these great layers of\r\nvegetable formation were hermetically sealed and pressed down by an\r\nenormous weight that increased as time went on. The formation of coal\r\nmay be studied even at this day (for it is now going on) by visiting and\r\nexamining the great peat beds that are found in various parts of the\r\nworld. It is well known that peat is used as a fuel by many people,\r\nespecially the peasantry of the old countries. If peat is pressed to a\r\nsufficient degree of hardness it burns in a manner not unlike some forms\r\nof coal. Peat is a vegetable formation and has been formed by the rank\r\ngrowth of various kinds of vegetation in swampy places. Of course, it\r\nlacks the purity of the coal that was formed during the carboniferous\r\nage, because of the much slower growth of vegetation now than during\r\nthat time, and the opportunity that peat bogs offer for an intermixture\r\nof earthy with the vegetable matter. The fact that we find the imprint\r\nof trees and ferns and other vegetable growth of tropical varieties, as\r\nwell as the fossils of reptiles, imbedded in the coal measures, proves\r\nthat at one time this stratum was at the land surface of the earth. We\r\nalso find that all of the formations of the Secondary and Tertiary\r\nperiods are on top of the coal--and this shows that after the age of\r\nrank vegetable growth there was a sinking of the earth in many places\r\nfar down into the ocean--so that vast layers of rock formed on top of\r\nthese beds of vegetable matter. In England great chalk beds crop out in\r\ncliffs on the southern coast, and, as we have seen, these chalk rocks\r\nare largely made up of the shells of marine animals. London stands on a\r\nchalk bed, from six hundred to eight hundred feet thick. Indeed, England\r\nhas been poetically called Albion, White-land, from this appearance of\r\nher coast.\r\n\r\nAll of the great chalk beds were formed ages after the coal beds, as the\r\nlatter are found in the upper strata of the Paleozoic period.\r\n\r\nA study of these strata will show that there are many layers of coal\r\nstrata varying in thickness and separated by layers of shale and\r\nsandstone. How the shale and sandstone layers are formed will be the\r\nsubject of a future chapter.\r\n\r\nFrom the position that the coal measures occupy, being entirely under\r\nthe Secondary and Tertiary formations, it will be observed that they are\r\nvery old. If we should examine a piece of ordinary bituminous coal we\r\nshould find that there are lines of cleavage in it parallel to each\r\nother, and that it is an easy matter to separate the lump on these\r\nlines. If we examine the outcrop of a coal bed we will find that these\r\nlines of cleavage are horizontal. This indicates that the great bulk of\r\nvegetable matter of which the coal formation is made up has been\r\nsubjected to tremendous pressure during a long period of time. If we\r\nfurther examine the structure of a body of coal we find the impressions\r\nof limbs and branches as well as the leaves of trees and various kinds\r\nof plants. We shall further find that these impressions lie in a plant\r\nin the same direction as the line of cleavage. This is a point to be\r\nremembered, as it helps to explain the nature and structure of other\r\nformations than those of coal. Not only are leaves and branches of\r\nvegetable matter found, but fossils of reptiles, such as live on the\r\nland. Sometimes there is found the fossil of a great tree trunk standing\r\nin an erect position, with its roots running down into the rock below\r\nthe coal bed, while the trunk extends upward entirely through the coal\r\nand high up into the other strata. All of these facts lead us to the\r\nfirm conclusion that when the trees were grown that formed these beds\r\nthey were above the surface of the ocean. This, taken in connection with\r\nthe fact that the vegetable fossils that are found indicate a tropical\r\ngrowth of great size, drives us to the conclusion that the climate at\r\nthe time these coal measures were formed was much warmer than it is now.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, this extra warmth came from the earth itself before\r\nit had cooled down to its present temperature, rather than from the heat\r\nof the sun. There is nothing inconsistent in the thought that the sun\r\nmay have been warmer in a former age than now. We may conceive that the\r\nearliest coal formations took place when the land stood above the\r\nsurface of the water, and that the conditions were favorable for a rapid\r\nand luxuriant growth of vegetation; after this had gone on for a very\r\nlong period of time, by some convulsion of nature the land surface was\r\nsubmerged under the ocean, when other mineral substances were deposited\r\non top of this layer of vegetable growth, which hardened into a rock\r\nformation. At a later period the earth was again elevated above the\r\nsurface of the water and the same process of growth and decay was\r\nrepeated. These oscillations of the earth up and down occurred at\r\nenormously long intervals, until all of the various coal strata with\r\ntheir intermediate formations were completed. After this we must suppose\r\nthat the whole was submerged to a great depth and for a very long period\r\nof time, because of the great number and various kinds of rock\r\nformations laid down by water that lie on top of the coal measures. This\r\ntremendous weight, as it was gradually builded up, subjected these\r\nvegetable strata to an inconceivable pressure. In some places this\r\npressure was much greater than in others, which undoubtedly is one of\r\nthe reasons why we find such differences in the structure and quality of\r\ncoal. There were no doubt many other reasons for differences, one of\r\nthem being the character of the vegetable growth out of which they were\r\nformed. Again, in some parts of the world these coal strata may have\r\nbeen subjected to a considerable degree of heat, which would change the\r\nstructure of the formation, and in some cases drive off the volatile\r\ngases. One can easily imagine that heat was thus a factor in the\r\nformation of what is known as anthracite coal, so much less gaseous than\r\nthe bituminous kinds. The anthracite beds seem to be denser and of a\r\nmore homogeneous character. The lines of cleavage are not as prominent,\r\nbut there are the same evidences of vegetable origin that we find in the\r\nbituminous formations.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from what has gone before that coal was first wood. But\r\nwood is a product of sunshine. Thus the sun was the architect and\r\nbuilder of the trees and plants that were finally hermetically sealed\r\nunder the great earth strata. The sun gathered up the material and set\r\nthe forces in play which made the chemical combinations of the various\r\nelements in nature that enter into vegetable growth.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of untold ages of time these great beds of stored-up\r\nsun-energy were discovered by man and their contents are dragged out to\r\nthe earth's surface, to warm our houses, to drive the machinery of our\r\nfactories, to send the locomotives flying across the continents and the\r\nsteamships over the oceans. So important has this article become that if\r\nany one nation could control the output it would be able to paralyze all\r\nthe navies and the manufacturing of the world.\r\n\r\nIf the coal of the world should become exhausted we should be confronted\r\nwith a great problem. Fortunately for us, this is a problem that will\r\nhave to be solved by the people of some future age, as the growth of\r\nwood will scarcely keep pace with the consumption of fuel. By that time\r\nthe genius of man will have devised an economical means of storing the\r\nenergy of the sunbeams directly for purposes of heat, light, and power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSLATE AND SHALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlate is one of the great commercial products of the world. As far back\r\nas the year 1877 the output of slate was not less than 1,000,000 tons\r\nper annum. The chief use to which slate is put is for covering\r\nbuildings, and for this purpose it is better than any other known\r\nmaterial. It is also used in the construction of billiard tables and for\r\nwriting-slates; these latter uses are very insignificant as compared to\r\nits use in architecture. Slate, like building-stone and limestone, is\r\nquarried from the earth's crust and is found in the strata close above\r\nthe Metamorphic rocks, near the beginning of what is called the Primary,\r\nor Paleozoic period. As compared with the coal formations it is very,\r\nvery old.\r\n\r\nThere are different substances called slate that are not slate in the\r\nscientific use of that word. In general all stone formations are called\r\nslates that split up into thin layers. But the true slate is a special\r\nmaterial which is formed by special processes of nature. The difference\r\nbetween slate and shale, for instance, is not one of ingredients, but of\r\nthe process by which the ingredients are put together. All of the\r\nsedimentary rocks are formed by a deposit of sediment from the water on\r\nthe bottom of the ocean. At one period the floods have brought down a\r\ncertain kind of material in greater profusion than at others, and this\r\nis deposited in thin layers, and as it hardens there will be seams in it\r\nand the stratifications will be differently colored, the color depending\r\nupon the deposit at any particular time.\r\n\r\nA bed of shale, like a bed of coal, has lines of cleavage in it, and if\r\nit is examined under a microscope it will be found that the sedimentary\r\nparticles, like the twigs and leaves in the coal veins, lie with their\r\nlongest dimensions in line with the plane of cleavage. Shale in color\r\nlooks like slate, and an analysis of the material of which it is formed\r\nshows that shale and slate are both made from the same. There is,\r\nhowever, a structural difference between the two which is very peculiar\r\nand very interesting. The slate is ordinarily a denser material and the\r\nlines of cleavage are often at right angles with those that we find in\r\nordinary shale.\r\n\r\nA slab of shale will be of a uniform color on any one line of cleavage.\r\nThe color may change at the next line, and generally does, to a slight\r\nextent. It is easy to see, then, if we could change the lines of\r\ncleavage in the shale, so as to run at right angles with their present\r\nlines, the face of a slab would show bands of different colors or\r\nshadings, such as we often see in slate. If you take a piece of clay\r\nthat has been thoroughly mixed, and subject it to a very great pressure,\r\nand then examine the piece that has been submitted to pressure under a\r\nmicroscope and compare it with a piece of the clay after it has been\r\nthoroughly mixed, but has not been submitted to pressure, you will find\r\nthat the two are very different in structure. The pressed clay will show\r\nthat the particles of which it is made up have all turned, so that their\r\nlongest dimensions are in a line at right angles with the direction of\r\npressure. Here is an interesting fact that we must remember. And it is\r\nin this that we find the reason for the structural difference between\r\nshale and slate. The lines of cleavage in shale are not formed\r\nnecessarily by pressure, but because in the disposition of the material\r\nof which it was formed the particles naturally laid themselves down so\r\nthat their longest dimensions were on a horizontal line.\r\n\r\nAges after, when other rock and other formations had been laid down on\r\ntop of the bed of deposited mud, the upheavals of the earth have so\r\nchanged the lines of pressure upon this material and the pressure is so\r\ngreat that a rearrangement of the particles of which the slate is made\r\nup has taken place, so that their longest dimensions now are in a\r\ndirection that crosses the stratifications as originally laid down.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is twofold. First, the material is compressed into a\r\ndenser, closer form, and then, the lines of cleavage are changed, or to\r\nexpress it in more common language, the grain has been changed. So that\r\nwhen it splits up it runs crosswise of the original layers as the water\r\ndeposited them, and this produces the different shadings so often seen\r\nin different slate. Shale splits in line with its layers; slate splits\r\nacross that line.\r\n\r\nLet us go back a moment to our experiment with the lump of clay. If we\r\nexamined the mixture before submitted to pressure we should find that\r\nthe oblong particles of which it was made up would stand in all\r\ndirections, hit or miss, and if we should dry this lump of clay it would\r\nhave no special lines of cleavage. But the moment we have submitted it\r\nto a certain amount of pressure we find that lines of cleavage have been\r\nestablished, and that the particles have been rearranged so that their\r\nlongest dimensions are all in one direction, which coincides with the\r\ncleavage lines. If we should now take this same piece of clay and\r\nsubject it to a pressure at right angles to that of the first\r\nexperiment we should find that the lines of cleavage had also changed\r\nand that the particles had all been rearranged. Apply the principle to\r\nthe formation of slate, and we can understand how it happens that what\r\nwe call the grain runs crosswise of the deposits that were made at\r\ndifferent times. It is not a chemical, but purely a mechanical\r\ndifference. Or, to express it differently--the difference is a\r\nstructural one produced by mechanical causes.\r\n\r\nThe origin of cleavage in slate has been the subject of much speculation\r\nand investigation, but like many other problems it was solved through\r\nthe invention and application of the microscope. Thin layers of slate\r\nhave been made, the same as with limestone and chalk, so thin that the\r\nlight would readily pass through it and that an examination of the\r\nparticles could be readily made, showing their arrangement under varied\r\nconditions. Science is indebted to the microscope for the solution of\r\nvery many problems that for ages before had puzzled philosophers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSALT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may seem curious to the reader that we should care to discuss a\r\nsubject seemingly so simple as common salt. But it is a very usual thing\r\nfor us to live and move in the presence of things that are very common\r\nto our everyday experience, and yet know scarcely anything about them,\r\nbeyond the fact that they in some way serve our purpose.\r\n\r\nSalt is one of the commonest articles used in the preparation of our\r\nfood. It has been questioned by some people whether salt was a real\r\nnecessity as an animal food, or whether the taste for it is merely an\r\nacquired one. All peoples in all ages seem to have used salt, and\r\nreference to it is made in the earliest histories. Travelers tell us\r\nthat savage tribes, wherever they exist, are as much addicted to the use\r\nof salt as civilized people. One of the early African travelers, Mungo\r\nPark, tells us that the children of central Africa will suck a piece of\r\nrock salt with the same avidity and seeming satisfaction as the\r\nordinary civilized child will a lump of sugar.\r\n\r\nAll animals seem to require salt, and it is claimed by those who have\r\ntried the experiment that after one has refrained from the use of salt\r\nfor a certain length of time the craving for it becomes exceedingly\r\npainful. It is most likely that the taste for salt is a natural craving.\r\nIn any event, whether it is a natural or an artificial taste, it has\r\nbecome an article of the greatest importance in the preparation of food,\r\nas well as on account of its use in the arts. Salt is a compound of\r\nchlorine and sodium. In chemical language it is called sodium chloride.\r\nThe symbol is NaCl, which means that a molecule of salt is composed of\r\none atom of sodium and one of chlorine. Chlorine is an exceedingly\r\npoisonous gas.\r\n\r\nFormerly the chemist when he wished to obtain sodium extracted it from\r\ncommon salt and discharged the chlorine gas into the air. It was found\r\nthat in establishments where the manufacture of sodium was conducted on\r\na large scale the destructive properties of the chlorine discharged into\r\nthe air was such that all vegetation was killed for some distance around\r\nthe manufactory. This came to be such a nuisance that the manufacturers\r\nwere either compelled to stop business or in some way take care of the\r\nchlorine. This is done at the present day by uniting the chlorine gas\r\nwith common lime, forming a chloride of lime, which is used for\r\nbleaching and purifying purposes.\r\n\r\nSalt is found in great quantities as a natural product under the name of\r\nrock salt. It is found in some parts of the world in great veins over\r\n100 feet in thickness. In some cases the rock salt is mined, when it has\r\nto be purified for commercial purposes. The common mode of obtaining\r\nsalt, however, is by pumping the solution from these great beds where it\r\nis mingled with water--salt water; the water is then evaporated, and\r\nwhen it reaches a certain stage of evaporation the salt crystallizes and\r\nfalls to the bottom.\r\n\r\nDifferent substances crystallize in different forms. The crystallization\r\nof water when it freezes, as we shall see hereafter, arranges its\r\nmolecules in such a form as to make a lump of ice of given dimensions\r\nlighter than the same dimensions of water would be. Salt in\r\ncrystallizing does not follow the same law; the salt crystal is in the\r\nshape of a cube and is denser in its crystalline form than in solution,\r\nhence it is heavier and falls to the bottom.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there is a deposit of rock salt in Galicia, Austria,\r\ncovering an area of 10,000 square miles. There are also very large\r\ndeposits in England, the mining of which has become a great industry.\r\nThere are also great beds of salt in various parts of the United\r\nStates, notably near Syracuse, N. Y., where large salt deposits were\r\nexposed in an old river bed formed in preglacial times. The common mode\r\nof preparing salt for domestic purposes is by the process of evaporation\r\nfrom brine that has been pumped from salt wells. The quality of the salt\r\nis determined largely by the temperature at the time of evaporating the\r\nwater from it. Ordinary coarse salt, such as is used for preserving meat\r\nor fish, is made at a temperature of about 110 degrees; what is known as\r\ncommon salt is made at a temperature of about 175 degrees; while common\r\nfine or table salt is made at a temperature of 220 degrees. Thus it will\r\nbe seen that the process of granulation with reference to its fineness\r\nis determined by the rapidity of evaporation. Salt is one of the\r\nprincipal agents in preserving all kinds of meats against putrefaction.\r\nIt will also preserve wood against dry rot. Vessel builders make use of\r\nthis fact to preserve the timbers used in the construction of the\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nSalt at the present day is very cheap, but at the beginning of the\r\npresent century it was worth from $60 to $70 per ton. The methods of\r\ndecomposing salt to obtain its constituents, which are used in various\r\nother compounds, are very simple to-day as compared with the processes\r\nthat prevailed in the days before the advent of electricity in large\r\nvolume, such as is produced by the power of Niagara Falls. It is curious\r\nto note that a substance so useful and so harmless as common salt should\r\nbe made out of two such refractory and dangerous elements as chlorine\r\nand sodium. Both of these elements, standing by themselves, seem to be\r\nout of harmony with nature, but when combined there are few substances\r\nthat serve a better purpose.\r\n\r\nThese great salt beds that are found to exist in England and America and\r\nother parts of the world were undoubtedly deposited from the water of\r\nthe ocean at some stage in the formation of the earth's crust. It is\r\nwell known that sea water is exceedingly saline; 300 gallons of sea\r\nwater will produce a bushel of salt. Undoubtedly beds of salt are also\r\nformed by inland lakes, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Only about\r\n2.7 per cent. of ocean water is salt, while the water of the Great Salt\r\nLake of Utah contains about 17 per cent. When there is so much salt in\r\nwater that it is called a saturated solution, salt crystals will form\r\nand drop to the bottom, which process will in time build up under a\r\nlarge body of salt water a great bed of rock salt.\r\n\r\nThe water in all rivers and springs contains salt to a certain degree,\r\nand where it runs into a basin like that of a lake with no outlet,\r\nthrough the process of evaporation pure water is being constantly\r\ncarried off, leaving the salt behind. It is easy to see that if this\r\nprocess is kept up long enough the water will become in time a saturated\r\nsolution, when crystallization sets in and precipitation follows,\r\naccounting for the deposits of rock salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteorology is a science that at one time included astronomy, but now it\r\nis restricted to the weather, seasons, and all phenomena that are\r\nmanifested in the atmosphere in its relation to heat, electricity, and\r\nmoisture, as well as the laws that govern the ever-varying conditions of\r\nthe circumambient air of our globe. The air is made up chiefly of oxygen\r\nand nitrogen, in the proportions of about twenty-one parts of oxygen and\r\nseventy-nine parts nitrogen by volume, and by weight about twenty-three\r\nparts oxygen and seventy-seven of nitrogen. These gases exist in the air\r\nas free gases and not chemically combined. The air is simply a mixture\r\nof these two gases.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between a mixture and a compound. In a mixture\r\nthere is no chemical change in the molecules of the substances mixed. In\r\na compound there has been a rearrangement of the atoms, new molecules\r\nare formed, and a new substance is the result.\r\n\r\nAbout 99-1/2 per cent. of air is oxygen and nitrogen and one-half per\r\ncent. is chiefly carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a product of\r\ncombustion, decay, and animal exhalation. It is poison to the animal,\r\nbut food for the vegetable. However, the proportion in the air is so\r\nsmall that its baneful influence upon animal life is reduced to a\r\nminimum. The nitrogen is an inert, odorless gas, and its use in the air\r\nseems to be to dilute it, so that man and animals can breathe it. If all\r\nthe nitrogen were extracted from the air and only the oxygen left to\r\nbreathe, all animal life would be stimulated to death in a short time.\r\nThe presence of the nitrogen prevents too much oxygen from being taken\r\ninto the system at once. I suppose men and animals might have been so\r\norganized that they could breathe pure oxygen without being hurt, but\r\nthey were not, for some reason, made that way.\r\n\r\nAir contains more or less moisture in the form of vapor; this subject,\r\nhowever, will be discussed more fully under the head of evaporation. The\r\nair at sea-level weighs fifteen pounds to the square inch, and if the\r\nwhole envelope of air were homogeneous--the same in character--it would\r\nreach only about five miles high. But as it becomes gradually rarefied\r\nas we ascend, it probably extends in a very thin state to a height of\r\neighty or ninety miles; at least, at that height we should find a more\r\nperfect vacuum than can be produced by artificial means. The weight of\r\nall the air on the globe would be 11-2/3 trillion pounds if no deduction\r\nhad to be made for space filled by mountains and land above sea-level.\r\nAs it is, the whole bulk weighs something less than the above figures.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the air envelopes the globe to a height at sea-level of\r\neighty or ninety miles, gradually thinning out into the ether that fills\r\nall interstellar space. We live and move on the bottom of a great ocean\r\nof air. The birds fly in it just as the fish swim in the ocean of water.\r\nBoth are transparent and both have weight. Water in the condensed state\r\nis heavier than the air and will seek the lowest places, but when\r\nvaporized, as in the process of evaporation, it is lighter than air and\r\nfloats upward. In the vapor state it is transparent like steam. If you\r\nstudy a steam jet you will notice that for a short distance after it\r\nissues from the boiler it is transparent, but soon it condenses into\r\ncloud.\r\n\r\nIf we could see inside of a boiler in which steam had been generated,\r\nall the space not occupied with water would seem to be vacant, since\r\nsteam before it is condensed is as transparent as the air. We will,\r\nhowever, speak of this subject more fully under the head of evaporation\r\nand cloud formation. It is not enough that we have the air in which we\r\nlive and move, with all of its properties, as we have described:\r\nsomething more is needed which is absolutely essential both to animal\r\nand vegetable life--and this essential is motion. If the air remained\r\nperfectly still with no lateral movement or upward and downward currents\r\nof any kind, we should have a perfectly constant condition of things\r\nsubjected only to such gradual changes as the advancing and receding\r\nseasons would produce owing to the change in the angle of the sun's\r\nrays. No cloud would ever form, no rain would ever fall, and no wind\r\nwould ever blow. It is of the highest importance not only that the wind\r\nshall blow, but that comparatively sudden changes of temperature take\r\nplace in the atmosphere, in order that vegetation as well as animal life\r\nmay exist upon the surface of the globe. The only place where animal\r\nlife could exist would be in the great bodies of water, and it is even\r\ndoubtful if water could remain habitable unless there were means\r\nprovided for constant circulation--motion.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of the atmosphere is such that the least influence that\r\nchanges its balance will put it in motion. While we can account in a\r\ngeneral way for atmospheric movements, there are many problems relating\r\nto the details that are unsolved. We find that even the \"weather man\"\r\nmakes mistakes in his prognostications; so true is this that it is never\r\nsafe to plan a picnic for to-morrow based upon the predictions of\r\nto-day. The chief difficulty in the way of solving the great problems\r\nrelating to the sudden changes in the weather and temperature lies in\r\nthe fact that two-thirds or more of the earth's surface is covered with\r\nwater; thus making it impossible to establish stations for observation\r\nthat would be evenly distributed all over the earth's surface. Enough is\r\nknown, however, to make the study of meteorology a most wonderfully\r\ninteresting subject.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that air is composed of a mixture of oxygen and\r\nnitrogen chiefly, with a small amount of carbon dioxide. So far as the\r\nlife and health of the animal is concerned we could get along without\r\nthis latter substance, but it seems to be a necessity in the growth of\r\nvegetation. There are other things in the air which, while they are\r\nunnecessary for breathing purposes, it will be well for us to\r\nunderstand, as some of them are things to be avoided rather than\r\ninhaled.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, air contains moisture, which is a very variable\r\nquantity. In a cold day in winter it is not more than one-thousandth\r\npart, while in a warm day in summer it may equal one-fortieth of the\r\nquantity of air in a given space. There is also a small amount of\r\nammonia, perhaps not over one-sixty-millionth. Oxygen also exists in the\r\nair in very small quantities in another form called ozone. One way to\r\nproduce ozone is by passing an electric spark through air. Anyone who\r\nhas operated a Holtz machine has noticed a peculiar smell attending the\r\ndisruptive discharges, which is the odor of ozone. It is what chemists\r\ncall an allotropic form of oxygen, just as the diamond, graphite, and\r\ncharcoal are all different forms of carbon, and yet the chemical\r\ndifferences are scarcely traceable. It is more stimulating to breathe\r\nthan oxygen and is probably produced by lightning discharges.\r\n\r\nAs has been before stated, the oxygen of the air is consumed by all\r\nprocesses of combustion, and in this we include the breathing of men and\r\nanimals and the decay of vegetable matter, as well as the more active\r\ncombustion arising from fires. A grown person consumes something over\r\n400 gallons of oxygen per day, and it is estimated that all the fires on\r\nthe earth consume in a century as much oxygen as is contained in the air\r\nover an area of seventy miles square. All of these processes are\r\nthrowing into the air carbon dioxide (carbonic acid), which, however, is\r\noffset by the power of vegetation to absorb it, where the carbon is\r\nretained and forms a part of the woody fiber and pure oxygen is given\r\nback into the air. By this process the normal conditions of the air are\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nOne decimeter (nearly 4 inches) square of green leaves will decompose in\r\none hour seven cubic centimeters of carbon dioxide, if the sun is\r\nshining on them; in the shade the same area will absorb about three in\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nThere is another substance in the form of vegetable germs in the air\r\ncalled bacteria. At one time these were supposed to be low forms of\r\nanimal life, but it is now determined that they are the lowest forms of\r\nvegetable germs. Bacteria is the general or generic name for a large\r\nclass of germs, many of them disease germs. By analysis of the air in\r\ndifferent locations and in different parts of the country it has been\r\ndetermined that on the ocean and on the mountain tops these germs\r\naverage only one to each cubic yard of air. In the streets of the\r\naverage city there are 3000 of them to the cubic yard, while in other\r\nplaces where there is sickness, as in a hospital ward, there may be as\r\nmany as 80,000 to the cubic yard. These facts go to prove what has long\r\nbeen well known, that the air of a city furnishes many more fruitful\r\nsources for disease than that of the country. Some forms of bacterial\r\ngerms are not considered harmful, and they probably perform even a\r\nuseful service in the economy of nature. Within certain limits, other\r\nthings being equal, the higher one's dwelling is located above the\r\ncommon level the purer will be the air. This rule, however, has its\r\nlimits, as the oxygen of the air is heavier than the nitrogen, so that\r\nthe air at very great altitudes has not the same proportion of oxygen to\r\nnitrogen that it has at a lower level. An analysis that was made some\r\nyears ago of the air on the west shore of Lake Michigan, especially that\r\nsection where the bluffs are high, shows that it compares favorably with\r\nthat of any other portion of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, it is of the highest importance to the\r\nsanitary condition of any city, town, or village that it be not too\r\ncompactly built. If more than a certain number of people occupy a given\r\narea, it is absolutely impossible to preserve perfect sanitary\r\nconditions. And there ought to be a State law, especially for all\r\nsuburban towns, which are the homes and sleeping places for large\r\nnumbers of business men who spend their days in the foul air of the\r\ncity, stipulating that the houses shall be not less than a certain\r\ndistance apart. Oxygen is the great purifier of the blood, and if one\r\ndoes not get enough of it he suffers even though he breathes no\r\nimpurities. The power to resist the effects of bad air is much greater\r\nwhen one is awake and active than when asleep, and this is why it is\r\nmore important to sleep in pure air than to be in it during our waking\r\nhours. It is best, however, to be in good air all of the time. By pure\r\nair I do not mean pure oxygen, but the right mixture of the two gases\r\nthat make air. Too much of a good thing is often worse than not enough.\r\nPure food to eat, pure water to drink, and pure air to breathe would\r\nsoon be the financial ruin of a large class of doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAIR TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most recent definition of heat is that it is a mode of motion; not\r\nmovement of a mass of substance, but movement of its ultimate particles.\r\nIt has been determined by experiment that the ability of any substance\r\nto absorb heat depends upon the number of atoms it contains, rather than\r\nits bulk or its weight.\r\n\r\nIt has also been stated that the atmosphere at sea-level weighs about\r\nfifteen pounds to the square inch, which means that a column of air one\r\ninch square extending from sea-level upward to the extreme limit of the\r\natmosphere weighs fifteen pounds. The density of the air decreases as we\r\nascend. Each successive layer, as we ascend, is more and more expanded,\r\nand consequently has a less and less number of air molecules in a given\r\nspace. Therefore the capacity of the air for holding heat decreases as\r\nwe go higher.\r\n\r\nWe deduce from these facts that the higher we go the colder it becomes;\r\nand this we find to be the case. Whoever has ascended a high mountain\r\nhas had no difficulty in determining two things. One is that the air is\r\nvery much colder than at sea-level, and the other that it is very much\r\nlighter in weight. We find it difficult, when we first reach the summit,\r\nto take enough of oxygen into our lungs to carry on the natural\r\noperations of the bodily functions. To overcome this difficulty, if we\r\nremain at this altitude for a considerable time, we shall find that our\r\nlungs have expanded, so as to make up in quantity what is lacking in\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nIf a man lives for a long time at an altitude of 10,000 feet he will\r\nfind that his lungs are so expanded that he experiences some difficulty\r\nwhen he comes down to sea-level. And the reverse is true with one whose\r\nlungs are adapted to the conditions we find at sea-level, when he\r\nascends to a higher altitude. There is a constant endeavor on the part\r\nof nature to adapt both animal and vegetable life to the surroundings.\r\nWhile no exact formula has been established as to the rate of decrement\r\nof temperature as we ascend, we may say that it decreases about one\r\ndegree in every 300 or 400 feet of ascent. There is no exact way of\r\narriving at this, as in ascending a mountain the temperature will be\r\nmore or less affected by local conditions. If we go up in a balloon we\r\nhave to depend upon the barometer as a means of measuring altitude,\r\nwhich, owing to the varying atmospheric conditions, is not a reliable\r\nmode of measurement. It is easily understood that a cubic foot of air at\r\nsea-level will contain a great many more atoms than a cubic foot of air\r\nwill at the top of a high mountain; or, to state it in another way, a\r\ncubic foot of air at sea-level will occupy much more than a cubic foot\r\nof space 10,000 feet higher up. Suppose, then, that the amount of heat\r\nheld in a cubic foot of air at sea-level remained the same, as related\r\nto the number of atoms. In its ascent we shall find that at a high\r\naltitude the same number of atoms that were held at sea-level in a cubic\r\nfoot have been distributed over a so much larger space that the sensible\r\nheat is greatly diminished or diluted, so to speak. It was an old notion\r\nthat heat would hide itself away in fluids under a name called by\r\nscientists latent heat. This theory has been exploded, however, by\r\nmodern investigation.\r\n\r\nIf we place some substance that will inflame at a low temperature in the\r\nbottom of what is called a fire syringe (which is nothing but a cylinder\r\nbored out smoothly, with a piston head nicely fitted to it, so that it\r\nwill be air-tight) and then suddenly condense the air in the syringe by\r\nshoving the plunger to the bottom, we can inflame the substance which\r\nhas been placed in the bottom of the cylinder. In this operation the\r\nheat that was distributed through the whole body of air, that was\r\ncontained in the cylinder before it was compressed, is now condensed\r\ninto a small space. If we withdraw the plunger immediately, before the\r\nheat has been taken up by the walls of the syringe, we shall find the\r\nair of the same temperature as before the plunger was thrust down. This,\r\nhowever, does not take into account any heat that was generated by\r\nfriction.\r\n\r\nLet us further illustrate the phenomenon by another experiment. If we\r\nsuddenly compress a cubic foot of air at ordinary pressure into a cubic\r\ninch of space, that cubic inch will be very hot because it contains all\r\nthe heat that was distributed through the entire cubic foot before the\r\ncompression took place. Now let it remain compressed until the heat has\r\nradiated from it, as it soon will, and the air becomes of the same\r\ntemperature as the surrounding air. What ought to happen if then we\r\nshould suddenly allow this cubic inch of air to expand to its normal\r\npressure, when it will occupy a cubic foot of space?\r\n\r\nInasmuch as we allowed the heat to escape from it when in the condensed\r\nform, when it expands it will be very cold, because the heat of the\r\ncubic inch, now reduced to the normal temperature of the surrounding\r\nair, is distributed over a cubic foot of space.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what takes place when heated air at the surface of\r\nthe earth (which is condensed to a certain extent) rises to the higher\r\nregions of the atmosphere. There is a gradual expansion as it ascends,\r\nand consequently a gradual cooling, because a given amount of heat is\r\nbeing constantly distributed over a greater amount of space. At an\r\naltitude of forty-five miles it will have expanded about 25,000 times,\r\nwhich will bring the temperature down to between 200 and 300 degrees\r\nbelow zero.\r\n\r\nWhen we get beyond the limits of the atmosphere we get into the region\r\nof absolute cold, because heat is atomic motion, and there can be no\r\natomic motion where there are no atoms.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the atmosphere up to the point where it shades off\r\ninto the ether that is supposed to fill all interplanetary space. As\r\nDryden says:\r\n\r\n    There fields of light and liquid ether flow,\r\n    Purg'd from the pond'rous dregs of earth below.\r\n\r\nBy interplanetary space we mean all space between the planets not\r\noccupied by sensible material. It is the same as interatomic space, or\r\nthe space between atoms, except in degree, as the same substance that\r\nfills interplanetary space also fills interatomic space, so that all the\r\natoms of matter float in it and are held together from flying off into\r\nspace by the attraction of cohesion. What this ether is, has been the\r\nsubject of much speculation among philosophers, without, however,\r\narriving at any definite conclusion, further than that it is a substance\r\npossessing almost infinite elasticity, and whose ultimate particles, if\r\nparticles there be, are so small that no sensible substance can be made\r\nsufficiently dense to resist it or confine it. It is easy to see that a\r\nsubstance possessing such qualities cannot be weighed or in any way made\r\nappreciable to our senses. But from the fact that radiant energy can be\r\ntransmitted through it, with vibrations amounting to billions per\r\nsecond, we know that it must be a substance with elastic qualities that\r\napproach the infinite. Assuming that the ether is a substance, the\r\nquestion arises how is it related to other forms of substance? This is a\r\nquestion more easily asked than answered. The longer one dwells upon the\r\nsubject, however, the more one is impressed with the thought that after\r\nall the ether may be the one element out of which all other elements\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nChemistry tells us that there are between sixty and seventy ultimate\r\nelements. This is true at least as a basis for chemical science.\r\nChemical analysis has never been able to make gold anything but gold, or\r\noxygen anything but oxygen, and so on through the whole catalogue of\r\nelements. It may be, however, that the play of forces under and beyond\r\nthose that seem to be active in all chemical processes and relations,\r\nare able to produce certain affections of the ether, the result of which\r\nin the one case is an atom of gold and in the other an atom of oxygen,\r\netc., to the end of the list. In this case all of the so-called elements\r\nmay have their origin in one fundamental element that we call the ether.\r\nI am aware that we are wading in deep water here, but sometimes we love\r\nto get into deep water just to try our swimming powers. The above is a\r\nsuggestion of a theory called \"the vortex theory,\" that is taking root\r\nin the minds of many philosophers to-day, and yet there is almost\r\nnothing of known facts to base such a theory upon, and nearly all we can\r\nsay about it is that it seems plausible, when viewed through the eye of\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nWe do know that substances, such as fluids or gases, assume very\r\ndifferent qualities when put into different rates of motion. A straw has\r\nbeen known to penetrate the body of a tree endwise by the extreme\r\nvelocity imparted to it when carried in the vortex of a tornado.\r\nInstances of the terrific solid power of substances that are mobile when\r\nat rest are often exhibited during the progress of a tornado, especially\r\nwhen confined in very narrow limits. Sometimes a tornado cloud will form\r\na hanging cone, running down to a sharp point at the lower end, which\r\nlower end may drag on the ground, or it may float a little distance\r\nabove the ground, but more frequently it moves forward with a bounding\r\nmotion, now touching the earth and now rising in the air. This cone is\r\nrevolving at a terrific speed. The substance revolving is chiefly air,\r\ncarrying other light substances that it has gathered up from the ground.\r\nIf it comes in contact with a tree or building it cuts its way through\r\nas though it were a buzzsaw revolving at a high rate of speed. This is\r\nnot simply the force of wind, but a kind of solidity given to the fluent\r\nair by its whirling motion.\r\n\r\nI remember a case in Iowa, where one of these revolving cones passed\r\nthrough a barnyard, striking the corner of the barn, cutting it off as\r\nsmoothly as though done with some sharp-edged tool, but it in no other\r\nway affected the rest of the building. One would suppose that the\r\ncentrifugal force developed in this whirling motion would cause the cone\r\nto fly apart, and why it does not no one certainly knows. But we are\r\nobliged to accept the fact.\r\n\r\nThese cases are cited to show that motion gives rigidity to substances\r\nthat in the quiescent state are mobile or easily moved, like the straw\r\nor the air. If we should assume that there are infinitesimal vortices or\r\nwhirling rings in the ether, of such rapidity as to give it different\r\ndegrees of rigidity, we can get a glimmering idea of how an atom of\r\nmatter may be formed from ether.\r\n\r\nReferring to the rigidity which motion gives to ordinary matter, it is\r\nwell known that when two vessels at sea collide the one having the\r\nhigher speed is not so liable to injury as the one with the lower. The\r\nreader will perhaps remember a circumstance said to have occurred a few\r\nyears ago on the Lake Shore Railroad, between Buffalo and Cleveland. The\r\nlimited express was going west, and while rounding a curve the engineer\r\nsuddenly came in sight of a wrecked freight train, a part of which was\r\nlying on the track where the express train had to pass. The engineer saw\r\nthat he was too near the wreck to stop his train and that the only way\r\nto save his own train and the lives of his passengers would be to cut\r\nthrough the wreck. He pulled out the throttle and put on a full head of\r\nsteam, and when the train struck the wreck it was going at such a high\r\nrate of speed that it cut through without seriously damaging the train\r\nand without harm to the passengers.\r\n\r\nThere are other heroes beside those who lead armies in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCLOUD-FORMATION--EVAPORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater exists in different forms without, however, undergoing any\r\nchemical change. It is when condensed into the fluid state that we call\r\nit \"water,\" and then it is heavier than the atmospheric air and\r\ntherefore seeks the low places upon the earth's surface, the lowest of\r\nwhich is the bed of the ocean. Wherever there is water or moisture on\r\nthe face of the globe there is a process going on at the surface called\r\nevaporation. This process is much more rapid under the action of heat\r\nthan when it is colder. In other words, as the heat increases\r\nevaporation increases within certain limits and bears some sort of a\r\nratio to it. Evaporation is not confined to water, but as our subject\r\nhas to deal with atmospheric phenomena we will speak of it only in its\r\nrelation to aqueous moisture.\r\n\r\nThe heat that is imparted to the earth's surface by the rays of the sun\r\nis able to separate water into minute particles, which, when so\r\nseparated, form what is called vapor, which is transparent, as well as\r\nmuch lighter than the air at the surface of the earth. Being lighter\r\nthan the air, it rises when disengaged and floats to the upper regions\r\nof the atmosphere. The atmosphere will contain a certain amount of these\r\ntransparent globules of moisture in the spaces between its own\r\nmolecules. If the air is warm the molecules will be farther apart and it\r\nwill contain more moisture than when it is cold.\r\n\r\nThe process of evaporation is one of the most important in the catalogue\r\nof nature's dynamics. Without it there would be no verdure on the hills,\r\nno trees on the plains, no fields of waving grain, and no animal life\r\nupon the land surface of the globe. Evaporation is nature's method of\r\nirrigation, and the system is inaugurated on a grand scale, so that\r\nthere are but few neglected spots upon the face of the earth which\r\nmoisture, carried up from the great reservoirs of water, does not reach.\r\nThe rate of evaporation, other things being equal, depends upon the\r\nextent of surface; therefore a smooth surface like that of the lake or\r\nocean will not send up as much vapor from a given area in square miles\r\nas an equal area of land will do, when it is saturated with moisture,\r\nfor the reason that there is a much larger evaporating surface on a\r\nsquare mile of land, owing to its inequalities, than upon an equal area\r\nof smooth water. Of course, if the earth is dry there can be but little\r\nevaporation. One of the effects of evaporation is to withdraw heat, and\r\nso to produce cold in the substance from which the evaporation takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIf we put water into a vial and drop regularly upon it some fluid that\r\nevaporates readily it will extract the heat from the vial and the water\r\nin it to such an extent that in a short time the water will be frozen.\r\nIn hot countries ice is manufactured on a large scale upon the principle\r\nthat we have just described. Water is put into shallow basins, excavated\r\nin the earth, over which is placed some substance like straw that\r\nreadily radiates heat, and on the straw are placed porous bricks, that\r\nare kept wet, thus furnishing a very large evaporating surface. In this\r\nway the process of evaporation is carried on very rapidly and the heat\r\nis extracted from the water to such an extent that it freezes, often\r\nforming ice in one night over an inch in thickness, and this in the\r\nhottest climates on the globe. Evaporation cannot go on in places where\r\nthe air is already saturated with moisture. When the air is dry\r\nevaporation is very rapid, but as it becomes more and more filled with\r\nmoisture the evaporation is checked to the same degree. This fact\r\naccounts for the difference of bodily comfort that we experience at\r\ndifferent times in the year when the temperature is the same. Sometimes\r\nwe are very uncomfortable although the temperature is not above 75\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, more so even than we are at other times when the\r\ntemperature is ten or fifteen degrees higher. If the air is saturated\r\nwith moisture, even though the temperature is not above 70 or 75\r\ndegrees, the perspiration is not readily evaporated from the surface of\r\nthe body. If the air is dry the temperature may be much higher and we be\r\nmuch more comfortable, because evaporation goes on rapidly, which keeps\r\nthe body not only dry, but cool. I remember passing through a desert in\r\nArizona where there was scarcely a green thing in sight in any\r\ndirection, and the temperature was said to be 140 degrees. I did not\r\nsuffer as much as I often have done in the East with the thermometer at\r\n80 or 90 degrees, and there was very little show of sensible\r\nperspiration; it was going on rapidly, however, but was being absorbed\r\nby the dry air. This goes to show that temperature is not the only\r\nfactor to be considered when we are making an estimate of the good or\r\nbad qualities of a climate.\r\n\r\nEvaporation is carried on much more rapidly when the wind blows than at\r\nother times, for the reason that the moisture is carried off laterally\r\nas fast as it is formed, all resistance to its escape into the upper air\r\nbeing removed. If the air is charged to saturation with moisture at a\r\ncertain temperature, it will remain so, and evaporation stops so long\r\nas the temperature remains unchanged. If its temperature rises the\r\nprocess of evaporation can start up, because the capacity of the air for\r\nholding moisture has been increased. But if a temperature is perceptibly\r\nlowered another phenomenon will manifest itself.\r\n\r\nIn the uncondensed state vaporized moisture is quite transparent, so\r\nthat we are able to see through it as we do through a pane of glass. If,\r\nhowever, the body of air that is saturated with this invisible moisture\r\nbecomes suddenly chilled, the moisture condenses into cloud or mist.\r\n\r\nIf we watch a passing railroad train we shall notice a mass of fleecy\r\nwhite mist floating away from the smokestack, assuming the billowy forms\r\nof some of the clouds in summer. This cloud is produced by the sudden\r\ncondensation of steam, which was transparent before it came in contact\r\nwith the cold, outside air, the effect being much more pronounced in\r\ncold than in warm weather. We may liken these floating globules of mist\r\nto the dust of the earth which floats in the air, and it has not been\r\ninaptly called water-dust. Anyone who has seen an atomizer used or has\r\nstood at the foot of a great waterfall, like Niagara, has seen the fluid\r\nso finely divided that it will float in the air, instead of falling to\r\nthe ground. What takes place is that a number of these transparent atoms\r\nof moisture that are released in the process of evaporation coalesce\r\ninto one small drop or particle of water, and they will continue to\r\nfloat in the air as mist or cloud until a sufficient number have\r\ncombined into one solid mass to render that mass heavier than the air,\r\nwhen it falls in the form of rain.\r\n\r\nIf we live in a region--and there are such on the face of the\r\nearth--where there is very little evaporation and consequently very\r\nlittle moisture in the air, there is rarely ever a cloud seen nor is\r\nthere any rainfall, for the reason that there is no material existing\r\nout of which to form clouds, and the clouds precede the rain. Hence, all\r\nthe artificial attempts to produce rain in these arid regions have been\r\nfutile. If a body of warm air, when saturated with invisible moisture,\r\nis suddenly chilled by coming in contact with a cold wave, it is\r\nsqueezed like a sponge, so to speak, and the invisible particles become\r\nvisible because a number of them have coalesced as one particle; the\r\nparticles gather in a large mass, and we have the phenomenon of cloud\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nClouds more generally form in the upper regions of the atmosphere\r\nbecause it is normally colder in the higher regions. In some cases\r\nclouds float very high in the air and in others very low. This is due to\r\ntwo causes:\r\n\r\nIf we should send up a balloon containing air rarefied to a certain\r\nextent it would continue to ascend only until it reached a point where\r\nthe outside air and that contained in the balloon are of the same\r\ndensity. If we should send up this same balloon on different days with\r\nthe same rarefaction of internal air we should find that on some days it\r\nwould float higher than others, because the density of the air is\r\nconstantly fluctuating, as is indicated by the rise and fall of the\r\nbarometer. Now let us consider the balloon as a globule of moisture of a\r\ndefinite weight, and this globule only one of an aggregation of globules\r\nsufficient to form a cloud. We can readily see from what has gone before\r\nthat a cloud thus formed, having a definite density and weight, would\r\nfloat higher some days than others.\r\n\r\nAssuming again that the density of the air remains the same from day to\r\nday, the clouds will still float high or low in the atmosphere from\r\nanother cause. Let us go back to our illustration of the balloon. If we\r\nhave a fixed condition of atmosphere, external to the balloon, and vary\r\nthe conditions internally, which means varying its weight, the balloon\r\nwill float higher or lower as the internal conditions are varied. Now\r\napply this principle to the moisture globules of which a cloud is formed\r\nand we can understand why a cloud will float high or low from the two\r\ncauses that we have described. Clouds are of different color and\r\ndensity, and this is due to the differences of the make-up of the\r\nmoisture globules of which the clouds are formed. If these globules are\r\nin an advanced stage of condensation the cloud is darker and more\r\nopaque. In earlier conditions of condensation the cloud will have a\r\nbright look, which shows that it reflects most of the light, whereas in\r\nthe case of the dark cloud the light is largely absorbed.\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of notion prevailing that clouds come up from the\r\nhorizon, and in many cases they do, but they may form directly over our\r\nheads. There always has to be a beginning, and that occurs wherever the\r\nconditions are most favorable for condensation of vapor. If the earth is\r\nwet and the sun is hot the evaporation may be very rapid as well as the\r\nascent of the invisible moisture, which carries with it the air, which\r\nin turn expands the higher it rises, thus producing cold. This, taken\r\nwith the normal cold that exists in the higher regions, may be\r\nsufficient to produce a sudden condensation of this ascending vapor,\r\nwhich is all that is necessary to form a cloud.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry may arise, Why is the moisture condensed, almost always, in\r\nthe upper regions of the air, where it is rare? Because the more rare\r\nand therefore expanded it is, the more moisture it will hold. This,\r\ntaken with the fact that cold currents are encountered high up,\r\nsufficiently answers the question.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that the processes of nature are\r\ninterdependent. It is not enough that we have the evaporation of\r\nmoisture that will ascend into the higher regions of the air and there\r\nbe condensed into cloud and possibly rain, but we must have the means\r\nfor distributing these conditions over a large area, and for this\r\npurpose we have the phenomenon of wind. Why the winds blow can be\r\naccounted for to a certain extent,--we might say to a large extent,--but\r\nthere yet remain many unsolved problems relating to wind and weather. Of\r\nthe phenomena of wind we will speak more fully in a future chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCLOUD FORMATION--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs water in its condensed state is 815 times heavier than air, the\r\nquestion naturally comes to one why it does not immediately fall to the\r\nearth when it condenses. There are at least two and probably more stages\r\nof condensation. Investigators into the phenomenon of cloud formation\r\nclaim to have ascertained that the first effect of condensation is to\r\nform little globes of moisture that are hollow, like a bubble, with very\r\nthin walls. Everyone has recognized the ease with which a soap bubble\r\nwill float in the air, and yet it is simply a film of moisture. These\r\nlittle balloons, so to speak, are called spherules. It is undoubtedly\r\nthe case that mingled with these little bubbles of moisture there are\r\nfine particles of solid water hanging on and carried along with them.\r\nUndoubtedly this is true; at least just before the final act of\r\ncondensation takes place; and when the little hollow spherules collapse\r\nthey are gathered together in drops of water larger or smaller according\r\nto the rapidity of condensation. There is probably another power at\r\nwork to prevent the too ready precipitation of moisture when condensed,\r\nand that is the wind. A cloud never stands still, although in some cases\r\nit may appear to do so. If we take a stone in our hand and allow it to\r\ndrop without applying any force to it, it will fall directly to the\r\nground. But if we give it an impetus in a horizontal direction it will\r\ntravel some distance before striking the ground. If we could give the\r\nsame impetus to a body as light as a globule of water-dust it would\r\nprobably travel indefinitely without falling. Dust that would settle\r\ndirectly to the ground from an elevation in still air would travel\r\nthousands of miles without falling, before a wind having any\r\nconsiderable velocity.\r\n\r\nSuppose the sun to be shining with intense heat upon a certain area of\r\nthe earth's surface and the conditions to be right for very rapid\r\nevaporation of moisture. The air which is heated close to the ground,\r\nbeing expanded, will rise, together with the invisible particles of\r\nmoisture, and there will be a column of moisture-laden air continually\r\nascending until it reaches a point in the upper atmosphere where it is\r\ncondensed into a cloud that takes on the billowy form which in summer\r\ntime we call a thunder cloud, but which in the science of meteorology is\r\ncalled cumulus, or heap-cloud. If there were no air currents this\r\nbillowy cloud would stand as the capping of an invisible pillar of\r\nascending vapor, but as it is never the case that air is not moving at\r\nsome velocity in the upper regions, it floats away as rapidly as it is\r\nformed. This peculiar kind of cloud is formed in the mid-regions of the\r\natmosphere, and it is a summer cloud as well as a land cloud. Of course,\r\nit may float off over the ocean and maintain its peculiar shape for a\r\ncertain distance, but it is rare that such a cloud would ever be seen in\r\nmid-ocean or in midwinter. As the warm season advances in summer, and\r\nevaporation from the earth is less than the rainfall, there is less and\r\nless moisture in the air, when, of course, the conditions for cloud\r\nformation, especially inland, are not so favorable as in the early\r\nspring or summer. Frequently there comes a time when we have a long\r\nseason of dry, settled weather. Probably during most of the days clouds\r\nwill form and we think it is going to rain, but before night they have\r\nvanished, and the same thing is repeated the next day and the next,\r\nperhaps for weeks at a time.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is this: We have already said that so long as the air\r\nremains in a uniform condition as to temperature it will absorb moisture\r\nin a transparent state until it is filled to the measure of its capacity\r\nat a given temperature. If there were no change of temperature, it would\r\nnot condense into cloud. Clouds may be absorbed into the atmosphere--or\r\nevaporated--and become invisible; and this process is going on to a\r\ngreater or less degree continually. If we watch the steam as it escapes\r\nfrom a steam boiler, the first effect is condensation into cloud, but as\r\nit floats away it gradually melts and is absorbed into the atmosphere as\r\ninvisible vapor. This is especially true on a warm day; the same process\r\ntakes place in the air that is going on at the level of a body of water\r\nor at the surface of moist earth.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, condensation always takes place when a body of\r\nmoisture-laden air comes in contact with cold. When the steam escapes\r\nfrom a boiler, even on the hottest day, it is hotter than the\r\nsurrounding air; the first effect is condensation, and then evaporation\r\ntakes place the same as it would at the surface of the earth when the\r\ncondensed particles of moisture are separated into the invisible atoms\r\nthat accompany evaporation.\r\n\r\nIn settled, dry weather as the sun approaches the zenith, the earth\r\nbecomes intensely heated, and there is an ascending column of air partly\r\nladen with moisture; but not to the same extent as earlier in the\r\nseason. Condensation takes place and clouds are formed, but as there is\r\nnot sufficient moisture to carry them to the point of a further\r\ncondensation,--which would result in precipitation,--as the sun lowers\r\nin the west and the heated air becomes more evenly distributed this\r\ncondensed vapor is reabsorbed into the air as invisible moisture by a\r\nprocess allied to that of evaporation. This condition of things would\r\nextend to a much longer period than it does in our latitude if it were\r\nnot for the gradual changing of the seasons, which finally destroys the\r\nbalance in the dynamics of cloud-land and allows the cold--that has been\r\nheld back for the time--in the great northern zone to get the upper\r\nhand. Then we have what is termed in common parlance a change in the\r\nweather, or, more properly in this case, a change in the season.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the cloud called cumulus (which means heap)\r\nand of its performance during the dry season of summer. There is another\r\nform of cloud that is seen at this season of the year called cirrus (a\r\ncurl). It takes the form of a curl at its ends. This cloud usually has a\r\nthreaded shape and sometimes takes the form of a feather, and frequently\r\nforms are seen that remind you of frost pictures on a window pane. These\r\nclouds float very high in the atmosphere, away above the tops of the\r\nhighest mountains, from six to eight miles above the level of the sea.\r\nThey are formed only at a season of the year when the atmospheric\r\nconditions are most uniform. At certain times of the day and night the\r\nmoisture will rise to this height before it condenses and when it does\r\ncondense it immediately freezes, which makes it take on these peculiar\r\nforms that would no doubt conform very closely to the frost pictures on\r\nthe window pane if it were not for the disturbing influences of air\r\ncurrents at this altitude. The fact that they are ice or frost clouds\r\ninstead of water clouds gives them that peculiar whiteness and\r\nbrightness of appearance. If ordinary clouds are water-dust these high\r\nclouds may be called ice-dust. Sometimes we see them lying in bands or\r\nthreads running across the sky in the direction that the wind blows.\r\nTheir form is undoubtedly a resultant of the struggle between the air\r\ncurrents and the tendency of crystallized water to arrange itself in\r\ncertain definite lines or forms. This cloud may be said to be one\r\nextreme, having its home in the highest regions of cloud-land, while the\r\ncumulus, or thunder cloud, is the other extreme and occupies the lower\r\nor mid regions of the air.\r\n\r\nThere is a still lower cloud of course, as ordinary fog is nothing more\r\nthan cloud, which under certain conditions lies on the surface of the\r\nocean or dry land. Fogs prevail when the barometer is low. As soon as it\r\nrises from the source of evaporation the moisture condenses almost to\r\nthe point of precipitation. There is not enough buoyancy in its\r\nglobules when the air is light, as it is when we have a low barometer,\r\nto cause the fog to float into the higher regions of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe high clouds, which are called cirrus, under certain conditions drop\r\ndown to where they begin to melt into ordinary moisture globules, and\r\nwhile this process is going on we have a combined cloud effect which is\r\ncalled cirro-stratus. This form of cloud may be recognized, when looking\r\noff toward the horizon, by its being formed into long straight bands. It\r\nis sometimes called thread-cloud. As it further descends it takes on a\r\ndifferent form called the cirro-cumulus, or curl-heap. This is just the\r\nopposite in its appearance to the cirro-stratus, as it is broken up into\r\nflocks of little clouds separated from each other and in the act of\r\nchanging to the form of the cumulus, or billowy form of cloud; and this\r\nlatter takes place when it drops to a still lower stratum of warmer air\r\nand is there called the cumulo-stratus, which is the form of cloud we\r\nmost often see in the season of thunderstorms. The lower edge of the\r\ncloud is straight, parallel with the horizon, while the upper part is\r\nmade up of great billowy masses, having high lights upon their well\r\ndefined projections and blending into darker shades caused by the\r\nshadows in the valleys between the mountains of cloud.\r\n\r\nThe rain cloud is called the nimbus, and may be said to be the extension\r\nof a cumulo-stratus. When it reaches this condition it is condensed to a\r\npoint where the vesicular globules collapse and a number of them run\r\ntogether, forming a solid drop of water, and here it begins to fall. It\r\nmay be very small at first, but in its fall other condensed globules\r\nwill adhere to it and if the conditions are right, sometimes the rain\r\ndrops will have the diameter of a quarter of an inch by the time they\r\nreach the earth.\r\n\r\nUnder other conditions, such as we have sometimes during dry weather,\r\nthe rain drops will start to fall, but instead of growing larger, they\r\ngrow smaller by absorption into the thirsty air, and will not be allowed\r\nto reach the earth. Often there are showers of rain in the air that fall\r\nto a certain distance and are taken up, as in the process of\r\nevaporation, to again be formed into cloud, without ever having touched\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that clouds assume various forms under various\r\nconditions of atmosphere, as it is related to moisture, temperature, and\r\ndensity. Clouds sometimes appear to be stationary when they are only\r\ncontinually forming on one side and continually being absorbed into\r\ninvisible moisture on the other. I remember seeing some wonderfully\r\nbeautiful cloud effects in the regions of the Alps. Almost every day in\r\nsummer there appears above the peak of Mount Blanc a beautifully formed\r\ncloud cap standing some distance above it and hollowed out underneath\r\nlike an inverted cup. Although this cloud appears to be stationary, it\r\nis undergoing a rapid change; the moisture rises from the snow-capped\r\npeak as invisible vapor to a certain distance, where it is condensed\r\ninto a cloud of wonderful brilliancy. As the cloud globules float upward\r\nthey are absorbed into the atmosphere again, as invisible moisture at\r\nthe upper limit of the cloud. If the wind happens to be blowing, another\r\nphenomenon takes place, giving the appearance somewhat of a volcano. It\r\nis blown off from the peak in the direction of the wind, but within a\r\nshort distance it strikes a warmer stratum of air, where it is absorbed\r\nand assumes the transparent condition.\r\n\r\nIf we ascend a high mountain, we get some idea of the altitude of the\r\nvarious forms of cloud. A thunderstorm may be in progress far below us,\r\nwhile the sun may be shining from a clear sky above, with perhaps the\r\nexception of the frost clouds that we have referred to floating high\r\nabove the mountain tops.\r\n\r\nWe have now described in a general way how clouds are formed, how they\r\nare condensed into rain, and how moisture is distributed over large\r\nareas by these rain clouds being borne on the wings of the wind; and now\r\nyou ask, Whence the wind? In our next and following chapters we will try\r\nto answer this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWIND--WHY IT BLOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have said that globules of moisture, released by the action of the\r\nsun's rays in the process of evaporation, tend to rise because they are\r\nlighter than the air. Right here let it be said that all material\r\nsubstances have weight; even hydrogen, the lightest known gas, has\r\nweight, and is attracted by gravitation. If there were no air or other\r\ngaseous substances on the face of the earth except hydrogen, it would be\r\nattracted to and envelop the earth the same as the air now does. Carbon\r\ndioxide is a gas that is heavier than the air. If we take a vessel\r\nfilled with this gas and pour it into another vessel it will sink to the\r\nbottom and displace the air contained in it until the air is all driven\r\nout. If we fill a jar with water up to a certain height and then pour a\r\npint of shot into it the water will be caused to rise in the vessel\r\nbecause it has been displaced at the bottom by the heavier material. Now\r\nif we remove the shot the water will recede to the level maintained\r\nbefore the shot was put in. On the contrary, if we should pour an equal\r\nbulk of cork or pith balls into the jar the water would not be\r\ndisplaced, because the balls are lighter than the water and would lie on\r\ntop of it; if, however, the water is removed from the jar, the cork will\r\nimmediately go to the bottom of the jar, because the cork is heavier\r\nthan the air which has taken the place of the water. We wish to impress\r\nupon the mind of the reader the fact, that all substances of a fluidic\r\nnature, whether in the fluid or gaseous state, have weight, and obey the\r\nlaws of gravitation, and the heavier portions will always seek the lower\r\nlevels, and in doing this will displace the lighter portions, causing\r\nthem to rise. There is no tendency in any substance to rise of itself,\r\nbut the lighter substance rises because it is forced to do so by the\r\nheavier, which displaces it. This law lies at the bottom of all of the\r\nphenomena of air currents.\r\n\r\nIf we are at certain points on the seashore in the summer time we may\r\nnotice that about 9 o'clock in the morning a breeze will spring up from\r\nthe ocean and blow toward the land; this will increase in intensity\r\nuntil about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when it has reached its maximum\r\nvelocity, and from this time it gradually diminishes, until in the\r\nevening there will be a season of calm, the same as there was in the\r\nearly morning. The explanation of this peculiar action of the air is\r\nfound in the fact that during the day the land is heated much more\r\nrapidly on its surface than the water is.\r\n\r\nThe radiant energy from the sun is suddenly arrested at the surface of\r\nthe earth, which is heated to only a very shallow depth, while in the\r\nwater it is different; being transparent it is penetrated by the radiant\r\nenergy to a much greater depth and does not suddenly arrest it, as is\r\nthe case on land. As the sun rises and the rays strike in a more and\r\nmore vertical direction the earth becomes rapidly and intensely heated\r\nat its surface, and this in turn heats the stratum of air next above it,\r\nwhich is pressing on it with a force of fifteen pounds to the square\r\ninch at sea-level. When air is heated it expands, and as it expands it\r\ngrows lighter. The stratum lying upon the earth as soon as it becomes\r\nheated moves upward and its place is occupied by the heavier, cooler air\r\nthat flows in from the sides. We can now see that if there is a strong\r\nascending current of air on the land near the ocean the cooler air from\r\nthe surface of the ocean will flow in to take the place of the warmer\r\nand lighter air that is driven upward, really by the force of gravity\r\nwhich causes the heavier fluid to keep the lowest level. As the earth\r\ngrows hotter this movement is more and more rapid, which causes the\r\nflow of colder air to be quickened, and hence the increasing force of\r\nthe wind as the sun mounts higher in the heavens. But when it has passed\r\nthe point of maximum heating intensity and the earth begins to cool by\r\nradiation, the movements of air currents begin to slow up, until along\r\nin the evening a point is reached where the surface of the earth and\r\nthat of the ocean are of equal temperature, and there is no longer any\r\ncause for change of position in the air.\r\n\r\nThe earth heats up quickly, and it also cools quickly, especially if\r\nthere is green grass and vegetation. While they are poor conductors of\r\nheat, they are excellent radiators, so that when the sun's rays are no\r\nlonger active the earth cools down rapidly and soon passes the point\r\nwhere there is an equilibrium between the land and water. The water\r\npossesses the opposite quality. It is slow to become heated, because of\r\na much larger mass that is affected, and is equally slow to give up the\r\nheat. And the consequence is that after the sun has set, the land cools\r\nso much faster than the water that we soon have the opposite condition,\r\nand the sea is warmer than the land, which makes the air at that point\r\nlighter, and which in turn causes the denser or colder air from the land\r\nto flow toward the ocean, and displace the lighter air and force it\r\nupward; hence we have a land instead of a sea breeze. So that the\r\nnormal condition in summer is that of a breeze from the ocean toward the\r\nland during part of the day and a corresponding breeze from the land to\r\nthe ocean during part of the night, with a period of no wind during the\r\nmorning and evening of each day.\r\n\r\nThe forces that work to produce all the varying phenomena of air\r\ncurrents on different portions of the earth are difficult to explain, as\r\nthere are so many local conditions of heat and cold, and these are\r\nmodified by the advancing and receding seasons. The unequal distribution\r\nof land and water upon the earth's surface; the readiness with which\r\nsome portions absorb and radiate heat as compared with others; the tall\r\nranges of mountains, many of them snow-capped; the lowlands adjacent to\r\nthem that become intensely heated under the sun's rays; the diversity of\r\ncoastline and the fact that there is a zone of continually heated earth\r\nand water in the tropical regions--all these conditions, coupled with\r\nthe fact that the earth rotates on its axis once in twenty-four hours,\r\nare certainly sufficient to account for all the complicated phenomena of\r\naerial changes on the various portions of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nThe trade winds are so called because they blow in a certain definite\r\ndirection during certain seasons of the year, and can be reckoned upon\r\nfor the use of commerce. If you trace the line of the equator you will\r\nnotice that for more than three-quarters of the distance it passes\r\nthrough the water. The water, as we have explained in the last chapter,\r\nbecomes gradually heated to a considerable depth, and when once\r\nsaturated with heat is slow to give it up. It can easily be seen that\r\nthere will be a zone extending each way from the equator for a certain\r\ndistance that will become more intensely heated than any other parts of\r\nthe earth, with the exception of certain circumscribed portions of the\r\nland. The result is that this heated equatorial zone is constantly\r\nsending up warm air caused by the inrush of colder air, which is heavier\r\nthan the air at the equator, expanded by the heat. The warm air at the\r\nequator is forced up into the higher regions of the atmosphere, and here\r\nit overflows each way, north and south, causing a current of air in the\r\nupper regions counter to that of the lower. As it travels north and\r\nsouth it gradually drops as it becomes cooler, and finally at some point\r\nnorth and south its course is changed and it flows in again toward the\r\nequator. As a matter of fact, the trade winds do not flow apparently\r\nfrom the north and south directly toward the equator, but in an oblique\r\ndirection. On the north side of the equator we have a northeasterly\r\nwind, and a southeasterly wind on the south side. This is caused by the\r\nrotation of the earth from west to east. The direction of the trade\r\nwind, however, is more apparent than real.\r\n\r\nThe earth in its diurnal revolutions travels at the rate of a little\r\nmore than 1000 miles an hour at the equator. But if we should travel\r\nnorthward to within four miles, say, of the north pole, the surface\r\npoint would be moving at the rate of only about a mile an hour. At some\r\npoint equidistant between the north pole and the equator the surface of\r\nthe earth will be moving at a rate, say, of 500 miles an hour. If we\r\ncould fire a projectile from this point that would have a carrying power\r\nto take it to the equator some time after the projectile was fired,\r\nalthough it would fly in a perfectly direct line, it would appear to\r\nanyone at the equator who observed its approach to be moving from a\r\nnortheasterly direction. The reason is that the earth is traveling twice\r\nas fast at the equator as it is at the point whence the projectile is\r\nfired. Therefore it will overshoot, so to speak, at the equator, and not\r\nbe dragged around by the increased motion we find there.\r\n\r\nTo make this still plainer, suppose the earth to be standing still and a\r\nprojectile be fired directly across from the north pole in the direction\r\nof the lines of longitude and required one hour to reach the equator,\r\nthe projectile would appear to anyone standing at the equator to come\r\ndirectly from the north. If, however, the earth is revolving at the rate\r\nof 1000 miles an hour at the equator to the eastward, and the\r\nprojectile was fired from the pole, where there is practically no\r\nmotion, in the same direction along the longitudinal lines as before,\r\nthe observer would have to be in a position on the equator 1000 miles\r\nwest of this longitudinal line in order to see the projectile when it\r\narrived; therefore the apparent movement of the projectile would not be\r\nalong the line at the instant that it was fired, but along a line that\r\nwould cross the equator at a point 1000 miles west. When a southward\r\nimpulse is given to the air it follows, to some extent, the same law, so\r\nthat to one standing on the equator the northern trade wind will blow\r\nfrom the northeast and the southern trade wind from the southeast.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that the air rises in the heated zone there is always\r\na region of calms at this point where there is no wind and no rain.\r\nThere are two other regions of calms in the ocean, one at the north at\r\nthe tropic of Cancer and another at the south near the tropic of\r\nCapricorn. As has been stated, there are currents flowing back in the\r\nupper regions at the equator north and south, and these are called the\r\nupper trades--the lower currents being called the lower trades. These\r\nupper trades gradually fall till they reach the tropic of Cancer on the\r\nnorth, where the lower part of the current stops and bends back toward\r\nthe equator, now becoming a part of the lower trade wind. This causes a\r\ncalm at that point where it turns. The upper parts of this current\r\ncontinue on, in a northerly and southerly direction, on the surface\r\nuntil they meet with the cold air of the north and south polar regions,\r\nwhere there is a conflict of the elements--as there always is when cold\r\nand warm currents meet.\r\n\r\nThe only point where the trade wind has free play is in the South Indian\r\nOcean, and this is called the \"heart of the trades.\"\r\n\r\nIf the whole globe were covered with water there would be a more\r\nconstant condition of temperature; but owing to the great difference\r\nbetween the land and water, both as to altitude and the ability to\r\nabsorb and radiate heat, we have all of these varied and complicated\r\nconditions of wind and weather. The trade winds shift from north to\r\nsouth and vice versa with the advancing and receding seasons, due to the\r\nfact that the earth has a compound motion. It not only revolves on its\r\naxis once in twenty-four hours, but it rocks back and forth once a year,\r\nwhich is gradually changing the direction of its axis; and in addition\r\nto these motions it is traveling around the sun as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWIND--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last chapter we discussed the winds that prevail in the regions\r\nof the tropics called trade winds, because they follow a direct course\r\nthrough the year, with the exceptions noted in regard to their shifting\r\nto the north or south with the changing seasons; we also described the\r\nphenomena of land and sea breezes, which during certain seasons of the\r\nyear reverse their direction twice daily. We will now describe another\r\nkind of wind, called monsoons, that prevail in India.\r\n\r\nIndia lies directly north of the great Indian Ocean, and the lower part\r\nof it comes within the tropical belt lying south of the Tropic of\r\nCancer. During the summer season here the earth stores more heat during\r\nthe day than it radiates or loses during the night. This causes the wind\r\nto blow in a northerly direction from the sea both day and night for six\r\nmonths each year, from April to October. During these months the land is\r\ncontinually heated day and night to a higher temperature than the water\r\nin the ocean south of it. The winds are probably not so severe during\r\nthe night as through the day, as the difference between the temperature\r\nof the land and the water will not be so great during the night; and\r\ndifference of temperature between two points usually means a\r\nproportional difference in the velocity of the wind. There is a time in\r\nthe fall and spring, while there is a struggle between the temperature\r\nof the land and water for supremacy, when the winds are variable,\r\nattended with local storms somewhat as we have them in the temperate\r\nzone. But after the sun has moved south to a sufficient extent the land\r\nof India loses more heat at night than is stored up in the day; hence\r\nthe conditions during the winter months are reversed, the water is\r\nconstantly warmer than the land, and there is a constant wind blowing\r\nfrom the land to the ocean, which continues until April, when after a\r\nseason of local storms the conditions are established in the opposite\r\ndirection. These winds are called \"monsoons.\"\r\n\r\nThe word monsoon is probably derived from an Arabic word meaning\r\n\"seasons.\" It is a peculiarity of this monsoon that in summer it blows\r\nin a northeasterly direction from the sea and in the winter in a\r\nsouthwesterly direction from the land. This divergence from a direct\r\nnorth and south is caused by the rotation of the earth and the\r\nexplanation is the same as that we have given for the trade winds.\r\n\r\nIn the southern latitudes there is a comparatively constant condition\r\nof wind and weather, because the surface of the globe in these regions\r\nis mostly water; but in the north, where most of the land surface is\r\nlocated, we have a very different and a very complicated set of\r\nconditions, as compared with the southern zones.\r\n\r\nThe freaks of wind and weather that we find prevailing upon the North\r\nAmerican continent are not so easily accounted for as the phenomena\r\nheretofore discussed. In the northern part the land reaches far up\r\ntoward the north pole, while on the west lies the Pacific Ocean, which\r\nmerges into the Arctic Ocean at Bering Strait. The climate of the\r\nwestern coast is affected by a warm ocean current that sets up as far\r\nnorth as Alaska, while high ranges of mountains prevent the effects of\r\nthis warm current from being felt inland to any great extent; all of\r\nwhich helps to complicate any theory that may be advanced regarding\r\nchanges of weather. Aside from the changes of temperature that are due\r\nto the seasons, which are caused by the oscillating motion of the earth\r\nbetween the limits of the Tropic of Cancer on the north and the Tropic\r\nof Capricorn on the south, there are other changes constantly taking\r\nplace in all seasons of the year. While it is not difficult to account\r\nfor the change of seasons and the gradual change of temperature that\r\nwould naturally follow--owing to the difference of angle at which the\r\nsun's rays strike the earth--it is more difficult to account for the\r\nviolent changes that occur several times during the progress of a\r\nseason, as well as the less violent ones that come every few days. In\r\nfact, it rarely happens that the temperature is exactly the same on any\r\ntwo successive days during the year. The diurnal changes are easily\r\naccounted for by the rotation of the earth on its axis each day. But\r\nthere is another class of phenomena with which the \"weather man\" has to\r\nstruggle when he is making up a forecast of the weather from day to day.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may proceed intelligently, let us say a word about the\r\nbarometer. We speak of high and low barometer, and we make the\r\ninstrument with graduations marked for all kinds of weather, which\r\nreally mean but very little. The reading of a single barometer alone\r\nwill give us but a faint idea of what is really going to happen from day\r\nto day. But if we have a series of barometers located at different\r\nstations scattered all over the continent and connected at headquarters\r\nby telegraph, so that we can have the readings from a whole series of\r\nbarometers at once, then it becomes a very useful instrument. A\r\nbarometer may read low at one station by the scale, but may be high with\r\nreference to some other barometer that reads very low.\r\n\r\nWhat is a barometer? If we should take a glass tube closed at one end,\r\nthe area of the cross section of which is one inch square, and fill it\r\nwith mercury, and while thus filled plunge the open end into a vessel of\r\nmercury, it will be found that the amount of mercury remaining in the\r\ntube above the level of the mercury in the vessel will weigh about\r\nfifteen pounds, if the experiment has been performed at sea-level. This\r\nwill vary, however, according to the temperature of the air. Of course\r\nbarometers are tested when the air is at a certain temperature. If the\r\nweight of mercury in the tube is fifteen pounds, since it is sustained\r\nby the air pressing down on the mercury in the open vessel, it shows\r\nthat the air-pressure on that open vessel is equal to fifteen pounds to\r\nthe square inch. In practice, of course, the tubes are made very much\r\nsmaller. If the air changes so that it is lighter than normal the\r\nmercury will fall in the tube, because the pressure on the mercury in\r\nthe open vessel is less than fifteen pounds to the square inch. And,\r\nagain, conditions may arise that will condense the air and make it for\r\nthe time being weigh more than fifteen pounds to the square inch, in\r\nwhich case the mercury will rise in the tube. Thus it will be seen that\r\nthe barometer will register the slightest change in air pressure.\r\n\r\nLet us dwell for a moment on the causes of what are commonly called\r\n\"changes of weather,\" when we will again revert to the use of the\r\nbarometer.\r\n\r\nThe use of the telegraph in connection with the establishment of a\r\nweather bureau having stations for observation at convenient points\r\nthroughout the country has contributed much to the science of\r\nmeteorology. It is found that there are areas of high and low pressure\r\nexisting at the same time in different parts of the country. These\r\nusually have their origin in the far northwest, and follow each other,\r\nsweeping down the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains and gradually\r\nbending easterly and from that to northeasterly by the time they reach\r\nthe Atlantic coast. The areas of low pressure are called cyclones, while\r\nthe areas of high pressure are called anti-cyclones. (By cyclone we do\r\nnot mean those cloud funnels commonly called by that name that form at\r\ncertain times of the year in certain sections of the country and produce\r\nsuch destruction of life and property. These storms are usually confined\r\nto a narrow strip and are short-lived. They arise undoubtedly from local\r\nconditions. A description of these tornadoes--for such is their true\r\nname--will be given in some future chapter.)\r\n\r\nThese centers of high and low pressure may be several hundred miles\r\napart. In the area of high pressure, if it is in the winter season, the\r\nweather is unusually clear and cold, and generally clear and fairly cool\r\nat any season, and while there may be some wind it is not so strong as\r\nin the cyclone or low-pressure center. At this point it will be warmer\r\nand winds will prevail, with rain or snow, the winds varying in\r\ndirection and intensity at a given point as the cyclone moves forward.\r\nIn the center of these cyclones and anti-cyclones there will be a region\r\nof comparative calm, and the air is ascending at the center of the area\r\nof low pressure while it is pouring in on all sides from the area of\r\nhigh pressure where the air is compressed by a downward current from the\r\nupper regions.\r\n\r\nThe high-pressure or anti-cyclone system usually covers a larger area\r\nthan the low-pressure system, where the air is ascending. While the air\r\nmoves laterally from high to low, it does not move in a direct line. The\r\nair movement outside of the high-pressure center is usually not at a\r\nvery high speed, but in northern latitudes in the direction of the hands\r\nof a clock. As it circles around it widens out spirally until it reaches\r\nthe edge of a low-pressure system, when it bends in its course and moves\r\nin the other direction around this center, but constantly moving inward\r\ntoward it in a spiral form and in a direction that is reverse to that of\r\nthe hands of a clock. When the air current comes within the influence\r\nof a low-pressure or cyclonic system the velocity of its movement is\r\nvery much accelerated until it has moved into the zone of quiet air in\r\nthe center, where it is ascending.\r\n\r\nIn the upper regions of the atmosphere there are counter currents\r\nflowing in the opposite direction. The downward flow at the area of high\r\npressure compresses the air near the surface of the earth and rarefies\r\nit in the higher regions of the atmosphere, while the opposite effect is\r\ngoing on over the center of low pressure, the air being rarefied nearer\r\nthe surface of the earth, but condensed above normal in the higher\r\nregions by the upward current, which causes an overflow back toward the\r\nrarefied upper regions over the area of high pressure.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the ordinary storm has a compound motion. The\r\nwhole system moves in an easterly direction, while the winds are blowing\r\nspirally about the storm center. If we should be in the track of a\r\nmoving storm so that its center passed over us the winds at the\r\nbeginning would blow in one direction and then there would come a\r\nsubsidence until it had moved forward through the quiet zone, when we\r\nshould feel the wind in the opposite direction until the area of low\r\npressure had moved forward into the region of high pressure. The\r\nvelocity of the wind will be determined by the difference of pressure\r\nbetween the areas and by the distance that the areas of high and low\r\npressure are apart. The steeper the grade the more rapidly the fluid\r\nwill flow.\r\n\r\nLet us now have recourse, for a moment, to Figs. 1, 2, and 3 in order\r\nthat the subject may be more fully understood. In looking at these\r\ndiagrams we should imagine ourselves looking South, with the left hand\r\nto the East.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows the general direction of the air movement between two\r\nareas--one of high and the other of low pressure. The arrows show the\r\ngeneral direction of the wind. You will notice that in the upper regions\r\nit blows in an opposite direction from the air movement on the surface\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 shows in a general way how the wind moves spirally around both\r\ncenters. Over the area of high pressure the air descends spirally from\r\nthe upper regions, circling around a large area--it may be one hundred\r\nmiles or more in diameter--in the direction of the movement of the hands\r\nof a clock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nBut then the wind at the high-pressure area is lighter than it is at the\r\nlow, and circles outwardly until it finally moves off in the direction\r\nof a low-pressure area, gradually bending in the other direction until\r\nfinally it moves the reverse of the hands of a clock--although now it is\r\nin a smaller circle, and with a more rapid motion. It moves spirally and\r\nupwardly about the low-pressure area until it reaches a point in the\r\nupper air, where it goes through the same gyrations in an opposite\r\ndirection. Now imagine the whole combination moving from west to east at\r\nan average rate of thirty miles per hour, and imagine further that this\r\nsystem is linked to other systems that are following along, and you have\r\nsome idea of the weather changes as they occur in the middle United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBy referring to Fig. 3 you will see why the wind changes its direction\r\nwhen a storm center passes over any point. It has not only a spiral but\r\nalso a forward movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nNow let us go back to the barometer and see what part it plays in\r\npredicting changes in the weather. At the area of low pressure the air\r\nis ascending, as we have seen, and, owing to the peculiar way it\r\nascends--by circling spirally upward around a region of comparative\r\ncalm--it creates a partial vacuum, which is more pronounced in the\r\ncenter of the area. At the area of high pressure the air will be\r\ncondensed by the descending current being arrested by the earth. The\r\ndescending current--coming, as it does, from the upper and colder\r\nregions--accounts for the cool weather that most always prevails at a\r\nhigh-pressure area. In order to know how great the change of weather is\r\nlikely to be, we must know what the readings of at least two barometers\r\nare--one at the high- and another at the low-pressure area. If the\r\ndifference between the readings of the two barometers is very great, and\r\nthe areas are comparatively close together, we may expect the change to\r\nbe sudden and violent.\r\n\r\n\"High\" and \"low\" as applied to a barometer are only relative terms.\r\nThere is no fixed point on the index of the instrument that can be said\r\nto be arbitrarily high or low. For this reason a single barometer is not\r\nof much use. If it begins to fall from any point, and falls rapidly, it\r\nindicates that an area of a much lower pressure is approaching. The same\r\nis true of a high-pressure area, if the barometer rises rapidly from any\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIf we study the air motions in these systems sufficiently to get at\r\nleast an inkling of the law of their movements, it becomes a very\r\ninteresting subject.\r\n\r\nWind from whatever cause serves a wonderfully useful purpose in the\r\neconomy of nature. Without wind, heat and moisture could not be\r\ndistributed over the face of the earth and our globe would not be a fit\r\nhabitation for man. How wonderful is the machinery of Nature, that can\r\nfirst forge a world into shape and afterward decorate it with green\r\ngrass and flowers that are watered by the \"early and latter rain\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nLOCAL WINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so many causes that will produce air motion that it is often\r\ndifficult to determine just what one is the chief factor in causing the\r\ndirection of the wind at any particular time. There are very many\r\ninstances, however, where the cause can be traced without difficulty;\r\nmany of these have already been mentioned and there are many more that\r\nmight be. Of course, as has been often stated, there is only one remote\r\ncause for all winds, and that is the sun, coupled with the movements of\r\nthe earth. But there are certain local conditions that are continually\r\nmodifying the phenomena of air movement. The velocity of winds as they\r\noccur from day to day varies very greatly with the height above the\r\nsurface of the earth; ordinarily the velocity at 1000 feet above the\r\nearth will be more than three times greater than it is at 50 or 60 feet\r\nabove, and even at 60 feet the velocity is much greater than at the\r\nsurface of the earth. This is due partly to the retarding effect of\r\nfriction caused by contact of the air with the earth's surface, but more\r\nparticularly by trees, inequality of surface, and other obstructions on\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of wind called mountain winds that arise from\r\ndifferent causes. As has been stated in a former chapter, under ordinary\r\nconditions the air is more dense at sea-level than at any point above,\r\nand the density is constantly changing from denser to rarer the higher\r\nwe ascend. Suppose at a certain point, say halfway up a mountain side,\r\nthe air has a certain density, and if it is at rest the lines of equal\r\ndensity or pressure will seek a level, just as water would under the\r\nsame conditions. Suppose we start at a given point on the side of a\r\nmountain and run out on a level till we are 100 feet in a perpendicular\r\nline above the side of the mountain, the air contained within those\r\nlines will be in the shape of a triangle. If now the sun shines upon the\r\nside of the mountain the air is warmed and expands according to a\r\nwell-known law, and the amount of expansion will depend upon the depth\r\nof the volume of air; hence the point of greatest expansion in our\r\nfigure will be where the air is 100 feet deep, and will gradually\r\ndecrease as we go toward the mountain till we come to the point where\r\nour horizontal line makes contact with the mountain side. At that point,\r\nof course, there is no expansion, because there is no depth of air; and\r\nthe effect will be that the expanded air will overflow toward the\r\nmountain, and be deflected up its sloping side. If we apply this same\r\nprinciple to the whole mountain side we can see that there will be,\r\nduring the day, a constant current of air flowing up the mountain. As\r\nnight comes on this upward movement will cease and there will be a\r\nseason of quiet until the earth has become colder than the air, and we\r\nhave a phenomenon of exactly the opposite kind, when the air contracts\r\ninstead of expands, which produces a downward current from the mountain\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nThese currents are as regular at certain seasons of the year as the land\r\nand sea breeze. Of course, they may be obliterated for the time being,\r\nby the presence of a stronger wind due to some other cause, such as\r\nduring the prevalence of a storm. In some of the regions of California\r\nhottest during the day time, the nights are made endurable, and even\r\ndelightful, by the cool breezes that sweep down from the tops of the\r\nmountains. It often happens that on the shady side of a high and steep\r\nmountain where the sun's rays strike it so obliquely, if at all, that\r\nthe earth will be but little heated, there will be a vast mass of cold\r\nair stored up. After the valley has become intensely heated by the sun\r\nthere is an ascending current of air which in turn causes a down rush\r\nof the cold body of air from the mountain side. These local winds are\r\nfrequently very severe, only lasting, however, for a short time, until\r\nan equilibrium of temperature and density has been established. A\r\nwonderful exhibition of this sort of wind is said to occur at certain\r\ntimes of the year on the coast at Tierra del Fuego, where a blast which\r\nthey call the \"Williwaus,\" comes down from the mountain side, without\r\nwarning, with such tremendous force that no ship could stand the strain\r\nif it should continue for any length of time. Fortunately the shock does\r\nnot last more than eight or ten seconds, when it is followed by a\r\nperfect calm. It is as though a great volume of air had been fired from\r\nsome enormous cannon from the top of the mountain to the sea. The water\r\nis pulverized into a spray that is driven in every direction.\r\n\r\nSometimes these violent blasts occur in the Alps, but from a very\r\ndifferent cause. Avalanches of great extent often take place on the\r\nsides of the mountains, when a vast amount of material, equal to three\r\nor four hundred million cubic feet of earth, will fall several thousand\r\nfeet. Often an avalanche of this kind will produce a wind, which is\r\nconfined, of course, to a restricted area, that is said to be so violent\r\nas to tear one's clothes into shreds. This is not caused by any\r\ndifference of temperature, but by a violent compression.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar wind that occurs in Switzerland, often, between the\r\nmonths of November and March. These winds last from two to three days\r\nand are of great violence--especially near the mountains. They are warm\r\nand dry and are caused by an area of low barometer and an ascending\r\ncurrent of air occurring at some point north of the Alps, which causes\r\nthe air from Italy to flow over the Alpine range, causing a tremendous\r\nprecipitation of snow and rain, which not only takes the moisture from\r\nthe air, but sets free in the form of heat the energy that was stored in\r\nthe process of evaporation, and this, together with the compression of\r\nthe air as it flows down the slope of the mountains, makes it hot and\r\ndry. This wind is called the \"Fohn.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a similar condition of things existing on the eastern slope of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains which has a modifying effect upon the climate of\r\nparts of Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, also extending up into British\r\nAmerica. This wind, which is here called \"chinook,\" arises from causes\r\nsimilar to those that are active in Switzerland that give rise to the\r\n\"fohn\" wind.\r\n\r\nThere is a wind called the \"blizzard\" that is felt most keenly in\r\nMontana and the Dakotas during the winter, which is exceedingly cold and\r\nlasts sometimes for a period of 100 hours. The temperature falls at\r\ntimes 30 or 40 degrees below zero and the wind maintains a velocity of\r\nfrom forty to fifty miles an hour. These winds spread eastward as far as\r\nIllinois, but not with the same severity, and they move southward to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, spreading over the States of Texas and Louisiana, and\r\nare there called \"northers.\" It is exceedingly dangerous to be caught in\r\na blizzard in the Dakotas, where the wind reaches its greatest velocity\r\nand the cold its lowest temperature--especially when the wind is\r\naccompanied, as it frequently is, by severe snowing. By the time it\r\nreaches the Gulf States it is very much modified as to temperature, but\r\nit is a very disagreeable wind in that portion of the country, because\r\nof the exceeding dampness of the air. One would be much more comfortable\r\nin dry, still air, even if it were many degrees below zero, than in an\r\nair freighted with moisture, although the temperature has not fallen to\r\nthe freezing point.\r\n\r\nThere are hot winds called by different names according to the\r\nlocalities in which they occur. In southern California at certain\r\nseasons of the year the inhabitants are afflicted with what they call a\r\ndesert wind that blows from the heated regions of Arizona toward the\r\nPacific Ocean. The temperature sometimes reaches 120 degrees Fahrenheit,\r\nand persons have been known to perish from the effects of these hot\r\nwinds in open boats out on the water before they could reach land.\r\n\r\nHot winds prevail on the plains of Kansas during the months of July and\r\nAugust that are phenomenal in their intensity, so much so that if they\r\nwere widespread and of long continuance, like the northern blizzard,\r\nthey would be attended with great loss of life and destruction to\r\nvegetation. Fortunately, they come in narrow streaks and in most cases\r\ndo not blow more than from ten to thirty minutes at a time. These hot\r\nbelts are sometimes not over 100 feet wide, and again they are as much\r\nas 500. They are so hot and dry that green leaves and grass are rendered\r\nas dry as powder in a few minutes. These winds are probably caused by\r\nthe fact that at this season of the year, when the prevailing wind is\r\nsouthwesterly, the air becomes heated to a great height, and are the\r\nresulting effect of certain combinations of air currents in the higher\r\nregions of the atmosphere that force the already heated air toward the\r\nearth. As the air descends it is more and more compressed, which causes\r\nit to become more and more heated. We have already described the heating\r\neffect of compression upon air as shown by the experiment with the fire\r\nsyringe. It was shown that air at normal temperature could be suddenly\r\ncompressed into so small a space that the condensed heat, which was\r\nbefore diffused through the whole bulk of air at normal pressure, was\r\nsufficient to cause ignition. A cubic yard of air on the surface of the\r\nearth would occupy a much larger space if carried a mile above it. From\r\nthis it is easy to see that if a volume of air at that height had a\r\ntemperature of 70 or 80 degrees it would be very hot when condensed into\r\na very much smaller volume, as it would be if it were forced down to the\r\nsurface of the earth. These winds are the result of some superior force\r\nthat is active in the upper regions of the atmosphere, because it is\r\nnatural for heated air to rise, and this is what happens when the power\r\nthat forced it down to the earth is no longer active to hold it there.\r\n\r\nReference has been made in a former chapter to tornado winds; they are\r\nrather exceptional phenomena and not thoroughly understood. The winds\r\nseem to blow in from all directions toward an area of very low pressure\r\nat a single point. The spiral motion that is common to all cyclones, in\r\na tornado seems to be gathered up into a condensed form, like a funnel.\r\nThe direction of movement is the same as that of the cyclone--that is,\r\nin the reverse direction to that of the hands of a watch. The upward\r\nmotion of the air inside of the funnel is at a rate of over 170 miles an\r\nhour. The onward movement of the whole system is about thirty miles per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nTornadoes occur with greater frequency in the United States than in any\r\nother section of the globe. Tornadoes seldom occur in winter, except\r\nperhaps in the Southern States. They are more frequent in the month of\r\nMay than at any other time during the year, although they occur\r\nsometimes in April, June, and July.\r\n\r\nBetween 1870 and 1890 about sixty-five destructive tornadoes occurred in\r\nthe United States, involving great loss of life and property. When a\r\ntornado moves off the land on to the ocean it may become what is termed\r\na waterspout. These probably never originate on the water, but after\r\nthey have once formed may be carried over the water to a considerable\r\ndistance. A tornado was never known to originate on the shores of Lake\r\nMichigan, but there are a few instances (the most notable one being the\r\nRacine tornado) when they have reached the lake after having traveled\r\nfrom some distant point inland.\r\n\r\nThe Racine tornado--so called because it destroyed a large portion of\r\nthat city--happened fifteen or more years ago. The tornado originated\r\nabout 100 miles southwest of Racine, Wis., in northern Illinois. The\r\nfunnel-shaped cloud passed over the lake, but the tornado character of\r\nthe storm was broken up before it reached the other shore.\r\n\r\nWhen a tornado passes from land to water it becomes a waterspout only\r\nwhen the cloud-funnel hangs low enough and the gyratory energy is\r\nsufficiently great. There is a great pressure on the water outside of\r\nthe funnel and almost a perfect vacuum inside. This latter fact\r\ncontributes largely to the destructive power of the tornado. When a\r\nfunnel is central over a building a sudden vacuum is created outside of\r\nit and it bursts outwardly from the internal air pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nWEATHER PREDICTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo predict with any great accuracy what the weather will be from day to\r\nday is a somewhat complicated problem, and, as all of us have reason to\r\nknow, weather predictions made by those who have the matter in charge\r\nand are supposed to know all about it often fail to come to pass. The\r\nreal trouble is that they do not know all about it. There are so many\r\nconditions existing that are outside of the range of barometers,\r\nthermometers, anemometers, and telegraphs that no one can tell just when\r\nsome of these unknown factors will step in to spoil our predictions.\r\n\r\nIn very many cases, perhaps in a large majority of them, the predictions\r\nmade by the weather bureau substantially come to pass. It has been\r\nstated in former chapters that the changes of weather accompany the\r\nmovements of what are called cyclones and anti-cyclones, the cyclone\r\nbeing accompanied by low barometric pressure and the anti-cyclone by a\r\nhigher one. The winds of the cyclone move spirally around the center of\r\nlowest depression with an upward trend, the motions being in a direction\r\nreversed to that of the hands of a clock. In the centers of high\r\npressure the current is downward instead of upward and the direction of\r\nthe wind around it is opposite to that around the low-pressure area. The\r\nfundamental factor in predicting the weather is the direction of\r\nmovement of these areas of low pressure. In almost all cases the\r\ndirection of movement is from the west to the east, but not always in a\r\nstraight line. These movements, however, are classified so that after\r\nthe direction has become established one can predict with considerable\r\naccuracy as to whether it will move in a curved or a straight line. By\r\nmovement we do not refer to the direction of the wind at any particular\r\npoint, but the onward movement of the whole cyclonic system, which is\r\nusually from twenty-five to thirty miles an hour, but in some cases the\r\nspeed is much greater.\r\n\r\nNot only does the upward movement of the whole system vary, but the\r\nvelocity of the wind around any given cyclonic center varies. There are\r\nabout eleven classes of cyclones that appear in the United States, each\r\nclass having its own path of movement and origin. A large number of\r\nthese appear to originate north of the Dakotas, and move directly east\r\nto the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Three other classes originate on about the\r\nsame line, a little west,--say, north of Montana,--moving first in a\r\nsoutheasterly direction, passing over the center of Lake Michigan and\r\nbending northerly through Lake Ontario and finally landing in the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence. Two other classes start at the same point, one of them\r\ngoing as far south as Cincinnati, and the other as far south as\r\nMontgomery, Ala., and both turning at these points northeasterly to the\r\nGulf of St. Lawrence. Two other classes originate in Colorado, one\r\nmoving in a northeasterly direction slightly curved, and the other\r\ndirectly east. Still others have their origin farther south in the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, and move in a northeasterly direction. Very rarely they\r\noriginate in the Atlantic east of Savannah, moving first in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction, but finally bending to the northeast.\r\n\r\nEvery day there is a weather map made up showing the locations of the\r\nhigh and low barometers, direction of wind, lines of equal pressure, as\r\nwell as those of temperature. By study from year to year all of these\r\nphenomena have become systematized, so that by tracing an area of low\r\nbarometer from its origin in its progress easterly it is soon seen to\r\nfall under one of these classes and we are able to predict about what\r\nits course will be. Knowing the speed of its movement as well as the\r\nvelocity of wind and all the conditions attending it, taken in\r\nconnection with the weather conditions in the region for which the\r\nprediction is made, an expert can ordinarily forecast with some degree\r\nof accuracy. After all that can be said, however, weather predictions\r\nbased upon maps are and have been far from satisfactory. One who has\r\nbeen a close student of local conditions for a number of years will\r\noften predict with as great accuracy as the weather bureau. Areas of low\r\npressure are followed sooner or later by a fall of temperature; this is\r\nespecially true in the winter months. Sometimes this fall is very\r\nmarked, and then it is called a cold wave. These sudden changes of\r\ntemperature are not thoroughly understood, but are supposed to be due\r\npartly at least to rapid radiation of heat into the upper regions, as\r\nthe clear atmosphere which usually attends areas of high pressure is\r\nfavorable to such a condition. Undoubtedly, too, there are dynamic\r\ncauses, forcing the colder air from the upper regions to the earth, when\r\nit immediately flows off toward an area of low barometer.\r\n\r\nLong-time predictions are purely guesses. They sometimes guess on the\r\nright side, and this gives them courage to make another. It is an old\r\nsaying that \"all signs fail in dry weather.\" In time of a drought it is\r\ntrue that the indications which at ordinary times would be surely\r\nfollowed by a rain are of no value. When a season is once established,\r\neither as a rainy season or a dry season, it is likely to persist in\r\nthis character until a change comes that is produced by the movement of\r\nthe sun in its course northerly and southerly, and the change produced\r\nfrom this cause requires several weeks of time.\r\n\r\nIf accurate weather predictions could be made for a long time in\r\nadvance, or for even a week, they would be of incalculable value. But it\r\nis doubtful if ever this will be brought about, as there are too many\r\nnecessarily hidden factors which enter into the calculations. If\r\nstations could be established all over the oceans with sufficient\r\nfrequency, and an equal number at a sufficient altitude in the air, I\r\nhave no doubt that much that is now mysterious might be made plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHOW DEW IS FORMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nReader, did you ever live in the country? Were you ever awakened early\r\non a summer's morning to \"go for the cows\"? Did you ever wade through a\r\nwheat field in June--or the long grass of a meadow--when the pearly\r\ndewdrops hung in clusters on the bearded grain, shining like brilliants\r\nin the morning sun? Have you not seen the blades of grass studded with\r\ndiamonds more beautiful than any that ever flashed in the dazzling light\r\nof a ballroom? If not, you have missed a picture that otherwise would\r\nhave been hung on the walls of your memory, that no one could rob you\r\nof.\r\n\r\nEveryone has noticed that at certain times in the year the grass becomes\r\nwet in the evening and grows more so till the sun rises the next day and\r\ndispels the moisture, and this when no cloud is seen. Dew is as old as\r\nthe fields in which grass grows. It was as familiar to the ancients as\r\nit is to us, and yet it is only about three-quarters of a century since\r\nthe cause of it has been understood. We even yet speak of the dew\r\n\"falling\" like rain. In former times some scientists supposed that it\r\nwas a fine rain that fell from the higher regions of the atmosphere.\r\nOthers supposed it to be an emanation from the earth, while still others\r\nsupposed it was an exudation from the stars.\r\n\r\n     \"By his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds\r\n     drop down dew\" (Prov. iii. 20).\r\n\r\nThe first experiments carried on in a scientific way were by Dr. Wells,\r\na physician of London, between the years 1811 and 1814.\r\n\r\nEveryone has noticed in warm weather the familiar phenomenon of water\r\ncondensed into drops on the outside of a pitcher or tumbler containing\r\ncold water. This condensation is dew. It always forms when the\r\nconditions are right, summer and winter. In cold weather we call it\r\nfrost. It has been stated in a former chapter on evaporation that the\r\ncapacity of the air for holding moisture in a transparent form depends\r\nupon its temperature. If the temperature is at the freezing point it\r\nwill contain the 160th part of the atmosphere's own weight as aqueous\r\nvapor. If it is 60 degrees Fahrenheit the air will retain six grains of\r\ntransparent moisture to the square foot of air, while at 80 degrees it\r\nwill contain nearly eleven grains. When the air is charged with this\r\nvapor to the point of saturation (which point varies with the\r\ntemperature) a slight depression of the temperature is sufficient to\r\ncondense this vapor into cloud or drops of water. Between 1812 and 1814\r\nDr. Wells made a series of experiments with flocks of cotton wool. He\r\nweighed out pieces of equal weight and attached a number of them to the\r\nupper side of a board and as many more to the lower side, and exposed it\r\nto the night air under varying conditions. One experiment was made with\r\na board four feet from the earth, so that half of the bunches of cotton\r\nfaced the ground and the other half the sky. He found upon weighing\r\nthese after a night's exposure under a clear sky that the cotton wool on\r\ntop of the board had gained fourteen grains in weight from the moisture,\r\nor dew, that had formed upon it, while the same amount of cotton on the\r\nunder side of the board had only increased four grains. He tried further\r\nexperiments by making little paper houses, or boxes, to cover a certain\r\nportion of grass or vegetation. He found that while there would be a\r\nheavy dew on the grass outside there was little or none within the\r\ninclosure. These experiments were conducted in various ways and closely\r\nwatched to see that none of the phenomena were in any way connected with\r\nfalling rain. It has been determined that substances like grass and\r\ngreen leaves of all kinds, hay and straw, while they are poor\r\nconductors of heat, are excellent radiators. In another chapter we have\r\nreferred to this quality of straw, that is taken advantage of by the\r\ninhabitants of hot countries in the manufacture of ice and in our own\r\nland for storing it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps everyone who has lived in the country has noticed that on a\r\nsummer's morning when the grass is laden with dewdrops a gravel walk or\r\na dusty road will be perfectly dry. This is due to the fact that the\r\ngravel will retain heat and not radiate it, for a much longer time than\r\ngrass or green leaves. Dew begins to form upon the grass very soon after\r\nthe sun is set because the moment the sun's rays are withdrawn the heat\r\nis rapidly radiated by the blades of grass, which cools the earth under\r\nit and the air above and surrounding it, so that if the air is anywhere\r\nnear the moisture saturation point on cooling at the surface of the\r\nground it will readily give up a part of its moisture, which condenses\r\nin drops upon the blades of grass.\r\n\r\nIf the night is still and clear and there is much moisture in the air,\r\nthe dew will be heavy, but if the night is cloudy there will be little\r\nor no dew formed. The clouds form a screen between the earth and the\r\nupper regions of the atmosphere, which prevents the heat from radiating\r\nto a sufficient extent to form dew. For the same reason no dew will\r\nform under a light covering spread over the ground even at some distance\r\nabove it. The covering acts as a screen, which prevents the heat from\r\nradiating to the dew point. From what has gone before it will be seen\r\nthat if the atmosphere is not charged with moisture up to the point of\r\nsaturation it will require a greater amount of depression of temperature\r\nto cause condensation, and this is why we usually have heavier dews in\r\nJune when the air is more highly charged with moisture than we do in\r\nAugust when it is dry. This also accounts for the ice clouds, called\r\ncirrus, being formed so high up in the atmosphere during dry weather.\r\nThere is so little moisture in the air that it requires a very great\r\ndifference of temperature to cause condensation to take place, and the\r\nnecessary depression is not reached in these cases except at an altitude\r\nof several miles.\r\n\r\nDr. Wells has shown that if we take the reading of two thermometers on a\r\nclear summer night, one of them lying on the grass and the other\r\nsuspended two feet above it, we shall find that the one lying on the\r\ngrass will read 8 or 10 degrees lower than the one suspended in the air.\r\nIf the night is still there will be a cold stratum of air next to the\r\nearth, which will not tend to diffuse itself to a very great degree and\r\ndew will form. If, however, it is cloudy or the wind is blowing there is\r\nrarely any formation of dew. The reason in the former case, as we have\r\nexplained, is that the radiated heat is held down to the earth in a\r\nmeasure, and in the latter case there is a constant change of air; so\r\nthat in either case no part of it is allowed to cool down sufficiently\r\nto precipitate moisture.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that often there will be a heavier dew under the\r\nblaze of a full moon on a clear night than at any other time. The moon\r\nhas no screens about it of any kind to obstruct the free radiation of\r\nheat. It is supposed to be a dead cinder floating in space and not\r\nsurrounded by an atmosphere, so that the sun's rays have full effect\r\nupon it during the time it is exposed to them, and at that time it\r\nbecomes heated to a temperature of something like 750 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. For half the month, say, the sun is shining continuously\r\nupon all or a part of it. In other words, the days and nights of the\r\nmoon are about two weeks long. The moon does not revolve upon its own\r\naxis like the earth, therefore the same side or a portion of it is\r\nexposed to the sun for 14 days. During the time that the moon is in the\r\nearth's shadow it is supposed to fall to 187 degrees below zero, which\r\nis 219 degrees below the freezing point. When the moon is full and is\r\nheated up to over 700 degrees there is sufficient heat radiating from it\r\nto be felt sensibly upon the face of the earth, and it would be felt if\r\nit were not for the great envelope of atmosphere and its attendant cloud\r\nformations that surround the earth. There are but few days in summer\r\nwhen there is not a haze in the atmosphere, although we call the sky\r\nclear, which intensifies the light and gives everything a warmer tone.\r\nThe heat coming from a full moon on a clear night is absorbed in causing\r\nthe aqueous vapors that are partly condensed in the higher regions of\r\nthe atmosphere, to be reabsorbed into transparent vapor. This clears\r\naway the heat screen in the atmosphere and allows radiation to go on\r\nmore rapidly at the earth's surface, and thus cools it to a greater\r\nextent when the moon is shining brightly than when it is dark and in the\r\nshadow of the earth.\r\n\r\nAs we have already mentioned, the cold that is produced by radiation\r\nthrough the blades of grass and other radiating substances may be\r\nindicated by placing one thermometer on the ground and fixing another at\r\nsome point in the air. Sometimes the difference is very marked,\r\namounting to as much as 20 or 30 degrees. If under these conditions a\r\ncloud floats overhead, forming a heat screen, its presence will be\r\nreadily noticed by a rise in the thermometer. Radiation into the upper\r\nregions of the atmosphere is checked, which causes a sudden rise in the\r\ntemperature near the surface of the earth. By taking advantage of this\r\nprinciple of heat radiation from the earth's surface it is a very easy\r\nmatter to protect tender vegetation from even quite a severe frost, if\r\nit occurs in the early fall, by a slight covering, such as thin paper.\r\nThe paper will act as a heat screen and in a measure prevent the heat\r\nfrom radiating from the earth immediately under it. Frost--which of\r\ncourse is but frozen dew--at this season of the year will form on a\r\nstill autumn night, although the atmosphere at some distance above the\r\nground is some degrees above the freezing point. The reason for this\r\nwill be obvious when we consider the facts that have been set forth\r\nconcerning the power of radiation to produce cold.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated by meteorologists that the amount of water\r\ncondensed upon the surface of the earth in the form of dew amounts to as\r\nmuch as five inches, or about one-seventh of the whole amount of\r\nmoisture that is evaporated into the air. It will thus be seen that dew\r\nperforms an important part in supporting vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe same operation in nature's great workshop that forms the dews of\r\nsummer creates the frosts of winter. The moisture in cold weather is\r\ncondensed the same as in warm. When it is condensed at the surface of\r\nthe earth we have the phenomenon of frost, but when condensed in the\r\nupper regions of the atmosphere we have that of snow.\r\n\r\nHeat radiation from the earth goes on in winter, which is evidenced by\r\nthe fact that a thick covering of snow is a great benefit to vegetation\r\nas a protection against the injurious effects of frost. The writer has\r\nseen flowers blooming abundantly at an altitude of 12,000 feet above the\r\nsea-level, protected only by the friendly shelter of a snowbank. In some\r\ncases the blooming flowers were in actual contact with the snow. By\r\nexperiment it has been determined that the earth under a thick coating\r\nof snow is usually warmer by nine or ten degrees than the air\r\nimmediately above the snow covering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nHAILSTONES AND SNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hailstone is a curious formation of snow and ice, and most of the\r\nlarge hailstones are conglomerate in their composition. They are usually\r\ncomposed of a center of frozen snow, packed tightly and incased in a rim\r\nof ice, and upon this rim are irregular crystalline formations jutting\r\nout in points at irregular distances. Frequently, however, we find them\r\nvery symmetrically formed as to outline, and the snow centers are almost\r\nwithout exception round. Hailstones and hailstorms differ in different\r\nclimates, but they are more pronounced in the torrid than in the\r\ntemperate zone. Historians give accounts of hailstones of enormous size;\r\nthe very large hailstones being undoubtedly aggregations of single\r\nstones that have been thrown together and congealed in the clouds during\r\ntheir fall to the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that on July 4, 1819, hailstones fell at Baconniere\r\nmeasuring fifteen inches in circumference, and very symmetrically\r\nformed, with beautiful outline. Hailstones in India are said to be very\r\nlarge--from five to twenty times larger than those in England or\r\nAmerica--seldom less than walnuts and often as large as oranges and\r\npumpkins. It is recorded that in 1826, during a hailstorm at Candeish,\r\nthe stones perforated the roofs of houses like cannon shot, and that a\r\nsingle mass fell that required several days to melt, weighing over 100\r\npounds. It is further recorded that on May 8, 1832, a conglomerate mass\r\nof hailstones fell in Hungary a yard in length and nearly two feet in\r\nthickness. Still another instance is recorded of a hailstone having\r\nfallen in 1849 of nearly twenty feet in circumference. This hailstone is\r\nsaid to have fallen upon the estate of Mr. Moffat of Ord. We will only\r\nask our readers to listen to one more hailstone story, in which it is\r\nrelated that during the reign of Tippoo, sultan, a hailstone fell as\r\nlarge as an elephant. Undoubtedly one of two things was true regarding\r\nthis latter story; it was either a very large hailstone or a very small\r\nelephant. The historian fails to give the size of the elephant. There is\r\nno doubt, however, but that hailstones may adhere and form large masses\r\nowing to the violent agitation of the elements that always attends a\r\nhailstorm.\r\n\r\nHailstorms are almost universally attended by constant and heavy thunder\r\nand lightning, together with violent winds. They usually occur on a\r\nvery hot day, and when the air is filled to saturation with moisture.\r\nWhen this is the case a column of air is very highly heated at some\r\npoint, when it ascends with great force into the upper regions of the\r\natmosphere to a greater altitude than is common in the case of ordinary\r\nthunderstorms. Here it meets with an intensely cold body of air, when it\r\nis suddenly condensed and readily frozen as soon as condensed, which not\r\nonly forms hailstones, but sets free the energy that has been carried up\r\nin the moisture globules. This results in frequent electrical\r\ndischarges, causing great waves of condensed and rarefied air, which, in\r\nthe rarefied portions, produces still more intense cold; so that we have\r\nthe conditions for a mighty struggle between the elements, which is\r\nintensified by a constant and terrific electric cannonade. Undoubtedly\r\nthere are also whirlwinds in the cloud, similar to those that sometimes\r\nvisit the earth, which would tend to gather up the hailstones and\r\naggregate them into large masses. It is a mighty battle between the\r\nmoisture-laden, superheated air, ascending from the surface of the\r\nearth, and the powers residing in the upper regions of cold. Nature is\r\nconstantly struggling to find an equilibrium of her forces, and a\r\nhailstorm is only one of the little domestic flurries that take place\r\nwhen she is setting her house to rights. Hailstorms are usually\r\nconfined to very narrow limits, and they can prevail on a grand scale\r\nonly in hot climates, where we have the conditions for wide differences\r\nof temperature between the upper and lower regions of the atmosphere;\r\nand, also, where the conditions are favorable, for an enormous amount of\r\nabsorption of moisture into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhen snow is formed in the atmosphere, the conditions are quite\r\ndifferent from those of a hailstorm; it is usually in a lower plane of\r\nthe atmosphere, and there is no violent commotion, as is the case with\r\nthe latter. A volume of air laden with moisture comes in contact with a\r\ncolder volume of air, when condensation takes place, as in the case of\r\nrain, except that the moisture is immediately frozen. In this case both\r\nvolumes of air may be below the freezing point, but one is very much\r\ncolder than the other. If the snow reaches the earth it will be because\r\nthe air is below the freezing point all the way down. Snow is formed at\r\nall seasons of the year. We may have a snowstorm on a high mountain when\r\nwe have extreme heat at sea-level.\r\n\r\nIn summer time of course the snow melts as soon as it falls into a\r\nstratum of air with a temperature above the freezing point, and\r\ncontinues its journey from that point as raindrops instead of\r\nsnowflakes. In the formation of a snowflake Nature does some of her\r\nmost beautiful work. A snowflake first forms with six ice spangles,\r\nradiating from a common center. Shorter ones form on these six spokes,\r\nstanding at an angle of about sixty degrees, on each side of each spoke,\r\nof such length and arrangement as to form a symmetrical figure or\r\nflower. They do not always take the same form, but follow the same laws\r\nthat govern the formation of ice crystals. The structure of a snowflake\r\nmay be often found upon a window pane of a frosty morning. Here,\r\nhowever, the free arrangement of the parts of a snow crystal are\r\ninterfered with by its contact with the window pane, but while floating\r\ngently in the air there is the utmost freedom for the play of nature's\r\nforces as they apply to the work of crystallization.\r\n\r\nThe difference in structure of snowflakes is chiefly due to the\r\nconditions under which they are formed. If the moisture is frozen too\r\nrapidly the molecular forces that are active in crystallization do not\r\nhave time to carry out the work, in its completeness of detail, as it\r\nwill where the freezing process, as well as the condensing process, goes\r\non more slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMETEORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteors are the tramps of interplanetary space. They sometimes try to\r\nsteal a ride on the surface of the earth, but meet with certain\r\ndestruction the moment they come within the aerial picket line of our\r\nworld's defense against these wandering vagrants of the air. They have\r\nmade many attempts to take this earth by storm, as it were, and many\r\nmore will be made. They fire their missiles at us by the millions every\r\nyear with a speed that is incredible, but thanks to the protecting\r\ninfluence of the great ocean of air that envelops our globe they become\r\nthe victims of their own velocity.\r\n\r\nMeteors or shooting stars are as old as the earth itself, and they are\r\nthe material of which comets are made. Before it was determined what\r\nthese meteors or shooting stars were, many theories were promulgated as\r\nto their origin. One was that they were masses of matter, large and\r\nsmall, projected by volcanic action from the face of the moon with such\r\nviolence as to be brought within the attraction of the earth. Others\r\nsupposed them to be the effect of certain phosphoric fluids that\r\nemanated from the earth and took fire in the upper regions of the\r\natmosphere. This, however, was mere speculation and without any\r\nscientific basis of fact. Anyone who has been an observer of shooting\r\nstars will have learned that there are certain periods of the year when\r\nthey are more numerous than at other times; notably in August and\r\nNovember. Then again there are longer periods of many years apart. By\r\npersistent observation it has been established that there are great\r\nnumbers of schools or collections of cosmic matter that fly through\r\ninterplanetary space, having definite orbits like the planets. Any one\r\nof these collections may be scattered through millions of miles in\r\nlength. A comet is simply one of these wandering collections of meteoric\r\nstones having a nucleus or center where the particles are so condensed\r\nas to give it a reflecting surface something like the planets or the\r\nmoon. This enables us to see the outline of the comet to the point where\r\nthe fragments of matter become so scattered that they are no longer able\r\nto reflect sufficient light to reach our eyes. The fringe of a comet,\r\nhowever, may extend thousands or even millions of miles beyond the\r\nborders of luminosity.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a day or night in the year when more or less of these\r\nmeteoric stones do not come within the region of our atmosphere, and\r\nwhen this happens the great velocity at which they travel is the means\r\nof their own destruction. They become intensely heated by friction\r\nagainst the atmosphere just as a bullet will when fired from a gun--only\r\nto a greater extent owing to the greater velocity. They disintegrate\r\ninto dust which floats in the air for a time, when more or less of it is\r\nprecipitated upon the surface of the earth. Disintegrated meteors, or\r\nstar dust, as they are sometimes called, are often brought down by the\r\nrain or snow. Most of the shooting stars that we observe are very small,\r\nresembling fire-flies in the sky, but once in a while a very large one\r\nis seen moving across the face of the heavens, giving off brilliant\r\nscintillations that trail behind the meteor, making a luminous path that\r\nis visible for some seconds. These brilliant manifestations are due to\r\none of two causes. Either there is a very large mass of incandescent\r\nmatter or else they are so much nearer to us than in ordinary cases that\r\nthey appear larger. It is more likely, however, that it is due to the\r\nformer cause rather than the latter, from the fact of its apparently\r\nslow movement as compared with the smaller shooting stars. It has been\r\ndetermined by observation that the average meteor becomes visible at a\r\npoint less than 100 miles above the earth's surface. It was found as far\r\nback as 1823 that out of 100 shooting stars twenty-two of them had an\r\nelevation of over twenty-four and less than forty miles; thirty-five,\r\nbetween forty and fifty miles; and thirteen between seventy and eighty\r\nmiles. It was determined by Professor Herschel that out of sixty\r\nobservations of shooting stars the average height of their first\r\nappearance was seventy-eight miles and their disappearance was at a\r\npoint fifty-three miles above the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of history, however, that sometimes these meteoric stones\r\ndescend to the surface of the earth before they are entirely\r\ndisintegrated. A fine specimen of this kind is to be seen in the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. There are over forty specimens of these\r\naerolites (air-stones) in the British Museum, labeled with the times and\r\nplaces of their fall. Instances of falling to the earth are so rare that\r\nthere is little to fear from these wandering missiles of the air. We do\r\nnot remember a case where life or property has suffered from the fall of\r\na meteor.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the consideration of the part which the great air\r\nenvelope surrounding the earth plays as a protection against many\r\noutside influences. For instance, if it were not for the air, millions\r\nof these meteoric stones would be showered upon our earth every year and\r\nat certain times every day, which would render the earth untenable for\r\nhuman existence. We should be at the mercy of those wandering comets\r\nwhose fringes strike our atmosphere more or less deeply at frequent\r\nintervals. It is not impossible that the earth may at some time pass\r\ndirectly through one, and yet there is little danger that in such a case\r\nthere would be more than an unusual display of celestial fireworks.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts that have been above stated it will be apparent to anyone\r\nthat the number of these meteoric stones in the air is being constantly\r\nreduced by their constant collision with the atmosphere and consequent\r\nreduction to ashes or dust. Another conclusion is that the earth must be\r\ngradually, but imperceptibly perhaps, increasing in size on account of\r\nthe constant settling upon its surface of meteoric dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE SKY AND ITS COLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the chapters on light in Vol. II. it will be stated that we see all\r\nobjects by a reflected light, except those that are self-luminous, such\r\nas the sun or any other source of light. We see the moon and many of the\r\nplanets entirely by reflection. There are myriads of smaller objects,\r\ntoo small to be seen as such, even under a microscope, that still have a\r\npower to reflect light that is sensible to our vision. The air\r\nsurrounding the globe is literally filled with these microscopic light\r\nreflectors. They serve to give us a diffused light which enables us to\r\nsee clearly all visible objects. We have all noticed the effect of a\r\nsingle electric arc light, situated at a distance from any other source\r\nof light, and how it casts extremely dark shadows and very high lights;\r\nso much so that it is difficult to see an object perfectly in this\r\nlight, because the part of an object that is under the direct rays of\r\nthe lamp is so highly illuminated that the shadow, by comparison, has\r\nthe effect of simply a dark blot without form or shape. Many of you\r\nhave noticed in a country village, where the streets are lighted with\r\nelectric arc lamps, what a difference there is in the illuminating\r\neffect between a clear and a foggy night. When there is a fog, or when\r\nthe clouds hang low down, we get a reflection from these which tends to\r\ndiffuse and soften the powerful light rays that are sent out by these\r\nlamps. This effect is especially noticeable when the night is only\r\nmoderately foggy. Each globule of moisture floating in the air becomes a\r\nreflector of light, and by myriads of reflections and counter\r\nreflections the light (which on a clear night is concentrated) is\r\ndiffused over a large area, producing an illumination which for\r\npractical purposes is far superior to that produced on a clear night.\r\nWhen the latter condition prevails the rays of light are so intense on\r\nobjects immediately surrounding the lamps that one is blinded; so that\r\nthe places which are in shadow seem darker than they would be if there\r\nwere no light at all. The only way to prevent this effect is to have the\r\nlights so close together that there will be cross lights, which tend to\r\nbreak up the intensity of the shadows. This principle of light diffusion\r\nis taken advantage of to produce an even illumination in stores that are\r\nlighted only on one or two sides. This is effected by a series of prisms\r\nor reflecting surfaces that are cast upon the panes of glass.\r\n\r\nIf now there were no atmosphere--or, to state it differently--if there\r\nwere no floating substances in the atmosphere, the sun would produce an\r\neffect upon the earth similar to that of a single electric light. The\r\nlights would be extremely high, and the shadows extremely dense. To one\r\nlooking off into space, the sky, instead of having the blue appearance\r\nthat we see, would have the effect of looking into a deep, dark abyss\r\nwithout illumination.\r\n\r\nTyndall has shown us by a beautiful experiment that if there be in a\r\nglass tube a mixture of gases related to each other in a certain way\r\nchemically, they will combine into small globules or particles similar\r\nto moisture in the air. If now a beam of light is thrown upon this tube\r\nand a dark screen put behind it, we shall, in the beginning of the\r\nexperiment, simply see the dark screen. As soon, however, as the\r\nmolecules of the gases have combined in sufficient numbers to produce\r\nparticles of sensible size we begin to have a reflection of light from\r\nthem, the color of which is constantly changing as the combining\r\nparticles grow in size. At a certain stage in its progress the color\r\nwhich the mixture of gases assumes is a beautiful azure blue, rivaling\r\nin purity the finest skies of Greece or southern Italy.\r\n\r\nThe sun is the great lamp that illuminates the world, while the\r\natmosphere, which is filled with particles of various substances,\r\nbecomes the shade of the lamp which diffuses and softens the light and\r\ngives it its color tones, whether of warmth or coldness. We could not\r\nwell do without the reflected light of the sky. The poetry of life would\r\nbe sadly marred. The beautiful effects of color and purity of tone would\r\nbe wanting. We need to bathe in light as much as in water, and the\r\ncharacter of the light is almost as important as the character of the\r\nwater. Imagine a world with an atmosphere devoid of all substances that\r\nwould in any way reflect light or give to it softness or color tone.\r\nImagine a sun or a moon without visible rays--for without a reflecting\r\natmosphere there would be none. Imagine a sky that was no sky at all,\r\nbut only a dark void, with no protecting vault. Think of the shadows, so\r\ndark that you could see nothing in them. These would be some of the\r\neffects that would come from an atmosphere that had no sky substance in\r\nit. Imagine the world lighted by one great arc light. The reflex action\r\nupon the race living in such a light would be anything but desirable.\r\nThe world would develop into an arc-light civilization--if one can\r\nimagine what that would be like; certainly one of intensely violent\r\ncontrasts. Look on this picture and let us be thankful for the blue sky\r\nand golden sunsets.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" you ask, \"why is the sky blue?\"\r\n\r\nIn one of the chapters on the subject of light in Vol. II. the\r\nproperties of soap bubbles are discussed. It is shown that when a film\r\nis stretched across the mouth of a tumbler held in a position so that\r\nthe film is perpendicular, by the action of gravity (the moisture\r\nconstantly falling to the lower part of the film) it will continually\r\ngrow thinner, and horizontal bands of color will appear upon it,--first\r\nred, then followed by the other colors of the solar spectrum, ending\r\nwith violet.\r\n\r\nIt is also stated that every color of light has a definite wave length.\r\nWhere a band of blue color appears upon the film we know that its\r\nthickness is right for the wave length of that particular color which is\r\nreflected from the back of the film to the eye. If we could conceive the\r\nblue vault of the heavens to be half a sphere of a soap bubble, the\r\ncolor that the sky would appear to us (if the light could be thrown upon\r\nit from beneath) would be determined by the thickness of this film. If\r\nthe film was 1-156,000 of an inch the sky would be red instead of blue.\r\nTo reflect the other colors the film would have to grow thinner for each\r\ncolor, in the progression from red to violet. The color of the sky is\r\ndetermined by a light-reflection from minute globules of moisture\r\nfloating in the air. If the sky is blue, then the globules must be of\r\nthe right diameter to reflect that color. The various tints and\r\ncolorings of the sky are determined by what is found in the atmosphere,\r\nand this is the reason why skies differ in coloring and tone in\r\ndifferent sections of the globe. The finest skies are probably found in\r\nsemi-tropical regions like southern Italy, Greece, and California.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 I visited Greece in the early part of June. In crossing the\r\nAdriatic, from Brindisi to Patras in Greece, the route was through the\r\nIonian Islands that are grouped along the southwestern shore of Albania.\r\nThe sky was without a cloud, and its beautiful blue color was reflected\r\nin the waters of the Adriatic, and I never shall forget the impression\r\nmade upon my senses when we first came in sight of the mountains on the\r\nwest coast of Albania. At this point they rise abruptly from the water\r\nand are colored with that peculiar azure haze, mixed with a shading of\r\nwarmth, which is an effect that distance gives in the classic atmosphere\r\nof old Greece. The effect upon the beholder is to intoxicate the senses\r\nand to fill him with that deliciously poetic feeling that always comes\r\nwhen standing in the presence of the sublime in nature. It was not the\r\nmountains themselves that produced the effect, for I had seen grander\r\nthan these; but it was the sky on the mountains. When we look at a\r\ndistant mountain it seems to be partly hidden by a peculiar haze that is\r\nthe color of the sky at that time; we are really looking at the mountain\r\nthrough a portion of the sky. While in Athens I took a trip to the top\r\nof Mount Pentelicus, which separates the plains of Athens on the south\r\nfrom those of Marathon on the north. From the summit of this mountain we\r\nhave a most wonderful view of the archipelago of the AEgean Sea--a\r\nbeautiful map of blue water and brown islands that melt together in the\r\ndistance. At our feet lay the historic plains of Marathon, and in the\r\ndistance rose the snow-capped peaks of Mount Olympus. It is doubtful if\r\nthe world furnishes a more beautiful combination of ocean, island,\r\ncontinent, and sky than can be seen from Mount Pentelicus. Myriads of\r\nbrown islands set in the bluest of water--graceful in outline and\r\nmultiform in shape--jutting headlands and land-locked harbors--strong in\r\ncolor and outline in the immediate foreground, but gradually melting\r\ntogether in the distance, the brown becoming bluer and the blue a softer\r\nblue till the whole is lost on the horizon in a sky that shades back to\r\nthe zenith in an ever-changing azure that for purity of tone baffles all\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder that a people born under such skies and whose eyes have\r\nfeasted on such beauties in nature should conceive and execute such a\r\nmasterful work of art as the Parthenon! While the variation of\r\nlandscape, the stretch of water filled with islands, and the mountains\r\ncapped with eternal snow were a prominent part of the picture, it was\r\nthe sky with its beautiful color-tones that after all gave it its\r\nwonderful charm.\r\n\r\nThe skies in a northern latitude are colder and grayer, due to the fact\r\nthat nearly always there is a certain degree of condensation of moisture\r\nexisting, which, while it does not take the form of a cloud, still gives\r\na toning to the sky.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that the color-tones of the sky have an influence\r\nupon the character and temperament of the people who live under them.\r\nUnder semi-tropical skies the poetic nature is more strongly appealed\r\nto, and a man is more likely to be controlled by his dreamy imaginings\r\nthan his cold calculations. We find this latter characteristic\r\nprevailing to a greater or less extent among the people who live under\r\ncolder and sterner skies. If all these qualities or influences could be\r\ncombined in the right way, the race would be stronger intellectually and\r\nin other ways. It is always dangerous to a race of people to be\r\ndeveloped along certain lines only. The development should be\r\nsymmetrical. The strongest men are not those who are simply coldly\r\nintellectual, neither those who are simply emotional and sentimental,\r\nbut those in whom heart, mind, and soul are so related that each one of\r\nthese elements re-enforces and strengthens the others.\r\n\r\nAt certain seasons of the year and in certain localities it is not\r\nuncommon to have wonderfully beautiful displays of coloring upon the\r\nskies and clouds at sunset. The question is often asked why we do not\r\nsee these displays at other times in the day than at sunrise and at\r\nsunset--for the same effects are seen in the morning, but they are not\r\nnoticed so often, because to do so would interfere with the habits of\r\nthe average man and woman.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this change of coloring is the angle at which the sun's\r\nrays strike the clouds of an evening sky, which are reflected to our\r\neyes. When the sun is high in the heavens it shines against the back of\r\nthe clouds, from the point of view of a person standing on the surface\r\nof the earth. It also shines a shorter distance through the air at\r\nmidday than at sunset. At sunset the rays are able to shine on the under\r\nside of a cloud, especially if it is high in the air. The moisture\r\nglobules of which the cloud is made up are much larger than the\r\ntransparent ones that are uncondensed and just as they were when\r\nreleased in the process of evaporation.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the reflections from these minute globules\r\ngive us the blue coloring of the sky and are very much smaller in\r\ndiameter than a globule that is able to reflect the red ray. When these\r\nsmall globules are condensed into cloud a great number are combined into\r\none globule, and they are of all sizes, from the globule of evaporation\r\nto that of the raindrop when precipitation takes place. We have, then,\r\nin the various stages of cloud formation all conditions present for\r\nreflecting the various colors and combinations of colors that are found\r\nin the solar spectrum. Hence it is that, under certain conditions of\r\natmosphere and cloud formation, we see at sunset painted upon the sky\r\nthose wonderful combinations of colors, more beautiful and delicate in\r\nshading, more various in combination and purer of tone, than any artist,\r\nhowever cunning his fingers or brilliant his pigments, has ever been\r\nable to truthfully reproduce. Even when the sky is cloudless it often\r\nassumes a brilliant hue, which is partly a reflection from invisible\r\nmoisture globules and partly due to floating particles of dust that may\r\nhave been driven up from the surface of the earth, or may be the ashes\r\nof meteorites disintegrated by contact with the air.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, commencing in August, 1883, there was a wonderful\r\nexhibition of red skies at sunset that lasted for several hours after\r\ntwilight ordinarily disappears. This phenomenon ran through a period of\r\nseveral weeks, gradually fading away. It was afterward determined that\r\nthese displays were occasioned by small particles of ashes or dust\r\nfloating high in the air, that were thrown off from the volcanic\r\neruption of Krakatoa in the Island of Java. By the general circulation\r\nof the air the ashes were carried to all parts of the world, making a\r\ncircuit of the earth in from twelve to thirteen days--which showed a\r\nvelocity of over eighty miles an hour. This is an instance of the high\r\nvelocity of the air currents in the upper regions of the atmosphere. The\r\nreason why the illumination extended so late in the night was because of\r\nthe great height that these particles of dust attained. The higher the\r\nreflecting surfaces are in the air the longer they may be seen after\r\nsunset. Ordinary twilight is caused by a reflection of sunlight from the\r\nupper air; and from its duration as ordinarily observed it is estimated\r\nthat the reflection does not proceed from a point more than thirty-six\r\nmiles high. In the higher latitudes the twilight is long, from the fact\r\nthat the sun does not go directly down, and if we go far enough north\r\nthe whole night is twilight. In the tropical regions the twilight is\r\nshorter than at any other point on the globe for reasons that are\r\nobvious. The sun there goes directly down and is soon hidden behind the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThere are other optical effects to be seen sometimes on the horizon\r\nsomewhat resembling twilight. The \"aurora borealis\" (northern lights),\r\nwhich we describe in Vol. III., is seen in the northern skies at certain\r\ntimes, and has very much the appearance of twilight in some of its\r\nphases. It is constantly changing, however, and is easily distinguished\r\nby anyone who has observed both. These appearances are undoubtedly\r\nelectrical. There is another phenomenon seen in the arctic regions that\r\ncauses a band of white light to appear on the horizon called \"ice\r\nblink,\" and it is caused by the reflections from the great icebergs that\r\nabound in that region.\r\n\r\nCurious optical effects are sometimes observed a little after sunset in\r\nthe form of streamers or bands of light that shoot up into the sky,\r\nsometimes to a great height. These are undoubtedly due to cloud\r\nobstructions that partially shut off the sun's rays from a part of the\r\nsky, but allow it to shine with greater brilliancy in the path of these\r\nbands of light.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing that the sky in all of its phases is\r\na product of sunlight and the substances that float in the air,\r\nincluding moisture, not only in the invisible state, but in all the\r\nstages of condensation, as well as particles of floating dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nLIQUID AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir, like water, assumes the liquid form at a certain temperature. Water\r\nboils and vaporizes at 212 degrees Fahrenheit above zero, while liquid\r\nair boils and vaporizes at 312 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nHeat and cold are practically relative terms, although scientists talk\r\nabout an \"absolute zero\" (the point of no heat), and Professor Dewar\r\nfixes this point at 461 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. Others have\r\nestimated that the force of the moon during its long night of half a\r\nmonth, is reduced in temperature to six or seven hundred degrees below,\r\nwhich is far lower than Professor Dewar's absolute zero. However this\r\nmay be, to an animal that is designed to live in a temperature of 70 or\r\n80 degrees Fahrenheit, any temperature below zero would seem very cold.\r\nIf, however, we were adapted to a climate where the normal temperature\r\nwas 312 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, we should be severely burned if\r\nwe should sit down upon a cake of ice. Such a climate would be\r\nimpossible for animal existence, for the reason that there would be no\r\nair to breathe, since it would all liquefy.\r\n\r\nLiquid air is not a natural product. There is no place on our earth cold\r\nenough to produce it. If the moon had an atmosphere (which it probably\r\nhas not) it would liquefy during the long lunar night, for heat radiates\r\nvery rapidly from a planet when the sun's rays are withdrawn from it.\r\n\r\nAs you have already surmised, liquid air is a product of intense cold.\r\nAny method that will reduce the temperature of the air to 312 degrees\r\nFahrenheit below zero will liquefy it. Great pressure will not do this,\r\nfor we may compress air in a strong vessel until the pressure on every\r\nsquare inch of the vessel is 12,000 pounds, or six tons, and still it\r\nwill not liquefy unless the temperature is brought down to the required\r\ndegree of coldness. If this is done it will change from a gas to a\r\nliquid, but will occupy as much space as before, if it is condensed to a\r\npressure of six tons to the square inch.\r\n\r\nUntil twenty years ago it was supposed that oxygen and atmospheric air\r\n(the latter a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen) were fixed gases and could\r\nnot be liquefied. In 1877, it is said that Raoul Pictet obtained the\r\nfirst liquid oxygen, but only a few drops. About fifteen years later\r\nProfessor Dewar of the Royal Institution, London, succeeded in\r\nliquefying not only oxygen but atmospheric air. And besides liquefying\r\nthe air he made ice of it.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 I visited London, where I met Professor Dewar, who invited me to\r\nwitness an exhibition of the manufacture of liquid oxygen--and\r\nincidentally liquid air--at the Royal Institution. To me it was a most\r\nwonderfully interesting event. I saw air, taken from the room, gradually\r\nliquefy in a small glass test tube open at the top. When the tube was\r\nwithdrawn from the refrigerating chamber it boiled by the heat of the\r\nroom, and rapidly evaporated. We lighted a splinter of wood and blew it\r\nout, leaving a live spark on the end of it, and held it over the mouth\r\nof the tube, knowing that if anything like pure oxygen were evaporating\r\nthe splinter would relight and blaze (an old experiment with oxygen\r\ngas). At first the splinter would not relight, because the evaporating\r\ngases were a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen in the proportions to form\r\nair. But owing to the fact that nitrogen evaporates sooner than oxygen,\r\na second trial was successful, for the splinter immediately began to\r\nblaze, showing that the gas evaporating then was pure, or nearly pure,\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\nWhen the liquid oxygen was poured into a saucer and brought into\r\nproximity with the poles of a powerful magnet the liquid immediately\r\nrushed out of the saucer and clung to the magnet poles; showing that\r\noxygen is magnetic.\r\n\r\nSince that time other experimenters have succeeded in making liquid air\r\non a comparatively large scale, and the process is simple when we\r\nconsider some of the old methods.\r\n\r\nMr. Tripler of New York, who has made liquid air in great quantities,\r\ndoes it substantially as follows: First, he compresses air to about 2500\r\npounds to the square inch. Of course the air is very hot when it is\r\nfirst compressed because all the air in the tank has been reduced in\r\nbulk about 166 times, and all the heat that was in the whole bulk of air\r\nis concentrated into one-166th of the space it occupied before it was\r\ncompressed. It is 166 times hotter. There are two sets of pipes running\r\nfrom the compressor to a long upright tank called the liquefier. These\r\npipes pass through running water, so that the compressed air is quickly\r\ncooled down to the temperature of the water (about 50 degrees\r\nFahrenheit). The pipes--at least one set of them--run the whole length\r\nof the liquefier, and most likely are coiled. This set of pipes contains\r\nthe air to be liquefied. A second set of pipes runs to the bottom of the\r\nliquefier, where there is a valve. By opening this valve a jet of\r\ncompressed air is allowed to play on the other set of pipes, when\r\nintense cold is produced by the sudden expansion of the air. This cold\r\nair rushes up around the pipe containing the air to be liquefied and\r\nescapes at the top, thus absorbing the heat until the temperature is\r\nreduced to 312 degrees below zero. Then the air liquefies and runs into\r\na receptacle, where it may be drawn off at pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that a large part of the compressed air is wasted in\r\ncooling the remainder sufficiently to liquefy.\r\n\r\nThe use to which liquid air may be put, advantageously, is an unsolved\r\nproblem; but no doubt it will have a place in time. All great\r\ndiscoveries do. Electricity had to wait a long time for recognition; but\r\nwhat a part it plays now in the everyday life of the whole civilized\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nCurious effects are produced by this intense cold. Meat may be frozen so\r\nhard that it will give off a musical tone when struck. Here is a pointer\r\nfor the seeker of novelties in the line of musical instruments.\r\n\r\nLiquid air furnishes a beautiful illustration of the fact that a burning\r\ngas jet is continually forming water as well as giving out heat and\r\nlight. If we put liquid air into a tea kettle and hold it over a gas\r\njet, ice will form on the bottom from the water created by the flame,\r\nand it will freeze so hard that the flame will make no impression upon\r\nit, other than to make the ice cake grow larger.\r\n\r\nAlthough liquid air is not found in nature, and is therefore called an\r\nartificial product, it is produced by taking advantage of natural law.\r\nWithout the intellect of man it never would have been seen upon this\r\nearth; and the same may be said concerning many things in our world,\r\nboth animate and inanimate. The genius of man is God-like. He lifts the\r\nveil that shrouds the mysteries of nature, and here he comes in very\r\ntouch with the mind of the Infinite. Man interprets this thought through\r\nthe medium of natural law, and lo, a new product!\r\n\r\nHow much life would have been robbed of its charm and interest if all\r\nthese things had been worked out for us from the beginning! For there is\r\nno interest so absorbing and no pleasure so keen as that of pursuit when\r\nthe pursuer is reaching out after the hidden things that are locked up\r\nin Nature's great storehouse. From time to time she yields up her\r\nsecrets, little by little, to encourage those who love her and are\r\nwilling to work, not only for the pleasure of the getting, but for the\r\nhighest and best good of their fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND FLOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater covers such a large proportion of the earth's surface and is such\r\nan important factor in the economy of nature that it becomes a matter of\r\ninterest to study the process of its distribution. Water is to our globe\r\nwhat blood is to our bodies. A constant circulation must be kept up or\r\nall animal and vegetable life would suffer. Here, as in every other\r\noperation of nature, the sun is the great heart and motive power that is\r\nactive in the distribution of moisture over the face of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe total annual rainfall on the whole surface of the earth amounts to\r\nabout 28,000 cubic miles of water. Only about one-fourth of this amount\r\never reaches the ocean, but it is either absorbed for a time by animal\r\nand vegetable life or lifted through the process of evaporation into the\r\nair as invisible moisture, when it is carried over the region of\r\nrainfall and there condensed into water and falls back upon the\r\nearth--only to go through the same operation again. The whole surface of\r\nthe earth is divided into drainage areas that lead either directly\r\nthrough rivulets and rivers to the ocean, or into some land-locked\r\nbasin, where it either finds an outlet under ground or is kept within\r\nbounds through the process of evaporation, the same as is the case with\r\nour great oceans. In North America the amount of drainage area that has\r\nno outlet to the ocean amounts to about 3 per cent. of the whole\r\nsurface. In other countries the percentage of inland drainage is much\r\nlarger. The great Salt Lake in Utah is an instance where there is no\r\noutlet for the water except through the medium of evaporation. Inasmuch\r\nas all rivers and streams contain a certain proportion of\r\nsalt,--especially in such strongly alkaline land regions as the Great\r\nBasin of the North American continent,--these inland lakes in time\r\nbecome saturated with this and other mineral substances.\r\n\r\nSalt is constantly being carried into the lake by the water of the\r\nstream that feeds it, and the water is continually being evaporated,\r\nleaving the salt behind. This process has been going on in the valley of\r\nUtah for so long a period that 17 per cent. of the contents of the lake\r\nis salt. The Humboldt River in Nevada, which empties into a small lake\r\nof the same name, and lies at the foot of the Humboldt Mountains, is\r\nsaid to have an underground outlet. This must be the case, because the\r\narea of the lake is very small as compared with Salt Lake, while the\r\nriver that feeds the latter is very small compared with the one that\r\nflows into the former. That is to say, in the one case a very small\r\nstream empties into a large lake, while in the other case a much larger\r\nstream feeds a very small lake. Besides, Humboldt Lake, unlike the Great\r\nSalt Lake, is said to be a fresh-water lake; if it had no outlet it\r\nwould become in time saturated with salt. The largest body of water in\r\nthe world having no outlet to the ocean is the Caspian Sea, on the\r\nborder between Asia and Russia in Europe, it being 180,000 square miles\r\nin extent.\r\n\r\nWhere rivers empty into large bodies of water, such as the great chain\r\nof lakes on the northern border of the United States (and these lakes\r\nhave an outlet connecting one with the other, and finally by a river to\r\nthe ocean) a constant circulation is being kept up, and the water\r\nremains fresh. Owing to the fact, however, of the great evaporating\r\nsurface that these lakes afford, there is a greater disproportion\r\nbetween the rainfall upon the drainage area tributary to these lakes,\r\nand the amount of discharge through the St. Lawrence River, than would\r\nbe the case with a river that was not connected with a system of lakes.\r\nThe amount of rainfall upon the area drained by the Mississippi River\r\nduring one year amounts to about 614 cubic miles of water, while the\r\ndischarge at the mouth of the Mississippi River is only about 154 cubic\r\nmiles. The difference between the two figures has been carried up by the\r\nprocess of evaporation or stored in vegetation. These figures vary\r\nconsiderably, however, with different years.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of rainfall to discharge will vary greatly in different\r\nrivers from other causes than having a large evaporating surface. This\r\nvariation is due to the difference in the ability of the soil to retain\r\nwater after a rainfall. In some drainage areas the ground is more or\r\nless impermeable to water, and in this case the water runs readily off,\r\ncausing a sudden rise in the river; and as suddenly it reaches the\r\nlow-water mark. In other drainage areas the ground is very permeable to\r\nwater, so that the rain penetrates to a greater depth into the earth,\r\nwhere it is held, and by a slow process drains into the rivers, while\r\nmuch more of it is carried off by evaporation and into vegetation than\r\nis the case in the drainage district before mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe courses of rivers are determined by the topography of the country\r\nthrough which they flow. The sinuous windings, that are found to be a\r\ncharacteristic of nearly all rivers, are caused by the water, through\r\nthe force of gravity, seeking the lowest level, and avoiding\r\nobstructions, which they can flow around more easily than remove.\r\n\r\nGreat rivers often change their courses, especially where they flow\r\nthrough a region of made earth, such as is the case with the lower\r\nMississippi River, and in other great rivers of the world. The loose\r\nearth is continually shifted by the current, and where the current is\r\nnot very strong it will often hold the water back to such an extent of\r\naccumulated weight that the flood will break over at some weak point on\r\nits banks and make a new course for itself.\r\n\r\nOne of the great rivers of China--the Hwangho--often causes dire\r\ndestruction to life and property owing to change in its bed from time to\r\ntime. It is estimated that between the years of 1851-66 this river\r\ncaused the loss of from 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 lives through drowning\r\nand famine by the destruction of crops.\r\n\r\nFloods in rivers are occasioned from various causes. Of course the\r\nprimary cause is the same in all cases, that is, from precipitation of\r\nmoisture in the form of rain or snow. Some rivers are so related to the\r\narea of rainfall and to the permeability of the soil that there is but\r\nlittle variation in the amount of discharge throughout the year. The\r\ngreat river of South America, the Amazon, is an instance of a river of\r\nthis class. A certain number of the smaller rivers that feed it lie in\r\nthe area of rainfall during the whole of the year; for instance, the\r\nstreams of the upper Amazon are being fed by rains at one season of the\r\nyear, when those feeding the river lower down are at the lowest stage.\r\nWhen the rainy season prevails in the upper section of the river the dry\r\nseason prevails farther down, while at another season of the year these\r\nconditions are reversed. Therefore, though the Amazon has a larger\r\ndrainage basin than any other river in the world, and in some parts the\r\nyearly rainfall is 280 inches, there is no very great fluctuation in the\r\nstages of water. The Orinoco River, which flows through Venezuela, and\r\nwhose drainage area is largely covered with mountains, has a greater\r\nfluctuation than any other river, the difference between high and low\r\nwater amounting to seventy feet.\r\n\r\nThe River Nile has an annual rise of from fourteen to twenty-six feet.\r\nThis river is the sole dependence of the inhabitants of lower Egypt, and\r\ntheir sustenance depends upon the height to which the river rises; if it\r\ndoes not rise high enough the agricultural lands are not sufficiently\r\nirrigated, and if it rises too high their crops are destroyed by the\r\nfloods. In this section they depend entirely upon the overflow of the\r\nNile for irrigation, and not upon the rainfall. There is scarcely ever\r\na rainfall in lower Egypt except about once a year on the coast of the\r\nMediterranean. After ascending the river for a short distance we come\r\ninto an area of no rain for a distance of 1500 miles along the river.\r\nEgypt has a superficial area of about 115,200 square miles, and only\r\nabout one-twelfth of this area is in a position to be cultivated.\r\n\r\nAs there is no rainfall in this region, the sole dependence for\r\nagricultural purposes is from the River Nile when it rises to a\r\nsufficient height to admit of irrigation. The river brings down\r\nquantities of rich earth which during the overflow is deposited, and\r\nthus the agricultural regions are refertilized annually.\r\n\r\nThe River Nile is what is called a tropical river and is fed by the\r\nrains in upper Egypt caused by the monsoon winds that prevail in that\r\nsection of Africa during the summer season, as they do in India. As has\r\nbeen explained in a former chapter, the monsoon winds blow steadily for\r\nabout six months from off the southern ocean. These winds are highly\r\ncharged with moisture, which is not precipitated till it strikes the\r\nmountainous regions of the interior. Here the high mountains, which are\r\noften snow-capped, cause a profuse precipitation, which runs off into\r\nthe various feeders of the Nile, causing a gradual rise in the river\r\nthat reaches the highest point about September of each year. If the\r\nNile should dry up, or if the annual floods should materially change in\r\nheight, it would make a desert region of all that portion of Egypt now\r\nso productive.\r\n\r\nThe great rivers of China, the Yang-tse-Kiang and the Hwangho, are also\r\ntropical rivers and have an annual flood. Sometimes the rise is as much\r\nas fifty-six feet. These annual floods are also caused by the monsoon\r\nwinds that carry moisture from the ocean, which is condensed and\r\nprecipitated in the mountains of central Asia. The conditions are\r\nsubstantially the same as those which prevail at the sources of the Nile\r\nin Africa.\r\n\r\nRivers are produced from all sorts of causes, some of them flowing only\r\nduring the rainy season, while others are fed by melting snow from the\r\nhigher mountains, and as the snow is rarely melted away entirely during\r\nthe summer, in the high mountains, there is a continual flow from this\r\nsource. The snow forms a system of storage, so that the water is held\r\nback and is gradually given up as it melts. If this were not true\r\nmountainous regions would be subjected to disastrous floods. If the\r\nprecipitation were always in the form of rain it would immediately run\r\noff instead of being distributed over a whole season. The Platte is an\r\ninstance of a river largely fed by the melting snows--of the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nIn the region of glaciers in the mountains of Alaska and Switzerland\r\nrivers are fed by the melting ice. These rivers are usually of a milky\r\ncolor occasioned by the pulverization of rock caused by the grinding of\r\nthe great glaciers as they flow down the gulches in the mountain side.\r\nIn some regions these glacial rivers have a diurnal variation. This is\r\ncaused by the fact that the glacier is so situated that it freezes at\r\nnight, which checks the flow, and thaws in the daytime, which increases\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRivers are to the globe what the veins are to the animal organization.\r\nThey pick up the surplus moisture not needed in the growth of vegetation\r\nand for the sustenance of animal life, and carry it on, together with\r\nthe debris that it gathers in its course, to the great reservoirs, the\r\nseas and oceans, where it is redistilled and purified by the action of\r\nthe sun's rays. From here it is carried back in the form of invisible\r\nmoisture and again precipitated in the purified state, to help carry on\r\nthe great operations of growth--animal and vegetable. The vaporized\r\nmoisture that is carried back by the winds and redistributed corresponds\r\nto the blood, after it has been purified and is carried back through the\r\narteries to the extremities and capillary vessels which feed and nourish\r\nthe bodily organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone who has spent a summer at the seashore has observed that the\r\nwater level of the ocean changes twice in about twenty-four hours, or\r\nperhaps it would be a better statement to say that it is continually\r\nchanging and that twice in twenty-four hours there is a point when it\r\nreaches its highest level and another when it reaches its lowest. It\r\nswings back and forth like a pendulum, making a complete oscillation\r\nonce in twelve hours. When we come to study this phenomenon closely we\r\nfind that it varies each day, and that for a certain period of time the\r\nwater will reach a higher level each succeeding day until it culminates\r\nin a maximum height, when it begins to gradually diminish from day to\r\nday until it has reached a minimum. Here it turns and goes over the same\r\nround again. It will be further observed that the time occupied between\r\none high tide and the next one is a trifle over twelve hours. That is to\r\nsay, the two ebbs and flows that occur each day require a little more\r\nthan twenty-four hours, so that the tidal day is a little longer than\r\nthe solar day. It corresponds to what we call the lunar day.\r\n\r\nAs all know, the moon goes through all its phases once in twenty-eight\r\ndays. The tide considered in its simplest aspect is a struggle on the\r\npart of the water to follow the moon. There is a mutual attraction of\r\ngravitation between the earth and the moon. Because the water of the\r\nearth is mobile it tends to pile up at a point nearest the moon. But the\r\nearth as a whole also moves toward the moon, and more than the water\r\ndoes, keeping its round shape, while its movable water (practically\r\nenveloping it) is piled up before it toward the moon and left\r\naccumulated behind it away from the moon. So that in a rough way it is a\r\nsolid sound earth, surrounded by an oval body of water: the long axis of\r\nthe oval representing the high tides, which, as they follow the moon,\r\nslide completely around the earth once in every twenty-four hours. Thus,\r\nthere are really two high tides and two low tides moving around the\r\nearth at the same time; and this accounts for the two daily tides.\r\n\r\nWe have accounted for the time when they occur in the fact that the\r\nwater attempts to follow the moon, but this does not account for the\r\ngradual changes in the amount of fluctuation from day to day. The\r\nproblem is complicated by the fact that the sun also has an attraction\r\nfor the earth as well as the moon. But from the fact that the sun is\r\nsomething like 400 times further from the earth than the moon is, and\r\nalso the fact that the attraction of one body for another varies\r\ninversely as the square of the distance, the moon has an immense\r\nadvantage over the sun, although so much smaller. If the power of the\r\nmoon were entirely suspended, or if the moon were blotted out of\r\nexistence, there would still be a tide. The fluctuation between high and\r\nlow tide would not be nearly so great as it is at present, but it would\r\noccur at the same time each day, because it would be wholly a product of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily seen that these two forces acting upon the water at\r\nthe same time will cause a complicated condition in the movement of the\r\nwaters of the ocean. There will come a time once in twenty-eight days\r\nwhen the sun and the moon will act conjointly, and both will pull in the\r\nsame direction at the same time upon the water. This joint action of the\r\nsun and moon produces the highest tide, which is called the \"spring\"\r\ntide. From this point, however, the tides will grow less each day,\r\nbecause the relation of the sun and moon is constantly changing, owing\r\nto the fact that it requires 365 days for the sun to complete his\r\napparent revolution around the earth, while the moon does her actual\r\ncourse in twenty-eight days. When the sun and moon have changed their\r\nrelative positions so that they are at right angles to each other with\r\nreference to the earth--at a quarter-circle apart--the sun and moon will\r\nbe pulling against each other; at least this is the point where the moon\r\nis at the greatest disadvantage with reference to its ability to attract\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nBecause one-quarter around the earth the sun is creating his own tide,\r\nwhich to that extent counteracts the effect produced by the moon, the\r\ntide under the moon at this point is at its lowest point and is called\r\nthe \"neap\" tide. When the moon has passed on around the earth to a point\r\nwhere it is opposite to that of the sun--at a half-circle apart--there\r\nwill be another spring tide, and then another neap tide when it is on\r\nthe last quarter, and from that point the tide will increase daily until\r\nit reaches the point where the sun and moon are in exact line with\r\nreference to the earth's center, when another spring tide occurs. From\r\nthis it will be seen that there are two spring tides and two neap tides\r\nin each twenty-eight days. This is the fundamental law governing tides.\r\n\r\nThere are many other conditions that modify tidal effects. Neither the\r\nsun nor the moon is always at the same distance from the earth. So that\r\nthere will be a variation at times in high and low tides. For instance,\r\nit will happen sometimes that when both the sun and moon are acting\r\nconjointly they will both be at their nearest point to the earth, and\r\nwhen this is the case the spring tide will be much higher than usual.\r\n\r\nFor many years the writer has observed that artesian wells, made by deep\r\nborings of small diameter into the earth to a water supply, have a daily\r\nperiod of ebb and flow, as well as a neap and spring tide, the same as\r\nthe tides of the ocean, except that the process is reversed. The time of\r\ngreatest flow of an artesian well will occur at low tide in the ocean.\r\nThis might be accounted for from the fact that when the tide is at its\r\nheight the moon is also pulling upon the crust of the earth, which would\r\ntend to take the pressure off the sand rock which lies one or two\r\nthousand feet below the surface and through which the flow of water\r\ncomes, and thus slacken the flow. When the moon is in position for low\r\ntide, the crust of the earth would settle back and thus produce a\r\ngreater pressure upon the water-bearing rock. This is the only theory\r\nthat has suggested itself to the writer that would seem to account for\r\nthese phenomena.\r\n\r\nLooked at from one standpoint, it is easy to account for tidal action.\r\nBut when we attempt to make up a table giving the hour and minute as\r\nwell as the height of the tide at that particular time we find that we\r\nhave a very complicated mathematical problem. However, tables are made\r\nout so that we know at just what time in the day a tide will occur every\r\nday in the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A SPONGE?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the great subject of water and ice--two of the most\r\ntremendous factors in world-building--let us consider a small matter, so\r\nfar as its permanent effects are concerned, yet one which enters largely\r\ninto the comfort and health of mankind, and which, though an animal, may\r\nbe discussed where it belongs--under \"Water.\"\r\n\r\nThere are few things more familiar about the ordinary household than a\r\npiece of sponge, and yet, perhaps, there are but few things about which\r\nthere is so little known. The sponge had been in use many, many years\r\nbefore it was given a place in either the animal or vegetable kingdom.\r\nThe casual observer, because he saw it attached to a rock, jumped to the\r\nconclusion that it was of vegetable origin. But after being kicked back\r\nand forth, so to speak, from one kingdom to the other, even by what are\r\ncalled well-educated people, it has finally been received into the\r\nfamily of animals; a dignity in which the sponge itself seems to take\r\nbut little interest.\r\n\r\nThe sponge is found in the bottom of the sea; at no very great depth,\r\nhowever. It is usually attached to a rock or some other substance and it\r\nis due to this fact chiefly that it has been classed as a vegetable. At\r\nleast one scientist has attempted to give it a place between the two\r\nkingdoms, but this only adds confusion without giving any satisfactory\r\nexplanation of its origin. It seems to belong to a very low order of\r\nanimal life. It breathes water instead of air, but probably, like many\r\nother water animals, it absorbs the oxygen from the air which is more or\r\nless contained in the water. There is a process of oxidation going on\r\nwithin the sponge in a manner somewhat as we find it in ordinary animal\r\nlife, and like the animal it expels carbon dioxide. All this, however,\r\nis carried on apparently without any lungs or any digestive organs, or\r\nin fact any of the organs that are common to the animals of the higher\r\norder. The sponge, however, as we see it in our bathrooms, is only the\r\nframework, bony structure, or skeleton of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe sponge is exceedingly porous and readily absorbs water or any fluid\r\nby the well-known process of capillary attraction. The sponge fiber is\r\nvery tough and is not like anything known to exist in the vegetable\r\nkingdom. The substance analyzes almost the same as ordinary silk, which\r\nall know is an animal product. If we burn a piece of sponge it exhibits\r\nvery much the same phenomena as the burning of hair or wool, and the\r\nsmell is very much the same.\r\n\r\nThe structure of a piece of sponge when examined under a microscope is a\r\nwonderfully complicated fabric. Under the microscope it shows a network\r\nof interlacing filaments running in every direction in a system of\r\ncurved lines intersecting and interlacing with each other in a manner to\r\nleave capillary openings.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful structure, and one that a mechanical engineer could\r\nget many valuable lessons from. It will stand a strain in one direction\r\nas well as another. There are no special laminations or lines of\r\ncleavage; it is very resilient or elastic, and readily yields to\r\npressure, but as readily comes back to its normal position when the\r\npressure is relieved. If we examine the body of a sponge we shall notice\r\nthat there are occasional large openings into it, but everywhere\r\nsurrounded by smaller ones. If we should capture a live sponge and place\r\nit in an aquarium with sea water, where we could study it, we should\r\nfind a circulation constantly going on, and that water was constantly\r\nsucked in at the smaller openings all over the outside of the sponge and\r\nas continuously ejected from the large openings. This process\r\nconstitutes what corresponds in the higher order of animals to both\r\nrespiration and blood circulation, combined. The sponge feeds upon\r\nsubstances that are gathered up from the sea water, and breathes the air\r\ncontained in the same, so that it breathes, eats, and drinks through the\r\nsame set of organs.\r\n\r\nWhen we first capture a live sponge from the sea it has a slimy, dirty\r\nappearance, and is very heavy. The sponge is found to be filled with a\r\nglutinous substance that is the fleshy part of the animal. It is very\r\nsoft and jelly-like, and after the sponge is dead it is readily squeezed\r\nout, by a process which is called \"taking the milk out,\" which leaves\r\nsimply the skeleton, the only useful part as an article of commerce.\r\nThis fleshy substance, in life, has somewhat the appearance and\r\ncomposition of the white of an egg.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical process by which the sponge takes its nourishment is\r\nexceedingly interesting. There are small globe-shaped cells with\r\nopenings through them that are lined with little hairlike projections\r\nthat move in such a manner as to suck the water in at one side of the\r\ncell and push it out at the other. These little fibers are technically\r\ncalled \"cilia.\" We might describe them as little suction pumps that are\r\nlocated at many points in the sponge, all acting conjointly to produce a\r\ncirculation through the finer openings or capillary vessels and finally\r\ndischarging into the larger chambers which carry off the residue. If we\r\nshould analyze the water as it is sucked into the sponge and that which\r\nissues from it through the larger openings, we should find a difference\r\nbetween the two. The expelled water would contain more or less carbon\r\ndioxide.\r\n\r\nThere are many different varieties of sponge, and, while they all\r\npossess certain characteristics in common, they are still very different\r\nin many respects. Some of them are large and coarse, while others are\r\nexceedingly soft and velvety. What is called a single sponge is a colony\r\nof animals rather than a single animal; at least they are so regarded by\r\nzooelogists. This can hardly be true if we regard the sponge itself as a\r\npart of the animal. If the sponge is simply regarded as the house in\r\nwhich the animal lives then it becomes a great tenement with numerous\r\noccupants. But it is a tenement upon which the life of the sponge\r\ndepends, and is a part of it.\r\n\r\nThe sponge could not breathe without the fibrous structure in the cells\r\ncontaining the machinery for producing the circulation. It will be seen\r\nthat the sponge, while it is an animal, is of the very simplest variety,\r\nso far as its organs are concerned. True, its framework is very\r\ncomplicated, but the organs for sustaining the life of the animal are\r\nthe simplest possible. The little self-acting pumps pull the water into\r\nthe sponge through the smaller openings, where it appropriates the food\r\nsubstance from the water and where a chemical action takes place which\r\nbuilds up the fleshy substance of the animal, and then expels the\r\nresidue which is not needed to support its life.\r\n\r\nSimple as it is, however, as a mechanical structure, the life and growth\r\nof the sponge is as mysterious as that of the most highly organized\r\nanimal or even the soul of man. We can study out the structure of a\r\nplant or animal; we can analyze it and tell what are the elements of\r\nwhich it is composed; we can describe the mechanical operations that are\r\ncarried on and the chemical combinations that take place, but no man has\r\never yet solved the mystery of life, even in the lowest form--whether\r\nanimal or vegetable.\r\n\r\nThe sponge, whether considered as a single or compound animal, has the\r\npower to reproduce itself, and here the mystery of life is as much\r\nhidden as it is in God's highest creation. It has been stated that every\r\nsponge contains a large number of separate cells which carry on the\r\noperation of circulation and respiration, and may be likened to the\r\nheart and lungs of an animal of a higher creation. Zooelogists claim that\r\neach one of these cells represents a separate animal, living in a common\r\nstructure. However this may be, it is an interesting fact that the\r\nsponge has the power of secreting ova that grow in large numbers in\r\nlittle sacks until they have reached a certain stage of progress, when\r\nthey are expelled from the mother sponge and turned adrift in the great\r\nocean to struggle for their own existence. These eggs do not differ much\r\nin their structure and composition from an ordinary hen's egg, except\r\nthat there is no shell, only a skin provided with little fibers called\r\ncilia, that project from it, and by the movement of these the embryo\r\nsponge is able to propel itself through the water. It thus lives until\r\nit has reached a certain stage of development, when it seeks out a\r\npebble or rock, to which it attaches itself at one end--preparation for\r\nwhich has been made by its peculiar structure during its life when it\r\nwas free to float around through the water. It is now a prisoner and\r\nchained to the rock it has selected for the foundation of its home.\r\nHaving no longer any use for the little cilia, which enabled it to swim\r\nthrough the water, it now loses them. Here is a beautiful illustration\r\nof how nature provides for the necessities of the smallest things, and\r\nhow when the necessity that demanded a certain condition passes by the\r\ncondition passes with it. The embryo begins to show a fibrous\r\ndevelopment, which is the beginning of the framework of a new sponge.\r\nEvolution goes on, every step of which is as mysterious as a miracle,\r\nuntil the growing thing is a full-grown sponge, equipped with the means\r\nfor respiration, circulation, feeding, digestion, and reproduction.\r\n\r\nSponges grow in the bottom of the sea at different depths. They are\r\nobtained by divers who make a business of gathering them. The best\r\nsponges are called the Turkish sponge, which are very soft and velvety,\r\nand may be bleached until they are nearly white by subjecting them to\r\nthe action of certain acids. The divers become very expert, but they do\r\nnot have the modern equipments of a diving suit. The Syrian divers in\r\nthe Mediterranean go down naked with a rope attached to their waists and\r\na stone attached to the rope to cause them to sink, together with a bag\r\nfor carrying the sponges. They have trained themselves until they can\r\nremain under water from a minute to a minute and a half, and in that\r\ntime can gather from one to three dozen sponges. The ordinary depth to\r\nwhich they descend is from eight to twelve fathoms. But a very expert\r\ndiver will go down as far as forty fathoms. The better class of sponges\r\nare said to grow in the deeper waters. The coarse inferior sponges are\r\ncalled the Bahama sponge. This sponge is of a peculiar shape, growing\r\nmore like a brush, with long bristly fiber.\r\n\r\nThe trade in sponges is quite large. The consumption in Great Britain\r\nalone amounts to about $1,000,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe sponge as an animal possesses many advantages over his more\r\naristocratic neighbor, man. He breathes but he has no lungs, and\r\ntherefore cannot have pneumonia. He digests his food, but he has no\r\nstomach, and therefore never has dyspepsia, gastritis, or any of the\r\nmany ailments that belong to that much abused organ. He has no\r\nintestines, and therefore cannot have appendicitis or Asiatic cholera or\r\nany of the long train of diseases incident to those complicated organs.\r\nHe has no nervous system--oh, happy sponge!--therefore he cannot have\r\nnervous prostration, hysteria, or epilepsy. He has no use for doctors,\r\nand therefore has no unpleasant discussions with his neighbors about the\r\nrelative merits of the different schools of medicine. If he has any\r\npredilections in the way of \"pathies\" we should say that he is a\r\nhydropath. While he is a great drinker, he is not at all convivial--he\r\ndrinks only water, and takes that in solitary silence. He sows all his\r\nwild oats when he is very young, while he has the freedom to roam at\r\nwill. He soon tires of this, however, for he selects the rock that is to\r\nbe the foundation of his future home and there settles down for life,\r\n\"wrapt in the solitude of his own originality.\" He is not troubled with\r\nwars or rumors of wars. His eyes are never startled or his nerves shaken\r\nby the scare headlines of yellow journalism. The one sensation of his\r\nlife, if sensation he ever has, is when a great ugly creature of some\r\nOriental clime comes down to his home and tears him away from his native\r\nrock, carries him to the surface, and there literally \"squeezes the life\r\nout of him.\" He finally dies of the \"grip,\" and here he sinks to the\r\nlevel of his more aristocratic neighbor.\r\n\r\nBut there is another side to our philosophy. If the sponge is exempt\r\nfrom all these ills that we have enumerated it is because he is\r\nincapable of suffering and is therefore incapable of enjoyment. Those\r\nbeings that have the ability to suffer most have also the ability to\r\nenjoy most. The higher the type of civilization the greater\r\npossibilities it offers for real enjoyment--also for real misery. This\r\nbeing true, it should be the aim of highly civilized people to eliminate\r\nas far as possible those things that make for misery, and cultivate\r\nthose things that make for happiness in the highest and best sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nWATER AND ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now have entered upon a subject that is of intense interest, studied\r\nfrom the standpoint of facts as they exist to-day and of history as we\r\nread it in the rocks and bowlders that we find distributed over the face\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nThe whole northern part of the United States extending to a point south\r\nof Cincinnati was at one time covered with a great ice-sheet, traces of\r\nwhich are plainly visible to anyone who has made anything of a study of\r\nthis subject. The glaciers now to be seen in British Columbia and\r\nAlaska, great as they seem to one viewing them to-day, are by comparison\r\nwith what once existed simply microscopic specks of ice. Glaciers, like\r\nrivers, flow by gravity, following the lowest bed and lines of least\r\nresistance; the difference being that in the one case the flow is rapid,\r\nwhile in the other it is scarcely visible, except by measurement from\r\nday to day. Before entering upon a description of the law that governs\r\nthe flow of glaciers, let us stop and give a little study to the\r\nphenomena of water as exhibited when it is at the freezing point. Water\r\nis such a large factor in the make-up of our globe and the air that\r\nsurrounds it that it becomes a very interesting and important study to\r\nanyone who wishes to understand the phenomena of nature that are closely\r\nrelated to it.\r\n\r\nAs all know, pure water is a compound of two gases, oxygen and hydrogen,\r\ncombined in the proportion of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen.\r\n\r\nLet us now study this fluid in its relation to heat. The reader is\r\nreferred to the chapters on heat in Vol. II., where it is stated that\r\nheat is a mode of motion. It is also stated that heat is a form of\r\nenergy, and that energy is indestructible, that an unvarying amount of\r\nit exists in some form or another throughout the universe. It is not\r\nalways manifested as heat or electricity, although both of these are\r\nalways in evidence as active agents of force. Much of the energy is\r\nsimply stored--all the time possessing the ability to do work or to be\r\nconverted into any of its known forms, such as heat, light, electricity,\r\nor mechanical motion. A weight that is wound up has required a certain\r\namount of energy to elevate it to the position that it occupies. While\r\nin its elevated position it possesses energy, although not active.\r\nEnergy in this form is called potential (possible) energy, and has the\r\npower to do work if released. Active energy is called kinetic (moving)\r\nenergy, and the sum of these two energies is a constant quantity.\r\n\r\nWe will now study energy as it is related to water in the form of heat.\r\nThere is a kind of heat called \"latent heat,\" which is not heat at all,\r\nbut stored energy, waiting to be turned into heat, or light, or some\r\nother active form. Properly speaking, heat is a movement of the atoms of\r\nmatter, the intensity of which is measurable in degrees, and called its\r\ntemperature. To use the term latent heat as meaning concealed heat,\r\nwhich must reappear as heat, is a misnomer and is very misleading. If it\r\nis proper to call a wound-up spring or weight latent heat then its\r\npresent use is a correct one. What was formerly termed latent heat is\r\nsimply a form of potential energy. When sensible heat that is\r\nmeasurable, as temperature, disappears in the performance of some sort\r\nof work, especially in connection with certain phenomena relating to\r\nwater, we call it--or rather miscall it--latent heat: but the phrase\r\nwould better be \"stored energy.\"\r\n\r\nThe action of water under heat is very peculiar, and in order to get a\r\ncorrect understanding of the phenomena exhibited in glacial action we\r\nalso need to understand the phenomena of water at the freezing point. As\r\nis well known, fresh water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and at the\r\nmoment of freezing there is a sudden expansion to such an extent that a\r\ncubic foot of ice will occupy a much larger space than it will in the\r\nform of water; and because it occupies so much larger space it is\r\nlighter than the same bulk of water would be, and therefore it floats in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAt the point of freezing, the thermometer if placed on the ice will\r\nregister 32 degrees. If the ice is allowed to melt, the water at the\r\nmoment of liquefaction would be found to register the same degree of\r\ntemperature as the ice when first frozen. And yet there has been a vast\r\nexpenditure of energy between the points of liquefaction and\r\ncongelation, notwithstanding the temperature of ice may be lowered,\r\nafter it is formed, many degrees, which is measurable by the\r\nthermometer. Suppose we take a piece of ice which is 10 degrees below\r\nthe freezing point and insert in it a thermometer. If now we apply heat\r\nto this ice the thermometer will gradually rise until it reaches the\r\nmelting point at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, where it will stand until all\r\nthe ice is melted. The application of heat is going on steadily, but\r\nthere are no indications of movement in the mercury until the last trace\r\nof ice with which it is in contact has been liquefied. After the ice is\r\nall melted, if the application of heat to the body of liquefied ice be\r\ncontinued, the column of mercury will resume its movement upward until\r\nit reaches the boiling point, where it is again arrested. And no matter\r\nhow much heat is applied to the boiling water, if in an open vessel, the\r\nthermometer remains the same until all the water is evaporated. Here are\r\ntwo curious facts, and they are facts that, if we can master them, will\r\nserve as a key to the understanding of much that is mysterious in\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIt will be our endeavor to give the reader a mental picture of what is\r\ntaking place during the time the ice is melting and the thermometer is\r\nstationary. Do not suppose that you can understand this, even so far as\r\nit is understandable, by a casual reading without thought. No man was\r\never yet able to present a picture to the mind of another, however\r\nclearly and simply it may be done, unless that other mind is receptive.\r\nWhen a photographer trains his camera upon an object, however intense\r\nthe light may be and however clean-cut the picture that is thrown upon\r\nthe plate in the camera, unless that plate is properly sensitized so\r\nthat the picture may be impressed upon it, all of the other conditions\r\nare in vain. The reader is always a part of the book he is reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nSTORED ENERGY IN WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last chapter we traced the upward movement in the mercury of the\r\nthermometer from 10 degrees below the freezing point up to the boiling\r\npoint of water. We found that the thermometer was arrested at 32 degrees\r\nand remained stationary at that point until all the ice was melted,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that heat was being constantly applied. After\r\nthe ice is all melted the mercury moves upward until it reaches the\r\nboiling point of water, where the movement is again arrested, and\r\nalthough the heat is being continuously applied, it remains stationary\r\nuntil all the water is evaporated. If we push the process still further,\r\nwith a sufficient application of energy we can separate the vapor\r\nmolecules into their original elements, oxygen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nLet us go back now to the freezing point of water and see what is\r\nbecoming of the heat that is consumed in melting the cake of ice, and\r\nstill does not produce any effect upon the mercury in the thermometer.\r\nSensible heat, as before stated, is a movement of the atoms of matter,\r\nand temperature, as it affects the thermometer, is a measure of the\r\nintensity of motion exhibited by these atoms.\r\n\r\nIn the experiment of the block of ice that in the beginning is 10\r\ndegrees below the freezing point, as shown by the thermometer, the\r\nmolecules have a definite intensity of motion. The intensity of this\r\nmotion increases when heat is applied until it reaches 32 degrees, when\r\nit remains stationary until all of the ice is melted. At this point\r\nthere is a rearrangement of the molecules of water as it assumes the\r\nliquid state. To perform this rearrangement requires a certain amount of\r\nwork done, which is analogous to the winding up of a weight to a certain\r\ndistance. There has been energy used in winding up the weight, but that\r\nenergy now is not destroyed, nor still in the form of heat, but is in\r\nthe potential state--ready to do some other kind of work. So, the heat\r\nthat has been applied to the melting ice has been utilized during the\r\nprocess of its liquefaction in rearranging the water molecules and\r\nputting them in a state of strain, so to speak, like the weight that is\r\nwound up to a certain height. There is a certain amount of potential\r\nenergy that is stored in the molecules of water that will be given up\r\nand become active energy in the form of heat, if the water is again\r\nfrozen. To melt a cubic foot of ice requires as much heat as it would\r\nto raise a cubic foot of water 144 degrees Fahrenheit. But, as we have\r\nseen, while all of this energy is absorbed as heat, it is not lost as\r\nenergy. It ceases to be kinetic or active and becomes potential energy.\r\nThis (let us repeat) has been called latent heat. The term grew out of\r\nthe old idea that heat was a fluid and that when it became latent it hid\r\nitself away somewhere in the interatomic spaces of matter and ceased to\r\nbe longer sensible heat. It came into existence in the same manner and\r\noccupies the same place in the science of heat that the word \"current\"\r\ndoes in the science of electricity: both of them are misnomers.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice is all melted potential energy is no longer stored, but is\r\nmanifested in the sensible heating of water, the degree of which is\r\nmeasurable by the thermometer, until it reaches the boiling point, where\r\nit is again arrested. All of the surplus heat above that temperature is\r\nconsumed in rending the liquid water into moisture globules that float\r\naway into the air, each one of them charged with a store of potential\r\nenergy. Let us follow this vapor spherule as it floats into the upper\r\nregions of the atmosphere. Myriads of its fellows travel with it until\r\nit reaches a point where condensation takes place, when it collapses and\r\nunites with other vapor particles to form water again. In doing this the\r\nheat that was expended upon it to disengage it (whether the heat was\r\nartificial or that of the sun's rays) now reappears either as sensible\r\nheat or as electricity, or both. And this is what is meant in\r\nmeteorology by latent heat becoming sensible heat at the time of\r\ncondensation; in fact, it is stored or \"potential\" energy becoming\r\nactive or kinetic, and assumes the form of heat or electricity, as\r\nbefore stated. We have thus reviewed the matter of the foregoing chapter\r\nin order to follow the course of the stored energy from the melting of\r\nthe ice to the vapor, and back again to water: to doubly impress the\r\nfact that the energy used was not consumed, but still exists and is\r\nready for further work.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of a hailstorm, it has been stated, one of the\r\nfactors that is active to produce this phenomenon is the intense\r\nascensional force that is given to the moisture-laden air, caused by\r\nintense heat at the surface of the earth. This condition forces the\r\nmoisture vapor to higher regions of the atmosphere than is the case with\r\nthe ordinary thunderstorm. Another factor that is undoubtedly active in\r\nproducing hail under these circumstances is that when condensation takes\r\nplace in the higher regions, and is therefore more energetic on account\r\nof the intenser cold, the potential energy that is set free by the\r\nmoisture spherules takes, in a larger degree, the form of electricity\r\nrather than heat, as is the case under more ordinary circumstances.\r\nWhile in the end this electrical energy becomes active heat, it does not\r\nfor the time being, and thus favors the ready congelation of the\r\ncondensed moisture into hailstones. Hailstorms are always attended by\r\nincessant thunder and lightning, and this fact favors the theory\r\nadvanced above.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily seen from a study of the foregoing what a wonderful\r\nfactor evaporation (which is a product of the sun's rays) is, in the\r\nplay of celestial dynamics. It ascends from the surface of the earth or\r\nocean laden with a stored energy, the power of which no man can compute,\r\nand beside which gravitation is a mere point. In the upper regions of\r\natmosphere this potential force under certain conditions is released and\r\nbecomes an active factor, not only in the formation of cloud and the\r\nprecipitation of rain, hail, and snow, but it disturbs the equilibrium\r\nof the air and sets that in motion.\r\n\r\nCertain physicists deny that evaporation has anything to do with\r\natmospheric electricity. They tell us that it is caused by the arrest of\r\nthe energy of the sunbeam by the clouds and vapor in the upper\r\natmosphere. We admit that a part of the energy is so arrested, and is\r\nstored, for the time, in moisture globules by a process of cloud\r\nevaporation to transparent vapor again. Yet this does not hinder the\r\nsame process from going on at the surface of the earth wherever there is\r\nwater or moisture. But they tell us that the electroscope does not show\r\nany signs of electrification in the evaporated moisture. Of course it\r\ndoes not. The electroscope is not made to detect the presence of energy\r\nexcept when set free as electricity.\r\n\r\nA wound-up spring does not seem to be electrified, but if it is released\r\nthe energy stored in it will be transformed into electricity if the\r\nconditions are right. Just so, the energy required to put the moisture\r\nspherule into a state of strain is latent until some power releases it,\r\nwhen it reappears as active energy of some form.\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the relation of heat to water from a point 10\r\ndegrees below freezing up to where it was forced into its original\r\ngases, oxygen and hydrogen. These gases have stored in them a wonderful\r\namount of potential energy. When one pound of hydrogen and eight pounds\r\nof oxygen unite to form water the mechanical value of the energy given\r\nup at that time in the form of heat is represented by 47,000,000 pounds\r\nraised to one foot in height. And this is the measure of the energy that\r\nwas put into nine pounds of water to force it from a state of vapor into\r\nits constituent gases. After the combination of the gases into a state\r\nof vapor the temperature sinks to that of boiling water. The amount of\r\nenergy given up in condensing the nine pounds of vapor into nine pounds\r\nof water is equal to 6,720,000 foot-pounds. If this nine pounds of water\r\nis now cooled from the boiling point to 32 degrees Fahrenheit we come to\r\nthe final fall, where the potential energy that is stored in the\r\noperation of melting ice is given up suddenly at the moment of freezing,\r\nwhich in nine pounds of water is 993,546 foot pounds.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall, in speaking of the amount of energy that is given up\r\nbetween the points where the constituent gases unite to form nine pounds\r\nof water and the point where it congeals as ice, says: \"Our nine pounds\r\nof water, at its origin and during its progress, falls down three\r\nprecipices--the first fall is equivalent in energy to the descent of a\r\nton weight down a precipice 22,320 feet high-over four miles; the second\r\nfall is equal to that of a ton down a precipice 2900 feet high, and the\r\nthird is equal to a fall of a ton down a precipice 433 feet high. I have\r\nseen the wild stone avalanches of the Alps, which smoke and thunder down\r\nthe declivities with a vehemence almost sufficient to stun the observer.\r\nI have also seen snowflakes descending so softly as not to hurt the\r\nfragile spangles of which they are composed. Yet to produce from aqueous\r\nvapor a quantity which a child could carry of that tender material\r\ndemands an exertion of energy competent to gather up the shattered\r\nblocks of the largest stone avalanche I have ever seen and pitch them to\r\ntwice the height from which they fell.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate the foregoing facts as related to so small an amount\r\nof water as nine pounds, and multiply this result by the amount of snow-\r\nand rainfall each year and the amount of ice that is congealed and again\r\nliquefied by the power of the sun's rays, we are appalled, and shrink\r\nfrom the task of attempting to reduce the amount of energy expended in a\r\nsingle year to measurable units.\r\n\r\nHaving considered water in its relation to heat in the preceding\r\nchapters, we will now take up the subject of water in its relation to\r\nice and snowfall and the phenomena exhibited in ice rivers, commonly\r\ncalled glaciers.\r\n\r\nWhen water is under pressure the freezing point is reduced several\r\ndegrees below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. This fact has been determined by\r\nconfining water in a close vessel and putting it under pressure and\r\nsubjecting it to a freezing mixture, and by this means determining the\r\nfreezing point under such conditions. By putting a bullet or something\r\nof that nature into the water that is subjected to pressure one can tell\r\nby shaking it when the freezing point is reached. If water is put under\r\npressure and cooled to a point below 32 degrees, and yet still remains\r\nin the liquid state, it may be suddenly congealed by taking off the\r\npressure; this shows that the pressure helps to hold the molecules in\r\nthe position necessary for the liquid state, and prevents the\r\nrearrangement of them that takes place at the moment of freezing. When\r\nthe water molecules are arranged for the liquid condition they may be\r\ncompared to a spring that is wound up and held in position by the heat\r\nenergy that is stored in the water. And when this energy is given up to\r\na certain degree the power that holds the spring wound up is suddenly\r\nreleased, when it unwinds and occupies a larger space. There is a force\r\nthat we may call polar force, which is constantly tending to push the\r\nmolecules of water into an arrangement such as we see when\r\ncrystallization takes place--as it always does in the act of freezing.\r\nThese polar forces cannot act so long as the energy in the form of heat\r\nis sufficient to hold the water in the fluid state. But the moment this\r\nenergy, which tends to hold it in the fluid state, falls below that\r\nwhich tends to rearrange it into the crystalline form, it is overcome by\r\nthe superior power of the latter force, and we have the phenomenon of\r\nsolidified water.\r\n\r\nA very interesting experiment may be performed with a block of ice by\r\nanyone when the ice is near the melting point. If a wire is put around\r\nthe ice and a sufficient weight is suspended to it, the pressure of the\r\nwire on the ice will gradually liquefy that portion immediately under\r\nthe wire, which allows it to sink into the ice slowly, and as this\r\nprocess goes on the ice freezes together again behind the wire, so that\r\nin time the wire will pass entirely through the block and leave it still\r\na solid block, as it was before the experiment began.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting fact which it will be well to remember when we\r\ncome to explain glacial action, or rather the law that governs glacial\r\naction. If we take two pieces of melting ice and bring them together\r\nthey immediately congeal at the point of contact. This phenomenon is\r\ncalled \"regelation.\" Ice has some of the properties of a viscous\r\nsubstance. It will yield slowly to pressure, especially when near the\r\nmelting point, but if put under a tensional strain it will break, as any\r\nbrittle substance will, so that it has the properties of both viscosity\r\nand brittleness. Ordinarily we are in the habit of treating water as a\r\nfluid and ice as a solid, but from what has gone before the reader must\r\nunderstand that in a certain sense ice should be treated as having\r\nsemi-fluidic properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nWHY DOES ICE FLOAT?\r\n\r\n\r\nNature is full of surprises. By a long series of experimental\r\ninvestigations you think you have established a law that is as\r\nunalterable as those of the Medes and Persians. But once in a while you\r\nstumble upon phenomena that seem to contradict all that has gone before.\r\n\r\nThese, however, may be only the exceptions that prove the rule. It is\r\nrecognized as a fundamental law that heat expands and cold contracts;\r\nthat the atom when in a state of intense motion (which is the condition\r\nproducing the effect that we call \"heat\") requires more room than when\r\nits motions are of a less amplitude. In other words, an increase in the\r\namplitude of atomic motion is heating, while a decrease is cooling. It\r\nfollows from the above statement that the colder a body becomes the\r\nsmaller will be its dimensions. There are two or three, and perhaps\r\nmore, exceptions to this rule, and the most notable one is that of\r\nwater. Water follows the same law that all other substances do under the\r\naction of heat and cold, within certain limits only. If we take water,\r\nsay, at 50 degrees Fahrenheit and subject it to cold it will gradually\r\ncontract in bulk until it reaches 39 degrees Fahrenheit. At this point,\r\nvery curiously, contraction ceases, and here we find the maximum density\r\nof water. If the temperature is still lowered we find the bulk is\r\ngradually increasing instead of diminishing (as is the rule with other\r\nfluids), and when it reaches the freezing point there is a sudden and\r\nmarked expansion, so much so that a cubic foot of ice, which is\r\nsolidified water, will not weigh as much as a cubic foot of water before\r\nit freezes--hence it floats.\r\n\r\nLet us try an experiment. Take a small glass flask, terminating in a\r\nlong neck, say of four to six inches, and of small diameter. Suppose the\r\nwater in the glass to be at 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Fill the flask with\r\nwater until it stands halfway up the neck at 50 degrees temperature. Now\r\nimmerse the flask gradually in hot water, and observe the effect. For a\r\nmoment the water will lower in the neck of the tube, but this is due to\r\nthe fact that the glass expands before the heat is communicated to the\r\nwater and enlarges its capacity. But immediately the water will begin to\r\nrise as the heat is communicated to it, and will continue to expand up\r\nto the boiling point. Now take the flask out of the hot water and\r\ngradually introduce it into a freezing mixture made of broken ice and\r\nsalt. Immediately the water will begin to fall in the tube, showing that\r\nit is contracting under the cold, and it will continue to contract until\r\nit reaches a temperature of 39 degrees Fahrenheit, when it will come to\r\na standstill and then proceed to expand as the temperature of the water\r\nlowers. When it reaches the freezing point the fluid can no longer rise\r\nin the neck of the flask, which is broken by the sudden expansion that\r\ntakes place at this point.\r\n\r\nTo show what an irresistible power resides in the atoms of which the\r\nbody is made, let us take an iron flask with walls one-half inch or more\r\nin thickness; fill it with water and seal it up by screwing on the neck\r\nan iron cap; now plunge it into the freezing mixture, and the first\r\neffect will be to contract the water unless it is already below 39\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, but when it reaches that point expansion sets in,\r\nwhich continues to the freezing point, when a greatly increased\r\nexpansion takes place suddenly. The walls of the iron flask, although a\r\nhalf-inch in thickness, are no longer able to resist the combined\r\nefforts of the billions upon billions of the atoms of which the water is\r\nmade up, in their individual clamor for more room, hence the flask is\r\nshivered into pieces.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two other substances which are exceptions to the\r\ngeneral rule, but we will mention only one, which is the metal bismuth.\r\nIf we should melt a sufficient amount to fill an iron flask, such as we\r\nhave described, and subject it to the same freezing process, the flask\r\nwill be broken the same as in the experiment made with the water.\r\n\r\nA query arises, Why this phenomenon? Why does water follow a different\r\nlaw in cooling from that of nearly all other substances?\r\n\r\nThis is a case where it is much easier to ask a question than to answer\r\nit. When water solidifies at the moment of freezing, crystallization\r\nsets in. But what is crystallization? Crystallization is a peculiar\r\narrangement of the molecules of matter, which takes place in some\r\nsubstances when they pass from the liquid to the solid form. The\r\nmolecules assume definite forms and shapes, according to the nature of\r\nthe substance. When water assumes the solid form under the action of\r\ncold the molecules arrange themselves according to certain definite and\r\nfixed laws, the result of which is to increase the bulk to a\r\nconsiderable extent over that which the same number of molecules would\r\noccupy at a temperature of 39 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence, as has been\r\nheretofore stated, a given block of solidified water is lighter than the\r\nsame bulk would be in the fluid state, and this is the reason why ice\r\nfloats.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen in case nature did not make this exception to the laws\r\nof expansion and contraction by heat and cold, in the case of water?\r\nFirst, our lakes would freeze from the bottom upward; as soon as the\r\nsurface became frozen, or even colder than the water underneath, it\r\nwould drop to the bottom, the warmer water below coming up by a\r\nwell-known law--that the warmer fluid rises and the colder falls. This\r\ncirculation would continue until ice began to form, which would\r\nimmediately drop to the bottom, and this process would go on until the\r\nwhole mass were frozen solid. In the same way our rivers in the northern\r\nclimates would freeze from the bottom, and in time our valleys would\r\nfill up with ice to a thickness that the summer's sun would never melt,\r\nand gradually all north of a certain zone would become a great glacier,\r\nrendering not only the lakes and rivers but also the surface of the\r\nearth unfitted for animal life.\r\n\r\nThose who believe that the laws of nature are the creations of a\r\nbeneficent and all-wise Intelligence will see in this exception to the\r\ngeneral law in the case of freezing water a striking evidence of design.\r\nBut those who have no such belief will say it is a most fortunate though\r\nfortuitous circumstance (a saying they will have to make, regarding\r\nthousands of other things in nature), and go on floundering in the\r\ninterminable sea of \"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nThe atom when it is acting under the direction of a fixed law is a giant\r\nin strength. And when its individual strength is multiplied by billions\r\nupon billions the combined energy exerted produces a power that is\r\nirresistible. Not only has nature endowed these atoms with this\r\nwonderful power, but she has also willed that they arrange themselves in\r\nlines of beauty. In confirmation of this we need only to study the work\r\nof the frost upon our window panes. As we lie in our beds on a cold\r\nnight and exhale moisture from our lungs it settles upon the window\r\npanes of our bedrooms, where Nature--that wonderful artist--forms it\r\ninto beautiful pictures that gladden our eyes when we awake:\r\n\r\n    Most beautiful things; there are flowers and trees,\r\n    And bevies of birds, and swarms of bees,\r\n    And cities, and temples, and towers, and these\r\n    All pictured in silver sheen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nGLACIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlaciers are rivers of ice, and, like other rivers, some of them are\r\nsmall and some very large. They flow down the gorges from high\r\nmountains, whose peaks are always covered with a blanket of eternal\r\nsnow. Summer and winter the snow is precipitated upon these mountains,\r\nand from time to time the heat of the sun's rays softens the snow, when\r\nby its great weight it packs more closely together until it is, in many\r\ncases, formed into solid ice-cakes. If we take a quantity of snow or a\r\nquantity of granulated ice and put it under a sufficient pressure we can\r\nproduce clear solid ice, and it is by this process that ice is formed\r\nout of the snow and hail that falls continually upon the tops of these\r\nglacial mountains. We have seen that ice possesses certain viscous or\r\nsemi-fluidic properties and that it will yield to pressure, but if we\r\nput it under sufficient tensional strain it snaps like glass or any\r\nother brittle substance. As the snows upon these mountains pile up\r\nhigher and higher the pressure becomes greater and greater until it\r\nreaches a point where the mass begins to move gradually down the\r\nmountain side, following the gulches and defiles that furnish a path of\r\nleast resistance to its flow.\r\n\r\nAt the sides and bottom, where there is contact with the earth, the\r\nmovement is slower than it is at the surface and in the middle of the\r\nice stream. If there were no curves in the ravine or gulch through which\r\nit flows the point of greatest movement would be confined to the middle\r\nof its width. But in flowing through a winding gulch the most rapid flow\r\nfollow the lines of greatest pressure, and this line is deflected from\r\nside to side, so that the line of greatest flow is more winding than is\r\nthe bottom of the valley through which it flows. (The movement is called\r\na \"flow,\" but it is very sluggish, only a few inches in a day, as will\r\nappear later.)\r\n\r\nIf the bottom and sides of the valley were straight the surface of the\r\nice would be comparatively even; I say comparatively, for as compared\r\nwith a smooth surface it would be very rough; but there would be none of\r\nthe great crevasses or openings now to be found in the ice, which\r\nsometimes are very large and extend to a great depth. If in its downward\r\ncourse the bottom of the ravine suddenly becomes steeper, the top of the\r\nice is put under a tensional strain which causes it to break, thus\r\nforming the crevasses.\r\n\r\nIf at the bottom of the descent the valley curves upward or preserves\r\nthe straight line for a considerable distance, these crevasses will\r\nclose at the top and perhaps open at the bottom, and the blocks of ice\r\nwill freeze together to such an extent that the water caused by the\r\nmelting ice will flow on top until it comes to another crevasse, where\r\nit runs through to the bottom or underflow, which is always an attendant\r\nof a glacier.\r\n\r\nThe glacier continues its flow down the mountain side till in some cases\r\nit reaches quite to the valley below, and in others it stops short, as\r\nthe action of the sun is so great that it melts entirely away at this\r\npoint as fast as it moves down. In the winter time, however, the glacier\r\nmay flow far down into the valley and will accumulate greatly in bulk,\r\nowing to the fact that the ice forms from the precipitation of snow on\r\ntop faster than it melts away underneath. If it were not for the fact\r\nthat in summer the glaciers melt faster than they form, the whole valley\r\nwould in time become a great river of ice. It is the case in Switzerland\r\nthat some years the accumulation is greater from snowfall than\r\ndiminution from melting. If this condition should continue it would\r\nbecome a serious matter.\r\n\r\nIn the downward flow of a glacier--slow as it is--there is an exhibition\r\nof wonderful power; great bowlders are torn from their beds and either\r\nground to powder or carried down to the end of the glacier, to be\r\ndropped with the other debris that has been carried there by the same\r\nforce, forming an accumulation that geologists call the \"moraine.\" Of\r\nthese moraines we will speak more fully later on.\r\n\r\nIt was the privilege of the writer some years since to visit the great\r\nglaciers of Switzerland and to some extent study their action. Some\r\nrivers have their origin chiefly in melting glaciers. They start as ice\r\nrivers and end in rivers of water. The effects during the great ice age\r\nof some of these glacial rivers, which are now extinct, are very\r\nremarkable; we shall have occasion to refer to them when we come to\r\ntreat of the glacial period.\r\n\r\nThere is a glacial river flowing which is fed largely by the great Rhone\r\nglacier in Switzerland. The water from this river is almost as white as\r\nmilk, which is occasioned by the grinding action of the great ice blocks\r\non the rock as it flows down the sides of the mountain. These glacial\r\nrivers are much higher in summer, of course, than in winter, some of\r\nthem having not only an annual fluctuation, but a diurnal one. The\r\nformer is caused by the cold of winter, and the latter because it\r\nfreezes to some extent at night and checks the flow of water. The\r\ndifference between day and night in these high altitudes is very marked.\r\nWhile it is extremely hot in the sun, it is cool the moment we step into\r\nthe shade.\r\n\r\nI remember walking across one of the glaciers in the Alps, called the\r\nMer de Glace, one clear day in summer, when I suffered so much from the\r\nheat, although standing upon a sea of ice, that it was necessary to\r\ncarry an umbrella. In fact, during my stay there was a case of sunstroke\r\nthat occurred upon this same glacier. This intense heat during the day\r\nmelts the surface of the ice, which forms streams that run along on the\r\ntop of a glacier until they come to a crevasse or riffle in the ice\r\nriver, where they plunge down and become a part of the glacial stream\r\nthat is flowing underneath the ice.\r\n\r\nThe speed at which these ice streams flow varies greatly with the size\r\nof the glacier as to width and depth and the steepness of the grade, and\r\nmany other conditions. In its movement the glacier is constantly bending\r\nand freezing and being torn asunder by tensional strain, yielding and\r\nliquefying at other points by pressure, only to freeze again when that\r\npressure is removed. This, taken in connection with the friction of the\r\ngreat ice bowlders, produces a movement that is exceedingly complicated\r\nin its actions and interactions.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Tyndall's investigations, the most rapid movement\r\nobserved in the glaciers of Switzerland is thirty-seven inches per day\r\nat the point of greatest movement. From this point each way the motion\r\ngradually diminishes until it reaches the sides of the glacier, where\r\nthe motion is not more than two or three inches.\r\n\r\nThe great North American glaciers move at a much higher rate of speed.\r\nWe are indebted to Dr. G. Frederick Wright, author of \"The Ice Age in\r\nNorth America,\" who spent a month studying the Muir glacier in Alaska,\r\nfor many details concerning that great ice river. This glacier empties\r\ninto Muir Inlet, which is an offshoot of Glacier Bay. It is situated in\r\nlatitude 58 degrees 50 minutes and longitude 136 degrees 40 minutes west\r\nof Greenwich. The bay into which this glacier empties is about thirty\r\nmiles long and from eight to twelve miles wide. This bay, with its great\r\nglacier, has a setting of grand mountain peaks. I cannot do better than\r\nto quote the words of Dr. Wright when he describes the location of this\r\nglacier. Dr. Wright lived for a month in a tent on the edge of this bay,\r\na short distance below the face of the great glacier, where the icebergs\r\nfell off every few minutes into the deep water.\r\n\r\nHe says: \"To the south the calm surface of the bay opened outward into\r\nCross Sound twenty-five miles away. The islands dotting the smooth\r\nsurface of the waters below us seemed but specks, and the grand vista of\r\nsnowclad mountains guarding either side of Chatham Strait seemed\r\ngradually to come to a point on the southern horizon. Westward toward\r\nthe Pacific was the marvelous outline of the southern portion of the St.\r\nElias Alps. The lofty peaks of Crillon, 15,900 feet high, and Fair\r\nWeather, 15,500 feet high, about twenty-five miles away and about the\r\nsame distance apart, stood as sentinels over the lesser peaks.\"\r\n\r\nThe Muir glacier might be likened to a great inland sea of ice fed by\r\nmany tributaries or ice rivers. It narrows up at the point where it\r\nempties into Muir Inlet to 10,664 feet, or a little over two miles. An\r\nenormous pressure is exerted at this point, which causes the ice to flow\r\nin the central portion at the rate of about seventy feet per day. There\r\nis a continual booming, like the firing of a cannon, going on, caused by\r\nthe bursting of some great iceberg either before it takes its final leap\r\ninto the water or at the moment of its fall. At the point where these\r\ngreat icebergs drop off into the water they stand like a solid wall 300\r\nfeet above its surface. Dr. Wright says: \"From this point there is a\r\nconstant succession of falls of ice into the water, accompanied by loud\r\nreports. Scarcely ten minutes, either night or day, passed during the\r\nwhole month without our being startled with such reports; and frequently\r\nthey were like thunder claps or the booming of cannon at the\r\nbombardment of a besieged city, and this though our camp was two and\r\none-half miles below the ice front.... Repeatedly I have seen vast\r\ncolumns of ice extending up to the full height of the front topple over\r\nand fall into the water. How far these columns extended below the water\r\ncould not be told accurately, but I have seen bergs floating away which\r\nwere certainly 500 feet in length.\"\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the cubical contents of some of these icebergs are\r\nequal to 40,000,000 feet. This great glacier is fed by the constant\r\nprecipitation of snow upon the sides and peaks of the high mountains\r\nthat surround its vast amphitheater, which is floored with icebergs.\r\nWonderful as this seems to us to-day, it is scarcely a microscopic speck\r\nof what existed during the ice age all over the northern part of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThere are many other great glaciers in the mountains of the Pacific\r\ncoast. Some years ago I saw one of these immense glaciers in British\r\nColumbia, from a point called Glacier Station, in the Selkirk Mountains,\r\non the Canadian Pacific Railroad. It was during the month of August,\r\nwhen all of the region was pervaded by a dense smoke occasioned by\r\nburning forests. This glacier is a very showy one, owing to the\r\nsteepness of the side of the mountain and its great breadth. All the\r\nglaciers that exist to-day are gradually receding, and are destined\r\neventually to entirely disappear, unless there is a change in\r\nmeteorological conditions, which some scientists claim will be the case\r\nif we only wait long enough, when again all this northern country will\r\nbe covered with a great ice sheet. There is no doubt in regard to the\r\nfacts concerning a glacial period that must have existed in the ages\r\npast. To anyone who has made a study of the subject there is not wanting\r\nabundant evidence to prove that this northern country was at one time\r\nenveloped with a great ice sheet of enormous thickness. The conditions\r\nthat existed to bring about such a state of things have been the subject\r\nof much speculation by philosophers, but no one, as yet, has arrived at\r\nany very satisfactory conclusion. Many theories have been advanced, some\r\nof them not worth considering, while others have many things that give\r\nthem a show of plausibility. But all of them have what is said of the\r\nDarwinian theory, \"a missing link.\" It will be interesting, however, and\r\nalso instructive, to know what can be said in favor of a set of\r\nconditions that would produce such momentous results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES AND THEORIES OF AN ICE AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is abundant and unassailable evidence that at one time, ages ago,\r\na vast ice sheet covered the whole of the northern part of North\r\nAmerica, extending south in Illinois to a point between latitudes 37 and\r\n38. This is the most southerly point to which the ice sheet reached.\r\nFrom this point the line of extreme flow runs off in a northeasterly and\r\nnorthwesterly direction. The northeasterly line is through southeastern\r\nOhio and Pennsylvania, striking the Atlantic Ocean about at New York,\r\nthence through Long Island and up the coast of Massachusetts.\r\nNorthwesterly it follows the Mississippi River to its junction with the\r\nMissouri, which it crosses at a point some miles west of this junction,\r\nfollowing the general course of this river a little south of it through\r\nthe States of Missouri, Nebraska, Dakota, and Montana. The lines,\r\nespecially the northeasterly one, are very irregular, shooting out into\r\ncurves and then receding. This line of extreme ice flow is marked by\r\nglacial drift so prominently that no one who has studied glacial action\r\ncan doubt for a moment what was the cause of these deposits. The line\r\nis called the \"terminal moraine.\" By examining a map of North America\r\nand tracing the line of the moraine as we have described it, it will be\r\nseen that about two-thirds of North America was at one time covered with\r\nice to a greater or less depth. How deep, is simply a matter of\r\nconjecture, but in the central portions of the great glacier, where was\r\nthe bulk of snowfall, it must have reached a depth of several miles to\r\naccount for the enormous pressure that would be required to carry the\r\nice so far southward.\r\n\r\nBut let us go back and define what is meant by a moraine. A moraine is a\r\nname given to the deposits that are of stone, gravel, and earth that\r\nhave been carried along by the movement of the glaciers and deposited at\r\ntheir margins, sometimes piled up to great depths. The composition of\r\nthese moraines is determined of course by the nature of the country over\r\nwhich the stream of ice is flowing. Bowlders of enormous size have been\r\ncarried for hundreds of miles, and the experienced geologist is able to\r\nexamine any one of them and tell us where its home was before the\r\nglacial period. Moraines are divided into different classes according to\r\ntheir position and constitution. The moraine found at the extreme limit\r\nof ice-flow is called the \"terminal\" moraine, as before mentioned. Those\r\nthat are found inside of this line and between two flows are called\r\n\"medial\" moraines. There is a subdivision called \"kettle\" or \"gravel\"\r\nmoraines, which are very prominent in northern Illinois and southern\r\nWisconsin, and may be said to culminate in the vicinity of Madison. This\r\nmoraine is a great deposit of gravelly soil. Where this moraine exists\r\nthe face of the country is covered with \"kettle holes\" of all sizes and\r\nshapes, and in some of them there are small lakes, while others are dry.\r\nThe great chain of inland lakes that are found in southern Wisconsin and\r\nnorthern Illinois were formed by deposits of ice that had been covered\r\nby glacial drift, gravel and otherwise, brought down and deposited upon\r\nthese masses of ice which gradually melted away, leaving a depression at\r\nthe points where they lay, while the drift that was piled around them\r\nloomed up and became the shores of the lake. This is substantially Dr.\r\nWright's theory, who studied the formation of these \"kettle holes\" at\r\nthe mouth of the Muir glacier. This enthusiastic glacialist has spent\r\nmany summers tracing the terminal moraine with its fringe along the\r\nlines heretofore indicated. He is, therefore, entitled to speak with\r\nauthority on matters of glacial action.\r\n\r\nThe part of the country that has been plowed over by these glaciers is\r\ncalled the glaciated area and the rest the unglaciated. The whole of\r\nNorth America north of the line of the terminal moraine that we have\r\ntraced is a glacial region, with the exception of a few hundred square\r\nmiles chiefly in Wisconsin, where the ice seemed to have parted and\r\npassed around this area, coming together again on the south side of it.\r\nThe ice probably did not reach the extreme limit that shows glacial\r\ndeposit, but undoubtedly the effects of it are seen for some distance to\r\nthe south, owing to the fact that during the time it was melting great\r\nquantities of water flowed away from the extreme edge of the ice,\r\ncarrying with it more or less of the glacial drift, which was deposited\r\nfor some distance to the south. When the ice receded it undoubtedly\r\npaused at different points, where it remained stationary for a long\r\nperiod of time. I mean stationary at its edges, for the flow of ice was\r\ncontinually moving, but in its progress southward it came to a point\r\nwhere the heat was sufficient to melt the ice as fast as it arrived at\r\nthat point. The on-moving ice was continually bringing with it the\r\ndebris that it had gathered up at different points on its journey, so\r\nthat it is easy to see how these moraines could accumulate to a greater\r\nor less depth at the margin of the ice flow, which would be determined\r\nby the duration of the period it remained stationary. This, however, is\r\nonly one factor, as the surface of the earth in some parts of the\r\ncountry would be more easily picked up and carried than in others;\r\ntherefore, the drift accumulated much more rapidly in some sections than\r\nin others.\r\n\r\nAnother factor that was active in the more rapid accumulation at certain\r\npoints was the speed at which the ice moved, and this would be\r\ndetermined by the pressure that was behind it, and there would always be\r\nlines of unequal pressure existing in such a great glacier as must have\r\nexisted when these moraines were formed.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the difference in the glacial deposits that are made\r\nin different periods during the time of the melting of the great ice\r\nsheet we may compare the Kettle Moraines of Wisconsin with the clay\r\ndeposit mixed with broken gravel that we find along the west coast of\r\nLake Michigan. Those whose homes are situated between Winnetka and\r\nWaukegan on the lake shore have the foundations of their houses set in\r\nglacial drift that was shoved into position by the ice during the\r\nglacial period.\r\n\r\nAnyone who makes an examination of the bluffs along the shore of this\r\nlake will notice that there is no stratification whatever to the deposit\r\nsuch as will always be found in an unglaciated region. Going west from\r\nthe bluff a few miles we come down to the prairie level, where we find\r\nthe soil of an entirely different nature. The soil of the prairies of\r\nIllinois and Iowa is probably to a great extent a water deposit. It is\r\nthe kind we find in the bottom of a pond that has stood for many years,\r\nand it would seem that at some period all this prairie country with the\r\nblack soil was the bottom of a great lake.\r\n\r\nThe facts of a glacial period are beyond question, but when it occurred,\r\nand how it occurred are questions that many have tried to answer. So\r\nfar, all that we can say of them is that some of them are shrewd\r\nguesses. The evidences adduced for determining the time, are the erosion\r\ncaused by rivers and streams since the ice subsided. Some of the rivers\r\nand outlets of lakes had their courses changed by the action of the ice,\r\nso that when it subsided new water courses were formed, and the erosion\r\nthat they have produced from that time to the present furnishes the data\r\nfor determining the time since the subsidence of the ice at any\r\nparticular point. For instance, Niagara Falls was undoubtedly at one\r\ntime situated at Queenstown, a number of miles below its present\r\nposition. And the time that it has taken to grind out the great gorge\r\nthat exists between that point and the present falls is approximately a\r\nmeasure of the time that has elapsed since the subsidence of the ice at\r\nthat point. Various estimates have been made to determinate the rate of\r\nerosion. The earlier ones put the time at about 35,000 years. But there\r\nare later investigators who make the time much shorter, not over 10,000\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSo much for the time; but you ask What about the occasion, or cause?\r\nThis is a question that many have attempted to answer, there having been\r\neight or ten theories promulgated with regard to the cause of the\r\nglacial period, but no one of them is entirely satisfactory, and only\r\ntwo or three of them are deserving of much discussion. It is always\r\ninteresting to know what people think, however, even if we do not agree\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe first theory named is that the glacial period is due to the decrease\r\nof the original heat in our climate. This theory can be dismissed by\r\nsaying that the planet was cooling at the time and has been cooling ever\r\nsince, and that the reasons for an ice age are greater now than then, on\r\nthat theory. Another theory assumes that at some former period there was\r\na greater amount of moisture in the atmosphere; while this of course\r\nwould be the occasion for greater precipitation of snow, it does not\r\naccount for the changing conditions that would produce the ice effect.\r\nThat there was a preglacial period there is abundant evidence, in buried\r\nforests, the filling up and changing of river beds, and other evidences\r\nthat will be referred to further on. This theory, unmodified and stated\r\nbroadly, is not satisfactory. Another way of accounting for the glacial\r\nperiod is the change in the distribution of land and water, which is\r\nsupposed to affect the distribution of heat over the earth's surface.\r\nThere is much in this theory that commends itself as plausible. Another\r\ntheory supposes that the land in northern Europe and America was\r\nelevated to a higher level at that time than it is now. Others attribute\r\nit to variation of temperature in space and of the amount of heat\r\nradiated by the sun. The final theory for accounting for the ice age is\r\nattributed to what is termed the precession of the equinoxes. In short,\r\nthe precession of the equinoxes means that the division between summer\r\nand winter is changing gradually, so that during a period of 10,500\r\nyears the summers are growing longer in the northern hemisphere and the\r\nwinters shorter. We are now in the period of long summers, but in\r\nanother 10,000 years we shall be in the period of short summers and long\r\nwinters. This difference of time between the winters and the summers is\r\nsupposed to be sufficient to change the thermal conditions sufficiently\r\nto produce an ice age.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the conditions now are very evenly balanced, so much so\r\nthat in Switzerland the glaciers will increase for some years together,\r\nwhen the conditions will change, causing them to gradually recede.\r\nSeveral of the theories that have been advanced present evidences that\r\nare entitled to careful consideration, but none of them can be said to\r\nbe entirely satisfactory. It is well known that the chief factors in the\r\nproduction of glaciers are moisture and cold. Cold alone is not\r\nsufficient; neither is moisture, unless we can precipitate it in the\r\nform of snow. Cold is opposed to the production of moisture, and this is\r\na flaw in the argument presented by the last theory, unless we can\r\ncouple with it another set of conditions which we will discuss later.\r\n\r\nThe solution, if it is ever reached, is perhaps more likely to be found\r\nin the realm of meteorology than geology.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to change the conditions of temperature or the amount\r\nof moisture now existing in order to produce the great glacier again,\r\nprovided this moisture could be precipitated, enough of it, in the right\r\nplace as snow. For instance, if in Switzerland, where the conditions are\r\nnearly balanced, the annual precipitation could be slightly increased we\r\nshould have a condition that would precipitate more snow in winter than\r\nwould melt in summer. And the glaciers would gradually accumulate in\r\nsize until they would fill the valleys and gorges to the same extent as\r\nformerly prevailed. There only needs to be such a change in the\r\nmeteorological conditions as will cause a greater precipitation in that\r\npart of the globe favorable to glaciers, as, for instance, in the\r\nnorthern part of North America toward Alaska. This might be produced by\r\na change in the conditions of the equatorial current, so that\r\nevaporation would be more rapid in the northern Pacific than it now is.\r\nWhen we consider that evaporation increases in proportion as the heat\r\nincreases, we can see that heat is just as important a factor in the\r\nproduction of glaciers as cold. If evaporation could be increased in the\r\nPacific Ocean west of Alaska, which would be carried by the wind over\r\nthe mountains upon the land, and precipitated as snow, the great\r\nglaciers in that region would begin to grow instead of gradually\r\nreceding, as is the case at present, and this without any change in the\r\ntemperature of the world as a whole or in the amount of heat received\r\nfrom the sun. One can readily see how changes in the elevation of the\r\nbottom of the ocean would have such an effect upon the tropical stream\r\nas would either increase or decrease the temperature of the thermal\r\nriver that flows up the western coast of Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the cause that created the great ice age in North\r\nAmerica, so that a sheet of ice covered considerably more than half of\r\nthe continent, there is no doubt in regard to the fact of the existence\r\nof such an age, and it will be interesting to study some of the physical\r\nchanges that have been made by the ice at that period on the surface of\r\nthe glaciated area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nGLACIAL AND PREGLACIAL LAKES AND RIVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the recession of the ice, preglacial lakes have been filled up and\r\nare now dry land, and river beds have been changed so that new channels\r\nhave been cut and new lakes have been formed. Even the imagination, that\r\nwonderful architect, with all its tendencies to exaggeration, palls in\r\nits attempt to give expression in measured quantities to the mighty\r\npower exerted by the great glacier or combination of glaciers that\r\nexisted in comparatively recent times. I say recent times, because even\r\n10,000 years is only a mere point of time when compared with the actual\r\nage of our globe.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, in company with Dr. Wright, author of the \"Ice Age in\r\nNorth America,\" I visited Devil's Lake near Baraboo, Wis. At this point\r\nare striking evidences of the work of the ice age. Before the glacial\r\nperiod the Wisconsin River made a detour some miles west of its present\r\nchannel through the high hills in the region of Baraboo. The hills on\r\neach side of Devil's Lake are very precipitous and are formed almost\r\nentirely of rocks. The river at that point passed between two of these\r\nhills. When the ice flowed down it surrounded these hills, yet did not\r\nsweep over their tops, but left great piles of glacial drift, both at\r\nthe points where the river channel entered the hills and where it\r\nemerges from them. The channel between the hills was protected and not\r\nfilled with the debris. Therefore a deep basin was left, which is kept\r\nfilled by the watershed furnished by the surrounding hills. This lake\r\nrecedes many feet during the summer, but it is again filled up by the\r\nrains and snows of winter. There is no considerable stream either\r\nflowing into or out from it. It is a lake formed by the glaciers, but in\r\na different way from those in the gravel deposits at other parts of\r\nsouthern Wisconsin and northern Illinois.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds and perhaps thousands of lakes that have been formed\r\nin one way or another through the power of glacial action. These smaller\r\ninland lakes, so many of which are seen in northern Illinois, southern\r\nWisconsin, and Minnesota, are due almost entirely to the great deposits\r\nof glacial drift that have been transported with the ice. Wherever these\r\n\"kettle holes\" are found large bodies of ice have become anchored,\r\nwhile the ice behind it has carried the drift until it is covered over\r\nand piled up at the sides. When these ice mountains melted away\r\ndepressions were left which in some cases have resulted in lakes, and in\r\nothers simply dry kettle holes. This process has been hinted at in a\r\nformer chapter, but we give it here as one of the kinds of lakes formed\r\nduring the glacial period. They are found everywhere that glacial action\r\nhas prevailed. They are found in great abundance in some parts of New\r\nEngland on the margin of the terminal moraine. These lakes, however, are\r\ncomparatively insignificant as compared with the great inland seas like\r\nLake Superior and Lake Michigan, that undoubtedly owe their origin\r\nlargely to the ice age.\r\n\r\nThere are other factors, however, that enter into the formation of the\r\ngreat chain of lakes on the northern boundary of the United States\r\nbesides those mentioned, that have brought into existence the smaller\r\ninland lakes.\r\n\r\nGlacial lakes may be divided into three classes. Those found in the\r\n\"kettle holes\" of the terminal or medial moraines, and those that are\r\nformed by the deposition of the glacial drift, as, for instance, Devil's\r\nLake, and those that are caused by ice forming dams across the valley of\r\na river that lasted only during the ice age. In some lakes of the\r\nsecond class erosion undoubtedly entered into their formation as well as\r\nthe piling up of glacial drift.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, that we may understand more fully the formation of\r\nthese greater lakes it will be necessary for us to go back and examine\r\nthe conditions that seem to have existed before the glacial period.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact well known that continents have periods of elevation and\r\ndepression. There is abundant evidence that the northern portion of the\r\nNorth American continent was elevated to a much higher level in\r\npreglacial times than it occupies now. This is evidenced in very many\r\nways by sounding the depths of old river beds now filled with glacial\r\ndebris. The old beds show unmistakable evidences of having been worn\r\ndown to their present level by the action of running water. They also\r\nprove to be many feet below the present sea-level. This fact seems to be\r\nsufficient to prove the theory of a higher elevation of the North\r\nAmerican continent in preglacial times. It should be said here that\r\nundoubtedly the constant filling up of the ocean with the drift carried\r\ndown by the rivers has somewhat raised its level, but hardly to the\r\nextent indicated by the old river beds. The question naturally arises,\r\nWhere did all the dirt come from to fill up these great river beds and\r\nchange the whole topography of the northern half of the continent? Dr.\r\nWright estimates that there is not less than 1,000,000 square miles of\r\nterritory in North America covered with glacial debris to an average\r\ndepth of 50 feet. Of course, the depth varies in different places from a\r\nfew inches to several hundred feet. Of the carrying power of these great\r\nglaciers we will speak more fully in a future chapter. In preglacial\r\ntimes the watershed of the Mississippi and of the great rivers east of\r\nthe Alleghany Mountains, the Susquehanna and Hudson, extended probably\r\nfarther north than it does to-day. The larger portion of the drainage\r\narea that now finds an outlet through the River St. Lawrence at one time\r\nundoubtedly drained off through the Mississippi Valley into the Gulf and\r\nthe Valley of the Mohawk into that of the Hudson.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed by those who have made this branch of geology a study\r\nthat prior to the glacial period a river flowed down through Lake\r\nSuperior, which connected with Lake Michigan at a point near its present\r\noutlet at Sault Ste. Marie, the channel of the river passing down\r\nthrough what is now the bottom of Lake Michigan, which had an outlet at\r\nthe head of the lake near Chicago and flowed off into the Mississippi\r\nRiver. All of the lake bottoms of this great chain, with the exception\r\nof Lake Erie, are now below sea-level. The reason for this exception\r\nwill appear further on. Before the ice age there was supposed to be no\r\nconnection between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, as there is now,\r\nthrough the Straits of Mackinac.\r\n\r\nAnother preglacial river had its rise in the region of Lake Huron and\r\nflowed through an old river bed extending from the Georgian Bay in a\r\nsoutheasterly direction through the province of Ontario, and emptied\r\ninto the present Lake Ontario. From Lake Ontario there is an old river\r\nbed running through the Valley of the Mohawk which empties into the\r\nHudson at Troy. Neither of these two rivers, having their sources in the\r\nnorth, found an outlet through the present St. Lawrence River. During\r\nthe time of the glacial period there is evidence that there was more\r\nthan one center of snow and ice accumulation and each of these great\r\ncenters probably had several subcenters. This theory has color given to\r\nit by the directions of movement shown by the glacial drift.\r\n\r\nThe rounded appearance of bowlders was caused by the grinding action of\r\nthe ice. These bowlders, when they were first torn from their rocky beds\r\nby the irresistible power of ice pressure, were rough and jagged in\r\nshape, the same as any rock would be, torn from a quarry by a blast.\r\nThey have been smoothed and rounded by rubbing against the moving ice\r\nand against each other in the progress of their long journey from their\r\noriginal homes. Where their home was the geologist can immediately tell\r\nupon examination. It is only necessary then to examine the bowlders of\r\nany particular locality to determine the direction of the ice flow at\r\nthat point.\r\n\r\nThere seem to have existed centers of ice accumulation to the north of\r\nall of the great lakes. And when they had grown to a sufficient height\r\nthey joined at their edges, making one grand glacier, the movements of\r\nwhich were the resultant of the combined pressure exerted by these great\r\ncenters of power, so that all of North America north of the line of the\r\nterminal moraine, with the exception of a small area (heretofore noted)\r\nchiefly in Wisconsin, became covered with one vast sheet of ice.\r\n\r\nThe glacier north of Lake Superior widened out the old river bed by a\r\nprocess of erosion to its present width.\r\n\r\nThere may have existed something of a lake in preglacial times, through\r\nwhich the river ran, but it undoubtedly owes its present width to the\r\ngrinding action of the irresistible icebergs and the piling up of debris\r\non the shores. The river bed was filled up by a glacial drift at the\r\npoint of its present outlet until the lake was raised in its level much\r\nhigher than that of Lake Michigan. Another glacier plowed down through\r\nLake Michigan, widening it out to its present dimensions, while the\r\nglacial drift was deposited at what is now the head of the lake, filling\r\nup the old outlet and thus making a great dam. The damming up of these\r\ngreat water courses was another cause for increasing the width of these\r\nlakes. In a similar way Lake Erie was formed. It is supposed, however,\r\nthat this lake is entirely the product of glacial action, as there is no\r\nevidence of an old river bed in its bottom; besides, it is much\r\nshallower than the other lakes. The same action that formed Lake Erie\r\nfilled up the old river bed running through the province of Ontario, so\r\nthat when the ice receded Lake Erie became the new channel for the old\r\nriver. The same process filled up the Valley of the Mohawk to more than\r\n100 feet in depth and also raised the Valley of the Hudson. This caused\r\nthe new channel to be made through the Niagara River and a new route to\r\nthe ocean for the drainage of all the chain of lakes through the St.\r\nLawrence. It will be seen that the bottoms of all of these great lakes\r\nto a certain extent were worn out by the action of running water, except\r\nErie. The great glaciers widened them out, and in the case of Lake Erie\r\nscooped it out. At the same time it built great dams across the outlets\r\nwhich raised the surface of the water to a much higher level and caused\r\nthem to form new outlets, thus changing the whole face of the country\r\nover which the ice drifted.\r\n\r\nThe glaciated region of North America is among the most productive in\r\nthe world, and in many respects presents a most pleasing landscape.\r\n\r\nOther lakes besides these mentioned have been formed during the ice\r\nperiod through blocking the course of a river by the ice itself. Dr.\r\nWright, during the time he traced out the line of the terminal moraine,\r\ndiscovered that the ice sheet crossed the Ohio River at a point near\r\nCincinnati, where there is a great bend to the northward in the river.\r\nWith the exception of this point and perhaps another point below, the\r\nedge of the great ice sheet kept a little north of the Ohio River. At\r\nthis point, however, the ice seems to have filled the valley from hill\r\nto hill, which very naturally would form a great dam or lake in the Ohio\r\nValley. Of course such a lake could not be permanent, because, when the\r\nice melted away, it again opened the channel and allowed the water to\r\nflow off.\r\n\r\nSome years before this discovery was made there were terraces found\r\nalong the banks of the Ohio River and its tributaries that had been the\r\nsubject of much speculation. It is well known that by the action of\r\nwater from rainfall, earth, gravel, and other debris will wash down the\r\nside of a hill or mountain until it strikes a water level, and there it\r\nwill build out a terrace near the level of the water surface. The width\r\nof these terraces will be determined by the time the water has stood at\r\nthat level and the extent and nature of the soil from which the debris\r\ncomes. The evidences that are cited, pro and con, would fill a small\r\nvolume, but it is sufficient to say here that the sum of the evidence\r\ngoes to show that there was an ice dam formed at a point near Cincinnati\r\nand that it was maintained for a considerable period of time. Terraces\r\nwere formed running up the Ohio and its tributaries corresponding to the\r\nlevel that the water must have risen to if the valley were filled up\r\nwith ice. These facts, taken with the greater fact that the ice sheet\r\nactually did cross the Ohio Valley into Kentucky, as is shown by the\r\nterminal moraine, seems to prove conclusively the existence of such a\r\nlake during the period that the ice rested at its extreme limit. The\r\nfact that in some places successive terraces are found does not disprove\r\nthe theory, because it is more than likely that when the ice receded it\r\ndid so in successive stages, remaining at different positions for a\r\nconsiderable length of time. There is abundant proof of this in the\r\nsuccessive moraines and also in the formation of successive terraces.\r\nSome of these terraces could have been formed from other causes.\r\n\r\nIt does not require any great stretch of the imagination to understand\r\nhow numerous lakes, much larger than any at the present day, may have\r\nextended over large portions of the West and Northwest during the period\r\nthat the ice was receding. The ice did not stand with an even thickness\r\nover the surface of the glaciated area, but at some points it moved down\r\nin great lobes, which marked the lines of greatest pressure as well as\r\nthe greatest accumulation. As the ice melted away, the thick bodies of\r\nice might be many, many years in melting, and they might block the\r\noutlet to a very extensive drainage area and thus form a great inland\r\nsea from the vast amounts of water that would come from the melting ice.\r\n\r\nAll of the region about Winnipeg, in the Red River country, covering\r\ngreat areas of hundreds of miles in extent, is a level plain only\r\nlacking the coloring to give to one passing through it the effect of a\r\ngreat unruffled sea. There is no doubt but that all of this region was\r\nthe bottom of a great lake at some period when the ice was receding. And\r\nthis accounts for the great depth of black soil that we find in this and\r\nother regions. The soil was a water deposit, such as may be found in the\r\nbottom of any shallow lake or pond to-day, and thus many thousand years\r\nago provision was made for the fertile areas which to-day are feeding\r\nthe world with wheat.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine that during this period the water that flowed off\r\nthrough the great Mississippi must have been of enormous volume as\r\ncompared to the present time. A large portion of the delta of the\r\nMississippi which now is a part of the States of Louisiana and\r\nMississippi was carried down during the ice-melting period. Dr.\r\nWright--as we have before stated--has estimated that there are a million\r\nsquare miles of country that has been covered to an average depth of\r\nfifty feet with glacial drift. A very large amount of the earth that was\r\nspread over the northern portion of the United States by leveling down\r\nhills and mountains in the northern country and scooping out the great\r\nlakes has been carried much farther than to the margin of the ice sheet.\r\nAnd I have no doubt but that a great portion of Louisiana and western\r\nMississippi is made of earth carried down largely during the period of\r\nmelting ice and deposited in this great delta.\r\n\r\nImagine the effect that would be produced by the giving way of an ice\r\ndam or a great number of them at different periods, that would allow a\r\nbody of water as large or larger than Lake Michigan to be drained off in\r\na comparatively short time. When we think of it in this light the great\r\ndelta of the Mississippi is easily accounted for.\r\n\r\nThere are evidences of a great lake in the Red River country of the\r\nNorthwest that is much larger than any of our greatest lakes. The\r\nshores of this lake--the bed of which is now dry land and the heart of a\r\ngreat agricultural region--are well defined and have been surveyed and\r\nmapped out. When this great body of water was released it was to the\r\nnorthward. For this reason it was undoubtedly held for a much longer\r\ntime than some of the lakes to the southward where the ice melted\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nSOME EFFECTS OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderfully interesting effect produced by the action of\r\nwater during the subsidence of a glacier at Lucerne, Switzerland. Some\r\nyears ago there was discovered under a pile of glacial drift at the edge\r\nof the town of Lucerne a number of deep holes worn in a great ledge of\r\nrocks that crop out at that point. One of these pot-holes having been\r\ndiscovered, excavations were continued until a large number of them were\r\nunearthed of various shapes and sizes. I had the pleasure of inspecting\r\nsome of them in the year 1881. They are situated within an inclosure\r\ncalled the Garden of the Glaciers. Some of these holes are twenty to\r\nthirty feet in diameter, and the same depth. There are others that are\r\nsmaller in size, but all of them possess the same general\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom of each one was found a bowlder, and in one or two cases\r\ntwo of them. The action of the water had given these bowlders a gyratory\r\nmotion, which gradually wore away the rock underneath until round holes\r\nwere formed to the size and depth heretofore mentioned. Where there was\r\nonly a single bowlder the holes were almost perfectly round, but where\r\nthere was more than one bowlder the holes were sometimes in an oblong\r\nshape. The bowlders were worn down to a very small size in most cases,\r\nand were round and smooth. The probabilities are that when the action\r\nfirst began these bowlders were large and of irregular shape. They must\r\nhave been, in order to do the enormous amount of grinding that some of\r\nthem did to produce excavations in the solid rock with a diameter of\r\nthirty feet and a depth about the same. The bottoms were round like an\r\nold-fashioned pot, and the insides polished perfectly smooth. This was\r\npurely an effect of the tumbling about of the bowlders by the running\r\nwater from the melting ice of the great glacier that covered that region\r\nsome time in the long ago.\r\n\r\nThere are other effects produced in rocks during the ice flow in North\r\nAmerica that are very interesting. Great grooves are formed in the\r\nrocks, in many cases running for long distances, that have been worn in\r\nby the cutting power of the great ice sheet during the progress of its\r\nmovement. There is a great groove to be seen at Kelly's Island in Lake\r\nErie. It will be remembered that this lake is supposed to have been\r\nformed entirely by the ice of the glacial period. In its movement\r\nacross the country which is now covered by the lake the ice encountered\r\na huge rock formation at Kelly's Island. Great V-shaped grooves were cut\r\nthrough this rock by the action of the ice, deep enough for a man to\r\nstand in. In other places the rock was planed off in the form of a great\r\nmolding, a number of feet wide, with the same smoothness and accuracy as\r\nthough done by a machine.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of the glacial period has been the creation of numerous\r\nwaterfalls throughout the glaciated area. The most notable instance is\r\nthat of the Falls of Niagara.\r\n\r\nIn preglacial times the beds of all rivers and water courses had worn\r\ndown to an even slope, so that there were very few, if any, waterfalls\r\nsuch as we have to-day. As we have before stated, Niagara River as well\r\nas the St. Lawrence River is a new outlet for the drainage of the great\r\nlakes. A part of this drainage formerly had its outlet through the\r\nMohawk Valley into the Hudson, which is now filled up with glacial\r\ndrift. The evidence is so conclusive that it is no longer doubted that\r\nthe Niagara River dates from the time that the ice receded from that\r\npoint. When the water first began to flow through this new channel it\r\nplunged over the high rocky cliff at Queenstown, and from that time to\r\nthis it has been wearing its way back to the present position of\r\nNiagara Falls, a distance of about seven miles. A vast amount of\r\ninterest centers about this river because it is the best evidence we\r\nhave of the time that has expired since the glacial period. A great deal\r\nof study has been given to determine the amount of erosion at the Falls\r\nduring a year's time. If this could be accurately determined, then by\r\nmeasuring the distance from the present falls to Queenstown, we could\r\neasily determine the number of years since the ice period. It is\r\ndifficult to determine, for the conditions may have changed; for\r\ninstance, the rock at the Falls to-day is said to be harder than it is\r\nfurther down toward Queenstown. The estimates vary from 35,000 years to\r\n10,000 years--that is, from a rate of erosion of five feet to one foot,\r\nper year.\r\n\r\nEvery science is, nearly or remotely, related to every other science. If\r\nwe could determine accurately the date of the ice period it would settle\r\na whole lot of other questions that are related to it, and one of them\r\nis the antiquity of man. Many stone implements such as were made and\r\nused by the aborigines have been found at various times buried deeply\r\nunder the glacial drift. These finds have occurred so often that there\r\nno longer remains a doubt but that a race of men existed on this\r\ncontinent in preglacial times. There are evidences that at a time long\r\nago the temperate zone extended far north of this, and it is not\r\nimpossible that what is now the continent of Asia and that of North\r\nAmerica were joined. In fact, they come very close together to-day at\r\nBering Strait. If such were the case this continent could have been\r\ninhabited from the old world by an overland route. This, however, is\r\nmere speculation. There are a number of factors that are taken into\r\naccount in determining the period of the ice age besides the Niagara\r\nRiver and the Falls. The Falls of St. Anthony at Minneapolis (which like\r\nthe Niagara is a creature of the ice age), the wear of water on the\r\nshores of the great lakes, the newness of the rocks that are piled up on\r\nthe terminal moraines, all point to a much shorter period since the ice\r\nage than it used to be supposed, and indicate that the time does not\r\nexceed 10,000 years.\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary mind the ice age no doubt seems like a myth, but to the\r\nman of science who has made a study of all of these evidences it is as\r\nreal as any fact in history, and much more real than some of the history\r\nwe read. In the former case we are dealing with evidences that appeal to\r\nour senses, while in the latter we are dealing with the recollections of\r\nmen concerning what purport to have been actual transactions, and we\r\nknow enough about the human mind to make it difficult sometimes to draw\r\nthe line between the actual and the imaginary.\r\n\r\nThe glacial period is not only closely related to the topography of\r\nNorth America and parts of Europe in the changing of river beds, the\r\nformation of lakes, the transportation of rock, the grinding down of\r\nmountains and spreading the debris over thousands of miles in extent,\r\nbut it is related in an intimate way to many of the sciences, such as\r\nbotany and zooelogy. A study of the flight of animals and plants in front\r\nof the great advancing ice sheet is a subject of intense interest. The\r\nmigration of great forests would seem to be an impossible thing when\r\nviewed from the standpoint of a casual observer. It is true that\r\nindividual trees could not take themselves up and move forward in\r\nadvance of the oncoming ice, but they could and did send their children\r\non ahead, and when the ice had overtaken the children there were still\r\nthe children's children ad infinitum.\r\n\r\nBy an examination of the map it will be seen that the land gathers about\r\nthe north pole, while the south pole is surrounded chiefly by great\r\noceans. As we have hinted before, in preglacial times the temperate zone\r\nextended much farther north than it does to-day, and north of that there\r\nwas an arctic zone (which to-day is largely covered with ice sheets),\r\nwhere forests, plants, and animals flourished that were fitted for an\r\narctic climate. When the glacial period set in and the ice sheet began\r\nits southern journey this zone or climate was moved southward in front\r\nof the ice, thus forming, as it were, a moving zone whose climatic\r\nconditions were similar to those of the arctic regions (at least so far\r\nas temperature was concerned) in preglacial times. The ice movement was\r\nso gradual that time was given for forests to spring up in advance of it\r\nthat moved southward at about the same rate as that of the moving ice.\r\nUndoubtedly the average movement was very slow and was probably\r\nthousands of years reaching its southernmost limit, which is now marked\r\nby the terminal moraine. Thus it will be seen that while the individual\r\ntrees and plants could not move, the forest as a whole could. It was\r\ngradually being cut down on its northern limit and as gradually it grew\r\nup on the southern limit of the zone; the ice movement being so slow\r\nthat the young tree of to-day on the southern limit becomes a full-grown\r\nking of the forest by the time the relentless icebergs reach it and cut\r\nit down and thus the process went on until the plants, trees, and\r\nanimals of the arctic region were driven hundreds of miles south of the\r\ngreat chain of lakes on the northern boundary of the United States.\r\n\r\nMany of the animals of preglacial times were unable to stand the strain\r\nof the ever-changing climatic conditions and have become extinct, but\r\ntheir fossil remains are left to tell the story to the present and\r\nfuture ages. Much of the history of those times is a sealed book, but\r\nthe persevering energy of the glacialist and archaeologist is gradually\r\nturning the leaves of this old book and revealing new chapters of the\r\nwonderful story of the ice.\r\n\r\nAs the ice receded the arctic zone again traveled northward, and many\r\nanimals, plants, and trees that had survived the vicissitudes of the ice\r\nage, traveled back with it. Some of them, however, became acclimated and\r\nby adapting themselves to the new conditions remained behind to live and\r\ngrow with the aborigines of preglacial times. Some of the plants and\r\nflowers that grew in profusion immediately under the edge of the great\r\nice sheet were unable to live under the new conditions of increased\r\nwarmth--that came with the retrograde movement of the ice--and either\r\nhad to follow closely the receding ice or escape to higher altitudes,\r\nwhere they found a congenial clime. Thus it is that we have arctic\r\nplants and flowers above the timber line and near the snow line of our\r\nhigh mountains. In proof of this theory it has been found that these\r\narctic plants do not exist upon high mountains, such as the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, where they have been isolated from the glaciated region. The\r\nPeak of Teneriffe is situated on one of the Canary Islands, surrounded\r\nby water, so that there was no possible chance for the arctic plants to\r\nseek refuge on these isolated elevations, such as the continental\r\nmountains furnish.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that the progression and recession of the ice have\r\nnot only formed great lakes, changed river beds, and covered a million\r\nsquare miles of area with glacial drift averaging fifty feet in depth,\r\nmaking many waterfalls and giving variety to the surface of the earth,\r\nbesides producing the finest agricultural region in the world, but have\r\nalso given variety to our forests and plants wherever this ice sheet has\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE BEFORE THE ICE AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already said that during the ice age river-beds were changed,\r\nvalleys were filled up, new lakes were made, and waterfalls created.\r\nGreat as were the changes made by the carrying power of moving ice,\r\nstill greater were those made in preglacial times; not, however, from\r\nthe action of moving ice, but from running water. Erosion caused by\r\nrunning water has, probably, during the life of the world, transported\r\nmore material from place to place, from mountain to valley, and from\r\nvalley to ocean, than any other agency; chiefly for the reason that it\r\nhas been so much longer doing its work.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Ohio River, a thousand miles or more in length,\r\ntogether with the great number of feeders that empty into it, is an\r\ninstance of the wonderful erosive power of running water. The valley of\r\nthe Ohio River will probably average a mile in width at its upper level\r\nand, deep as it is to-day, it was much deeper in preglacial times. There\r\nis evidence that the whole bed of the river was from 100 to 150 feet\r\ndeeper than it is at present. This has been determined by borings at\r\ndifferent points to ascertain the depth of the drift that was lodged\r\nduring the glacial period in the trough of the Ohio River. Anyone\r\ntraveling up or down the river to-day can readily see that it is a great\r\nsinuous groove cut down through the earth by millions of years of water\r\nerosion, and not only this, but that at some time in its history this\r\ngreat valley has been partly filled, forming on one or both sides of the\r\nriver level areas--called bottom land. These lands are exceedingly\r\nproductive, owing to the great depth and richness of the soil.\r\n\r\nFor many years the writer lived upon one of the rivers tributary to the\r\nOhio and often made trips by steamboat up and down the Ohio River.\r\nTraveling along this river a close observer will be struck by the\r\nexactness of the stratifications in the rock and in the coal beds to be\r\nseen on each side of the river. They match as perfectly as the grain of\r\na block of wood when sawn asunder--showing that these coal beds were\r\nformed at an age long before the water cut this sinuous groove. What the\r\nwater was doing while these coal beds were forming will be brought out\r\nin some future chapter. All the rivers that are tributary to the Ohio,\r\nsuch as the Monongahela, the Alleghany, the Muskingum, the Tennessee,\r\nthe Cumberland, the Kentucky, the Wabash, the Miami, the Licking, the\r\nScioto, the Big Sandy, the Kanawha, the Hocking, and the Great Beaver,\r\nbesides numerous smaller streams, have their own valleys that have been\r\nworn away by the same process, and to a greater depth than they now\r\nappear to be. All of the material that once filled these valleys has\r\nbeen carried down by the water filling up the bottom of the ocean and\r\nbuilding out the great delta of the lower Mississippi. Mountains have\r\nbeen worn down and carried away by the action of the running water until\r\ntheir height is much lower than in former times. The great lakes, that\r\nwere enlarged during the glacial period and in some cases wholly\r\ncreated--by the scooping out and damming up of the waterways and by\r\npiling glacial drift around their shores--have had some of their outlets\r\nraised to a higher level, and others have been created anew.\r\n\r\nThe old river beds that formerly carried the water that is now drained\r\nthrough the St. Lawrence were eroded by the action of running water to a\r\ngreat depth, as is shown by numerous borings along the valley of the\r\nMohawk and down the Hudson. The salt wells at Syracuse, N. Y., have been\r\nput down through glacial drifts and the salt water is found in the bed\r\nof the old river. Great bodies of salt are found at that low level,\r\nconstantly dissolved by the water percolating through the sand and\r\ngravel of the glacial drift. This salt water is pumped up and\r\nevaporated, leaving the salt--forming one of the important industries of\r\nthat region. All of the rivers from the Ohio eastward tell the same\r\nstory, which is that at some remote period the land was much higher\r\nabove the level of the sea than it is to-day. The bottoms of many of\r\nthese old river beds are lower than sea-level, but as they were made by\r\nrunning water they must have been at one time above that point.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that the earth sinks in some places and rises\r\nin others. Along the ridges of some of the eastern mountains are found\r\nin great abundance the products of the bottom of the ocean. These\r\nevidences show that at some period, when the mountains were formed, a\r\ngreat convulsion of nature raised the bottom of the ocean to thousands\r\nof feet above its level. Evidences of this exist in various parts not\r\nonly of the United States, but of the world.\r\n\r\nYou ask, If this erosion goes on and the mountains and hills are carried\r\ndown and filled in to the low places of the ocean, what is the final\r\ndestiny of the earth that now appears above the surface of the ocean?\r\nEvidently if the earth should remain without further upheaval, at some\r\ntime in the far, far future the land would gradually wear down and be\r\ncarried off into the ocean and the ocean would gradually rise, owing to\r\nits restricted area, until it would again cover the whole earth as it\r\nundoubtedly did at one time in the earth's history. This fact need not\r\noccasion any uneasiness on the part of those who are living to-day or\r\nfor millions of years to come.\r\n\r\nThe problem of building a world and then tearing it to pieces is a very\r\ncomplicated one. There is a constant battle going on between the powers\r\nthat build up and those that tear down; and this is as true of\r\ncharacter-building as it is of world-building. The world has never been\r\nexactly alike any two successive days from the time its foundations were\r\nlaid to the present moment. It seems to be a fundamental law of all life\r\nand growth, as well as of all decay, that there shall be a constant\r\nchange. There is no such thing as rest in nature. The smallest molecules\r\nand atoms of matter are in constant agitation. In the animal and\r\nvegetable world there is a period of life and growth, and a period of\r\ndecay and death; and this seems to be the destiny of planets themselves\r\nas well as the things that live and grow upon them. Still, science\r\nteaches us that with all this turmoil and change nothing either of\r\nmatter or energy is lost, but that it is simply undergoing one eternal\r\nround of change. Does this law apply to mind and soul? Do we die? Or do\r\nwe simply change?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNature's Miracles:\r\n\r\nFAMILIAR TALKS ON SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nBy PROF.
