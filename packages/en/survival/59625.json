Any farmer planning to grow\r\nhemp must comply with certain regulations of the Marihuana Tax Act of\r\n1937. This involves registration with the farmer's nearest Internal\r\nRevenue Collector and the payment of a fee of $1. Although the fee is\r\nsmall, the registration is mandatory and should not be neglected, as\r\nthe penalty provisions for not complying with the regulations are very\r\nsevere. The registration must be renewed each year beginning July 1.\r\nThis so-called \"license\" permits a farmer to obtain viable hempseed from\r\na registered firm dealing in hemp, to plant and grow the crop, and to\r\ndeliver mature, retted hemp stalks to a hemp mill.\r\n\r\n  Washington, D.

Robinson, _Senior Agrononmist_\r\n\r\n _Division of Cotton and Other Fiber Crops and Diseases Bureau of Plant\r\n   Industry, Soils, and Agricultural Engineering Agricultural Research\r\n                             Administration_\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMP is a fiber used in making twines and light cordage. It is also used\r\nas an extender for imported cordage fibers, particularly abaca, sisal,\r\nand henequen, when supplies of these are not adequate to meet domestic\r\ndemands. The size of the hemp industry, therefore, is greatly influenced\r\nby the availability of imported cordage fibers.\r\n\r\nHemp is not a hard crop to grow. It should be planted on the most\r\nproductive land on the farm--land that would make 50 to 70 bushels of\r\ncorn per acre.\r\n\r\nThe crop is planted with a grain drill and harvested with special\r\nmachinery rented from hemp mills.\r\n\r\nIt is allowed to lie on the ground until the outer part of the stalks has\r\nrotted, freeing the fibers. This process is called dew retting.\r\n\r\nThe most important step in hemp farming is to stop the retting process at\r\nthe proper time. (See pp. 12 and 13.)\r\n\r\nThis bulletin tells how to grow and harvest hemp. For more information\r\nwrite to the Bureau of Plant Industry, Soils, and Agricultural\r\nEngineering, United States Department of Agriculture, or to your State\r\nexperiment station, or consult your county agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_What it is_\r\n\r\n\r\nHemp is an annual plant that grows from seed each year, and therefore it\r\ncan be brought readily into production. It produces twice as much fiber\r\nper acre as flax, the only other fiber that is its equal in strength and\r\ndurability and that is known to be suitable for culture and preparation\r\non machinery in this country.\r\n\r\nWhen hempseed is sown thickly for fiber production, the plants usually\r\ngrow from 5 to 8 feet tall. However, when the plants are thinly spaced in\r\nrows for seed production, they may, under favorable conditions, reach a\r\nheight of 12 to 16 feet. If the plants are not crowded, they become much\r\nbranched and are bushy. Uniform stems approximately 3/8 inch in diameter\r\nand 5 to 8 feet long are especially desired for fiber production, because\r\nthey can be handled well by the harvesting and processing machinery\r\navailable in this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHemp is a dioecious plant, that is, the staminate (male) and pistillate\r\n(female) flowers are borne on separate plants, rather than both on one\r\nplant. The flowers of the two types of plants are different, but the male\r\nplant is easily distinguished from the female, as the anthers are about\r\nthe size of a wheat kernel. The male plants die soon after discharging\r\ntheir pollen; this is usually about 3 to 5 weeks before the female plants\r\nmature seed and die.\r\n\r\nThe fiber of commerce ranges from 4 to 8 feet in length and has the\r\nappearance of a flat, fine ribbon. It lies very close to the epidermis or\r\nskin of the plant. Spinners desire the fiber ribbon 1/16 inch or less in\r\nwidth. The long strands of fiber are called \"line\" fiber to distinguish\r\nthem from \"tow\" fiber, which consists of shorter, broken, tangled pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_It grows well in the Corn Belt_\r\n\r\n\r\nHemp is recommended as a good crop for the Corn Belt States, because of\r\ntheir favorable climatic and soil conditions.\r\n\r\nMost fiber-producing varieties of hemp require a frost-free growing\r\nseason of 5 months or longer to produce seed and approximately 4 months\r\nfor fiber production. Hemp will endure light frosts in the spring and\r\nsurvive frosts in the fall better than corn. It grows best when well\r\nsupplied with moisture throughout its growling season and especially in\r\nits early stages of growth. Drought conditions, if accompanied by high\r\ntemperatures, appear to hasten maturity before the plants are fully grown.\r\n\r\nThe vegetative growth of hemp should be uniform. This growth is\r\nnoticeably affected if the soil is flooded or saturated with moisture for\r\ntoo long a period. The leaves turn yellow, and the plants die. Rainfall,\r\nwell distributed during the growing season, is, therefore, desirable for\r\nuniform vegetative growth. Hemp should be planted only on well-drained\r\nsoils and not on flat, heavy, impervious soils.\r\n\r\nClimate is important not only in the growth of the plant but also in the\r\npreparation of the crop after harvest. It influences the method used in\r\nhandling the crop and the labor requirements, which determine the cost\r\nof production. In the United States the common practice (known as dew\r\nretting) is to cut the crop and let it lie on the ground. Exposure to the\r\nweather causes the fiber in the outer part of the stem to separate. Light\r\nsnows and alternate freezing and thawing seem to improve or make the\r\nretting more uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_How to grow it_\r\n\r\n\r\n=Soils and Fertilizers=\r\n\r\nHemp should not be grown on poor soils. To obtain good yields and fiber\r\nof high-quality, it is necessary to have a growth of uniform stalks 6 to\r\n8 feet long. Short stalks, from poor nonfertile soils, seldom produce a\r\nhigh-quality fiber.\r\n\r\nFiber hemp grows successfully on soils of the Clarion, Tama, Carrington,\r\nMaury, Hagerstown, and Miami series, which, in general, are deep,\r\nmedium-heavy loams, well-drained, and high in organic matter.\r\nArtificially drained areas of the Webster, Brookston, and Maumee series\r\nalso give satisfactory yields. These soils are among the most productive\r\nsoils of the Corn Belt. They produce average yields of 50 to 70 bushels\r\nor more of corn per acre. If land will not produce from 50 to 70 bushels\r\nof corn per acre, it should not be planted to hemp for fiber production.\r\n\r\nMuck or peat soils are not recommended for the production of high-quality\r\nhemp fiber. The quantity of fiber produced per acre on these soils may be\r\nvery high, but experience has demonstrated that the fiber lacks strength,\r\nwhich is the first requirement of hemp fiber for good cordage.\r\n\r\nThe inexperienced farmer usually gets advice from an experienced\r\nhemp-mill superintendent in the selection of the right soil. In fact, the\r\nfarmer's contract to grow hemp usually specifies the exact field that it\r\nhas been mutually agreed should be used for the hemp crop. This type of\r\nsupervision by the company contracting for hemp has helped to prevent\r\nmany crop failures.\r\n\r\nHemp should not be grown continuously on the same soil, for the same\r\nreasons that many other crops are not adapted to such practices. In\r\nWisconsin, fields previously used for a cultivated crop are selected\r\nfor hemp planting in preference to ones upon which small grains have\r\nbeen grown. In Kentucky, bluegrass sod, if obtainable, is selected. Old\r\npastures plowed up are well suited for hemp culture. Fields previously\r\ncropped to soybeans, alfalfa, and clover are excellent for hemp. A good\r\nrotation is to follow corn with hemp, and in Kentucky a fall cereal may\r\nfollow the hemp.\r\n\r\nAlthough hemp requires a rich soil, it does not remove from the farm an\r\nexcess of plant-food material. Nearly all the leaves on the hemp plants,\r\ncontaining much of the plant nutrients removed from the soil, fall\r\noff during the growth and maturing of the plant. The remaining leaves\r\nmay drop off in the field during the process of retting. Further, the\r\nplant stems lose about 20 percent in weight of soluble and decomposed\r\nmaterials, which leach out upon the fields, and the stubble may be plowed\r\nunder. The plant in this manner returns to the land a large part of the\r\nplant nutrients that it removes during its growth.\r\n\r\nCommercial fertilizers may be used to advantage on soils that are not\r\nwell supplied with organic matter. Ordinarily, the best fertilizer\r\nfor hemp is barnyard manure, but commercial fertilizer can be used to\r\nadvantage to supplement manure. Lime applications may be supplied on acid\r\nsoils to advantage. Consult your county agent for recommendations as to\r\namounts of fertilizer and lime to apply.\r\n\r\n=Seed=\r\n\r\nThe period of flowering of the hemp plant may extend over several weeks,\r\nand as a result the seed does not all mature at one time. Hemp seed\r\nfor sowing frequently contains some immature green to yellowish-green\r\nseeds that may not germinate well. Good hempseed for sowing should be\r\nrelatively free of such seeds and should germinate 90 percent or better.\r\nAs the oil content of hempseed usually ranges between 29 and 34 percent,\r\nthe seed should be kept cool and dry, as it spoils rapidly under warm\r\nand damp conditions. Hemp seed seldom retains its germinating power well\r\nenough to be used for seed after 2-years' storage.\r\n\r\n=When to Plant=\r\n\r\nHemp should be planted in the spring just before corn. In a program\r\ncalling for small spring grains and corn, the farmer should plan to plant\r\nhis hemp between the time he plants his small grains and the corn.\r\n\r\n=Seeding=\r\n\r\nHemp grown for seed production should be sown in rows or hills. The hills\r\nare commonly spaced 5 by 5 feet, with 6 to 10 seeds to the hill, planted\r\nnot more than 1/2 inch deep. The plants are thinned to 3 to 5 to a hill.\r\nIf care is taken to save seed, about 1-1/2 pounds wall sow an acre. Most\r\nfarmers use more seed, and frequently the crop is replanted because of\r\nlate floods or failure to obtain good stands.\r\n\r\nHemp grown for fiber should be sown with a broadcast seeder or with a\r\ngrain drill. A drill with 4 inches between drill tubes is preferred to\r\none with 6 inches or more. The seed should not be planted deeper than 1\r\ninch, and a depth of 1/2 inch is preferred. If the seed is planted deep,\r\nthe hemp seedling is not capable of pushing its way to the surface of the\r\nground. A slight crust on the ground frequently results in a poor stand.\r\nIf the seedbed is loose, disks on a seed drill may cut too deep into the\r\nsoil and the seed will be sown more than 1 inch deep. In such cases, to\r\nmake certain that the disks do not cut too deep into the seedbed, they\r\nshould be tied to the seed box.\r\n\r\nA standard bushel of hempseed weighs 44 pounds. The rate of seeding hemp\r\nfor fiber production ranges between 3 and 5 pecks of seed per acre. In\r\nKentucky, where hemp is hand-broken, it has been the practice to sow 3\r\npecks (33 pounds) per acre. However, when the hemp is to go to the mill,\r\n1 bushel per acre gives a product that is better suited to milling.\r\nWisconsin and other Corn Belt farmers have commonly sown 5 pecks per\r\nacre. The lighter rate of seeding in Kentucky produces larger stalks.\r\nThese stalks are easily broken, and the fiber is easily prepared by the\r\nhand-breaking methods that have been used there since colonial days.\r\nMachine methods of breaking and scutching to prepare the fiber are used\r\nin Wisconsin, and recently to some extent in Kentucky. The machines will\r\nhandle finer stems, and the sowing of 5 pecks is advisable where hemp is\r\nto be prepared by machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA good practice in planting hemp for fiber production is to sow around\r\nthe edge of the field next to the fence a 16- to 18-foot width of small\r\ngrains, which may be harvested before the hemp. Space is thus provided\r\nfor the harvester to enter the field and begin cutting without injuring\r\nthe hemp. It also prevents hemp plants at the edge from growing too rank.\r\nUniform plants are necessary for uniform fiber quality.\r\n\r\n=Culture=\r\n\r\nFall plowing in Wisconsin gives better results with hemp than spring\r\nplowing.\r\n\r\nHemp for fiber production requires little or no cultivation or care\r\nafter planting until the harvest; but if, after seeding and before the\r\nseedlings emerge, the ground crusts badly it may be advisable to roll the\r\nfield to break the crust. Hemp for seed production should be cultivated\r\nthe same as corn; that is, sufficiently to keep back the weeds. Spudding\r\nout Canada thistles where they appear in dense stands in hemp fields\r\nshould be done when the hemp is only a few inches high. In most cases\r\nhemp will compete well with weeds, if the hemp gets off to a good start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties to grow_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fiber hemp grown in the United States by the early colonists was of\r\nEuropean origin; but our present hemp, commonly known as Kentucky or\r\ndomestic hemp, is of Chinese origin. Few importations of hempseed have\r\nbeen made in recent years for commercial plantings, as imported seed has\r\nnot proved as productive under domestic conditions as Kentucky hemp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enemies_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States there are no hemp diseases of economic importance,\r\nand hemp has not been seriously attacked by insects. The European corn\r\nborer and similar stem-boring insects occasionally kill a hemp stem.\r\nHowever, they have not proved important, perhaps because hemp has not\r\nbeen grown to any extent in the sections of the United States where the\r\nEuropean corn borer is a serious pest. Seedling plants are frequently\r\nattacked by cutworms and white grubs after spring plowing of sod land.\r\n\r\nBroom rape is a small weed 6 to 15 inches high that is parasitic on the\r\nroots of hemp, tobacco, and tomatoes, it usually grows in clumps and has\r\npurple flowers, which produce many very small seeds. These adhere to the\r\nwaxy flower parts surrounding the hempseed and are distributed in this\r\nmanner. Broom rape can be very serious on hemp if proper control measures\r\nare not followed. Only well-cleaned hempseed and seed from fields\r\ncontaining no broom rape should be sown.\r\n\r\nHemp has been recommended as a weed-control crop. Its dense, tall\r\ngrowth helps to kill out many common weeds. The noxious bindweed, a\r\nmember of the morning-glory family, is checked to some extent by hemp.\r\nUnfortunately, bindweed and several other species of morning-glory\r\nhave seeds so near the same size and weight of hempseed that mixtures\r\nobtained in producing hempseed are carried to the field planted for fiber\r\nproduction. In growing hemp for seed all vine weeds of this type found on\r\nthe hemp stalks should be removed before the hemp plants begin to produce\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting_\r\n\r\n\r\n=Time to Harvest=\r\n\r\nHemp is harvested for seed production when the plant on being shaken\r\nsheds most of its seed. This occurs when the seeds are fully mature on\r\nthe middle branches. The seeds will mature on the lower branches first\r\nand on the top of the plant last. The common method of harvesting hemp\r\nfor seed production is to cut it by hand and shock it to permit more seed\r\nto mature and cure before threshing. The harvesting should be in the\r\nearly morning or on damp days when the seeds do not shatter so much as\r\nthey do in the warmer and drier part of the day. Threshing of the seed\r\nhemp should be done on dry afternoons. In threshing, the seed shocks\r\nshould be placed on large canvas cloths 24 by 24 feet and then be beaten\r\nwith long sticks to remove the seed.\r\n\r\nHemp is harvested for fiber production when the male plants are in full\r\nflower and are shedding pollen. By harvesting before the male plants die,\r\nthe retting of both male and female plants is more uniform, as both types\r\nof plants are still green and growing. The harvesting period may extend\r\nfor 2 weeks or longer. Very early harvested hemp may produce a finer and\r\nsofter fiber than that harvested later, but it is usually weaker. The\r\nfiber from hemp that has been harvested so late that many seeds have\r\nmatured does not possess so good cordage and textile characteristics\r\nas fiber from hemp harvested earlier. Hemp stalks should be relatively\r\nfree of leaves except a few at the very top before harvesting. This is\r\nimportant when hemp is shocked after harvest, as it makes the top of the\r\nshock smaller so that less rain can enter the shock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=Machinery=\r\n\r\nHarvesting methods vary with locality and climate. In Kentucky, hemp may\r\ngrow to a height of 15 feet or more. These long stalks are difficult to\r\nhandle with machinery. Self-rake reapers (see below) have been used in\r\nharvesting hemp for many years, and they probably do better work with\r\nvery tall hemp than any other machine now available. A modified rice\r\nbinder, which cuts and binds the hemp into bundles, is also available,\r\nalthough difficulty in handling the very tall hemp may be experienced.\r\nThis latter type of machine can be used for short hemp in areas, such as\r\nKentucky, where hemp must be shocked within a few days after harvest to\r\navoid sunburn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the Corn Belt the hemp usually does not grow so\r\ntall and therefore can be handled more easily with machines. During the\r\nfirst World War hemp-harvesting machinery was developed. These harvesters\r\n(see above) in one operation cut an 8- or 9-foot swath and elevate the\r\nstalks to a quarter-circle platform where they are turned automatically\r\nand dropped or spread on the ground for retting. The butts of the stems\r\nall lie in the same direction and are relatively even. The thickness of\r\nthe layer of stalks in the swath influences the speed and uniformity of\r\nthe dew retting. Machines of this type, because of their labor economy,\r\nare recommended for use in the Northern States, where hemp can be safely\r\nspread for retting when harvested.\r\n\r\nHemp harvesters are usually owned by the hemp mills. They are rented to\r\nthe individual farmers, who usually furnish the motive power and the\r\nlabor to run the harvesters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Retting_\r\n\r\n\r\nRetting is the partial rotting of the hemp stalk. It permits the fiber\r\nin the stalk to separate easily in long strands from the woody core. The\r\nfiber strands break if unretted stems are bent or broken.\r\n\r\nIn this country the usual practice is to ret hemp by allowing it to lie\r\non the ground, where it is exposed to rain and dew. This method is called\r\ndew retting.\r\n\r\nDew retting is dependent upon dews and rains to furnish the moist\r\nconditions necessary for the growth of the molds that cause the retting.\r\nIn warm, moist weather the retting may require 1 to 2 weeks, but usually\r\n4 to 5 weeks is required for retting in Kentucky and Wisconsin. Hemp has\r\nremained spread under snow in Wisconsin until spring without serious\r\ninjury, but more often hemp left under snow all winter is overretted and\r\nruined.\r\n\r\n=Underretting and Overretting=\r\n\r\nIf hemp stalks are lifted from the ground before they are sufficiently\r\nretted, the fiber will not separate easily from the woody hurds (small\r\npieces of the woody core of the plant) in milling. However, if the\r\nretting is permitted to go too far, the fiber separates very readily\r\nfrom the core, but the adhesive substance between the individual fiber\r\ncells in the long strand breaks down and the fiber is weak. Hemp further\r\noverretted produces mostly short broken strands of fiber called tow\r\nfiber, which is less valuable than the long parallel strands of fiber\r\ncalled line fiber.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the growing or processing of hemp is good judgment more needed\r\nthan in determining the time to end the ret. Experience and good judgment\r\nare necessary to determine just when the hemp stalks should be lifted\r\nfrom the field and bundled. The lifting and shocking stops the retting\r\naction. The value of the fiber can be cut in half or entirely lost by\r\nseveral days' overretting in warm weather.\r\n\r\n=Sunburning=\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky, hemp spread immediately to ret after harvest is apt to\r\nsunburn, or sunscald. It is common belief that the hot, bright days in\r\nAugust and September in some way cause deterioration of the fiber if\r\nspread for retting. Sunburned fiber is uneven in color, usually has\r\nless strength, and possibly is drier and more harsh than fiber not\r\nsunburned. In order to avoid sunscalding, the hemp is shocked after being\r\nharvested and not spread for retting until the cooler days of November.\r\nIn locations having climatic conditions similar to those prevailing in\r\nWisconsin, sunscald of hemp is rare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=Turning Stalks=\r\n\r\nIn dew retting the spread stalks should be turned once or more during the\r\nretting period. This aids in bleaching the stalks and results in fiber\r\nof more uniform color and quality. The turning is done by workmen using\r\nbent poles approximately 8 to 10 feet in length. The poles are pushed\r\nunder the head ends of stalks in the swath, and the stalks are turned\r\nover without moving the butt ends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn turning the straw the workmen start in the middle of the field,\r\nturning the first swath into vacant center space. The second swath will\r\nbe turned to lie where the first swath had been, and so on.\r\n\r\nCare should be exercised in turning to prevent the stalks from tangling.\r\nThe more hemp is handled, the more tangled the stalks may become. Tangled\r\nhemp is more difficult to process and produces a high proportion of\r\ntangled, short, tow fiber.\r\n\r\n=Testing the End Point of the Ret=\r\n\r\nA few days too long in the field may make the difference between retting\r\nand rotting. Therefore, it is most important that inexperienced farmers\r\nobtain the assistance of the hemp-mill superintendent or an experienced\r\ngrower in determining when to stop the retting.\r\n\r\nDry hemp stalks should be tested when possible to determine the degree of\r\nretting. Three to six stalks are taken in both hands and bent back and\r\nforth to perform the break test. If properly retted, the fiber should not\r\nbreak when the woody core breaks. The hurds should fall free of the fiber\r\nin the breaking and shaking between one's hands. If the hemp is only\r\npartly retted, some hurds will adhere to the loosened fiber. Unretted\r\nhemp fiber is usually green or light yellow. Dew-retted hemp is usually\r\nslate gray or black.\r\n\r\nAfter the fiber is broken free, its strength should be tested by\r\nbreaking a small strand between the fingers. A small strand of fiber\r\nnot twisted and about 3/32 inch wide should break with great difficulty\r\nand with a decided snap. If it is very weak and breaks with little or no\r\nsnap the hemp is probably badly overretted or may have been grown under\r\nunfavorable cultural conditions. (See p. 5.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAll indication that the retting end point is near is that the hemp makes\r\n\"bowstrings.\" In a small percentage of the stems, less than 1 to 5\r\npercent under certain conditions, the middle of the stalks appears to ret\r\nfirst. The fiber comes free from the middle and forms a string fastened\r\nat the top and bottom of the stem, not unlike a bowstring. If bowstring\r\nstems are found, a sample of the hemp should be taken to the hemp-mill\r\nsuperintendent as soon as possible for verification of the retting end\r\npoint. The bowstring condition is only a supplementary aid in determining\r\nwhen to stop the retting, and it may or may not occur in properly\r\ndew-retted hemp.\r\n\r\nSome experienced hemp producers use the peeling test for determining the\r\ndegree of retting. This is accomplished by peeling the fiber away from\r\nthe butt ends of the stems. If properly retted, the fiber should peel\r\nfreely from the woody core of the stem. If the hemp is not sufficiently\r\nretted, the fiber will break after a few inches have been peeled. This\r\nfree-peeling stage is desirable for breaking hemp on hand breaks. Where\r\nhemp is to be processed by machinery the retting need not progress quite\r\nso far as is necessary for hand breaking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Picking Up the Retted Stalks_\r\n\r\n\r\nHemp stalks may be picked up by hand. This method has been used from\r\nearly times and is satisfactory where labor is plentiful. However, in\r\nthis country it is being replaced by machine pick-up binders.\r\n\r\nIn picking up the straw by hand, small sticks about 3 feet long with a\r\nsingle steel or wooden hook on the end are used. The hemp is raked into\r\nbunches with these implements, and usually tied. Hemp-fiber bands are\r\nused in tying the bundles. An inexpensive \"buck\" (see above) may be used\r\nto bunch the hemp, or it may be bunched with a pitchfork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe most efficient method is to use the pick-up binder. These machines,\r\ndrawn by tractors, cover about an acre an hour. They pick up the retted\r\nhemp stalks and tie them into bundles in one operation. The machines are\r\npart of the modern hemp-mill equipment and are rented to farmers.\r\n\r\nDew-retted hemp is usually shocked after being picked up. The hemp\r\nremains in the shock until it is transported to the mill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extra Care Insures Extra Profits_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farmer's job is done when he delivers the hemp to the mill. All\r\nfurther processing to prepare the fiber is part of the milling operation.\r\nHowever, it is of interest to both farmers and mill operators to attempt\r\nto keep the hemp stalks and fiber well butted. This means keeping the\r\nbutt ends of the stalks or fiber in a bundle all even. Every time the\r\nhemp stalks are handled, care should be taken to see that this is done.\r\nIf the hemp stalks are well butted in the bundle when processed, the\r\nmilling operations can be carried out more economically. Tangled, uneven\r\nbundles are more difficult and require more time to handle. The yield of\r\nhigh-value long-life fiber is much greater if the stalks are well butted.\r\n\r\nHemp stalks are considered most desirable if they are less than half\r\nan inch in diameter. The thickness of a pencil is frequently used to\r\nillustrate the size of desirable stalks. The larger diameter stalks have\r\na lower percentage of fiber than finer stems, are harder to break, and\r\nproduce more tow fiber.\r\n\r\nHemp stalks grown on unproductive soil usually contain a lower percentage\r\nof fiber, and this fiber may be coarse, harsh, and of low strength, so\r\nthat it breaks into tow in milling.\r\n\r\nStalks underretted frequently must be run through the mill breaker a\r\nsecond or third time to remove the remaining hurds. This increases the\r\nmilling labor costs, and the resultant fiber may be reduced to a low\r\ngrade. On the other hand, overretted hemp must be milled as little as\r\npossible, with less pressure exerted on the rollers and a slower speed of\r\nthe scutcher wheel to keep from making an excess amount of tow fiber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yields_\r\n\r\n\r\nHemp yields have been extremely variable when this crop has been planted\r\nin new areas by inexperienced farmers. In Wisconsin and Kentucky, where\r\nonly experienced farmers have grown the crop in recent years, the yields\r\nhave not varied a great deal. The crop has been reasonably dependable and\r\nhas not often been injured by storms or droughts.\r\n\r\nThe average yields per acre for experienced farmers are approximately\r\n2-1/4 to 2-1/2 tons of air-dry retted hemp stalks; 850 pounds total\r\nfiber. Under the Wisconsin machine-milling system the yields may average\r\n450 pounds line fiber and 400 pounds tow fiber; under the Kentucky\r\nhand-breaking system they may average 775 pounds Kentucky rough and 75\r\npounds tow.\r\n\r\nIf hemp is planted for seed production, the average yields per acre are\r\napproximately 15 bushels or 660 pounds, on bottom land, and 12 bushels on\r\nuplands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.
