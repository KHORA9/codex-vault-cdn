Now he stood as though turned to\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nFar overhead the sun beat down fiercely from a brazen sky, though its\r\nrays were caught and held by the heavy foliage, so that beneath the\r\nbranches of the trees semi-darkness prevailed. But if the brightness\r\nof the sun was thus excluded, its heat made itself felt, and masses\r\nof steaming vapor rose from the lush vegetation drenched by recent\r\nrains.\r\n\r\nFrom a distance came the screams of parrots and the howling of\r\nmonkeys, but otherwise the jungle was silent.\r\n\r\nIt had not been silent a moment before. From a point toward which\r\nBomba was facing had come a sound that was new to the jungle and\r\nalmost new to Bomba—a sound he had heard but twice. And each of those\r\ntimes was indelibly graven on his memory.\r\n\r\nOnce had been when Casson had brought down the savage jaguar with\r\nthe iron stick or “rifle,” as Casson had called it. The beast had\r\nbeen crouching on the limb of a tree beneath which Bomba had sat\r\ndown to rest. He had not seen the creature, whose huge body had been\r\nflattened close against the bough.\r\n\r\nHe had had no intimation of danger until he had seen the startled\r\nlook in the eyes of Casson and heard his shout of warning. Then he\r\nhad leaped to his feet. At the same instant the jaguar sprang. But\r\nCasson drew the iron stick to his shoulder, and a flame leaped from\r\nthe end of it, accompanied by a sharp report.\r\n\r\nThe beast whirled about in mid-air and fell to the ground, one of its\r\noutstretched claws grazing Bomba’s leg as the latter sprang aside.\r\nThe jaguar writhed and twisted about for a moment and then lay still.\r\n\r\nWhen Bomba was sure the creature was dead, he had approached and\r\nexamined it curiously. He had seen the natives kill game with arrows,\r\nand he half expected to see some missile protruding from the body.\r\nBut there was no sign of this—only a tiny hole through the center of\r\nits forehead, from which blood was oozing.\r\n\r\nHe had questioned Casson curiously, but the latter was in one of his\r\nsilent moods that day and gave no explanation. But the convulsive way\r\nin which he had strained Bomba to his breast told how deeply he had\r\nbeen stirred by the narrow escape.\r\n\r\nThe other time and the last that Bomba had witnessed the work of\r\nthe iron stick had been when a giant anaconda had reared its horrid\r\nhead in front of Bomba and darted forward to enclose him in its\r\nfolds. Again Casson had fired, but this time instead of a loud crack\r\nthere had been a thunderous roar, and the stick had exploded into a\r\nthousand fragments. Casson had fallen over on his back. The great\r\nsnake, frightened by the noise and struck by some of the flying bits\r\nof iron, had hastily retreated. Bomba, who had escaped with some\r\nscratches, had managed to get the unconscious Casson back to the hut\r\nin which they dwelt, and there the old man had lain for many days,\r\nnursed by Bomba and treated with some of the simple remedies he had\r\nlearned from the natives.\r\n\r\nCasson had finally recovered, but had never again been the same. His\r\nhead had been injured by the explosion, and his memory, which had\r\nbeen failing for some time, now almost wholly disappeared. At times\r\nhe had flashes of recollection of his old life, but these were few\r\nand transient. Most of the time he was wrapped in moody silence, and\r\nBomba felt more alone than ever.\r\n\r\nBut this had happened years ago, and the sound of the iron stick had\r\nalmost passed from Bomba’s memory. Now he heard it again, and his\r\npulses leaped.\r\n\r\nIt came from a distance perhaps half a mile away. Who had fired\r\nthe stick? He knew that none of the natives had any weapon of the\r\nkind. Could it be some man like Casson, a man with a white skin like\r\nCasson’s and his own?\r\n\r\nA white skin! Something tugged at Bomba’s heart. He could not have\r\ntold what it was. It might have been memory, intuition, instinct. But\r\nwhatever it was, it took instant and entire possession of him.\r\n\r\nHe must find out who had fired the iron stick!\r\n\r\nThe primal law of the jungle is to mind one’s own business. Intrusion\r\non the affairs of another is never welcomed and usually resented.\r\nBomba had learned to obey that law.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily he would have given a wide berth to the locality from\r\nwhich the sound had come, swerved aside, and plunged deeper into the\r\njungle. Where the iron stick sounded there was probably danger. It\r\nwas associated in his mind with deadly beasts and reptiles. There\r\nwas trouble enough in the jungle without looking for it.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, did he depart from all his usual caution and begin making\r\nhis way toward the spot from which the sound had come?\r\n\r\nHe did not know. A confused tumult of thoughts and longings swept\r\nthrough his brain. He was conscious of a desperate urge that impelled\r\nhim in that direction; and that urge came from the profoundest depths\r\nof his soul.\r\n\r\nA white man must have fired that iron stick. The stick itself had\r\nsome appeal to his curiosity. He would like to see it again—that\r\nmysterious thing that killed like magic from a distance.\r\n\r\nBut that desire was not compelling. Had he thought a native had\r\nfired it, he would not have risked intruding on what might be a\r\nhostile hunting party, possibly some of the dreaded head-hunters that\r\noccasionally invaded this region.\r\n\r\nNo, it was the craving to see a man with a white skin like his own,\r\nlike Casson’s, that drew him on, drew him with a power he could no\r\nmore resist than a chip could stem the current of Niagara.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the white man might prove hostile. The deadly fire stick\r\nmight be turned on himself. But he did not believe this. Casson had\r\nalways been kind to him. All white men would be. Were they not his\r\nown kind? Was he not their brother? A wild surge of yearning swept\r\nover him.\r\n\r\nAll the longings he had felt so often, that came to him with\r\nincreasing intensity day and night, that he had never been able to\r\nanalyze and understand came to a head at the report of the iron\r\nstick. He could not resist them. He did not want to resist them.\r\n\r\nHe must see the man with the white skin!\r\n\r\nBomba was a striking figure as he worked his way through the jungle\r\nover sprawling roots and through a network of vines, gradually\r\ndrawing closer to the spot from which the sound had come.\r\n\r\nHe was nothing more than a boy, fourteen years at most, of a little\r\nabove the ordinary height at that age, compact and muscular. He had\r\nbrown eyes and brown wavy hair and the whitest of teeth. His skin was\r\ndarkly tanned by exposure to the sun.\r\n\r\nOn his feet were rude home-made sandals, and around his body was\r\nwrapped a bit of native cloth and a small puma-skin—the skin of\r\nGeluk, the puma, who had tried to eat the friendly parrots, Kiki and\r\nWoowoo. Bomba had caught him in the attempt and killed him with an\r\narrow.\r\n\r\nThe skin heightened the resemblance of Bomba to a young panther as,\r\nlight and supple, the muscles of arms and legs rippling under the\r\nbronzed skin, he threaded his way deftly through the underbrush.\r\n\r\nBomba lived with an old naturalist, Cody Casson, in the depths of\r\nthe Amazonian jungle, so remote from civilization that it was rarely\r\nif ever visited by white men. Of his past he knew nothing, and so\r\nfar Casson had told him next to nothing. He had given the boy some\r\nrudiments of education, especially in his own line of botany and\r\nnatural history, but even this teaching had ceased years before when\r\nthe old naturalist’s mind had been weakened by the exploding rifle.\r\n\r\nBomba knew nothing of the world at large, nothing of the white race\r\nto which he belonged, little even of the life of the natives of the\r\nregion. For the pair did not mingle much with the latter and were\r\nthemselves shunned by the superstitious natives, who had got the idea\r\nfrom the old naturalist’s queer actions that he was a Man of Evil.\r\n\r\nTwo eyes of which he was not aware were watching Bomba as he\r\napproached a narrow part of the rude native trail he was following,\r\nwicked eyes, malignant eyes glowing with lurid fires.\r\n\r\nThe eyes were set in the swaying head of a cooanaradi, the most\r\nterrible serpent on earth.\r\n\r\nIt lay in its lair just beside the path that Bomba was following, its\r\nbody, fourteen feet in length, thrown into coils, above which the\r\nslender head swayed back and forth. Evilly beautiful, it glowed with\r\nall the colors of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nHad it been a rattlesnake or any other poisonous denizen of the\r\njungle, it would have glided away into the bushes, glad enough to\r\navoid an encounter with human enemies unless attacked. Even the boa\r\nor the anaconda is apathetic and, except when moved by hunger, seldom\r\ntakes the initiative.\r\n\r\nBut what makes the cooanaradi so dreaded, apart from its deadly\r\npoison, is its ferocity. It does not avoid attack; it seeks to make\r\nit. Nor is it satisfied when its enemy flees; it follows in pursuit.\r\n\r\nBut there was no need yet for that. All unsuspecting, its prey was\r\ncoming toward it. Soon he would be in reach of the lightning stroke.\r\nThe evil eyes gloated in anticipation.\r\n\r\nThen, when Bomba was barely ten feet away, he saw it!\r\n\r\nThere was no time to string his arrow. There was no time to draw his\r\nmachete. Even while he looked, the snake launched its spring.\r\n\r\nLike a flash Bomba turned and ran for his life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MEN WITH THE IRON STICK\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment that Bomba made his first startled leap he heard close\r\nbehind him the thud of a body as it struck the earth. The reptile had\r\nmissed its spring.\r\n\r\nBut this brought Bomba small comfort. He knew that the fight had just\r\nbegun, that behind him death was coming and traveling fast.\r\n\r\nOne look was all he cast behind him, but that was sufficient to show\r\nthe slithering long body of his implacable foe moving swiftly along\r\nthe trail.\r\n\r\nBomba was agile and fleet of foot, and he tore along at an astounding\r\nrate of speed. But he knew too much of his adversary to believe that\r\nhe could distance it. In the long run, the endurance of the snake\r\nwould outlast that of the fugitive.\r\n\r\nBut if Bomba’s feet were fast, so was his brain, and it was working\r\nnow with lightning rapidity. It was recalling every turn and oddity\r\nof the trail along which he was speeding.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of trees, but before he could get a grip and begin\r\nto climb, the fearful thing would be upon him. And even if he had\r\nsufficient start to avoid the first stroke, the snake could climb\r\nmuch more rapidly than Bomba could dream of doing.\r\n\r\nHad there been a stream at hand, he would have plunged into it,\r\nalthough he might have become the prey of some lurking cayman or been\r\ntorn to bits by the fierce piranhas. Either of those fates would have\r\nbeen a possibility. But he would at least have had a chance of not\r\nbeing attacked, while, unless he could escape from the cooanaradi,\r\ndeath was a certainty.\r\n\r\nAt times, when he came to a little opening, he would dart off to\r\nthe right or the left, so as to disconcert the enemy. This had the\r\ndesired effect more than once, and enabled him to get some space\r\nahead before the snake was again at full speed on his trail.\r\n\r\nBomba’s breath was fast failing him, but his courage and mental\r\nalertness still remained. Then he caught sight of something that gave\r\nhim a gleam of hope.\r\n\r\nIt was a thick, matted mass of whiplike streamers hanging from one\r\nof the trees. It spread out like a huge fan with narrow interstices\r\nbetween the tough withes. Behind this screen he darted like a flash\r\nand stood there panting, facing the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe cooanaradi was not twenty feet away, coming at tremendous speed,\r\nits eyes red with fury. As it approached, Bomba thrust his face\r\nagainst the screen and shouted.\r\n\r\nWhat he had hoped came to pass. The snake, infuriated at the\r\nchallenge, reared and struck at the face of his foe. Bomba dodged,\r\nand the opened jaws of the snake caught and in turn were held by the\r\nmatted mass into which the fangs had sunk.\r\n\r\nIt writhed wildly and tried to extricate itself. But in an instant\r\nBomba had leaped to the other side of the screen. His hands worked\r\nlike lightning, deftly winding the withes like cords around the\r\ntwisting body, until it was securely enmeshed in a net from which\r\nthere was no escape.\r\n\r\nOnly when he had made sure of his victory did Bomba desist and stand\r\npanting a little distance off, watching the unavailing efforts of the\r\ncaptive to free itself.\r\n\r\nCraft and cunning had triumphed over the fiend of the jungle. The boy\r\nhad had a narrow escape from one of the most terrible of deaths, and\r\nhe owed it solely to his own speedy feet and active brain.\r\n\r\nHe was drenched with perspiration from head to foot. His lungs were\r\nstrained almost to bursting. His breath came in great gasping sobs.\r\nBut he had won, and every nerve tingled with exultation.\r\n\r\nHis hand slid to the handle of his machete, a formidable double-edged\r\nknife ground to almost a razor’s sharpness and fully a foot in length.\r\n\r\nBut after a moment’s reflection he slipped the partly drawn weapon\r\nback in his belt. A slash at the snake might sever some of the withes\r\nwith which it was bound, only wound the reptile and permit it to get\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nNo, the jungle itself could be trusted to finish the work begun by\r\nthe boy. The peccaries, or wild pigs, would happen along, and to them\r\na snake was the daintiest of foods.\r\n\r\nOr there were the vultures. Bomba cast his eyes upward through\r\nan opening in the trees and saw one of these rapacious creatures\r\ncircling about and slowly descending, already attracted by that\r\nalmost miraculous instinct that tells the carrion eaters where death\r\nhas come or is imminent.\r\n\r\nAnd even the vulture would have to come soon, or a swarm of ants\r\nwould be going over the reptile stripping the flesh from the bones.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of the flight and pursuit, Bomba had forgotten for\r\nthe moment the object of his quest. Now it came back to him with the\r\nforce of a shock.\r\n\r\nThe white man with the iron stick! Could he find him now? Or was he\r\ntoo late?\r\n\r\nHe cast one glance at his captive to make sure that it was securely\r\nheld. Then having satisfied himself on this point, hurriedly resumed\r\nhis journey.\r\n\r\nBut he did not follow the same path on which he had found the\r\ncooanaradi. He knew that these reptiles usually traveled in pairs,\r\nand he had no desire to encounter the mate of the one that had so\r\nnearly proved his doom.\r\n\r\nSo he made a wide detour, although he bitterly resented the necessity\r\nof doing so, for now a fear that was almost panic assailed him that\r\nhe might miss meeting the man with the iron stick. It was already\r\nlate in the afternoon, and unless he came upon him before darkness\r\nset in, he would probably fail altogether in finding him. And this\r\npossibility had by this time assumed the proportions of a calamity.\r\n\r\nWhy he should lay such stress on this was more than Bomba could\r\nexplain, even to himself. But the fact was there. He must find this\r\nman!\r\n\r\nThere was no trail in the direction he had been forced to choose, and\r\noften he had to hack his way through the underbrush with his machete.\r\nIt was laborious and exhausting work, and it was nearly an hour\r\nbefore he caught a scent of roasting meat that told him he was in the\r\nvicinity of some human inhabitant of the wilds.\r\n\r\nNow he worked with extreme caution, for he was by no means sure of\r\nhis reception, and he wanted, from the safe seclusion of the jungle,\r\nto form his own ideas of conditions before venturing into the open.\r\n\r\nA few minutes more of stealthy approach, and he heard the sound of\r\nvoices. Some of these he recognized at once as those of natives.\r\n\r\nBut there were other tongues too, and with a thrill he realized that\r\nthey were speaking the same language that he and Casson used and that\r\nhe had never yet heard from other lips! Some of the words he could\r\nnot understand, but the simpler ones were familiar.\r\n\r\nHe tingled with delight. He was not then too late. The white man was\r\nthere. He could look upon him, devour him with his avid eyes, perhaps\r\nspeak with him!\r\n\r\nA moment later he reached the fringe of the heavier jungle. Beyond,\r\nit widened out into a glade of considerable extent.\r\n\r\nHe dropped on his knees and wormed his way to a great tree near\r\nthe edge. Then, lying flat on the ground, he carefully parted the\r\nunderbrush and peered through.\r\n\r\nHe saw at once that he had come upon a considerable party. A rude\r\ntent had been pitched in the center of the glade, a number of packs\r\nlittered the ground, and a dozen natives were engaged at various\r\ntasks. A fire had been built, and some freshly cut steaks of meat,\r\nstuck on spits, were being roasted by native cooks.\r\n\r\nBomba gave these but a cursory glance. His eyes were riveted on two\r\nmen, one tall and gaunt, the other stocky and muscular, who sat on\r\nadjoining stumps conversing with each other. One was cleaning and\r\noiling an iron stick. The other was skinning the body of an animal\r\nthe size of a calf that Bomba recognized from its coarse hair and\r\nblackish brown hide as that of a tapir, whose life had evidently been\r\ntaken by the shot that Bomba had heard.\r\n\r\nThe faces of the men were bronzed, but their shirts were open at the\r\nthroat, and Bomba could see the white skin like his own and Casson’s.\r\n\r\nAgain that strange thrill shot through him and he had all he could do\r\nto repress a shout of delight.\r\n\r\nHe scanned their faces closely. They were keen faces, alight with\r\nintelligence. How different, Bomba thought, from the vacuous faces of\r\nthe natives who surrounded them. To him they seemed like visitants\r\nfrom another sphere.\r\n\r\nAnd they were kindly faces. The men were laughing and joking with\r\neach other, evidently in the best of spirits. There was nothing there\r\nthat need arouse fear in any but evil-doers. His heart warmed with a\r\nsense of kinship.\r\n\r\nImpulsively he rose to go out into the clearing. Then he sank down\r\nagain. Shyness, reticence, caution, the restraint bred of the\r\njungle! He longed to show himself, yet he shrank back.\r\n\r\nHis problem was solved for him. His sudden movement had caught the\r\nkeen eye of a native. Instantly the fellow shrilled an alarm.\r\n\r\nThe white men snatched their iron sticks and sprang to their feet.\r\n\r\nThe die was cast! Bomba leaped out into the open!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA STEALTHY FOE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn exclamation of surprise came from the white men as Bomba advanced\r\ntoward them with his upraised palms, extended as a sign of amity, and\r\nthey lowered their rifles.\r\n\r\n“Just an Indian kid!” remarked the stockier of the two with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“Indian nothing!” retorted the other, as his keen eyes swept the lad.\r\n“Look at his hair, his eyes, his features. He’s as white as we are,\r\nor my name isn’t Gillis. Look again, Dorn.”\r\n\r\n“Guess you’re right, old man,” conceded Jake Dorn, after a close\r\nscrutiny. “But what in the mischief is he doing here? I didn’t know\r\nthere were any other whites within a thousand miles of us.”\r\n\r\n“Neither did I,” replied Ralph Gillis. “But we were evidently wrong.\r\nProbably he belongs to some other camp of rubber hunters not far\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n“But look at his clothes, if you can call them clothes,” said Dorn,\r\nwith a puzzled air. “I never saw a white boy dressed like that.\r\nNothing but a clout and a puma skin.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll soon solve the mystery,” said Gillis. “Come here, boy,” he\r\nadded kindly.\r\n\r\nBomba came shyly toward him.\r\n\r\n“What is your name?” asked Gillis.\r\n\r\n“Bomba,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Bomba!” repeated Gillis, with a frown of perplexity. “That’s a queer\r\nname for a white boy. For you are white, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Bomba proudly, as he drew aside the puma skin and\r\nexhibited his chest.\r\n\r\n“And since you understand what I say to you, you must be either\r\nAmerican or English,” pursued Gillis. “What is your other name?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t any,” was the reply. “I am Bomba.”\r\n\r\nThe men exchanged puzzled glances.\r\n\r\n“Who are your folks?” put in Dorn.\r\n\r\nBomba pondered for a moment.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what that word means,” he replied simply.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” exclaimed Gillis. “I mean your father, your\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\n“I guess I never had any,” replied Bomba. “I never saw them or heard\r\nof them.”\r\n\r\n“The poor kid!” murmured Dorn.\r\n\r\n“But you must have somebody to live with or take care of you,” said\r\nGillis.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Bomba, “I live with Cody Casson.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he and where is he?” asked Gillis.\r\n\r\n“He is an old man,” answered Bomba. “He lives in a hut a long way\r\noff,” and he pointed toward the south.\r\n\r\n“Is he a relation of yours?” asked Dorn.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what that means,” was the answer.\r\n\r\nGillis threw up his hands in despair.\r\n\r\n“Well, wouldn’t that get your goat?” he ejaculated.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t got any goat,” replied Bomba, who thought the question was\r\naddressed to him.\r\n\r\nThe men laughed heartily, and Bomba, though a little puzzled, laughed\r\nwith them. He was glad that he had said something that pleased them.\r\nThey were nice men. His heart warmed to them.\r\n\r\nGillis returned to the attack.\r\n\r\n“When did you come into this jungle?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I have always been here,” answered Bomba.\r\n\r\n“But don’t you remember ever living anywhere else?” persisted Gillis.\r\n“Don’t you remember coming over the ocean?”\r\n\r\n“What is the ocean?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\n“It is like a river, but a thousand times as big,” explained his\r\nquestioner.\r\n\r\nBomba shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “I never saw any water I could not swim across.”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you ever heard of England or America?” put in Dorn.\r\n\r\n“No,” was the reply. “There are no animals here that have those\r\nnames.”\r\n\r\nA glance of pity passed between the two men.\r\n\r\n“An untutored child of nature, if there ever was one!” exclaimed\r\nGillis. “How in heaven’s name do you explain it?”\r\n\r\n“Search me!” replied Dorn. “Seems to me the only thing to do is to\r\nhunt up this fellow Casson and get it out of him. The boy ought to be\r\ntaken out to civilization and have his chance.”\r\n\r\n“He ought,” assented Gillis. “Though I don’t see how we can do\r\nanything just now, for our road lies in the opposite direction and\r\nwe’re behind our schedule now. We’ve _got_ to get to the coast in\r\ntime to get that steamer. But later on we’ll take the matter up\r\nourselves or have some of the authorities look into it. But those\r\nsteaks are done now, and I’m as hungry as a wolf. This young visitor\r\nof ours shall fill up too, if he cares to stop and eat with us.”\r\n\r\nBomba gladly accepted the invitation, not only because he was hungry\r\nbut because it gave him a chance to stay in the company of the white\r\nmen. He would have liked to stay with them forever. The thought of\r\nparting filled him with dread.\r\n\r\nThey brought knives and forks from their kit and offered one of each\r\nto Bomba. But he did not know their use, had never seen them, and\r\nate his meat by plucking it apart with his teeth and fingers, as was\r\nhis custom, the while he watched with wonder the deft way in which\r\nthe table utensils were used by his new acquaintances.\r\n\r\nHe felt that it must be a better way than his. The white men did it,\r\nand he himself was white and ought to do it too. Before he was half\r\nway through the meal, he shyly reached out for the knife and fork and\r\ntried to imitate them. The effort was not very successful, but they\r\nsensed his feeling, and be it said to their credit they did not laugh.\r\n\r\nThe meal was interspersed with questionings, in the course of which\r\nthe men learned much and gained marked respect for Bomba’s courage\r\nand self-reliance. They were aghast at his story of the way he had\r\ntrapped the cooanaradi, and would not have believed it had not the\r\nsimple way that Bomba told it carried conviction. He did not boast,\r\nmerely narrated the incident as though it were not of any particular\r\nimportance and simply a part of the day’s work in the jungle.\r\n\r\n“Why not take the boy along with us, if he’s willing?” suggested\r\nGillis, thoughtfully, to his companion. “It would bring him out to\r\ncivilization, and at the same time he’d be a mighty valuable addition\r\nto our party. We’d be killing two birds with one stone.”\r\n\r\n“Right enough,” agreed Dorn. “How would you like to go along with\r\nus?” he asked, addressing himself to Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe boy’s heart leaped and delight shone in his eyes. Oh, how he\r\nwanted to go! But the next moment the light faded and his heart sank.\r\n\r\n“I could not leave Casson,” he said. “He would die if I left him\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n“The boy’s true blue,” said Gillis, “and we mustn’t tempt him. But\r\nsoon or late we’ll see this Casson and perhaps get them both out\r\nof the jungle. The whole thing is the queerest affair I ever came\r\nacross.”\r\n\r\nHe struck a match to light his pipe, and Bomba jumped at the sudden\r\nspurt of flame.\r\n\r\n“Never see one of those before?” asked Dorn, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Bomba. “I make fire like this.”\r\n\r\nHe took a stick and a tiny wooden bowl from his belt, twirled the\r\nstick dexterously, and in a few moments produced a spark.\r\n\r\n“Well done!” cried Dorn admiringly.\r\n\r\nBomba was pleased at the note of approbation, but in his heart he\r\nknew that the white men’s way was quicker and better. He looked\r\nlongingly at the matches, and Gillis, with a smile, handed him a box\r\nof them, which Bomba grasped eagerly and thrust into the small pouch\r\nat his belt. Now he could make fire as the white men did. He felt\r\nthat he was growing closer to them.\r\n\r\nGillis showed him his rifle. It was a far finer iron stick than\r\nCasson’s had been, and Bomba examined it with the greatest curiosity.\r\n\r\nHe did not in the least understand the principle of it, but he knew\r\nits power. The dead tapir was evidence of it, as well as his memory\r\nof the way a similar stick had slain the jaguar.\r\n\r\n“I’ll show you how it works,” volunteered Gillis, noting the boy’s\r\neager interest in the weapon.\r\n\r\nBomba nodded delightedly. This was what he had been wishing for ever\r\nsince he had reached the camp, but had been too shy to ask of his own\r\naccord.\r\n\r\nRalph Gillis took a card and tacked it up against a tree about fifty\r\nfeet away, Bomba watching him intently.\r\n\r\nThen Gillis took up his position and raised the rifle to his\r\nshoulder. Bomba, with a lively recollection of what had happened when\r\nCasson had fired at the anaconda, edged some distance away.\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp crack, and Bomba’s keen eyes noticed a slight\r\nquivering of the card.\r\n\r\n“Come along,” said Gillis, beckoning to the boy, and Bomba followed\r\nhim to the tree, where he saw a small hole in the card that had not\r\nbeen there before. But he looked in vain for any sign of scorching.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t the fire burn it?” he asked.\r\n\r\nGillis looked at him perplexedly, and then laughed as he grasped his\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n“Bless you,” he said, “it wasn’t the fire you saw coming from the\r\nmuzzle that struck the card. It was a cartridge just like this,” and\r\nhe drew one of the pellets from his belt.\r\n\r\nBomba examined it curiously.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t I see this when you fired the iron stick?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“It went too fast for you to see,” explained Gillis patiently.\r\n\r\n“You could see my arrow if I shot it,” said Bomba.\r\n\r\n“That’s different,” said Gillis. “The arrow is bigger, and it doesn’t\r\ngo as fast. And it doesn’t go as straight, either.”\r\n\r\n“It goes straight,” declared Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that you could hit that card?” asked Dorn\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bomba.\r\n\r\n“I’m from Missouri,” remarked Gillis.\r\n\r\n“Where is that?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe men laughed.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said Gillis. “Let’s see you hit the card.”\r\n\r\nBomba drew an arrow from his belt, fitted it to the string, and,\r\nscarcely appearing to take aim, let it go.\r\n\r\nA cry of surprise broke from his new acquaintances as they saw the\r\narrow standing out straight from the center of the card.\r\n\r\n“The boy’s a wonder!” cried Gillis.\r\n\r\n“Robin Hood had nothing on him!” declared Dorn.\r\n\r\n“Who was he?” asked Bomba. “And why did he have nothing on him?” as\r\nhe glanced at the well-clothed forms of the white men.\r\n\r\n“I can see that we’ll have to cut out slang,” laughed Dorn. “Robin\r\nHood was a great shot with the bow and arrow, and what I meant to say\r\nwas that you could shoot as straight as he could.”\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart swelled with pride at the approbation of the white men.\r\nIt seemed to him the sweetest music he had ever heard.\r\n\r\nDusk was drawing on now, and the forest began to waken. From the\r\nlairs in which they had lain during the heat of the day wild beasts\r\nrose, yawned, stretched themselves, and then stalked out on their\r\nnocturnal search for prey. Death was abroad.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times, as Bomba sat by the tent of his new-made friends,\r\nhe raised his head and sniffed the air.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Gillis curiously, after the third repetition.\r\n\r\n“Jaguars,” answered Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe men grasped their rifles and peered into the darkening forest\r\nsurrounding them.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see any,” remarked Gillis, after a moment.\r\n\r\n“They see you,” replied Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe calm matter-of-fact statement sent a little chill down their\r\nspines.\r\n\r\n“How do you know there are any about?” asked Dorn.\r\n\r\n“I smell them,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“On what side of the camp are they?” queried Gillis.\r\n\r\n“All sides,” said Bomba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHOW BOMBA SAVED THE CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men sprang to their feet at this ominous declaration and their\r\neyes swept the forest in every direction.\r\n\r\n“And the boy speaks of this as calmly as though it meant nothing to\r\nhim or us!” exclaimed Jake Dorn.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if he really knows what he is talking about,” cried Gillis.\r\n“Tell me,” he demanded turning to Bomba, “what makes you think there\r\nare jaguars all about us?”\r\n\r\n“I smell them and I hear them,” returned Bomba. “First I heard them\r\na long way off. They were screaming. Then they came nearer, and they\r\nwere snarling. Now they are nearer still, and they are purring. I\r\nhear them.”\r\n\r\n“More than I do, then,” said Gillis, after a few moments, when he and\r\nhis comrade had listened with all their ears. “But I’ve heard some\r\nwonderful stories of the smell and hearing of those who have lived\r\nlong in the jungle, and perhaps the boy is right. If he is, we’ve got\r\na fight on our hands all right. When is this little shindig going\r\nto take place?” he asked Bomba grimly, as his hand tightened on the\r\nstock of his rifle.\r\n\r\n“I do not know shindig,” answered Bomba.\r\n\r\n“When will the jaguars try to kill us?” asked Dorn.\r\n\r\n“Not for a long while,” replied Bomba. “Not till it gets very dark\r\nand many more come.”\r\n\r\n“That’s cheerful,” muttered Gillis.\r\n\r\n“They smell the blood of the tapir,” Bomba went on. “Then they come\r\nand see many men here. Much meat for the jaguars.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll leave out those pleasant little details,” said Dorn,\r\nrepressing a shudder. “It seems likely that we’re in for the fight of\r\nour lives, and you and I will have to do the most of the fighting,\r\nGillis. These natives aren’t good for anything.”\r\n\r\n“I will help,” said Bomba.\r\n\r\n“By ginger, I believe the boy will!” exclaimed Gillis. “He’s as\r\nplucky as a wildcat. Though I’m afraid that bow and arrow won’t do\r\nmuch against such beasts.”\r\n\r\n“I have my machete,” Bomba reminded them, half drawing the gleaming\r\nweapon from its leather sheath.\r\n\r\n“I’m blest if the little rascal isn’t thinking of fighting them hand\r\nto hand!” ejaculated Gillis in admiration.\r\n\r\n“I do not want to, but I will if I have to,” said Bomba. “It is\r\nbetter to kill than be killed. But wait, I think of something.”\r\n\r\nWhile he had been talking, his eyes had been roving among the trees\r\nthat edged the clearing, and they lighted as they fell on a tree with\r\ntriangular pointed leaves.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a pail that was lying near one of the packs.\r\n\r\n“Let me have that,” he said, pointing to it.\r\n\r\n“What do you want of it?” asked Dorn.\r\n\r\n“Don’t bother with questions,” suggested Gillis. “The boy has\r\nsomething in mind, and after what I’ve seen of him I’m willing to\r\ngive him a free hand. Here it is,” handing the pail to him.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Bomba, “make the fire big. The jaguars will go back from\r\nthe light. I have to go into the woods. I do not want them so near.”\r\n\r\nGillis gave a few sharp orders to the natives and they heaped brush\r\non the fire, which had been allowed to die down, and soon it was\r\ncrackling fiercely, sending a broader zone of light through the\r\nsurrounding forest.\r\n\r\nThis made the immediate proximity safe for the time, and Bomba took\r\nthe pail and started out for the tree he had discerned.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t one or both of us better go with you?” asked Dorn\r\nanxiously. “It isn’t right to let you go in there alone.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bomba. “I must do my work myself. You can keep the iron\r\nsticks ready. But you will not need them yet.”\r\n\r\nHe took the pail and went unhesitatingly into the woods. The heavy\r\nunderbrush closed behind him and swallowed him up, though the lurid\r\nglare of the fire gave those in the camp occasional glimpses of his\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nBomba made his way toward the tree he sought, and, reaching it, set\r\ndown the pail and drew his machete.\r\n\r\nHe drove the knife through the bark and into the body of the tree as\r\nfar as his strength permitted. Then he drew the knife down in a long\r\nvertical slash.\r\n\r\nHe pulled the blade out, lifted the pail, held it under the cut and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments a sticky sap began to exude from the tree, at first\r\nslowly, and then more rapidly. Soon it was trickling in a thin stream\r\ninto the pail.\r\n\r\nIt was eerie work waiting there, where he knew that greenish-yellow\r\neyes were watching him from the jungle, only deterred for the moment\r\nfrom coming nearer by the light that came from the fire. But Bomba\r\nhad learned patience in the hard school of the jungle, and he stood\r\nlike a statue, the pail in one hand, his machete in the other ready\r\nfor instant use, until the receptacle was nearly full.\r\n\r\nThen he took it and, tilting it slightly so that a thin but steady\r\nstream fell on the leaves that carpeted the jungle, he made the\r\ncircuit of the camp.\r\n\r\nThe white rubber hunters caught sight of him at intervals during his\r\ncourse, and watched his progress with bated breath.\r\n\r\n“What on earth do you suppose the boy is doing?” asked Dorn.\r\n\r\n“Looks as though he were weaving some magic charm out there,”\r\nmuttered Gillis. “Something perhaps that he has learned from the\r\nwitch doctors of the region. It’s making me creepy! It’s uncanny!”\r\n\r\nThe men were immensely relieved when Bomba at last emerged from the\r\nshadows, put down his empty pail, and seated himself on a stump near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“What have you been doing?” asked Gillis.\r\n\r\nBomba picked up the pail.\r\n\r\n“Feel,” he said, pointing to the interior.\r\n\r\nGillis put his finger on the bottom of the pail, and when he withdrew\r\nit, it was covered with a pale, yellow, sticky substance. It felt\r\nuncomfortable, and he tried to rub it off with a bit of cloth. But\r\nthis he found was almost impossible.\r\n\r\n“Sticks closer than a brother,” he muttered. “What is it and where\r\ndid you get it?”\r\n\r\n“From the tree,” replied Bomba. “I stuck my knife in the tree and\r\nhurt it. The tree wept. These are the tears of the tree.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” exclaimed Dorn, “the boy’s a poet.”\r\n\r\n“Right enough,” agreed Gillis. “What he means, of course, is that he\r\ntapped the tree and got this gum-like sap from it. But why did you do\r\nit and what have you done with most of the sap?” he asked, addressing\r\nhimself to Bomba.\r\n\r\n“I spilled it on the leaves all around the camp,” said Bomba. “It is\r\ngood for us and bad for the jaguars.”\r\n\r\nThe men looked at each other in perplexity.\r\n\r\n“Can you make out what he’s getting at?” asked Dorn of his companion.\r\n\r\n“Not in the least,” replied Gillis. “It’s all Greek to me. How is it\r\nbad for the jaguars?” he asked Bomba.\r\n\r\n“The jaguars step on it,” explained Bomba. “The leaves stick to their\r\nfeet. They try to shake them off. But the leaves stick. Then they try\r\nto rub them off with their heads. The leaves stick to their heads.\r\nThe gum gets in their eyes. It is bitter. It makes them blind. They\r\nget frightened. They cannot see where they are going. They forget all\r\nabout the white man and the meat. They cry. They run. That is all.”\r\n\r\nThe men looked at each other, struck dumb with amazement.\r\n\r\n“That is all!” exclaimed Gillis, when he had recovered his breath.\r\n“By ginger, it’s enough!”\r\n\r\n“I should say it was,” agreed Dorn. “Boy, I take off my hat to you.”\r\n\r\nAs he was bareheaded at the moment, Bomba was a little puzzled at\r\nthis, but he sensed the warm approval of the white men, and his heart\r\nrejoiced. He, too, was white, and he had made his brothers happy.\r\n\r\nHe thought it well, however, to add a word of warning.\r\n\r\n“You must keep the iron sticks ready,” he said. “Most of the jaguars\r\nwill be stopped by the gum. But some of them, maybe one, two, three,\r\nwill miss the leaves that stick and they will get into the camp.”\r\n\r\n“We can probably handle them,” said Gillis. “At any rate we’ll do\r\nour best. I only wish we had more brushwood to keep the fire going\r\nstrong. But we hadn’t counted on this wholesale raid, and now it\r\nwould be as much as one’s life was worth to go into the forest for\r\nmore. We’ll have to worry along as best we can.”\r\n\r\nHaving to husband their resources, they could only maintain a\r\nmoderate fire, and as the hours wore on they had to be still more\r\neconomical in feeding it.\r\n\r\nAs the zone of light narrowed they knew that their enemies were\r\ncreeping closer, waiting only for the most opportune moment of\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThey had put the camp into the best position for defense that\r\ncircumstances permitted. The natives had been warned of the danger\r\nand had spears and arrows ready, though the white men knew that they\r\nwould be far more ready to run than fight when the pinch came.\r\n\r\nToward midnight a sudden spitting and snarling rose on one side\r\nof the camp, to be taken up shortly on the other. There came the\r\nsound of heavy bodies rolling about in the underbrush and crashing\r\nthrough thickets. All the natural caution of the cat tribe seemed to\r\nhave been abandoned in a rush of panic terror. The snarls and roars\r\nswelled into a hideous din that made the natives quake with fear, but\r\nthat the white men understood.\r\n\r\nBomba’s spell was working!\r\n\r\nBut though they exulted, they did not abate one jot of their\r\nvigilance.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for them that they did not, for a few minutes later\r\na huge, tawny body came hurtling through the air, landed within\r\ntwenty feet of Gillis, and crouched for a second spring.\r\n\r\nTwo rifles spoke simultaneously with the twang of Bomba’s bow. The\r\njaguar quivered, rolled over on its side, and lay still.\r\n\r\nWhile their eyes were still fastened on it there came a roar from\r\nanother direction, and a second jaguar landed behind Gillis and\r\nDorn. They turned and fired, but so hurriedly that they either\r\nmissed or only slightly wounded the animal. Before they could fire\r\nagain it would be upon them! They dodged and clubbed their rifles,\r\nhorror-stricken, awaiting the attack.\r\n\r\nLike a flash Bomba drew his machete.\r\n\r\nThe beast launched itself in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBEATEN OFF\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the air whizzed a gleaming, long, razor-edged knife that\r\nburied itself in the jaguar’s throat!\r\n\r\nThe stricken jaguar landed on the spot where but a moment before,\r\nGillis and Dorn had stood, and sprawled out in a heap. It made\r\none or two frantic digs at its throat in the attempt to dislodge\r\nthe machete. But it had gone deep and the beast’s efforts were\r\nunavailing. A few convulsive struggles, and it was dead.\r\n\r\nAmazed at this sudden end of their foe, the men approached it\r\ncautiously and prodded it with the butts of their guns. But there was\r\nno movement. The knife had done its work effectively.\r\n\r\nDorn’s eyes caught sight of the handle of the weapon, and he stooped\r\ndown and drew it out, though he had to tug hard to get it. He held it\r\nup before his astonished companion.\r\n\r\n“How did this get there?” asked Gillis.\r\n\r\n“It is mine,” said Bomba, coming up and reaching out his hand to\r\nreclaim it.\r\n\r\n“Yours?” demanded Dorn. “Why, you weren’t near enough to stab the\r\nbeast!”\r\n\r\n“I threw it,” said Bomba, wiping the knife on the grass and slipping\r\nit back into his belt.\r\n\r\n“G—great Scott!” stuttered Dorn. “He—he threw it!”\r\n\r\n“And threw it as straight as he shot the arrow!” ejaculated Gillis.\r\n“And with so much force that you had all that you could do to draw it\r\nout. Boy, you’re a wonder! You saved the life of one or both of us!”\r\n\r\n“I was glad to help you,” said Bomba, showing all his white teeth in\r\na happy smile. “But now we must put the jaguars near the edge of the\r\nwoods where the others will see them.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the idea?” queried Gillis. “So that they can’t feast on them\r\nand not be so hungry after us?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bomba. “The others will not eat them. They fight and kill\r\neach other when they are angry, but they do not eat one another. But\r\nwhen the live ones see these dead ones, they will know that this\r\nplace is not good for jaguars, and they will go away.”\r\n\r\n“Sounds reasonable,” said Gillis. “But whether the plan works or\r\nnot, what this boy says goes. I’m frank to confess that he’s got me\r\nbuffaloed. If he hadn’t been here to-night, you and I would have been\r\ndead men, Dorn.”\r\n\r\n“He’s saved the camp all right,” assented Dorn, as he directed some\r\nof the natives to drag the heavy bodies to the places that Bomba\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nThat the sight of their dead kindred daunted whatever other jaguars\r\nmight have intended to make an onslaught on the camp, seemed clear as\r\ntime went on. The jungle was vocal, as it always is at night, with\r\nthe strident notes of insects, the howling of monkeys, and now and\r\nthen the distant bellow of an anaconda.\r\n\r\nBut the jaguars seemed to have taken themselves off. Bomba’s keen\r\nears could no longer detect the subdued growling and purring of the\r\nfour-footed raiders, the soft thud of their padding feet. Nor were\r\nhis nostrils conscious of their presence.\r\n\r\nAfter a full hour had passed, he relaxed his tense attitude,\r\nstretched, and yawned.\r\n\r\n“They have gone,” he announced.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?” asked Gillis, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“They have gone,” repeated Bomba. “And they will tell the others.\r\nThey will not come back. I will sleep.”\r\n\r\n“Go to it, my boy,” said Dorn. “You’ve earned it, if ever anyone did.\r\nI don’t know what we’d have done without you.”\r\n\r\n“Our name would have been Dennis,” declared Gillis.\r\n\r\n“I thought your name was Gillis,” said Bomba wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“It is,” was the laughing reply. “I keep forgetting that you don’t\r\nknow our slang. I mean our name would have been mud—there I go again.\r\nWhat I mean to say is that we would have been killed if you had not\r\nbeen here.”\r\n\r\nBomba made up his mind that he would remember these new words so\r\nthat he could talk like the white men. He already had a precious\r\ncollection, “goat,” “mud,” “Dennis,” “shindig.” And there had been\r\nothers, too, that he would try to recall. He would tell them to\r\nCasson and show him how much he had learned. But just now he was very\r\nsleepy.\r\n\r\n“I’ll get you some blankets to lie on,” said Gillis.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bomba, “I will sleep this way.”\r\n\r\nHe threw himself down on the ground near the fire, and in a moment\r\nwas fast asleep.\r\n\r\nBut there was no sleep just then for Gillis or Dorn. They were too\r\nwrought up by the dreadful experiences through which they had gone to\r\nclose their eyes. So they sat with their rifles on their knees until\r\nthe first faint tinge of dawn showed in the east. Then they knew that\r\nthe danger was past, for that night at least, and after summoning a\r\ncouple of natives and placing them on watch, they threw themselves\r\nwearily on their blankets in a sleep of utter exhaustion.\r\n\r\nBomba was the first to awake, and for a moment found it hard to\r\nrealize where he was. He sat up, looked around, and caught sight of\r\nthe bodies of the jaguars. Then all the events of the stirring night\r\ncame back to him.\r\n\r\nHe had borne himself well in circumstances that might have made grown\r\nmen quail. He had met death face to face, and it had been a matter\r\nof touch and go whether he would escape unscathed. But the fortune\r\nthat favors the brave had been with him, and he had not a scratch. He\r\nhad trapped the cooanaradi. He had slain one jaguar and foiled the\r\nothers. It was natural that he should be filled with a feeling of\r\nexultation.\r\n\r\nBut far above the satisfaction at his own safety was that which came\r\nfrom the thought that he had saved the white men. Without him, they\r\nwould surely have been doomed! He had established his right to be\r\nregarded as a brother. He had vindicated his white skin.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-four hours he had gone far. A new world had opened before\r\nhim. He had crossed a chasm that separated him from his own race.\r\nHe had realized some of the dreams, answered some of the questions,\r\nsolved some of the mysteries that for a long time past had been\r\ntormenting him.\r\n\r\nBut he realized that he still had far to go. How much these white men\r\nknew! In what a different world they moved! How far superior they\r\nseemed to him! How ignorant he was, compared to them!\r\n\r\nBut he would learn. He would ask Casson. Casson must know all the\r\nthings the other white men knew. And then his heart sank, as he\r\nrealized that Casson seemed to have forgotten all or almost all that\r\nhe had ever known. There was little help to be expected from the man\r\nwith whom Bomba lived.\r\n\r\nHe was engrossed in these meditations when Gillis opened his eyes.\r\nThey fell on Bomba, and recollection came into them.\r\n\r\n“How does our hero feel this morning?” asked Gillis, with a genial\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“What is a hero?” asked Bomba, with his usual directness.\r\n\r\n“Why, you fill the bill as well as anyone I ever saw,” returned\r\nGillis. “A hero is a man or boy who isn’t afraid.”\r\n\r\n“But I was afraid last night,” said Bomba.\r\n\r\n“I guess we all were,” remarked Gillis. “Well then, a hero is one\r\nwho, even if he is afraid, doesn’t let fear get the best of him, but\r\nfights on and makes up his mind to keep on fighting till he dies. And\r\nthat’s what you’d have done last night if it had come to that. But\r\nit’s getting pretty late, and we’ll have to get a move on.”\r\n\r\nHe shook Dorn awake, gave some orders to the natives, and soon the\r\ncamp was alive with preparations for breakfast.\r\n\r\nThis time Bomba took his knife and fork at the outset, and was\r\ngratified to note that he could already handle them much better than\r\nhe had on the night before.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, my boy,” said Gillis, after they had enjoyed a hearty\r\nmeal, “we’ll have to be packing and getting on our way. As we told\r\nyou last night, we’d like nothing better than to have you go along\r\nwith us. Still think you can’t, eh?”\r\n\r\n“I should like to go,” replied Bomba, and the look in his eyes was\r\nmuch more eloquent than words. “But Casson is old and sick. He has\r\nbeen good to me. I have to get his food for him. He would die if I\r\nshould go.”\r\n\r\n“That settles it then, of course,” said Gillis regretfully. “But\r\ndon’t you think, my boy, that we’re going to forget you. We owe you\r\ntoo much for that. Either we’ll come back, or we’ll send someone\r\nelse to get you and Casson out of this jungle and bring you where\r\nyou belong. In the meantime, we want to do something to show you how\r\ngrateful we are. You saved our lives, and we want to do something for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“You do not have to give me anything,” said Bomba, simply. “I was\r\nglad to help you.”\r\n\r\n“All the same, you’ll have to take something,” put in Dorn. “The\r\nquestion is, what shall it be? The boy can get all the food he wants,\r\nand I don’t suppose he has any use for money.”\r\n\r\n“What is money?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe men laughed.\r\n\r\n“About the most important thing in the world outside this jungle,”\r\nsaid Gillis. “This is money,” and he took a gold piece from his pouch\r\nand spun it on the rude board that served as a table.\r\n\r\n“It is pretty,” said Bomba.\r\n\r\n“A good many people think so,” remarked Gillis, dryly. “Some would\r\nsell their soul for it.”\r\n\r\n“What is a soul?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\n“You’re getting in deep, Gillis,” laughed Dorn.\r\n\r\n“I sure am with this animated interrogation mark,” returned his\r\ncomrade. “The soul is the best part of us, the part that makes men\r\ngood and wise and brave, that makes them different from the animals.”\r\n\r\n“Have I got a soul then?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\n“You sure have,” replied Gillis. “And one of the best, if you ask me.\r\nBut we’re getting off the subject. We want to give you something that\r\nyou would like to have. I wonder what it would be.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes roved about and caught sight of a harmonica that lay in one\r\nof the packs they had brought along for trading with the natives.\r\n\r\n“How would you like this?” he asked of Bomba, as he picked it up and\r\nhanded it to him.\r\n\r\nBomba examined it curiously. He liked its smoothness and its glitter.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Let me show you,” said Gillis, as he took it from him, put it to his\r\nmouth, and played a few bars of a popular air.\r\n\r\nBomba was amazed and delighted.\r\n\r\n“It is like a bird!” he exclaimed. “It sings!”\r\n\r\n“Try it yourself,” said Gillis, handing it over. “Blow your breath\r\ninto it and draw your breath back.”\r\n\r\nBomba did so, and although the notes he brought from it were\r\nmeaningless and discordant, they thrilled him with rapture. He could\r\nmake music like the white men.\r\n\r\n“Keep it,” said Gillis, highly pleased at the lad’s delight. “It’s\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\n“It is good to give me this,” said Bomba gratefully, as he fondled\r\nhis treasure. It was the first present he had ever had in his life.\r\n\r\n“We’d feel cheap enough if we let it go at that,” said Dorn. “How\r\nabout giving the boy a revolver? You saw how curious he was about\r\nfirearms.”\r\n\r\n“Right enough,” assented Gillis, as he went into the tent and\r\nreturned with a shining new five-chambered revolver. “Here, Bomba,\r\nyou liked the big iron stick. This is a little iron stick, but it\r\ndoes very much the same thing as the big one.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, are you going to give me that?” exclaimed Bomba, scarcely able\r\nto believe his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Sure thing,” said Gillis. “Here, let me show you how it works.”\r\n\r\nHe broke the revolver, and Bomba gave a gasp of dismay.\r\n\r\n“You broke it!” he exclaimed in grief.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” replied Gillis. “I have to do that to load it.\r\nSee, this is the way it is done.”\r\n\r\nHe put cartridges in the five chambers, while Bomba watched him\r\nbreathlessly. Then he snapped the stock back and looked around for a\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nOne of the dead jaguars caught his eye, and he emptied the revolver\r\ninto the carcass, firing so rapidly that it seemed almost one\r\ncontinuous explosion.\r\n\r\n“Now go take a look at the jaguar,” said Gillis. “You’ll find five\r\nholes that weren’t in it before.”\r\n\r\nBomba confirmed this with his eyes. It still seemed to him like\r\nmagic, and there was awe mingled with delight in his ownership of the\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\n“Let me put five more holes in the jaguar,” he begged.\r\n\r\nGillis loaded it for him and gave him directions how to hold, aim,\r\nand fire the weapon, though he and Dorn took care to take their stand\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nIn the tyro’s hands only one more perforation marked the jaguar’s\r\nhide, the rest missing the mark through Bomba’s unfamiliarity with\r\nthe weapon and his failure to allow for its kick.\r\n\r\n“All right for a beginner,” commented Gillis. “With your natural\r\nkeenness of eye you’ll be a crack shot as soon as you get used to the\r\ngun and have a little more practice. I only wish we had more time to\r\nteach you. But Casson will give you lessons, and in a little while\r\nyou can shoot as straight with this as you can with your bow.”\r\n\r\nMany boxes of cartridges accompanied the gift, and Bomba tucked them\r\naway carefully in his pouch, feeling as rich as Croesus. It had\r\ncertainly been a lucky day for him when he had come across the white\r\nmen!\r\n\r\nBut his delight in his treasure was dimmed when, a little while\r\nlater, all preparations were completed and the party got ready to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nThe rubber hunters themselves, steeled adventurers as they were, were\r\ndeeply stirred as they shook hands with Bomba and bade him good-bye.\r\nThey had become strongly attached to this lad, who had come upon\r\nthem so strangely, and to whom, no doubt, they owed their lives.\r\nThere was tragic pathos in his loneliness in these vast wilds with\r\nonly a half-demented old man to bear him company.\r\n\r\n“You’ll hear from us again, remember that,” promised Gillis. “We’re\r\nnot going to let this thing drop. We will come back or send back for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” said Bomba. “If you do not come, my name will be mud.”\r\n\r\nThe men could not help smiling, and Bomba was proud. He was showing\r\nthem that he could talk like the white men.\r\n\r\nThey waved a final farewell and took up their journey through the\r\njungle. Bomba watched them until the underbrush hid them from view.\r\n\r\nThe world suddenly became very empty. His eyes were filled with tears.\r\n\r\nHe stood there for a long time, trying to still the ache in his\r\nheart. Then he turned his face toward the south. He must get back to\r\nCasson.\r\n\r\nDear old Casson! Kind old Casson! His heart thrilled with affection.\r\nHe, at least, was left to him.\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that Bomba had been away over night from\r\nthe hut that sheltered him and the old naturalist. He was the\r\nprovider of food, and his hunting trips had often carried him far\r\nafield. But he was always uneasy when that occurred and anxious to\r\nget back as soon as possible, for Casson was in no condition to be\r\nleft alone any more than was necessary.\r\n\r\nHaving made sure that the revolver, the harmonica, and the matches\r\nwere safely bestowed in his pouch, Bomba started on his homeward\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nRefreshed by his night’s sleep and good breakfast, he made good\r\nprogress for the first two hours. Then his exertions began to tell\r\nand his pace slackened, though he was still making remarkably good\r\ntime, considering that for part of the way he had to hack a path\r\nthrough the underbrush with his machete.\r\n\r\nOn his way he passed the place of his encounter with the cooanaradi.\r\nOnly the skeleton of the snake remained. And from the cleanness with\r\nwhich the frame had been stripped, Bomba conjectured that the ants\r\nhad been at work.\r\n\r\nSome distance further on, he came upon the ashes of a fire. Some of\r\nthe embers were still smouldering and scraps of meat lay scattered\r\nabout. Some natives out on a hunt had evidently stopped there for a\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nThis was a common enough occurrence and gave the lad no special\r\nconcern. The Indians of the vicinity, though not especially friendly,\r\nwere not hostile. They were uneasy at the presence of the whites,\r\nwhom they looked upon as intruders, but up to the present they had\r\nbeen content to leave them alone, and Casson and Bomba on their part\r\nhad held aloof from the natives as much as possible.\r\n\r\nSo Bomba was not alarmed when he caught sight of an Indian a little\r\nto one side but moving along on a forest trail that crossed the one\r\nthat he was pursuing. They reached the junction of the trails at\r\nabout the same time. The Indian turned and looked at the lad.\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart gave a sudden leap. He saw a symbol painted in ochre\r\non the Indian’s chest. It was the symbol of the head-hunters, the\r\nferocious tribe from the Giant Cataract!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIN THE PUMA’S DEN\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba had never before come face to face with a member of the tribe\r\nof head-hunters. Only at rare intervals had any of these men of evil\r\nomen invaded that section of the jungle where he and Casson lived.\r\n\r\nBut when they had come they had left behind them a wake of death and\r\ndestruction. They were cruel and ruthless. They sought for heads as\r\nthe North American Indians used to seek for scalps with which to\r\nadorn their wigwams and testify to their valor.\r\n\r\nOne of these dreadful trophies hung at the belt of the Indian who now\r\nstood regarding Bomba with a scowl that sent a chill to the boy’s\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba let no sign of apprehension show itself on his face, which\r\nhad been schooled to repression and self-control by his jungle\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary he smiled amicably and put up his hands, palms\r\noutward, as a sign of peace and good will.\r\n\r\n“Good hunting, brother?” he asked, in the language that with certain\r\nvariations was common to all the tribes of the region and with which\r\nhe was perfectly familiar.\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” the Indian grunted noncommittally, as he scanned Bomba with\r\nglowering eyes that had in them nothing of friendliness. “You white\r\nboy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Bomba.\r\n\r\n“You live with white man that has long hair and walks with a stick?”\r\npursued the Indian.\r\n\r\nBomba nodded.\r\n\r\n“The white man bad medicine,” said the Indian, his scowl deepening\r\nand his hand tightening on his spear.\r\n\r\n“He is good medicine,” declared Bomba.\r\n\r\n“He is a Man of Evil,” was the reply. “He bring trouble on my people.\r\nMuch sickness. Many die. Chief Nascanora very angry. He make talk\r\nwith big medicine man, and medicine man say there will always be\r\nsickness as long as white man stay alive.”\r\n\r\nA thrill of apprehension ran through Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Old white man is good man,” he protested energetically. “He hurts\r\nnobody. He would like to cure people, not make them sick. He has been\r\nhere many years. He is a brother. He has a good heart.”\r\n\r\n“He is a Man of Evil,” repeated the other doggedly. “Medicine man say\r\nso. Medicine man know. Tribe will have trouble, much trouble, unless\r\nold white man die.”\r\n\r\nBomba tried to collect his thoughts, which had been thrown into a\r\ntumult by these ominous words. It came to him that perhaps this\r\nman was an emissary of death chosen by the tribe to accomplish its\r\npurpose. If this were so, Bomba, boy though he was, would have been\r\nready to do battle with him for the life of Casson.\r\n\r\nBut if the man were not alone, if companions were near at hand, that\r\nwould put another aspect on the matter. Then craft and strategy would\r\nhave to make up for the disparity of numbers.\r\n\r\n“My brother has come a long way,” Bomba said, changing the subject.\r\n“The home of his people is near the Giant Cataract. Why has my\r\nbrother come so far from his own people to do his hunting alone?”\r\n\r\n“I am not alone,” was the answer. “Many of my people are near me. If\r\nI call, they will come.”\r\n\r\nBomba had learned what he wanted to know. This was but a straying\r\nmember of a large party. The news was not reassuring, but it showed\r\nhim where he stood. At all costs he must avoid a combat at this\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nHis revolver, fully loaded, was at his belt and, despite his\r\nunfamiliarity with the weapon, he could not have missed at such close\r\nrange. But the report would have summoned the man’s companions, who\r\nwere probably not far away.\r\n\r\nSo he restrained his impulse to draw it, and without any betrayal\r\nof fear smiled into the man’s face, waved his hand carelessly in\r\nfarewell, and passed on. In a moment the jungle had swallowed him up.\r\n\r\nThe Indian had made an instinctive movement with his spear, and then\r\nchecked himself and stood undecided. The dauntless bearing of the boy\r\ndisconcerted him.\r\n\r\nBomba, the instant he felt sure that his movements were hidden from\r\nthe native, dropped his careless attitude and made his way with all\r\nthe haste of which he was capable through the jungle. He must reach\r\ntheir hut as soon as possible and warn Casson—poor, helpless, old\r\nCasson—who would be an easy prey if the enemy came upon him unawares.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far before he heard a loud shout behind him. This was\r\nfollowed a moment later by answering shouts from many directions.\r\n\r\nHe knew at once what they meant. The Indian had summoned those of\r\nhis companions who happened to be within earshot. There would be a\r\nhurried gathering, a hubbub of exclamations, and then, like a pack of\r\nwild animals, they would be upon his trail.\r\n\r\nBomba was as lithe and strong as a young panther, and if the going\r\nhad been reasonably clear, he could probably have distanced the\r\nhead-hunters. But he had the disadvantage of having to make a path in\r\nmany places as he went along. He had to hack his way often through\r\ntangled thickets, and this took up precious time. His enemies, on the\r\ncontrary, could follow without stopping the very path that he had\r\nmade with infinite labor. It was one of the ironies of his situation\r\nthat he was making the way easier for his pursuers. He was actually\r\nhelping them to overtake him.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, it was only a matter of time before they would\r\ncatch up with him. Already he could tell by the crashing of the\r\nunderbrush that they were nearer.\r\n\r\nBut he kept on, spurred by desperation. His lungs were laboring, his\r\nbreath coming in shorter and ever shorter gasps. He was reaching the\r\nlimit of his endurance. The end could not be long delayed.\r\n\r\nAs his eyes roved frantically from right to left, he caught sight of\r\nan opening in the side of a small knoll a little way off from the\r\ndirection in which he was headed.\r\n\r\nHis pursuers were close behind him now. At any moment the foremost of\r\nthem might appear in sight.\r\n\r\nLike a flash, Bomba turned in the direction of the cave and bolted\r\ninto it headlong, pitching at full length on the ground within.\r\n\r\nHe lay there in the semi-darkness panting heavily, trying to regain\r\nhis breath, the little that he had left having been knocked out of\r\nhim by the fall.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the rush of the pursuers as they passed by in the\r\ndirection he had been heading, and he breathed a sigh of heartfelt\r\nrelief as he heard their steps receding in the distance. For the\r\nmoment he was saved.\r\n\r\nBut he knew this was only a reprieve. It would not be long before his\r\nenemies would realize that they were on a false trail. They would\r\nmiss the sound of his steps, the marks of his machete on the bushes.\r\nThen they would retrace their steps and search every nook or cranny\r\nin which he might be hiding. And they could hardly fail to discover\r\nthe cave!\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could breathe again, he rose to his feet and\r\nreconnoitered the hiding place that had, temporarily at least, proved\r\nhis salvation. What his eyes could not see his touch supplied.\r\n\r\nThere was no apparent exit from the cave except the opening through\r\nwhich he had come. But at the back, partly hidden by a shelf of rock,\r\nwas a small crevice only a few inches wide. It seemed impossible at\r\nfirst that it could permit the passage of his body. But by placing\r\nhimself sidewise and drawing in his breath he finally managed to\r\nworm his way through and found footing on the other side.\r\n\r\nNow he could breathe more freely. He could crouch down in the narrow\r\npassage behind the crevice and be concealed from the sight of anyone\r\nat the entrance of the cave. To a casual observer the cave would seem\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nAnd even if a careful search were made and his hiding place\r\ndiscovered, he would be in a natural fortress. No arrow or spear\r\ncould reach him. An Indian would be too big to wriggle through that\r\ncrevice, and if he tried to do so, he would be at the mercy of the\r\nlad’s knife or pistol while he was making the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe first glow of exultation had barely subsided when Bomba could\r\ntell by the sounds outside that his enemies were returning. He could\r\nhear a babble of voices and grunts of rage and disappointment at the\r\nescape of their prey.\r\n\r\nHe crouched low behind his barricade, scarcely daring to breathe.\r\n\r\nThe steps came nearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly there was a guttural exclamation of surprise mingled\r\nwith triumph, and he knew that they had discovered the entrance to\r\nhis hiding place.\r\n\r\nThe shout was followed by dead silence, which Bomba was at no loss to\r\ninterpret.\r\n\r\nHis enemies knew that if he were there he would be desperate,\r\nfighting with his back against the wall. None of them was eager to\r\nbe the first to enter and face him. There was no need for impetuous\r\naction. If he were there, he could not escape.\r\n\r\nSo they were drawing stealthily nearer, probably from the side, so as\r\nto escape a possible whizzing arrow, the only weapon with which they\r\nthought he would be equipped.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes the deathlike silence continued. Bomba could feel,\r\nthough he could not see, that fierce, keen eyes were peering in,\r\ntrying to pierce the darkness that at the back of the cave was almost\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\nThen came a hissing sound, and a flaming torch was thrown into the\r\ncave, its flaring light illuminating every crevice of the interior.\r\n\r\nApparently it was empty. If the fugitive had entered there, it seemed\r\nevident that he must have escaped by some other exit.\r\n\r\nTo discover that other exit, if there were one, several of the\r\nIndians crowded into the cave, and one of them picked up the torch to\r\nmake a more thorough search.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely done so before a terrific hubbub arose from his\r\ncompanions on the outside of the cave. Something had frightened them.\r\n\r\nThe men within rushed out, and there was a snapping and crashing as\r\nthe whole party forced its way through the underbrush, evidently in\r\npanic flight.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened? Bomba asked himself. Was one terror to be\r\nsucceeded by another?\r\n\r\nHe listened with all his ears. There was no sound except that caused\r\nby the stampede of the Indians, now steadily growing fainter.\r\n\r\nMinutes passed and still no sound. The strain became unendurable.\r\n\r\nSlowly, very slowly, Bomba raised his head and peered over his\r\nbarricade.\r\n\r\nAll he saw was a shadow.\r\n\r\nBut that was enough to chill his blood.\r\n\r\nFor the shadow that lay on the ground before the cave was that of a\r\ngiant puma, one of the fiercest inhabitants of the Amazonian wilds!\r\n\r\nThe owner of the cave had returned!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA SIEGE OF TERROR\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Bomba’s heart seemed to cease beating.\r\n\r\nDown he went again behind his barrier, while he tried to collect his\r\nthoughts in the presence of this new peril.\r\n\r\nThe thought that this might be the den of a wild beast had occurred\r\nto him when he first saw the mouth of the cave, but it had been\r\ncrowded out by his desperate need of escaping from his human enemies.\r\n\r\nNow he realized that he was trapped. There was not one chance in a\r\nhundred that the beast would stay outside for long. Sooner or later\r\nit would enter the cave to rest in readiness for its nocturnal\r\nhunting. And when it did come in, discovery would be certain.\r\n\r\nIn Bomba’s crouching position the animal could not see him. But it\r\nwould smell him and follow the scent to the crevice in the rock.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, it could not get at him. Its huge body could not squeeze\r\nthrough the narrow opening. But when it once became convinced of\r\nthis it would settle down to a long siege that would doom its captive\r\nto certain starvation.\r\n\r\nOnce more Bomba ventured a peep at the shadow. It had changed its\r\nshape. At first the beast had been standing. Now the shadow showed\r\nthat it was stretched out on the ground, but with its head uplifted,\r\nwatching perhaps for the possible return of the Indians that its\r\ncoming had frightened off.\r\n\r\nThat shadow had a dreadful fascination for Bomba. He watched it as\r\nthough under a spell, waiting for the moment when it would change in\r\nshape, when the great tawny beast would rise, shake itself, yawn, and\r\nat last enter the cave.\r\n\r\nIn the position in which Bomba found himself, he could use what\r\nweapons he had only with great difficulty. The passage was so narrow\r\nthat he had no room to draw his bow. That rendered his arrows useless.\r\n\r\nAnd the crevice was so located with reference to his body that he\r\ncould only use his knife or revolver with his left hand.\r\n\r\nAs to hurling his knife, as he had in the case of the jaguar, he\r\ncould not draw his arm back to get sufficient force for the throw.\r\nAnd he was so little used to the revolver, even with his right hand,\r\nthat the chance of his being able to aim accurately with the left was\r\nalmost negligible.\r\n\r\nHis heart sank as he realized his helplessness. He seemed doomed to\r\ndie like a rat in a trap.\r\n\r\nWhile he was bitterly pondering his situation, the shadow moved. Like\r\na shot Bomba’s face disappeared from the crevice through which he had\r\nbeen peering, and he crouched down low, fearful lest the beast should\r\neven hear the sound of his heart thumping against his ribs.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the padding feet of the puma as it leisurely entered\r\nthe cave. Then there came a sudden pause, a sniff, an ominous growl.\r\n\r\nThe beast had scented the proximity of a human being. Bomba knew\r\nthat its hair was bristling, its eyes glowing, as they roamed about\r\nseeking to discover the whereabouts of the intruder.\r\n\r\nThen the padding was resumed, and the steps drew nearer his hiding\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThere was a thunderous roar and the beast dashed violently against\r\nthe wall, as though it would batter it down by the sheer force of its\r\nimpact.\r\n\r\nThree times this was repeated. Then, as though recognizing the\r\nfutility of this form of attack, the animal desisted. The roars were\r\nreplaced with snarls, as the puma tried to force its body through the\r\nnarrow opening.\r\n\r\nIt struggled viciously to get through, but its huge bulk prevented.\r\nFoiled in this, it reached one of its great paws through the opening\r\nand swung it about, trying to get a grip with its claws on whatever\r\nwas in that passage and drag it out within reach of its jaws.\r\n\r\nBomba shrank as far away as possible, being just able to escape the\r\nsweep of the powerful claw that would have torn into ribbons whatever\r\nit clutched.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the baffled beast sought to reach its prey, but\r\nwithout success.\r\n\r\nAt last it desisted and paced the floor of the cave with growls\r\nand roars that in that narrow space were almost deafening. Then it\r\nsettled down to a siege. Its instinct told it that sooner or later\r\nthe trapped enemy must die of starvation, or come out to meet a fate\r\nquicker but more terrible.\r\n\r\nBomba felt sick and weak under the strain. He had escaped that\r\nterrible paw only by inches.\r\n\r\nHis only chance seemed to be that the beast at last might sleep. Then\r\nBomba might creep through the narrow opening and either steal from\r\nthe cave or at least have elbow room to battle for his life with\r\nknife and revolver.\r\n\r\nBut he dismissed this forlorn hope even as it came to him. If the\r\nbeast should doze, it would be so lightly that even the slightest\r\nsound, the fall of a leaf, would awaken him. He would be on Bomba\r\nbefore the latter had squeezed through the opening. There was no\r\nhope from that quarter.\r\n\r\nAnd with dread for his own safety was mingled the agonizing thought\r\nof what might happen to Casson, unwarned and helpless before the\r\nstorm that was brewing. Even at this moment the head-hunters might be\r\non their way to the lonely cabin.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed by. The snarls had ceased, but Bomba could hear\r\nthe stertorous breathing that told him the beast was still there,\r\nwatchful and relentless as fate.\r\n\r\nAt last he ventured a look. With infinite caution he applied his eye\r\nto the crevice in the wall. There lay the beast, a monster of its\r\nkind, its unblinking eyes turned in his direction.\r\n\r\nBut those fierce eyes had no terrors for Bomba!\r\n\r\nAstonishment, relief, delight chased themselves over the lad’s\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nHis mouth opened and a low crooning sound issued from his lips,\r\nrising and falling in a weird jungle melody.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the puma was magical. It started to its feet. The\r\nfierce light faded from its eyes, and was replaced with a look of\r\npleasure and benevolence. Then it commenced to purr.\r\n\r\n“Polulu!” murmured Bomba. “Polulu! It is Bomba speaking—Bomba, your\r\nfriend.”\r\n\r\nThe purring grew louder, and the great beast came and rubbed itself\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\nBomba hesitated no longer. He forced his body through the crevice\r\nwithout the slightest trepidation, though with some difficulty, for\r\nalready the puma was rubbing his head against him, fawning upon him\r\nlike a cat, and trying to lick his hand.\r\n\r\n“Polulu. Polulu,” murmured Bomba, as he caressed the great head\r\nfondly. “Why did I not know it was you? I would not have hidden from\r\nyou. You have given Bomba a great fright.”\r\n\r\nPolulu purred still more loudly and rubbed his head so hard against\r\nBomba as to almost knock him over. Then the beast lay down and rolled\r\nover and over to testify his joy at the meeting.\r\n\r\nFor the last two years a warm affection had existed between the two.\r\nIt had taken birth at the time the big puma had been caught by a\r\nfalling tree that had imprisoned and broken one of its hind legs.\r\n\r\nBomba had come upon the tortured animal at a time when it was\r\nsuffering terribly and biting savagely at the injured leg. The boy\r\nwas stirred with compassion. He had a strange power over animals, and\r\nthe puma had sensed his sympathy.\r\n\r\nBomba had brought the animal food and water. Then he had set to work\r\nto free the trapped leg. This accomplished, he had set and bound up\r\nthe injured member, the puma submitting to the treatment because it\r\nknew instinctively the kindness that prompted it.\r\n\r\nMany days had passed before it was able to stand and get about, and\r\nduring all this time Bomba had supplied its needs and nursed it back\r\nto health. By the time this was accomplished, the puma had all the\r\naffection for Bomba that a pet cat has for its master.\r\n\r\nRepeatedly since then the paths of the two had crossed in the jungle,\r\neach time to the joy of both. At times, Polulu had been accompanied\r\nby its savage mates that would have attacked the boy had not Polulu\r\ntaken him under his guard and warned the others that the boy must be\r\nimmune.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes Bomba fondled and caressed the great beast, which\r\nresponded with equal affection and manifestations of delight.\r\n\r\nThen the pressing need for haste forced itself on the boy, and with a\r\nparting pat on the tawny head he rose and issued from the cave.\r\n\r\nPolulu was disappointed at the briefness of the lad’s stay, and made\r\nas though he would go with him. But Bomba gently waved him back and\r\nthe puma obeyed meekly. And in the lambent yellow eyes that stared\r\nafter him Bomba could read regret and desolation.\r\n\r\nImmeasurably relieved in mind as the boy was at his unexpected escape\r\nat the moment that death had seemed to be closing in on him, he was\r\ntormented by the thought of the precious time that had been lost by\r\nhis enforced stay in the cave. Now he must redouble his speed, at the\r\nsame time keeping a sharp lookout for the marauding Indians.\r\n\r\nHe came to the banks of a wide stream that wound in a sweeping curve\r\nthrough the jungle. To swim across it would save him a long detour on\r\nland and at least an hour of time.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily he would have taken the land route, with whose dangers he\r\nwas more familiar and better able to cope. He had a deep fear of the\r\ncaymans, the great South American alligators, that infested many of\r\nthe streams.\r\n\r\nHe could swim like a fish. But the alligators could also make amazing\r\nspeed, considering their clumsiness. And in the water the only weapon\r\nthe boy could use effectively would be his knife, and that would be\r\nbut of slender use against such a formidable foe.\r\n\r\nHe knew, however, that at this time in the day the alligators would\r\nbe apt to be sunning themselves on some of the islands that studded\r\nthe stream at intervals. One of these islands he could see at a\r\nlittle distance, with dark forms like so many logs fast asleep on the\r\nsands.\r\n\r\nHis resolve was made on the instant. He would take the chance.\r\n\r\nSilently as a shadow he slipped into the water, and, swimming so\r\nsmoothly that he scarcely left a ripple behind him, he moved toward\r\nthe point he had in view.\r\n\r\nHe had traversed more than half the distance and was already\r\nbeginning to congratulate himself on the successful outcome of his\r\nventure when he heard a splash behind him.\r\n\r\nSomething had broken the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nHe looked behind him and his heart skipped a beat.\r\n\r\nHe saw the dripping head and great open jaws of a huge cayman coming\r\ntoward him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE JAWS OF DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sight of the cayman, Bomba, for one awful instant, felt as though\r\nhe were paralyzed. Strength seemed suddenly to have left his arms and\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nBut only for a moment. The next instant the instinct of\r\nself-preservation asserted itself, and he shot forward like an arrow.\r\n\r\nHe knew he could not reach the shore before the dreadful thing would\r\nbe upon him. But he would struggle till the last. As a final resource\r\nhe had his knife.\r\n\r\nBut what would that knife avail against murderous jaws armed with a\r\nscore of knives? One nip from those jaws could sever his leg from his\r\nbody, or, if they caught him at the waist, could bite him in half.\r\n\r\nHis arms and legs were working like piston-rods. He was fairly\r\nleaping through the water. But behind him was coming a fearsome thing\r\nthat could swim still faster.\r\n\r\nStill Bomba sped on, his eyes fixed on the land steadily drawing\r\nnearer, even though the lad had the conviction that his feet would\r\nnever press that land again.\r\n\r\nThe muscles in his strong arms were strained until it seemed as\r\nthough they would burst. He breathed with difficulty. His head,\r\nsurcharged with blood, felt as though it were encircled by an iron\r\nband that was eating its way into it.\r\n\r\nOne hurried glance over his shoulder showed him that the cayman was\r\ngaining. The distance between them had sensibly diminished.\r\n\r\nAs a whole world of thoughts is said to pass through the brain of a\r\ndrowning man, so Bomba reviewed in those terrible moments the things\r\nthat had come into his life.\r\n\r\nOne thought tore a sob from his aching throat. It was of Casson,\r\npoor, gentle, bewildered Casson, left alone to face the perils of\r\nthe jungle, the jaguar, the sucurujus, the dreaded boa constrictor,\r\nand those human foes, perhaps more terrible still, bent on his\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThere was another grief, a longing bitterly poignant though but\r\nvaguely understood, that stirred his soul to the depths with agony.\r\n\r\nThe white men! He would never know now about that mysterious\r\nworld from which they had come, to which at this moment they were\r\nreturning. He would not know. He would not know!\r\n\r\nThe words beat themselves over and over in his brain, while his\r\nstraining muscles labored to snatch a few more moments from eternity.\r\n\r\nHe cast one more look behind him. The hideous brute was nearer now,\r\nthe fangs in its frightful jaws gleaming as the cayman clove the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNow it was close upon him! Bomba’s legs were instinctively drawn up\r\nto his body to escape the slash of those dreadful jaws. His hand\r\nreached for his knife.\r\n\r\nWhat was that his dimming eyes saw directly ahead of him? Bomba’s\r\nheart leaped with renewed hope as he saw that the flat object\r\nfloating almost within his reach was a rude raft—four hollow logs\r\nstrapped together with bush cord. The work of caboclos, probably, who\r\nhad later discarded it for a more convenient mode of river travel—the\r\nregatao or river canoe.\r\n\r\nCould he reach it? The splashing of the alligator was close behind\r\nhim. The brute was preparing for its spring. Every moment Bomba\r\nexpected to feel the clamp of those iron jaws, to be dragged beneath\r\nthe swirling surface to the slime and ooze of the river bed, to be\r\nfeasted on at leisure.\r\n\r\nThe boy summoned all his expiring strength in one last effort. A\r\nmighty spurt carried him a few feet ahead. He must get hold of that\r\nraft. It spelled safety, deliverance from a horrible fate. Extinction\r\nthreatened him, and like any other creature of the wild he fought\r\nmadly for his life.\r\n\r\nAnother moment and those hungry jaws would fasten on him, tear his\r\nstraining soul from his mangled body.\r\n\r\nNow the raft was only an inch from his frantic fingers—half an inch!\r\nHe touched it! He grasped it, lifted himself, slipped back, made one\r\nlast effort, pulled himself out and sprawled at full length upon the\r\nraft!\r\n\r\nHe was not a second too soon. Even as he fell prone, two vicious jaws\r\nsnapped savagely. The cayman lurched against the raft, tipping it to\r\nsuch an angle that Bomba was almost thrown into the water.\r\n\r\nBut the boy held on desperately, and the raft righted itself.\r\n\r\nAgain the brute returned to the attack. This time it flung its body\r\nhalf upon the raft and its jaws snapped within an inch of the lad’s\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nThere was a heavy paddle lying on the raft. Bomba snatched it up and\r\nbrought it down with all his force on the cayman’s snout.\r\n\r\nThe brute winced, but still continued its efforts to climb up on the\r\nfrail structure. Then Bomba jammed the stick through the gaping jaws\r\ndeep into the brute’s throat.\r\n\r\nThere was a grunt of pain and rage, and the cayman fell back into\r\nthe water that was speedily dyed with the blood that came from the\r\nwound. There was no more fight left in the creature. It swam around\r\nfor a moment, glaring with its malignant eyes at the human banquet it\r\nhad counted on, and then sank slowly from sight.\r\n\r\nBomba had won. But it had been a terrific experience. He sat down on\r\nthe raft, too utterly worn out for the moment to move a finger.\r\n\r\nBut if his body was exhausted, his mind was still active. The same\r\nsubjects that had tormented him a few minutes ago in his dreadful\r\nextremity now appeared in a roseate glow.\r\n\r\nThe white men! He would see them again. Or if not Gillis and Dorn,\r\nothers of their kind. His kind, too, he thought with a thrill of\r\nexultation.\r\n\r\nAs he lay there, his brown body glistening with river water might\r\nhave belonged to any native Amazonian. His sturdy body and rippling\r\nmuscles, too, might have been those of a caboclo, a native waterman.\r\n\r\nBut not his eyes. The dreaming look that now clouded their bright\r\nwatchfulness was a heritage of white men—the striving of a soul for\r\nascendency over mere physical things, the yearning for something\r\nhigher than an animal existence.\r\n\r\nAnd he was white! He knew it! And those men, those beings from\r\nanother world, had acknowledged that he was white. They knew. They\r\nmust know everything. And he had not had with them the alien feeling\r\nthat had always been his when he had come in contact with the\r\nIndians. He had felt at home with these white men. He liked them.\r\nThey had liked him.\r\n\r\nBut now they were gone. When would he see them again?\r\n\r\nThey had been his friends. They had given him presents. He touched\r\nthe gifts with reverent fingers. But the men had gone. Where? To some\r\nmysterious place utterly beyond his comprehension, where white men\r\ntalked and laughed a great deal and slapped each other on the back.\r\n\r\nIt must be a friendly country, thought Bomba wistfully, as he looked\r\nabout on the stream and jungle where so few things were friendly. He,\r\ntoo, would like to talk and laugh a great deal and slap people—white\r\npeople—on the back.\r\n\r\nHe had never talked much. Cody Casson was reticent. He had never\r\nlaughed much. Casson was somber.\r\n\r\nHe would like to bring about a change in the quiet little hut, to\r\ntalk and laugh with Casson. But if he could not have done that\r\nbefore, how could he do it now? Casson was no longer wise. He had\r\nforgotten all that could be talked about. He was like a little child\r\nagain, to be watched over and guarded from evil.\r\n\r\nThe thought of Casson put an end to his musings. Once more he was\r\nBomba, the jungle-trained and bred, with all the wily cunning of the\r\njungle in his eyes. No longer were those eyes dreaming, but bright\r\nand watchful as had been those of old Geluk, the puma, whose skin\r\nBomba now wore as covering.\r\n\r\nWith the paddle which had done him such good service in warding off\r\nthe attack of the alligator he rapidly propelled the rude raft toward\r\nthe jutting point where he intended to make his landing.\r\n\r\nHe soon touched and leaped upon the shore. Before him stretched a\r\nygapo, a huge swamp many miles in width. This must be crossed before\r\nhe could reach the hut. The only alternative was a roundabout route.\r\nBut the feeling that Casson might at any minute be in danger urged\r\nthe boy to take the shorter cut.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he hated the swamp. Vaguely he imagined it peopled with\r\nevil spirits. The tall crabwood trees standing in clusters threw deep\r\nshadows over the blackish-brown water, giving it an indescribably\r\ndreary and sinister appearance. Here and there, out of the slimy ooze\r\nsprang huge tree ferns. No shrieking of parrots or howling of monkeys\r\nin this cheerless spot. Nothing but dead leaves and treacherous mud,\r\nwithout the stir of a leaf or the twitter of a bird to break the\r\nbrooding silence. It might have been a lost fragment flung off from a\r\nvanished world.\r\n\r\nBomba made his way rapidly through the ygapo, heavily oppressed by\r\nthe premonition that danger lurked about the hut of Casson. In one\r\nhand he firmly grasped his faithful machete, while in the other he\r\nheld the revolver, the cherished gift of the white man.\r\n\r\nHis eyes scanned the coverts for the first sign of danger. There was\r\nlittle peril from wild beasts, who preferred the dry woodland, but he\r\nknew that reptiles might start from the slime or drop down upon him\r\nfrom the trees.\r\n\r\nHe found no use, however, for either weapon while traversing the\r\nswamp. It was not until he was nearly across the ygapo that an acrid\r\nscent assailed his nostrils.\r\n\r\nFire!\r\n\r\nHe was not alarmed at first. It was probably only Casson’s campfire\r\nbuilt outside the hut.\r\n\r\nBut in a moment he knew that the volume of smoke wafted to him by a\r\nvagrant breeze could come from no ordinary bonfire, and his steps\r\nquickened.\r\n\r\nHe reached the farther end of the ygapo. He drew himself up to the\r\nhigher level, and with relief felt solid ground beneath his feet once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBomba plunged onward, the increasing density of the smoke lending\r\nwings to his feet. No thought of Gillis and Dorn in the jungle lad’s\r\nmind now! Only room there for thought of Cody Casson! Would he reach\r\nthe hut and the old man in time?\r\n\r\nIt took Bomba only a short time to reach the trees that fringed the\r\nclearing he and Casson had made.\r\n\r\nA glance as he burst into the open told him that his worst fears were\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nThe hut was in flames!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFROM OUT THE FLAMES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few bounds Bomba was close beside the blazing hut.\r\n\r\nAs he rushed forward he shouted hoarsely:\r\n\r\n“Casson! Casson! Where are you?”\r\n\r\nA groan was his only answer. But it was enough, for it told him that\r\nhis only friend and comrade was entrapped within. Already he might\r\nhave been burned beyond any possibility of rescue.\r\n\r\nBomba acted quickly. The cloth about his body had been saturated\r\nduring his progress through the swamp. This he tore from him and\r\nswiftly bound it about his nose and mouth. For this much he knew—that\r\nto inhale that writhing, forked-tongue demon men called fire meant\r\ncertain death.\r\n\r\nTo adjust the cloth took but a few seconds. Gathering his wiry\r\nmuscles beneath him, he sprang for the flame-filled doorway of the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\nFor a moment it seemed to him that the whole world was an inferno of\r\nflame. His flesh was seared by the terrific heat.\r\n\r\nThen he was through it! The interior of the hut was filled with\r\nsmoke, the heat almost unbearable. Bomba’s eyes were smarting,\r\nblinded. He could only grope about, stumbling, calling to Casson in a\r\nstrange, cracked voice.\r\n\r\nHe almost gave up hope. He decided that Casson and he must perish\r\nthere together. Then his groping fingers touched something that moved\r\nand groaned.\r\n\r\nCould he get Casson outside the hut before the flimsy walls of it\r\ncollapsed, burying both of them in the burning debris?\r\n\r\nEven as Bomba asked himself the question, he gathered the wasted form\r\nof Casson in his strong young arms.\r\n\r\nChoking, blinded, staggering, he stumbled with his burden in the\r\ndirection he thought the doorway would be. He came in violent contact\r\nwith a wall, and was almost flung down with his helpless burden.\r\n\r\nHis lungs fairly begging for a breath of air, eyes smarting\r\nagonizingly with smoke, he regained his balance and struggled on.\r\n\r\nHe pressed Casson’s nose and mouth close against the cloth that\r\ncovered his own and groped forward until at last he found the doorway\r\nof the hut. A moment’s pause, a gathering of forces, then a mad\r\nplunge through the devouring flame into the open air beyond.\r\n\r\nBomba laid Casson on the ground at a safe distance from the blazing\r\nstructure, and with a swift motion tore the cloth from his own nose\r\nand mouth. This, which had begun to scorch from the frightful heat,\r\nhe flung to the ground and trampled upon with his sandaled feet.\r\n\r\nThen he passed a hand over his smarting, tear-filled eyes, and bent\r\nto examine Casson.\r\n\r\nThe old naturalist was conscious, and looked up at the boy with a\r\npleading look.\r\n\r\n“I’m all right,” he panted, his breath coming painfully. “Never mind\r\nme. Save the hut.”\r\n\r\nWeak as he was, he half-raised himself on his elbow and stared wildly\r\nat the hut, the only home he knew.\r\n\r\nBomba with one hand pushed the old man back not ungently on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“Bomba will put out fire,” he said, in the soothing tones one would\r\nuse to a frightened child. “You sit quiet, Casson. Watch.”\r\n\r\nWithout further delay, Bomba, set to work to save the threatened\r\nhabitation that had sheltered him and his companion for so many years.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the bulk of the fire was thus far confined to one part of\r\nthe hut. Bomba picked up a bucket, used by Casson and himself to\r\nboil the game that the boy’s hunting expeditions brought back to the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nWith this he worked like a madman, carrying water from a stream\r\nthat ran a few yards in the rear and dashing it over the untouched\r\nportions of the hut.\r\n\r\nWhen this was thoroughly saturated, he began work with his machete\r\ntearing down one flaming wall and then beating out the fire with a\r\nhuge palm-leaf broom that Casson had used to keep the interior neat.\r\n\r\nIt was hard and discouraging work. More than once Bomba felt that he\r\nwas fighting a losing battle. Not only was the hut in danger of being\r\ndestroyed, but the jungle to the rear of it was threatened.\r\n\r\nMany of the trees near by were rubber trees, and this thought helped\r\nto spur Bomba to renewed activity. Those were the kind of trees\r\nthat Gillis and Dorn had been seeking—seeking for the Apex Rubber\r\nCorporation, whatever that might mean.\r\n\r\nBomba had no idea of the millions of rubber trees there must be in\r\nthe length and breadth of the Amazonian jungle. All he knew was that\r\nthe white men regarded them as precious. Very well then, he would\r\nguard these from fire until Gillis and Dorn should come to claim\r\nthem. It was good to be able to do something for these white men who\r\nhad been so good to him.\r\n\r\nSo to save the trees as well as his home, he toiled on with dogged\r\npersistence, while Casson watched him with feverish, half-wild eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time coming, but victory came at last. Half of the hut\r\nhad been torn or burned away and the last smoldering spark had been\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nTired, his brown skin scorched in a dozen places, the boy flung\r\nhimself down beside Casson, panting.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he said, his bright eyes full of triumph, “Bomba did not\r\nlet the fire touch the rubber trees.”\r\n\r\nCasson looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Rubber trees?” he repeated vaguely.\r\n\r\n“Back there,” said Bomba, with a wave of his hand. “White men want\r\nrubber trees. They hunt them with the caboclos. I save some for them.”\r\n\r\nThere was a boyish elation in his tone that penetrated even Casson’s\r\nbewildered senses. He put out a wavering hand to Bomba, and for the\r\nfirst time noticed how badly the boy was burned.\r\n\r\n“You will blister,” he said.\r\n\r\nBomba looked down indifferently at his bronzed skin.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he returned. “You are burned, too.”\r\n\r\nWithout further speech, he rose silently and disappeared in the\r\njungle. He reappeared a short time later, carrying handfuls of the\r\nriver mud. This he smeared thickly over Casson’s hands and face,\r\ntearing open the tattered shirt of the old naturalist to see if his\r\nchest was burned.\r\n\r\nThen he vanished again, to return with more mud which he spread over\r\nhis own burns. Then he sat down beside the old man for a few minutes\r\nof well-earned rest.\r\n\r\n“The hut is bad,” he said, after a few moments of contemplation. “It\r\nis almost half gone. I will fix it.”\r\n\r\nCody Casson made no reply.\r\n\r\nHe was a frail old man, bent with the weight of what seemed at least\r\nseventy years. He had a finely shaped head and features that must\r\nhave once been pleasing, though now deeply seamed with the wrinkles\r\nof exposure and hardship. His expression was kindly and benignant.\r\nHis eyes were blue and had once been clear and penetrating, though\r\nnow they had the bewildered vacuous look that comes to the half\r\ndemented.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there now he seemed to be puzzling over something.\r\nPresently he looked up at Bomba with an expression that the boy knew\r\nwell, having seen it there many times before.\r\n\r\nThe aged man was trying to remember, trying to recall something\r\nconcerning past events of his own life of which Bomba knew nothing.\r\n\r\n“You said”—Casson spoke slowly and painfully as though trying to\r\nforce his thoughts to keep pace with his words—“you said something\r\nabout—white men. You mean—what did you mean?”\r\n\r\nA curious shyness fell on Bomba. He could not tell Cody Casson all\r\nthat was in his mind concerning these white men, could not explain\r\nto him the vague but enchanting vistas this chance meeting with\r\nhis kind had opened up to him. How could he explain to another\r\nwhat he could hardly explain to himself? He was a creature of the\r\nwild, inarticulate, feeling the more deeply because he had no words\r\nadequate to express his thoughts.\r\n\r\nQuestioned now by Casson, he could give only the bare facts\r\nconcerning his encounter with the rubber hunters, how he had made his\r\nway to them following the report of the iron stick, how he had helped\r\nthem fight off the hungry jaguars, and how subsequently they had\r\npresented him with the harmonica, the matches, and the revolver.\r\n\r\nHe exhibited these treasures with great pride, and even played a few\r\nweird and mournful notes on the harmonica.\r\n\r\n“This,” he lifted the revolver carefully in one brown hand, “they\r\nsaid you would show me how to use. They told me something about it.\r\nIt is like your iron stick. It shoots blue fire and a thing they call\r\na cartridge. See, they gave me some of them,” and with face eager and\r\neyes glowing he brought forth the boxes of ammunition.\r\n\r\nCasson was staring at the jungle boy in a queer, half-fascinated way.\r\nBomba was frightened. He broke off in the midst of what he was saying\r\nand timidly touched the arm of the old man.\r\n\r\n“You are sick?” he asked anxiously. “I will go to the ygapo and bring\r\nback herbs.”\r\n\r\nHe was half-way to his feet when Casson’s nervous grip on his arm\r\nhalted him.\r\n\r\n“No, no! I am not sick!” he cried. “You are a white boy, as white as\r\nthose men are. You should not be living here, buried in the jungle.\r\nAll right for an old man, all right for—old—Casson.” The disjointed\r\nsentence wavered into silence.\r\n\r\nBomba regarded the old man eagerly, anxiously. In his heart a strange\r\nexcitement was throbbing. Was the door that at times had been partly\r\nopened to be swung wide at last? Was he to learn something about—what\r\nstrange words had the white men used?—“folks,” “relations”?\r\n\r\nThat he was white he had known for a long time and secretly exulted\r\nin it. But what did it mean to be white?\r\n\r\nPrimarily he knew that it referred to the color of the skin. His\r\nwas different from that of the caboclos that ranged the rivers,\r\ndifferent from that of the Indians who lived in the heart of the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nBut it must mean more than that. To be white meant not only to look\r\ndifferent, but to act differently, to think differently, to live\r\ndifferently. What inner thing was it that made those who wore white\r\nskin for a covering, like himself and Casson and Gillis and Dorn,\r\ndifferent from the brown or copper-skinned natives?\r\n\r\nIt was a problem too deep for Bomba, a problem that perplexed while\r\nit fascinated. Instinctively he knew that Cody Casson had the answer,\r\nor at least that he had possessed it in the days before the explosion\r\nof the fire stick.\r\n\r\nThe boy turned to the naturalist with a movement animal-like in its\r\nswiftness. He wanted to question him, to find out the truth, but he\r\ndid not know how to begin.\r\n\r\nBut Cody Casson, groping in his mind, spoke suddenly of his own\r\naccord.\r\n\r\n“I try to remember,” he muttered while Bomba bent closer to him,\r\nanxious to let not a word escape. “I try, but something closes like a\r\ndoor in my mind, locking me out, locking me out——”\r\n\r\nIt was pitiable to see him trying to goad his poor twisted brain\r\ninto action. Bomba sat as though carved in stone, fearing that any\r\nmovement on his part might hinder the revelation that seemed on the\r\nbrink of utterance.\r\n\r\nCasson began again, the words coming more quickly and with feverish\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n“It is for you I want to remember, Bomba; for you! I owe it to you.\r\nI am trying to think, trying—the door again—Bomba, help me to push\r\nback the door. There, I almost had it! Bartow—push, push hard,\r\nBomba—trying to remember—Laura, dear sweet Laura—Oh, I can’t! I\r\ncan’t! The door is shut. Gone—gone——”\r\n\r\nThe last word was a shriek.\r\n\r\nWith a groan of despair, Cody Casson turned over on his face, thin,\r\nveined hands outflung to clutch the jungle growth, his form convulsed\r\nwith a passion of sobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SHOUT OF WARNING\r\n\r\n\r\nThis emotional outbreak on the part of Casson disturbed and puzzled\r\nBomba.\r\n\r\nBefore it, he remained inarticulate, dumb, though there stirred in\r\nhim a great longing to comfort his companion. The white men, he\r\nthought, would have slapped him on the back and laughed and made him\r\nfeel better.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba could not do this. A strange embarrassment restrained him.\r\nSo he sat and looked at Casson and suffered with him and said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe storm was short-lived. Casson’s groping fingers unclenched, and a\r\nlong sigh shuddered through his frame.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, Bomba gently turned him over, and, gathering some fallen\r\nleaves, placed them as a cushion beneath Casson’s head.\r\n\r\n“You wait and rest here,” he ordered. “I will go and get some herbs.”\r\n\r\nThis time Casson made no objection to his going. He seemed exhausted,\r\napathetic. His poor bruised mind no longer strove for memory. It was\r\ndoubtful that he even knew Bomba had left him.\r\n\r\nThe lad returned after a while with a handful of herbs. Over these he\r\npoured some river water and set the pot upon a small heap made of a\r\nfew crossed sticks.\r\n\r\nBomba brought forth the precious supply of “fire sticks,” as he\r\nmentally named the matches Gillis and Dorn had given him, intending\r\nto light the fire with one of them.\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of great excitement he struck one upon a stone near\r\nby. This had been, while in the white men’s camp, an ever recurrent\r\nmiracle, the quick spurt of flame that followed the scratching of\r\nthis strange little stick along a rough surface.\r\n\r\nBut to his astonishment and utter chagrin the fire stick failed him.\r\nThere was no response to his quick stroke upon the rock.\r\n\r\nBomba sat back upon his heels and regarded the match with frowning\r\nattention. Here was something he could not understand. Under the\r\ndirection of the rubber-hunters, he had struck fire from the stick as\r\neasily as they had themselves. What then was the matter now?\r\n\r\nHe tried another match and then another, but when they still failed\r\nto give forth their magic fire, Bomba threw them from him with angry\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nWith a grunt of disgust he had recourse to his old standbys of bowl\r\nand stick, and soon had the fire going merrily.\r\n\r\nBomba was disturbed and worried by the incident. He could not know\r\nthat the matches had been ruined for the time during his swim in the\r\nrushing waters of the river. Neither Gillis nor Dorn had thought to\r\ntell him that water was bad for these queer fire sticks.\r\n\r\nSo Bomba reasoned that the fault must lie with him. He must have\r\nlost his cunning since he had left the white man’s camp. In a vague\r\nway he felt that he was sinking back again, back into that morass of\r\nignorance and loneliness from which his brief acquaintance with the\r\nwhite men had inspired him with the wish to raise himself.\r\n\r\nWas he white after all, except in the color of his skin? Had he not\r\nlived in the jungle too long to hope to escape to that other and\r\nmysterious one, so utterly different from the one in which he had\r\nbeen brought up? He was sure that Gillis or Dorn could have struck\r\nthat match. How far he was below them! Would he ever be able to stand\r\non a plane with them?\r\n\r\nBut he dismissed these gloomy forebodings and turned to the work\r\nat hand. The boiling herbs in the pot sent up a stifling, aromatic\r\nodor. Bomba had learned the secret of herb medicine from Candido, a\r\npoor half-witted caboclo who traveled from place to place living on\r\nturtles’ eggs and fish and such game as he could manage to bring down\r\nwith his arrows.\r\n\r\nCandido was the only native who had ever shown any friendliness\r\ntoward Bomba. He had told the boy the secret of the herb medicine,\r\nand had taught him where to search for the spindly little plant along\r\nthe river’s edge.\r\n\r\nSince then this primitive medicine had served as Bomba’s stock remedy\r\nfor all the ills of Casson and himself. It had remarkable healing and\r\ntonic qualities. Bomba had once taken it internally for snake bite,\r\nand since he had not died, believed implicitly ever afterward in the\r\npanacea of Candido, the half-witted caboclo.\r\n\r\nSo now, when it had acquired the proper consistency, he made a leaf\r\ncup and poured some of the steaming liquid into it. Lifting Casson\r\nto a sitting position, he put the primitive cup to his lips and\r\ncommanded that he drink.\r\n\r\n“You will feel good,” he declared, and Casson obediently swallowed\r\nthe dose.\r\n\r\nCasson shortly afterward seemed greatly revived. He insisted on\r\nsitting up, his back propped against a tree. From this vantage point\r\nhe watched Bomba as the boy prepared to clear away the ruins of the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe jungle boy worked hard and fast. It was no easy task to clear\r\naway the débris, much of it still hot and smouldering, and night was\r\ncoming on. Later he would rebuild the damaged side of the hut. For\r\nthe present it was sufficient that he arrange some sort of bed for\r\nCasson and build a fire that would keep the prowling beasts of the\r\nforest at a safe distance.\r\n\r\nWhile he worked, Bomba could feel the wistful eyes of Casson upon\r\nhim. He knew that the old naturalist was again groping, trying to\r\nswing open that “closed door” in his mind.\r\n\r\nThe work was done at last. Leaves and branches for a bed had been\r\ndragged within the hut. The fire was built far enough from the cabin\r\nnot to endanger it, but still close enough to warn off nocturnal\r\nmarauders.\r\n\r\nBomba went for water to the stream that flowed back of the dwelling,\r\nand, returning, set the pot once more upon the fire, this time to\r\nprepare the evening meal.\r\n\r\nThere was no food about the place, for Bomba had brought none back\r\nfrom his trip to the white man’s camp. He was about to go into\r\nthe forest, weary as he was, in search of some sort of game, when\r\nCasson’s faint voice called to him.\r\n\r\n“There are turtle eggs,” he said. “I found them this afternoon when\r\nI was watching the ciganas, those big brown birds with the splendid\r\ncrowns. They are there, the eggs, beyond that large flat stone.”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the cache where he had concealed the spoils of the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nGratefully, Bomba seized upon the eggs and plunged them into the\r\nboiling water. Turtle eggs were ever a luxury for the jungle-bred\r\npalate.\r\n\r\nWhen they were ready, Bomba brought them to Casson, and the two sat\r\ncross-legged upon the ground to eat the simple repast.\r\n\r\nBomba was tired and ravenous. He consumed several of the eggs in\r\njungle fashion by clipping off the tops and then squeezing the shell\r\nin both hands until yolk and white were forced through the opening.\r\nIt was some time before his appetite was sufficiently appeased to\r\npermit of conversation.\r\n\r\nThen he said to Casson:\r\n\r\n“Why did you stay inside the hut when it was in flames? If I had not\r\ncome just when I did, you would have been burned to death.”\r\n\r\nCasson nodded and passed a hand across his forehead in bewildered\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n“That is what puzzles me,” he said. “I had walked so far through the\r\njungle that I was very tired, and flung myself down to rest. I must\r\nhave fallen asleep, and when I woke the hut was full of smoke. I\r\nguessed what had happened at once, and tried to rise to make my way\r\nfrom the place. But there was no strength in me——”\r\n\r\n“The smoke made you blind?” suggested Bomba.\r\n\r\n“No.” Again that pitiful gesture of bewilderment. “My brain was\r\nclear. I was not dazed, as though from the smoke. It was weakness. I\r\ncould not move. I knew that unless you came and rescued me, I must\r\nlie there and be burned.”\r\n\r\nBomba pondered this, brow furrowed. He was greatly worried about\r\nCasson. The old man must be weaker than he had thought. Bomba must\r\ntake good care of him.\r\n\r\nAnd this led him to speak of the Indians, the thought of whom had\r\nbeen driven from his mind by the excitement of the fire.\r\n\r\n“It is not safe for you to go far into the jungle,” he warned the old\r\nman. “The head-hunters have come from the Giant Cataract. They will\r\nkill you if they find you when I am not there.”\r\n\r\nCasson shrugged his shoulders. He had long since ceased to regard his\r\nlife of great value.\r\n\r\n“I am not afraid,” he said simply.\r\n\r\n“But I am afraid for you,” said Bomba. “They have bad hearts. Some in\r\ntheir tribe have been sick and some have died. They say you do this.\r\nThey say if they kill you, their men and women will not be sick.”\r\n\r\nCasson smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n“They are foolish men,” he said. “I have never done harm to anyone.\r\nI would rather do them good if I could.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Bomba. “I said that to one of them. I told him you\r\nwere a brother, a good man. But he would not listen. The medicine man\r\nhas said that you must die.”\r\n\r\nStill Casson’s interest was only slight.\r\n\r\n“They are like children,” he replied. “They think one thing to-day\r\nand another thing to-morrow. Then, too, they come from far off, and\r\nthey do not know this part of the jungle. They might search for\r\nmonths and not find us.”\r\n\r\nSuch optimism made Bomba desperate. What could he do against the\r\nlistless indifference of one who cared but little whether he lived or\r\ndied?\r\n\r\n“They do not know where we are,” he admitted; “but the caboclos who\r\nlive here know. They may catch one of them and hurt him and tell him\r\nthey will kill him if he does not tell them where we live. Then he\r\nwill tell them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose he does?” sighed Casson wearily. “And suppose they\r\ncome? We will do our best. We can do no more. Maybe we can talk to\r\nthem and show them how foolish they are. If we have to fight, we will\r\ndo that. If they kill us we cannot help it.”\r\n\r\nBut this calm fatalism was by no means to Bomba’s liking. Life ran\r\nstrong in his veins, and he was determined to preserve it as long as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” he said. “I will make this house as strong as I can. I will\r\npile rocks against the walls. And there is the boat in the stream\r\nbehind the hut. If you hear them coming or see signs of them in the\r\njungle, get into the boat and row down the river. They will have no\r\nboats. And the river leaves no tracks. I will learn how to use the\r\nfire stick. It will frighten them, if they hear it. Maybe they will\r\nthink that we have magic and will go away.”\r\n\r\nThey were but slender props on which the boy leaned, but his stout\r\nheart did not quail at the odds against him. The life in the\r\njungle—the jungle itself—was always against him, but his quick\r\nwit and unfailing courage had brought him through so far, and he\r\ndauntlessly faced the future.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after this the man and the boy sat in silence. Casson\r\nwas wandering in some vague land of his own. Bomba kept repeating to\r\nhimself over and over the words that had fallen from the old man’s\r\nlips, “Bartow” and “Laura.”\r\n\r\nWhat had Casson meant? What had he been upon the point of telling?\r\n\r\nBomba did not know. But he was sure of one thing—that he would never\r\nforget those two words. Some day, perhaps, he would find out what\r\nthey meant. But how? Would that closed door in Casson’s mind open?\r\nWould the jungle boy have to search for the knowledge he craved in\r\nthe outside world—the world of the white men?\r\n\r\nBomba slept fitfully that night. Several times he was up to replenish\r\nthe fire. Only toward morning did he fall into a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\nHe was aroused at last by a cry from Casson—a cry of fear and horror.\r\n\r\nAnother shout, this time of warning, from the old man:\r\n\r\n“Bomba!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE VAMPIRES ATTACK\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba was awake instantly. He strove to rise, but fell back heavily.\r\nHis limbs seemed weighted with iron.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment another shrill cry from Casson reached him!\r\n\r\n“Vampires! The blood-sucking vampires! Quick, Bomba! Quick!”\r\n\r\nAs Bomba’s eyes accustomed themselves to the gloom of the hut they\r\ncaught sight of the horrid creature that had provoked Casson’s cry\r\nof warning—a blood-sucking vampire bat, as large as a hawk, with a\r\nspread of over two feet across the wings.\r\n\r\nTrue to its habits, it had attacked its victim while the latter\r\nwas sleeping. It had settled on Bomba’s feet and started to suck\r\nhis blood, while its great flapping wings kept up a gentle fanning\r\nmotion, designed to soothe the lad and keep him asleep as long as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBomba had been so exhausted from his exertions of the day before that\r\nthe bat’s task had been easy, and it had been able to prey on him\r\nfor a long time undisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn a flash Bomba knew what had happened to him. This, then, was the\r\nreason for that strange numbed feeling in his legs. Much of his blood\r\nmust have passed from him to the vampire to render him so weak.\r\n\r\nThe bat was still at his feet, draining him of the vital fluid,\r\nflapping, flapping those terrible wings with a lulling motion.\r\n\r\nA wild fury assailed Bomba, rage at his own impotence.\r\n\r\nWith a tremendous effort, he raised himself to a sitting posture and\r\nmoved his half-paralyzed legs.\r\n\r\nThe vampire left its perch on Bomba’s foot and flapped into the air a\r\nshort distance, its vicious, beady eyes fastened malignantly on the\r\nboy’s face. Bomba knew that the terrible creature, with the cunning\r\ninstinct of its kind, was aware of his weakness, and would not easily\r\nbe frightened off.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment there was another cry from Casson, and two other\r\nsinister shapes flapped their way into the half-ruined hut.\r\n\r\nBomba gave a hoarse cry, staggered to his feet and reached for the\r\nheavy club that he always kept close by his side when he slept. With\r\nthe other hand he grasped his machete and turned grimly to face the\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\nBut even as he turned, he staggered and almost fell. He was horribly\r\nweak. He could hardly hold the weapons. It was a gigantic effort even\r\nto lift them above his head.\r\n\r\nHe called to Casson, hoping for some help from the old man. But\r\nthe aged naturalist was sitting upright on his improvised couch of\r\nboughs and palm leaves, and his eyes were fixed with the bewildered,\r\nhalf-fascinated look of a frightened child upon the horrible winged\r\nintruders.\r\n\r\nBomba groaned. Lifting the machete with a tremendous effort—he had\r\nalready discarded the club, finding the weight of both weapons too\r\nmuch for him—he made a feeble advance upon the enemy.\r\n\r\nThere was a whirring of wings, and the hideous creatures swooped down\r\non him in a black, loathsome cloud.\r\n\r\nBomba gave way before the fury of the onslaught, striking at them\r\nwith the machete, while with the other arm he shielded his face from\r\nthe batting of those merciless wings.\r\n\r\nSensing his weakness, the bats became more bold and vicious. They\r\npressed upon him, striking him about the head and body. There was\r\na sharp pain in the arm that shielded his face, and Bomba felt a\r\ntrickle of blood run slowly down to his finger tips.\r\n\r\nHe lowered the shielding arm and shook the blood from his fingers. He\r\nwielded the machete again, and this time found a mark. But the blow\r\nwas weak, and far from seriously injuring his foe seemed only to have\r\nthe effect of further enraging it.\r\n\r\nThere was a second fierce attack, and beneath the flailing of wings\r\nBomba found himself borne to the floor.\r\n\r\nIn the fall the machete dropped from his hands.\r\n\r\nWeaponless! Helpless!\r\n\r\nIn a fury of impotence, Bomba beat at the bats with both fists. He\r\nstruck out wildly, blindly. But his wily enemies avoided the blows\r\nand pressed him the more viciously.\r\n\r\nBomba could not see that Casson had slipped from his bed and was\r\nstaggering to his feet. Even if he had, he would have felt but\r\nlittle hope. Before Casson in his enfeebled state could be of any\r\nassistance, Bomba’s need of help would be over.\r\n\r\nThe furious attack of his fists had kept the enemy at bay for only a\r\nfew seconds, and now Bomba was utterly exhausted. His muscles refused\r\nto obey the commands of his will. His hands fell limp, and again the\r\nvampires settled upon him.\r\n\r\nThe arms with which he tried to protect his face were bitten a\r\nscore of times. Blood welled from the wounds. One of the vampires\r\nhad settled upon his chest. Its weight seemed to be crushing Bomba,\r\nsmothering him. The next moment he expected it to be at his throat.\r\n\r\nWith a hoarse cry he threw out one arm. His fingers touched something\r\ncold and hard. The revolver, the gift of the white men!\r\n\r\nWhat was it that thrilled Bomba as his fingers closed upon the barrel\r\nof the weapon? What meant the excitement that coursed through his\r\nweakened body as his finger felt the trigger? A feeling inherited\r\nfrom generations of white ancestors; the sensation of almost\r\nlimitless power that the touch of a firearm brings to its possessor?\r\n\r\nWith all his remaining strength Bomba called for Casson to get out of\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n“Fire stick! Shoot!” he cried, and Casson, understanding, backed into\r\na far corner of the hut.\r\n\r\nBomba’s arm was throbbing and paining. He was bruised and beaten by\r\nthose powerful wings. He felt as though almost the last ounce of\r\nstrength had been drained from him. That sensation of overpowering\r\nweakness warned him that he must act quickly if he were to act at all.\r\n\r\nSlowly he lifted the revolver and pressed it against the body of the\r\nbat that rested on his breast.\r\n\r\nThe boy shut his eyes, held his breath, and pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nThere was a loud report, a curiously throttled squawk close to his\r\near, and what had been a vampire bat was now but a gory mass huddled\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the shot had frightened the other two marauders, and\r\nthey hovered about fanning the air with their great wings, manifestly\r\nuncertain whether to return to the attack or take refuge in flight.\r\n\r\nRelieved of the weight of them, Bomba raised himself unsteadily on\r\nhis left elbow and again lifted the magic gift of the white men.\r\n\r\nDespite his fatigue, his weakness from loss of blood, Bomba was\r\nfiercely exultant. He had done with this wonderful weapon what he had\r\nfailed to do with the club and the machete.\r\n\r\nBut there was small time allowed him for jubilation. The vampires,\r\nthe first moment of panic passed, evidently resolved not to let their\r\nprey escape them and again returned viciously to the attack.\r\n\r\nThis time Bomba was ready for them.\r\n\r\nCasson, watching from the remote corner of the hut, saw the boy\r\nslowly lift the weapon. Bomba waited until the first of the\r\nassailants was almost upon him. He was by no means sure of his skill\r\nwith this death-dealing weapon, and he meant to take no chances of\r\nthe bullet going wild.\r\n\r\nThere came a second report, another wild flapping of wings, and he\r\nhad lessened the odds against him by half. But the remaining vampire\r\nkept on straight for Bomba’s head.\r\n\r\nBomba pulled the trigger again, but only an ominous click answered\r\nhim. Twice he tried again desperately, and with the same result.\r\n\r\nAnd now the vampire was fairly upon him.\r\n\r\nActing purely on instinct, Bomba shifted the revolver in his hand,\r\nand with the butt end of it struck at his enemy. He hit the bat full\r\non its ugly head, and it fell stunned to the floor.\r\n\r\nBomba did not know whether it was dead or not. But he meant to make\r\ncertain, and he struck at the bat again and again until it was a mass\r\nof pulp.\r\n\r\nThe battle was over. It had been like a struggle in a nightmare. In\r\nevery other fight in which he had ever engaged he had been in the\r\nfull possession of his senses. His courage, his agility, his strength\r\nhad been at his command. But in this fearful combat the loss of blood\r\nbefore he awoke and the resultant physical weakness had put him under\r\na terrible handicap.\r\n\r\nBut the soul of him had not failed. His indomitable fighting spirit\r\nhad brought him through a victor.\r\n\r\nHe lay there panting, and it was some time before he could struggle\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\nHe shoved the carcasses of the vampires from him with a disgusted\r\ngrunt. Then he balanced the revolver in his hand and stared at it\r\nwith a strange gleam in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I am like the white men now,” he said to Casson, as the latter\r\ncrawled over to him. “I can use the fire stick!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nKIKI, WOOWOO AND DOTO\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba’s exultation subsided somewhat when he recalled the fact that\r\nthe much-prized weapon had failed to work the last time he had pulled\r\nthe trigger.\r\n\r\n“It is broken and there are no white men here to give me another,” he\r\ngroaned.\r\n\r\nCasson took it in his shaking fingers and examined it. Long years\r\nbefore he had been an expert shot with both rifle and revolver and\r\nwas thoroughly familiar with their mechanisms.\r\n\r\nHe broke the stock and examined the chambers.\r\n\r\n“This is what is the trouble,” he said, as he saw that the chambers\r\nwere empty. “It can’t shoot if there’s nothing in there to shoot. You\r\ndidn’t have it fully loaded.”\r\n\r\n“But it was loaded when I left the white man’s camp!” Bomba replied.\r\nThen he remembered that he had been tempted to try his marksmanship\r\non a tree the day before and had thus disposed of three of his\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\nHis relief was great at this solution of the mystery, and he reloaded\r\nthe weapon forthwith, mentally recording a vow that never again would\r\nhe go to sleep or sally forth into the jungle without the revolver\r\ncontaining the full five missiles, any one of which might spell the\r\ndifference between life and death.\r\n\r\nA sudden thought occurred to him as he shoved the bodies of the\r\nvampires out of the door.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps one of them had been here before,” he said to Casson, “and\r\nthat is what made him come back with others to-night.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think that?” asked the old man, looking at him with\r\nsome surprise.\r\n\r\n“Because you were so weak when I found you in the hut,” replied\r\nBomba. “The bat may have been sucking your blood when you lay asleep.\r\nThen the fire came and the smoke frightened the bat away. But he had\r\ntaken so much of your blood that you had no strength left to get\r\noutside the door.”\r\n\r\n“I hadn’t thought of that; but it may be so,” replied Casson. “I know\r\nI never felt so weak before. I felt as if I could not move hand or\r\nfoot. And perhaps that is the reason I could not help you to-night.\r\nI wanted to. I tried to. I would have given my life to get to your\r\nside. But I could not.”\r\n\r\nThough he could hardly drag one foot after the other, Bomba went to\r\nthe stream back of the hut and washed his wounds thoroughly. Then he\r\ngot out a salve that had great soothing and curative qualities and\r\napplied it on every place where he had been bitten. This done, he\r\nfell rather than lay down, and reclined there utterly exhausted till\r\nthe break of day.\r\n\r\nIt was now that his vitality and perfect physical condition stood him\r\nin good stead. Had he been less hardy he might have succumbed, owing\r\nto his great loss of blood.\r\n\r\nEven as it was, it took several days to restore him to his usual\r\ncondition. His hunting and fishing had to be given up for a time, as\r\nhe did not dare to venture into the jungle.\r\n\r\nAs he grew a little stronger, he busied himself in the rebuilding of\r\nthe ruined portion of the hut.\r\n\r\nThe hut, in which they had lived for years, was simple in the\r\nextreme, though compared to some of the abodes of the half-breeds and\r\nthe primitive shelters of the Indians, it was almost palatial.\r\n\r\nIt had been totally enclosed on all four sides, except for the small\r\nopening of the doorway, which let in light and air, whereas many of\r\nthe huts of the caboclos had only roofs for coverings and were open\r\non all four sides to the vicious fury of tropical storms. Those of\r\nthe natives, deep in the heart of the jungle, were still more simple,\r\nconsisting usually of cotton hammocks swung between two trees and a\r\ncouple of giant palm leaves meeting above for a covering.\r\n\r\nThere was a wood flooring, laid by Casson years ago, that served to\r\nkeep out scorpions and the snakes that made their home in the ygapo.\r\nIt had contained two hammocks, which had been destroyed in the fire,\r\nsome old boxes with markings on them that had become illegible from\r\ntime, a chest in which Casson had stored his precious specimens of\r\nbutterflies and flowers, some scientific books, a few old rusted\r\ncooking utensils, and some bits of nicked and broken crockery.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the inmates of the hut was as primitive as their\r\nfurniture. Casson wore an old patched pair of trousers and a ragged\r\ncotton shirt, which he washed now and then in the river at the back.\r\nBut Bomba, child of the jungle, preferred the dress of the Indians,\r\nthe mundiyeh, or short tunic of native cloth, with the addition of\r\nthe puma skin which helped to keep him warm when he was compelled to\r\nsleep out at night.\r\n\r\nBomba worked steadily at the reconstruction of the hut, which he\r\nwas determined to make stronger than it had been before, in order\r\nthat it might serve as a fort in case they should be attacked by\r\nthe head-hunters. He used timbers of lignum vitæ, the toughest and\r\nstrongest wood of the Amazon jungle. Then he stopped up all the\r\ncrevices with mud, that under the fierce sun soon assumed the\r\nconsistency of stone. He wound everything about with stout bush cord,\r\nand completed his work by piling mud and stones against the lower\r\npart of all four walls.\r\n\r\nAnd always while he worked Bomba pondered the words that had fallen\r\nfrom Casson’s lips when he had heard of the visit of Bomba to the\r\ncamp of the white men.\r\n\r\n“Bartow.” “Laura.” He repeated them to himself perhaps a thousand\r\ntimes. What did they mean? What bearing, if any, did they have on his\r\nown life and destiny?\r\n\r\nSeveral times he was on the point of asking Casson for an\r\nexplanation. But he remembered the terrible paroxysm into which\r\nCasson had been thrown the last time he had uttered those words.\r\nBomba was afraid to precipitate another such scene. It might kill\r\nCasson. He loved the old man, clung to him. He would not endanger his\r\nlife by probing him with any further questions.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the work on the hut was finished. Bomba was proud of\r\nhis craftsmanship, and even Casson roused himself from his apathy far\r\nenough to bestow some words of praise.\r\n\r\nBut now that his task was done and his strength fully recovered, a\r\ngreat restlessness took possession of Bomba. Casson, a mere shadow\r\nof a man, going for hours without speaking a word, responding to\r\nquestions only in monosyllables, was no companion for the lad.\r\n\r\nBomba longed to be off to the shadowy depths of the jungle. He had\r\nenemies there, but he also had friends. He would call these friends\r\nto him, Kiki and Woowoo, Doto, the giant monkey, and Tatuc, head of\r\nthe monkey tribe.\r\n\r\nThey were the warmest friends he had in that vast tangled wilderness\r\nbesides Casson. He understood them, and they loved and trusted him.\r\nHe was scarcely ever lonesome when with them.\r\n\r\nIt was very bad to be lonesome. That ache was more terrible to Bomba\r\nthan any tearing of his flesh. He shrank from it as he did from no\r\nphysical pain. It was really the poignant longing in him for his own\r\nkind, but Bomba knew it only as a strange illness, an ache not of his\r\nbody but of some mysterious part of him of which he had no knowledge.\r\n\r\nSo now, feeling this sickness creeping over him, he felt irresistibly\r\nthe impulse to fly from it, to seek forgetfulness among the only\r\nfriends he knew.\r\n\r\nThe jungle boy determined to take his harmonica, too. His eyes\r\nbrightened at the thought. He had now learned to make the instrument\r\nemit the sounds he, Bomba, wished. Perhaps the monkeys and parrots\r\nwould like it. At least they would be surprised and inquisitive.\r\n\r\nBomba had two good reasons to give Casson for his trip. They needed\r\ngame. They had been living almost altogether upon the eggs of the\r\njaboties, or forest turtles, and even to a jungle palate, easily\r\nsatisfied, such a limited diet becomes monotonous, if too long\r\ncontinued. Then, too, he wanted to get in contact with some of the\r\nmore friendly natives and secure from them a couple of hammocks to\r\nreplace those that had been destroyed in the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen he announced his intention to Casson, the old man merely nodded\r\nin an absent manner and went on with what he was doing. So Bomba\r\ntook his machete, his bow and arrows, his precious fire stick and\r\nhis harmonica, and plunged into the jungle, not without repeated\r\ninjunctions to Casson to be on the alert if the head-hunters should\r\ncome, and, if he had time, to try to escape down the river.\r\n\r\nBomba had not gone far before he began to see among the trees and in\r\nthe branches the faces of his wild friends peering at him with their\r\nbright eyes.\r\n\r\nHe called to them softly, and they came to him. Kiki and Woowoo, the\r\nparrots, perched on his shoulders and pecked affectionately at his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nDoto, the great monkey, swung from branch to branch close above his\r\nhead, now and again playfully dropping a bunch of leaves upon him.\r\nBomba felt soothed and comforted.\r\n\r\nThese wild folk loved and trusted him. He was one of them. He\r\nbelonged here in the heart of the jungle. It must be so.\r\n\r\nYet all the time some mysterious voice within him whispered that it\r\nwas not so. He did not belong here. He was no caboclo, no Indian.\r\nWhat was he then? Where did he belong?\r\n\r\nBartow! Laura! He felt that in these words must lie the solution of\r\nthe enigma. Over and over the words ran through his mind, until it\r\nseemed that even the chattering monkeys overhead must hear them.\r\n\r\nFeeling the loneliness again creeping over him, Bomba sat down on a\r\nlog and took out his mouth organ. He would gather his friends around\r\nhim. They would help him to fight off the sickness that came from\r\nnowhere and did not hurt his body—hurt only that mysterious part of\r\nhim that he did not understand.\r\n\r\nBut the first weird notes on the harmonica had a queer effect upon\r\nthe jungle denizens. They had begun to cluster about the boy, as\r\nthey always did when he appeared among them. But at the wail of the\r\ncurious thing that Bomba held to his mouth they disappeared. If they\r\nhad suddenly been sucked down to the muddy bottom of the ygapo, the\r\nplace could not have seemed more utterly deserted.\r\n\r\nBomba looked surprised for a moment. Then he smiled, his teeth\r\nshowing dazzling white against his brown skin.\r\n\r\nHe whistled softly and called:\r\n\r\n“Doto! Doto! Where are you?”\r\n\r\nThere was a slight rustling of leaves in a tree near by, and Doto\r\npeered cautiously through the branches. His brow was wrinkled in a\r\nscowl that seemed to say he was not at all sure that Bomba was not\r\nplaying some practical joke on him.\r\n\r\n“Look! Nice music! Not hurt Doto!”\r\n\r\nBomba held his mouth organ out to the big monkey, so that he might\r\nget a better look at it.\r\n\r\n“Nice music,” said Bomba again. “Listen!”\r\n\r\nOnce more he put the harmonica to his lips and blew a plaintive wail\r\ninto the reaches of the jungle.\r\n\r\nA response came that was as startling as it was unexpected.\r\n\r\nThere was a thunderous roar, a crashing of the undergrowth, and a\r\ngreat jaguar bounded into view!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPLAYING FOR HIS LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment Bomba was so taken aback by the sight of the jaguar that\r\nhe did not stir.\r\n\r\nHis harmonica was still between his lips, and the sudden exclamation\r\nthat was forced from him droned through the mouth organ in a weird,\r\ndiscordant note.\r\n\r\nThe wailing cry had a strange and instant effect upon the beast. It\r\nhad crouched as though for a spring, but now it hesitated. It had\r\nnever seen a human with a gleaming mouth like that. It had never\r\nheard that kind of sound. The jungle beast is a creature of habit.\r\nAnything new is disconcerting.\r\n\r\nBomba noted instantly the effect, and took advantage of it. He could\r\nsee that the beast was bewildered and a bit daunted. He wished, if\r\npossible, to avoid a physical contest with the huge creature at such\r\nclose quarters.\r\n\r\nSo, while his right hand stole slowly to the revolver in his belt, he\r\nmaintained the harmonica at his mouth with his left and launched into\r\na refrain that had no melody but which was a mere mass of discordant\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nThe tense attitude of the jaguar relaxed and he settled down on his\r\nhaunches, his greenish-yellow eyes fastened on Bomba, who in turn\r\nstared at him with equal intensity.\r\n\r\nThe boy was vibrating with excitement, but he let no sign of this\r\nappear. Everything depended on his keeping his nerve. The beast was\r\nevidently uncertain what to do.\r\n\r\nAs Bomba played on, there flashed through his mind a story that\r\nCasson had told him in a moment of expansion, a story of the\r\nsnake charmers in a faraway land of which Bomba had forgotten the\r\nname. Casson had said that when these men had played on a musical\r\ninstrument, fierce and poisonous snakes had become as mild and\r\nharmless as rabbits and had submitted to be handled without a thought\r\nof resistance.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, a jaguar was not a snake, but might not the same rule\r\napply? He had already seen that he had laid a sort of spell on the\r\ncreature. How long would it last?\r\n\r\nIn any event, he had his knife and the revolver as last resorts. And\r\nso he kept on playing. He did not know how long he could keep it up;\r\nbut he was committed to the test. Perhaps he was playing for his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nOne thing he was quick to notice. When he played softly, the jaguar\r\nshowed evidence of pleasure. Its muscles seemed to relax, and had it\r\nnot been for the noise he was making Bomba was sure he could have\r\nheard it purr.\r\n\r\nBut when the notes swelled out more sharply the brute moved\r\nrestlessly and whined. It shook its head, as though to shake the\r\nnoise from its ears. The strain jarred upon it, hurt it.\r\n\r\nBomba hardly knew how to interpret this. Would the louder notes stir\r\nthe beast to anger and attack? Or would it create in it such pain and\r\ndiscomfort that it would seek refuge in retreat?\r\n\r\nOn the mere chance of the latter solution, he abandoned the softer\r\nstrain altogether and blew with all his might. He was risking\r\neverything on a single cast.\r\n\r\nThe answer was not long in coming. The look that came into the\r\njaguar’s eyes was not of rage but of confusion and distress. It\r\nscrambled to its feet, looked about uncertainly for a moment, and\r\nthen turned tail and slunk off into the jungle.\r\n\r\nBomba kept on playing until he was sure that the brute was far away.\r\nThen the reaction came on him, and he sank down on the ground, weak\r\nand limp and covered with perspiration.\r\n\r\nWith his immense relief was mingled a new sense of gratitude to the\r\nwhite men. Twice now their gifts had saved his life. Was there any\r\nlimit to their magic?\r\n\r\nHe did not know that the white men themselves would have been\r\nastounded at this application of their musical gift. All the jungle\r\nlad looked at was the result. It was another link that bound him to\r\nthe men who seemed in some vague way to bind Bomba’s destiny to the\r\nrace to which he belonged.\r\n\r\nHe was aroused from his reflections by a squeak from the branches\r\nabove, and, looking up, he saw the face of Doto, who had disappeared\r\nlike a flash at the entrance of the jaguar upon the scene and had now\r\nventured back.\r\n\r\nWith a glint of mischief in his eyes, Bomba blew a few notes on the\r\nharmonica. Again Doto darted back, but not with such alarm as before.\r\n\r\nWhen the monkey’s face again looked through the branches, Bomba\r\nmanaged to coax him nearer and nearer until at last he dropped from\r\nthe lowest branch and squatted close to the boy on the ground.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this show of daring on the part of one of their number,\r\nthe others began to return, peering cautiously at first and from a\r\ndistance, but coming closer as their curiosity drove them on.\r\n\r\nAt last, when he had played them all back to him and Woowoo and Kiki\r\nwere once more perched trustingly on his shoulders, Bomba passed the\r\nmouth organ to Doto.\r\n\r\nDoto took it hesitantly, drawing back his hands several times before\r\nhis long fingers closed firmly on the strange toy. The excited\r\nchattering of the monkeys mingled with the raucous notes of the\r\nparrots as they flaunted their gorgeous plumage about the boy’s head.\r\n\r\nDoto regarded the strange instrument with a good deal of\r\nconcentration. He was not at all sure that he liked it. It took\r\nBomba some time to persuade him to put it to his lips. Then by\r\nexpelling his breath sharply several times he finally made the monkey\r\nunderstand that he wanted him to blow on it.\r\n\r\nOne horrible squawk issued from the harmonica. Then Doto dropped it\r\non the ground like a shot and scuttled in panic to the nearest tree.\r\n\r\nSome of the more timid among the flock followed him, but most of them\r\nremained with Bomba. One young monkey, bolder than the rest, picked\r\nup the instrument.\r\n\r\nInstantly Doto dropped from the tree, chattering angrily. He boxed\r\nthe ears of the young monkey soundly and snatched the harmonica from\r\nhim. He handled the plaything gingerly and held it out to Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe boy showed his white teeth in an amused smile and took back the\r\ninstrument. Doto did not want it, but he was going to make sure that\r\nno other monkey got it!\r\n\r\nIt was good to be here in the jungle with his friends. Bomba would\r\nhave been glad to stay longer, but there was still much for him to do\r\nand he must not leave Casson too long alone.\r\n\r\nSo reluctantly he said good-bye to them, though they besought him in\r\ntheir way to stay, and set off toward the ygapo.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely started when there arose such an excited tumult in\r\nthe trees that he knew something out of the ordinary had happened or\r\nwas about to happen.\r\n\r\nHe seized a low-lying branch and swung himself into a tree.\r\n\r\nThe screeching and howling increased in volume, and through the\r\nfoliage of the trees Bomba could see a veritable swarm of monkeys\r\napproaching him. They swung from branch to branch in frantic haste,\r\nhowling with rage and fear.\r\n\r\nThey were in trouble! They were coming to him for help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE CLOUD OF VULTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba dropped to the ground and waited.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the monkeys were upon him, dropping from the branches and\r\nsurrounding him, crowding against him, howling and jabbering all at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nBomba drew one red-faced old ape aside. It was the leader of the\r\nswarm.\r\n\r\n“Tatuc, ba?” asked Bomba, meaning in monkey language, “Tatuc, what is\r\nwrong?”\r\n\r\nIn the jabbering monosyllable chatter, which Bomba from years of\r\nintimacy and observation had come to understand sufficiently to get\r\nits essential meaning, Tatuc gave the boy the news that his flock had\r\nbeen attacked by a swarm of vultures while trying to defend two of\r\ntheir young that the voracious birds had swooped down upon, with the\r\nintention of carrying them off to their retreats, where they could\r\ndevour them at leisure.\r\n\r\nThe resistance had infuriated the birds, who were coming in numbers.\r\nAnd the monkeys, timid folk at best except when they were cornered,\r\nhad come to Bomba for help.\r\n\r\nEven as Bomba gathered this from Tatuc’s chattering, a sinister\r\nwhirring of wings sounded and a cloud of the birds of prey swept down\r\nthrough and under the trees.\r\n\r\nExcept when attacked or thwarted of their prey, the vultures rarely\r\nattack living creatures, preferring to feast in safety and at leisure\r\nupon carrion.\r\n\r\nBut when the latter is scarce, they do not hesitate to swoop down\r\nupon lambs or other small game and carry them off. In this instance\r\nthe young monkeys had been tempting bait, and the attempt of the\r\nmothers to defend their offspring had aroused the ferocity of the\r\nvultures, never far from the surface, and had prompted this wholesale\r\nraid in reprisal.\r\n\r\nAgainst these creatures the monkeys had little defense. They could\r\nonly fly from them, and quick as they were, the wings of the great\r\nbirds were swifter.\r\n\r\nNow the monkeys crowded close to Bomba, chattering and howling,\r\nbegging for his protection. He had power. Had they not seen the\r\njaguar slink away from him? Why should he not also disperse the\r\nvultures?\r\n\r\nAs the black pursuing crowd of vultures came closer, Bomba reached\r\nfor the revolver, balancing it in his strong brown fingers. The\r\nexpression of his mouth was grim, but in his heart was already coming\r\nthe delight of battle.\r\n\r\nAgain that feeling of power swept over him. In all his contests with\r\nbird or beast or reptile of the jungle he had never faced them with\r\nsuch a sense of mastery as now. The revolver, gift of the white men,\r\nmade all the difference—that deadly little toy from the mouth of\r\nwhich spurted fire and death.\r\n\r\nAs the ominous cloud swept closer, thickening overhead, Bomba set his\r\nsturdy brown legs wide apart and fired into the midst of it.\r\n\r\nThe friendly monkeys at first were more scared by the report than by\r\nthe attacking vultures. They shrank away from Bomba, screaming more\r\nwildly than before. What had happened? Was their best friend turning\r\nagainst them?\r\n\r\nBut Bomba shouted to them reassuringly and again shot into the swarm\r\nof vultures.\r\n\r\nTwo of them fell with a great flapping of wings into the underbrush,\r\nwhile a third, one wing drooping, blundered off through the trees.\r\n\r\nThe attack was halted. Bewildered by the noise of the shots and the\r\nspurts of flame, as well as by the fall of some of their number, the\r\ngreat birds fluttered about uncertainly, beating the air with their\r\nwings and filling the air with raucous squawks.\r\n\r\nThe respite, however, was only temporary. The assailants swooped down\r\nagain, with wicked claws outstretched and cruel curved beaks ready\r\nfor action.\r\n\r\nOne of them darted forward and seized a baby monkey, tearing it\r\nfrom the mother’s arms. A long agonized howl came from the bereaved\r\nfemale. She sprang into the air and clutched wildly at the tiny\r\nhelpless bundle in the claws of the vulture.\r\n\r\nThe great wide-spread wings of the attackers were so close that Bomba\r\nwas fanned by them. He shielded his eyes instinctively with one arm\r\nagainst the rip of beak and claw. With the other hand he slowly\r\nraised the revolver, trained it upon the vulture with the baby monkey\r\nin its talons, tightened his finger on the trigger and fired.\r\n\r\nThe shot struck no vital part, because Bomba had feared to injure the\r\nlittle captive. But he succeeded in breaking the wing of the vulture.\r\nWith a shrill squeak it dropped its prey, and with its uninjured wing\r\nflapping clumsily, disappeared above the trees.\r\n\r\nThe mother monkey leaped forward, seized her baby, hugged it to her\r\nbreast and crouched low above it, interposing her body between it and\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe vultures returned to the attack with redoubled fury. The\r\nopposition they encountered served only to enrage them the more. They\r\ncame in smothering masses, and there ensued a fight that Bomba never\r\nforgot.\r\n\r\nThe monkeys, brought to bay, fought viciously for their lives. But\r\nwithout the aid of Bomba the odds would have been too much for them.\r\nAnd even the boy, armed with his new death-dealing weapon, had need\r\nof all his strength and agility to withstand the attack of the\r\npredatory birds.\r\n\r\nHe fought them off as well as he could, wielding his machete with his\r\nleft hand, shooting when he could, carpeting the ground about him\r\nwith dead or wounded birds.\r\n\r\nBut always they came on. There seemed no end of them. His flesh was\r\nscratched and torn in a dozen places where powerful wing or beak had\r\nraked him.\r\n\r\nA hurried glance told him that his friends, the monkeys were\r\nsuffering horribly. The dead were piled in heaps. Several vultures\r\nhad seized upon living prey and were making their way toward their\r\nhome fastnesses.\r\n\r\nRaging, Bomba continued to shoot until the cartridges in the weapon\r\nwere exhausted and the ominous click without a report told him the\r\nfire stick needed reloading. He dared not take time for this.\r\n\r\nBut he still had his bow and arrows and he dropped the revolver and\r\nmachete and had recourse to those primitive weapons.\r\n\r\nPrimitive they might be, but in his hands they were deadly. Every\r\ntime his bow twanged the arrow found its mark. At such close quarters\r\nthe missile went clear through the body of his target, protruding\r\nfrom the farther side.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of the boy that he never thought of flight.\r\nAt any moment he could have found refuge in one of the many dense\r\nthickets of the vicinity that no bird could penetrate. There he could\r\nhave waited in perfect security until the fight was over and the\r\nraiders had dispersed.\r\n\r\nBut an ingrained sense of loyalty to his tree-living friends made\r\neven the thought impossible. They had come to him. They were fighting\r\nagainst terrible odds. They relied on him to help them. Would he\r\ndesert them in their extremity, forfeit the confidence they had in\r\nhim? Not while breath remained in his body.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though that breath were not going to remain very much\r\nlonger. He could scarcely draw air into his bursting lungs. His chest\r\nseemed bound with iron bands. His strength was deserting him. He was\r\nfairly trembling with fatigue.\r\n\r\nBut his indomitable will was as strong as ever. He had a wild\r\nBerserker rage against these fiendish, ferocious enemies from the\r\nair, these pirates of the ether. For every wound he got from beak or\r\ntalon he was determined to exact a death in return.\r\n\r\nBut his arrows would soon be gone. Then it would come to a\r\nhand-to-hand fight with the machete. But that weapon was only\r\neffective when wielded by a strong hand. He might strike with it,\r\nwound with it, but in his present wearied state he could not kill.\r\nAnd when it should drop from his paralyzed hand—But Bomba would not\r\nallow himself to think of what would happen after that.\r\n\r\nNow his last arrow was really gone, and the vultures seemed more\r\nnumerous than ever. Reinforcements had come to their depleted ranks.\r\n\r\nBomba stooped over and picked up his machete. But to his dismay he\r\nfound that he could not lift it above his head. His numbed muscles\r\nhad rebelled at last and refused to obey his will.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, mysteriously, the heavy cloud lifted. Bomba heard the\r\nwhirring of wings in retreat. He looked up. The vultures had gathered\r\nas though in obedience to a signal and were winging their way above\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the jungle boy did not know what to make of the sudden\r\nflight of his enemies. From his place on the ground he could not\r\nknow what had startled the vultures.\r\n\r\nThen he heard the cries and whimperings of the monkeys.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Bomba heard the rushing of wind through the jungle.\r\nIt came with a roar like that of surf pounding upon the shore.\r\n\r\n“The great wind!” cried Bomba, and raised his bleeding arms toward\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE WRATH OF THE STORM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great wind, the forerunner of the tropical thunderstorm, had come\r\nat the moment of Bomba’s greatest need.\r\n\r\nAll creatures of the jungle fly to shelter before the fury of the\r\nstorm. Bomba knew this full well, as did all living creatures of\r\nthese wilds, large and small.\r\n\r\nAt the first blast of that fierce gale the parrakeets flew screaming\r\nto shelter. The animals of the forests rushed for their dens and the\r\nearth dwellers scurried into their holes.\r\n\r\nEven the savage vultures retreated before the onset of the gale and\r\nthe rain of castanha nuts shaken from the bending trees. Broken wings\r\nand broken heads would have resulted from the downfall of those\r\ndreaded missiles, heavy enough with their cups to kill a man.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the vultures winged upward in retreat before a second\r\nand stronger rush of wind warned Bomba and the group of bleeding and\r\nmourning monkeys, in whose behalf he had fought so stoutly, that the\r\nstorm was preparing to burst.\r\n\r\nSome of the monkeys had lost their young, others their mates. What\r\naffected Bomba most was the sight of old Tatuc lying dead on the\r\nground in a pool of blood, his teeth imbedded in the neck of the\r\nvulture that he had taken to death with him.\r\n\r\nBut there was no time for mourning now. Tragedies like these were\r\ncommon in the cruel jungle where the life of one thrived on the death\r\nof others. So while a bitter ache shot through Bomba at the loss of\r\nTatuc, his best and oldest friend of the monkey tribe, he dared not\r\nlinger in the spot.\r\n\r\nHe gave a sharp word of command to the monkeys, dazed by the loss of\r\ntheir chief, and bade them seek shelter in the upper branches of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThey obeyed slowly, bewilderedly, scarcely seeming to care much what\r\nhappened to them, leaving their dead behind them on the ground. They\r\nwould furnish a fine feast for the hungry vultures when they returned\r\nto the battlefield, as Bomba knew they would when the storm had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba could not bear to leave Tatuc there at the mercy of his\r\nfoes. It revolted him to think that the vultures should have him. He\r\nhad been unable to save his life, but something prompted him to one\r\nlast act of affection for his old friend. So he picked up the body,\r\nthrew it over his shoulder and as rapidly as he could made his way to\r\na safer place.\r\n\r\nIt was high time. The trees were bending before the lashing of the\r\nwind. The heavy castanha nuts were already beginning to fall with\r\nheavy thuds upon the ground. The sky above the waving crests of the\r\ntrees showed a weird, leaden gray. The storm was ready to burst.\r\n\r\nBomba had scarcely taken a dozen steps carrying his heavy burden when\r\nthe tempest broke. The rain came down in a stinging, blinding deluge\r\nthat scourged him as though with whips. The wind increased to a gale,\r\nwhich, luckily, was at his back. No living thing could have faced it\r\nwithout being swept from its feet.\r\n\r\nBomba was swept along almost without his own volition. Head down,\r\nwith the dead body of Tatuc held close to his own, he progressed more\r\nby the sense of touch than sight, heading toward a deserted native\r\nhut that he knew lay at a little distance.\r\n\r\nThe lightning cut the black of the sky with vicious thrusts. Crash\r\nafter crash of thunder seemed to shake the very ground beneath\r\nthe lad’s feet. But he reached the hut at last, and, climbing the\r\nprostrate deep-notched tree trunk that led to its entrance, slippery\r\nnow with the rain, he deposited his lifeless burden on the floor,\r\ncomposed of a few rotting boards.\r\n\r\nIt was a typical native hut of the jungle. Long ago it had been\r\ndeserted by its one-time tenants. It consisted of a few upright poles\r\nset in the ground, with cross supports to hold them steady. The\r\nflooring was made of split pieces of palm trunks, sagging in places.\r\n\r\nThe walls had been made of the same material, but now only two sides\r\nwere left standing, the others being open to the assault of wind and\r\nweather. A light framework of thinner saplings supported the flimsy\r\nroof. This was made of the leaves of the ubussu palm, placed so that\r\nthey overlapped one another.\r\n\r\nHundreds of creeping insects crawled slimily beneath the roof and\r\nnow and then dropped upon the shoulders and head of Bomba, as he sat\r\nhunched up and brooding beside the body of the dead monkey, Tatuc,\r\nleader of the flock.\r\n\r\nOnce it was a scorpion that fell on the lad, and he was forced to act\r\nquickly to kill the creature, before it could inject into his veins\r\nthe deadly poison of its bite.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Bomba sat brooding beside his dead companion. The\r\nrain swept down in torrents. The lightning crashed and the thunder\r\nroared and all nature was in pandemonium.\r\n\r\nBut the storms of the jungle, fierce while they last, are seldom\r\nof long duration. When at last the rain ceased and the last\r\nreverberating peal of thunder died away in the distance, Bomba rose\r\nwith a sigh and for a few moments left Tatuc alone on the broken\r\nflooring of the hut.\r\n\r\nThen with the machete and a sharp stick that he found near by, he dug\r\na rude grave for his friend. The ground was soft, and the task did\r\nnot take long.\r\n\r\nThis done, Bomba went to the hut, lifted the body of Tatuc, bore it\r\nto the long narrow hole in the ground, and placed the remains in it.\r\n\r\nThe boy stood for several minutes, head bowed, heart heavy, looking\r\nmournfully at all that was left of the friend whom he had known and\r\ncherished for many years. Bomba had many fond recollections of that\r\nfriendship. It had supplied in large part what he had lacked in human\r\ncompanionship. How many times a visit to Tatuc had relieved his sore\r\nand lonely heart!\r\n\r\n“The vultures shall not have you, Tatuc,” he said simply.\r\n\r\nThen he covered the body with palm leaves and over them put earth. He\r\nfinished his work by piling up a cairn of heavy stones, so that no\r\nmarauding beast of the jungle should search out the resting place of\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\nThen Bomba threw himself face downward near the spot. He lay there\r\nfor a long time motionless. He was swept by an intolerable sense of\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that he was a mere atom in the world. Who would care\r\nwhether he lived or died? The white men were gone. He did not believe\r\nthat he would ever see them again. Tatuc was gone. Casson was left.\r\nBut Casson had become a mere child again and could not remember, did\r\nnot want to talk, was wrapped in apathy, as much of a companion as a\r\nstone image.\r\n\r\nBut he had talked once, had almost remembered! Perhaps if Bomba were\r\npatient he would remember more one day. Then perhaps Bomba would\r\nlearn more of what he meant when he had spoken those words that were\r\nindelibly engraven upon the boy’s memory, “Bartow,” “Laura.”\r\n\r\nBomba raised himself from the ground and for the last time stood\r\nbeside the grave of Tatuc.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” he murmured, and then he choked.\r\n\r\nTurning and dashing the tears from his eyes, he plunged into the\r\nrain-drenched jungle.\r\n\r\nTurned, though he knew it not, toward a more grisly peril than he had\r\nyet encountered!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nGRIPPED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fury of the storm was over, but evidences of it remained.\r\n\r\nCastanha nuts lay thick upon the ground. Here a tree had been riven\r\nby lightning from top to base. There a forest monarch, uprooted by\r\nthe gale, lay prostrate.\r\n\r\nAgain and again Bomba was compelled to make detours. But he advanced\r\nrapidly, nevertheless, so much was he a part of the jungle. He\r\navoided upflung roots and intertwining vines as though by instinct.\r\n\r\nAt times he had to use his machete to force a way for himself through\r\nthe bushes. In other places, where the undergrowth was not too high,\r\nhe progressed after the manner of the Indians, in a succession of\r\ndeer-like leaps that carried him over the obstacles in his path.\r\n\r\nHis steps now led him toward the ygapo, for it was necessary for him\r\nto pass through the swamp before reaching the river beyond which lay\r\nthe maloca of the Araos, a comparatively friendly tribe with whom\r\nhe and Casson had had no differences, although there was never any\r\nintimacy between them.\r\n\r\nFrom these he hoped to obtain a pair of cotton hammocks to replace\r\nthose that had been burned in the fire that had visited the hut. He\r\nwould gather something on the way to pay for them, perhaps a jaboty\r\nor agouti, or possibly some eggs of the forest tortoise, which were\r\nalways acceptable to natives of the region.\r\n\r\nHe might, too, learn something about the plans of the head-hunters,\r\nif those fierce foes were still in that part of the jungle. Since his\r\nfirst encounter, he had seen no traces of them, although the thought\r\nof them was always in the back of his mind.\r\n\r\nAs Casson had said, the savages were like children, as far as fixity\r\nof purpose was concerned. They were ignorant and superstitious, and\r\nany unlooked-for incident might be interpreted by them as a sign of\r\nthe displeasure of their gods at their present expedition and make\r\nthem return to their home near the Giant Cataract.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba knew that such good luck was not to be relied on. He knew\r\nthat at this very moment the band of invaders might be searching\r\nthe jungle, intent on taking the life of Casson, and that in all\r\nlikelihood they would try to complete their work by taking his own.\r\n\r\nBut it was likely that the Araos would know something of the\r\nwhereabouts of the head-hunters, who were as much a foe of theirs as\r\nof the two whites. Bomba thought he might make some kind of a treaty\r\nwith the more friendly natives to help him and Casson in case of\r\nneed, or at least to keep him informed by some swift courier of any\r\nthreatening developments.\r\n\r\nNature was beautiful in the jungle after the storm. The sky above\r\nwas turquoise and the air, washed clean by rain, was like topaz. The\r\nvivid green of the shrubs and the grasses shone like emerald.\r\n\r\nThe living things had come out from the shelters to which they had\r\nbeen driven by the tempest. Clouds of mazarine-colored butterflies\r\nflitted from flower to flower. Humming-birds, green-backed,\r\nlily-breasted, with purple throat and crest, darted hither and\r\nthither like living gems, with a hundred firelike reflections\r\nscintillating from their little bodies.\r\n\r\nThen there were the trogons, motmots and kingfishers glowing with\r\niridescent hues, flocks of scarlet macaws, flamingoes almost equally\r\ngorgeous, each standing on one long slender leg and basking in the\r\nsun; herons, plover, toucans and scores of other curious birds that\r\nmake the Amazon jungle the most wonderful natural aviary on earth.\r\n\r\nBomba had the soul of a poet, and the beauty of it all sank deep.\r\nFor a time he almost forgot his errand, so entranced was he by the\r\nglories spread so lavishly about him. He paused to look about in\r\ndelight mingled with wonder that such loveliness could exist.\r\n\r\nNot only the living things, but the plants and trees and flowers had\r\ntheir appeal to him. There was the giant mora tree, two hundred feet\r\nhigh, aglow with clusters of scarlet blossoms, feathery palms, the\r\nbright yellow trumpet flower with blooms so large that they were worn\r\nas hats by the Indian women and children, huge fuchsias with their\r\npurplish tubular bells, heliotrope, verbenas, orchids, glowing with\r\nall the colors of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe whole region was ablaze with beauty beyond the power of an artist\r\nto paint or the imagination of a dreamer to conceive.\r\n\r\nAs Bomba approached the edge of the ygapo, however, the beauty began\r\nto fade, and nature assumed a more sombre aspect. The riot of color\r\ndied on the borders of the swamp, and its place was taken by drabness\r\nand desolation.\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of sick distaste Bomba left the region that had almost\r\nmade him lose himself in dreams and began to thread the mazes of the\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\nPart of it was intersected with deep pools, in which he had to wade,\r\nsometimes to the waist. Other sections were comparatively free from\r\nwater, but deep in mud.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba knew the swamp as he knew the jungle, knew how to keep a\r\nreasonably straight course through the pathless waste and how to\r\navoid the deeper and more dangerous parts.\r\n\r\nHe had gone about halfway across the dismal place when he came upon\r\na sight that chilled the blood in his veins. Used as he was to the\r\npresence of all sorts of reptiles in the jungle, and especially in\r\nthe ygapo, he was filled with a sensation of loathing and disgust as\r\nhe viewed the scene before him.\r\n\r\nIn a shallow, muddy pool, about thirty feet in front of him, he saw\r\na mass of writhing snakes, gray in color like the mud in which they\r\nwallowed.\r\n\r\n“Sucurujus!” muttered Bomba, as he saw that the group embraced scores\r\nof the dreaded anacondas of the Amazon.\r\n\r\nThey were of all sizes, some of them six or seven feet in length,\r\nothers three times as long.\r\n\r\nThey seemed at first to take no notice of Bomba. Most of them were\r\nsleeping, some with their bodies half-submerged beneath the lukewarm,\r\nshallow ooze. Others had crawled upon the bodies of their comrades,\r\nwhile still others lay lazily on the borders of the pool, basking in\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nLucky for him, thought Bomba, that he had not been crossing the ygapo\r\nafter the setting of the sun had bathed the swamp in darkness. To\r\nhave stepped into that crawling mass would have meant certain and\r\nhorrible death.\r\n\r\nBomba hated the anaconda more than he did any other denizen of the\r\njungle. That hate dated back to the time he had been attacked by\r\none of the reptiles and Casson had fired the rifle, which, though\r\nit frightened away the anaconda, had had such dire results to poor\r\nCasson himself.\r\n\r\nHis hand fell on the butt of his revolver, which he had taken care to\r\nload again while he was in the little native hut, after he had buried\r\nTatuc. It was a tempting target that offered itself to him.\r\n\r\nA few shots into that writhing mass would take a terrible toll. In a\r\nsense, it would take revenge for Casson’s injury. His finger itched\r\nto pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nBut he restrained himself. It would be well to let well enough alone.\r\nThey were lazy and somnolent, scarcely aware of his presence. Why\r\nprovoke a conflict which he might avoid?\r\n\r\nBesides, cartridges were precious, and he must conserve them.\r\n\r\nSo, with a sigh, he restrained the impulse and, edging his way to the\r\nright, he made a wide circle about the nest of snakes, watching the\r\nground carefully, lest one of the monsters should cross his path.\r\n\r\nBut it was from above that danger came.\r\n\r\nA dark, sinister, rope-like body slithered silently from a tree above\r\nBomba’s head.\r\n\r\nThe next instant what seemed a band of iron tightened about the boy’s\r\nchest!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nIN THE FOLDS OF A BOA CONSTRICTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nA thrill of terror ran through Bomba.\r\n\r\nHe knew in an instant what had happened. A great boa, lying in wait\r\nfor whatever living thing might pass beneath the tree, had darted\r\ndown upon him. The coils of the great snake were tightening upon him\r\ninexorably.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he gave himself up for lost. And lost he inevitably\r\nwould have been, had the snake retained the grip of its tail upon the\r\nbough. This it was that gave it the purchase required for squeezing\r\nits prey to death.\r\n\r\nBut the bough was slippery from the recent rain, and the fury of the\r\nreptile’s sudden dart tore the tail loose from the point of support.\r\n\r\nThe great body fell with a thud. The coils did not relax. But on the\r\nother hand they could not tighten until the snake, lashing wildly\r\nabout, could find some stump or tree to encircle with its tail and\r\nuse it as a lever.\r\n\r\nBomba felt as though his lungs were bursting, his ribs cracking. He\r\nexpected every second to be crushed into a shapeless mass.\r\n\r\nThe snake had wound about his body, but the boy’s arms remained free.\r\nDesperately he felt for his machete. He drew it forth from its sheath\r\nwith his right hand and slashed furiously at the enfolding coils.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the iron bands seemed to press all the closer. The\r\ninfuriated reptile raised its horrid head and struck at the boy’s\r\nneck. Bomba dodged, and the fangs buried themselves in his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAgain and again Bomba lashed out frantically with his knife. Each\r\ntime the weapon found its mark. Bomba could feel that the coils were\r\nrelaxing slightly.\r\n\r\nOnce more the terrible head was raised high in the air for another\r\nblow. And at that instant a lucky slash went deep and severed the\r\nspinal cord.\r\n\r\nThe threatened blow never descended. The head wavered and fell. Bomba\r\ngrasped it with his left hand and, summoning all his strength, struck\r\nthe reptile in the throat, completely severing the head from the\r\nbody. The coils unwound and fell in a heap at the boy’s feet.\r\n\r\nBomba threw the head from him with a sharp exclamation of disgust,\r\nmingled with relief, and stepped quickly to one side to escape\r\nthe flailing of the writhing, twisting body of the headless boa\r\nconstrictor.\r\n\r\nHe had been close to death. Only the slipping of the snake’s tail\r\nfrom the slippery bough had saved him. His brave heart alone would\r\nnot have availed.\r\n\r\nWith a shudder of repulsion he examined his foe, after the thrashing\r\nhad subsided and the great snake lay quiet.\r\n\r\nBomba had seen much larger snakes, but this was quite large enough,\r\nthe boy reflected, as he rubbed his chest, bruised and sore from the\r\npressure of the folds. The reptile was about twelve feet long and as\r\nthick as Bomba’s leg.\r\n\r\nThe horrible head, lying a little distance from the body, still gaped\r\nat him, though the malignant glitter of the eyes had been glazed by\r\ndeath. Bomba shuddered as he thought how nearly those awful fangs had\r\nbeen imbedded in his throat. But they had sunk into his shoulder.\r\n\r\nNow, as well as he could, he examined the wound. It was causing him\r\nsevere pain, but no apprehension. He knew that the boa constrictor\r\ncarried no poison in its jaws. Its terrible crushing power was its\r\nmain reliance. His shoulder would be sore for a few days, and that\r\nwas all. He cleansed the wound with water from a pool, and then wiped\r\nhis bloody hunting knife on a wad of leaves.\r\n\r\n“You did well,” he said aloud, addressing his trusty weapon as he\r\nthrust it back into his girdle of cloth. “You have served Bomba many\r\ntimes, but never better than this.”\r\n\r\nOnce more he went on his way, but, warned by his adventure, his eyes\r\nscanned the trees above him as carefully as they did the ground\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nBefore long he had passed through the dreary ygapo and heard in the\r\ndistance the musical tinkle of a waterfall. It was a sound that made\r\nhis heart leap with pleasure. Again and again he had viewed the fall,\r\nentranced, as the spray-crested torrent dashed over the lip of the\r\ncliff into the whirling vortex of water beneath that formed the first\r\nof the series of great rapids rushing onward to the river.\r\n\r\nBomba loved the waterfall. It spoke to him in a vague and mystic way\r\nof forces unchained. As he came now in full sight of it, there was\r\nsomething in the power and wild beauty of the rushing waters that\r\nstruck an answering chord in his soul, causing his blood to run more\r\nswiftly and making his eyes kindle with delight.\r\n\r\nWhat made him feel that way? Bomba brooded over this, as he brooded\r\nover many of the strange thoughts and emotions that puzzled him.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if the caboclos felt as he did about this magnificent\r\ncascade. He remembered that he had seen one of them come out from\r\nthe jungle and stand for a moment above the rushing waters, looking\r\ndown upon them.\r\n\r\nThere had been no change in the expression of the caboclo. He had not\r\nseemed to be drinking in the beauty of it all. If the man had loved\r\nthe waterfall as Bomba did, his face would have lighted up and his\r\neyes would have laughed, as Bomba had seen his own laugh one day when\r\nhe had suddenly seen his face reflected in the pellucid waters of a\r\nlovely pool.\r\n\r\nBomba had not known himself then. He had started back from the image\r\nin the pool as though from some mysterious thing hiding beneath the\r\nsurface of the water. But when, gaining courage, he had again peered\r\nover the rim, his face looked back at him, and he knew it was his own.\r\n\r\nBut the face now was puzzled and solemn. It had lost the first\r\nlaughing look, the look of some one on whom a radiant vision has\r\nburst. He tried again to laugh, but it was not the same. The laughter\r\nwas forced. What a strange changing mixture of emotions he possessed!\r\nHe was something, then, besides form and features. There was more in\r\nhim than he could touch and see. Could it be perhaps because he had\r\nsomething that the white men had called a soul? What was this soul?\r\n\r\nMany, many lonely hours Bomba had spent wondering about this.\r\n\r\nWhy did he never see that look upon the face of Casson? Why did the\r\nfaces of the natives always wear to Bomba the same dull and stupid\r\nlook, as dull and stupid, Bomba thought, and often more so, than the\r\nfaces of his jungle friends? Why were the faces of the Indians always\r\nthe same, except when they darkened and grew fierce and stern? Why\r\ndid beauty not appeal to them as it did to him?\r\n\r\nBomba felt sure that the native tribes who lived within sight and\r\nsound of the great cascade, who could feast their eyes on it whenever\r\nthey would, did not love it as he did. They thought of it only as the\r\nabode of spirits, some good, most of them bad, and believed that the\r\nevil spirits walked at night. During the dark hours they remained\r\nclose within the circle of the maloca, where the night fires burned\r\nbright.\r\n\r\nBomba did not believe that evil spirits dwelt in the waterfall. It\r\nwas beautiful, and to Bomba beautiful things were good.\r\n\r\nWhy did they feel so differently from him? Was it because they did\r\nnot have souls? He dismissed this thought as improbable. But perhaps\r\ntheir souls were asleep. Ah, that must be it! They were asleep!\r\n\r\nBut his was awake. At least it was waking. Perhaps that was because\r\nhe was white. The thought gave him a thrill. Now he was sure that he\r\nhad found the truth. The natives’ souls were asleep. The white men’s\r\nsouls were awake. And he was white!\r\n\r\nHe had been so absorbed in his broodings that he had become almost\r\noblivious of the passage of time. A glance at the sun startled him.\r\nHe must hurry.\r\n\r\nWith a last lingering look at the beautiful cascade and a mental\r\nresolve to return to it soon, he struck off at a tangent into the\r\njungle, gliding along silently and swiftly, eager to make up for the\r\ntime he had spent in dreaming.\r\n\r\nHe reproached himself for having lingered. Why had he forgotten for\r\nthe moment Casson, poor old helpless Casson, left alone in the hut,\r\nan easy prey to the stealthy head-hunters if they should succeed in\r\nferreting out his location.\r\n\r\nHe was hurrying along when he suddenly stopped short.\r\n\r\nIn his path were the freshly made tracks of a jaguar!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nAT THE WATER HOLE\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba’s hand went swiftly to his revolver as his keen eyes swept the\r\nsurrounding jungle.\r\n\r\nNothing ominous met his straining sight. There was no sign of the\r\ndreaded monarch of the forest.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was but little reassuring. Bomba knew the stealth of\r\nthe cruel beast, as subtle as it was ferocious. Its tawny hide was\r\nlittle discernible from the grasses and shrubs of the jungle.\r\n\r\nPerhaps at this very moment its greenish-yellow eyes were fastened\r\nupon him from the shelter of some thicket. Possibly it was crouching\r\non a branch of one of the overhanging trees, its body flattened so\r\nclose to the bough that it seemed a part of the tree itself.\r\n\r\nBut it was best not to stand waiting too long. He was as much in\r\ndanger there as though he were speeding through the jungle. Death\r\nmight pounce on him at any time. But he was glad of the warning.\r\n\r\nWith his revolver held ready for instant use, Bomba started again\r\nthrough the forest, his keen eyes searching every tuft of underbrush\r\nand scanning the branches of every tree under which he passed.\r\n\r\nOnly after half an hour had passed without incident did his tense\r\nnerves relax, though he abated not a jot of his vigilance.\r\n\r\nThe jaguar had passed that way but a little while before, but had\r\nprobably not been aware of the boy’s close proximity.\r\n\r\nBomba was thankful that not all the animals of the jungle were his\r\nenemies. He had repeated proofs of this as he moved swiftly along.\r\n\r\nMonkeys followed his course through the branches of the trees,\r\nchattering at him and playfully throwing handfuls of leaves and small\r\nnuts down on his head.\r\n\r\nThe parrots shrieked and screamed at him, and once one of them\r\ndropped on his shoulders, accompanying him on this moving perch a\r\nconsiderable distance through the woods.\r\n\r\nA little later Bomba came across a jaboty, or forest turtle. He\r\npounced upon it eagerly, and trussing it up with bush cord, swung it,\r\nstill alive, across his shoulders. If he could also get an agouti or\r\na capivara, he would have something to give the Araos when he should\r\ncome upon their maloca. He would not come empty-handed. He would\r\nhave delicacies that they prized, and they would be ready to listen\r\nfavorably to his request for the hammocks in exchange.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he had been conscious of a growing thirst. The heat\r\nand his exertions, together with the exciting events to which he\r\nhad been a party, had parched his throat and lips. His tongue felt\r\nswollen.\r\n\r\nHe looked around in the hope that he might find a cactus. This he\r\ncould slit with his machete and secure as much as he wanted of the\r\ncooling delicious waters that these plants store up, a fact that, if\r\nknown, would have saved the lives of many of those who have perished\r\nof thirst in the very shadow of the thorny plants.\r\n\r\nBut there was no cactus in the immediate vicinity, and this denial of\r\nhis need only served to make his thirst more intense.\r\n\r\nHe knew that at a little distance from the line he was traversing\r\nthere was a water hole, fed by subterranean springs that never ran\r\ndry. More than once he had slaked his thirst at this.\r\n\r\nHe turned now and headed in that direction. He was parched with a\r\nterrible thirst that only dwellers in the jungle or the desert can\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nHe had left the trail to take a short cut to the water hole, for\r\nhe knew the regular trail used by the jungle beasts was still some\r\ndistance ahead.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he paused, his machete with which he had been hewing his\r\nway, raised. He held himself rigidly motionless. What was that he had\r\nheard?\r\n\r\nIt was the slithering of a snake through the underbrush, but a snake\r\nthat, disturbed, was gliding away from the intruding boy.\r\n\r\nHe was fast nearing the water hole. He quickened his steps, licking\r\nhis dry lips with his parched tongue. A few minutes more and his eyes\r\nwould be gladdened by the sight of the pool, its mirror-like surface\r\nreflecting back the heavy foliage and the waving crest of palms that\r\ngrew close at its edge. What great draughts of that cooling water he\r\nwould drink! How he would revel in its plenty!\r\n\r\nBut even the terrible thirst that tormented Bomba could not rob him\r\nof his caution. He knew that the creatures of the jungle resorted\r\nthere. So with extreme care he advanced toward the fringe of trees\r\nthat still hid the water hole from view.\r\n\r\nSilently he parted the bushes and looked through.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw there caused him to grind his teeth with rage. A deep\r\ngrowl formed in his arid throat. For that moment Bomba was all\r\nprimitive.\r\n\r\nHe was thirsty but he could not drink. Others had reached the pool\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nThree pumas, the panthers of the Amazon, had gathered at the water’s\r\nedge and were drinking contentedly.\r\n\r\nAgain the growl in Bomba’s throat. He raised his revolver in an\r\nimpulsive gesture, but quickly lowered it. Caution told him it was\r\nwiser not to enrage such powerful foes. They were three to one. Bomba\r\nstill desired to live.\r\n\r\nThere was a movement behind him.\r\n\r\nBomba turned swiftly about, every muscle tense to meet an attack from\r\nthe newcomer!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nA BATTLE ROYAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came the padding of feet and a pushing aside of the bushes, and\r\nBomba could see the outlines of a great body of some member of the\r\nfour-footed tribe advancing toward him.\r\n\r\nSome other denizen of the jungle coming to refresh himself at the\r\nwater hole. Bomba’s pulses beat fast. There were enemies now behind\r\nhim as well as in front of him. They had come to enjoy a drink. They\r\nmight stay to enjoy a feast, with Bomba furnishing the material for\r\nthe banquet. It was a gruesome prospect, and Bomba could feel the\r\nchills creeping over him.\r\n\r\nHe gripped his weapon tightly, prepared to sell his life dearly,\r\nthough he knew that against such odds he had no chance of escape.\r\n\r\nThe bushes parted and a great head looked through.\r\n\r\nBomba raised his weapon, but he dropped it again when he saw that\r\nhead more distinctly. At the same moment the newcomer raised his paw\r\nin a gesture that Bomba knew.\r\n\r\nThe boy thrust his revolver in his belt and bounded toward the great\r\npuma.\r\n\r\n“Polulu!” Bomba cried, and clapped the great beast upon the flank, as\r\na civilized boy might have fondled a pet dog. “You have come in time.\r\nYou will get me my drink. Look!”\r\n\r\nThe puma rubbed his head against the boy, and they went together\r\ntoward the fringe of trees.\r\n\r\nWhen Polulu saw the other pumas at the pool his eyes gleamed\r\nviciously, his tail swished the bushes, and a growl started rumbling\r\nin his throat.\r\n\r\nFor gentle as Polulu was with the boy who had saved him when trapped\r\nby the tree, he was fierceness itself as far as his fellows were\r\nconcerned. Because of this and his gigantic size and strength, he\r\nwas respected and feared by all the other beasts of the jungle. He\r\nbrooked no opposition, and swept every one who dared to dispute his\r\nrule remorselessly out of the way.\r\n\r\nHe had gathered that Bomba was thirsty but was afraid to go near the\r\npool because of the foes that clustered there. Very well, Polulu\r\nwould see to that! His friend should have his drink!\r\n\r\nBomba watched his companion with breathless interest and curiosity,\r\nas Polulu stalked majestically through the heavy brush and\r\napproached the other pumas on the edge of the pool.\r\n\r\nThey had stopped drinking, but still lingered in the pleasant spot.\r\nIt was plain by their attitudes as they lounged among the soft wet\r\nferns at the water’s edge that they were in no hurry to depart.\r\n\r\nPolulu came steadily down toward them. As he approached, the other\r\npumas sprang to their feet and gathered together at one side of the\r\npool, as though to combine against a common enemy. Battle was in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nWhen he had almost reached them, Polulu stopped and growled warningly.\r\n\r\nThree growls answered him, and Polulu knew that, confident in their\r\nnumbers, they were accepting the challenge. They were defying his\r\nauthority, a thing that none of them would have dared do if alone.\r\n\r\nJungle bred as Bomba was and used to fighting for his right to live,\r\na momentary doubt entered his heart as to whether he ought to ask\r\nPolulu, his friend Polulu, to give battle against such odds in a\r\nquarrel not his own.\r\n\r\nBut such thoughts were idle. In the jungle, if one lived at all,\r\none must not question but must act. Moreover, the puma was filled\r\nnow with the excitement and joy of battle and could not be stopped\r\nbefore victory or defeat had come to him.\r\n\r\nPolulu started forward, his big head swinging from side to side,\r\nyellow eyes gleaming, lips drawn back wickedly from his fangs.\r\n\r\nBefore him the other beasts gave ground slowly, grudgingly, growling\r\nwith increasing irritation as they were crowded back toward the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nThey were not really angry yet. Polulu’s strange conduct bewildered\r\nthem. They did not know his object. Ordinarily the beasts shared the\r\nwater hole without dispute, their fighting instincts subdued for the\r\ntime by the gratification of a common need.\r\n\r\nBut now they were growing fierce from this summary eviction. When\r\nPolulu would have driven them still further back, so as to give Bomba\r\nfree access to the water hole, their growls grew more menacing and\r\ntheir bodies crouched closer to the ground.\r\n\r\nBut they had been crowded a considerable distance away from the pool,\r\nand Polulu turned and looked at Bomba as though to assure him that\r\nthe way was clear.\r\n\r\nBomba would gladly have waited until the trio of enemies were fairly\r\nout of sight. But he knew now that Polulu would feel hurt and\r\nbewildered if he did not come. It would make the brute seem foolish.\r\nHad he not driven off Bomba’s enemies? Was he not now standing guard?\r\nDid Bomba distrust his power?\r\n\r\nThe boy no longer hesitated.\r\n\r\nSwiftly, with great deer-like leaps, he covered the distance to the\r\nedge of the water hole.\r\n\r\nSo sudden was the action that the great cats, their eyes fastened on\r\nthe least movement of Polulu, were taken completely by surprise.\r\n\r\nBomba flung himself on the ground and had drunk great draughts of the\r\nclear cold water before they fairly grasped the situation.\r\n\r\nHere was a new enemy. An enemy easier to fight than Polulu. Their\r\nhair began to bristle and they commenced to creep forward, their\r\nbodies, still close to the ground, moving almost as sinuously as so\r\nmany snakes.\r\n\r\nPolulu roared fiercely and struck at the nearest puma, raking him\r\nwith his sharp claws from shoulder to thigh.\r\n\r\nWith a horrible scream of rage and pain, the wounded puma sprang at\r\nPolulu. But the old puma was quicker than the young one. His powerful\r\njaws clamped about the throat of his adversary and worked savagely.\r\nNo amount of thrashing about or raking with claws could shake off\r\nthat grip.\r\n\r\nThe other pumas, temporarily daunted by the terrible punishment that\r\nPolulu was inflicting, began to creep toward Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe lad raised his revolver and pressed the trigger. The bullet sped\r\nstraight and true, pierced the eye of the nearest puma and penetrated\r\nto the brain.\r\n\r\nThe stricken beast leaped into the air and then fell sprawling upon\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThe report seemed to madden the remaining brute. With a howl of fury\r\nit sprang at Bomba.\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash, the boy dodged, missing by a fraction of an inch\r\nthe impact of that heavy body and the death-dealing blow of the\r\nterrible paw.\r\n\r\nAs Bomba leaped, his foot caught under a root, and he almost fell. In\r\nhis struggle to regain his balance, the revolver fell from his hand.\r\n\r\nThe puma had turned and crouched for another spring. Bomba had no\r\ntime to stoop and recover his weapon. The boy gave himself up for\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nBut even as the puma launched itself in its spring, a great body shot\r\nacross Bomba’s vision and met the assailant in mid-air.\r\n\r\nIt was Polulu who had finished his first opponent and now came to the\r\nrescue of his friend.\r\n\r\nTeeth tearing, claws going like piston rods, the ferocious brutes\r\nfell to the ground and rolled over and over, growling, spitting,\r\nbiting, each trying to get a strangle-hold on the other’s throat.\r\nNo quarter was to be given in that desperate fight. It was to be a\r\nbattle to the death.\r\n\r\nBomba, gladdened by his sudden deliverance when all hope had seemed\r\nlost, stepped back out of reach of the combatants. He felt for his\r\nrevolver and found it.\r\n\r\nBomba could see now that Polulu, wearied from his first victorious\r\nbattle, was at a disadvantage against the fresh young puma. The boy\r\ncircled about the duelists, seeking for an opportunity to help the\r\nfriend who had so loyally helped him.\r\n\r\nThe chance came sooner than he had expected.\r\n\r\nThe young puma sprawled across the back of Polulu. His fangs sank\r\ninto the old veteran’s neck, his teeth seeking the spinal cord.\r\nPolulu rolled over in a desperate attempt to dislodge his enemy. The\r\nmovement brought the young puma’s head directly within the range of\r\nBomba’s revolver.\r\n\r\nBomba did not hesitate. He fired instantly. The shot struck the puma\r\nin the center of the forehead.\r\n\r\nIt did not kill him, but it stunned him and made him relinquish his\r\ngrip.\r\n\r\nThe next instant a second bullet penetrated to the brain. The brute\r\nstruggled convulsively for a moment, then straightened out and lay\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nBomba went over to Polulu. The old puma was exhausted and bleeding\r\nfrom a dozen wounds.\r\n\r\nBomba put his arm about the neck of his friend, and Polulu rubbed his\r\nhead against the boy and tried to lick his face.\r\n\r\n“Polulu!” exclaimed Bomba, as he caressed the great head, “you are\r\nbrave. You are strong. You are the best of all the beasts of the\r\njungle.”\r\n\r\nPolulu purred complacently, as though to say he knew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nAN UNEXPECTED RECEPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe puma and the boy rested for a time, while Polulu licked his\r\nwounds, and when Bomba went on again the puma accompanied him for\r\nsome distance through the jungle.\r\n\r\nIt was getting late, and Bomba began to wonder whether he would be\r\nable to visit the village of the Araos and return on the same day.\r\n\r\nHe could spend the night in the jungle, of course. He had done it\r\nmany times before and had not been afraid. Now, especially with\r\nPolulu to guard him, he would be safe enough.\r\n\r\nBut Casson! There was always Casson. At any time now he might be made\r\nthe victim of an attack by the fierce head-hunters of Nascanora. And\r\nwhen that time came, if it should come, Bomba wanted to be at the old\r\nman’s side to live or die with him as fate might determine.\r\n\r\nHe pushed on as fast as he could, the faithful Polulu still beside\r\nhim, the jaboty slung over his shoulder. He was getting close to the\r\nmaloca now, and if there was any chance of accomplishing his errand\r\nand getting back before midnight, he meant to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nStill faster he went, Polulu padding beside him and keeping away by\r\nhis presence not only jungle enemies but Bomba’s friends, the monkeys\r\nand the parrots, who gave him a wide berth when they saw the grim\r\nguardian that kept pace with him.\r\n\r\nWhen they drew near to the place where Bomba expected to find the\r\ntribe he was searching for, the boy said good-bye to Polulu, telling\r\nhim that if the Indians saw him coming accompanied by a puma they\r\nwould consider his visit an unfriendly one.\r\n\r\nWhether Polulu clearly understood this or not, he knew that he had\r\nreceived his dismissal, and with a last friendly rub of his tawny\r\nhead he disappeared into the jungle. But Bomba had a feeling that\r\nhe was hovering somewhere near, ready at the slightest need to come\r\nagain to his help.\r\n\r\nBomba began to be troubled now because he had no more to take as a\r\npresent to the Araos than the jaboty. He had had so much to do in\r\npreserving his life through the course of the momentous day that he\r\nhad had but little time to look for game.\r\n\r\nOnce he thought that fortune was going to favor him. It was when he\r\ncaught sight of a tapir close to the edge of a small stream. But the\r\ntapir had seen him first and disappeared like a shadow in the depths\r\nof the jungle before Bomba could bring his weapon into play.\r\n\r\nHe was greatly disappointed at this. Some tapir meat would have been\r\na succulent present to bring to the Araos. Laden with such a gift, he\r\ncould hardly have failed to be received with gratitude and friendship.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had no more time to hunt. He at least had the jaboty, and\r\nhe could promise to bring the natives more game at some future time\r\nif they would let him have the hammocks he needed.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a drum rang through the jungle. Bomba halted, head up,\r\nevery sense alert.\r\n\r\nHe was hard upon some Indian maloca, that was certain. The medicine\r\nman of the tribe was beating the drum to propitiate the particular\r\ngod worshipped by his people.\r\n\r\nWas it the village of the Araos he was approaching? It should be, by\r\nhis reckoning of time and distance. Yet it was by no means certain,\r\nfor these tribes shifted their locations frequently as they followed\r\nthe game trails or searched for better fishing places.\r\n\r\nEven if it were some other tribe, however, Bomba had no reason, he\r\nthought, to fear their active unfriendliness. The head-hunters were\r\nthe only real enemies that he was conscious of having in the jungle.\r\n\r\nHe went on, therefore, trying to stifle some vague premonition\r\nthat was stirring within him. He had a feeling, an instinct, that\r\nsomething unpropitious was in the air.\r\n\r\nSoon the increasing signs of human habitation warned him that he was\r\nin close proximity to a village.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Indian etiquette, which resents a sudden\r\nintrusion, he clapped his hands and shouted.\r\n\r\nThe echo of the shout died away in the forest. There was no answering\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nBomba waited stoically, betraying no outward sign of uneasiness.\r\nAfter a few moments he shouted more loudly than before.\r\n\r\nStill there was no answer, and he began to be seriously perturbed.\r\n\r\nIf the Indians had been in a friendly mood, they would already have\r\nsent out a scout to see who the visitor was, what he wanted, and\r\nwelcome him to the maloca.\r\n\r\nA third time Bomba shouted. Still no answer. All the previous\r\nsounds of life and activity he had noted had been hushed, and above\r\neverything hung the silence of the grave.\r\n\r\nAnd now Bomba had the impression that the jungle was filled with\r\nshadowy, furtive forms. He felt that each tree and thicket might be\r\nhiding an enemy, ready the next instant to make the intruder a target\r\nfor his arrow.\r\n\r\nStill the lad remained quietly where he was, not moving a muscle and\r\nshowing no signs of alarm.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight rustle immediately behind him, and Bomba turned\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nThere, where the instant before had been nothing, stood a\r\ndark-skinned Indian, magnificent in his six-feet-two of brawn and\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\nThe face of the Indian bore no welcoming smile. On it was a scowl so\r\nblack that Bomba’s heart sank within him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nBY A HAIR’S BREADTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a moment’s time Bomba had taken a grip on himself.\r\n\r\nHe returned the scowl of the Indian with a flashing smile that\r\nshowed all his white teeth, and, beating with his two clenched hands\r\nupon his bronzed chest, cried in a loud voice that held no sign of\r\nquavering:\r\n\r\n“Karo Katu Kama-rah!” thus declaring himself “Good white friend!”\r\n\r\nWithout any relaxing of his scowl, the Indian grunted “Ugh” and\r\npointed to the jaboty slung over Bomba’s shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe boy took the still living turtle by the bush cord with which it\r\nwas tied and held it out to the Indian.\r\n\r\nThe latter received it with another grunt, and, beckoning Bomba to\r\nfollow, threaded his way through the bushes to the maloca.\r\n\r\nBomba followed, knowing by a sixth sense that he was himself being\r\nfollowed and spied upon. He could feel eyes boring into his back.\r\nYet not once did he catch sight of a dark-skinned form, nor did the\r\ncracking of a single twig beneath a brown foot betray the presence of\r\nanyone but himself and his Indian guide in all the silent jungle.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they reached the maloca.\r\n\r\nIt was only a small Indian village, with perhaps thirty primitive\r\ndwellings arranged in circular fashion about a small clearing.\r\n\r\nThe “huts” were of the simplest sort. Some were merely hammocks,\r\nswung between two poles. Palm leaves formed the roof of these rude\r\nabodes, wholly insufficient to shelter their owners from the mildest\r\nof tropical storms.\r\n\r\nBut the dwelling of the chief was more elaborate. This was more like\r\nthe cabin that Bomba shared with Casson, except that only two sides\r\nof it were enclosed.\r\n\r\nThe chief met him in the center of the clearing, surrounded by some\r\ndozen stalwart young warriors. The chief himself was an old man,\r\nwizened and toothless, with an inscrutable expression in the small\r\neyes he turned upon Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe latter looked around on the ring of faces. There was nothing\r\nencouraging in them. All bore scowls similar to that of the scout who\r\nhad led him to the maloca.\r\n\r\nBomba stood motionless, the target of all these unfriendly eyes,\r\nwhile the man who had first met him advanced toward the chief and\r\nlaid the jaboty at his feet.\r\n\r\nThere followed a brief harangue in the Indian tongue that was carried\r\non in so low a tone that Bomba could not hear what was said.\r\n\r\nThen the chief motioned to him to come forward. Bomba obeyed, his\r\nface a perfect mask for the tumult of emotions that was surging\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\nThe harangue had evidently not helped his cause. The faces were,\r\nif possible, still more unfriendly, and there were mutterings that\r\nportended an approaching storm.\r\n\r\nCould it be that this tribe had made some sort of treaty with the\r\nhead-hunters and had joined with them in the attempt to kill the two\r\nwhites?\r\n\r\nThis was possible, Bomba thought, but hardly likely. There was\r\na deadly antipathy between the two tribes, and the head-hunters\r\nprobably planned to make the Araos their victims as soon as they had\r\nmade an end of Casson and himself.\r\n\r\nIt was much more probable, Bomba thought, that the visit of the\r\nhead-hunters to that district had been laid by the Araos at the door\r\nof Casson. It might have brought to a head all the superstitious\r\nfeelings they themselves had entertained in regard to the old\r\nnaturalist. Perhaps he was a Man of Evil, as the head-hunters\r\ndeclared. If so, he ought to be put out of the way. At any rate, if\r\nhe were killed, perhaps the head-hunters would go back to the Giant\r\nCataract and trouble the Araos no more.\r\n\r\nIn this conjecture Bomba was right. The tribe was sorely troubled by\r\nthe incursion of their dreaded enemies. At any time they might be\r\nattacked and wiped out. If the whites had not been in that district,\r\nthe head-hunters would not have come.\r\n\r\nSo, on the innocent heads of Casson and Bomba they were prepared to\r\nvent the irritation caused by this invasion. And here was one of the\r\ntroublemakers who had walked right into their hands. What better\r\nopportunity to get him, at least, out of the way? Casson could be\r\ndealt with later.\r\n\r\nSo Bomba’s instinct had not played him false when it had warned him\r\nthat he was in danger. He read doom on the faces of all that scowling\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nHe knew that to try now to escape would be useless. A quick glance\r\nover his shoulder told him that all escape was cut off from the rear.\r\nA score or more of Indians had magically appeared to swell the group,\r\nno doubt those who had been following and spying upon him in the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nThe women and children of the tribe had gathered at one end of the\r\nmaloca, and were looking on stoically at the scene.\r\n\r\nAs Bomba reached the circle of Indians about the chief a dozen\r\nsinewy hands reached out to grasp him. In a moment more he would be\r\nhelpless, a prisoner where he had expected to be a guest. And none\r\nknew better than Bomba what it meant to be a prisoner of the Indians.\r\n\r\nBut before one of the reaching hands could close upon him there came\r\na shrill cry from among the group of squaws and maidens.\r\n\r\nWhile all turned in surprise at this unexpected interruption, a small\r\ngirl, not more than six or seven years old, detached herself from the\r\ngroup and rushed toward Bomba.\r\n\r\nWhile the lad stood amazed and unable to move, the little thing took\r\nhis hand in her own and turned to face the chief.\r\n\r\n“Kama-rah!” she exclaimed impetuously. “Kari Katu Kama-rah!” and\r\ntouched the white boy on the chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE TURN OF THE WHEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nA babble of excited exclamations broke out at this sudden\r\nintervention of the girl in Bomba’s behalf.\r\n\r\n“Pirah!” said the chief, in a voice where sternness was mingled with\r\naffection. “Da-rah!”\r\n\r\nBut Pirah showed no intention of going away. She stamped her foot and\r\nclung the more tightly to Bomba’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe boy recognized her then as the youngest child of the chief,\r\nHondura. He had seen her more than once when he had skirted the\r\nvillage in some of his hunting excursions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the women of the jungle are as a rule even more stolid than\r\nthe men, Pirah promised to be an exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nShe it was who liked to play at hunting, shouldering a bow as big as\r\nherself and learning to shoot at a target when her baby hands could\r\nbarely stretch the strings.\r\n\r\nHer fire and spirit and playful antics had amused the old chief, who\r\nscarcely checked her in anything, and the little Pirah had gradually\r\ngrown into the spoiled and petted darling of the tribe.\r\n\r\nBut now, when she espoused the cause of Bomba, who had come perhaps\r\nto put the tribe under the spell of Casson, the Man of Evil, the\r\nthing was too serious to be laughed at, even by the doting father.\r\n\r\nThere were dark looks on the faces of the younger warriors, and hands\r\nwere again outstretched to seize Bomba.\r\n\r\nBut the eyes of the little maiden flashed and she pushed the nearest\r\nIndian away with her tiny hand.\r\n\r\n“Kama-rah!” she cried again, appealing to her father.\r\n\r\nBut Hondura scowled, and his black face so frightened Pirah that she\r\nshrank back against Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Da-rah!” again commanded her father, and this time the child obeyed\r\nand went back weeping to the group of women.\r\n\r\nWith his little defender gone, strong hands gripped Bomba and drew\r\nhim within the ring of savages.\r\n\r\nBomba felt that this was the end.\r\n\r\nBut again there came an interruption. Peto, the shaman, or medicine\r\nman, of the tribe, came up to Bomba in a slow dreamy way, eyes\r\nclosed, as though he were walking in his sleep.\r\n\r\nThe braves fell back before this man of mystery.\r\n\r\nPeto took hold of Bomba and began to feel all over him, his face, his\r\nhands, his chest, his legs.\r\n\r\nThen Peto went into a violent spasm, twitching and trembling, showing\r\nthe whites of his eyes and foaming at the mouth.\r\n\r\nBomba had stood the hauling and mauling without protest, though\r\nwithout much hope of any good coming from it.\r\n\r\nThe old medicine man broke out into a babble of words, sometimes\r\nalmost beneath his breath, again rising to a shrill scream.\r\n\r\nThe Indians watched him breathlessly, though they sought to repress\r\nany show of emotion.\r\n\r\nPeto continued to open and shut his eyes rapidly, while the muscles\r\nof his face twitched convulsively. At times he would reach out and\r\npinch Bomba’s legs until the lad winced.\r\n\r\nFinally, when Bomba had begun to feel that he could not stand the\r\nstrain much longer, the shaman opened his eyes, looked straight at\r\nthe lad, and cried at the top of his cracked voice:\r\n\r\n“Kari Katu Kama-rah!”\r\n\r\nThe words had a magical effect upon the Indians. The scowls\r\ndisappeared instantly from their faces and they echoed in chorus:\r\n\r\n“Kari Katu Kama-rah!”\r\n\r\nBomba was saved. Peto had declared that the jungle boy was a friend,\r\nand Hondura and his braves were willing to accept the medicine man’s\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThe chief motioned Bomba to him, and the boy squatted beside him on\r\nthe ground. The men of the tribe gathered around, as friendly now as\r\nthey had been antagonistic before. Gone was their warlike attitude.\r\nThe change was kaleidoscopic.\r\n\r\nIt had been a matter of touch and go. Bomba marveled at his good\r\nfortune in winning Peto’s approval. Apart from saving his life for\r\nthe present, it would have other consequences. It was no light\r\nmatter to have the Araos on his side, in view of the presence of the\r\nhead-hunters on their deadly mission.\r\n\r\nWhile the chief was questioning Bomba, the little maiden Pirah\r\nlingered wistfully on the outside of the group.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Hondura called her to him. The little one came timidly\r\nand sat down beside Bomba and again took his hand in hers.\r\n\r\nBomba smiled down at her and Pirah smiled back. There were so few\r\nsmiles ever bestowed on the lonely boy that it warmed his heart.\r\n\r\nThe chief seemed pleased, and looked at Bomba with a more friendly\r\nexpression than before.\r\n\r\nTo Bomba’s inquiries about Nascanora and his people Hondura replied\r\nthat the chief of the head-hunters had visited him and professed\r\nfriendship with the Araos. Hondura knew, though, that Nascanora’s\r\nheart was black and that the invaders were only trying to lull him\r\ninto security until they were ready to fall on his people and wipe\r\nthem out. But he was watchful and his braves were ready.\r\n\r\n“Did Nascanora say anything about Casson?” Bomba asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Nascanora wanted one of my Araos to go with him as guide to\r\npoint out the location of Casson’s hut. But I, Hondura, professed\r\nignorance and Nascanora frowned. But finally he went away with words\r\nof friendship.”\r\n\r\nHondura admitted that he, too, had thought that Casson might be a Man\r\nof Evil, as Nascanora had said. But now that Peto had spoken, he knew\r\nthat Casson and Bomba were good. So he, Hondura, would do nothing to\r\naid Nascanora in his designs against the whites.\r\n\r\nThis was balm to Bomba’s anxious soul. The chief object of his\r\nmission had been accomplished. Casson would be glad.\r\n\r\nThe matter of the hammocks was simple. Hondura would have given him\r\nhalf a dozen if Bomba had wanted them. But the boy accepted only the\r\ntwo, and these were brought at the command of the chief and tied up\r\nin a light bundle.\r\n\r\nIt required considerable diplomacy for Bomba to terminate his visit\r\nquickly without offense. They were for having him stay with them for\r\nthat night, several nights if he would. But Bomba managed to impress\r\nthem with the necessity of his getting back to Casson at once, and\r\nthey reluctantly yielded.\r\n\r\nThe chief had noticed that Bomba’s arrows were all gone, and as a\r\nparting proof of friendship insisted on supplying him with a dozen\r\nchoice ones from his own stock.\r\n\r\nThanking him warmly and promising to return again within a short time\r\nbringing gifts, Bomba took leave of Hondura and little Pirah, who\r\nclung to him up to the last moment.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the younger warriors, as a mark of courtesy, accompanied\r\nhim some distance into the jungle, and when they finally left him\r\nrepeated the words of Peto, “Kari Katu Kama-rah!”\r\n\r\nBomba responded earnestly and with a grateful heart, and when they\r\ndisappeared like ghosts in the shadows he was conscious of a still\r\ndeeper sense of the loneliness that of late had become his constant\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThe jungle seemed to him unnaturally still. The screaming of the\r\nparrots was less strident than usual and the chattering of the\r\nmonkeys sounded muffled and far away.\r\n\r\nHis eyes fell on the track of a tapir, and this roused him from his\r\nmusings. He followed it for a short distance, and came upon his\r\nquarry so suddenly that he almost betrayed his presence. But the wind\r\nwas blowing toward him, and he had made no sound.\r\n\r\nThe tapir was standing with his side toward him, offering as good a\r\ntarget as any hunter could wish.\r\n\r\nBomba fitted one of Hondura’s arrows to his bow and let fly.\r\n\r\nThe missile sped swift and true. It struck the tapir at the base\r\nof the skull, and the animal toppled over and died with scarcely a\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nBomba covered the distance between him and his prey in a few leaps.\r\n\r\nGood luck, thought Bomba. He would have something good to take back\r\nto the hut. It would be good to have meat again, after living so long\r\non the eggs of the jaboty.\r\n\r\nHe cut choice steaks from the carcass with his machete. These he\r\nwrapped in leaves, bound with bush cord and slung with the hammocks\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\r\nBomba was jubilant. The day was ending in accordance with his fondest\r\nhopes. He had gained the friendship of the Araos and put an obstacle\r\nin the way of Nascanora. He had with him hammocks, the comfort of\r\nwhich he and Casson had sadly missed. He had replenished his stock of\r\narrows. And there was the tapir meat, which would make a fine meal\r\nfor them both, roasted on a stout stick held over a blazing fire.\r\nYes, it had been a good day!\r\n\r\nThe thought of food moved Bomba to still greater speed. He had eaten\r\nnothing since morning except a handful of roasted Brazil nuts that\r\nPirah had thrust into his hand at parting, and he was ravenous.\r\n\r\nFor another hour he pressed rapidly through the jungle, his eyes\r\nsharply scanning every tree and covert, for dusk was coming on and\r\nthe beasts of prey would soon be starting on their nightly mission of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his steps slackened, for that instinct of his that he had\r\nlearned to trust warned him of danger. It was in the air. He did not\r\nknow just what form it was taking, but he knew that, whatever it was,\r\nit was near at hand.\r\n\r\nAs silently now as a panther he glided on, not a twig snapping\r\nbeneath his sandaled feet.\r\n\r\nSoon a smell of a campfire warned him of human proximity. He crept\r\ncautiously nearer and, peering through the undergrowth, saw dark\r\nforms squatting about a fire. He edged a little nearer until he\r\ncould hear fragments of their guttural speech.\r\n\r\nBomba dropped on his stomach and wormed his way through the brush\r\nuntil he reached the outermost edge of the zone of light cast by the\r\nfire. Then from his screen he slowly raised his head and looked.\r\n\r\nThere were thirty or more savages seated in council. One of them he\r\nrecognized as the man he had met in the forest at the crossing of the\r\ntrails.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the head-hunters, the men who were seeking Casson’s\r\ndeath and his own!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nWORDS OF DOOM\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba’s eyes swept round the circle and rested on the scarred,\r\nhideous face of a powerful savage, the symbols on whose chest\r\nproclaimed him chief.\r\n\r\nHe knew it was his arch-enemy, Nascanora!\r\n\r\nBomba drew a long breath and thanked the jungle instinct that had\r\nwarned him of danger and kept him from blundering right into the\r\nhands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nSome sort of incantation had evidently been in progress, as was\r\nmanifest from the presence of a kettle over the fire in which the\r\nmedicine man had been stirring his horrid brew. The shaman had now\r\ndesisted, and had reported to the chief the will of his gods.\r\n\r\nThat it fitted in with the chief’s plans was shown by the words that\r\nfell from Nascanora’s lips.\r\n\r\n“Cody Casson,” he said. “The gods say he is Man of Evil. He bring\r\ntrouble to the tribe. He must die.”\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” came in a concerted grunt of assent from the men squatted on\r\ntheir haunches about the fire.\r\n\r\nBomba lay motionless, his heart thumping against his ribs. He had\r\ncome at an opportune moment. He would learn the plans of the enemy.\r\n\r\nSo they would kill Casson, would they? Well, they would have to kill\r\nBomba first. His lips drew back from his teeth, and his fingers\r\nsought his knife.\r\n\r\n“We know now where Casson live,” the chief went on. “Morana found the\r\nplace. He tell us wild boy Bomba is away. Casson is alone. We go now.\r\nCatch Man of Evil. We bring him here——”\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” his followers cried again on a higher note of excitement. “We\r\ngo. Now!”\r\n\r\n“We take Man of Evil,” cried Nascanora, the scowl on his distorted\r\nfeatures horrible to see. “We tie him to tree. We make fire,” he made\r\na gesture as though his hands held flint and steel. “We burn Cody\r\nCasson. Then Man of Evil bring not bad things to tribe of Nascanora.”\r\n\r\nBomba waited to hear no more.\r\n\r\nSwiftly, noiselessly, still flat upon his stomach, he backed out\r\nthrough the heavy underbrush and tangle of vines. He knew that not\r\nonly his life but that of Casson depended on his getting away without\r\nletting Nascanora guess at his presence there.\r\n\r\nWhen he had got far enough away to think it safe for him to rise to\r\nhis feet, he was startled by a great noise of shouting that swelled\r\ninto a fiendish shriek.\r\n\r\nHe thought at first that they must have discovered him, despite his\r\ncaution, and were in pursuit. But he had been so careful that he\r\ndismissed this for another solution.\r\n\r\nThe shout must mean that the pow-wow was over, and that they were\r\ngetting ready to start for the hut where Casson waited for Bomba,\r\nalone and unprotected.\r\n\r\nSetting off with strides like those of a deer, Bomba vowed that he\r\nwould outrace the Indians. He must get to the hut before them, or\r\nCasson was lost.\r\n\r\nBut the Indians, too, were swift and adept in getting through the\r\njungle. Knowing that they would take the most direct trail, Bomba was\r\nforced to choose a more circuitous one.\r\n\r\nHis chief hope lay in his extraordinary fleetness of foot. If this\r\ndid not fail him and if he met with no other mishaps in the jungle,\r\nhe might yet be able to reach the hut and make some preparations for\r\ndefense before Nascanora and his followers reached it on their errand\r\nof destruction.\r\n\r\nHe made his way with desperate energy and all the speed he could\r\ninfuse into his legs, pausing for no obstacle great or small.\r\n\r\nIn the course he had chosen lay a primitive bridge that had been\r\nplaced across one of the streams that abounded in the region. The\r\nbridge consisted simply of the trunk of a mirity palm, wet and\r\nslippery from the recent storm.\r\n\r\nIf Bomba had followed his usual custom on such occasions and kicked\r\noff his sandals, so that his bare feet might get a grip on the log,\r\nhe could have passed over it in perfect safety, as he had done\r\nhundreds of times before.\r\n\r\nBut so frantic was his haste and so great his belief in his ability\r\nto maintain his balance on any footing, however precarious, that this\r\ntime he did not stop to remove his sandals.\r\n\r\nHe had traversed almost the entire length of the bridge and had\r\nnearly reached the further shore when he slipped and fell, scrambling\r\nand kicking, into the water.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been so bad if in the fall he had not struck his\r\nhead against the log. This dazed him for a moment, but the shock of\r\nthe water revived him and brought him to the surface sputtering and\r\nfurious.\r\n\r\nHe struck out strongly for the shore, but at the same moment\r\nsomething bit viciously at his leg. Bomba knew at once what it\r\nwas—the saw-toothed piranha, the voracious fish that abounds in all\r\nthe tributaries of the Amazon.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for Bomba that he had been so close to the farther\r\nshore when he fell. A few vigorous strokes, and he reached the\r\nshore. As he drew himself up, another piranha caught his foot in its\r\nvice-like jaws and hung on grimly, even after Bomba had drawn himself\r\nclear of the water.\r\n\r\nBomba kicked out viciously, and the fish loosened its hold and\r\ndropped back into the water. The boy scarcely took time to examine\r\nhis wounds, though they were very painful and, he knew, would be\r\nstill worse on the following day. That was, he thought, with a stab\r\nat his heart, if he should ever see the light of the next day!\r\n\r\nHe was furious with himself. Bomba, to have lost his footing on the\r\nbridge, Bomba, who had always prided himself on being so sure-footed!\r\nThe mishap had delayed him seriously. Perhaps it had sealed Casson’s\r\ndoom and his own.\r\n\r\nThe journey seemed never-ending as he pressed on, spurring his jaded\r\nmuscles to the utmost. He was faint from hunger and wearied by the\r\nmany adventures of that exciting day. His feet felt as if they were\r\nweighted with lead. The one that had been bitten by the piranha was\r\nalready badly swollen, and every step was accompanied by a torturing\r\npang.\r\n\r\nAnd to this physical pain was added the agony of apprehension that\r\nwith every moment became more acute. Had his enemies preceded him?\r\nHad they perhaps already reached the hut?\r\n\r\nAt last he reached the vicinity of the hut. The crisis was at hand.\r\nPerturbed as he was in mind, his jungle cunning did not desert him.\r\n\r\nHe drifted toward the location of the hut like a shadow. Not a twig\r\nsnapped under his feet to betray him. He dropped on his hands and\r\nknees and crept in this position for a hundred yards to a little\r\nelevation from which he would be able to look down directly on the\r\nhut. Reaching the spot, he parted the vines and looked through.\r\n\r\nIt was so dark now that none but jungle-trained eyes could have\r\ndistinguished anything in the dense pall of blackness. But Bomba had\r\neyes almost as keen as those of Polulu.\r\n\r\nNot a sound broke the heavy silence of the night. But for Bomba’s\r\neyes, he might have exulted in the thought that he had outstripped\r\nthe Indians in the race, that he had reached the hut in time to warn\r\nCasson.\r\n\r\nBut there was a shadow near the hut, and at little distances were\r\nother shadows completely encircling it—a sinister ring of threatened\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart beat faster, his breath seemed almost to whistle\r\nthrough his clenched teeth.\r\n\r\nThe odds were fearful ones—thirty to two at least, really thirty to\r\none, for Casson could not be relied on in his half-demented state,\r\nand whatever fighting was done would probably have to be done by\r\nBomba.\r\n\r\nThe jungle boy thought quickly. Force alone would not avail. He must\r\nuse strategy, even as he had used it in the case of the cooanaradi.\r\n\r\nBut what and how? He racked his agonized brain, seizing at some\r\nexpedient only to dismiss it the next moment as futile. And every\r\ninstant he expected to hear the bloodcurdling war whoop of the\r\nsavages as they rushed the cabin.\r\n\r\nThen like a flash it came to him!\r\n\r\nWith incredible swiftness, still on hands and knees, he made his\r\nway to a hollow tree. This had been his playroom since his earliest\r\nchildhood, and in its trunk Bomba had stored many of his treasures.\r\n\r\nChief among these was the skin of a great anaconda, slain by Casson\r\nmany years ago. It had had a great fascination for Bomba, and many a\r\ntime he had arrayed himself in it, dragging its great length behind\r\nhim. Often he had used it to scare playfully his friends of the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nThe monkeys and parrots had fled in dismay, and when Bomba had cast\r\nit aside had returned timidly and looked at him reproachfully for\r\nhaving played a practical joke upon them. Polulu had bared his teeth\r\nwhen he first saw it, and had sheepishly abandoned his hostile\r\nattitude when Bomba had emerged and laughed at him.\r\n\r\nNow it was to serve for something sterner than play. Bomba’s face was\r\ngrim as he got into the great skin and wrapped the front part of it\r\nabout his head and shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe dried head, with the great jaws gaping, had been retained in\r\nits entirety, and Bomba held this before his face as he prepared to\r\nemerge from his hiding place. The horrible object was one calculated\r\nto strike terror to the stoutest heart.\r\n\r\nBut for the full success of the stratagem light was needed. The\r\nIndians must see the fearsome thing in all its ghastliness.\r\n\r\nBomba felt about for one of the pine knots that in earlier days he\r\nhad used to illuminate his play place. He found one, full of resin,\r\nand, concealed by the tree, lighted the torch. In a moment it was\r\nblazing brightly.\r\n\r\nWith a weird, hideous scream that rang through the silent jungle and\r\nstartled it into a hundred echoes, Bomba left his shelter, flinging\r\nthe torch ahead of him and dashed down upon that sinister ring of\r\nfigures about the hut.\r\n\r\nThe ruse worked. There were shrieks of terror, and the savages gave\r\nway before the horrible vision of a snake that ran on two feet and\r\nmade a noise like the screaming of demons!\r\n\r\nThe way to the hut was clear. In a few great bounds Bomba had\r\nreached it and catapulted himself through the doorway.\r\n\r\nWith a hoarse cry Casson grasped a spear that leaned against the wall\r\nnear at hand and raised it on high.\r\n\r\n“No, no, Casson! Do not strike!” gasped the boy, as he let the empty\r\nsnake skin slip from him to the floor. “It is I, Bomba! Look!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nAGAINST FEARFUL ODDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn exclamation of amazement and relief fell from the old naturalist\r\nas he lowered the spear.\r\n\r\n“But why—what—” he stammered, as he lay the weapon aside.\r\n\r\n“The Indians!” panted Bomba, as he slammed the door shut and slipped\r\ninto place the heavy bar he had fashioned while he was rebuilding the\r\nhut. “Nascanora and his head-hunters! They are here. You heard their\r\ncries. They have come to get you, to burn you in a fire.”\r\n\r\nA light of comprehension came into Casson’s old faded eyes.\r\n\r\n“But they shall not,” he cried, with a flare of the old courage and\r\nenergy in which Bomba had formerly taken pride and which he had never\r\nexpected to see again. “We will fight. I do not much care for myself;\r\nbut if they kill me, they will kill you, too. And they shall not do\r\nit! We will beat them off!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried Bomba, his eyes kindling. “But they are many. We shall\r\nhave to fight hard. We will fight with bows and arrows. And when\r\nthey are gone, we will fight some more, you with the spear and I\r\nwith the fire stick. And the machete, too, will be good. Yes, we will\r\nfight.”\r\n\r\nFor a time, however, it seemed that it might not be necessary to\r\nfight. After the first howls of fright and the frantic scurrying of\r\nthe Indians before that awful apparition, a deep silence again fell\r\non the jungle.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, and still the hush continued.\r\n\r\nIn the truce thus gained, Bomba and Casson made all the preparations\r\npossible for the battle that seemed imminent. The old man, under the\r\nstimulus of the danger threatening them, regained something of his\r\nold energy and power to think and act.\r\n\r\nHow long this would continue Bomba did not know. But he was thankful\r\nfor the change. It gave him a sense of comradeship, a relief from\r\nbearing a dead weight, and infused him with new heart and hope. How\r\nmuch Casson would be able to accomplish was of course conjectural,\r\nbut there was a chance that even his feeble help might turn the scale\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\nTogether they got out their stock of arrows and laid them within easy\r\nreach. Bomba fully loaded the revolver and opened all his boxes of\r\ncartridges. The boy, in reconstructing the cabin, had made loopholes\r\non all four sides through which the weapons could be discharged.\r\n\r\nHe took advantage now of the lull, and ate some handfuls of rice and\r\nraw maize and drank copious draughts of water. It was but a meager\r\nmeal, but it refreshed him wonderfully.\r\n\r\nStill the silence persisted, and the little garrison felt some\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n“Do you think they may have gone away?” whispered Casson, with a\r\nlittle accent of hope.\r\n\r\nBomba shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I do not think so,” he answered in the same low tone. “They have\r\ncome too far. They will not go back without trying to kill us.\r\nAt first they thought the snake was magic. They were afraid. But\r\nNascanora will talk to them big words and they will come back. We\r\nshall have to fight.”\r\n\r\nThe last word had scarcely left Bomba’s lips when a terrific chorus\r\nof yells rang out and a concerted rush of savages was made on the\r\ndoor of the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe door bent, but the stout bar of lignum vitæ, almost as strong as\r\niron, refused to break.\r\n\r\nBomba leaped to his feet and grasped his bow. He fitted an arrow to\r\nthe string and took aim through a porthole at the nearest figure.\r\n\r\nThe bow twanged. The arrow whistled on its way. There was a wild\r\nscream from the Indian, who threw up his hands and plunged forward on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nCasson had also snatched a bow and essayed to follow Bomba’s example.\r\nBut his sight was defective and his hand tremulous, and the missile\r\nfailed to find a target.\r\n\r\nBut one of the Indians had fallen anyway, and although this counted\r\nfor little when the number of their foes was considered, the moral\r\neffect was on the side of the besieged. They had got in the first\r\nblow and served notice on the attackers that they would have to pay\r\nin lives for whatever they got.\r\n\r\nThe shadowy figures had disappeared as though by magic, seeking\r\nshelter behind the trees that fringed the clearing.\r\n\r\nBomba could hear the sound of axes. His enemies were cutting down a\r\ntree. For what purpose?\r\n\r\nThe question was quickly answered. A dozen savages emerged from the\r\nshadows, bearing between them a heavy log ten feet long, with the\r\nevident purpose of using it as a battering ram to beat in the door.\r\n\r\nBomba knew that if they succeeded in this, Casson and he were lost.\r\nOnce let that horde invade the cabin, and nothing could avail against\r\noverpowering numbers.\r\n\r\nNo time for arrows now. He had a far quicker weapon at hand. The\r\nwhite man’s fire stick!\r\n\r\nThey were so near that he could not miss. So swiftly that the\r\nrepeated detonations blended into one continuous report, he emptied\r\nthe five chambers of the revolver.\r\n\r\nAt that close range every shot took its toll in dead and wounded.\r\nSeveral fell, others staggered back to the shelter of the woods.\r\nAmong the wounded Bomba recognized the towering figure of Nascanora.\r\nThe log went down with a crash, and the survivors of those who had\r\nbeen carrying it fled in panic.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the execution done, but the way it had been done\r\nthat filled them with fright. Few of them had ever before heard the\r\nreport of a firearm—perhaps none of them. The spurts of flame and the\r\nroar of the weapon confirmed their conviction that the hut was the\r\nhabitation of wizards.\r\n\r\nA snake that walked on two feet! Fire that spoke and killed! What\r\nchance had they with their bows and arrows, especially when they\r\ncould not see their targets?\r\n\r\nBomba handed the revolver to Casson to reload, and in the meantime\r\nfitted another arrow to his bow. But though he strained his eyes\r\nthrough the darkness, he could find nothing at which to shoot.\r\n\r\nFor a long time there was silence about the hut, and now for the\r\nfirst time Bomba permitted himself to hope that their foes had\r\nwithdrawn, for that night at least, and perhaps permanently. Their\r\nlosses had been serious. The threat of the battering ram had failed.\r\nPerhaps they had had enough of the contest.\r\n\r\nBut this conjecture had not thoroughly taken into account the\r\nresources and ingenuity of Nascanora.\r\n\r\nFrom the woods came something in a trail of flame, and the next\r\nmoment there was a soft thud in the logs that formed the wall.\r\n\r\nSeveral others followed in quick succession. And now the ground\r\nimmediately in front of the hut was streaked with flickering shafts\r\nof light that momentarily grew brighter.\r\n\r\nCasson was mystified.\r\n\r\n“What are they doing?” he asked wonderingly.\r\n\r\nBomba had been asking himself that question, too. And now the\r\nsolution came to him, and his heart sank.\r\n\r\n“They are arrows with fire in their tails,” he answered. “They are\r\ntrying to burn the hut.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment despair clutched their hearts. This was something on\r\nwhich they had not counted, something against which they had no way\r\nto fight.\r\n\r\nBomba’s first impulse was to dash outside the door and tear down the\r\nburning arrows. But he realized at once that this would be suicide.\r\nIn the light that came from the torches he would offer a perfect\r\ntarget and a dozen arrows would be buried in his body.\r\n\r\nNow the two within the hut heard an ominous crackling which told them\r\nthat the wall was catching fire. It grew louder and louder. It seemed\r\nto spell their doom.\r\n\r\nThey were in a fearful plight. If they stayed inside, they would be\r\nburned to death. If they rushed outside, nothing could save them from\r\nthe arrows of their invisible foes.\r\n\r\nInvisible! It was this that made Bomba grind his teeth in rage. He\r\nhad often faced death, but on those occasions he had seen his foes\r\nand had had his chance of selling his life dearly. Now even this poor\r\nprivilege would be denied him. He and Casson would be shot down with\r\nperfect impunity by the enemies behind the trees. Long before he\r\ncould reach them, he would have fallen.\r\n\r\nOther arrows with their fire trails had followed the first flight,\r\nand Bomba knew by the increasing light on the ground that the wall\r\nmust be studded with them.\r\n\r\nThe crackling now was becoming a roar, and Bomba could tell that the\r\nlogs themselves were afire. Spurts of flame began to creep through\r\nthe cracks, and the heat became unbearable.\r\n\r\nHe and Casson tried to beat out the interior blaze with boards, but\r\nfor every flame they extinguished a dozen more appeared. The wall had\r\nfairly caught, and the fire was beyond their control. The end seemed\r\nvery near.\r\n\r\nBomba mentally said farewell to life. It was hard to die right on the\r\nthreshold of life. All his dreams had faded. He would never see the\r\nwhite men again, never solve the mystery of his existence.\r\n\r\nTheir hands and faces now were blistered by the heat, and they were\r\nforced to retreat to the farther part of the hut. There was a little\r\nwater there, and they dashed it over them. Then they drenched some\r\ncloths that they wrapped around their necks and faces.\r\n\r\n“Bomba, my boy!” said Casson, in one of his rare expressions of\r\naffection. “I’m an old man, and weary. But you’re a lad and should\r\nlive on.” The old man went on, but now the words became mere\r\nmuttering.\r\n\r\nHope now was gone. They could not help themselves and there was none\r\nto help them.\r\n\r\nNone to help them?\r\n\r\nBomba started as though from an electric shock.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to one of the portholes and sent out a loud, long,\r\nundulating cry that rang weirdly through the jungle.\r\n\r\nAgain and again he repeated the cry with all the power of his lungs.\r\n\r\nIt was the call that he had used many times to summon his jungle\r\nfriends to his side, and they had always come!\r\n\r\nWould they come now?\r\n\r\nWould they face fire?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nIN THE NICK OF TIME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jungle beasts came in swarms!\r\n\r\nIn the distance could be heard something like the soughing of a great\r\nwind. It grew in volume until it swelled into a roar. Then the jungle\r\nabout the hut was alive with monkeys, scores of them, hundreds of\r\nthem, with every passing moment increasing their numbers.\r\n\r\nThey saw the burning hut, and sensed Bomba’s extremity. They saw the\r\nlurking savages, and realized that they were Bomba’s foes.\r\n\r\nThen there came pouring down from the trees a hail of the heavy\r\ncastanha nuts that felled whatever they struck.\r\n\r\nThe surviving savages fled, with wild screams, in a headlong rout.\r\nAnd their demoralization was complete when Polulu, with a tremendous\r\nroar, came bounding in upon them, his eyes glaring, his tail lashing,\r\nhis paws striking out like flails.\r\n\r\nBomba heard the shrieks of the affrighted savages, the jabbering of\r\nthe monkeys, and the roars of Polulu. His jungle friends had not\r\nfailed him. He and Casson were saved!\r\n\r\nWith smarting eyes he rushed to the door, threw off the heavy bar and\r\nswung the door wide.\r\n\r\nThen he ran back to Casson, who was in a half comatose condition,\r\npulled him to his feet and, half dragging, half lifting him,\r\nstaggered through the doorway and laid his burden under the trees.\r\n\r\nWhat blessed coolness was in the night air as Bomba drank it in\r\ndeep draughts! And what added delight came to him as he felt on his\r\nuplifted face the plashing of raindrops!\r\n\r\nCasson was now in a state of complete collapse, and Bomba was\r\nfrightened at the ashen pallor of the old man’s face. He rushed to\r\nthe river behind the cabin and brought water, with which he bathed\r\nCasson’s face. Then he chafed his wrists and slapped his hands, until\r\nthe naturalist opened his eyes with a feeble moan.\r\n\r\nThe monkeys were all excitement, and chattered their sympathy with\r\nCasson and their delight at Bomba’s escape. They would have come down\r\nand surrounded the pair, had it not been for the presence of Polulu,\r\nwho had returned from his pursuit of the savages and who now came up\r\nto Bomba and rubbed his great head against him.\r\n\r\nThen the puma stretched himself on the ground at a little distance,\r\nand Bomba knew as well as if he had been told that his faithful\r\nguardian was settled there for the night. Woe to any skulking savage\r\nwho might steal back there while Polulu was on guard!\r\n\r\nBut, as a matter of fact, there was no further attack to be\r\napprehended that night, nor for many more to come. The Indians had\r\npaid heavy toll. Five lay dead on the ground, and probably twice that\r\nnumber in wounded had crawled away into the forest or been carried\r\noff by their comrades.\r\n\r\nAt least half of the raiders had been incapacitated, and among the\r\nwounded had been Nascanora himself, and all the unwounded survivors\r\nwere at that moment rushing pell-mell through the jungle, frantically\r\neager to put as many miles as possible between themselves and the\r\ncabin, where the white man’s magic had been capped by the calling of\r\nthe jungle beasts to help.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Casson had been restored to consciousness and Bomba had\r\nbandaged his burns as well as he could, the lad turned his attention\r\nto the cabin.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing he could do that nature was not doing still\r\nbetter. The rain was now coming down in torrents. It deluged the\r\nburning front wall until the blaze died out and great clouds of steam\r\ntook its place.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the other three walls had caught in only a few places,\r\nand here, too, the flames were quickly extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe monkeys gradually dispersed after Bomba told them how grateful he\r\nwas for their help and promised to soon see them again.\r\n\r\nThe storm increased in violence, and Bomba helped Casson into the\r\nhut. The roof had held and the floor was dry. Bomba made the old man\r\nas comfortable as he could in one of the new hammocks he had brought\r\nwith him, and then crept into the other to get the rest he so badly\r\nneeded and had so richly earned.\r\n\r\nThe last thing he was conscious of, as he dropped off to sleep,\r\nwas that Polulu had come in and stretched his huge form across the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nBomba slept late, and when at last he opened his eyes the faithful\r\npuma had gone. He had stayed until all danger was over and then gone\r\nforth to his hunting.\r\n\r\nBomba himself was stiff and sore, but all concern for himself was\r\nquickly lost in his anxiety over Casson’s condition. The terrible\r\nexperience through which he had passed had been too much for the old\r\nnaturalist, and he was in a high fever. He did not recognize Bomba,\r\nand babbled incoherently in delirium. At intervals he would sink into\r\na stupor that would endure for hours, to be broken again by wild\r\ntossings and meaningless phrases.\r\n\r\nAt times the words “Bartow” and “Laura” would escape his lips, but\r\nthough Bomba listened eagerly for what would follow, nothing came\r\nthat made more clear for him the mystery in which he was enshrouded.\r\n\r\nThe boy nursed Casson assiduously, using the simple but effective\r\nremedies whose power he had learned from Candido, the half-witted\r\ncaboclo, and at the end of several days the fever broke.\r\n\r\nFrom then on Casson mended rapidly, and Bomba was delighted to note\r\nthat with returning strength his mind seemed less clouded. He had\r\nlost some of his apathy, and took a greater interest in the things\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nThe “door” was still closed, but he was trying harder to open it than\r\nhe had before. At times a flash of memory seemed to come to him, and\r\nhe would begin to speak eagerly, but before he had fairly framed a\r\nsentence the thought would elude him. At such times he was desperate,\r\nand would break out into a passion of weeping.\r\n\r\nOne day he called Bomba to him.\r\n\r\n“Bomba,” he said, laying his thin hand on the boy’s shoulder, “I have\r\ntried and tried to tell you what you have a right to know, but I\r\ncannot remember. Sometimes I almost recall it, and then it vanishes.\r\nBut there has come to me a name. There is someone who knows, and he\r\ncan tell you much, perhaps all.”\r\n\r\n“Who is it?” cried Bomba excitedly.\r\n\r\n“It is Jojasta,” replied Casson. “Mark well that name, Jojasta.”\r\n\r\n“I will never forget it,” said Bomba solemnly. “But what is he and\r\nwhere does he live?”\r\n\r\n“He is the Medicine Man of the Moving Mountain,” replied Casson.\r\n\r\n“The Moving Mountain?” repeated Bomba, in bewilderment. He had never\r\nheard the term before.\r\n\r\n“It is a long way off,” explained Casson. “And it is hard to reach.\r\nBut I will tell you how to get there. Yes, I know that now. But the\r\nother is too far away. That I cannot recall. Through Jojasta is the\r\nonly way you can find out what you want to know, what you ought to\r\nknow. You must go.”\r\n\r\nHow Bomba went there, the fearful perils he met, and the obstacles\r\nhe surmounted on the way, will be told in the next volume of this\r\nseries, entitled: “Bomba, the Jungle Boy, at the Moving Mountain; or,\r\nThe Mystery of the Caves of Fire.”\r\n\r\nCasson sank back exhausted, and Bomba knew there was nothing more to\r\nbe told just then. But what he had heard filled him with hope.\r\n\r\nHe must tell his friends and let them share his joy. He took\r\nhis harmonica and strayed off into the jungle, playing a dreamy,\r\nplaintive tune.\r\n\r\nSoon his jungle friends of the air and treetops were all about him,\r\nKiki, Woowoo, Doto, and scores of others. He smiled at them, talked\r\nand played for them. He was in a joyous, exhilarated mood, and they\r\nwere glad for Bomba’s sake.\r\n\r\n“You are all my friends,” he cried. “You helped Bomba when the men\r\nwith bad hearts came to the cabin. Bomba loves you all. He does not\r\nwant to leave you, but he must go. He will always think of you, and\r\nsome day he may come back to you. But Bomba must go. He must find the\r\nmen who have souls, the souls that are awake. For Bomba has a soul.\r\nAnd he must find the white men. For Bomba is white.”\r\n\r\nHe tore the puma skin aside and displayed his chest.\r\n\r\n“Look, Woowoo! Look, Kiki! Look, Doto!” he cried, in an ecstasy of\r\njoy and pride. “Look, all of you! I will tell Polulu, too. I am\r\nwhite! Bomba is white!”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n  _Dear Reader_:\r\n\r\n  If you have enjoyed this story and wish to follow the further\r\n  adventures of BOMBA, you may do so in the books listed on the\r\n  following page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOMBA BOOKS\r\n\r\nBy ROY ROCKWOOD\r\n\r\n_12mo.
