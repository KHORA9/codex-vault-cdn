PRINTERS,\r\n Old Fishmarket, Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{v} PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be thought presumptuous in a person who has never had the\r\ncuriosity to peruse the British classic authors on planting and\r\ntimber—EVELYN, HANBURY, MARSHALL, MILLER, PONTEY—to make experiment of\r\nthe public sufferance. The author does not, however, think any apology\r\nnecessary; as, if the public lose time unprofitably over his pages, he\r\nconsiders the blame attachable to them, not to him. A writer does not\r\nobtrude as a speaker does, but merely places his thoughts within reach.\r\n\r\nAs the subject, notwithstanding its great importance, might, _per se_,\r\nbe felt dry and {vi} insipid by the general reader, accustomed to the\r\nluxuries of modern literature, the author has not scrupled to mix with\r\nit such collateral matter as he thought might serve to correct the\r\naridity. The very great interest of the question regarding species,\r\nvariety, habit, has perhaps led him a little too wide.\r\n\r\nThere is one advantage in taking a subject of this kind, that few\r\nprofessional (literary) critics can meddle with it, further than as\r\nregards style and language, without exposing their own ignorance. Yet\r\nwill the author experience the highest pleasure in being instructed\r\nand corrected, wherever his knowledge may be found defective, or\r\nwhen speculation or misconception of facts have led him into error.\r\nKnowledge and truth, is mental strength and health; ignorance and\r\nerror, weakness and {vii} disease: the man who pursues science for its\r\nown sake, and not for the pride of possession, will feel more gratitude\r\ntowards the surgeon who dislodges a cataract from the mind’s eye, than\r\ntowards the one who repairs the defect of the bodily organ.\r\n\r\n GOURDIE-HILL BY

It is by the\r\njar and struggle of the conflict that the baser alloy and rust of our\r\nmanners and institutions must be removed and rubbed away: it is by the\r\n{4} ennobling excitement of danger and of hardship that our generous\r\npassions must be cherished, and our youth led to emulate the Roman in\r\npatriotic thirst for glory—the Spartan in devotion—their own ancestor,\r\nthe more daring Scandinavian sea-king or rover[3], in adventurous\r\nvalour. Without, however, seeking the fight, yet in preparation for\r\nthe perhaps not distant time, when we shall face another foe, it\r\nbehoves us, without any sickly sentimentality, to cherish our warlike\r\nvirtues—above all things to attend to what must constitute “the field\r\nof our fame,” _Our_ MARINE, and the material of its construction,\r\n_Naval Timber_.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDNOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n[1] See App. A.\r\n\r\n[2] See App. B.\r\n\r\n[3] See App. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{5} PART I.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF VESSELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVessels are constructed of wood under two forms, _Plank_ and _Timbers_;\r\nPlank, the out and inside skin of the vessel—Timbers, the ribs or frame\r\nwhich support the plank.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I. PLANK.\r\n\r\nTrees intended for plank ought to be reared in close forest, or\r\nprotected situation, drawn tall and straight, or what is preferable\r\nfor a part, with a gentle regular bend, technically _sny_, Figs. v\r\nand x, (next page). It requires to be of clean solid texture, from 12\r\nto 40 feet in length, and at least 8 inches in diameter at small end,\r\nor any greater thickness. For the conveniency of transport, oak plank\r\ntimber is generally squared or planked where grown, and is cut out from\r\n2 1/2 to 7 inches in thickness, and from 6 to 18 inches in breadth.\r\nPlank is needed of such various dimensions, that any oak tree of clean\r\ntimber, nearly straight one way, and straight, or with a gentle regular\r\nbending, the other, may safely be cut into plank, the section to be\r\nin the plane of the {6} curve. Figs. v, x, y, z, represent the most\r\nadvantageous forms of logs for cutting into plank. The dotted lines\r\nshew the section of the saw in planking: the straighter the log is\r\nin the plane of the saw, it is the more suitable, as the planks bend\r\nsufficiently _side_-way by steaming; Fig. v, of considerable bend and\r\ntaper, where the planks, when cut, have a bend _edge_-way, is the most\r\nvaluable: this form requires to be very free of knots. In straight\r\nplanks, Fig. z, cleanness from knots is not such a desideratum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. z, y, of any length—best long; x, from 25 to 35\r\nfeet; v, v, from 12 to 24 feet.\r\n\r\nIn the above cut, for distinctness, the saw is drawn entering the butt.\r\nIn practice it enters the top.]\r\n\r\nWhen planks are cut out where grown, they are sawn from the round\r\nlog immediately after it is {7} felled and barked, which not only\r\nprevents injury from drought-cracks, but produces also a considerable\r\nsaving of timber and labour, as the wood is softer when green; and\r\nthe centre planks can thus be had much broader than after squaring\r\nthe log. The outer part of the matured or red wood, which is partly\r\ncut away in squaring, is also the cleanest for bending. The sap or\r\nnot sufficiently matured wood, when left on the side of the plank\r\nin the vessel, wherever it is not always soaking in water, is only\r\nuseful to the shipwright, as it decays in two or three years, and\r\ndemands an expensive repair. When plank timber is squared, it is for\r\nthe conveniency of carriage and stowage, and where timber is of little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nOf British trees suited for plank, the most valuable are oak, Spanish\r\nchesnut, larch, red wood pine, and sometimes beech[4], elm, plane\r\n(_Acer pseudo-platanus_) under water. As no timber decays under water\r\nfor a considerable length of time, when put in fresh, unless it be\r\ndevoured by the sea-worm, beech or any other hard tough wood is nearly\r\nequally good as oak for outside plank under light water-mark, provided\r\nthe timber be hastened out of the bush into the vessel, or be kept in\r\npools, either in log or {8} plank, till used, or be planked, and the\r\nplank kept dry under cover. One summer on the ground will generally\r\nrender a beech log in the bark useless.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS[5] FOR TRAINING PLANK TIMBER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDivide all branches into leaders and feeders; leaders, the main or\r\nsuperior shoots which tend to become stems, A, _a_, _a_; feeders, the\r\ninferior branches, B, _b_, _b_, _b_. {9}\r\n\r\nShould more than one leader appear from the time of planting the tree\r\ntill it attain the required height for the plank, shorten all but the\r\nmost promising one down to the condition of feeders, making the section\r\nimmediately above a twig, preferring one which takes a lateral or\r\nhorizontal direction. Vide dotted line crossing _a_, _a_.\r\n\r\nShould any feeder, below the required height, become enlarged beyond\r\nits compeers, such as B, reduce it to equality (_vide_ dotted line), or\r\nprune it close off, if this should be necessary to the symmetry of the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nCut off, close by the trunk, all shoots which rise at a very acute\r\nangle with the main stem, such as C. There is a triple reason for this:\r\nthey rise up and interfere with the more regular horizontal feeders,\r\ntending also to become leaders; they do not form a proper junction with\r\nthe stem, by reason of the wood, as it swells, not being able to throw\r\nup the bark out of the narrow angle; thence the bark of both stem and\r\nbranch is enclosed in the confined breek, and the wood never unites[6],\r\nthence disease is {10} liable to be generated between them, or the\r\nbranches are subject to be torn down by the wind; and should they\r\nultimately come to be removed, being then of considerable size, and\r\nthe section from their perpendicular position being partly horizontal,\r\nas the sides of the wound swell up, the rain lodges in the centre, and\r\ngenerates rot. These nearly perpendicular branches generally originate\r\nfrom improper pruning, springing out where a large branch has been cut\r\naway.\r\n\r\nLop off all branches, which, by taking an irregular direction, incline\r\nto rub upon the more regular; also remove all splintered, twisted, and\r\ndiseased branches.\r\n\r\nDo not cut away any of the lower branches (feeders) till they become\r\nsickly or dead. By pruning these prematurely, you destroy the fine\r\nbalance of nature, and throw too much vigour into the top, which in\r\nconsequence puts forth a number of leaders. You also diminish the\r\ngrowth of the tree by the loss of healthy feeders; the timber of the\r\ntree increasing in proportion to the quantity of healthy branches\r\nand foliage (the foliage being the stomach and lungs {11} of the\r\nplant). You also, by diminishing the number of feeders, increase the\r\ncomparative size of those remaining, which throws the upper part of\r\nthe stem into large knots, improper for plank, and renders then future\r\nexcision dangerous, as large feeders, when circumstance or decay\r\nrequire their removal, or, when they are rifted off by winds or snow,\r\nleave wounds which often carry corruption into the core of the tree.\r\n\r\nAfter the tree has acquired a sufficient height of bole for plank, say\r\nfrom 20 to 60 feet, according to circumstance of exposure, climate,\r\n&c., and also as many branches above this height as may be thought\r\nnecessary to carry on advantageously the vital functions, as the\r\nsuperior head will now sustain small injury by being thrown out into\r\nlarge branches and plurality of leaders, (if it be oak it will become\r\nmore valuable by affording a number of small crooks and knees); it\r\nwill then be proper, in order to have timber as clean as possible, and\r\nregularly flexible, to lop clean off all the branches on the stem as\r\nfar up as this required height. From the early attention to procure\r\nvery numerous feeders, and to prevent any from attaining large size,\r\nthe wounds will very soon be closed over, leaving no external scar, and\r\nas little as possible of internal knot or breaking off of {12} fibre.\r\nThere are many salves, panaceæ, and pigments in use for covering over\r\nthe section of removed branches, which in ordinary cases may occasion\r\nno injury, but they are unsightly. In wounds of beech trees where the\r\ncut tubes are so prone to die downward a considerable way into the stem\r\nand to generate rot, an antiseptic quickly-drying pigment might be\r\nbeneficial. This and the time of the season for pruning, at which the\r\ncut tubes or fibres are least liable to die inward, deserve attention.\r\nWe consider the spring the least dangerous time. Should a number of\r\nsmall shoots spring out in consequence of this last pruning, they may\r\nbe swept down if good plank be desired; if not, they may remain, as\r\ntheir presence will not greatly injure the plank, and they occasion the\r\nstem to thicken considerably faster where they grow: yet it is probable\r\nthat, in doing this, by obstructing the flow of the sap downwards, they\r\nmay interfere with the natural enlargement of the roots, and ultimately\r\nbe injurious. Some varieties, or rather some individuals of oak, are\r\nmuch more prone to this sprouting upon the bole after pruning than\r\nothers; where the disposition exists in a great degree it ought to be\r\nencouraged, and the tree set apart for the construction of cabinet\r\nwork. {13}\r\n\r\nThis system of pruning—encouraging numerous feeders and one leader\r\nwhile the tree is young, and of allowing or rather inducing the\r\nbranches, after the tree has acquired sufficient height, to spread\r\nout into a horizontal top, is in harmony with, and only humouring the\r\nnatural disposition of trees, and is therefore both seemly and of easy\r\npractice[7]. The perfection of naval forest economy would consist in\r\nsuperadding (according to instructions to be given on training of\r\ntimbers) a top of which every branch is a valuable bend or knee, though\r\nin consequence of the situation the timber will be fragile, and of\r\nlight porous texture.\r\n\r\n_In pruning and educating for plank timber, the whole art consists\r\nin training the tree as much as possible, and with as little loss of\r\nbranch as possible, to one leader and numerous feeders, and to the\r\nregular cone figure which the pine tribe naturally assumes._ This can\r\nbe best and most easily performed by timely attention—checking every\r\nover-luxuriant, overshadowing branch and wayward shoot on its first\r\nappearance; so that none of the feeders which spring forth at first\r\nmay be smothered, till {14} they in turn become lowermost; and by the\r\ninfluence of rather close plantation, which of itself will perform in a\r\nnatural manner all that we have been teaching by art, and will perform\r\nit well. This closeness must, however, be very guardedly employed, and\r\ntimeously prevented from proceeding too far, otherwise the complete\r\nruin of the forest, by premature decay or winds, may ensue, especially\r\nwhen it consists of pines. Of course all kinds of pines require no\r\nother attention than this (well-timed thinning), and to have their\r\nsickly moss covered under branches swept clean down.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II. TIMBERS.\r\n\r\nTimbers, as before stated, are the ribs of the vessel, spreading out\r\nand upward (excepting at the bow and stern) at right angles to the\r\nkeel and keelson, two large straight logs which form a double spinal\r\nsupport or backbone. The ribs or compass timbers in great public\r\nbuilding establishments are sometimes bent by machinery, after being\r\nsoftened by steam or hot liquids[8]; and for this purpose the {15}\r\ncleanest straightest wood is requisite. We, however, do not believe\r\nthat pieces of great diameter, bent artificially, can have equal\r\nstrength and resilience as when grown bent—the fibre must in some\r\ndegree be crippled. We admit that timbers and frames may be built of\r\nseparate bended pieces of no great thickness, and have all the strength\r\nand resilience of natural bend: the strongest and most elastic mode of\r\nforming vessels would be to compose them of different layers of plank\r\nover each other in diagonal fashion, or at an angle 60°, but the labour\r\nand inconveniency of these modes would be great. We will not admit that\r\nan experiment between the strength of a piece of coarse cross-grained\r\ntimber, half naturally bent, half cut out of the solid, and that of a\r\npiece of clean timber artificially bent, is any proof on the subject.\r\nLet us produce a clean natural bend, exactly fitted to its place,\r\nwithout any section of fibre, and make experiment with it. But at any\r\nrate, as this plan (bending of timbers) has never been adopted to any\r\nextent in our private building-yards, we must doubt its economy,—either\r\n{16} that the practice is of no considerable advantage, or that the\r\nrequisite machinery is too expensive for private establishments, and\r\nconclude that fine bent timber still continues a necessary in the\r\nformation of at least our mercantile marine.\r\n\r\nOf the very ingenious innovations in the structure of vessels contrived\r\nby Sir R. SEPPINGS, by which knees and crooked timber might nearly\r\nbe superseded, we can only say, the practice is not followed, and,\r\nat least in private building-yards, not likely to be so;—that the\r\ndemand for fine crooked timber, comparatively, is, and will continue\r\nto be, as great as ever. Should our war navy, from the introduction\r\nof steam impulse and bomb cannon, be reduced to fleets of strong\r\ngun-boats, the demand for crooked timber, instead of lessening, will\r\ngreatly increase,—the building of frames of straight timber being more\r\nexpensive, and less suitable, in small than in large vessels; and\r\nshould war occur, in the hurry of the formation of a new war navy under\r\na different principle, the speediest and simplest mode of construction\r\nwill be followed.\r\n\r\nNearly two-thirds of the timbers of a vessel consist of the curves and\r\nbends _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_; the other third is of straighter\r\ntimber, and easily obtained. {17} All timbers require to be straight\r\nin one way—in the plane of their side, and the sides generally to be\r\nsquare. The under measures embrace timbers of appropriate size for\r\nvessels from 50 to 500 tons register; it is seldom that merchantmen are\r\nrequired under or above this size. Of course, large war-vessels require\r\ntimbers of larger dimension. The corresponding timbers of vessels of\r\ndifferent size are nearly similar figures, and the length of their\r\nrespective lines not far from being in the ratio of the cube root of\r\nthe tonnage—a little deeper and thicker in the smaller vessels. When\r\ntimbers are formed of larch or pine, they require to be a little more\r\nin diameter than when of oak. {18}\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n Fig. _a_, Flat floor, from 9 1/2 to 18 feet long (that is, 9 1/2\r\n for a vessel of 50 tons, and 18 for one of 500), and from 9 to 16\r\n inches deep at middle; thickness 1/4th less than depth, the diameter\r\n increasing in proportion to the length. When fillings such as _s_ are\r\n used, flat floors are cut from straight logs.\r\n\r\n _b_, Rising floor shorter, and same depth and thickness as former.\r\n\r\n _c_, _c_, High rising floors, from 4 to 8 feet in length of wing, and\r\n a little deeper, and same thickness as former. From the difficulty\r\n of procuring this bend, the wings are often used of unequal length,\r\n according as the timber turns out, the shorter wing to exceed 3 feet,\r\n and more when of considerable diameter. Floors are of every rise from\r\n _a_ to _c_, being flattest at midships, and rising gradually as they\r\n approach the bow and stern. In all timbers, it is necessary, for\r\n strength, that the fibre of the wood extend from one end to the other\r\n without much cross grain. See lines on high rising floor, _c_.\r\n\r\n _d_, First foot-hook, from 7 to 13 feet long, and from 7 to 14 inches\r\n deep; thickness 1/5th less than depth.\r\n\r\n _e_, Second foot-hook, from 6 to 10 feet long, and from 6 to 13\r\n inches deep, thickness 1/6th less than depth. This curve, when of\r\n great size, is valuable as, breast-hooks—curved timbers stretching\r\n horizontally within and at right angles to the bow-timbers, to support\r\n the bow.\r\n\r\n _f_, _f_, _f_, Knees, the one wing nearly at right angles to the\r\n other; from 2 to 9 feet in length of wing; depth at middle as much\r\n as possible; thickness from 4 to 12 inches,—generally required about\r\n 3 1/2 feet in length of wing, and from 6 to 8 inches thick. Knees,\r\n when large, suit for high rising floors.\r\n\r\n Fig. _h_ is a valuable piece, and easily procured by bending the young\r\n plant; when cut, it forms two second foot-hooks.\r\n\r\n Figs. _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, are suitable, though the part cut off\r\n by the dotted line be awanting. In good work, this plan is often\r\n followed, and a cross-chock put on. (Vid. _s_, left side of the\r\n cross-section of a vessel thus timbered, page 20). By this {19} mode\r\n of building, vessels can be constructed from much straighter timber,\r\n and the vessels are superior, from being more elastic; but from the\r\n nicety and expense of the work and waste of timber, the practice is\r\n not much in use. {20}]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cross-section of a Vessel at midships—knees not\r\n inserted.]\r\n\r\nA first foot-hook alternates with each floor, and second foot-hook,\r\nalongside, extending from _o_ to _q_; and a top-timber, or third\r\nfoot-hook, alternates alongside of each second foot-hook, and chock\r\nextending from _q_ to _a_. These timbers are bolted together, and\r\nconstitute a frame or double rib; and the skeleton is composed of a\r\nseries of double ribs (several inches separate, of course wider above\r\nthan lower down, as the timbers decrease in thickness), to within a\r\nlittle of the bow and stern, where the timbers are usually placed\r\nsingly, without framing. {21} In large vessels a fourth futtock is\r\nused; thence straighter timber is suitable.\r\n\r\nThe knees occupy the position at _x_, stretching horizontally along the\r\ninside of the vessel and end of the beams.\r\n\r\nOf British trees, timbers are formed of oak, Spanish chestnut,\r\nlarch, red-wood pine, red-wood willow (the stags-head ozier, _Salix\r\nfragilis_), and sometimes the broad-leafed elm (_Ulmus montana_) under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn Britain, crooked oak for timbers is found chiefly in hedge-rows and\r\nopen forests, where the winds, casual injury, or overhanging superior\r\nbranches, have thrown the tree, while young, from its natural balance;\r\nor, by the tree, from open situation, or excision of lower branches,\r\nparting early into several leaders, which, in receding from each other,\r\nform curves and angular bends. On the Continent of Europe, in the\r\nnatural forest, it is chiefly the tops of old lofty trees which afford\r\nthe crooks; in consequence, those we import are, for the most part, of\r\na free, light, insufficient quality[9]. {22}\r\n\r\nTo procure a sufficiency of excellent crooks, every person who has\r\nthe charge of young plantations of timber intended for naval purposes,\r\nought, in the more exposed situations not favourable to the growth of\r\nplank timber, or timber for bending, when the plants are from 3 to\r\n15 feet high, to mark out the most healthy, suitably formed plants,\r\nsufficiently close to fill the ground when of the proper size, say 6\r\nyards apart, and to bend these, as the under figures will illustrate.\r\nThe dotted portion is the growth after being bent. {23}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. _f._]\r\n\r\nThe bend of floors requiring to be at the middle, and of angular bend,\r\nsee Fig. _f_, young trees of one-half the required length, should have\r\nthe earth removed from the bulb of the root, from one or both sides,\r\naccording to circumstances, and the tree and stool partially upset to\r\nwindward, that is, generally south-west; (the operator, in effecting\r\nthis, may be assisted by a strong pronged instrument); then fixed in\r\nthis inclined position, and the earth filled in. This inclination may\r\nbe given at planting, when the plants are tall.\r\n\r\nThe best mode of securing the larger plants in their bent position,\r\nis by rods, forked or hooked at one end, the other end nailed to a\r\nground-stake;—the upper end, if forked, firmly tied to the bent plant\r\nby mat or straw rope. Smaller plants may be secured to the notched\r\ntops of stakes by ligatures; and the smallest, particularly larch,\r\npinned down by small stakes with hooked tops. Advantage may also be\r\ntaken of an adjacent tree of small value, and which would ultimately\r\nbe required to be thinned out, to tie the bended standard down to the\r\nmost convenient part of its top or stem, lopping off all above the\r\nligature, if it interfere with the standard, and barking it near the\r\nground, to prevent much future growth. When the workmen comprehend {24}\r\nthe required bends, they will fall upon methods of fixing the plants\r\nin the most suitable position, better adapted to the locality than\r\nany directions can teach. The plants will require to be fixed down at\r\nleast two years, and bent a little more than what is requisite, as in\r\ntheir after-growth they have generally a tendency to become straighter,\r\nfrom depositing the thickest layers in the hollow of the bend. A\r\nfine regular curve may be obtained by bending the plant for several\r\nsuccessive years, a little lower every year; this gradual lowering\r\ndoes not so much check the growth of the leader, nor tend so much to\r\ncause the feeders upon the upper side to push as leaders. When oaks are\r\nbent, great attention must be paid to cut away any ground-shoots, and\r\nto cut off or twist down any strong feeders that stand perpendicular\r\non the upper side of the tree; and also for several years afterwards,\r\nto look over the trees twice a-year, correcting any exuberant feeder,\r\nand destroying root-shoots. The forester ought to keep in mind that his\r\npupils are proverbially pliant, and that, should his growing timber\r\nnot be of the most valuable and most appropriate figure, he must rank\r\neither with the negligent or the incapable.\r\n\r\nShip timbers being generally required of greater depth than thickness,\r\nthat is, broadest in the plane {25} of the curve, hedge-row is better\r\nadapted to growing them than the forest, especially when the trees are\r\nclose in the row. The bend generally takes place across the row; and\r\nthe bole of the tree acquires a greater diameter in that direction than\r\nin the line of the row. If the figure of the top of a tree be very\r\nelliptical in the horizontal plane, the cross section of the bole,\r\ninstead of being circular, will also be elliptical (cake-grown). The\r\nlateral spread of the roots in thick planted rows being greater than\r\nthe longitudinal, also tends to give elliptic bole, the stem swelling\r\nmost on the sides where the strongest roots enter, which, of course,\r\nalways occurs on the sides affording most nourishment. Forests intended\r\nfor ship timbers might be planted and kept in rows a considerable\r\ndistance apart, with the plants close in the row, and thus acquire the\r\nelliptic bole. This would also facilitate the bending; by being turned\r\na little right and left alternately, they would spontaneously, from the\r\nweight of the top, and their inclination to avoid the shade of each\r\nother, increase the original bias. Were forests planted in close double\r\nrows, the plants thick in the row, with wide avenues or glades between,\r\nmany of the trees would acquire crooked boles, and the crooked might be\r\nretained when thinning. Avenues of this description {26} would form\r\nagreeable diversity from the monotonous irregularity of the forest, and\r\nbe highly picturesque.\r\n\r\nWere close triple rows planted with wide glades between, having spruce,\r\nlarch, birch, or other trees of more rapid growth than the oak in the\r\nmid row, and oak in the side rows, the greater part of the oak would be\r\nthrown out into fine curves by the overshadowing top of the superior\r\ntree. After the oak had received a sufficient side bias, the central\r\nrow, which of those kinds comes soon to be of value, might be removed.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to procure good oak knees is to look out in hedge-row\r\nand open forest for plants which divide into two or four leaders,\r\nfrom 3 to 10 feet above ground; and should the leaders not diverge\r\nsufficiently, to train them as horizontally as possible for several\r\nfeet, by rods stretching across the top, or by fixing them down by\r\nstakes; see following figures. Figs. _a_, _b_, _f_, are drawn to a\r\nsmaller scale than _c_, _d_; of course, a stem, after dividing, never\r\nextends in length below the division. {27}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen grown, the main stem, either used whole, sawn in two, or\r\nquartered, will form one wing of the knee, and the bent branch the\r\nother; see figs. _c_, _d_. The dotted lines shew the saw section.\r\nParticular attention must be paid to prevent oaks from separating\r\ninto more than four leaders, and also to train up these leaders a\r\nconsiderable height, without allowing them to divide again, retaining\r\nalways numerous feeders; thus, when the tree acquires size, {28} many\r\nvaluable crooks _g_, _h_, _i_, will be formed above the knees. It is\r\nnecessary, however, to guard against training the branches to too great\r\na height, as, when so, they run much risk of being twisted and torn by\r\nhigh winds.\r\n\r\nKnees may also be obtained by cropping the top from plants that have\r\nside branches similar to _f_, and training these branches for leaders\r\nas above directed. In this case, the section, where the top is cut\r\noff, must not be too large, and the branches, either two or four,\r\nwell knotted to the trunk, or the situation sheltered, otherwise the\r\ntrunk at the section may be split down by the strain of the wind on\r\nthe new leaders. Also, in healthy growing trees of considerable size,\r\nwhich have spreading tops, and which are not to be cut down for a\r\nconsiderable time, the forester, if he have a good eye, may, by lopping\r\noff a few branches here and there throughout the top, throw the greater\r\npart of the boughs into condition to become knees, or valuable crooks,\r\nwhen of size. This is of most material consequence to the ultimate\r\nvalue of half-grown oak trees, in open situations, and ought to be\r\nparticularly studied by the superintendent, as, when allowed to run\r\ninto very numerous _stemmy_ branches, without direction or curtailment,\r\nthe top, instead of being ultimately of {29} considerable value\r\nas timber, is of none. Directions in writing will scarcely suffice\r\nto teach a forester this part of his business; he must consider\r\nattentively the knee figures and bends we have furnished, fix them in\r\nhis memory, and use every eligible means to obtain them. Knees, of all\r\ndescriptions of oak timber are in the greatest request. We have known\r\nthem purchased at 7s. per computed solid foot, which, from the plan\r\nof measuring, is as much as 10s. per real solid foot. The prevailing\r\ninattention to judicious training will continue to occasion the supply\r\nof knees to be short of the demand, and thence the price high, provided\r\nsome change does not take place in the structure of vessels, or iron\r\nknees be adopted, which are now sometimes used, or vessels, with the\r\nexception of the deck and rigging, be formed of iron altogether, which\r\nwe have seen do very well in inland navigation.\r\n\r\nAs crooked round oak timber of the natural length is extremely\r\nunmanageable, and its distant transport very expensive, it is desirable\r\nthat it be squared and cut in lengths suited to its ultimate use, where\r\ngrown. This requires a thorough knowledge of the necessary curves, to\r\nwhich the figs. p. 19, will afford considerable assistance. However,\r\nthe superintendent of any extensive fall of naval timber either should\r\nbe {30} a shipwright who has had practice in lining off timbers, or\r\nshould have passed several months in a dock-yard during the timbering\r\nof vessels, observing every piece that is put to use.\r\n\r\nAs most part of the timbers of a vessel have their sides squared, the\r\ncutter cannot err much in hewing away the sides in the plane of, and at\r\nright angles to, the curves, at least as deep as the sap-wood reaches,\r\nthus leaving only a little sap-wood on the angles; the sap-wood, in\r\nall cases (except in those small craft used in carrying lime, which\r\npreserves from rot), being worse than useless; by its decay not only\r\nweakening the vessel from the want of entireness of the timbers, but\r\nalso acting as a ferment to further corruption.\r\n\r\nIn our directions for obtaining curved and angular bent timbers, we\r\nmay be thought to have been a little too minute with the dimensions\r\nand figures: under the hand of the shipwright, or person of skill, a\r\ntree of almost any possible bend cuts out to valuable purpose: what\r\nis wanted is crooked timber, free of large knots;—first and second\r\nfoot-hooks and knees are, however, most in demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDNOTES TO PART I.\r\n\r\n[4] Beech, suited for plank, is sometimes of more value when straight\r\nand of considerable length for the purposes of keel-pieces; for this\r\nthe log requires to be from 30 to 70 feet in length, and at least of\r\nsufficient thickness at the small end to square a foot.\r\n\r\n[5] These directions are generally applicable—as well for what may be\r\nrequired for being bent for compass-timbers, and for what may be used\r\nfor land purposes, as for plank.\r\n\r\n[6] There are several valuable varieties of apple-trees of acute branch\r\nangle, which do not throw up the hark of the breeks; this either\r\noccasions the branches to split down when loaded with fruit, or, if\r\nthey escape this for a few years, the confined bark becomes putrid,\r\nand produces canker, which generally ruins the tree. We have remedied\r\nthis by a little attention in assisting the rising of the bark with\r\nthe knife. Nature must not be charged with the malformation of these\r\nvarieties; at least, had she formed them, as soon as she saw her error\r\nshe would have blotted out her work.\r\n\r\n[7] Commencing by times, the greater part of training and pruning for\r\nplank, excepting in the case of dead branches, fractures, and last\r\npruning, may be performed by a small knife.\r\n\r\n[8] We are not in possession of sufficient facts to judge of the effect\r\nto hasten or deter decay occasioned by the timber having been softened\r\nin hot liquids of 212° or upwards, and not raised so high as to\r\ngenerate pyrolignous acid; but we think it must impair the elasticity.\r\n\r\n[9] As excellent plank can be obtained by importation, the grower\r\nof naval timber ought to regard the production of crooks as a more\r\npatriotic occupation than the production of plank. _It will generally\r\npay better._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{31} PART II.\r\n\r\nBRITISH FOREST TREES USED AS NAVAL TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOAK—_Quercus_.\r\n\r\nOak appears to be the most prevalent tree about the middle of the\r\nnorth temperate zone, growing, naturally, upon almost every soil,\r\nexcepting some of the sterile sandy hats. With the exception of the\r\npines, it is by far the most useful kind of tree, almost balancing\r\nthe accommodating figure of stem, and manageable quality of the pine\r\ntimber, by its greater strength and durability, and excelling the\r\npines in value of bark. It is not easy to determine whether there be\r\ndistinct British species in the genus _Quercus_; but, at least, there\r\nare several breeds, or families, or grouped resemblances, which,\r\nthough the individuals may slightly vary, and though a gradation, or\r\nconnection, may be traced among these families themselves, yet possess\r\ngeneral character sufficiently marked to support names. Botanists, who\r\nare so prompt and so well prepared with their classes, {32} orders,\r\ngenera, species, varieties, long before they acquire much knowledge\r\nof what they are so ready to classify, or be able to distinguish\r\nbetween species and variety, or know if species and variety be really\r\ndistinct, divide the oak of this country into two species, _Quercus\r\nRobur_ and _Q. sessiliflora_, the former with long fruit-stalks,\r\nand hard, strong, durable timber, the late leafing old kind once so\r\nprevalent in the island: the latter an earlier leafing, faster growing\r\nkind, timber inferior, leaves petiolate, fruit sessile, not common,\r\nbut supposed native. We consider there is no foundation for this\r\nspecific distinction; we have met with oaks with various lengths of\r\nfruit-stalks: Besides, short and long fruit-stalks is a very common\r\ndifference among seedling varieties. The families or breeds which we\r\nhave observed in the indigenous oak resemble what are found among\r\nalmost every kind of vegetable, and graduate into each other,—those\r\nfarthest removed in appearance, no doubt having power to commix by the\r\npollen. The most remarkable distinction we have observed is in the\r\ncolour of the bark, whether inclining to white or black. The variety\r\nor breed with grey white bark, often very smooth and shining, and\r\nsometimes beautifully clouded with green, has also a different form\r\nof leaf and figure of top from those with {33} blackish bark, and we\r\nhave no doubt will also afford a different quality of timber. Those\r\nwith blackish dingy bark vary considerably from each other, some being\r\nof very luxuriant growth and heavy foliage, with thick fleshy bark,\r\naffording much tannin; others, though in favourable situation, of\r\nstunted growth, thin dry bark, and delicate constitution, often being\r\nnipped in the twigs by the frost: some having a round easy figure of\r\ntop, even with pendulous branching, others extremely stiff and angular\r\nin the branching; some with the most elegant foliage, deeply sinuated\r\nand finely waved, others with the clumsiest, most misshapen foliage,\r\nalmost as if opposite principles had presided at their forming. We have\r\nobserved the earlier kinds, with the dark bark, to have generally the\r\neasiest figure of top; the angular branching and stiffness of figure\r\nof top being greatest in those sooty-barked late kinds, most disposed\r\nto take two growths in the season, the spring and autumnal, which,\r\nfrom the proneness of these kinds to be affected in the terminal bud\r\nby monstrosities, and sometimes also to be nipped in the point of\r\nthe unripened autumn shoot by the frost, are generally thrown out in\r\ndifferent directions, the tree, from these causes, growing awkwardly\r\nand irregularly, and by fits and starts.\r\n\r\nBesides the indigenous _Quercus Robur_, we have {34} a number of\r\nkinds, termed distinct species, growing in Britain, of foreign\r\nderivation—the Turkish oak, _Quercus Cerris_; the Lucombe oak, _Q.\r\nsempervirens_; the scarlet-leaved American, _Q. coccinea_; the\r\nevergreen, _Q. Ilex_, and several others. The Turkish and Lucombe\r\nresemble each other, but the latter generally continues green till the\r\nspring, when the old leaves wither, a little before the young appear:\r\nBotanists make them varieties. We consider the Turkish oak the most\r\nvaluable and elegant of these foreign kinds. The leaves are generally\r\nvery long and slender, deeply and widely sinuated, and the teeth\r\nor salient angles sometimes undulated, having a curled appearance;\r\nyet there are some individuals with broad, short, flat leaves, not\r\ndiffering in figure from those of the common oak, but the tree in other\r\nrespects not different from the Turkish, being easily distinguished\r\nfrom the common oak by the reddish hairy appearance of the developing\r\nshoot, the scales of the bud having a hair-like extension, visible in\r\neach leaf axilla. The acorns are also bristled like echini, with this\r\nscaly prolongation. The timber is tough and clean, resembling the white\r\nAmerican, and suitable for staves. The stem and branches are generally\r\nvery straight, as the terminal bud seldom fails, and the growing\r\nproceeds steadily, without much autumnal shoot. {35}\r\n\r\nAs oaks run more hazard in transplanting than most other kinds of\r\ntrees, the greater care is necessary in procuring well-rooted,\r\nshort, vigorous plants; in having the soil free of stagnating water,\r\nin timing and executing the work in a proper manner, and in hoeing\r\naround the plant, keeping the ground clean and friable on the surface\r\nduring the first two or three seasons. As young oaks grow much more\r\nvigorously under considerable closeness and shelter, and as the plants\r\nare expensive, it is proper to plant, along with them, a mixture of\r\ncheaper plants, larches or other pines, which also sooner come to be\r\nof a little value, to be removed gradually as the young wood thickens\r\nup. In bleak exposed situations, it is well to plant the ground first\r\nwith pines, and when these attain a height of 6 or 8 feet, to cut out\r\na number, not in lines, but irregularly, and plant the oaks in their\r\nstead, gradually pruning and thinning away the remaining firs as the\r\noaks rise. In general, pitting is preferable to slitting; but when\r\nthe plants are very small, and the ground wet-bottomed (with close\r\nsubsoil), liable to become _honeycomby_ with frost, slitting secures\r\nthe plant better from being thrown out.\r\n\r\nOak is by far the best adapted tree for hedge-row, or for being grown\r\nby the sides of arable fields, both {36} with respect to its own\r\nqualities, and to the growth of the adjacent crops or hedge. The bark\r\nis much thicker, and more valuable in proportion to its bulk here, than\r\nin close forest, and the timber more crooked, which is desiderated in\r\noak, but which unfits most other trees for much else than firewood. The\r\noak is, besides, as generally suited for the variety of soils which\r\nlines crossing a country in all directions must embrace: this is matter\r\nof consideration, as few planters have skill to locate a number of\r\nkinds properly. It will also be thought, by reason of British feeling,\r\nthe most interesting and ornamental; nor is it to be overlooked, that,\r\nby the roots taking a more downward direction than other trees, the\r\nplough has greater liberty to proceed around, and the moisture and\r\npabulum necessary to evaporation and growth are not drawn from the\r\nground so superficially; thence the minor plants adjacent do not suffer\r\nso much. We have observed, too, that, when all cause of injury by\r\nroot suction was cut off by a deep ditch, the undergrowth seemed less\r\ninjured by shade of oak than of some other trees. The apple and the\r\npear only, appear to be as little detrimental to the surrounding crop\r\nas the oak. The ash, the elm, the beech, in Scotland the most general\r\nhedge-row trees, are the most improperly located; the ash and the {37}\r\nelm as being the most pernicious to the crops, and the beech as being\r\nof little or no value grown in hedge-row. In clays, most kinds of\r\ntrees, particularly those whose roots spread superficially, are more\r\ndetrimental to the crop around than in the more friable earths, owing\r\nto the roots in clays foraging at less depth, and to the clay being\r\na worse conductor of moisture than other earths. The disadvantages\r\nattending the planting of hedge-row with oaks are, that their removal\r\nis not in general so successful as that of other trees, especially\r\nto this exposed dry situation, and that the progress of the plant,\r\nfor a number of years, is but slow; and thus for a longer time liable\r\nto injury from cattle. Fair success may, however, be commanded, by\r\npreviously preparing the roots, should the plants be of good size;\r\ntransplanting them when the ground is neither too moist nor too dry,\r\nand in autumn, as soon as the leaves have dropped or become brown,\r\nparticularly in dry ground; performing the operation with the utmost\r\ncare not to fracture the roots, and to retain a considerable ball;\r\nopening pits of considerable size for their reception, much deeper than\r\nthe roots, and should a little water lurk in the bottom of the pit, it\r\nwill be highly beneficial, provided none stagnate so high as the roots;\r\nfirming the earth well around the roots {38} after it is carefully\r\nshaken in among the fibres; and, especially, keeping the surface of the\r\nground, within four feet of the plant, friable and free from weeds,\r\nby repeated hoeings during the first two or three summers. Of course,\r\nif you suffer the plant to waver with the wind, or to be rubbed and\r\nbruised by cattle, or by the appendages of the plough, it is folly\r\nto expect success. On this account, stout plants, from 8 to 12 feet\r\nhigh, the branches more out of the way of injury, may, in sheltered\r\nsituations, under careful management, be the most proper size. Much\r\nalso depends on procuring sturdy plants from exposed situations. We\r\nhave experienced better success with hardy plants from the exposed side\r\nof a hill, having unfibred _carrot_ roots much injured by removal,\r\nthan with others from a sheltered morass, having the most numerously\r\nfibred, well extricated roots. In cases, where, from the moistness and\r\ncoldness of the ground in early summer, there was a torpor of root\r\nsuction, and, in consequence, the developing leaves withering up under\r\nan arid atmosphere, we have attempted to stimulate the root action by\r\napplication of warm water, covering up the surface of the ground with\r\ndry litter to confine the heat; we have also endeavoured to encourage\r\nthe root action by increasing the temperature of cold light-coloured\r\nsoils, by strewing soot {39} on the surface for a yard or two around\r\nthe plant, and by nearly covering a like distance by pieces of black\r\ntrap rock, from three to six inches in diameter. The success from the\r\npieces of trap appeared greatest; they diminished the evaporation from\r\nthe ground, thence less loss of heat and of necessary moisture; and\r\nbeing at once very receptive of radiant caloric, and a good conductor,\r\nthey quickly raised the temperature of the soil in the first half of\r\nthe summer, when bodies, from the increasing power of the sun, are\r\nreceiving much more heat by radiation than they are giving out by\r\nradiation.\r\n\r\nThe oak should never be pruned severely, and this rule should be\r\nparticularly observed when the tree is young. We have known several\r\nof the most intelligent gardener-foresters in Scotland err greatly in\r\nthis; and, by exclusively pruning the oak plants, from misdirected\r\ncare, throw them far behind the other kinds of timber with which they\r\nwere mixed in planting. There is no other broad-leaved tree which we\r\nhave seen suffer so much injury in its growth, by severe pruning, as\r\nthe oak. The cause of this may be something of nervous susceptibility,\r\nor connected life, all the parts participating when one is injured; it\r\nmay be owing to the tendency to putrescency of the sap-wood, or rather\r\nof the sap, the part around the section often decaying, especially\r\n{40} when the plant is not vigorous; or it may arise from some torpor\r\nor restricted connection of the roots, which, when robbed of their\r\naffiliated branch, do not readily forage or give their foraging to the\r\nsupport of the nearest remaining branch, or to the general top of the\r\ntree, but throw out a brush of twigs near the section.\r\n\r\nAlthough the oak often lingers in the growth while young, yet, after it\r\nattains to six inches or a foot in diameter, its progress is generally\r\nfaster than most other kinds of hard wood, not appearing to suffer so\r\nmuch as others from excessive fruit-bearing. The value of the timber,\r\nand also of the bark, and the slight comparative injury occasioned to\r\nthe under crop, whether of copse, grass, corn, or roots, independently\r\nof any patriotic motives, or religious reverence lingering in our\r\nsensorium from the time of the Druids, should give a preference to this\r\ntree for planting, wherever the soil and climate are suitable, over\r\nevery other kind, with the exception of larch and willow, which, in\r\nparticular soils, will pay better.\r\n\r\nThe planter of oak should throw in a considerable proportion of Turkish\r\noak into the more favourable soils and situations. The beautiful\r\nclustered, fretted foliage of this species gives a richness, and, in\r\nwinter, when it retains the withered leaf, a warmth of colouring to\r\nour young plantations beyond any other {41} of our hardy trees and\r\nshrubs. We have had this kind, eighteen years old, equal in size to\r\nlarches of the same age in the same ground. We cut down several of\r\nthese oaks of about 8 inches in diameter, and compared the timber and\r\nbark with those of common oak of the same age. The timber was clean,\r\nvery tough and flexible, with much _flash_, and we should suppose might\r\nsuit for plank when matured; at any rate, from the splendid shew of the\r\nlaminæ (_flash_), it would form beautiful pannelling and furniture. It\r\nshrunk, however, extremely while drying, which must have been partly\r\nowing to the quick growing and youngness, it thence consisting almost\r\nentirely of sap-wood, and this sap-wood almost entirely of sap; and,\r\nwhen left in the sun in the round state, after peeling, rent nearly to\r\nsplinters,—much more than the common oak under the same exposure. The\r\nbark was about double the thickness and weight of that of the common\r\noak of equal size, and, in proportion to its weight, consisted much\r\nmore of that cellular or granular substance most productive of tannin.\r\nThe varieties of common oak with thick bark are generally of inferior\r\nquality of timber; but they are by far the finest, most luxuriant\r\ngrowing trees, with rich heavy foliage, and appear as giants standing\r\nin the same row with {42} the thin barked varieties, though planted at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nTo the naturalist the oak is an object of peculiar interest, from the\r\ncurious phenomena connected with the economy of numerous insects who\r\ndepend upon it for existence. It would be tedious to describe the\r\ndifferent apples, galls, excrescences, tufts, and other monstrosities\r\nwhich appear upon the oak. It is something like enchantment! These\r\ninsects, merely by a puncture and the deposition of an egg, or drop of\r\nfluid, turning Nature from her law, and compelling the Genius of the\r\nOak to construct of living organized oak matter, instead of leaves and\r\ntwigs, fairy domes and temples, in which their embryo young may lie for\r\na time enshrined.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH CHESTNUT—_Castanea vulgaris_, (_Fagus Castanea, L._)\r\n\r\nSpanish or sweet Chestnut, sometimes named Chestnut Oak, sometimes\r\nincluded in the genus Fagus, seems at least a connecting link between\r\nQuercus and Fagus. This valuable timber tree, the largest growing, and,\r\nin many places, also the most common in the south of Europe, and which\r\nwas once so {43} abundant in England that many of the largest of our\r\nancient piles are wooded of it, has been for several ages much on the\r\ndecrease in this country; owing, probably, to a slight refrigeration\r\nof climate, which, during this period, appears to have taken place,\r\npreventing the ripening of the seed, or, in more rigorous winters,\r\nfollowing damp, cold summers, destroying all the young plants (at\r\nleast the part above ground), whose succulent unripened shoots and\r\nmore delicate general constitution, from immatured annual round of\r\nlife, or imperfect concoction of juices, have not power to withstand\r\nthe severe cold sometimes occurring near the surface of the earth. A\r\nvery general destruction of the young plants of this kind of tree has\r\noccurred more than once within our memory from severe frost; but as the\r\nclimate, a few years back, rather improved, and the spirit of planting\r\nbecame more general, a considerable number of plants of this tree have\r\nattained height and hardihood to withstand the cold, excepting in the\r\npoints of the annual shoot, which we notice are again nipped (year\r\n1830). This may give encouragement to more extended planting, as the\r\ntree is handsome, and, in most places, where water does not abound nor\r\nstagnate, acquires great size in comparatively short time. It is said\r\nto prefer a gravelly or stone {44} rubble subsoil, but we have seen it\r\nin rich clay, in row with large beeches, even exceed them in size. We\r\nshould prefer for it any deep friable dry soil.\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance connected with this timber in this country,\r\nat least in Scotland, which must prevent its general use in ship plank,\r\nand be of material injury to it for ship timbers; this is, that few\r\ntrees of it of size are found without the timber being shaky or split,\r\nsome to such a degree that the annual rings or concentric growths have\r\nseparated from each other. This appears to be owing to our climate\r\nbeing colder than what is suitable to the nature of the plant; the\r\nsap in the stem possibly freezing in severe weather and splitting, or\r\nsevering the growths of the timber, but more probably occasioned by\r\nthe season being too short, and too moist and cold, to ripen or fill\r\nup with dense matter, sufficiently, the frame of the annual growths;\r\nthence, as each ring of sap-wood, prematurely hastened by the torpor\r\nof moisture and cold, turns to red or matured wood, and, in so doing,\r\ndries considerably within the other rings of moist sap-wood, the\r\ncontractile force may be sufficient to separate this growth from the\r\nnext external sap growth, the cohesion existing between the tissue or\r\nfabric of the growth being much stronger than the cohesion between one\r\n{45} growth and another. The uncommon dryness of the matured wood, and\r\nmoistness of the sap-wood of this tree, and smallness of the number of\r\nsap-wood rings, commonly only from 2 to 6 in this country, incline us\r\nto believe that this is the cause of the insufficiency or defect; and\r\nthat, in a milder, drier climate, the sap-wood rings will be found to\r\nbe more numerous, and thus, independent of a better first ripening,\r\naffording a longer time for their cells to be more filled up with an\r\nunctuous matter (which prevents the shrinking) gradually deposited\r\nwhile they convey the sap, the sap-wood rings being the part of the\r\ntimber through which the sap circulates. As proof of this unctuous\r\ndeposit or filling up, we observe that dry sap-wood imbibes moisture\r\nmuch quicker, and in greater quantity, than dry mature. We think this\r\npremature maturity (if we may so term it) of timber in cold countries,\r\na general law. Our larch, originally from the Apennine, has not more\r\nthan one-third of the number of sap-rings of our Scots fir, indigenous\r\nin Mar and Rannoch mountains; and our narrow-leafed, or English\r\nelm, said to have been introduced from the Holy Land in time of the\r\nCrusades, has not more than one-half of the number of our indigenous\r\nbroad-leafed, or Scots elm. From the sap-growths of Laburnum, {46}\r\nscarcely exceeding in number those of the Spanish chestnut, we should\r\nsuppose that it has been moved northward, or that the proper climate\r\nhas left it. We have observed that moist, or water-soaked ground, has\r\ninfluence, as well as climate, to deprive the alburnum vessels sooner\r\nof their living functions, inducing that torpor of tubes, or semi-vital\r\ncondition, in which they only serve to support the more active parts,\r\nand constitute what is called Mature Timber.\r\n\r\nIt is a general opinion that Spanish chestnut soon takes rot in\r\nsituations where the roots come in contact with water. This appears\r\nto result from moist soil inducing the too early maturing of the\r\ntimber already alluded to, and occasioning shaky insufficient fabric,\r\nwhich soon corrupts. We have observed oaks which had fewer layers of\r\nsap-wood, from growing in damp situations, have the timber of inferior\r\nquality, and sometimes of a shaky, brownish description, when cut\r\nacross, throwing out a dirty brownish liquid or stain.\r\n\r\nFrom the use of the Spanish chestnut in the Spanish navy, both in\r\nplanking and timbering, and from the roofing beams and ornamental\r\nwork of Westminster Hall being also of this wood, we should suppose\r\nit was not so liable to this defect of rents in {47} the timber in\r\nmilder climates. Chestnut timber is a good deal similar to oak, though\r\nnot quite so reedy and elastic, but is destitute of the large laminæ\r\nor plates (_flash_), which, radiating from the pith to the outside,\r\nbecome so prominent to view in the oak when the longitudinal section\r\nis perpendicular to the outside, in the plane of the laminæ. It is, we\r\nshould think, as capable of supporting weight, when stretching as a\r\nbeam, as the oak, and is equally, if not more durable, many beams of\r\nit existing in very old buildings undecayed: it is said even to have\r\nbeen taken out fresh where it had stood 600 years as lintels. Earth\r\nstakes of it are also very durable. It possesses one advantage over\r\noak, which must recommend it for ship-building, that is, having much\r\nless proportion of sap-wood; and, from the matured wood containing much\r\nless sap or moisture, we should suppose it not so liable to dry rot, or\r\nthat more simple means, or shorter period, would suffice for seasoning\r\nit, so as to be proof against this evil. Spanish chestnut is as yet\r\nlittle known among British shipwrights; but were a quantity of it in\r\nthe market free of the unsoundness we have alluded to, its merits would\r\nsoon become known. The bark is used by tanners, but is said not to\r\nequal that of oak.\r\n\r\n\r\n{48} BEECH-TREE—_Fagus sylvatica_.\r\n\r\nThis hardy tree occupies fully as wide a range, both of soil and\r\nclimate, as the oak, and is generally the fastest growing, most\r\nvigorous of all our hard-wood kinds, prospering on all soils, on the\r\ndry and moist, the aluminous, the calcareous, the siliceous, provided\r\nwater does not stagnate. It combines magnificence with beauty, being\r\nat once the Hercules and Adonis of our Sylva. The timber of our beech,\r\nwhile green, is by far the hardest of our large growing trees, and, in\r\nthe American forest, the members of the beechen family match better\r\nthan those of any other, with the perseverance of the ruthless Yankee;\r\nthe roots retaining the hardness deeper in the earth than those of any\r\nother tree, and being so plaited and netted throughout the ground for\r\na considerable space around the bulb, that it is next to impossible to\r\ntrench or dig over the soil till they have decayed.\r\n\r\nAs we have before stated, the timber of the beech-tree soon corrupts if\r\nit is not speedily dried, or kept in water after being cut down, and\r\nis equally liable to corruption in the tree when deprived of life by\r\nwounds or other injury. Beech has a matured and sap wood, although they\r\nare not very distinguishable, being nearly of one colour. The former\r\nhas {49} considerable durability when kept dry, the latter is speedily\r\nconsumed by worming.\r\n\r\nThe planter of beech should procure the kind[10] with yellow-coloured\r\nwood, termed by joiners Yellow Beech, in opposition to the kind with\r\nwhite wood, called White Beech. The yellow grows faster and straighter,\r\nand is cleaner and freer of black knots, and also more pleasantly\r\nworked than the white, but it corrupts much sooner in the bark when\r\ncut down. This variety of beech, when properly trained, is probably\r\nthe most profitable hard-wood that we can raise; when planked, it\r\nbends pleasantly under the shipwright to the curvature of the vessel’s\r\nside. The tree is also much superior in size and grace of outline to\r\nthe white. There are few planters who need be put in mind that beech\r\nof small size, or of short or crooked stem, is the least valuable of\r\nall timber. Whoever plants with a view to profit will, therefore,\r\nthrow in only as many beech plants as may ultimately be required for\r\nstandards, and these in the bosom of plantations; as it is seldom that\r\nbeech attains to much value in hedge-row or on the outskirts of woods,\r\n{50} from its proneness when so situated to ramify and grow crooked.\r\nIt is, however, quite possible, with a little early attention, to rear\r\nbeech as straight and clean as to be valuable, on the outskirts, where\r\nit forms a beautiful fringe to the plantation, and affords excellent\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\n\r\nELM—_Ulmus._—BROAD-LEAVED, OR SCOTCH, or WYCH ELM—_Ulmus montana._\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and most graceful tree, whose favourite locality is the\r\ndamp, deep, accumulated soil, free of stagnant water, at the bottom of\r\ndeclivities, is, together with its sister, the small-leaved kind, the\r\nEnglish elm, when so situated, the fastest growing of our hard-wood\r\ntrees. Both delight in easy or gravelly soils, though the small-leaved\r\nwill also prosper in the more adhesive, the alluvial and diluvial clays.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of kinds of elm growing in this country, differing\r\nrather more from the common run of _U. montana_ and _U. campestris_,\r\nthan what occurs among seedling varieties of untamed plants; but as\r\nthese have very probably a power of mingling by the pollen, thence not\r\nspecifically different, we leave to {51} botanists to explain their\r\nnice peculiarities, and think it sufficient to rank the whole under\r\n_montana_ and _campestris_, especially as the timber seems to range\r\ninto two kinds—_Montana_, with large leaves, heavy annual shoots,\r\nsomewhat zig-zag, thick towards the point, thence drooping a little\r\nfrom gravity; having much sap-wood, and timber of great longitudinal\r\ntoughness, but, from the great quantity of sap-wood, and want of\r\nlateral adhesion, it splits considerably in drying;—_Campestris_, with\r\nsmaller leaves, more numerous straight annual shoots, which are small\r\ntowards the point, thence more erect, has but little sap-wood, and the\r\ntimber also possessing greater lateral adhesion, and less longitudinal,\r\nit does not crack much in drying. We have noticed one broad leaved\r\nkind or variety, whose annual twigs often spring out in tufts or knots\r\nfrom one point; this seems to arise from the shoot of the preceding\r\nyear sometimes dying, probably nipped by frost, and the tuft of shoots\r\nspringing out from the knot at the lower extremity of the dead twig.\r\nFrom this cause, it has not the graceful easy spread of branches of the\r\n_U. montana_, but assumes a more angular, stiff, upright figure. We\r\nhave heard this named Dutch Elm, but it does not quite correspond with\r\nthe elm in the parks at London said to be Dutch. We consider it a kind\r\n{52} not very nearly allied to _U. montana_, yet the above peculiarity\r\nof appearance may only arise from individual tenderness, and may not be\r\naccompanied by other difference of character.\r\n\r\nThe elm, more especially the broad-leaved Scotch elm, has a peculiar\r\nfan-like sloping-to-one-side spread of branches, most perceptible\r\nwhile young; hence the tree when grown up, has generally a slight\r\nbending in the stem, which renders it very fitting for floor-timbers of\r\nvessels, the only part of a ship, excepting bottom plank, to which it\r\nis applicable, as it soon decays above water. Its great toughness and\r\nstrength, however, render it good floors.\r\n\r\nThere are some kinds of foreign elm which deserve attention. Some time\r\nago we planted several of these, and lately cut down one of about\r\nsix inches diameter, which we found a great deal harder and stronger\r\ntimber than our _U. montana_. We had this kind under the name of the\r\nBroad-leaved American. The bark was rather lighter in colour, and\r\nsmoother, than _U. montana_; the leaves were rough and large, and the\r\nannual shoots extremely luxuriant; but, probably owing to climate,\r\nor difference of circumstance, the exposed situation where we had it\r\ngrowing being very unlike the close American forest, it did not carry\r\nup its vigour of growing into {53} the top, although the top was\r\nhealthy, but continued throwing out numerous annual shoots, five or\r\nsix feet long, from the bulb and side of stem, which disposition we\r\ndid not succeed in correcting by pruning. This did not seem to arise\r\nfrom grafting, as some of the shoots broke out higher up than the graft\r\nmust have been, and there was no difference between the lower and upper\r\nshoots.\r\n\r\n_U. montana_, when come to some size, on the primary branches being\r\nlopped off, like the oak, often throws out a brush of twigs from the\r\nstem, and these twigs impeding the transit of the sap, the brush\r\nincreases, and the stem thickens considerably, in consequence of a\r\nwarty-like deposit of wood forming at the root of the twigs. This\r\nexcrescence, when of size, after being carefully seasoned in some cool\r\nmoist place, such as the north re-entering angle of a building, exposed\r\nto the chipping from the roof, forms a richer veneer for cabinet-work\r\nthan any other timber. This disposition to form brush and excrescence\r\nmight be given by art to almost any kind of tree, excepting the\r\nconiferæ and beech, and might be made a source of considerable profit.\r\nThis could easily be effected by slitting, pricking, and bruising the\r\nbark at certain periods of the season. A very beautiful waved timber\r\nmight also be formed by {54} twisting the stems of trees tight up\r\nwith round ropes, the screw circles of the rope not being quite close\r\nto each other; the ropes to remain several seasons, then to be kept\r\noff for a season or two, and again applied. The practice of forming\r\nwarty excrescences might be combined with that of forming wavy fibres,\r\nwith the finest effect. Of course, those trees with timber of rich\r\ncolour, and susceptible of high polish, would be the most suitable\r\nfor undergoing this process. _U. campestris_ also throws out a brush,\r\nbut from the great inferiority of the timber in beauty, and from its\r\nunfitness for cabinet-work, it would be useless to encourage it by\r\nart. Some plants of _montana_, not covered with brush, have a curious\r\nunevenness (laced appearance) of the timber in the stem, which renders\r\nit a beautiful cabinet plank.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARROW-LEAVED OR ENGLISH ELM—_Ulmus campestris_.\r\n\r\nThere are few Scotchmen, as they migrate southward, who have failed to\r\nremark the tame subdued appearance of the landscape of the middle and\r\nsouth of England, where a number of straggling tufted-headed poles,\r\nalong with windmill towers, occupy {55} the horizon. These straggling,\r\ntall, tufted poles, stuck in, perpendicular to the flat surface, are\r\ncomposed of living narrow-leaved elm-trees, which the perseverance of\r\nthe peasantry in quest of billets, has reduced to this condition. Some\r\nvarieties of this elm, however, when uncurtailed in lateral expansion,\r\nattain the grandest development, stretching forth a hundred giant arms\r\naloft, supporting masses of foliage, fantastically magnificent.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of London, this tree is attacked by an insect,\r\nwhich, running along the outside of the timber, within the bark,\r\nin a few seasons deprives the individual of life, the bark peeling\r\noff in large girdles, threatening to bereave this capital of the\r\nfinest ornaments of its parks. We have observed, in different kinds\r\nof growing trees, such as the apple and oak, the roads of insects\r\ntraversing between the rhind and wood, although the individual thus\r\naffected appeared to suffer little or no injury; and we consider the\r\nagency of the insect in the destruction of the English elm around\r\nLondon to be merely sequent to disease—perhaps a taint of corruption,\r\nor slight putrescency of the sap, occasioned by the _impurities of\r\nthe London air_, assisted by the hard beaten state of the ground[11]\r\nabove the roots. Should {56} any one examine the inside of the bark\r\nof a cut tree, when corruption has just begun with the bark, and see\r\nhow thoroughly it is undermined by insects, he will, we think, admit\r\nthe strong probability, that the insect is only subordinate in the\r\ndestruction of those fine old elms around London. We do not wonder at\r\nthe condition of the trees—it would not surprise us if the human race\r\nin London were swept off by some similar secondary cause.\r\n\r\nThe small-leaved elm has great disposition to spread by suckers from\r\nthe roots, and thus extended has become very prevalent throughout\r\nmost parts of England, in the broad wastes (termed fences), which,\r\nfrom the indolent husbandry, consequent to tithes and the want of\r\nleases, generally surround the pasture and corn fields, but which are\r\nso necessary to these unvaried plains, as some prominent object, or\r\ncharacteristic land-mark, on which the _amor patriæ_ of the population\r\nmay perch; the finest remembrances and associations of youth being\r\nmixed up with these bushy flower-covered enclosures.\r\n\r\nIt is with country as with society, strong lasting {57} attachment\r\noccurs only where there is individuality of character to give\r\ndistinctness of image.\r\n\r\n “Oh! how should I my true love know,\r\n From many other one?”\r\n\r\nThere is design and utility in this fascination of peculiarity. If\r\nindividual distinction be but strongly marked, it signifies little\r\nof what character. Love of country often hangs upon features of the\r\nharshest and most fearful description, with which the associations\r\nand feelings become entwisted, as attachment to individual is often\r\nrivetted by fierce, austere, or even morose qualities.\r\n\r\nThe narrow-leaved elm is valuable for forming the blocks and\r\ndead-eyes[12], and other wooden furniture of rigging, being\r\nparticularly suitable for these purposes, from its hard and adhesive\r\nnature, and indisposition to crack or split, when exposed to sun and\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nWe have observed many minor distinctions, perhaps individual, in the\r\nabove kinds of elm, in figure, size and smoothness of leaf, in colour\r\nand roughness {58} of bark, &c. Some varieties or individuals of the\r\nEnglish elm have the bark of the young twigs and branches covered with\r\ncorky ridges: others want this excrescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nREDWOOD WILLOW, _or_ STAG’S HEAD OZIER,—_Salix fragilis_[13].\r\n\r\nThis kind of willow, once very common in the alluvial parts of\r\nScotland, before the introduction of _Salix alba_, _S. Russelliana_,\r\n&c., is probably the most profitable timber that can be planted in such\r\nsoils. It was our district’s maxim, that “the willow will purchase the\r\nhorse before any other timber purchase the saddle,” on account of its\r\nvery quick growth, and the value of its timber. It delights in {59}\r\nthe rich easy clay by the sides of our _pows_ (the old Scottish term\r\nfor those sluggish natural drains of our alluvial districts), throwing\r\nout its fibril roots in matted-like abundance under the water: it also\r\nflourishes in the more sandy and gravelly alluvion, by the sides of\r\nrivers and streams, which does not become too dry in summer.\r\n\r\nThis tree, similar to some others which, like it, are continued\r\nby cuttings or layers, is, in certain seasons, especially when of\r\nconsiderable size, subject to a derangement in the sap-concoction,\r\nwhich leads to the death of some of its more recent parts, particularly\r\nthe uppermost branches; whence its withered top sometimes assumes the\r\nappearance of a stag’s head of horns, which, from the indestructibility\r\nof these dead branches, it retains for many years; new branches\r\nspringing out from the sides, of much luxuriance. This disease, similar\r\nto canker in the genus Pyrus, is generally concentrated to certain\r\nplaces of the bark and alburnum, the portion of branch above these\r\nplaces thence withering, the connection with the root being cut off;\r\nthough sometimes the points of the twigs appear to be nipped, without\r\nany previous disease. From these affections, and also on account of\r\nthe branches and stem being often rifted by the winds, the tree is\r\nfrequently found with rot {60} in the stem, when it has stood long. It\r\nagrees in this with the larch, that, though its timber, when cut down,\r\nor withered and dried, as on the top of the tree, is little liable to\r\ncorruption, yet it is very subject to it, as part of the stem of the\r\nliving tree, perhaps under certain circumstances of semi-vitality.\r\nTo determine whether this tree, raised from seed, would be liable to\r\nthese disorders, the same as when continued by slips, would be an\r\ninteresting, though tedious, experiment. We never have seen any young\r\nseed-plants rise around old trees.\r\n\r\nThe use of the red wood willow, as timbers of vessels, has been of\r\nlong standing in this part of Scotland, and has proved its long\r\nendurance, and excellent adaptation. By reason of its lightness,\r\npliancy, elasticity, and toughness, it is, we think, the best, without\r\nexception, for the formation of small fast-sailing war-vessels. We\r\nare pretty certain that our Navy Board would not have cause to regret\r\ntrial of it in a long, low, sharp schooner, of sufficient breadth to\r\nstand up under great press of sail, moulded as much as possible to\r\ncombine great stability with small resistance from the water, and when\r\nin quick motion to be buoyant—especially not to dip forward,—provided\r\nit could be procured not too old, and free from rot, large knots, and\r\ncross-grain; a very {61} little attention in the cultivation would\r\nafford it of the finest bends, and clean and fresh. Our Navy Board\r\nhave received some slight teaching from our transatlantic brethren, of\r\nthe superior sailing of fir-constructed vessels, to those of oak, the\r\nresult of their superior lightness, pliancy, and elasticity.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this has also had experience of two vessels, one of oak,\r\nand the other of larch, on the same voyages, at the same time, and has\r\nfound the latter superior in sailing to the former, in a degree greater\r\nthan the difference of build could account for. From the superior\r\nelasticity and lightness of the willow, even to larch, the lightest\r\nand most elastic of the fir-tribe, we should expect that vessels of it\r\nwould outstrip those of fir, at least of Scots or red pine, as much\r\nas the latter do those of oak; and that, from this greater elasticity\r\nand lightness, they would move through the water, yielding to the\r\nresistance and percussions of the waves, compared to those of oak, as a\r\nthing of life to a dead block. For vessel-timbers, this wood requires\r\nto be used alone; as, when mixed with other kinds less pliant or\r\nelastic, the latter have to withstand nearly all the impetus or strain,\r\nand are thence liable to be broken, or from the vessel yielding more at\r\none place than another, she is apt to strain and become leaky. {62}\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when demolishing an old building which had stood fully\r\na century, the writer found the large frames of the building, or ground\r\n_couples_, which, from their situation, could not have been renewed, to\r\nconsist of this timber; and, with the exception of the outside, which\r\nwas so much decayed, for about half an inch in depth, as the finger\r\ncould pick it away, the body of the wood was as fresh as at first,\r\nstill fit for any purpose, and of a beautiful pink or salmon colour.\r\nWhen we observed the mouldering exterior of these pieces, we laid one\r\nof the smallest hollow over a log, and struck it with a large wooden\r\nmallet, not doubting that it would go to fragments; such, however, was\r\nthe _resilience_, that the mallet rebounded so greatly as almost to\r\nleap from our hands.\r\n\r\nFor country purposes, red-wood willow is employed in the construction\r\nof mill water-wheels, of the body or hoarding of carts, especially of\r\nlining of carts employed in the carriage of stones, or of any utensil\r\nrequiring strong, tough, light, durable boarding. Formerly, before\r\nthe introduction of iron-hoops for cart-wheels, the external rim or\r\nfelloe was made of willow; when new, the cart or wain was driven along\r\na road covered with hard small gravel (in preference, gravel somewhat\r\nangular), by which means {63} the felloe shod itself with stone,\r\nand thus became capable of enduring the friction of the road for a\r\nlong time, the toughness and elasticity of the willow retaining the\r\ngravel till the stone was worn away. Under much exposure to blows and\r\nfriction, this willow outlasts every other home timber. When recently\r\ncut, the matured wood is slightly reddish, and the sap-wood white. When\r\nexposed to the air and gradually dried, both are of salmon colour,\r\nand scarcely distinguishable from each other. Willow-bark is used in\r\ntanning; it also contains a bitter, said to be febrifuge.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED-WOOD PINE—_Pinus_.\r\n\r\nThis tribe of the order Coniferæ, at once the most useful, and the most\r\nplentifully and widely extended over the North temperate zone—that\r\nportion of the earth more congenial to man, and which contains about\r\nfour-fifths of his numbers, has a similitude of character and qualities\r\nmore distinguishable by one glance of the eye than by laboured\r\ndescription. It consists of a number of kinds, which again divide into\r\nfamilies and individuals perceptibly different from each other. The\r\nfollowing are those whose timber is best known to us: {64}\r\n\r\n Scots fir, or Norway pine,         _Pinus sylvestris_.\r\n Pinaster,                          _Pinus Pinaster_.\r\n Canadian red Pine[14] (foreign),       *  *  *  *\r\n Pitch pine (foreign),                  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\nAnd, though a little more distinct,\r\n\r\n Yellow American, or Weymouth Pine, _Pinus Strobus_.\r\n\r\nVery little observation will distinguish these from the next useful\r\ngreat tribe of the Coniferæ with white wood, the Spruces and Silver\r\nFirs—Abies.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of foreign kinds of pine, some of great promise,\r\nrecently introduced into Britain, but of whose adaptation for\r\nship-building we cannot speak. Samples of the timber of _P. laricio_,\r\n_P. tæda_, _P. cembra_, _P. maritima_, _P. rigida_, &c. of British\r\ngrowth, may, however, soon be had of sufficient size for experiment.\r\nThe common Scots fir is the only pine of British growth which has been\r\nemployed as a naval timber; for which purpose, however, since the last\r\npeace, and the introduction of our larch, it is in very little demand.\r\n\r\nAn acute botanist, Mr G. Don of Forfar, a number of years ago, gave a\r\ndescription of the varieties of cultivated Scots fir which had come\r\nunder his notice. The following is an abstract of his observations:\r\n{65}\r\n\r\n “_Varieties of Pinus sylvestris._\r\n\r\n “Var. 1st. The common variety, well known by its branches forming\r\n a pyramidal head, the leaves marginated, of dark-green colour, but\r\n little glaucous underneath, the cones being considerably elongated and\r\n tapering to the point, and the bark of the trunk very rugged. This\r\n variety seems short-lived, becoming soon stunted in appearance.\r\n\r\n “Var. 2d, Distinguishable from the former by disposition of branches,\r\n which are remarkable for horizontal disposition and tendency to\r\n bend downwards close to the trunk. The leaves are broader than var.\r\n 1st, and serrulated, not marginated; leaves are distinguishable at\r\n a distance by their much lighter and beautiful glaucous colour, the\r\n bark not so rugged as var. 1st, and the cones thicker and not so much\r\n pointed, and also smoother. This tree seems a hardy plant, growing\r\n freely in many soils: this variety may be named Pinus horizontalis.\r\n Var. 1st, much more general than var. 2d, and also sooner comes to\r\n seed, which is also easier gathered from the position of the branches.\r\n\r\n “Var. 3d, Is of a still lighter colour than var. 2d, being of a light\r\n glaucous hue, approaching to a silvery tint; its branches form, like\r\n var. 1st, a pyramidal head, but it differs remarkably in its cones\r\n from {66} both the former varieties; the cones of this seem beset\r\n with blunt prickles bent backwards, the leaves serrulated. This\r\n variety is rather more common than var. 2d; like it, it is a good tree.\r\n\r\n “Var. 4th, The leaves somewhat curled or rather twisted, and much\r\n shorter than the others: this variety is very rare.”\r\n\r\nOur observation does not go to confirm these subdivisions. We think\r\nthey are little more distinct than the fair, the red[15], the black\r\nhaired, the fair, the sallow, the brown complexioned, the tall,\r\nthe short, of the same community or even family of men. There is\r\nvariation and individuality more or less strongly marked in all kinds\r\nof organized beings: at least those vegetables which have exposed\r\nfructification possess it; many whose fructification is secluded also\r\npossess it; and the others of more constant character, such as some\r\nof the Gramineæ, with a little art (removing their anthers before the\r\npollen bursts forth, and applying the pollen of others as near to them\r\nin the chain of life as can be found to be different, or changing the\r\ncircumstances by culture), can also be rendered equally {67} variable.\r\nThese minor distinctions or individualities of vegetables become more\r\nperceptible as our observation closes in upon the object. We have never\r\nyet found one individual apple plant, raised from seed, to be the\r\ncounterpart of another; but differing even in every part and habit,\r\nin bud, leaf, flower, fruit, seed, bark, wood, root; in luxuriance of\r\ngrowth; in hardihood; in being suited for different soils and climates,\r\nsome thriving in the very moist, others only in the dry; in the\r\ndisposition of the branches, erect, pendulous, horizontal; in earliness\r\nand comparative earliness of leaf, of flower, of fruit.\r\n\r\nWe hope the above remarks will not be lost on those who have the\r\nmanagement of the sowing, planting, and thinning of woods, and that\r\nthey will always have selection in view. Although numerous varieties\r\nare derived from the seed of one tree, yet if that tree be of a good\r\n_breed_, the chances are greatly in favour of this progeny being also\r\ngood. Scots fir of good variety will thrive and reach considerable size\r\nand age, in almost any soil which is not very moist, or very arid and\r\nbarren (such as our sand and gravel flats much impregnated with iron\r\nor other deleterious mineral), provided the plants from their earliest\r\nyears have room to throw out and retain a sufficiency of side branches.\r\nThis is especially necessary to their health where the soil is {68}\r\nungenial, the resulting vigour often overcoming the disadvantages.\r\nFrom the pine being found chiefly in the light sandy districts on the\r\ncontinent of Europe, and in the sandy pine barrens of America, an idea\r\nhas gone abroad that these barren districts are more congenial to it\r\nthan the more clayey, the more rocky, or the richer vegetable mould;\r\nbut its natural location in the barren sandy districts results from its\r\nbeing more powerful in this soil than any other plant of the country,\r\nnot from preference of this soil. Should any one doubt of this, let him\r\ntake a summer excursion to Mar Forest, where no other tree having been\r\nin competition with Pinus sylvestris, and where it is spread over the\r\nhill and the dale, he will observe that it prospers best in good timber\r\nsoil, and though comparatively preferring an easy soil, and having\r\nsuperior adaptation to thin or rocky ground, that its taste does not\r\ndiffer very materially from that of the plane or the elm, the oak or\r\nthe ash.\r\n\r\nIn Mar Forest he will also observe (if they be not now all cut down)\r\nseveral well marked individuals of the _splatch_ pine, esteemed a very\r\nvaluable and hardy kind; and with the right which a botanist has in a\r\nplant sown by nature, he may bear off some of the seeds, and endeavour\r\nto spread this rare indigenous kind throughout the island. Should he be\r\nunsuccessful in finding these at Mar, he may return {69} by Kenmore,\r\nwhere, on the side of the hill on the right bank of the Tay, near the\r\nconfluence of the Lyon, he will find several trees, we think five,\r\nof this kind of pine, of considerable size, growing at one place,\r\napparently planted: we were told the plants had been brought down from\r\nthe natural forest farther up on the mountains. These are sufficiently\r\ndistinct in character from the common Scots fir growing around, having\r\na horizontal, straggling disposition of branches, the leaves being of\r\na much lighter, different shade of green, and more tufted, and the\r\nbark of a yellower red, so as to merit a distinct name; and we should\r\nconsider Pinus horizontalis as descriptive as any other, if it shall\r\nnot appear to be only a sub-species of P. sylvestris. The descriptive\r\nname _splatch_ fir, is from the prominences of the rugged bark not\r\nbeing in longitudinal ridges or flutes, but in detached flat oblong\r\nlumps, such as soft clay or mud takes when cast with force upon a wall.\r\nWe, however, do not think this the same as Mr DON’s var. 2d, at least\r\nwe have noticed in our lowland woods raised by planting, such as Mr DON\r\nexamined, individuals here and there having less or more resemblance to\r\nhis described varieties, but none of them approaching the distinctness\r\nof this alpine Scots fir. The proprietors of this kind of pine will\r\nconfer a benefit on the public by causing the timber {70} be examined\r\nand compared with that of trees of equal size of the common Scots fir\r\ngrowing near, and making a public report of the number and size of\r\nannual growths, the number of these of matured and of sap wood, the\r\ncomparative strength, density, quantity of resinous deposit, hardness,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe Pinaster is a valuable kind of red-wood pine, with strong resinous\r\ntimber, and from not having one-half the number of sap-wood layers of\r\nthe common Scots fir, we should consider it deserving attention as a\r\nnaval timber; but perhaps the small number of sap-layers is from want\r\nof climate: owing to the branches being larger, and, in proportion to\r\ntheir size, being joined to the stem with a larger swell than those of\r\nP. sylvestris, the timber is rougher with larger knots. In the very\r\nbarren sand and gravel district near Christchurch, scarcely affording\r\nsustenance to lichens, and where even heaths will not grow, we have\r\nobserved this tree make considerable progress, and outstrip the Scots\r\nfir in growth.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Red Pine has been employed to a considerable extent in\r\nthis country, both as planking and spars. It is inferior in strength\r\nand durability to the Baltic red pine, and would seldom make its\r\nappearance on this side the Atlantic while the Baltic was open to us,\r\ndid not a very ill advised {71} duty obstruct the supply of the better\r\narticle. This timber is sometimes supplied with a good character by the\r\nshipwright, as it is soft, pliant, and easily worked. The Canadian red\r\npine has a greater number of layers of sap-wood than any other red pine\r\nwe are acquainted with; we have repeatedly counted 100 sap-wood layers.\r\nWe have never seen this kind of pine growing in Britain.\r\n\r\nThe most common American pine, with yellow timber, Pinus strobus, has\r\nbeen introduced for a long time back into Britain, it is said first by\r\nthe Earl of Weymouth, thence sometimes named Weymouth Pine. This rather\r\nelegant tree requires a warm sheltered situation, as it is easily torn\r\ndown by wind, from the weakness of the timber, which is inferior in\r\nhardness and strength to any other pine we are acquainted with; and\r\nfrom its slender needle leaf not having substance to withstand the\r\nevaporation of much exposure. Altogether, the kind appears rather out\r\nof climate in Britain, and, though the monarch of the pines in Canada,\r\nholds here but a very subordinate place. Although extremely tender and\r\nlight, the matured timber does not soon decay when cut out thin and\r\nexposed to wind and weather, nor worm when kept dry in houses; but when\r\nemployed in shipbuilding,—remaining always between the moist {72} and\r\ndry, the condition most favourable to putrefaction, and surrounded by\r\na close, warm, putrid atmosphere,—it very soon, especially in masses,\r\nbecomes corrupted. It requires more time to season or dry in the\r\ndeal than any other wood, owing to the fineness of fibre, smallness\r\nof pores, and want of density. From this quality of parting with its\r\nmoisture with extreme slowness, it forms convenient deck-planking for\r\nvessels on tropical stations, or when employed in carriage of unslacked\r\nlime, as the plank does not readily shrink and become leaky under the\r\ngreat evaporation occasioned by the heat and arid air. Yellow pine has\r\ngenerally about 40 growths of sap-wood.\r\n\r\nWe have had no acquaintance with American pitch pine as a growing tree.\r\nAs a timber, it is superior in several respects to all the others,\r\nhaving a great deal more resinous matter, so much, as often to render\r\nit semitranslucent. It is strong and weighty, and is used as a naval\r\ntimber for most of the purposes to which other pine timber is applied.\r\nIt forms the very best bottom planking. The shipwrights of the docks\r\nat Devonport will attest its quality, as the bottom planking of the\r\nGibraltar of 80 guns: this vessel carried home to England from the\r\nMediterranean, a piece of coral rock of about ten tons weight sticking\r\nin her bottom, her preservation {73} in all probability resulting from\r\nthe adhesive quality of this timber. Its great weight is, however,\r\na considerable inconveniency attending its use as spars, and the\r\nabundance of resin, we should think, would unfit it for tree-nails;\r\nresinous tree-nails,—probably from some derangement of the structure\r\nor disposition to chemical change produced in the resin by the very\r\ngreat pressure of the hard driving,—soon corrupting and infecting the\r\nadjacent wood. In some cases we have also known very resinous Baltic\r\nplank decay soon in vessels. The pitch pine, from the quantity of\r\nresin, contracts little in drying, at least for a long time, till the\r\nresin itself begins to dry up. It forms the best house-floors we have\r\nseen, being strong and durable, continuing close at joinings, and the\r\nfibre not readily taking in moisture when washed.\r\n\r\nOur red-wood pine, when come to some age, is in wet ground attacked\r\nby rot, which commences in the bulb and adjacent roots and stem, in a\r\nmanner very similar to the rot in larch. The red-wood also approaches\r\nnearer to the outside where this rot exists, and on the side of the\r\ntree where the rot is greatest. Most of our planted red pine forest,\r\nespecially in poor wet tills, and in all flat sandy moorish ground of\r\nclose subsoil, fall by decay at from 30 to 60 years old. This decay is\r\ngradual, owing to the {74} difference in strength of constitution of\r\nthe individuals. Closeness of rearing and consequent tall nakedness of\r\nstem, and disproportion of leaves to stem, would alone induce this in\r\na few years longer even in good soil, excepting perhaps in protected\r\nnarrow dells; but the decay commences much sooner when the soil is\r\nunfavourable, and is no doubt accelerated by the mode of extracting\r\nthe seeds by kiln-drying the cones, and by using a weak variety of the\r\nplant. The approach of this decay may often be noticed, several years\r\nprevious, in the saw-cross section of the stem mid-way up the tree—an\r\nirregular portion of the section appearing of a different shade, from\r\nbreaking off free and irregular before the teeth of the saw, and not\r\nhaving so much fibrous cover as the healthy part. When Scots fir rises\r\nnaturally, it is not nearly so subject to this decay even in very\r\ninferior soils: the plants having generally much more room from the\r\nfirst, do not rise so tall, have more branch in proportion to stem,\r\nthence are more vigorous. The cones not being injured by kiln-drying,\r\nmay also account for this.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the red pine in Scotland has fewer sap-wood layers than\r\nthe red pine of Memel or of North America, and also the fact that, in\r\nmost situations in Scotland, the red pine soon {75} decays—soonest\r\nin the places where the trees have fewest sap-wood layers, and where\r\nthe timber has been planted, that is, where the cones have been\r\nkiln-dried—is worthy of notice. Scots red pine has generally from 15\r\nto 40 layers, Memel from 40 to 50, Canadian often 100. We consider the\r\nlong moist open winter and cold ungenial spring in Scotland, and the\r\ntill bottoms soaking with water, perhaps aided by the transplanting,\r\nand the kiln-drying of the cones, to be the cause of this early loss\r\nof vitality or change of sap-wood into matured. In Poland and Prussia,\r\nthe earth does not remain so long cold and moist as in Scotland, but\r\nis either frozen or sufficiently warm and dry;—this occurs even to a\r\ngreater degree in Canada[16], and neither the Memel nor Canadian have\r\nany chance of being planted or kiln-dried.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE LARCH—_Larix communis_, (_L. pyramidalis_).\r\n\r\nWhite Larch is a timber tree combining so many advantages, its\r\nproperties so imperfectly known, of {76} so recent introduction,\r\nand of such general culture, (about 10,000,000 plants being sold\r\nannually from the nurseries of the valley of the Tay alone), that any\r\naccurate notice of its history, its habitudes, and uses, must possess\r\nan interest sufficient to arrest the attention of every one, from the\r\nstatesman and economist down to the mere lord and the squire. We shall\r\ntherefore devote to it a little more of our attention than we have\r\nbestowed on those already treated of.\r\n\r\nLarch is scattered over a considerable part of the northern hemisphere,\r\ninhabiting nearly the same regions with the other Coniferæ. White\r\nlarch, the kind[17] common in Britain, is found growing extensively on\r\nthe alpine districts of the south of Europe, in Italy, Switzerland,\r\nSardinia; this may be termed the European temperate species. Another,\r\nnative to the country around Archangel, and extending from {77} Norway\r\neastward through Russia and Siberia, of inferior size, may be styled\r\nthe European Hyperborean. North America, like the old world, is said to\r\npossess a temperate and hyperborean species. The first, Black Larch (L.\r\npendula), more generally extending along the longitudinal parallel of\r\nthe United States; the other, Red Larch (L. microcarpa), along that of\r\nLower Canada and Labrador. We have seen the American temperate attain\r\n18 inches in diameter in Scotland, but it is much inferior in figure\r\nand growth, and also cleanness of timber, to the Appenine or European\r\ntemperate, being covered with knots and protuberances. Though rough,\r\nthe timber is said to be of excellent quality.\r\n\r\nIt is now upwards of 80 years since the larch, so common in Britain,\r\nwas brought from the Appenines to Strath-Tay. The rapidity of its\r\ngrowth and striking novelty of appearance, assisted by the influence of\r\nthe family of Athole (to a female of which some say we owe its first\r\nintroduction), soon attracted general attention: it quickly spread over\r\nthe neighbouring country, and was planted in every variety of soil\r\nand situation, from the unfitness of which, in most places of the low\r\ncountry, it is already fast decaying. About 40 years ago it began to\r\nbe planted in many parts of Britain. It is now introduced into almost\r\nevery new plantation in the two islands, and {78} the space of country\r\ncovered by its shade is extending with a rapidity unparalleled in the\r\nhistory of any other ligneous plant.\r\n\r\nLarch is generally conceived to be an alpine[18] plant, and its decay\r\nin the low country attributed to situation or climate. This idea\r\nseems to have arisen from its locality in Italy, and from observing\r\nit succeed so well in our alpine districts, not taking into account\r\nthat the soil is different,—that it may be the soil of these districts\r\nwhich conduces to the prosperity of the larch, and not the altitude.\r\nThroughout Scotland, wherever we have observed the decay, it appeared\r\nto have resulted almost solely from unsuitableness of soil. We have\r\nwitnessed it as much diseased on our highest trap hills, 1000 feet\r\nin altitude, as on a similar soil at the base. Yet the freeness from\r\nputrescency or miasma of the pure air of the mountain, {79} and\r\ndeficiency of putrescent matter in the ground, or other more obscure\r\nagencies connected with primitive ranges, may have some influence to\r\ncounterbalance unsuitableness of soil. It is not probable that the\r\ncoolness and moisture of altitude would be necessary in Scotland to the\r\nhealthy growth of a vegetable which flourishes under Italian suns, on\r\nthe general level of the Appenine and on the Sardinian hills.\r\n\r\nThe rot, so general in growing larch, though sometimes originating in\r\nthe bulb or lower part of the stem, seems to have its commencement\r\nmost frequently in the roots. Thence the corruption proceeds upwards\r\nalong the connecting tubes or fibres into the bulb, and gradually\r\nmounts the stem, which, when much diseased, swells considerably\r\nfor a few feet above the ground, evidently from the new layers of\r\nsap-wood forming thicker to afford necessary space for the fluids to\r\npass upward and downward—the matured wood through which there is no\r\ncirculation approaching at this place within one or two annual layers\r\nof the outside. In a majority of cases, the rot commences in the\r\nroots which have struck down deepest into the earth, especially those\r\nunder the stool; these having been thrown to a considerable depth by\r\nthe young plant, as the tree enlarges, are shut out from aëration,\r\n&c. by the {80} superior increasing stool and hard-pressed earth\r\nunderneath it; this earth at the same time becoming exhausted of the\r\nparticular pabulum of the plant. It is, therefore, quite probable, from\r\nthese parts of the roots being the weakest, that they will be most\r\nsusceptible of injury from being soaked in stagnant water in the flat\r\ntills[19], starved during droughts in light sand, tainted by the putrid\r\nvapours of rich vegetable mould, or poisoned by the corrosive action\r\nof pernicious minerals. It may also be supposed that these smothered\r\nsickly roots, not possessing sufficient power or means of suction\r\n(endosmose), will be left out in the general economy of vegetation of\r\nthe plant, thence lose vitality, and become corrupt. But this affords\r\nno explanation why the larch roots, under these circumstances, are more\r\nliable to corruption than those of other trees, or how the bulb itself\r\nshould become contaminated. {81}\r\n\r\nWe have cut off the top, where the diameter of the section was about\r\nthree inches, from sound young larch trees, and found a similar rot\r\nproceed downwards in a few months from the section, as rises from the\r\ndiseased roots in improper soil. There is something favourable to the\r\nquick progress of this rot in the motion of the sap, or vitality of the\r\ntree; as, under no common circumstances, would the wood of a cut larch\r\ntree become tainted in so short a time.\r\n\r\nThe rot, though most general in trees which are chilled in wet cold\r\ntills, or starved in dry sand, or sickly from any other cause, is also\r\noften found to take place in the most luxuriant growing plants in open\r\nsituations, branched to the ground, and growing in deep soil free\r\nfrom stagnating water. There must, therefore, be some constitutional\r\ntendency to corruption in the larch, which is excited by a combination\r\nof circumstances; and we must limit our knowledge for the present\r\nto the fact, that certain soils, perhaps slightly modified by other\r\ncircumstances, produce sound, and others unsound larch, without\r\nadmitting any general influence from altitude, excepting in so far as\r\nits antiseptic influence may go.\r\n\r\nThe fitness of soil for larch seems to depend more especially upon\r\nthe ability the soil possesses of affording an equable supply of\r\nmoisture; that is, upon its {82} mechanical division, or its powers of\r\nabsorption or retention of moisture; and its chemical composition would\r\nseem only efficacious as conducive to this.\r\n\r\nSoils and subsoils[20] may be divided into two classes. The first,\r\nwhere larch will acquire a size of from 30 to 300 solid feet, and is\r\ngenerally free of rot; the second, where it reaches only from 6 to 20\r\nfeet solid, and in most cases becomes tainted with rot before 30 years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I. SOILS AND SUBSOILS FOR LARCH.\r\n\r\n_Sound rock, with a covering of firm loam, particularly when the rock\r\nis jagged or cloven, or much dirupted and mixed with the earth._—In\r\nsuch cases, a very slight covering or admixture of earth will suffice.\r\nWe would give the preference to primitive rock, especially micaceous\r\nschist and mountain limestone. Larch seldom succeeds well on sandstone\r\nor on trap, except on steep slopes, where the rock is quite sound and\r\nthe soil firm. {83}\r\n\r\nFully the one half of Scotland, comprehending nearly all the alpine\r\npart, consists of primary rock, chiefly micaceous schist and gneiss.\r\nThese rocks are generally less decayed at the surface, better\r\ndrained, and fuller of clefts and fissures containing excellent earth\r\n(especially on slopes), into which the roots of trees penetrate and\r\nreceive healthy nourishment, than the other primitive and transition\r\nrocks, granite, porphyry, trap, or the secondary and tertiary\r\nformations of nearly horizontal strata, red and white sandstone, &c.\r\nPrimary strata are generally well adapted for larch, except where\r\nthe surface has acquired a covering of peat-moss, or received a flat\r\ndiluvial bed of close wet till or soft moorish sand, or occupies a too\r\nelevated or exposed situation—the two latter exceptions only preventing\r\nthe growth, not inducing rot.\r\n\r\n_Gravel_, not too ferruginous, and in which water does not stagnate in\r\nwinter, even though nearly bare of vegetable mould, especially on steep\r\nslopes, and where the air is not too arid, is favourable to the growth\r\nof larch. It seems to prefer the coarser gravel, though many of the\r\nstones exceed a yard solid.\r\n\r\nThe straths or valleys of our larger rivers, in their passage through\r\nthe alpine country, are generally {84} occupied, for several hundred\r\nfeet of perpendicular altitude up the slope, by gravel, which covers\r\nthe primitive strata to considerable depth, especially in the eddies of\r\nthe salient angles of the hill. Every description of tree grows more\r\nluxuriantly here than in any other situation of the country; the causes\r\nof this are, _1st_, The open bottom allowing the roots to penetrate\r\ndeep, without being injured by stagnant moisture; _2d_, The percolation\r\nof water down through the gravel from the superior hill; _3d_, The\r\ndryness of the surface not producing cold by evaporation, thence the\r\nground soon heating in the spring; _4th_, The moist air of the hill\r\nrefreshing and nourishing the plant during the summer heats, and\r\ncompensating for the dryness of the soil; _5th_, The reverberating of\r\nthe sun’s rays, between the sides of the narrow valley, thus rendering\r\nthe soil comparatively warmer than the incumbent air, which is cooled\r\nby the oblique currents of the higher strata of air, occasioned by the\r\nunequal surface of the ground. This comparatively greater warmth of the\r\nground, when aided by moisture, either in the soil or atmosphere, is\r\ngreatly conducive to the luxuriancy of vegetation.\r\n\r\n_Firm dry clays and sound brown loam._—Soils well adapted for wheat and\r\nred clover, not too rich, {85} and which will bear cattle in winter,\r\nare generally congenial to the larch.\r\n\r\n_All very rough ground, particularly ravines, where the soil is\r\nneither soft sand nor too wet; also the sides of the channels of\r\nrapid rivulets._—The roots of most trees luxuriate in living or\r\nflowing water; and, where it is of salubrious quality, especially when\r\ncontaining a slight solution of lime, will throw themselves out a\r\nconsiderable distance under the stream. The reason why steep slopes,\r\nand hills whose strata are nearly perpendicular to the horizon, are so\r\nmuch affected by larch and other trees, is, because the moisture in\r\nsuch situations is in motion, and often continues dripping through the\r\nfissures throughout the whole summer. The desideratum of situation for\r\nlarch, is where the roots will neither be drowned in stagnant water in\r\nwinter, nor parched by drought in summer, and where the soil is free\r\nfrom any corrosive mineral or corrupting mouldiness.\r\n\r\nLarch, in suitable soil, sixty years planted, and seasonably thinned,\r\nwill have produced double the value of what almost any other timber\r\nwould have done; and from its general adaptation both for sea and land\r\npurposes, it will always command a ready sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n{86} CLASS II. SOILS AND SUBSOILS WHERE LARCH TAKES DRY ROT.\r\n\r\n_Situations (steep slopes excepted) with cold till subsoil, nearly\r\nimpervious to water._—The larch succeeds worst when moorish dead\r\nsand alone, or with admixture of peat, occupies the surface of these\r\nretentive bottoms. Where the whole soil and subsoil is one uniform,\r\nretentive, firm till, it will often reach considerable size before\r\nbeing attacked by the rot. When this heavy till occupies a steep slope,\r\nthe larch will sometimes succeed well, owing to the more equable supply\r\nof moisture, and the water in the soil not stagnating, but gliding down\r\nthe declivity.\r\n\r\nIn general, soils whose surface assumes the appearance of honeycomb\r\nin time of frost, owing to the great quantity of water imbibed by\r\nthe soil, will not produce large sound larch. More than half the low\r\ncountry of Scotland is soil of this description.\r\n\r\n_Soft sand soil and subsoil._—Sand is still less adapted for growing\r\nlarch than the tills, the plants being often destroyed by the summer’s\r\ndrought before they attain size for any useful purpose: the rot also\r\nattacks earlier here than in the tills. It appears that {87} light\r\nsand, sloping considerably on moist back-lying alpine situations,\r\ncovered towards the south by steep hill, will sometimes produce\r\nsound larch; whereas did the same sand occupy a dry front or lowland\r\nsituation, the larch would not succeed in it. The same moist back\r\nsituation that conduces to produce sound larch in light dry soils, may\r\nprobably tend to promote rot in the wet. The moisture and the less\r\nevaporation of altitude diminishing the tendency to rot in dry light\r\nsand, and increasing it in wet till. Larch will sometimes succeed well\r\nin sharp dry alluvial sand left by rivulets.\r\n\r\n_Soils incumbent on brittle dry trap, or broken slaty\r\nsandstone._—Although soil, the debris of trap, be generally much better\r\nadapted for the production of herbaceous vegetables than that of\r\nsandstone or freestone, yet larch does not seem to succeed much better\r\non the former than the latter. The deeper superior soils, generally\r\nincumbent on the recent dark red sandstone, are better suited for larch\r\nthan the shallow inferior soils incumbent on the old grey and red\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\n_Ground having a subsoil of dry rotten rock, and which sounds hollow to\r\nthe foot in time of drought._\r\n\r\n_Rich deaf earth, or vegetable {88} mould._—Independently of receiving\r\nultimate contamination from the putrid juices or exhalations of this\r\nsoil, the larch does not seem, even while remaining sound, to make so\r\nmuch comparative progress of growth, as some of the hard wood trees, as\r\nelm, ash, plane.\r\n\r\n_Black or grey moorish soils, with admixture of peat-moss._\r\n\r\nAlthough the soils specified in this class will not afford fine large\r\nlarch for naval use, yet they may be very profitably employed in\r\ngrowing larch for farming purposes, or for coal-mines, where a slight\r\ntaint of rot is of minor importance. The lightness of larch, especially\r\nwhen new cut (about one-third less weight than the evergreen coniferæ),\r\ngives a facility to the loading and carriage, which enhances its value,\r\nindependent of its greater strength and durability. Those larches in\r\nwhich rot has commenced, are fully as suitable for paling as the sound:\r\nthey have fewer circles of sap-wood, and more of red or matured. When\r\nthe rot has commenced, the maturing or reddening of the circles does\r\nnot proceed regularly, reaching nearest the bark on the side where the\r\nrot has advanced farthest.\r\n\r\nA great amelioration of our climate and of our soil, and considerable\r\naddition to the beauty and salubrity of the country, might be\r\nattained by {89} landholders of skill and spirit, did they carry\r\noff the noxious moisture, by sufficient use of open drainage, from\r\ntheir extensive wastes of mossy moors and wet tills, which are only\r\nproductive of the black heath, the most dismal robe[21] of the\r\nearth, or rather the funeral pall with which Nature has shrouded her\r\nundecayed remains. This miserable portion of our country, so dreary\r\nwhen spread out in wide continuous flats, and so offensive to the eye\r\nof the traveller, unless his mind is attuned to gloom and desolation,\r\nlies a disgrace to the possessor. Were a proper system of superficial\r\ndraining executed on these districts, and kept in repair, most of our\r\nconifers, particularly spruce and Scots fir, with oak, beech, birch,\r\nalder, and, in the sounder situations, larch, would thrive and come to\r\nmaturity, ultimately enhancing the value of the district an hundred\r\nfold. This could be done by fluting the ground, opening large ditches\r\nevery 30, 50, or 100 yards, according to the wetness or closeness of\r\nthe subsoil—the deeper, the more serviceable both in efficacy and\r\ndistance of drainage. These flutes should stretch across the slope with\r\njust sufficient declivity to allow the {90} water to flow off easily,\r\nThe excavated matter should be thrown to the lower side; and when the\r\nwhole, or any part, of the excavation consists of earth or gravel, it\r\nought to be spread over the whole mossy surface, whether the field\r\nbe morass or drier hill-peat: this would be useful in consolidating\r\nit, and in preventing too great exhaustion of moisture in severe\r\ndroughts, from which vegetation in moss-soil suffers so much. Even\r\nthough planting were not intended, this fluting and top-dressing would\r\nfacilitate the raising of the gramineæ. These ditches, when the ground\r\nis not too stoney, or too moist, or containing roots, might be scooped\r\nout, excepting a little help at the bottom, by means of a scoop-sledge,\r\nor levelling box, worked by a man and two horses, the surface being\r\nalways loosened by the common plough: one of these will remove earth as\r\nfast as twenty men with wheelbarrows.\r\n\r\n\r\nON BENDING AND KNEEING LARCH.\r\n\r\nWe cannot too forcibly inculcate the urgent necessity of attending to\r\nthe bending of the larch: for our country’s interest, we almost regret\r\nwe cannot compel it. In all larch plantations, in proper {91} soil,\r\nnot too far advanced, and in all that may hereafter be planted, a\r\nproportion of those intended to remain as standards should be bended.\r\nThe most proper time for this would perhaps be May or June, before the\r\ntop-growth commences, or has advanced far; the best size is from three\r\nfeet high and upwards. The plants should be bent the first season to an\r\nangle of from 40° to 60° with the horizon, and the next brought down\r\nto from 10° to 60°, according to the size of the plant, or the curve\r\nrequired,—the smallest plants to the lowest angle.\r\n\r\nFrom experience we find that the roots of larch form the best of all\r\nknees; they, however, might be much improved by culture[22], although\r\nit does not {92} seem as yet to have been attempted or thought of. To\r\nform the roots properly into knees, should the plants be pretty large,\r\nthe planter ought to select those plants which have four main roots\r\nspringing out nearly at right angles, the regularity of which he may\r\nimprove a little by pruning, and plant them out as standards in the\r\nthinnest dryest soil suited for larch, carefully spreading the roots to\r\nequal distances and in a horizontal position. To promote the regular\r\nsquare diverging of these four roots, he should dig narrow ruts about\r\na foot deep and three feet long out from the point of each root, and\r\nfill them in with the richest of the neighbouring turf along with a\r\nlittle manure. When the plants are small, and the roots only a tuft of\r\nfibres, he should dig two narrow ruts about eight feet long crossing\r\neach other at the middle at right angles, fill these as above, and put\r\nin the plant at the crossing: the rich mould of the rotted turf and its\r\nsoftness from being dug, will cause the plant to throw out its roots in\r\nthe form of a cross along the trenches. When the plants have reached\r\nfive or six feet in height, the earth may be removed a little from\r\nthe root, and, if more than one stout root leader have run out into\r\nany of the four trenches, or if any have entered the unstirred earth,\r\nthey ought all to be cut excepting one, the stoutest {93} and most\r\nregular in each trench. In a few years afterwards, when the plants have\r\nacquired some strength, the earth should be removed gradually, baring\r\nthe roots to from two to five feet distance from the stool, or as far\r\nas the main spurs have kept straight, cutting off any side-shoots\r\nwithin this distance, should it be found that such late root-pruning\r\ndoes not induce rot. This process of baring the roots will scarcely\r\ninjure the growth of the trees, as the roots draw the necessary pabulum\r\nfrom a considerable distance, nor, if done carefully, will it endanger\r\ntheir upsetting; and the roots, from exposure to the air, will swell\r\nto extraordinary size[23], so as to render them, ere long, the firmest\r\nrooted trees in the wood. The labour of this not amounting to the\r\nvalue of sixpence each, will be counterbalanced thrice {94} over by\r\nthe ease of grubbing the roots for knees; and the whole brought to the\r\nshipwright will produce more than double the price that the straight\r\ntree alone would have done.\r\n\r\n_The forester should also examine and probe the roots of his growing\r\nlarch, even those of considerable size, in sound ground; and when\r\nseveral strong horizontal spurs, not exceeding four, are discovered\r\nnearly straight, and from two to five feet long, he ought to bare these\r\nroots to that distance, that they may swell, carefully pruning away any\r\nsmall side-roots, and reserve these plants as valuable store_, taking\r\ngood heed that no cart-wheel in passing, or feet of large quadruped,\r\nwound the bared roots. In exposed situations the earth may be gradually\r\nremoved from the roots.\r\n\r\nThe rot in larch taking place in the part appropriate to knees, the\r\nforester cannot be too wary in selecting the situations where there is\r\nno risk of its attack, for planting those destined for this purpose. It\r\nis also desirable, if possible, to have the knee timber in ground free\r\nof stones or gravel, as the grubbing in stoney ground is expensive, and\r\nthe roots often embrace stones which, by the future swelling of the\r\nbulb, are completely imbedded and shut up in the wood, particularly\r\nin those places between the spurs {95} where the saw section has to\r\ndivide them for knees. Were the roots carefully bared at an early\r\nperiod, it would tend to prevent the gravel from becoming imbedded in\r\nthe bulb. Nothing can be more annoying to the shipwright, when he has\r\nbestowed his money, ingenuity, and labour, upon an unwieldy root, and\r\nbrought his knees into figure at the cost of the destruction of his\r\ntools by the enveloped gravel, to discover stains of incipient rot\r\nwhich renders it lumber.\r\n\r\nThis plan of baring the roots might be extended to oak trees for knees,\r\nbaring and pruning about a foot out from the bulb annually. By exposure\r\nto the air, the timber of the root would mature and become red wood\r\nof sufficient durability. When covered with earth, the root of the\r\noak remains white or sap wood, and soon decays after being dug up,\r\nthe matured wood of the stem scarcely extending at all underneath the\r\nsurface of the ground. The roots of the pine tribe are the reverse of\r\nthis, at least the bulb and the spurs near it, are the best matured,\r\nreddest, toughest, most resinous, part of the tree. It is probably\r\nunnecessary to observe, that it would be folly to remove the earth from\r\nthe bulb of trees in situations where water would stand for any length\r\nof time in the excavation. {96}\r\n\r\n_Larch knees are possessed of such strength and durability, and are of\r\nsuch adaptation by their figure and toughness, that were a sufficient\r\nquantity in the market, and their qualities generally known, we\r\nbelieve that none else would be used for vessels of any description of\r\ntimber—even for our war-navy of oak._ In America, where it is difficult\r\nto procure good oak knees in their close forest, it is customary to\r\nuse them of spruce roots even for their finest vessels. The knees of\r\nvessels have a number of strong bolts, generally of iron, passing\r\nthrough them to secure the beam-ends to the sides of the ship. Larch\r\nknees are the more suited for this, as they do not split in the driving\r\nof the bolts, and contain a resinous gum which prevents the oxidation\r\nof the iron.\r\n\r\nAs the larch, unlike the oak, affords few or no crooks naturally,\r\nexcepting knees, the artificial formation of larch crooks is of the\r\nutmost consequence to the interest of the holders of larch plantations\r\nnow growing. In order to obtain a good market for their straight\r\ntimber, it is absolutely necessary to have a supply of crooks ready\r\nas soon as possible to work the straight up. This would increase the\r\ndemand, and thence enhance the price of the straight more than any one\r\nnot belonging to the craft could {97} believe. In good soil many of\r\nthe crooks would be of sufficient size in twenty years to begin the\r\nsupply, if properly thinned out. In a forest of larch containing many\r\nthousand loads, and which had been untouched by any builder, we have\r\nseen the greatest difficulty in procuring crooks for one small brig.\r\nIt is only on very steep ground, and where the tree has been a little\r\nupset after planting, that any good crooks are found. From the rather\r\ngreater diameter required of larch timbers, and also from the nature of\r\nthe fibre of the wood, we should suppose that steam bending of larch\r\ntimbers would scarcely be followed, even as a _dernier ressort_.\r\n\r\nLarch, from its great lateral toughness, particularly the root, and\r\nfrom its lightness, seems better adapted for the construction of\r\nshot-proof vessels than any other timber; and opposed _end-way_ to shot\r\nin a layer, arch fashion, several feet deep around a vessel, would\r\nsustain more battering than any other subject we are acquainted with,\r\nmetal excepted. Were the part above water of a strong steam-vessel,\r\nhaving the paddles under cover, a section of a spheroid or half egg\r\ncut longitudinally, and covered all around with the root cuts of larch\r\nfive or six feet deep with the hewn down bulb, external; well supported\r\n{98} inside, having nothing exposed outside of this arch, and only a\r\nfew small holes for ventilators and eyes; there is no shot in present\r\nnaval use that would have much impression upon it. Had such a vessel\r\na great impelling power, and a very strong iron cutwater, or short\r\nbeak wedge-shaped (in manner of the old Grecian galleys), projecting\r\nbefore the vessel under water, well supported within by beams radiating\r\nback in all directions, she might be wrought to split and sink a fleet\r\nof men-of-war lying becalmed, in a few hours. This could be done\r\nby running successively against each, midships, and on percussion\r\nimmediately backing the engine, at same time spouting forth missiles,\r\nhot water, or sulphuric acid from the bow to obstruct boarding; but\r\neven though the external arch were covered with assailants like a\r\nswarm of bees, they would be harmless, or could be easily displaced.\r\nTo prevent combustion by red hot shot, the larch blocks, after drying,\r\nmight have their pores filled by pressure with alkali. However, the\r\nemployment of bomb-cannon about to be introduced in naval warfare,\r\nthrowing explosive shot, regulated with just sufficient force to\r\npenetrate without passing through the side of the opposed vessel, will\r\nrender any other than metallic defensive cover ineffectual; but {99}\r\nthis circumstance will, at the same time, completely revolutionize sea\r\naffairs, laying on the shelf our huge men-of-war, whose place will be\r\noccupied with numerous bomb-cannon boats, whose small size will render\r\nthem difficult to be hit, and from which one single explosive shot\r\ntaking effect low down in the large exposed side of a three decker will\r\ntear open a breach sufficient to sink her almost instantly. _For the\r\nconstruction of these boats, larch, especially were a proportion bent,\r\nwould be extremely suitable, and thence larch will probably, ere long,\r\nbecome our naval stay._\r\n\r\nLarch has been used in the building-yards of the Tay for 20 years back;\r\nand there is now afloat several thousand tons of shipping constructed\r\nof it. The Athole Frigate built of it nearly 12 years ago, the Larch, a\r\nfine brig built by the Duke of Athole several years earlier, and many\r\nother vessels built more recently, prove that larch is as valuable\r\nfor naval purposes as the most sanguine had anticipated. The first\r\ninstance we have heard of British larch being used in this manner, was\r\nin a sloop repaired with it about 22 years back. The person to whom it\r\nhad belonged, and who had sailed it himself, stated to us immediately\r\nafter its loss, that this sloop had been built of oak about 36 years\r\nbefore; that at 18 years {100} old her upper timbers were so much\r\ndecayed as to require renewal, which was done with larch; that 18 years\r\nafter this repair this sloop went to pieces on the remains of the\r\npier of Methel, Fifeshire, and the top timbers and second foot-hooks\r\nof larch were washed ashore as tough and sound as when first put into\r\nthe vessel, not one spot of decay appearing, they having assumed the\r\nblue dark colour which some timber acquires in moist situations, when\r\nit may be stiled _cured_; being either no longer liable to the putrid\r\nchange constituting dry rot, or which forms timber into a proper\r\nsoil for the growth of dry rot; or, from this blueness caused by the\r\nunion of the tannin with iron acting as a poison on vegetation: this\r\nblueness, resulting from some alteration in the balance of affinities,\r\noccurs chiefly in timber containing much of the tannin principle, in\r\nwhich larch abounds. The owner of a larch brig who had employed her\r\nfor several years on tropical voyages, also assures us that the timber\r\nwill wear well in any climate, and that he would prefer larch to any\r\nother kind of wood, especially for small vessels; he also states that\r\nthe deck of this brig, composed of larch plank, stood the tropical heat\r\nwell, and that it did not warp or shrink as was apprehended.\r\n\r\nFrom the softness of the fibre and want of {101} density of the larch,\r\nwe would not deem it suitable for planking vessels beyond the size\r\nof ordinary merchantmen, say 500 tons, as in the straining of very\r\nlarge vessels, when the greatest force comes upon the outward skin,\r\nthe fabric of the wood might crush before it, along the edge of the\r\nplank, and throw (chew) the oakum. In ordinary sized vessels, however,\r\nlarch plank retains the oakum better than oak, from greater lateral\r\nelasticity. For the purpose of timbers, if root-cuts[24], and properly\r\nbent, we would think larch suitable to the largest class of vessels;\r\nas, though light, it is tough and quite free from knot, crack, or\r\ncross-grain, which is so common in oak, and which occasions dense old\r\noak in large masses to give way at once, before a shock or strain,\r\nthe hardness and unyielding nature of the fibre concentrating the\r\nwhole dirupting impetus to one point. Larch may also be advantageously\r\nemployed in the ceiling or inside skin of the part of war vessels\r\nabove water: shot bores it, comparatively, like an auger,—thence the\r\nstructure will endure longer under fire, and life be much economized.\r\n\r\nIn all places where larch has become known, it has completely\r\nsuperseded other timber for {102} clinker-built boats, surpassing all\r\nothers in strength, lightness, and durability. For this purpose, young\r\ntrees of about 9 inches diameter, in root-cuts from 10 to 20 feet in\r\nlength, with a gentle bend at one end, such as the larch often receives\r\nfrom the south-west wind, are the most suitable. The log should be\r\nkept in the bark till used, and in dry weather the boards put upon the\r\nboat’s side within two or three days from being sawn out, as no timber\r\nwe are acquainted with parts sooner with its moisture than larch; and\r\nthe boards do not work or bend pleasantly when dry. When dried, the\r\nthin larch board is at once strong, tough, durable, and extremely\r\nlight. The tough strength, almost equalling leather, is owing to the\r\nwoven or netted structure of the fibre of the wood, entirely different\r\nfrom the pine, whose reedy structure runs parallel with very slight\r\nconnecting or diverging fibres. It is very difficult to split larch\r\neven by wedges.\r\n\r\nFor rural purposes generally, larch is incomparably the best adapted\r\ntimber, especially for rail or fence, or out-door fabric exposed\r\nto wind and weather. It is also getting into use for implements of\r\nhusbandry, such as harrows, ploughs, and carts. We have seen a larch\r\nupright paling, the timber of which, with the exception of the large\r\ncharred posts, {103} had only been eight years in growing, standing a\r\ngood fence, sixteen years old, decked out by moss and lichen in all the\r\nhoary garniture of time.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of buildings, larch is valuable only for the\r\ngrosser parts, as beams, lintels, joists, couples. For the finer\r\nboarded part, it is so much disposed to warp, and so difficult to be\r\nworked, as generally to preclude use. It is, however, asserted that if\r\nlarch be seasoned by standing two years with the bark stripped from\r\nthe bole before being cut down, that the timber becomes manageable for\r\nfiner house work.\r\n\r\nAlthough larch timber be extremely durable in exposed situation, yet\r\nit yields to the depredations of insects fully as soon as any pine\r\ntimber in close houses. We have proof of it in house-furniture about 50\r\nyears old, but it is considerably moth-eaten by apparently a smaller\r\ninsect than common. Larch stools also disappear in forests sooner than\r\nthe stools of Scots fir, being eaten by a species of beetle; and the\r\nsea-worm devours larch in preference to almost any other wood.\r\n\r\nWe have looked over some experiments conducted at Woolwich, in trial\r\nof the comparative strength of larch and other fir timber, where the\r\nlarch is stated inferior to Riga and Dantzic fir, Pitch pine, {104}\r\nand even Yellow pine. Larch, in the districts of Scotland where it\r\nis grown and much in use, is universally allowed to be considerably\r\nstronger than other fir; and the sawyers of it have one-fourth more pay\r\nper stated measure. We, ourselves, have had considerable experience\r\nof the strength of larch applied to many purposes, and have found it\r\nin general much superior in strength to other fir. We have known a\r\ncrooked topmast of this timber, to which the sailors bore a grudge,\r\ndefy their utmost ingenuity to get carried away. We once had four\r\ndouble horse-carts, made (excepting the wheels) of peeled young larch\r\nof rather slow growth, for the carriage of large stones; these, by\r\nmistake, were made very slight, so light, that, without the wheels, a\r\nman could have carried one of them away. When we saw the first loading\r\nof stones nearly a ton weight each, two in each cart, and the timber\r\nyielding and creaking like a willow-basket, we did not expect they\r\nwould have supported the weight and jostlings of a rugged road many\r\nyards; yet they withstood this coarse employment for a long time. The\r\ntimber of larch near the top of the tree is, however, very inferior and\r\ndeficient in toughness; and it is not improbable that the experiments\r\nabove alluded to at Woolwich had been made with larch {105} timber\r\ndeficient in strength from being a top. White larch has comparatively\r\nsmaller and more numerous branches than any other of the Coniferæ;\r\nconsequently the timber is freer of large knots, and has more equable\r\nstrength, as well in small spars as when large and cut out into joists\r\nand beams, provided the timber be not too far up the tree. _Larch,\r\nhowever, compared with pines and firs, has the timber much stronger\r\nwhen young, and several inches or below a foot in diameter, than when\r\nold and large_: this may partly be owing to its deficiency in resinous\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDNOTES TO PART II.\r\n\r\n[10] We have often preferred the terms kind, breed, family, individual,\r\nto genus, species, variety, subvariety, as the former seem less\r\ndefinite. Were nature true to the latter classification as employed by\r\nbotanists, it would be convenient.\r\n\r\n[11] In those we observed, we considered this last circumstance had a\r\nconsiderable share as a predisposing cause of the attack of the worm.\r\nForests of _Pinus sylvestris_ are sometimes destroyed by insects under\r\nthe bark, in cases where it is difficult to decide whether external\r\ncircumstances, such as a dry warm season, has been promotive of the\r\nincrease of the insect itself, or has induced some disorder in the\r\nplant, rendering the juices more suitable aliment to the worm.\r\n\r\n[12] Some nautical or technical terms have unavoidably crept into\r\nthis work; we shall not presume to think any explanation necessary:\r\nBritannia would blush _jusqu’au blanc des yeux_, to the _tips_ of the\r\nfingers and toes, did she think it were doubted that any of her sons,\r\nnot doomed to unceasing mechanical labour, were unacquainted with these.\r\n\r\n[13] It is termed by our professors _Salix fragilis_, or Crack Willow,\r\nfrom the small branches breaking easily at the junction of the annual\r\ngrowth—or, perhaps, Crack Willow, from the branches breaking with\r\nconsiderable report; or from the wood, while burning, frequently\r\ndetonating or crackling, from the expansion of some aërial fluid within\r\nthe fibres. Though named by their sapience _fragilis_, it is not weaker\r\nthan other large growing willows, but stronger and denser; and, being\r\nharder in the small branches, they do not bend, but break when their\r\nbark and alburnum is driest, in winter. The timber is superior to that\r\nof _Salix alba_, or of any other large growing willow we are acquainted\r\nwith, and is sufficiently pliant and tough.\r\n\r\n[14] Red Canadian pine is generally termed _Pinus resinosa_; but as\r\nit is not so resinous as several other kinds, we consider _Pinus\r\nrubra_ (_rubra_ from the colour of stem and also of timber), which is\r\nsometimes used, more suitable. The pitch pine of the American United\r\nStates should be _Pinus resinosa_.\r\n\r\n[15] We think that in mankind the variations of the children of the\r\nsame parents do not soften entirely—there would seem to be certain\r\ntypes or nuclei both of appearance and temperament around which\r\nexternal and internal character vibrates.\r\n\r\n[16] The Canadian red pine resembles P. sylvestris or Norway pine so\r\nmuch, that it is usually styled Norway pine by the settlers: Though\r\ndifferent, it is so nearly allied to P. sylvestris, that we consider\r\nthe number of sap-growths may be referred to the climate and soil, and\r\nnot to the kind,—that is, that, were it grown in Britain, if it did not\r\nat first, it would in the course of time come to have fewer sap-growths.\r\n\r\n[17] Our common larch, like almost every other kind of tree, consists\r\nof numberless varieties, which differ considerably in quickness of\r\ngrowth, ultimate size, and value of timber. This subject has been\r\nmuch neglected. We are, however, on the eve of great improvements in\r\narboriculture; the qualities and habits of varieties are just beginning\r\nto be studied. It is also found that the uniformity in each kind of\r\nwild growing plants called _species_, may be broken down by art or\r\nculture, and that when once a breach is made, there is almost no limit\r\nto disorder; the _mele_ that ensues being nearly incapable of reduction.\r\n\r\n[18] There is yet no sufficient data for the term alpine plant, but\r\nwith reference to latitude. The influence on vegetables, arising from\r\nrarefaction and diminution of pressure of atmosphere, from difference\r\nof stimulus of solar ray—when the entire ray of light, heat, and\r\nchemical power, though less intense, is radiated fresh, and not much\r\nbroken or modified by refraction and reflection, and heat communicated\r\nmore in proportion by radiation than by contact of heated air; or\r\nfrom difference of electric or galvanic or other meteoric impression\r\nconnected with altitude or ranges of mountains, or with primary rocks\r\nor more upright strata, has not been made the subject of research, at\r\nleast has not been sufficiently investigated by any naturalist.\r\n\r\n[19] When water is stationary, either in the pores of the soil or by\r\nitself, if the temperature be not very low, a slight putrefaction\r\ngenerally commences, aided by the dead vegetable or animal matter\r\ncontained in the soil or the water; and it is only the more robust\r\naquatic vegetables whose juices are not corrupted, from their roots\r\nbeing soaked in this tainted fluid. It would appear, too, that the\r\naqueous part of the atmosphere is also susceptible of the same putrid\r\nchanges, although in general the putrescency may have commenced before\r\nthe evaporation. This condition of the aqueous part of the atmosphere\r\nis a disposing cause to blight or mildew in vegetables, and remittent,\r\nintermittent, and putrid fevers in man. Mill-ponds are notorious both\r\nfor mildew and agues.\r\n\r\n[20] We have had no experience of larch, excepting very young, growing\r\non chalk and its affinities. We are told there are a few instances\r\nwhere larch has reached 50 years in these calcareous soils, some\r\ndistance south of London. This merits attention.\r\n\r\n[21] “Oh! the bonny blooming heather.”—“Man has spoken evil things of\r\nthe sun, of love, and of life.”\r\n\r\n[22] As we held this plan of forming larch knees, and of bending\r\nlarch, of considerable importance, we some time ago presented it in\r\nmanuscript, along with some other matter, to the Highland Society\r\nof Scotland. Tiring, however, of the delay of examination, perhaps\r\nunavoidable in their official departments, and from some improvements\r\noccurring to us during the delay, we requested it back. We now present\r\nit under this more convenient form to the Society, and hope they\r\nwill find the examination or perusal of it printed, not quite so\r\nimpracticable as when in manuscript. It will afford us pleasure to\r\nknow that this useful Society approves, and that the members who have\r\nopportunity are setting about following our directions. We especially\r\nrecommend to them to probe the roots of their growing larch, and to lay\r\nbare those fitted for knees.\r\n\r\n[23] The landlord agriculturist is sufficiently aware of the influence\r\nof the baring the upper part of the root of turnip, while the plant\r\nis young, in extending the future growth of the bulb, and that a dry\r\nsituation gives most root in proportion to stem. These are general laws\r\nin vegetation. There are few observers who have not remarked the very\r\nlarge size which roots have attained when the trees have originally\r\nbeen planted on dikes, and the dike earth removed, leaving the roots\r\nbare. Should any person examine the very great difference of thickness\r\nbetween the upper and lower part, from the heart of a root near the\r\nbulb, he will at once discover the influence of exposure to the air and\r\nfreeness from pressure in promoting the swelling.\r\n\r\n[24] As you ascend the tree the timber deteriorates greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{106} PART III.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS MATTER CONNECTED WITH NAVAL TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSERIES.\r\n\r\nMuch of the luxuriance and size of timber depending upon the particular\r\nvariety of the species, upon the treatment of the seed before sowing,\r\nand upon the treatment of the young plant, and as this fundamental\r\nsubject is neither much attended to nor generally understood, we shall\r\ntake it up _ab initio_.\r\n\r\nThe consequences are now being developed of our deplorable ignorance\r\nof, or inattention to, one of the most evident traits of natural\r\nhistory, that vegetables as well as animals are generally liable to\r\nan almost unlimited diversification, regulated by climate, soil,\r\nnourishment, and new commixture of already formed varieties. In those\r\nwith which man is most intimate, and where his agency in throwing\r\nthem from their natural locality and dispositions has brought out\r\nthis power of diversification in stronger shades, it has been forced\r\nupon his notice, as in man himself, in the dog, horse, cow, sheep,\r\npoultry,—in the apple, {107} pear, plum, gooseberry, potato, pea,\r\nwhich sport in infinite varieties, differing considerably in size,\r\ncolour, taste, firmness of texture, period of growth, almost in\r\nevery recognisable quality. In all these kinds man is influencial in\r\npreventing deterioration, by careful selection of the largest or most\r\nvaluable as breeders; but in timber trees the opposite course has\r\nbeen pursued. The large growing varieties being so long of coming to\r\nproduce seed, that many plantations are cut down before they reach this\r\nmaturity, the small growing and weakly varieties, known by early and\r\nextreme seeding, have been continually selected as reproductive stock,\r\nfrom the ease and conveniency with which their seed could be procured;\r\nand the husks of several kinds of these invariably kiln-dried[25], in\r\norder that the seeds might be the more easily extracted! May we, then,\r\nwonder that our plantations are occupied by a sickly short-lived puny\r\nrace, incapable of supporting existence in situations where their own\r\nkind had formerly flourished—particularly evinced in the genus {108}\r\nPinus, more particularly in the species Scots fir; so much inferior\r\nto those of Nature’s own rearing, where only the stronger, more hardy,\r\nsoil-suited varieties can struggle forward to maturity and reproduction?\r\n\r\nWe say that the rural economist should pay as much regard to the breed\r\nor particular variety of his forest trees, as he does to that of his\r\nlive stock of horses, cows, and sheep. That nurserymen should attest\r\nthe variety of their timber plants, sowing no seeds but those gathered\r\nfrom the largest, most healthy, and luxuriant growing trees, abstaining\r\nfrom the seed of the prematurely productive, and also from that of\r\nthe very aged and over-mature; as they, from animal analogy, may be\r\nexpected to give an infirm progeny, subject to premature decay.\r\n\r\nAs, from many facts, a considerable influence is known to result in\r\nseveral vegetables from drying severely the seeds from whence they\r\nhad sprung[26],—from exposure of these seeds to the sun and air,—from\r\nlong keeping, or from injury by mould or {109} impure air, which all\r\ntend to shorten the life of the resulting individual, to accelerate\r\nthe period of its seeding, and to increase its reproductiveness; the\r\nnurseryman should pay the utmost attention to the seeds he makes use\r\nof, procuring them as recent as possible, and preserving them in\r\nwell-aired lofts, or under sheds, and also retaining them in the husks\r\ntill the time of sowing: the superior germinating power of the seed\r\nthus treated will repay this attention.\r\n\r\nFrom facts we are also assured, that, in some hard wood kinds,\r\nand also in the Coniferæ, the hanging of the growth of the young\r\nplant, the spindling up in the seed-bed, or injudicious deterring\r\ntreatment afterwards, have a tendency to injure the constitution of\r\nthe individual, inducing premature seeding, and diminutive old age;\r\nand also, that when plants, especially of some size, of these kinds\r\nof trees have their roots much broken, the secondary or new roots\r\noften partake something of the nature of the infirm runners, which,\r\nin most kinds of trees, are thrown out by layers,—the resulting tree,\r\nas in the case of those from layers in fruit trees being dwarfish,\r\nsooner exhausting itself by reproduction, and sooner decaying. For\r\ndistinctness, we shall recapitulate: {110}\r\n\r\nThat the seed be from the largest, hardiest variety of tree in\r\nluxuriant growth.\r\n\r\nThat the seed be recent, and carefully preserved in husk till sowing,\r\nand extracted from the husk or cone without artificial drying.\r\n\r\nThat the nursery be in an open, rather exposed situation,—most eligible\r\nwithout shelter either of tree, hedge or wall, of rather light dry soil\r\nof ordinary quality, of dry climate, and, in preference, soil naturally\r\ngood to that made so by high manuring.\r\n\r\nThat the plants be not too close, nor remain too long in the seed-bed;\r\nthat they be extricated without much fracture of root, and be replanted\r\nin wide rows, with good space between the plants in the row, keeping\r\nthe roots as superficially extended as they will thrive, and without\r\ndoubling the main root up to the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThat the plant receive no pruning, excepting in the case of more than\r\none leader appearing, or feeder unproportionally extended; and no\r\nroot-section, in order to retard its growth, or increase the number of\r\nroot-fibres; and that its ultimate removal be accomplished without much\r\nfracture of root or branch.\r\n\r\nBy exposed situation of nursery, ordinary quality of soil, and much\r\nroom in the seed-bed and rows, we {111} shall have plants with firm\r\nfibre and hardy constitution, with thick juicy bark, thick stem at the\r\nsurface of ground, and numerous feeders all the way down the stem.\r\nRoots are most easily extricated from light soil, and with least\r\nfracture. They are large in proportion to stem in dry soil and climate,\r\nand when they are situated near the surface of the ground.—A healthy\r\ngrowing plant, of firm fibre, large root, and sturdy short stem of one\r\nleader and numerous feeders, is the great desideratum: a large root is\r\nthe more desirable, as a considerable part of it is generally broken\r\noff in transplanting, rendering it disproportioned to the top, which,\r\nin consequence, either languishes, or receives deterring cropping.\r\n\r\nWe consider, that a tree grows more luxuriantly, acquires larger size,\r\nand is much longer of reaching senility, when it is furnished with\r\nseveral large roots, say one or two to each of the cardinal points,\r\nextending horizontally out with bold leaders, than when numerous small\r\nrootlets diverge in all directions from the bulb, as is the case\r\nin some kinds when much fracture of root takes place from frequent\r\nremovals, or, when the nursery is of moist or mossy soil, the plants\r\nbeing removed when of considerable size. We have cut down old stunted\r\nhard wood trees having extremely numerous crowded roots, all {112}\r\nengrafted into a matted net throughout the soil near the bulb, and\r\nwithout any strong extended leaders. We attributed this crowded rooting\r\nto the plants having been of considerable size when put in, and losing\r\ntheir natural leaders; the situation, an avenue exposed to cattle, went\r\nto confirm the probability that the defect of the rooting had been\r\nowing to the largeness of the plants.\r\n\r\nWhen a tree is supplied by numerous, consequently small and not\r\nwide-extending roots, as the tree acquires size, the wide spreading\r\nbranches and leafy top shed off the rain and dews from the space\r\noccupied by these roots, very few of them extending beyond this shade;\r\nat the same time, this narrow space becomes soon exhausted of the more\r\nparticular pabulum necessary to the kind of plant, the exhaustion\r\nbeing accelerated by the dryness. This dryness and exhaustion of the\r\nsoil very soon show their effects aloft; the living hark of the tree\r\nbecomes covered from its connexion with the air, and constricted by a\r\nthick hard dead crust, which, with the consequent very thin alburnum\r\naffording an inefficient communication between the supply and demand,\r\nreact to impair the general vigour, and particularly to impede the\r\ndescent of the proper sap necessary to the enlargement and further\r\nextension of the roots. The buds {113} not receiving sufficient supply\r\nof root-moisture, instead of pressing on to new formation of wood, only\r\nfind enough to burgeon out into flower-buds, which the following season\r\ndrain the tree by reproduction; this fruit-bearing alternates with\r\nperiods of exhaustion, when the buds have not even supply sufficient to\r\nswell into the embryo of flower and seed, but extend only into a few\r\nleaves; and sometimes, in the event of a benign season, the buds may\r\nthrow out a small extension of new shoots. The tree progresses very\r\nslowly in thickness of bole all this time, and generally soon falls a\r\nprey to disease. On the other hand, when the tree has its naturally\r\nfine large roots preserved, and is situated in open forest, and mixed\r\nwith other kinds, these large roots diverging widely from the tree and\r\neach other, have a much larger less-sought space to forage in; and the\r\ntree enjoying a long period of luxuriant growth before it fall much\r\ninto seed-bearing, acquires strength of constitution to thrive and\r\nincrease for ages under this drain.\r\n\r\nWe are satisfied that cutting or fracture of the root-leaders,\r\nespecially near the bulb, when they have acquired some size, is\r\ninjurious to the extension and longevity of the tree, in pines and most\r\nkinds of hard wood; and that branch-pruning, as generally practised,\r\nis not less pernicious, first, by the {114} derangement which the\r\nplant receives, from the regular connexion between the rootlets and\r\ntheir affiliated twigs and leaves being destroyed by the section,\r\nand afterwards from the distance between the manufacturing parts,\r\nthe leaves and the sources of supply in the ground being unnaturally\r\nextended, especially when the stem is long, slender, and much denuded.\r\n\r\nAlthough we consider severe root fracture at planting pernicious to\r\nsome hard wood and resinous trees, yet there are kinds to which it\r\nis advantageous. All plants which grow freely by cuttings, strike\r\nbetter to have the roots pruned in near to the bulb. Many kinds\r\nof seedling-plants also strike sooner, and throw out stronger new\r\nroot-leaders, when the long straggling fibres are cut in a little,\r\nsimilar to the branches above, which, when over-numerous and slender,\r\nthrow out more vigorous shoots by being cropped at planting.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING.\r\n\r\nIn regard to planting, soils divide into the _dry_ and the _moist_;\r\nthe former require to have the plants put in as soon as possible after\r\nthe leaves drop off—at any rate, not to allow February to pass without\r\ncompleting the planting; excepting evergreens, {115} which should not\r\nbe delayed beyond the middle of April. In dry soils, if the expense\r\nbe not limited to a very low rate, pit-planting should be adopted,\r\nand the pits are better to be dug some months previous, in order\r\nthat the earth may be aërated, and the turf partly rotted. The moist\r\nsoils may be divided into those which are much disposed to throw the\r\nplant from the frosts and thaws, and those which are not; the former\r\nconsisting of moory, soft, or spongy earth, upon a retentive subsoil;\r\nthe latter, of the firmer, more equable loams, clays, and tills. Unless\r\nthe plants are large, they should always be slitted into the former\r\nsoil, and the work performed as soon as the ground becomes sadded in\r\nspring—as, though the lateness of planting should preclude throwing of\r\npitted plants the first season, they will often be thrown the ensuing\r\nwinter. When plants are very small, they may be put into the latter,\r\nby slitting; but if middle-sized, or large, they are better pitted. It\r\nis of the greatest importance to these moist soils, to have very deep,\r\nopen[27] drains executed previous to planting, cutting off all the\r\nsprings at their sources, and, if possible, drying the subsoil to such\r\na degree that water will not stand in the pits. Should this be {116}\r\naccomplished, it is highly advantageous to dig the pits in time for\r\nthe excavated clay to have its cohesion broken by frost: the planting\r\nshould afterwards be performed exactly at the time when this frosted\r\nmould is sufficiently dry, and no more, to shake conveniently in among\r\nthe fibres of the roots, and not to knead into mortar, by the necessary\r\npressing of the feet. After this pressure, a little of the tenderest of\r\nthe soil should be spread loose over the surface, to exclude drought.\r\nShould this dryness of subsoil not be effected, the pits must be dug\r\nin spring, at the time the clay is most friable; that is, between the\r\nmoist and dry; and the plants put in immediately, breaking the clay as\r\nfine as possible, and closing it well around the roots. It is better to\r\ndelay planting even till May, than to perform it too wet. When planting\r\nis delayed late in spring, the plants should be kept _shoughed_ in the\r\ncoldest situation that can be found, at the top of a hill exposed to\r\nthe north, or in some cold, damp, back-lying place. Care should also\r\nbe taken not to expose them much while planting, as they, especially\r\nif the buds be bursting, very soon wither when root and stem are both\r\nexposed to the sun and dry air. When late planted, they ought always\r\nto be dipped as far up as the branches in a puddle of clay and water:\r\n{117} should they be dipped over head in the puddle, it will not\r\ninjure them.\r\n\r\nWhat is of most importance to the success of planting, is to have the\r\nsoil put very closely in contact with all the root-fibre, and these\r\nfibres in due natural separation, with a little tender mould on the\r\nsurface;—not to have water stagnating around the root, at any rate\r\nduring the first spring;—to have the planting done in time, to receive\r\na good sadding by rain before the spring droughts commence;—to prevent\r\nrank weeds, furze, &c. from smothering the young plants;—and to exclude\r\nor destroy all bestial, as cattle, sheep, rabbits, hares, mice, &c. In\r\nkeeping the latter in check, a few families of foxes are very efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON PRUNING.\r\n\r\nEvery forester is aware, that when feeders are pruned off, they should\r\nbe cut away as close as possible to, and without tearing the hole.\r\nTo perform this without danger of injury to the tree, when feeders\r\nof considerable size are to be removed, the branch should first be\r\nsawn over at about one foot beyond the intended section, and a second\r\nsection then performed at the proper place. This {118} requires a\r\nlittle more time, but not nearly so much as an inexperienced person\r\nwould suppose, as the section a foot out is made very quickly, and the\r\npruner generally takes as much time to reach the branch as to cut it\r\noff. The neatness and advantage of this method will be acknowledged by\r\nthose who have seen it practised, to compensate for the longer time it\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nWe find the saw, shears, and knife, the best instruments for pruning;\r\nin some cases of difficult approach, the long-handed pruning-iron may\r\nbe resorted to. When the lopping is performed by a percussion tool, the\r\nwood and bark at the section is often shattered by the blow, and thence\r\nis less likely to cicatrize soundly; and even when executed in the best\r\nmanner, the surface of the section is smooth and hard, consequently\r\na good conductor of heat, dries much, and thence shrinks and cracks\r\nnear the centre of the cut, opening a deep crevice, into which the\r\nrain penetrates, and often rots deep into the stem. When the section\r\nis made by the saw, a slight fibrous clothing is left upon the place,\r\nwhich in some measure protects the ends of the cut tubes from the frost\r\nand drying air, and excludes the heat; in consequence the wood at the\r\nsection does not lose its vitality so far inward, and is not so liable\r\nto shrink {119} and crack in the centre and receive rain. The section\r\ncan also generally be made much neater and closer by the saw than by\r\nany other instrument. The common erroneous belief, that a section by\r\na sharp-edged instrument is less injurious than by the saw, is merely\r\nhypothetical, from wide analogy from animals. The pernicious influence\r\non the whole individual, received and transmitted by the nerves from\r\nmangled section of animal fibre, is probably entirely awanting in\r\nvegetables; the whole process of life and of cicatrization is also\r\ntotally different.\r\n\r\nThe forester should also be very wary in cutting off a considerable\r\nbranch, whose section would incline upwards, as such a section, when it\r\nhas received a circle of new bark and wood, forms a cup which receives\r\nand contains rain water, which quickly corrupts the bottom of the cup,\r\nand often rots the centre of the tree down to the ground. It is better\r\nto crop such a branch several feet from the main stem, close by some\r\nsmall feeder, unless the branch be dead. In pruning, every considerable\r\nsection should be as near as possible at right angles with the horizon,\r\nor rather inclining inward below. Of naval timber, the beech is by far\r\nthe most likely to take rot by being pruned, and should never have a\r\nlarge limb cut off, as the divided fibres generally die {120} downward\r\na number of feet below the section, and soon afterward decay, leaving a\r\nhole in the bole.\r\n\r\nAs nothing retards the growth of trees more than full flowering and\r\nseeding, if pruning diminish this flowering and seeding, so that the\r\ngain from the prevention of this exhaustion more than counterbalances\r\nthe loss of the pruned-off part, the pruning will of course accelerate\r\nthe growth of the tree; but the removal of lower branches, although in\r\nthe first place promotive of growing buds and extension of the top, in\r\na year or two longer only tends to throw the tree more into flowering\r\nand seeding. The rich dryness, or want of fluidity of the juices which\r\noccasions flower-buds, is also induced by hot, dry atmosphere, and\r\nshort supply of moisture from the roots during the preceding summer,\r\nboth of which disposing causes are increased by a long naked stem.\r\nWhen the proportion of the part above ground of a tree to the roots\r\nis diminished, growing buds result, at least to a certain extent; yet\r\nit would be very difficult to practise a proper system of pruning on\r\nthis principle, as the consequent lengthened stem is, in the end,\r\npromotive of flower-buds, especially in dry seasons, and the loss of\r\nfeeders might greatly counterbalance the gain from not flowering, did a\r\nsuccession of wet cold seasons follow. {121}\r\n\r\nThe season when pruning should be performed, is something dependent\r\nupon the kinds, whether they bleed when pruned in early spring or do\r\nnot. Almost any convenient time will suit for pruning the latter, but\r\nwe rather prefer March, April, May, June, or autumn after the leaf has\r\nfallen. The former, sycamore, maple, birch, &c. ought either to be\r\npruned in autumn, or after the buds are beginning to break in spring,\r\nas they bleed and suffer considerable exhaustion when pruned in the\r\nlatter part of winter or early spring. From some facts, we consider\r\nthat pruning in winter, especially in severe weather, gives a check to\r\nthe vigour of the tree; others agree with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n{122} OBSERVATIONS ON TIMBER.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of measurable wood of the various timber trees which\r\na certain extent of adapted ground will carry, when come to full\r\nmaturity, or when they may be most profitably felled, and the quantity\r\nthat may be thinned out during the maturing, with the time requisite\r\nto bring to value, with the relative selling price per foot, and also\r\nwhether the greatest quantity of timber can be grown of one kind or\r\nmixed, are questions of more importance than might be judged, from\r\nthe attention paid to the subject. Of our common timber trees, Scots\r\nfir, silver fir, and spruce, larch, pinaster, black Italian poplar,\r\nSalix alba, commonly called Huntingdon willow, red-wood willow, beech,\r\nSpanish chestnut, ash, plane, elm, birch, oak, are here ranked nearly\r\nin the order of quantity of measure which adapted ground in this\r\ncountry will produce or support; that is, that an acre of close Scots\r\nfir trees, of whatever age, will admeasure more timber than an acre\r\ncovered with any other tree of the same size; and a close acre of oaks\r\nless. A little further south, in the temperate zone, the large-leaved\r\ndeciduous trees, particularly the {123} elms, acquire thicker and\r\nlonger stem, in closer order, in a given time. In this country, in\r\nrich warm situations, this is visible in some degree, both as regards\r\nquantity of timber and quickness of growth, compared with pines. It\r\nwould be difficult to state the comparative quickness of growth of\r\nthe various timber trees, as so much depends on soil, situation, and\r\ntreatment; it also varies considerably at different stages of their\r\ngrowth. It is well known, that in proper soil, black Italian poplar,\r\nSalix alba, and red wood willow, exceed all others.\r\n\r\nAs, for naval use, it is not the quickness of growth and bulk of\r\nthe timber altogether, but of the matured timber alone, which is of\r\nconsequence—we give a view of the number of growths or annual circles\r\nof sap-wood (the useless part), which the main stems of several kinds\r\nof trees presented. Most of those we examined had a greater number\r\nof sap-layers near the top than at a few feet above ground, and the\r\nvigorous branches had generally more than the stem immediately adjacent\r\nto them; the branches with least vigour had fewest sap circles. {124}\r\n\r\n _Of Home Growth._\r\n\r\n Common oak, some trees               10, others 14, others 18\r\n Spanish chestnut,                     2,         5,         6\r\n Scots elm, _U. montana_,             16,        25,        32\r\n English elm, _U. campestris_,         0,        10,         0\r\n Red-wood willow,                      8,        14,         0\r\n Laburnum,                             3,         5,         0\r\n Wild cherry, _Prunus cerasus_,       16,        24,         0\r\n Black Italian poplar,                 9,         0,         0\r\n Scots fir,                           20,        30,        40\r\n Pinaster,                             0,        10,         0\r\n White larch, free of rot,             5,        12,        18\r\n\r\n _Of Foreign Growth._\r\n\r\n Memel fir,                            0,        43,         0\r\n Red Canadian pine,                    0,       100,         0\r\n Yellow Canadian pine,                38,        44,         0\r\n\r\nThe process of maturing in several did not proceed regularly, some\r\nof the rings being reddened on one side and remaining white on the\r\nother: this did not seem to be influenced by position to south or\r\nnorth. In the larch, particularly in those trees {125} where the rot\r\nis incipient, this maturing is very irregular, in the view of the\r\ncross section dashing out into angles and irregularities, and being\r\ndarker red than in the healthy plants: in those where rot had made\r\nconsiderable progress, the red-wood was within a circle or two of\r\nthe bark. This approach of red-wood to the outside is so regularly\r\nconnected with rot, that we needed no other indication of the roots\r\nbeing unfit for knees, and therefore not worth grubbing, than merely a\r\nslight notch by two cuts of a hatchet.\r\n\r\nThose kinds of timber whose matured wood assumes a brown or reddish\r\ncolour, are generally much less susceptible of change, either by simple\r\nputrefaction or by attack of fungi, or gnawing of insects, than those\r\nwhose matured wood remains of a whitish colour. In many of the latter,\r\nthere does not even appear to be any particular change of constitution,\r\nor greater capability of resisting corruption or insects, between the\r\nalburnum and mature wood, although the difference between the two is\r\ngenerally perceptible when the cross section is drying, and immediate,\r\nas in the brown or red; there being no gradual change or softening in\r\neither between the mature and immature. Although the change in those\r\nwhich become brown and red does not much affect {126} the hardness or\r\nstrength of the timber (mature and immature being nearly equal in these\r\nwhen dried before corruption injures the latter), yet it materially\r\ninfluences its nature or quality. We have taken down Laburnum trees in\r\nthe round natural form from the roofing of an old building, from which\r\nnearly the whole yellow or sap-wood was eaten away by insects, although\r\nthey had not made the least impression upon the brown[28]. {127}\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether timber be more lasting when cut at one time of the season than\r\nat another, is not yet determined. The matured wood does not seem to be\r\nmuch affected by the season, continuing nearly equally moist throughout\r\nthe year; life or action in it, though not quite, being nearly extinct,\r\nand little or no circulation remaining; yet the matured wood of the\r\nstool of the pine throws out a little resin when the tree is cut\r\ndown in summer,—perhaps only a mechanical effect of heat and drying.\r\nSteeping in water for a considerable time is of far more importance\r\nto the duration of timber than any thing depending on the time of the\r\nseason when it is cut down; steeping causes some acetous {128} change\r\nin the timber (easily recognisable by the sense of smelling when any\r\nsection of it is made), which, judging from the effect the acetous\r\nchange has to preserve other vegetable matter from putrefaction, is\r\nprobably of considerable use in preserving the timber from decay,\r\neither by rot or worming. The time of cutting, although of considerable\r\nimportance to the quality and durability of the sap-wood, appears to be\r\nof little or none to the matured.\r\n\r\nThe age at which timber may be cut down being uncertain, the\r\nheight to which it should be trained up of clear stem is not very\r\ndeterminable,—say that the trees are to be allowed to stand till\r\nnearly full grown,—as long as the timber continues to retain its\r\nstrength and toughness when growing in proper soil, that is for\r\nhard-wood trees 100 years and upwards, and for pines from two to three\r\nhundred. On crowns of eminences and exposed bluffs, particularly when\r\nthe latitude or altitude is rather high, the soil inferior, or the\r\nclimate arid, from 15 to 30 feet of clear hole may be as much as can\r\njudiciously be attempted; upon plains under common circumstances,\r\nfrom 30 to 50 feet is an attainable stem; in sheltered dales and\r\nvalleys, they may be trained clean, and without branch, from 50 to\r\n70 feet in altitude; and in cases where soil, situation, {129} and\r\nclimate, are all propitious, and it is desired that nature’s fullest,\r\ngrandest, development should be displayed, from 70 to 150 feet, clear\r\nof branch, maybe gained. Lewis and Clarke describe a spruce, in a\r\nsheltered dell on the river Columbia, which they measured, lying upon\r\nthe ground, 312 feet long from root to top. We have little belonging\r\nto earth more sublime, or which bears home to man a deeper sense of\r\nhis bodily insignificance, and puny transient being, than an ancient\r\nmajestic forest, whose luxuriant foliage on high, seems of itself\r\nalmost a firmament of verdure, supported on lofty moss-covered columns,\r\nand unnumbered branched arches,—a scene equally sublime, whether we\r\nview it under the coloured and flickering lights and shadows of the\r\nsummer eve and morning, resounding to the song of the wild life which\r\nharbours there,—or under the scattered beams streaming downward at\r\nhigh noontide when all is still,—or in winter storms, when the wild\r\njarring commotion, the frightful rending and lashing of the straining\r\nbranches, like the arms of primeval giants, contending in their might,\r\nbear accompaniment to the loud roar and bellow of the tempest, forming\r\na drone and chaunter to which demons might dance.\r\n\r\n\r\n{130} CONCERNING OUR MARINE, &c.\r\n\r\nCan we consider the Briton sane who speaks of bounding this country\r\nto her home resources? Can any one doubt that our name, our wealth,\r\nour power, are not wholly attributable to our _Marine_? Can any one\r\nbe ignorant that the superiority of our marine is wholly dependant on\r\nour _foreign trade_, particularly the bulkier part of it, on _foreign\r\nsupply_? Does any one dread the necessity of _foreign supply_, from the\r\nfoolish fear that it may be cut off by war? Keeping out of view the\r\nargument, that ere the British pride would suffer _other domination\r\non the waters_, our numbers would be well thinned away, they know\r\nlittle of the influence of circumstance on man, who do not perceive\r\nthat, in the event of free trade, and of the population of Britain\r\nincreasing beyond what the country, under the best possible culture,\r\ncould support, the very necessity of being mistress of the seas would\r\nmake her so. They know little of what Britain is, country and people,\r\nwho doubt of her continued supremacy, should she not be ruined,\r\nindeed, by following the narrow selfish {131} views of a party—a\r\nparty alike ungrateful[29] for the past, and blind to, or heedless\r\nof, their own ultimate good. The position of Britain,—her stretch\r\nof sea-coast, serrated with harbours,—her minerals, the principle\r\nof mechanical motion, so necessary in the arts,—her navy, docks,\r\ncanals, roads, implements, and machinery, so superior to those of the\r\nwhole world beside,—her fertile soil,—her capital,—her protection of\r\nproperty,—her insular situation,—her steady government and consequent\r\ningress of capital from the continent on any commotion,—her habits\r\nof industry,—her knowledge of trade,—her sciences,—her arts,—her\r\nfree press,—her {132} religion[30],—and the stamina and indomitable\r\nspirit of her people. All these, causes and effects combined, brought\r\ninto action under a climate the most favourable for developing the\r\nmoral and physical energies of man, where the extremes of temperature\r\nneither relax nor chill, where the human muscle and human mind are more\r\ncapable of continued strong exertion, and machinery less influenced by\r\nhygrometric and calorific change, than on any other spot of earth. When\r\nall these are condensed into a nucleus of power of so small compass\r\nthat one spirit, one interest, may pervade all, but drawing support\r\nby ramifications from every nook of the habitable world, should an\r\ninfatuated party not render unavailable these unmatched advantages,\r\ncowardice could not even dream of peril to the supremacy of British\r\nnaval power.\r\n\r\nLet us continue to extend our foreign intercourse and home\r\ncultivation—let the merchant legislate in affairs of trade—the\r\nlandholder in country matters; each in that in which his judgment\r\nhas been formed by experience, acting always on the principle that\r\nthe general prosperity of the country is the interest {133} of\r\nevery class—that, like the branch and the root, their prosperity is\r\nindissolubly combined.\r\n\r\nWhen we view the advantages of Britain—almost to a wish,—when we view\r\nher able and ready to supply the necessities of man in every clime,\r\nin exchange for his superfluities, and to scatter science, morality,\r\nthe arts of life, all that conduces to happiness and improvement over\r\nthe nations,—when we view all this, being blasted by an exclusive\r\nsystem of monopoly, of very doubtful advantage to one party of the\r\nnation, and tyrannically oppressive upon all others, can we refrain\r\nfrom execration? We would desire the casuist to draw a distinction\r\nbetween the criminality of preventing the operative from exchanging\r\nthe produce of his labour (otherwise unsaleable) for cheap food[31],\r\nwhen his family is famishing; and compelling the labour of the Negro\r\n(whom you support with food) with the whip. Men will be found of a\r\nvirtue sufficiently easy to advocate either system. We only wish that\r\nthe supporters of {134} monopoly and their abettors were sent off to\r\nsome separate quarter of the world with all their beloved restrictions,\r\nduties, tariffs, passports, revenue officers, blockade men, with the\r\ninnumerable petty interfering vexatious regulations, and all the\r\ncontrivances which surely the devil has invented to repress industry\r\nand promote misery, where they might form an Elysium of their own.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more certain, should we by restrictions continue to\r\nbanish knowledge, capital, and industry from our shores[32], than that\r\nthe Genius of Improvement will fix upon some other place for the seat\r\nof her throne. _Maritime dominion_ will follow in her train; and on\r\nthe first war, all exportation of the products of our manufacturers\r\nbeing at an end, unexampled misery will involve four-fifths of our\r\npopulation, and an explosion will ensue, from its origin and character\r\nof unparalleled fury, which will sweep to destruction the insane\r\nauthors of the calamity—tear to shreds the whole fabric of society—and\r\ngive to the winds all the institutions which man has been accustomed to\r\nrevere. {135}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is disgraceful that our MARINE is not directly represented in the\r\nBritish Parliament. Is it possible that every clown in England, who is\r\nowner of a few acres or miserable hovel, is carried to the poll,—and\r\nthat our shipping interest, and brave seamen, to whom the rest of the\r\nnation is indebted “for all they have, and almost all they know,”\r\nare passed over—have not one direct representative—have not even one\r\ndirect vote, and that their interest is totally neglected[33]? Will it\r\nbe credited that our most sage legislators, as if on purpose to ruin\r\nour marine, have laid on a tax of L. 4 per load (above 1s. 7d. per\r\nsolid foot) on oak-plank, and L. 2, 15s. per load on rough oak-timber,\r\nimported from other nations; which, as only a small part of what is\r\n(not of what would be) used, is so derived, at the same time that\r\nit raises the price of the whole[34] nearly 100 per cent., tends\r\ncomparatively little to swell the revenue,—nearly the whole of the high\r\nmonopoly price reverting to our landholders and our grateful Canadian\r\n{136} colony? As about a load (50 solid feet) of timber is required\r\nfor the construction of a ton of trading shipping, this duty, together\r\nwith the high duty on hemp, increases the cost of our vessels nearly\r\nL. 4 per register ton, independent of the higher price of building\r\nand sailing them, from other monopolies; and it is only from the very\r\nsuperior skill, honesty and industry of our seamen[35], that our\r\nshipping, since the peace, under this very great disadvantage, has been\r\nat all enabled to compete with foreign. At Shields and Newcastle a new\r\nmerchant-vessel of oak, rigged and ready for sea, uncoppered, can be\r\npurchased for L. 10 per register ton. Were the price, by the removal of\r\nmonopoly, reduced to L. 6 per ton, scarcely a foreign bottom, American\r\nexcepted, would compete with British, in the carrying trade, or would\r\nenter a British port. Can it be believed that our very liberal late\r\nminister (Mr Huskisson), and our very non-liberal member for Newark\r\n(Mr Sadler), have both made a _full_ exposè of the distresses of our\r\nshipping interest, and not once have adverted to the _cause_ of this,\r\nand of the comparative decline of our naval preponderance—_the very\r\nhigh duty on the_ {137} _material_? Does our Government perceive the\r\nrapid strides which our rival brothers in America are making to surpass\r\nus in marine—and will it be so besotted as continue laws to the speedy\r\nfulfilment of this?\r\n\r\nMay we hope that, through the energy of OUR SAILOR KING, Britain will\r\nlead the van in the disenfranchisement of man from the old bondage of\r\nmonopoly and restriction—that a more sane system of taxation (a tax on\r\nproperty) will be adopted, as well as a necessary retrenchment—that the\r\ntrue interest of Britain will be understood and followed, and a new era\r\nbegin. We are sick of the drivelling nonsense of our closet economists\r\nabout loss by colonies and foreign connexion. Bonaparte well knew the\r\nvalue of SHIPS, COLONIES and COMMERCE, and dreaded the power which\r\neventually wrought his fall. The existence of China depends upon her\r\nAgriculture, and the sovereign devotes a part of his time annually to\r\nthe plough. The existence of Britain depends upon her Marine, and the\r\nking should always be bred a sailor—the heir-apparent and presumptive\r\nbeing always sent to sea. In the case of a female, if she did not take\r\nkindly to the sea-service, a dispensation might be allowed, on her\r\nmarrying a sailor, and the foolish law prohibiting our Royal Family\r\nfrom marrying a Briton be put aside.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDNOTES TO PART III.\r\n\r\n[25] If the heat and evaporation of a gardener’s pocket for several\r\ndays be sufficient to render the seeds of melons and gourds productive\r\nof plants of earlier maturity, that is less disposed to extension and\r\nmore to reproduction,—what may be expected from kiln-drying fir-cones?\r\n\r\n[26] The full ripening of the seeds of some cultivated varieties\r\nof vegetables, and also the drying of the seeds severely without\r\nartificial heat, are found to have considerable influence upon the\r\ngermination of the seeds, and even some impression upon the character\r\nof the resulting plant.\r\n\r\n[27] Covered drains are not adapted for woods, as the matted fibres of\r\nthe roots, especially of the semi-aquatic trees, very soon enter them\r\nand form obstructions.\r\n\r\n[28] Laburnum (Cytisus) is the most valuable timber this country\r\nproduces. It is equally deep in colour, and takes as fine a polish as\r\nrose-wood, having also something slightly pellucid in the polished\r\nsurface. From its extreme hardness, it is much better adapted for\r\nuse than mahogany, not being indented or injured by blows or rough\r\ntreatment. We are acquainted with no other timber of home produce so\r\nlittle liable to decay. The large-leaved variety in rich warm soils\r\nacquires a diameter of a foot or a foot and a-half, and grows rapidly\r\ntill it fall into seed-bearing. Its usual very stunted growth is partly\r\nowing to less valuable faster growing trees overtopping it: Were it\r\nplanted alone, and trained to proper curve, it might be profitably\r\nreared for the upper timbers (the part where decay commences) of small\r\nvessels: it has the thinnest covering of sap wood of any of our timber\r\ntrees. The extreme beauty and richness of its clustered depending\r\nblossoms is a considerable injury to its growth, as it is often broken\r\nand despoiled of the branches on this account. The small-leaved\r\nLaburnum, though producing the most beautiful timber, is of such\r\npuny growth as not to rank as a forest tree. There is a peculiarity,\r\nat least seldom occurring in other trees, attending the growth of\r\nthe small-leaved variety: a branch frequently gives up feeding the\r\nconnected trunk and roots, drawing supply of nourishment from these\r\nupward, without returning much or any of the digested matter downward.\r\nThis branch above the place of the stagnation of the bark vessels\r\nbecomes enlarged, running into numerous shoots, which are generally\r\nunnaturally thick and unhealthy, approaching to dropsical—often,\r\nhowever, beautifully pendant down to the ground, from their weight\r\nand the smallness of the supporting branch. We do not know whether\r\nthis is an awkward effort towards increase—that these branches, under\r\nthe influence of a not entirely matured instinct or faculty, droop in\r\nsearch of earth to root, and extend by layers, in conformity to a habit\r\nof some tribes of trees, in which this mode of increase is efficient,\r\nor that it is a disease unconnected with design or final cause. These\r\novergrown branches of the small-leaved laburnum are generally thrown\r\nout by trees, which, owing to circumstances, are little disposed to\r\nseeding.\r\n\r\n[29] Let us compare the wealth of the British landholder with that\r\nof the like grade on the Continent. It is the unrivalled skill and\r\nindustry of our manufacturers and traders which have laid every shore\r\nunder contribution for the immense riches which has poured in upon our\r\nlandholders, and which, from juxtaposition, will continue to do so,\r\nin a certain degree, under the fullest freedom of trade. It is now\r\nabsurd to talk of duties on foreign products, to counterbalance home\r\ntaxation—taxation now bears lightly on home agricultural production,\r\nmore so than in many parts of the Continent, and our manufacturers,\r\nunder the same or greater taxation, compete with and outstrip all the\r\nworld in cheapness of production.\r\n\r\n[30] The dread of change in Catholic countries—the proscription of\r\nalmost every new work treating of science—the complete submission of\r\nthe mind to the religious authorities, bearded men “becoming little\r\nchildren” even to the letter—the consequent general abandonment to\r\nsensual enjoyment—the immense number of holidays—and the shoals of\r\nmeddling priests, are a great bar to improvement—an insurmountable\r\none to manufacturing pre-eminence. We need not say that all this is\r\nsubordinate to climate. Effect, however, soon turns to cause.\r\n\r\n[31] Our industrious operatives, rendered trebly more productive by\r\nrecent machinery improvements, fabricate three times more commodity\r\nthan our landed and other population can with their present habits\r\nconsume. Few other nations can give else but food in exchange for this\r\noverplus; our landholders have enacted laws to exclude food, and our\r\noperatives are being starved down to the requisite number for home\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n[32] The same polity under which Britain has acquired supremacy, will\r\nnot now serve to continue it. A knowledge of the interests of nations\r\nis abroad, and if we will not suffer our country to be the emporium of\r\nthe world, another will.\r\n\r\n[33] See App. E.\r\n\r\n[34] The price of any article raised at home, when any part requires to\r\nbe imported, of course rises to the whole cost (prime cost, duty and\r\nfreight) of the foreign.\r\n\r\n[35] The chance of loss by wreck, damage from sea-water, and pilfering,\r\nbeing much less in British than in foreign bottoms, enables the British\r\nto obtain a higher freight than the foreign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{138} PART IV.\r\n\r\nNOTICES OF AUTHORS RELATIVE TO TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter throwing together several of our own observations, we bethought\r\nourselves of examining into the ideas and experience of recent writers\r\non the same subject. Having taken notes of the more prominent matter\r\ncontained in their pages, we believe we shall do the public a service\r\nby printing these notes, accompanied by slight remarks. This may be the\r\nmore useful, especially as almost every author has his own particular\r\nmania, which few common readers have sufficient knowledge of the\r\nsubject to discriminate from the saner matter: and as, from the nature\r\nof hobbies—from some shrewd enough guesses by the owner that they are\r\nhis own undoubted property—and, perhaps, from some misgivings, that\r\nwhat he advances on these is not perfectly self-evident, he is thence\r\nthe more disposed to expatiate upon them, and embellish. The {139}\r\ncredulous and inexperienced, partly from this, and partly from the\r\nfascination of the very improbability, rush at once into the snare;\r\nbring the speculations or assertions to practical test; get quickly\r\ndisenchanted by realities, and ever after are disposed to treat all\r\nwritten directions on material science with contempt. We bring forward\r\nthese authors in the order of perusal. We have found several remarks\r\nsimilar to our own; this was to be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n{140} I. THE FORESTER’S GUIDE, _by Mr Monteath_.\r\n\r\nThis volume is the work of a man of some experience, and of\r\nconsiderable observation and ingenuity, not much assisted by botanical\r\nor physiological science or literary attainment, which he, indeed,\r\ndisclaims. His principal forte, and what he seems to have been most\r\nengaged with, is oak-coppice—his besetting sin, cutting and cropping.\r\nHis directions on rearing and cutting coppice may be sensible;—those\r\nwho wish to practise the sacrilege of destroying young oak-forest, we\r\nrefer to him, as we have always had a horror at seeing a beautiful\r\nsapling untimeously cut down, like an American bullock for its hide. At\r\npresent, and while peace continues, it is very easy to obtain plenty\r\nof foreign bark, and also oak-timber, for consumption, at a very cheap\r\nrate, for this reason—_and also, because, in the event of war, the\r\nprice of these articles would be nearly doubled—we would request the\r\nholders of coppice, and, indeed, of all growing oak-timber, to pause\r\nin their operations of cutting, and not to sacrifice their property\r\nso unprofitably, to their own ultimate disadvantage, and also to the\r\ndetriment of {141} the national resources; but immediately to\r\nset about converting their coppice-hags into oak-forest, by careful\r\nthinning and selection_. For performing this, we refer them to Mr\r\nMonteath in person, who seems to comprehend the utility, and to be\r\npretty well versed in the practice, of thinning; only we would desire\r\nhim, in pruning, to attend to the functions of the leaves; that the\r\nmore abundant the covering of healthy foliage, the tree will progress\r\nthe faster; and that the repeated cutting down of a young plant, year\r\nafter year, as he recommends, even sometimes extending it to five\r\nyears in succession, will either destroy the plant altogether, or be\r\nextremely injurious to its growth: although, if the plant be stunted,\r\ncutting it down, once, as every body knows, is the plan which should be\r\nadopted with all kinds of our common forest trees—the coniferæ, beech,\r\nand birch, excepted.\r\n\r\nMr Monteath advises a naturalization of young plants, after they are\r\ngot from nurseries, in a soil and climate similar to that which they\r\nare ultimately to occupy. We see no necessity for this. All that is\r\nrequired in a young plant, is, that it be of good variety, of firm\r\nfibre, in a healthy growing state; with a stout stem, in proportion to\r\nthe height, {142} with numerous side branches, and with a root rather\r\nlarge in comparison to the part above ground.\r\n\r\nOur author’s mode of preparation of turfy peat-moss soils for planting\r\nwe think good, but conveniently applicable in heathy moss ground, only\r\nwith the assistance of the late Mr Finlayson’s ingenious device of\r\nthe self-clearing plough. At every seven feet of breadth, Mr Monteath\r\nexcavates a deep rut, by means of a plough with three coulters and\r\ntwo mould-boards,—two of the coulters cutting, each, a side of the\r\nrut, the other dividing it in the middle, and the double mould-board\r\nturning out a furrow to each side. He passes this plough twice along\r\nin forming the rut, each time turning out from four to six inches in\r\ndepth, so that the whole depth of the rut is about ten inches. These\r\nminor drains communicate with larger ones dug by the spade across the\r\nfield. The thrown up slices are then cut into lengths of eighteen\r\ninches, and carefully dried, by turning and by piling a few together,\r\nas openly as possible, that the wind may blow through. A small pile,\r\nabout six in number, is then burnt upon the intended site of each tree,\r\nif necessary, aided in the combustion by furze or other fuel; taking\r\ncare, by proper regulation of the quantity of fuel, or otherwise, to\r\nprevent the combustion from proceeding too {143} far, and the ashes\r\nfrom becoming white and light, as in this case a considerable part\r\nof their virtues is dissipated. This ploughing, drying, and burning,\r\nbeing performed as early in the summer as the weather will permit,\r\nthe earth under the ashes is immediately dug over, from two to four\r\nfeet in breadth, and mixed with the ashes, and the following spring\r\nthe planting is performed. In situations where Mr Monteath’s plough\r\ncould not be worked to advantage, these minor drains may be formed by\r\nthe spade; and in heathy peat soils, not requiring drains, the burning\r\nof the heathy turfs on the site of the plants might be efficacious in\r\ncorrecting the tannin, and in reducing and enriching the soil within\r\nthe immediate reach of the young plant, which would thus acquire\r\nstrength to subdue the more distant part, and gradually reduce and form\r\nthe whole into soil capable of affording healthy nourishment.\r\n\r\nWe also approve of the plan mentioned by Mr Monteath, for covering\r\nwith timber, rocks or stony ground, so bare of soil as not to admit of\r\nplanting, by means of placing seeds in the crevices, or on the shelves\r\nof the rock, and scraping together a little mould to cover them; or,\r\nwhen practicable, placing the seeds in the middle of the mould. Here,\r\nhowever, we think he errs, in recommending the {144} cutting down\r\nof the young resulting shoot, year after year, that the plant may\r\nacquire long roots, extended down the crevices, to give the future\r\nstem stability and sufficient foraging. We would never cut down but\r\nwhen the plant appeared stunted, and not then in succession, nearer\r\nthan three or four years from the last cutting. Those who possess\r\nrocky precipices, so steep or inaccessible that the above method\r\nof our author could not be practised with conveniency, may cause a\r\nquantity of the cheapest seeds of trees be sown down over the top of\r\nthe crags during the winter: we would prefer the end of January, as the\r\nmouldering effects of the frost and the rains would cover numbers of\r\nthese, so as they would come to vegetate.\r\n\r\nMr Monteath advises, in rearing oak-forest or copse, to put in only\r\nabout thirty plants per acre, and by layers from these to cover the\r\ninterstices. In order to recommend this practice, he states the\r\ncelerity with which these could be extended, layer beyond layer, making\r\nsteps, every second season, of eight or nine feet, by relaying the\r\nlast layer’s shoots, and he affirms, that a forest could be sooner,\r\nand more economically raised by this means, than by planting the whole\r\nat first. This is sufficiently imaginative. He seems not to be aware\r\nof the fact, that life is {145} very languid, and growth slow, in any\r\nbranch horizontally extended, especially when upright stems from the\r\nsame root are suffered to remain. He also expects the layer-roots to\r\nbecome strong and capable to forage for large trees. That they will,\r\nin the oak, ever become so, we think very improbable. Examination\r\nof the roots which proceed from oak-layers would place this beyond\r\ndispute; if they are, as we presume, fibrous and slender, similar to\r\nthose produced by apple-layers, no tree or bush of any great size will\r\nresult. Large trees, generally, cannot be procured by layers, but only\r\nin those semiaquatic kinds which grow readily by slips. Whether it\r\nmay be advantageous to fill up the vacancies of copse by layers, in\r\npreference to seed-plants, experience only can determine. The bark of\r\ntrees or bushes raised by layers or cuttings is generally thicker than\r\nthat of those raised from seed:—this might balance some deficiency of\r\nthe growth in the case of oak-coppice.\r\n\r\nOur author advises the cutting off the upper part of spruce-trees on\r\nthe outside of plantations, in order that their lower branches may\r\nextend the more, and remain vigorous,—thence affording more adequate\r\nshelter to the within plantation. Perhaps it is quite unnecessary to\r\nguard any person from practising this piece of folly. On the outside\r\nof woods, spruce-firs {146} will retain the branches in vigour,\r\nsufficiently low for all the purposes of shelter: nothing could be more\r\nunseemly than the decapitated trees; and in a few years most of them\r\nwould become rotted in the stem, die, and fall down.\r\n\r\nFrom observing, on the western side of Scotland, thriving plantations\r\nexposed to south-west winds and sea-spray, and also to north-east\r\nwinds and sea-spray, in woods extending along the western side of\r\nthe salt lochs in Argyllshire, our author predicts, that, under his\r\npanacea of repeated cutting down, trees would grow luxuriantly in\r\nexposed situations on the north-eastern margin of our island. We do not\r\ndesire to see Mr Monteath’s sanguine hope turned to disappointment,\r\nwhich a trial would certainly effect. There is something peculiarly\r\nhard and cutting in our _vernal_ north-eastern breeze fresh from\r\nocean, which withers up the tender spreading leaves of every plant\r\nraised from the ground, and placed in its immediate draught. This is\r\noccasioned as well by a cold moist, as by a cold dry wind, the new\r\nvegetable structure in the developing process, when the tissues of\r\ntubes and cells are only in the state of pulp, and all the molecular\r\ngerms floating into figure, under the direction of vital and chemical\r\nimpulses and attractions, being very susceptible {147} of derangement.\r\nWe attribute this effect on vegetables principally to the coldness and\r\nsaline matter. The depressing effect on the spirits or vital energy of\r\nman, occasioned by the eastern breeze, does not appear to be dependent\r\non the same cause. The great rivers, the Rhine, the Weser, the Elbe,\r\nindependent of the English rivers, throw a great quantity of decaying\r\nvegetable matter into the lower part of the German sea, which, being\r\nthere only a shallow muddy gulf, may thence have its waters so far\r\ncontaminated as to throw off pernicious exhalations. Or, what is much\r\nmore probable, the eastern breeze, sweeping along the swamps (at this\r\ntime in high evaporation, of malaria) which extend from Holland upward,\r\nand along the whole southern shore of the Baltic, and thence eastward\r\nnobody knows how far, must bear these exhalations, uncorrected, over\r\nthe narrow sea which intervenes between these flats and our shores.\r\nIt is even likely that a slight diffusion of saline matter from this\r\ngulf, instead of correcting, may have the opposite effect, as a small\r\nquantity of salt tends to promote putrefaction. It is evident that this\r\nmiasma-atmosphere, borne across the German sea, is not pernicious to\r\nvegetables; as, when the breeze is not too cold, or too violent, they\r\nprogress rapidly in growth, {148} and acquire a deep green colour:\r\nand, on the north-eastern Scotch coast, where timber suffers most, the\r\nbreeze has little of that depressive influence on man, although it\r\nmay derange his respiratory and transpiratory organs; while down on\r\nthe shores of Suffolk and Essex, where the malaria of the breeze is\r\ngreatest to man, the exposed trees receive less injury. Yet something\r\nmay depend upon the electric state of this air, or upon the greater\r\npressure of the atmosphere, which, we believe, are connected. On the\r\nexposed east coast, when it is desired to grow timber, we must estimate\r\nthe most enduring kind of tree, perhaps sycamore plane, and place it to\r\nseaward, covering it as much as possible by wall, and planting other\r\nkinds under its lee. We have noticed several instances where timber\r\nthrove well, without shelter, close by the sea, on our north-east\r\ncoast, which we attributed to a diminished draught of the eastern\r\nbreeze, owing to the configuration of the adjacent higher country.\r\n\r\nMr Monteath ascribes the sickliness and decay which, in many places,\r\nis perceptible in the timber of narrow belts, to the want of shelter,\r\nand recommends to form belts wider. There is some truth in this, and\r\nthe advice is good, although he does not seem to be aware of the\r\nwhole cause of the evil. {149} Trees in single rows thrive latterly\r\nmuch better than in narrow belts, because, from the planting, they\r\nare habituated to open situation, and acquire roots, branches, and\r\nstem, suited to this: whereas trees in narrow belts, from being in a\r\nthicket while young, acquire great length of stem, and roots and tops\r\nunproportionably small; and, when thinned out, and from the narrowness\r\nof the belt, exposed nearly as much, as, though in single row, they\r\nbecome sickly, from delicacy of constitution unsuited to this exposure,\r\nand from deficiency of roots to draw moisture commensurate to the\r\nincreased evaporation. To obviate this evil, resulting from narrow\r\nbelts, timely thinning, so as to retain numerous side-branches downward\r\nto the ground, of course, should be adopted. In a drier climate, or in\r\nhigh and exposed situation, continued forest will have great effect in\r\npromoting the luxuriance and health of timber; but in the southern part\r\nof Scotland, there are few situations, keeping away from high elevation\r\nand the eastern coast, where any of our common trees would prosper in\r\nforest, which would not grow pretty well singly, provided the plant be\r\nallowed from the first to accommodate its figure to the situation.\r\n\r\nMr Monteath’s system of pruning severely while {150} the trees are\r\nyoung, we think very prejudicial; and his restricting pruning to trees\r\nunder 15 or 20 feet in height, equally erroneous. About 15 years ago,\r\nwe selected a number of young trees several years planted, and low\r\nand bushy, in an open situation. We treated one half of these in a\r\nmanner similar to what our author inculcates, pruning away most of\r\nthe lower branches, and also any irregular top ones: and the other\r\nportion, though very bushy, we left to nature’s own discretion, merely\r\ncorrecting several which threw up more than one leader. The result\r\nhas been, that those much pruned up have required constant attention\r\nto the top and repeated pruning, they continuing to break forth into\r\nirregular branches and numerous leaders, and thence have sustained\r\nconsiderable loss of growth; while those let alone, after hanging\r\nseveral years in bush fashion, of their own accord have thrown up fine\r\nleaders, which now form beautiful, upright stems, with sufficiency of\r\nregular lateral branches or feeders, requiring little or no attention;\r\nwhile the original bush at the ground, from the size and overshadowing\r\nof the superior tree, appears now so diminutive as to be unworthy of\r\nnotice. We do not mean to inculcate that pruning is superfluous; on the\r\ncontrary, when judiciously executed, under regulation of the purpose\r\nfor which the {151} particular kind of timber may be required, it is\r\nhighly useful: but the cutting off and diminishing the number of lower\r\nfeeders, thence deterring the growth of the tree, and encouraging the\r\nsuperior feeders to push up as leaders; or to increase in size so as to\r\nrender their removal, should it be necessary, dangerous to the health\r\nof the tree, and the upper part of the stem useless from large knots\r\n(a practice which in nine cases out of ten is followed), cannot be\r\nsufficiently reprobated. _In pruning, every means should be taken to\r\nincrease the number of feeders_, in order that none of them may become\r\ntoo large; and no healthy regular feeder should be lopped off till the\r\ntree has reached the required height of stem, and a sufficient top\r\nabove this for the purpose of growth; at which time the feeders upon\r\nthe stem, as far up as this necessary height, may be removed[36].\r\n\r\nMr Monteath states that Scots fir should not be thinned to greater\r\ndistance than 20 feet apart, and larch 15 feet. This shews very little\r\nconsideration: the distance apart necessary for these kinds of timber,\r\nand of all other kinds, must be relative to the soil, situation and\r\nclimate, and the intentions of the owner, whether he means to bring\r\nthem soon to {152} market, or carry them forward to great timber.\r\nWhen fir trees are intended to be early cut down, or when disease in\r\nlarch from unfitness of soil may be apprehended, as it is thence of\r\nsmall consequence though their future ability to become great timber\r\nbe destroyed by closeness, the plants should be retained pretty near\r\neach other from the first, that the timber may be tall, straight, and\r\nclean. On the other hand, when the soil is suitable and great timber\r\nintended, early attention to thinning and great openness from the\r\nfirst is absolutely necessary, as they (the firs), different from\r\nother trees, can never repair the loss of their lower branches by\r\nthrowing out new ones from the naked stem; and double the distance\r\nstated by Mr Monteath at least for larch, which, instead of less, needs\r\nmore space than Scots fir, will be required. We believe the decay of\r\nScots fir, occurring so generally at about 40 years of age, although\r\nalso dependent on inferior variety and kiln-drying of cones, arises\r\nprincipally from want of timely thinning; that is, that the infirm\r\nvariety of Scots fir in common use, when supported by numerous feeders,\r\nand not weakened by being drawn up into a tall slender stem, will often\r\nhave hardihood to continue growing, and acquire considerable size in\r\nour cold, wet, moorish tills, or even in our moorish {153} sandy\r\nflats. Many casualties will, however, occur among resinous trees[37],\r\nespecially in unsuitable soil, even when the plants rise from the seed\r\nnaturally sown, and have sufficient room for lateral expansion. The\r\nsame cause, viz. closeness or want of thinning, induces early maturity,\r\nold age and decay in larch, although it does not seem to have any\r\ninfluence, either as inducement to, or prevention of, the rot. We have\r\nheard men,—even men reasonable on other subjects—speak of allowing a\r\npine wood to thin itself: as well might a farmer speak of allowing his\r\nturnip field to thin itself. When woods are planted of various kinds\r\nof timber, the stronger, larger growing kinds will sometimes acquire\r\nroom by overwhelming the smaller: but when the forest is of one kind\r\nof tree, and too close, all suffer nearly alike, and follow each other\r\nfast in decay, as their various strength of constitution gives way;\r\nunless, from some negligence or defect in planting, a portion of the\r\nplants have come away quickly, and the others hung back sickly for\r\nseveral years, so that {154} the former might master the latter:\r\nor when some strong growing variety overtops its congeners. In the\r\nnatural forest of America, when a clearance by any means is effected,\r\nthe young seedlings, generally all of one kind, spring up so numerous,\r\nthat, choaking each other, they all die together in a few years. This\r\nclose springing up and dying is sometimes repeated several times over;\r\ndifferent kinds of trees rising in succession, till the seeds in the\r\nsoil be so reduced as to throw up plants so far asunder as to afford\r\nbetter opportunity for the larger growing varieties to develope their\r\nstrength; and, overpowering the less, thus acquire spread of branches\r\ncommensurate to the height, and thence strength of constitution\r\nsufficient to bear them forward to large trees.\r\n\r\nMr Monteath, apparently to encourage the destruction of young oak, and\r\nkeep his merciless hatchet agoing, asserts that “oak trees, at the age\r\nof 24 or not exceeding 30 years, have as thick a rind or fleshy part\r\nof bark, as when they arrive at 50.” If by this he means to say, that\r\nthe useful part of the oak bark of the stem of a tree at 50 years old\r\nis no thicker than that of one of 30, we say he is wrong, widely wrong.\r\nA thriving oak tree of 100 years will still continue to increase the\r\nthickness of the valuable part of the bark on the stem, although part\r\nof the {155} outer layers or cuticle may lose vitality, and become\r\n_corky_. We have taken down a luxuriant growing oak, exceeding three\r\nfeet in diameter, the living bark of whose stem was about two inches\r\nin thickness, resembling thick plank, and which was considered by the\r\ntanners much stronger in quality than bark of younger growth. Has Mr\r\nMonteath seen any bark resembling this on 24 years old sproutings? If,\r\nby the above quotation, our author means to say, that the valuable\r\npart of the bark on the branches of a tree 30 years old, is equal in\r\nthickness to that on the same sized branches of a tree at 50, we say he\r\nerrs still; that is, provided the older tree be in a healthy thriving\r\ncondition, and growing equally open and exposed as the younger. Trees,\r\nas they increase in years, increase also in the thickness of the living\r\nbark, from the root upwards to the smallest twig, provided they have\r\nnot begun to get dry and sickly from over maturity. When this period\r\narrives, the living part of the bark upon the stem and larger branches\r\nbecomes very thin, with a great proportion of dead corky substance;\r\nalthough, on the twigs and smaller branches, it still continues to\r\nthicken. The age at which the external part of the bark begins to lose\r\nvitality, is considerably dependant upon luxuriance of growth, climate,\r\nand exposure; and the {156} period when this loss proceeds faster than\r\nthe annual increase within, is altogether dependent on the vigour of\r\nthe tree, not on the age, and never takes place till the timber is ripe\r\nfor the dock-yard.\r\n\r\nWe would warn the readers of Mr Monteath’s volume, that his\r\ncalculations and statements regarding the worth of coppice and timber\r\ngenerally, seem more suited to flatter the owner’s wishes than to be\r\nuseful to him as a merchant; or to be adjusted to the value of money\r\nduring the late war—not to the present value. We also do not very well\r\ncomprehend his re-establishment or resuscitation of life in dead trees.\r\nWe observe several other slight errors, such as the duration of his\r\npaling,—and the affirmation that the sap-wood will not extend so as to\r\ncover over the section of a pruned branch which contains any red or\r\nmatured wood. Most readers will be able to detect such errors as these.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of Mr Monteath’s volume, we would offer our\r\nacknowledgment for the attention he has bestowed on the subject of the\r\nseasoning of timber, by steaming with extract of wood (pyroligneous\r\nacid) and by scorching, as prevention of dry rot. The greatest\r\nobjection we see to his plan is, that all timber dried quickly is\r\nliable to crack and split, and loses a considerable portion of its\r\n{157} toughness and elasticity; at least, timber when dried slowly is\r\nharder and stronger than when dried quickly, the dryness in both cases\r\nbeing carried to the same extent. The comparative strength of timber\r\nscorched and timber not scorched, after both are soaked in water, as\r\nin the lower timbers and plank of vessels, should be subjected to\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nOur author’s directions (although the practice is also not new) to\r\nseason larch by peeling off the bark one or more years previous to\r\ncutting, in order to prevent it from warping or twisting in framed\r\nhousework; and his hints recommending stripping off the bark from\r\nmost kinds of timber a season previous to cutting, are also deserving\r\nof notice. We greatly wonder that something efficacious has not been\r\ndone in regard to dry rot by our Navy Board, and consider the subject\r\nof such importance, that we think a rot-prevention officer or wood\r\nphysician should be appointed to each war vessel from the time her\r\nfirst timber is laid down, to be made in some shape accountable if\r\nrot to any extent should ever occur; and that this officer should be\r\nregularly bred to his profession at an institution established for the\r\nstudy of this branch of science at the King’s largest building yard.\r\nPerhaps it might be as well to endow several professors’ chairs at the\r\nuniversities to follow {158} out and lecture on this science, as being\r\nof far more importance than many which are already endowed. We think\r\nthat steeping in fresh water pits for several years, till a kind of\r\nacetous fermentation take place in the timber, or till it become of a\r\nblue colour; or in tan-pits; or for a shorter period in strong brine\r\npits; or even salting the timber like herrings, after it is blocked\r\nout; or forcing pyroligneous acid, or composition of chlorine, or\r\nother solution, antiseptic or obnoxious to life, into the pores of the\r\ntimber when dry, by pressure; or perhaps by charring the timbers after\r\nthey are cleaned down on the stocks ready for the plank, by playing on\r\nthem a jet of flame from a flexible gas pipe,—might, some of them, be\r\nfound preventive of the rot, and at same time not to impair any of the\r\nvaluable qualities of the timber.\r\n\r\nWe are a little shy in committing ourselves, lest we should be\r\nimpressed as a dry-rot physician or professor; but if the following\r\nplan for preservation of vessels when unemployed has not already been\r\ntried, we recommend it to the notice of our Navy Board.\r\n\r\nLet every part of the vessel be cleared out, and every port-hole or\r\nexternal opening be made as air-tight as possible.\r\n\r\nLet a quantity of recent-burned limestone {159} (lime-shells) be\r\nspread thin over every inside deck or floor, and over the whole bottom\r\nand sides of the vessel, and every door or hatch in the main-deck be\r\nimmediately closed down air-tight. A number of rods or shreds of timber\r\nwould require to be nailed slightly to the inside skin of the ship\r\nwhere the slope is considerable, in order that the lime-shells may rest\r\nand not roll down.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is found that the lime-shells are completely\r\nslaked—become hydrate of lime—let it be sold to the farmer or\r\nhouse-builder, or be used in any government erection going forward at\r\nthe time; and let another quantity be laid in. We would consider a\r\nsloop of 80 tons load of lime, value, prime cost and freight, about\r\nL.70, would suffice for covering the internal surface of a seventy-four\r\ngun ship. When slaked to powder, the lime might be disposed of at\r\nlittle loss. It is impossible, without trial, to say how often the\r\nlime would require renewal, but we think twice or thrice a-year would\r\nsuffice to preserve the vessel dry and free of any corruption; perhaps\r\neven once might be found effectual. Suppose that the lime was renewed\r\nevery four months, and that when slaked it only sold at two-thirds of\r\nthe whole cost, the preservation of a line-of-battle ship would be\r\nnearly as follows. The price of the lime {160} and work is correct,\r\naccording to the rates in most of the harbours of Scotland.\r\n\r\n A quantity of rods or shreds of timber, about three inches\r\n   in diameter, for nailing on the sloping sides of the vessel,\r\n   material and labour,                            L.20  0  0\r\n\r\n Eighty tons lime-shells = 560 bolls, at 1s. 7d.\r\n   per boll, prime cost,                             44  6  8\r\n\r\n Freight of 560 bolls, at 1s.                        28  0  0\r\n   The slaked lime is supposed to sell at 2-3ds\r\n     of the cost, thence the whole loss on a year\r\n     would equal the value of one cargo.\r\n\r\n Carrying three lime cargoes of shells aboard,\r\n   and spreading them,                               30  0  0\r\n   We allow here for the greater distance of\r\n     carriage, and spreading out of the cargo,\r\n     nearly thrice the sum requisite to remove\r\n     lime-shells from a vessel into a cart.\r\n\r\n Removing the slaked lime of three cargoes,          30  0  0\r\n                                                  ―――――――――――\r\n                      Cost first year,            L.152  6  8\r\n                      Deduct rods,                   20  0  0\r\n                                                  ―――――――――――\r\n Cost, second, and each following year,           L.132  6  8\r\n\r\nThe complete efficacy of lime-shells in preventing dry-rot is already\r\nproved—the coasting small craft frequently employed in the carriage\r\nof lime-shells not being liable to it. All that requires to be\r\nascertained, is the minimum quantity which will effect it; and if\r\nthe expense of this quantity will greatly exceed the average loss by\r\ndry-rot in our unemployed {161} shipping. If the quantity necessary be\r\nnot greater than what we have supposed—even Mr Hume himself would not\r\nconsider the expense extravagant—the preservation of a line-of-battle\r\nship not exceeding that of one of our numerous army _captains_ while\r\nlying _in ordinary_.\r\n\r\nLime is preventive of dry-rot in several ways,—when uncombined as an\r\nantiseptic, simply by drying, from its attraction for water; by its\r\ncausticity, which remains for a number of months after it is slaked,\r\ndestroying organic life; and by its absorbing putrescent gases. It is\r\nnot easy, without trial, to form a correct estimate of the quantity of\r\nmoisture which would enter through the inside planking of a man-of-war;\r\nbut were the bottom of the vessel in good condition, the pumps attended\r\nto, and external air excluded, we should consider that the moisture\r\nwould not greatly exceed 60 tons of water yearly, which would nearly\r\nbe required to convert 240 tons of lime-shells into dry hydrate of\r\nlime. No very great injury or inconvenience would be produced by the\r\nopening of the seams of the ceiling (the inside skin), or of the inner\r\ndecks or floors, or by the warping of the plank, resulting from the\r\ncontraction of the timber by the dryness; but the caulking of the main\r\ndeck would require to be looked to. {162} No danger from fire need be\r\napprehended, from the sudden slaking of a thin layer of shells, even\r\nthough a leak in the main deck should occur. The thickness beyond which\r\nshells could not be suddenly slaked upon dry boards without danger of\r\nfire, might be tried.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to mention, that, though lime-shells, or dry hydrate of\r\nlime, when timber is so dry as to be liable to corruption by insects\r\nor by dry rot, is, by destroying life and increasing the dryness,\r\npreventive of this corruption; yet lime, in contact with timber for\r\na considerable time in very moist air, from its great attraction to\r\nwater, draws so much moisture from the air as to become wet mortar or\r\npulp, which, moistening the timber, promotes its decay by the moist\r\nrot.\r\n\r\n\r\n{163} II.—NICOL’S PLANTER’S CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nThis volume, which ought to have been named Sang’s Nurseryman’s\r\nCalendar, is a work of very considerable merit and usefulness, where\r\nthe craft of the common nurseryman is plainly and judiciously taught.\r\nThe editor, Mr Sang, admits that he was very little indebted to the\r\nnotes of his friend (the late Mr Nicol) for the matter of the volume;\r\nand the work itself bears evidence of this, being principally devoted\r\nto the operations of the nursery, the sowing and planting of hard-wood\r\ntrees, which are described with a judgment and accuracy attainable\r\nonly by long experience in that line, to which we understand Mr Sang\r\nbelongs. Every person engaged with the sowing, planting, or rearing of\r\ntimber, if he be not too wise or too old to learn, should forthwith\r\nprocure this volume.\r\n\r\nMr Sang recommends sowing of forests in preference to planting, which\r\nmany before him have done, we believe, more from conjecture that\r\nnature’s own process must be superior to any method of art, than from\r\nany experience of the fact or accurate {164} knowledge of—at least\r\nwithout giving sufficient explanation of, any cause rendering the\r\ntree of more puny growth in consequence of being transplanted. In\r\nthe case of simple herbaceous vegetables, we find, on the contrary,\r\nthat transplanting increases the size, protracts the period of full\r\ndevelopment, and retards the decay, the individual suffering no lasting\r\ninjury from root fracture, or that injury being more than compensated\r\nby change to a new and more recently wrought soil; or even the root\r\nfracture, instead of being of prejudice to the growth, by throwing the\r\nenergy of the plant in this direction to repair the injury, not only\r\nmay do so, but delaying the superior process towards reproduction[38],\r\nmay also give a {165} new vigour to the soft fibrous rootlets,\r\nand greater extension than they otherwise would have attained.\r\nBut in regard to some kinds of compound plants of perennial stem,\r\ntransplanting, especially when the plant has attained some size, by\r\nfracture, throws the main wide diverging roots into numerous rootlets\r\nand slender matted fibres, none of which has individual strength to\r\nextend as a leader far beyond the shade of the spreading top, thence\r\nforage in a drier, more exhausted soil, and, from consequent want of\r\nsupply of moisture, the sap of the tree stagnates into flower, or\r\nmerely leaf-buds, instead of flowing out into new wood. The fibrous\r\nsofter rooting vegetables sustain no lasting injury from root-fracture\r\nand transplanting; but the harder, more woody, larger growing roots,\r\nlosing their leader, never entirely recover their original power of\r\nextention. Yet we think that one or two year old plants, taken from\r\nthe seed-bed, would suffer little or no injury from removal, as the\r\n_tap-root_, which is ultimately of no consequence, never constituting\r\na leader, but eventually {166} disappearing, is the only part which\r\nsuffers fracture in the woody state; and the side shoots, which become\r\nthe grand root leaders, are in the fibrous state, which easily repairs\r\nsmall injury. These observations refer only to certain kinds of timber\r\ntrees. The willows, poplars, and lindens, succeed better when their\r\nroots are cropped in near the bulb when removed. We planted a piece of\r\ntrenched ground, partly with poplar plants, with good roots, from a\r\nnursery, and partly with poplar loppings, about the same size as the\r\nplants, stuck into the ground: the loppings grew more luxuriantly than\r\nthe nursery plants. The same occurs with willows—with this difference,\r\nthat willow-loppings do better with the top entirely cropped, without\r\nany twigs or external buds; the poplar only pruned a little, with\r\na terminal bud left on every twig, especially on the top shoot.\r\nThe superiority of the growth of those without roots, results from\r\ntheir having fewer buds and twigs to exhaust the juices before the\r\nformation of new fibrils to draw from the ground, these few buds thence\r\ncontinuing to push more strongly, and from the roots growing more\r\nvigorously when sprung anew, than when they are a continuation of the\r\nwounded deranged old ones.\r\n\r\nNew rootlets spring out much sooner and more {167} boldly from the\r\nthick vigorous green stem bark, than from the delicate tender root\r\nbark, and also more vigorously from the bark of the bulb than from\r\nthe bark of the remote roots, of those soft-wooded trees; indeed, it\r\nappears to be owing alone to the great strength of the vitality of the\r\nbark of the stem, that those kinds are so capable of continuation by\r\ncuttings. The roots have nearly the same delicacy of those of other\r\nkinds of trees, and show no particular readiness to throw up sprouts\r\nwhen bared.\r\n\r\nMr Sang, in furtherance of his advocated scheme of raising forests\r\n_in situ_ from the seed, sensible of the general impracticability of\r\nfallowing or working the ground all over previous to sowing, gives\r\ndirections for pitting or stirring the earth the previous spring and\r\nsummer, in spots about fourteen inches square, and from six to nine\r\nfeet separate, burying the turf under the soil, in order that it may be\r\nrotted, and a fine friable mould obtained for reception of the seeds to\r\nbe sown the following spring; several seeds are then deposited in each\r\nspot, equidistant; these require to be hand-weeded the first season,\r\nand the resulting plants hoed around for several successive years, till\r\nthey have mastered the weeds, after which they are all plucked out but\r\none (the most promising) in each spot. This is all very well, {168} if\r\nwe could have patience and assiduity to proceed thus systematically;\r\nand if the mice, birds, and other enemies, would “let them be;” but\r\nalthough this plan, when a braird is obtained, and the tufts cleaned,\r\nand seasonably thinned, is probably the best, yet landlords, in general\r\nincapable of exertion, but under the excitement of a fresh thought, are\r\nso infirm of purpose; tenure of life and property are so precarious;\r\nand trusted servants, especially when the procedure has originated\r\nwith another, are so liable to be negligent, that our amateurs ought\r\nto gratify their passion for improvement while it lasts, and proceed\r\nat once by purchase of plants, and pitting or slitting, which procures\r\nthem a forest immediately palpable to view. There is no doubt, however,\r\nthat wooing the soil to kindliness, rearing the infant plant from the\r\ngerm, and superintending _a principio_ the entire beautiful process of\r\nvegetable development, will afford a deeper charm to a patient lover\r\nof nature; and that the continued solicitude and attentions required\r\nduring this process acting upon man’s parental instinct, will excite an\r\ninterest hardly to be felt towards a child of adoption.\r\n\r\nA nursery gives such facility to the rearing of the plants, that,\r\ntaking into account the greater chance of failure by sowing _in situ_\r\nthan by planting, the {169} latter practice will be executed for one\r\nhalf the expense of the former. Supposing that the progress, after\r\ntwenty years’ occupancy of the ground, be equal in both cases,—at\r\nwhich period, however, we think the transplanted would still have\r\nthe advantage,—it would require a considerable ultimate superior\r\nprogress in those sown, to outbalance the accumulating value of the\r\nextra expense. It is probable a combination of both practices might be\r\nadvantageously followed—sowing the soils and situations most suitable,\r\nand transplanting the thinnings of these into the more exposed\r\nunpropitious places[39]. The matter, however, must, after all, be left\r\nto the test of experiment in a variety of soils and situations.\r\n\r\nThis volume, being principally a monthly detail of a nursery practice,\r\nwhich has supported the test of competition, has, on this account, a\r\nvery different credit and value from much that has been published of\r\nlandlords’ practice, theorists’ conjectures, or adventurers’ quackery.\r\nThe burthen of our author’s song, which, from the nature of the work,\r\nfalls to be repeated at several of the calendary periods, and which\r\nperhaps cannot be too often repeated, is nearly as follows.\r\n\r\nProcure good seed of the best varieties from large healthy trees,\r\nand preserve these in husk in dry {170} well-aired places till\r\nsowing; with the exception of ash keys, haws, holly-berries, roans,\r\nand yew-berries, which require to be put in the rot-heap as soon as\r\ngathered. The rot-heap consists of seed mixed with sandy earth formed\r\ninto a layer not exceeding ten inches in thickness; this is turned\r\nseveral times before midwinter, when it is covered with a layer of\r\nearth about seven inches deep, to exclude the frost. After remaining\r\nin this heap one year—till September, or the following February, these\r\nseeds are sown out.\r\n\r\nSow seeds of trees during the last half of February, March, or April,\r\non beds of high manured easy soil, in very fine tilth, and clear of\r\nweeds, such as follows hoed green crop, in distance and depth in\r\nproportion to the size of the seed, or rather of the annual stem or\r\nbraird. To deposit the seed at an equable depth, the upper friable\r\nmould is pushed (cuffed) off the bed to the interstices between by\r\nthe reversed head of a rake, as deep as necessary; the seed is then\r\ndeposited by the hand, and rolled over by a very light roller to fix\r\nit, that it may not suffer derangement by the return of the earth which\r\nis then evenly _cuffed_ back from the sides, and no harrowing or raking\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nWatch most narrowly, and ward off or destroy all {171} kinds of\r\nvermin, mice, snails, birds, till the time when the rising braird has\r\ndisencumbered itself of the husk of the seed thrown up by the ascending\r\nstem, and nip out every weed as soon as discernible by the naked eye.\r\nIn order to diminish the toil of watching, the different kinds should\r\nbe sown as near the same time as their nature renders prudent, and the\r\nseed-beds be situated as near each other as circumstances will admit.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first or second season, according to size and\r\ncloseness of plants, remove the seedlings from the bed to nursery rows,\r\nat any time when the leaf is off, and the ground sufficiently dry\r\nnot to poach; before April for deciduous trees, and during April for\r\nevergreens, placing them in rather open order, either by dibbling or\r\nlaying, according to the nature of the root, firming the plants well in\r\nthe ground; in case of dibbling, taking good heed to leave no vacuum of\r\nhole under the root, and to work the tool so as to compress the earth\r\nmore below than above.\r\n\r\nKeep the soil loose and friable on the surface, and clear of weeds\r\nbetween the transplanted rows by repeated seasonable hoeings, and let\r\nthe plants rise with a single leader.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants have stood one or two years in {172} the nursery-row,\r\nremove them to their ultimate destination with as little fracture or\r\nexposure of root as possible,—the larger rooted by pitting, and the\r\nsmaller by slitting, or as the nature of the soil may require; paying\r\nmost particular attention to plant the dry ground early after the leaf\r\nhas dropped, and the moister and more adhesive soils in succession, as\r\nthey become so dry in spring as not to adhere to the tools in working,\r\nor poach in treading the plant firm in; removing the evergreens\r\nearlier, or later, in April, according to the dryness or moistness of\r\nthe ground; dipping the roots in a clay-puddle, and endeavouring to\r\nseize the opportunity of planting before a shower, should the spring be\r\nfar advanced and dry, especially in the more arid situations.\r\n\r\nStout healthy seedlings, one or two years old, may be at once removed\r\nfrom the seed-bed to their place in the forest, and will often succeed\r\nas well as when nursed in rows, as above.———We have preferred the\r\npick of the seedlings to the common run of the transplanted, as being\r\nprobably stronger growing varieties.\r\n\r\nIn cases where it is practicable, work over the new plantations for\r\nseveral years with crops of potatoes, turnips, lettuce, &c., manuring\r\nthe ground, if {173} possible; and then sow out with perennial\r\nrye-grass and white clover, if the trees are not become a close cover,\r\nmaking economical use of the grass as early in the season as it can be\r\nmowed with a short scythe.\r\n\r\nFor seeds that require to lie a season in the rot-heap, such as ash\r\nkeys, haws, &c. September-sowing is preferable to deferring it to the\r\nfollowing spring, as they are liable to chip in the heap. If not sown\r\nin September, they must be got in as soon in February as possible.\r\n\r\nAcorns, Spanish and Horse Chestnuts, are best sown when they drop from\r\nthe tree; but when the seed is not procured till spring, the sowing\r\nought not to be deferred beyond February and March. The best soil is a\r\ndeep rich loam.\r\n\r\nElm-seed may be sown in June, when it is new from the tree, or\r\ncarefully dried and kept over season till next spring; one-half may\r\nthen be sown in March, and the other in April, as the March-sown is\r\nsometimes injured by late frosts. The utmost care is required to\r\nprevent this seed from heating when newly gathered.\r\n\r\nBeech braird is also liable to be cut off by spring frost; the seed\r\nshould therefore be sown partly in March and partly in April, to\r\ndiminish the chance {174} of entire failure. The soil requires to be\r\nrich, and is benefited by a dressing of well-made manure previous to\r\nsowing.\r\n\r\nSycamore Plane braird also suffers by late frost, and for greater\r\nsecurity ought also to be sown partly in March and partly in April.\r\nPlanes require dry, poor, rather exposed sandy soil, for seed-bed; as,\r\nin rich damp soil, the top of the annual shoot does not ripen: the seed\r\nought to be thinly sown.\r\n\r\nBirch and Alder seeds require to be sown in March, or beginning of\r\nApril, on very fine, rich, easy mould, giving them very slight cover,\r\nespecially the birch.\r\n\r\nThe Coniferæ, Scots Fir, Spruce, Silver Fir, &c. should be sown in\r\nApril, on very rich easy soil. The greatest care is required to deposit\r\nthese different seeds at proper regular depth, from an inch to the\r\nfourth of an inch, in proportion to the size of the seed.\r\n\r\nLarch should also be sown in April; it succeeds best on the clean\r\nmellow ground which has produced a crop of seedling Scots fir. It is\r\nworthy of remark, that the larch seedlings and row-plants are liable to\r\ndie under a putrescent disease, when much recent manure is employed.—We\r\nremark this accordance with its tendency to putrid disease in after\r\nlife. {175}\r\n\r\nAcorns, Chestnuts, and other large seeds, may be economically sown\r\nin drill: where the soil contains much annual weed seed, this admits\r\nof expeditious cleaning by the hoe. Ground which has borne a crop of\r\npotatoes the preceding season, is unfit for seed-beds, as the tubers\r\nand seed of the potato give much trouble.\r\n\r\nThese are the chief of Mr Sang’s directions on raising timber-plants.\r\nWith the exception of kiln-drying of cones, and being rather too\r\nprodigal of manure to the seed-beds (perhaps necessary in a sale\r\nnursery), we see nothing in the volume to censure.—A premium should be\r\noffered for a convenient plan of distributing fir-seed suitably in the\r\nseed-bed, without the aid of artificial drying.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to state, that, in the culture of trees,\r\nthere are thousands of incidental circumstances to which general\r\ndirections will not apply, and which demand a discriminating judgment\r\nin the operator: this acts as a school to the mental acumen; and there\r\nis no class of operative men, which has the faculties of attention,\r\nactivity, discrimination, and judgment, more developed, than nurserymen\r\nand gardeners,—whose diversified labours, requiring, at the same time,\r\nconstant mental and corporeal exertion, keep up a proper balance of the\r\nhuman powers. {176}\r\n\r\nWe leave to the judgment of the operator to proportion the thickness\r\nof sowing of the different kinds of seed to the expected size of stem\r\nand leaf, under regulation of soil, season, and quality of seed; and\r\nto determine whether the plants may be continued more than one season\r\nin the seed-bed, or be entirely or partly drawn the first, which\r\nmust depend on their luxuriance and closeness; also to notice if all\r\nthe seeds have vegetated the first season, or if many of them still\r\nbe inert; in the latter case, the seedlings must be picked out; to\r\nfacilitate which, the earth may be gently raised by a three-pronged\r\nfork, with as little superficial disturbance as possible.\r\n\r\nIn nurseries, the great and general error is having the plants too\r\nclose together, particularly in the row. Every nursery-row plant should\r\nbe of a regular cone figure, with numerous side-branches down near to\r\nthe root, and gradually widening in the cone downwards. These would,\r\nindeed, occupy more space of package, and probably not please the\r\nignorant purchaser, who generally prefers a clean, tall body; but they\r\nwould support the hardships of removal to the moor, and be stately\r\ntrees; when the comely, straight, slender plants would either have died\r\naltogether, or have become miserable, unsightly skeletons, or stunted\r\nbushes. {177}\r\n\r\nIn cases where plants are required of considerable size, for hedge-rows\r\nor park-standards, it is matter of doubt, how far frequent removals in\r\nnursery, or cutting of roots, is profitable. This occasions fibrous\r\nmatted roots, which tend much to the success of the ultimate removal,\r\nand to the growth of the plant for several years after; but, by\r\nchecking the disposition the roots naturally have to extend by several\r\nwide-diverging leaders, probably unfit the plant for becoming a large\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nMr Sang remarks that sycamore planes and birch should not be pruned in\r\nthe latter part of the winter, as they bleed greatly at that season: we\r\nhave often noticed this as early as midwinter, which also occurs to the\r\nmaple tribe. Our author introduces the mountain-ash as a forest tree, a\r\nrank it by no means merits, at least for value as a timber tree. When\r\nexceeding six inches in diameter, it is generally rotted in the heart,\r\nand is only valuable as a copse for affording pliant, tough rods; or\r\ntwigs, as a charm or fetiche against witchcraft! It is, however, one of\r\nour most beautiful trees.\r\n\r\nMr Sang gives directions for kiln-drying fir cones previous to\r\nthrashing out, or extracting the seeds. We have before adverted to\r\nthis, and would {178} particularly reprehend the practice. It is\r\ndifficult to determine how far early fruitfulness and consequent\r\ninfirmity of constitution, diminutiveness of size at maturity, and\r\nearly decay, may originate from kiln-drying the cones; but, from the\r\nsame process of drying in a less degree having been ascertained to\r\ninduce early seed-bearing in the case of other seeds, we may infer\r\nalmost to certainty, that the coniferæ of this country, not naturally\r\nplanted, are very materially injured by this practice.\r\n\r\nIt is of small consequence, in reference to the tree itself, at what\r\nseason deciduous trees are planted, provided they be naked of leaf,\r\nand the ground not too dry, as they are not liable to lose much\r\nby desiccation or evaporation by the bark alone, before the roots\r\nstrike anew in spring, and draw freely from the soil; and the skin of\r\nthe bulb, although the small rootlets be broken, sucks up moisture\r\nfrom the damp soil to repair the loss by superior evaporation: but\r\nevergreens—firs, hollies, laurels, yews, sometimes suffer by removal at\r\na time when the roots do not immediately strike, as in winter, owing\r\nto the torpor from cold. We have often seen their juices exhausted,\r\nand their leaves entirely withered, by a continuation of dry northerly\r\nwinds, the manifest cause of which {179} was the great superficial\r\nexposure of the leaves evaporating faster than the fractured torpid\r\nroots afforded supply. Therefore, although winter planting seldom\r\nfails, yet it is perhaps better to seize the exact time in spring,\r\nimmediately before the roots commence to strike anew, before there is\r\nany new top-growth, and while the soil and air remain somewhat moist\r\nand cold, that the evaporation may not be too great. In this climate,\r\nApril is a good season for removing evergreens to the field, although,\r\nto throw the work from the busy season, it is often practised in the\r\nnursery in September, when their annual growths are completed, and\r\nwhile there is yet warmth to enable the roots to strike anew; this,\r\nhowever, is only advisable where the soil for their reception is in\r\nthe most favourable state, friable, and inclining to moist, or when\r\nthere is great indication of rain, and the air near the dew point. Of\r\ncourse they require to be planted as soon as extracted. In winter or\r\nspring, when it happens that evergreens must lie in the _shough_, the\r\nmost protected situation, where the air is moist and still, ought to\r\nbe chosen, and the earth carefully closed to their roots, which is\r\nbest done by watering, if rain be not expected; the stems and branches\r\nshould also lie as close to the ground as possible. {180}\r\n\r\nThere is appended to this valuable Planter’s Calendar a treatise on the\r\nFormation and Management of Osier Plantations. As this will not bear\r\ncompression well, we refer our reader to the volume itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n{181} III. BILLINGTON ON PLANTING.\r\n\r\nWe have perused Billington’s account of the management of the Royal\r\nForests with much profit; it affords us an excellent series of\r\nexperiments, shewing how much conduct and integrity may exist in\r\nGovernment establishments, even although the strictest watch be _not_\r\nkept over their motions by the nation itself. Words are awanting to\r\nexpress our admiration of every thing connected with the management of\r\nour misnamed Royal Wastes. We scarcely could have hoped to find such\r\npervading judgment and skill of calling, as have been displayed by the\r\nCommissioners, and Surveyors General and Particular; but it is true,\r\nthe noble salaries attached to these situations must induce men of\r\nthe very first ability and knowledge of the subject, to accept of the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nOur author, Mr Billington, proceeds with great naiveté to relate how\r\nthey sowed and resowed acorns—how they planted and replanted trees,\r\npersevering even to the fifth time, sometimes covering the roots, and\r\nsometimes not, “but all would not avail,” nothing would do; the seeds\r\ndid not vegetate, and the {182} plants refused to grow, excepting in\r\nsome rare spots, and a few general stragglers. Then how the natural\r\nrichness of the soil threw up such a flush of vegetation—of grass,\r\nand herbs, and shrubs, that most of these plants were buried under\r\nthis luxuriance; and how the mice and the emmets, and other wayfarers,\r\nhearing, by the _bruit_ of fame, of the wise men who had the governing\r\nof Dean, assembled from the uttermost ends of the island, expecting\r\na millennium in the forest, and ate up almost every plant which had\r\nsurvived the smothering. Now, this is well; we rejoice over the natural\r\njustice of the native and legitimate inhabitants of the Royal Domain,\r\nthe weeds mastering the invaders the plants, who, year after year, to\r\nthe amount of many millions, made hostile entrance into the forest. We\r\nonly deplore the cruel doom of the mice, on whose heads a price was\r\nlaid, and of the emmets, who, acting as allies of the native powers,\r\nmerited a better fate than indiscriminate slaughter.\r\n\r\nMay we hope that our Government will no longer persist in unprofitable\r\nendeavours to turn cultivator, or to raise its own supply? We laugh at\r\nthe Pasha of Egypt becoming cotton-planter and merchant himself, in a\r\ncountry where the exertions of a man enlightened beyond his subjects,\r\nwho has influence {183} to introduce intelligent cultivators,\r\npossessing the knowledge of more favoured nations, may be necessary\r\nto teach and stimulate the ignorant Copt to raise a new production:\r\nAnd here, where discovery in every branch of knowledge almost exceeds\r\nthe progressive—here, where so many public and government _fixtures_\r\nstand out, as if left on purpose to indicate the recent march of\r\nmind, contrasting so strongly with private and individual attainment\r\nin science and art,—with every thing the reverse of what affects the\r\nEgyptian’s conduct; or, at least, with no excuse beyond affording\r\na cover for a wasteful expenditure of the public money;—will our\r\nGovernment continue the system, heedless of reason or ridicule? or\r\nwill they not at once end these practices, and immediately commence\r\nsales of every acre of ground to which the Crown has claim, excepting\r\nwhat is necessary for the use of royalty, abolishing Woods and Forest\r\nGenerals, Rangers—every one who has taken rank under Jacques’ Greek,\r\nor the devil’s own invocation, and pay off a part of the debt which is\r\ncrushing the energies of the first of nations?\r\n\r\nYet it is not of individuals that we complain; perhaps nobody\r\ncould have had a stronger _desire_ to do his duty, than the late\r\nSurveyor-General. It is the system that is naught; where, to the lowest\r\n{184} labourer, none have individual interest in the success of their\r\nwork; and where the efforts of the really honest, intelligent, and\r\nindustrious are, by directions and trammels, rendered unavailing; or\r\neven through misrepresentation by _those_ of a contrary character, (as\r\nwould seem in the case of Mr Billington), are the cause of dismissal.\r\n\r\nWe can only predicate of the future from the past. In spite of all\r\nour Parliamentary acts respecting these forests, and the clamour that\r\nfor ages has been made about them, they, with little exception, have\r\nexisted only as cover for sinecure expenditure, or for display of tyro\r\nignorance and incapacity, and subject for pillage, thieving, and frauds\r\nof every description[40]; (_vide_ Parliamentary Reports). We could\r\neasily—by a very simple incantation, requiring a rod neither tipped\r\nwith silver nor with gold, but merely a plain cane or sword—bring forth\r\na sufficient quantity of large growing oaks to meet any emergency.\r\nOur charm would be to give the title of Prince to the Duke who should\r\npossess, and have at the command of Government at a fair price, a\r\ncertain {185} number of oaks above a certain size, and a step of\r\nelevation to every titled person, and the title of Baronet to every\r\nprivate gentleman, who should possess a given number, diminishing the\r\nnumber requisite to give a step as the title became lower. We should\r\nconceive this law would not render nobility of less estimation. Perhaps\r\nthe clause might be added, that one tree raised on waste ground should\r\ncount two.\r\n\r\nAs a treatise on the rearing, or rather prevention of the rearing,\r\nof young planting, Mr Billington’s small volume possesses some real\r\nmerit; and simplicity and useful and sagacious remark are so blended\r\ntogether, as to afford to the reader at once amusement and information.\r\nWe are something at a loss to account for this incongruity. Has the\r\nseclusion of a forest life given a cast of the _naturel_ to his mental\r\nproduct; or has Jaques of Arden really been in Dean with his celebrated\r\ninvocation?\r\n\r\nMr Billington’s directions on pruning and training are generally\r\ngood; but he distances common sense when on his hobby of shortening\r\nof side branches, in recommending to extend this practice to pines.\r\nHis breeding as a gardener, and consequent taste for espalier and\r\nwall-training, where every shoot must be under especial direction, seem\r\nto have {186} unfitted his mind to expand to the comprehension of\r\nnature’s own process of action, and disqualified him from walking hand\r\nin hand with her. We also consider that no good, but rather evil, would\r\nresult from continued cutting in, and lopping off the points of the\r\nbranches of all kinds of trees, excepting when the plants were stunted,\r\nor much covered with flower-buds. Even a very slight clipping greatly\r\nretards the growth of hedges; and the labour and attention requisite\r\nwould be very great: besides, the poor things, the trees, trimmed to\r\nthe Billingtonian standard, would, amongst the unrestrained beauties\r\nof the forest, be ready to sink into the earth for very shame of their\r\n_formal deformity_. He errs, too, in recommending not to plant sycamore\r\nplane, as being of little value while young. We have sold young planes,\r\nsix or seven inches in diameter, at a higher price per foot than large\r\noak. They will generally find a good market wherever machinery abounds,\r\nand will probably become every year in greater request.\r\n\r\nMr Billington is particularly solicitous to render his instructions\r\nas plain as possible, in describing the mode of pruning young oaks\r\nin formation of knee timber, as he confesses to bring it down to the\r\ncomprehension of gentlemen; but he is not very happy in his figures\r\nof oak trees trained to this use, from {187} want of acquaintance\r\nwith the cutting out of naval crooks. He remarks that “larches are\r\nmore liable to die in wet ground by their roots being soaked in water\r\nduring winter, than oak and some other kinds;” but ground that is at\r\nall pervious to water, ought not to be planted till it be drained in\r\nsuch a manner that water will soon disappear from shallow holes; and\r\nwhere, from the plastic closeness of the clay, draining is not quite\r\neffectual, the planting should take place as late in the spring as the\r\nbreaking of the buds will permit; and principally by slitting, which,\r\nby not breaking the natural coherence or turfiness of the soil, affords\r\nless opening for water to stagnate around the roots, and does not\r\noccasion the soil to sink down into the mortary consistence consequent\r\nto pitting; there is also less destruction of the vegetables growing\r\nin the soil, hence less putrescent matter to taint the water that may\r\nstagnate round the roots; pure water, or water in motion, not being\r\ndetrimental to the roots for a considerable time: also, when the\r\nplants are put in late in spring, there is seldom long stagnation of\r\nwater that season, and by next winter the ground has become so firmed\r\naround the roots as to allow very little space for water, and has\r\nalso acquired a certain granular arrangement akin to polarization or\r\ncrystallization, which {188} allows the water gradually to percolate;\r\nit is also bored by the earth-worm, and other insects, and the plant\r\nitself, after the roots have struck anew and the fractures healed,\r\npossesses a vitality which better enables it to withstand the exclusion\r\nof air from the roots, and chilling by the water the ensuing winter,\r\nand either prevents absorption of the stagnant fluid, or counteracts\r\nits putrid tendency. Planting succeeds best in soil of this description\r\nwhen the ground has been under grass for some period, at least the\r\nnew planted tree, in this case, is less liable to the root-rot; and\r\ntrenching or digging previous to planting is of more utility, as the\r\nturfiness prevents the clay from sinking down into impervious mortar,\r\nand allows the water to percolate to the drains.\r\n\r\nMr Billington is very earnest in recommending to drain well at first,\r\nand to keep the drains (open drains) in repair; he also directs, where\r\nthe ground is very impervious and wet, to take large square sods, about\r\n18 inches square and 9 inches thick, from the drains while digging in\r\nearly winter, and place one of these, the grassy side undermost, in\r\nthe site which each plant is to occupy. In the spring, by the time of\r\nplanting, the sod has become firmly fixed, and the two swards rotting\r\nafford an excellent nourishment to the plant, which is inserted in\r\nthe {189} centre of the sod, with the roots as deep as the original\r\nsurface; the drains, being necessarily numerous, afford turf sufficient\r\nfor all the plants. This is good. He also gives sensible directions\r\nto beat down, hoe, or cut away all weeds, shrubs, and grass, from the\r\nyoung plants, and to remove all rough herbage and thickets of shrubs,\r\nthat form harbour for the short-tailed mouse, which is exceedingly\r\ndestructive, in the case both of planting and sowing; in the former,\r\nby nibbling the bark from the stem, and biting off the twigs of the\r\nyoung trees, (from which our author may have taken the hint of cutting\r\nin, as mankind took that of pruning from the browsing of the ass), and\r\ngnawing their roots immediately below the surface of the ground; and\r\nin the latter, by devouring the seed in the ground, and cutting down\r\nthe seedling annual shoot. He also instructs to keep the tree to one\r\nleader, shortening all straggling large branches; but his assertion,\r\nthat plants which had the tops of the straggling branches pinched off\r\nin the first part of summer, grew much larger in consequence, looks\r\nrather absurd; although we have known a part of a hedge, clipped a week\r\nor two after the growth had commenced in spring, grow more luxuriantly\r\nthan the part which had been pruned in the same manner before the\r\ngrowth had {190} commenced. This was owing to the check by the late\r\nclipping, throwing the period of growth into warm moist July; what was\r\nearlier clipped performed its growth in dry June, and was considerably\r\ninjured by the manna blight which the latter escaped[41]. The same\r\ncause operates to induce late sown grain and wheat, which has been\r\nthrown late by much injury of spring frost, to acquire a larger, more\r\nluxuriant bulk, than that of earlier growth.\r\n\r\nIt would appear to us that Mr Billington, from ignorance of the value\r\nof larch, and of the soil proper for maturing it, has done more\r\ninjury to the parts of the royal forests where a growth of timber was\r\nobtained, by cutting out the thriving larch, than will be compensated\r\nby his pruning and training of the sickly stunted oak which remained,\r\nas described by him, scarcely visible, when the larches were of size\r\nfor country use; but we forget; no blame can attach to him—his orders\r\nwere, that every thing should give place to oak. {191}\r\n\r\nIn parting with our author, it is but just to state, that we consider\r\nmany may profit by a perusal of his pages: that notwithstanding the\r\nsimplicity to which we have alluded, there is often something sterling\r\nin his remarks and reflections, the result of much experience,\r\nresembling the original freshness of our writers before writing became\r\nso much of a trade. In some places, indeed, his narrative is so\r\nsimply, naturally descriptive, and speaks so eloquently, of ignorance\r\nof climate, season, soil, circumstance—of all the unknown dangers and\r\ndifficulties incident to _their_ new employment—and of the wonderful\r\ncontrivances and inventions hit upon to remedy them—that, when perusing\r\nit, we could scarcely persuade ourselves we were not engaged with\r\nRobinson Crusoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n{192} IV.—FORSYTH ON FRUIT AND FOREST TREES.\r\n\r\nThe _surgery of trees_, which this author has the great merit of\r\nalmost perfecting, is the only important matter in this volume. His\r\ncomposition salve, on the merits of which he expatiates so much, and\r\nfor the discovery of which he received a premium from the collective\r\nwisdom of the nation assembled in Parliament, is, however, a piece of\r\nmere quackery; and all the virtue of his practice lies in the cutting\r\nout of the dead and diseased parts of the tree, thus effecting for\r\nvegetables by excision, what nature herself performs for animals by\r\nsuppuration, exfoliation, and absorption.\r\n\r\nMr Forsyth’s surgery is of slight importance to timber trees in respect\r\nof economy, as with them as with man, it is generally easier to raise\r\nup anew than cure the diseased. Yet it is well that the rationale of\r\nthis practice be understood by foresters, more in regard to prevention\r\nthan cure; an occasion will however sometimes occur where a tree may\r\neconomically be benefited by surgical aid: and in cases where the {193}\r\nDryades acquire lasting attachment to particular objects, the science\r\nis invaluable, as the object of their love may be thus continued\r\nflourishing to the end of time, or as long as the inamorata chooses to\r\npay the surgeon.\r\n\r\nMr Forsyth presents us with numerous models of knives, irons, and\r\ngouges, suited to the operation of removing the dead parts of his\r\npatients. Where the gangrene occurs in the outside, he hews and scrapes\r\naway with these till every portion in which the vital principle is\r\nextinct be detached, and the surface all regular and smooth, so\r\nscooped out as to afford no hollow where water may rest. He then\r\ngives a coating of his composition salve to all the space operated\r\non, wherever the cuticle of the bark has been broken, which prevents\r\nthe drought, rain or air, from injuring the bared parts till the bark\r\nspread over it. In cases where the removal of all the dead part at once\r\nwould endanger the stability of the tree, he first removes it along\r\nthe borders of the decayed part all round, close to the sound bark,\r\nof such a breadth as to give full room for the bark to spread over in\r\none season, and covers this with his pigment, annually repeating the\r\ncutting out, and painting around the rim or edge of the new-formed\r\nbark, till the whole of the dead part be cleared away. {194} Under\r\nthis treatment, the excavation is gradually filled up with the new\r\nwood forming under the spreading bark, and the wound becomes cleanly\r\ncicatrized. Mr Forsyth has effected complete renovation, where the\r\nsound vital part consisted only of a narrow stripe of bark and alburnum\r\nupon one side of the stem, and where two cart loads of the diseased\r\ntrunk had been scooped out.\r\n\r\nWhen the heart of the tree is decayed, he makes a section\r\nlongitudinally in the side of the tree, as far up and down as the rot\r\nextends, and of sufficient width to admit the working out the diseased\r\npart; and managed as above, the bark and wood gradually extend from\r\nthe two sides of the section into the vacuity, and fill it up entirely\r\nwith new sound timber. When the tree is of considerable diameter, the\r\nopening formed in the side of the stem must be wide, nearly extending\r\nto half the circumference, otherwise the sides of the section would\r\nmeet before the bark extended over all the inside. When the bark from\r\nthe two sides approaches to touch in the bottom of the hollow, he pares\r\noff the cuticle from each side where they join, in order that they may\r\nunite thoroughly. Should any of the roots be diseased, he removes the\r\nearth, and pares away the corrupting parts; and if the top be stunted\r\nor {195} sickly, he crops it at the joints where the smaller branches\r\nseparate, whence numerous fine strong shoots spring forth, whose new\r\nvigour of vegetation, and absence of drain by seeding for several\r\nyears, generally renovate the whole plant, and occasion the filling up\r\nof the wounds (should the trunk be under cure) to proceed rapidly.\r\n\r\nNeed we mention, that it is only in the cases where the partial death\r\nor decay has resulted from casualty, or something not connected with\r\nthe general system of the plant, or with the soil, or other external\r\ncircumstances (unless these can be changed), that renovation by\r\nclearing away the decayed or sickly parts is attainable? Where the\r\nplant is sinking from mere old age, a source of decay of which in\r\nsome kinds at least we have doubts, or from the soil being improper\r\nor exhausted for the particular kind of plant by long occupancy, or\r\nfrom any circumstance not admitting of remedy, the attempt to heal up\r\nthe wounds caused by cutting out the diseased parts, or to induce new\r\nvigour by cropping the top, must be abortive, or only attended with\r\npartial or temporary success.\r\n\r\nOur author, who is a practical man, apparently very little disposed\r\nto throw away time upon inquiring into causes, does not attempt even\r\nto guess at {196} the mode by which his composition performs the\r\nwonders for which he gives it credit. It is impossible, by any salve,\r\nto promote discharge from the bare alburnum, though cut into the\r\nvital part, to form, or assist in the formation, of bark; and the\r\nsum of the resulting advantages consists in preventing the vitality\r\nfrom becoming extinct far inward from the section (as under the best\r\nmanagement to a certain extent it will become so), by an antiseptic\r\ncover from the drought and moisture, heat and cold; in promoting the\r\nspread of the juices from the edge of the bark over the bared part by\r\nexclusion of drought, and by forming a defence against insects. We\r\nhave found a paste of pure clay, wrought up with some fibrous matter,\r\nas chaff or short hay, an excellent cover for tree wounds, applied in\r\nspring or early summer, when dry weather followed the application; but\r\nin autumn or winter, and when moist weather followed, the clay, by\r\nremaining wet, only served to induce corruption. We think this clay\r\npaste (probably benefited by a powdering of charcoal on the inside) the\r\nbest application when applied in spring. We have seen a terminal cross\r\nsection, of about one inch diameter, of a long branch, covered quite\r\nover in two months with bark when clayed; and a tree of three inches\r\nin diameter, from {197} which a dog had torn off the bark from one\r\nhalf of the circumference of the stem, entirely renew the lost bark\r\nin one season, when immediately clayed over. Resins, oils, bitumen,\r\npaints and composts without number, have been used with more or less\r\nsuccess, depending upon the period of the year, weather, kind of tree,\r\nindividual health, and other circumstances; but these salves should, as\r\nin flesh-wound salves, be considered only as protections, or slightly\r\nauxiliary to the restorative energy of nature, not as cures.\r\n\r\n\r\n{198} V.—MR WITHERS.\r\n\r\nHaving by chance glanced over a pamphlet by an Englishman, a Mr\r\nWithers, we find there has been jousting between that gentleman and our\r\nScottish knights, backed by their squire the Edinburgh Reviewer, in\r\nwhich the discomfiture of the knights has been wrought by simple hands.\r\n\r\nIt seems Sir Henry Steuart, forgetful that his own bright fame, which\r\nrivals that of the discoverers of steam-power and gas[42], though of\r\ncomparatively quick growth, will endure for ages; and led astray,\r\nprobably, by the foolish adage, “soon ripe, soon rotten,” had stated\r\nunqualifiedly, that “fast grown timber will sooner decay, and is of\r\nopener weaker texture than slow grown of the same kind;” and on these\r\nfalse premises concluded, that all culture or application of manure to\r\nfurther the growth of timber is improper—winding up with some patriotic\r\nflourish about danger to our war navy, from Mr Withers {199} rendering\r\nthe British oak of such exceedingly rapid growth as to be soft and\r\nperishable as mushrooms. Withers completely demolishes his literary\r\nand scientific adversaries, but is, withal, so very imperfectly\r\nacquainted with the subject—himself, and also his junto of experienced\r\ncorrespondents, that we shall attempt a few lines in elucidation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall first state our facts, accompanied with explanatory remarks.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. An ash tree of about 18 inches diameter, and 65 years of age.\r\nThe first 35 years, the annual growths were of middle size, and the\r\ntimber weighty and tough; the following 15 years, very small, light,\r\nporous, and free; the latter 15 of middle size, and of fair quality.\r\nThis tree had been growing till about 49 years of age in a grassy\r\navenue, of dry clay soil, and close by a deep ditch. About sixteen\r\nyears back, the ditch had been filled up, and the ground ploughed and\r\nmanured regularly till the tree was cut down. After 35 years’ growth,\r\nthe scorching roots of the ash had rendered the soil so dry, that the\r\ntree had run entirely to reproduction: _Nearly all the nourishment from\r\nthe ground assimilated in the leaves being expended in forming seed, no\r\nextension of the top had taken place, and_ {200} _thence no thickening\r\nof the bole being necessary for support, no wood proper had been\r\ndeposited on the trunk save the annual rings of lineal tubes to convey\r\nthe sap, which constituted a brittle light wood, of very slight lateral\r\nadhesion_[43]. After the ditch was filled up, and the surrounding\r\nground ploughed and manured, the increased supply of moisture and\r\nnourishment had induced a considerable new extension of top (which was\r\nquite visible in fine young healthy branches rising from a stunted\r\nbase), and consequent necessary thickening of stem by annual layers of\r\nproper dense wood, along with the lineal annual tubes.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. A beautiful most luxuriant growing oak, in one of the sweetest\r\nsunny spots of the sweetest valley of our Highlands. This tree,\r\nof nearly two hundred solid feet of timber, and 80 years of age,\r\nwas growing upon the bare shelf of a sound mica-schist rock. From\r\nunderneath this shelf, several feet down in front, a most exuberant\r\nspring welled out, and the roots spread down over {201} the rock to\r\nthe mouth of the crystal spring, no doubt tracing inward the course\r\nof the limpid waters into the rocky chambers of the Naiad. We had\r\nmuch conjecture how this tree came to be growing on the bare shelf,\r\nand finally concluded, that the nymph of the spring, while she sat\r\nthere gazing on her beauties, under the varying dimpling reflection\r\nof the living waters, her rosy feet bathed by the glassy flood, had\r\nbeen surprised by some rude Celt, and to effect escape from his rough\r\nembrace, had been transformed by Diana into a tree. Yet whether of\r\nnatural or supernatural origin, it was by the people of the glen held\r\nof miraculous virtue, and the sickly children were brought to be dipped\r\nin the spring after being borne several times round the charm-tree.\r\nWhen torn from its seat, the tree, though sound, and having a level\r\nfall (we saw it fall), broke across about twenty feet up, where the\r\nstem was about eight feet in circuit; _this was owing to the very\r\nsoft tender nature of the wood, which, although consisting of very\r\nlarge annual growths, was, when sawn out, the most porous insufficient\r\nScots oak we have ever seen_. As this fact may be ascribed to the\r\nsupernatural,—the heart of the nymph beginning to soften towards the\r\nCelt at the time Diana interfered, accounting well for {202} the soft\r\ntexture of the heart-wood of the tree, we shall not press it as a proof\r\non either side of the controversy. Perhaps sober reasoners may think\r\nthis all phantasy, and conclude, that the tree, from deficiency of\r\nsubstantial earthy food, and subsisting principally on _slops_ (being\r\nmainly nourished by drinking of the delicious well), would, like an\r\nanimal under similar circumstances, be of soft flabby consistency.\r\n\r\nThe above fact is opposed to common opinion—a Highlander always\r\nchoosing his oaken staff from off a rock, as being most to depend upon;\r\nyet perhaps this preference is owing to some association with the\r\nhardness of the rock itself.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. We found a sycamore plane (Acer pseudo-platanus) in the same\r\nrow with other sycamores, and about the same size, so exceeding hard\r\nthat it could scarcely be cut down by mattock and hatchet, whereas\r\nthe others adjacent were comparatively of moderate hardness, though\r\ndiffering considerably in hardness from each other; the soil in this\r\ncase was very equable, being of Carse clay. The peculiar hardness of\r\nthis tree could only be attributable to a harder variety. Indeed,\r\nthe difference of quality in timber depends chiefly on the infinite\r\nvarieties existing in what is called Species, though soil and {203}\r\nclimate have no doubt considerable influence, both in forming the\r\nvariety, and in modifying it while growing. Of varieties, those which\r\nhave the thinnest bark, under equal exposure, have the hardest wood.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. We have cut a number of large old ash trees, and found, with one\r\nor two exceptions, of what is called thunder-struck trees (which we\r\nconsider only an obdurate variety), that they were invariably of very\r\nfree, weak consistency, more especially the latter formed growths, but\r\neven the earlier growths had become _frush_ from age. This timber soon\r\nwent to decay after being cut down:—one piece cut out into planks, and\r\nthese being laid down in the order they occupied in the log, was in the\r\ncourse of some weeks rendered again entire by being agglutinated by\r\nJew’s ears (a species of fungus.) The workmen were greatly startled at\r\nthe fact, thinking the log bewitched. When immediately dissevered by\r\nwedges, the wood was so much decomposed, that its fibre was tenderer\r\nthan the Jew’s ears, separating in a new course in most places, in\r\npreference to the saw draught occupied by the ears. We have found very\r\nold oaks have exactly the same friable character, so much so, as render\r\ntheir safe felling almost impossible; yet this oak timber had not lost\r\nmuch in weight {204} when compared after being dried with younger oak.\r\n\r\nNo. 5. We cut a row of ash trees, about 50 years of age, in dry Carse\r\nclay, by the side of a deep ditch, and consequently of slow growth; the\r\ntimber was excellent, hard, strong, and weighty, rather most so where\r\nthe size was smallest. At one end, where the row approached a brook,\r\nand the soil became richer and moister, several of the trees were of\r\ngood size, but rather inferior in quality of timber, excepting one (the\r\nlargest, though not the nearest to the brook), which was of very hard,\r\nstrong, and reedy fibre, evidently a variety differing much from the\r\nothers. It is always easy to discriminate pretty accurately the quality\r\nof the wood, by examination of the saw cross section of the trunk, that\r\nis, provided the same saw be employed, and be kept equally sharp; the\r\nbest timber having the glossiest, smoothest section.\r\n\r\nNo. 6. We have examined Scots fir grown in many different situations;\r\nby far the best quality, of its age, of any we know, stands upon a\r\nvery adhesive Carse clay, which, from the proprietor’s neglect, is all\r\nwinter and in wet weather soaking with water, and the trees not of very\r\nluxuriant growth. These, till a few years ago, stood in close order,\r\nwithout the stem being {205} much exposed to parching or evaporation;\r\nthis exposure of the stem rendering fir timber much harder and more\r\nresinous. Every body who has touched larch must be convinced that the\r\nslow grown on poor _tills_, especially with long naked stems in exposed\r\nsituation, is very much stronger and harder than the quick grown,\r\nthough often not so tough: but much depends on the variety in larch,\r\nthose having the reddest matured wood being much harder than the paler\r\ncoloured.\r\n\r\nMemel fir, which is the largest growthed red pine we are acquainted\r\nwith, is very strong and durable, probably next to the pitch pine of\r\nNorth America; yet the very large growthed Memel is generally weakest,\r\nthough we frequently find a log of small growthed, mild and inferior in\r\nstrength. In old buildings we have often witnessed the beautiful small\r\ngrowthed red wood pine wormed, when the larger growthed was sound,\r\nbut we are sensible that spontaneous decomposition and consumption\r\nby insects are very different; much resin deters insects, whereas,\r\nin moist situations, as in treenails of vessels, it conduces to\r\nspontaneous decay; yet is it preservative when the timber is exposed to\r\nthe weather by excluding the rain. {206}\r\n\r\nThe coniferæ differ much in the internal arrangement of their woody\r\nstructure from the hard wood species, having tissue of much larger\r\ncells, and being generally destitute of the large lineal tubes, which\r\nin hard wood constitute the more porous inner part of the annual layer.\r\nWhen these tubes occur in the pines, they also differ in position,\r\nbeing in the outer part of the layer. Owing to the resin of the pines\r\nbecoming fixed in the cells of the outer part of the annual layers,\r\ninspissated, we think, by the summer’s heat and drought (others say\r\ncongealed by the cold), these cells are filled up, and this part of\r\nthe growth rendered much denser than the inner part of the layer,\r\nbeing from solidity semi-transparent. We would attribute the abundance\r\nof resin in the Georgian pitch pine to the heat and long summer of\r\nthat country, probably in concert with damp richness of soil, not\r\nonly occasioning this deposit under these circumstances, but perhaps\r\ninducing a disposition in this species to the formation of this\r\nproduct[44]. The absence of the large tubes, {207} and the presence\r\nof oleaginous resin, render pine timber, when old and small growthed,\r\nnot so brittle, nor so liable to decay, as that of deciduous trees; but\r\nit becomes very deficient in lateral adhesion. From the same cause we\r\nfind the external layers of matured pine timber comparatively superior\r\nto the quality of the inner layers: in hard wood the exterior layers\r\nare generally much inferior to the inner. Boards of sap-wood of fast\r\ngrown Scots fir, particularly of the outside layers are much better\r\nsuited—stronger and more lasting, for boxes used as carriage packages,\r\nor for machinery or cart lining much exposed to blows and friction;\r\nthan boards of the best matured red wood of Memel, Swedish, or Norway\r\npine. This is principally owing to the fast grown alburnum possessing\r\nmuch greater lateral adhesion than the matured wood of old pines. To\r\nhave these sap-wood boards in greatest perfection, the tree must {208}\r\nnot lie in the bark after felling, and the boards must be well dried\r\nsoon after being cut out. To expose the tree, peeled, either standing\r\nor felled, to the sun and dry air for some time, will considerably\r\nincrease the strength of this alburnum. The wood, while in the state\r\nof sap-wood, of many kinds of timber is as strong and much tougher\r\nthan the same wood after being matured, and would be equally valuable\r\nwere any process discovered of rendering it equally durable; its\r\ninsufficiency often arises from partial decay having occurred while in\r\nthe log. The same sap-wood of oak, which, allowed to lie on the grass\r\nafter being peeled in spring, will be so much decomposed in autumn that\r\nit may be kicked off with one’s heel; if cut out and dried immediately\r\non being felled, it will be tougher than the matured, and, kept dry\r\nas cart-spokes, and defended by paint from the worm, will last and\r\nretain its toughness for an age. The tilling up, which to a certain\r\nextent occurs in maturing, is most probably deposited to fill up tubes,\r\nand may thus not greatly strengthen the mass; a hollow cylinder being\r\nstronger than a solid cylinder when extending horizontally over a\r\nconsiderable stretch, like a joist or beam; the mass may also become\r\na little more fragile by maturing: besides a filling up is the result\r\nof some chemical change the {209} wood probably becoming slightly\r\ncarbonized or approaching to that change which takes place when\r\nvegetables become peat.\r\n\r\nIt is rather difficult to speak of the strength of timber, as different\r\nkinds of timber, and different parts and qualities of the same kind\r\nof timber, have different kinds of strength. Some kinds are stronger\r\nas beams or joists, other kinds as boarding; while, again, some kinds\r\nare better for enduring a regular pressure, others for supporting a\r\nsudden jerk or blow, either as beams or boards. Some kinds are also\r\ncomparatively stronger, moist; others when dry—and some kinds retain\r\ntheir qualities of strength or toughness longer than others when moist,\r\nand others longer when dry, although no rot appear.\r\n\r\nNo. 7. Purposely for experiment[45], we selected three ash trees, all\r\ngrowing in Carse clay, but differing the most in fastness of growth of\r\nany we could discover. We cut these down on the same day; two of them\r\nproved about 36 years planted, and the third 15; this, the youngest\r\nwas of fast growth, and had layers of more than double the size of one\r\nof the {210} former, and about six times that of the other. We cut a\r\nnumber of pieces of exactly equal length and thickness (17 inches long,\r\nand nearly an inch on the side), from each of these, choosing them\r\nof clean straight fibre, at equal distance from the ground, and from\r\nthe outside of the tree, and having their growths nearly parallel to\r\none side, of course free of heart. We proved one of each immediately\r\non being cut out while full of sap, with their growths on edge in\r\nhorizontal position, supported at each end with a weight suspended from\r\nthe middle. The smallest growthed, and the largest, weighed at the time\r\nof trial nearly equal; the medium growthed one-thirtieth more. The\r\nsmallest growthed supported the weight about six minutes; the medium\r\nand the largest about half that time; the smallest growthed yielded\r\nthe least before breaking, and the largest yielded the most. When\r\ncompletely dried, the weight of the medium growthed still continued\r\ngreatest, surpassing the largest one-fourteenth, and the smallest about\r\none-thirtieth. The smallest and medium supported nearly equal weight,\r\nduring equal time, and outbore the largest about one-seventh[46]; when\r\nplaced {211} with the growths on edge, they were stronger than when\r\nplaced with the growths flat.\r\n\r\nAfter these rather lengthy references to facts, we must allude to a\r\ncircumstance which we are astonished has not been attended to by Mr\r\nWithers, and his gentlemen correspondents connected with His Majesty’s\r\ndocks,—the not taking into account the place of the tree whence the\r\nportion of wood for experimenting the strength had been taken, and also\r\nhow the annual layers stood, whether horizontal or on edge, or around\r\na centre, when the weight was applied. The experienced and accurately\r\npractical Mr Withers presents two specimens of oak, the one of faster\r\nand the other of slower growth, to Professor Barlow, of Woolwich Royal\r\nAcademy, and the strength of these specimens is tested and reported\r\nupon, without once alluding to what we have mentioned above. Now, if\r\nthis has not been attended to, the experiment may be considered a test\r\nof something else than of the timber. How much the strength is affected\r\nby the place of the tree, any person may satisfy himself by proving\r\none piece of timber taken from near the root, another half way up the\r\ntree, and a third near the top: he will find that in a tall tree the\r\ncomparative {212} strength will sometimes vary as much as 3, 2, 1;\r\nthat is, a beam, say 2 inches square, and 4 feet long, taken from near\r\nthe root, when horizontally placed, and resting only at each end, will\r\nsupport three times as much as a like beam in like position from near\r\nthe top of the tree, although both are equally clear of knots or cross\r\nsection of grain. This is particularly manifest in large fast-grown\r\nsilver fir and old ash, and the difference is always greatest in old\r\ntrees. He will also find that the position of the beam, in respect to\r\nthe layers being circular round the heart, flat, on edge, or at an\r\nangle, has considerable influence, and, should he inquire farther, will\r\nperhaps notice, that the timber from different sides of the tree is\r\nnot always alike strong; that one specimen of timber will be superior\r\nto another, both being moist, and inferior to it when both are dry,\r\nand that also, as in No. 1, the tree at the same height on the same\r\nside, will contain timber differing in strength fully one half, and not\r\nalways diminishing in strength from the heart outwards, even in hard\r\nwood. We are well pleased with one gentleman of the Navy Dock-yard, who\r\nnaively admits, that he is incompetent to decide on these subjects,\r\nhaving been altogether devoted to the mathematical, in estimating\r\nthe strain and resistance timber suffers under {213} different\r\ncombinations. Now we like this division of labour.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our subject. The facts stated go to prove, that the\r\nquality of timber depends much upon soil, circumstance, and more\r\nespecially on variety; and that in the early period of the growth of\r\ntrees, before much seeding, and when the soil is not much exhausted of\r\nthe particular pabulum necessary for the kind of plant, that rather\r\nslow grown timber is superior in strength to quick grown, especially\r\nwhen the quickness exceeds a certain degree; when this degree is\r\nexceeded, the timber is not so weighty, and is well known not to be so\r\ndurable. However, when timber is required of considerable scantling, it\r\nis only in good soils, where the tree increases moderately fast, that\r\ntimber will attain sufficient size for this, at an age young enough\r\nto retain its toughness throughout, or to continue forming firm dense\r\nwood on the exterior. This is particularly so in the case of hard-wood\r\ntimber, more especially when oak grows upon a moist soil, where the\r\nmatured wood, of brownish-red colour, is often unsound, and where\r\ndecay commences at a comparatively early period. In the pine, owing to\r\nthe oleaginous undrying nature of the sap (resin), the {214} timber\r\nretains its strength to a great age; and the reedy closeness of slow\r\ngrowth, for most purposes, outbalances any loss from deficiency of\r\nlateral adhesion.\r\n\r\nModerately fast grown timber is much more requisite for naval purposes\r\nthan for other uses; as, besides the greater longitudinal strength\r\nwhen of large dimension, it has greater adhesion laterally, is far\r\nmore pliant, and therefore much better suited for the ribs of vessels,\r\nwhere cross cutting a portion of the fibre, from the inattention to\r\ntraining to proper bends, is unavoidable; and whence a disrupting\r\nshock (which is rather to be withstood than fair pressure), makes the\r\nunyielding splintering old wood fly like ice; the rift commencing its\r\nrun from the cut fibre. For plank, the lateral adhesion and pliancy\r\nof young moderately fast grown timber is equally valuable, especially\r\nfor those which are applied to the curvature of the bow and stern.\r\nYoung timber also softens much better by steam, therefore is more\r\nconvenient for planking, and for being bent for the compass timbers\r\nof large vessels. The vessel constructed of it will besides, from the\r\ngeneral elasticity of the fibre, be more lively in the water, sail\r\nfaster, and, though stronger to resist, will {215} have less strain\r\nto endure[47]. Mr Withers’s corresponding friends, especially those of\r\nhis Majesty’s Dock-yards, with the good common sense of practical men,\r\nare well acquainted with all this, although they get a little out of\r\nelement when they meddle with nature or causes. Mr Withers is himself\r\nequally out of element when he expatiates on the mighty advantage of\r\ntrenching and manuring at planting, and when he talks of our Scottish\r\nholes. The Knight, too, is still more at fault in dreading any great\r\ninfluence on the quickness of the growth of trees from this gentleman’s\r\n_new inventions_,—and doubly at fault, from conjecturing our navy would\r\nsuffer from being constructed of the fastest grown British timber there\r\nis any chance of our shipwrights obtaining. Since we were in our teens,\r\nwe have almost every season trenched a portion of ground for planting,\r\nand have manured highly at planting[48], {216} and for several years\r\nafterwards. We have found, when very adhesive subsoil was brought\r\nupward, that the trees throve _well_ while the ground continued under\r\ncultivation; but when the labour ceased, they were soon overtaken by\r\nthose planted at the same time without trenching. This comparative\r\nfalling off was evidently owing to the surface being rendered more\r\nadhesive by the gluey plastic subsoil being mixed upward with the\r\noriginal small portion of surface-mould. This new surface melted to a\r\npulp by the winter rains, when drought set in spring, run together,\r\nbecame indurated, and parting into divisions, admitted the drought down\r\nto the unstirred ground by numerous deep and wide cracks, which rent\r\nthe rootlets of the trees, and rendered it impossible for any plant to\r\nthrive. There are also many kinds of light subsoil, which it would be\r\nfolly to bring to the surface, and where little profit would arise from\r\ndeep stirring, even though the surface were retained uppermost.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the plants were very small, we have found deep trenching\r\nof no benefit, but in certain {217} soils rather hurtful, even during\r\nthe first years; but with larger plants, such as are often used in\r\nEngland, it invariably occasioned their roots to strike quickly, by\r\naffording a regular supply of moisture, and from being easily permeated\r\nby the rootlets, expedited the growth, yielding much early luxuriance\r\nwhen followed by skilful culture, but latterly, seldom to such a degree\r\nas would lead us to suppose much difference would be discernible at 30\r\nyears of age, between the trenched and those planted by mere pitting,\r\nslitting, or sowing,—much more depending on proper draining, on young,\r\nthriving, small sturdy plants, of best variety,—on suiting the plant to\r\nthe soil and climate, and on timely thinning.\r\n\r\nBut even were a very superior ultimate progress of growth obtained by\r\ntrenching, manuring, and culture of timber, yet as capital and manure\r\nwill _probably_ be more advantageously employed in common agriculture,\r\nwhich gives a comparatively quick return of both, we shall leave to\r\nMr Withers and his coterie of illuminati the whole advantage of his\r\ndiscovery. Economic philosophy is the queen of our Scottish plants; she\r\nwill not admit any new system of nurture for her subjects without the\r\n{218} strictest scrutiny of its utility as applied to her domains,—she\r\nproceeds thus to weigh Mr Withers’s practice:—\r\n\r\n _Extra Cost per Acre._\r\n\r\n Twenty loads of putrescent manure, at the average price at\r\n   which thousands of tons are annually imported to the valley\r\n   of the Tay from _England_, 9s. per load,         L. 9  0  0\r\n\r\n Carriage expenses of above, at 3s. per load,               3  0  0\r\n\r\n Twenty loads calcareous manure, including\r\n   carriage (were marl not at hand, lime would\r\n   cost thrice as much),                             4  0  0\r\n\r\n Trenching,                                          9  0  0\r\n\r\n       Total first extra cost,                    L.25  0  0\r\n\r\n Accumulation by 28 years’ interest, at 5 per\r\n   cent. nearly,                                 L.100  0  0\r\n\r\nWould land under timber 28 years planted, with growth accelerated\r\nby Mr Withers’s practice, in two-thirds of the available portion of\r\nScotland, sell at more than L. 100 per English acre? Suppose that the\r\nthinnings previous to the 28th year would cover the cost of planting,\r\nand subsequent cultivation and attention which is necessary, besides\r\n{219} the cost of the trenching and manuring (in many cases they\r\nwould not), the entire value of the land would be lost. It may be said\r\nthat the common rules of utility do not apply in this case,—that the\r\nlandlords will not be moved to any other improvement than planting,\r\nand that otherwise their income would be dissipated entirely, without\r\nany portion being applied to reproductive uses. We grant all this;\r\nbut Scottish landlords have very little taste for the Withers’\r\nsystem,—to deface their beautiful wastes, by burying all the fine\r\nturf and wildflowers under the red mortar (the common subsoil), or to\r\nscatter manure. Planting by pitting and slitting will prove far more\r\nattractive; besides, the means are entirely awanting to carry on such\r\nexpensive proceedings to the necessary extent, and the cultivation of\r\none acre in this fashion would leave 19 untouched, when the whole 20\r\nmight have been wooded, in many cases to equal advantage, by the money\r\nexpended on one. We have known planting executed by contract for one\r\nyear’s interest of the above stated first extra expenditure, which\r\nwe would match against planting raised by Mr Withers’s process, in\r\nthe same situation. There is also a very considerable proportion of\r\nScotland very suitable for {220} timber where the stony nature of the\r\nsurface entirely precludes trenching.\r\n\r\nMr Withers, who appears to have no general knowledge of soils and\r\nclimates, would hold a different language with regard to Scotland and\r\nScotsmen, if he saw the beautiful thriving plantations now rising in\r\nthat country, planted by mere pitting and slitting, where, owing to\r\nthe drought in early summer being less fierce than what occurs in\r\nthe central, eastern, and southern counties of England, and to the\r\nherbage being less luxuriant, planting without trenching can always\r\nbe depended upon. Mr Withers would also have been sensible had he had\r\nmuch practice in rural affairs, that twenty loads of putrid manure per\r\nacre at planting, although of very considerable advantage for two or\r\nthree seasons to the rising trees, in promoting, along with hoeing and\r\ndigging, an early start to luxuriance, would cause little or no lasting\r\namelioration of the soil; That the vegetable mould naturally occupying\r\nthe surface is generally by itself a much better defence against the\r\nsummer’s drought, than when incorporated with the subsoil, especially\r\nafter cultivation ceases; that lasting fertility of ground for timber,\r\nthough sometimes, is often not increased by admixture of soil {221}\r\nand subsoil; and that, generally, the luxuriance of the tree must\r\nultimately depend on the natural depth and quality of the ground itself.\r\n\r\nMr Withers, with that precise knowledge of the subject, and clear\r\nconception of the nature of things, which generally accompanies\r\na partial acquaintance with facts, makes a confident and rather\r\nimposing appearance as a wielder of language and a logician. From his\r\nassumed superiority, we especially wonder that he should possibly\r\nhave envy of Scotsmen, which, from the tenor of his letter, we are\r\nconstrained to believe. Need Caledonia remind her noble sister,\r\nEngland, of their consanguinity,—that they are sisters whom nature\r\nhath _twinned_ together? Is there another in all the earth, with\r\nquadruple the advantages of Scotland, who can rank with her in science\r\nand literature, arts and arms? And is England not proud of her poorer\r\nsister? Or can they feel aught but mutual love?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince writing the above, we have looked over some experiments by Messrs\r\nBarlow, Beaufoy, Couch, and others, on the strength of timber. These\r\nshow so much discrepancy of result, as leads us to conclude, {222}\r\nthat experimenters have not attended sufficiently to the structure and\r\nnature of the timber, the position and quality of the different layers,\r\n&c. Take, for example, the stem of a tall tree, 100 years old: At the\r\ncross section, it is found to consist of a certain number of layers of\r\nmatured timber, and of sap timber. These layers having been gradually\r\nformed, the external, after those more internal have partly dried,\r\nand the internal and matured wood being also filled up to more solid\r\nconsistency than the external, the stem, on being barked, contracts in\r\ndrying much more externally than internally. As soon as the surface\r\nhas dried, the outer layers contracting laterally are not sufficient\r\nto surround the undried internal layers, thence split in longitudinal\r\nrifts; and as the drying proceeds inwards, the cracks deepen till they\r\nreach nearly to the heart—these rifts, when the timber is thoroughly\r\ndry, being generally wider in the sap timber than in the matured, more\r\nthan in the proportion of the size of the respective circles. This\r\neffect of drying is what every body is acquainted with.\r\n\r\nBesides lateral contraction, there is also a disposition to contract\r\nlongitudinally by drying, much greater in the external than internal\r\nlayers. While the tree is undivided, this greater contraction of the\r\n{223} exterior layers is prevented, by the adhesion to the drier more\r\nfilled up central column (which probably had contracted a little during\r\nthe formation of the exterior sap-wood layers), the contractile force\r\nof the exterior balancing equally around this central column. Should\r\nthis balance be destroyed by the stem being cleft up the middle, the\r\nlongitudinal contraction will immediately take place, and the two\r\nhalves will bend outward, from the outside layers contracting more than\r\nthe inside layers. We have seen an ash tree rend up the middle from the\r\ncross section above the bulb, nearly to the top, on being cut across in\r\nfelling, owing to the longitudinal contractile force of the exterior\r\nexisting even before drying.\r\n\r\nShould the dried stem of a tree, of considerable length, be laid\r\nhollow, supported at each end, the outside layer being stretched\r\nalmost to breaking by the longitudinal contraction being greatest\r\nin the outermost part, a very small weight, aided by a slight jerk\r\nor concussion, may be sufficient to burst the outside layer on the\r\nlower side, the outside layers on the upper side not standing out as\r\na support above, but combining their contractile force with gravity\r\nto rend the lower. As the outer layer gives way, the strain is thrown\r\nconcentrated upon the next outermost, which also gives way, and the\r\nbeam is broken {224} across in detail. In like manner, when the\r\ndirect longitudinal strength is tested, the external circles being\r\nin greater tension than the internal, the tightest parts of the log\r\nwill give way in succession, like a rope with strands of different\r\ndegrees of tightness; yet the lateral adhesion of the layers will have\r\nconsiderable effect in strengthening the mass.\r\n\r\nThe above explains the fallacy of estimating the longitudinal strength\r\nof a thick piece of timber from experiments with small shreds; it\r\nlikewise explains how a large unbuilt mast is so easily sprung;\r\nwherefore a beam round as grown will be rendered stronger as a beam by\r\nbeing formed into a hollow cylinder, by boring out the central part;\r\nand also how a square log will be strengthened as a beam, by cleaving\r\nit up the middle, and placing the two pieces on edge, with their\r\noutside or backs together. In the latter case, the middle, by being\r\nturned outside, and exposed to the air, will contract more than what\r\nit would do shut up and covered by the exterior wood, especially if\r\nresinous pine timber, which continues to contract for many years, owing\r\nto the resin, when exposed to the air, gradually drying or undergoing\r\nsome change, by which it is diminished in size, and rendered similar to\r\namber. {225}\r\n\r\nConsideration of the difference of tension of the concentric layers,\r\nfrom the difference of disposition to contract by drying, modified\r\nby the difference of position in which these layers may stand, when\r\nsupporting weights and bearing strain, with the various qualities of\r\ntimber of the same kind of tree, from variety, age, soil, climate, or\r\nfrom being taken from near the outside or heart, or butt or top, will,\r\nwe think, account for the contrariety of results which unphilosophical\r\nexperiments have afforded.\r\n\r\n\r\n{226} VI.—STEWARDS PLANTER’S GUIDE, AND SIR WALTER SCOTT’S CRITIQUE.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed that a sensation has been produced in a certain\r\nquarter, particularly among persons of a certain age, by a publication\r\nof Sir Henry Steuart of Allanton, on removing large trees, eked out by\r\na very clever article in the London Quarterly, on Landscape Gardening,\r\nascribed to Sir Walter Scott.\r\n\r\nIt may seem unnecessary to direct the attention of the public again\r\neither to this volume or its subject, both of which have already\r\nengaged the public attention to a degree greatly beyond their value\r\nand importance; but Sir Henry, with all his foppery and parade of\r\ndecorating parks, approaches, and lawns, and all that sort of chateau\r\nmillinery, has now and then risen above his subject, and not only given\r\nus several hints useful in rural economy, but has also pretensions to\r\nhave brought out some facts hitherto but imperfectly known, and to have\r\ntraced them to general principles. {227}\r\n\r\nIt is curious to remark of how much greater importance the elder part\r\nof society—those upon whom wealth has at length devolved, are generally\r\nheld. Any device, however trifling, which can in any way divert the\r\nfancy, pamper the lingering senses, or patch up the body of our second\r\nchildhood, is infinitely more useful to the discoverer, and meets with\r\nhigher patronage and more eclat, than what is of a thousand times more\r\nconsequence to the young. Now, if this were the fruit of filial love,\r\nall would be very well—we would idolize the picture: but when we see\r\nthese discoveries only patronized by the old themselves, in the merest\r\negotism, we blush for our patriarchs, and wonder if time and suffering\r\nwill be spent as unprofitably upon ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe wonder much what fascination can exist to a mind of so much ability\r\nand culture as that of Sir Henry Steuart, in decorating a few dull\r\nunprofitable acres,—causing a few bushes and bush-like trees to change\r\nplace from one side of a dull green to the other!—laying digested\r\nplans of action, embracing a great number of years, to accomplish\r\nthis very important feat, which most probably the next heir will make\r\n_the business of his life_ to undo, by turning them back to their\r\nold quarters, if he does not, with more wisdom, grub them out {228}\r\naltogether as cumberers of the soil! For ourselves, we would rather\r\n_baa_ with the silly sheep, and nibble the turf, than pass our time in\r\nacting over this most pitiful trifling, or in publishing a memorial\r\nof our shame. We know not how others are affected, but there is no\r\nother place on earth where we have felt such oppression and weariness,\r\nas in the extensive smoothed park and lawns around the country seat.\r\nWe sicken under the uniformity of the heavy-looking round-headed\r\ntrees,—the dulness of the flat fat pasture, undecorated by a single\r\nweed,—the quiet stupid physiognomy of the cattle,—the officiousness of\r\nthe sleek orderly menial. It may be we are very destitute of taste in\r\nthis; here every thing is experiencing satiety of sensual enjoyment, is\r\nfull to repletion; every thing has been sedulously arranged to please,\r\nand we ought certainly to admire; but we have no sympathy with such a\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nThe solitariness, the absence of men and of human interest, is not\r\ncompensated by any of the wild charms of nature. There is small room\r\nhere for the discovery of the _habitat_ and native character of plants,\r\nno chance of meeting with a rare species, every thing is modelled\r\nto art. The land-bailiff is an adept. With his dirty composts and\r\ntop-dressings, he smothers the _fog_ and the daisy; the scythe {229}\r\nsweeps down every idle weed, every wild flower which escapes his\r\nlarge-mouthed oxen. The live smooth bark of the lush fast-growing\r\ntrees, affords no footing for the various and beautiful tribes of\r\nmosses and lichens. The fog-bee has lost its dwelling, the humble-bee\r\nits flowers, and they have flown away. Scarce an insect remains, except\r\nthe swollen earth-worm, the obscene beetle, and the bloated toad,\r\ncrawling among the rank grass. There is a heavy dankness in the air\r\nitself. The nervous fluid stagnates under it,—the muscles relax into\r\nlassitude,—inexpressible depression sinks upon the heart.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the relief we feel when we emerge again\r\ninto varied nature beyond the ring-fence,—we have the hill and the\r\nfurze, the wild-violet and the thyme, and all the sweet diversity of\r\nour subalpine flora. We have the thatched, patched hut, the fine ragged\r\nchildren, the blooming cottage-girl,—we have the corn-field, where\r\nweeds of every dye, the beautiful centaurea and scabiosa, the elegant\r\nfumaria, the gaudy cock-rose, and the splendid chrysanthemum, are\r\ncontending for existence with the cerealeæ. Look at the broken mound,\r\nwith its old picturesque trees and tangled bushes; there is the ancient\r\nroot where the throstle had its nestlings, which are now at large on\r\nthe leafy boughs, and are {230} tuning their yet unformed notes to\r\nmelody. Now every twig has raised its new column of foliage to the sun;\r\nand branch, and root, and stone, embellished all over in the richest\r\nvariety of cryptogamic beauty, swarm of insect life. This smooth path\r\nhas been paved by the lightsome foot; how superior to the gravel-walk\r\non which the labourer has grudged his useless toil! Even the cart-ruts\r\npossess an interest, which useful labour has worn. After the smooth\r\nmonotony of the park; the turf-dykes, the fluting of the ridges, the\r\ndifferent kinds of crops, are most agreeable diversity. The dunghil,\r\nand chanticleer among his dames, the toiled horse, the lean milch-cow,\r\nand the superhumanly-sagacious-looking shepherd-colley,—every thing we\r\nbehold commands a sympathy, draws forth a wish of benevolence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Sir Walter Scott’s Critique came under our notice prior to Sir\r\nHenry’s Guide, we shall proceed in the same order.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of this article, Sir Walter gives the history, and\r\ndescribes the varied character, of Landscape Gardening, in a very\r\nimaginative and felicitous manner, which, as depending on genius and\r\nliterature alone, was to be expected; but, in the latter part of the\r\nessay, when he comes to treat of {231} action and facts, and Sir\r\nHenry’s _discoveries_, the deficiency in practical knowledge and\r\njudgment, only forms a contrast to the fancy, elegance, and erudition\r\nof what goes before.\r\n\r\nSir Walter, apparently not quite unconscious of the ridicule attaching\r\nto the subject,—to this mighty scientific and historic parade in\r\nteaching country gentlemen to amuse themselves by transferring grown\r\ntrees as they list, from one place to another, without entirely\r\ndestroying the life of the transported subject,—makes a curious effort\r\nto sustain its consequence, by pointing out the immense advantages to a\r\ndistrict by the squire’s residing in it; insinuating, that every thing\r\nwhich may amuse him at home, and thus induce him to stay, although\r\nof itself childish or infamous, becomes of the highest importance,\r\nbeing ennobled by the end. The following courtly quotation is from Sir\r\nWalter’s proemial observations: “A celebrated politician used to say,\r\nhe would willingly bring in a bill to make poaching felony, another\r\nto encourage the breed of foxes, and a third to revive the decayed\r\namusements of cock-fighting and bull-baiting; that he would make, in\r\nshort, any sacrifice to the humours and prejudices of the country\r\ngentlemen, in their most extravagant form, providing only he could\r\nprevail on them to dwell in their {232} own houses, be the patrons of\r\ntheir own tenantry, and the fathers of their own children.” Sir Walter\r\ndoes not attempt to describe or analyze the “humours and prejudices”\r\nnecessary to render the above lures efficacious. Does he infer that\r\nsuch dishonourable power over their fellow men, or that the opportunity\r\nof indulging in such low despicable practices, would induce the country\r\ngentlemen to sojourn in their father-land? It is impossible to say\r\nany thing more insultingly cutting. But we are far from imputing to\r\nSir Walter any intentional offence. Yet we cannot help being angry\r\nwith the freakish favouritism of Fortune, although we are sensible it\r\nbelongs instinctively to the female character, often a necessary and\r\nvery interesting trait; how she dooms one man from his childhood to\r\ntoil incessantly for a bare subsistence; how she lavishes her favours\r\nupon another, and surrounds him from the cradle with every delight;\r\nthe mind enlightened, the taste cultivated, the body trained to the\r\nmost graceful exercises, _even whose very amusements_ are considered\r\nof so great importance as to throw a high interest upon an art of\r\nno earthly utility, but, on the contrary, where the labour of many\r\nworkmen is thrown uselessly away. We are aware that Sir Walter and his\r\nSenator only regard these pastimes {233} of the country gentlemen,\r\nthus highly, through a reflected interest, the latter in a political\r\nview; and the Baronet, from the known warm benevolence of his heart (a\r\nfeeling generally associated with genius), towards his poor countrymen,\r\nto whom he supposes, in the event of the country gentlemen being by\r\nany means induced to stay at home, a part of the great land revenue so\r\nunjustly wrung from the poor man’s labour would again devolve.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to observe with what a flow of imagination Sir Walter\r\nshews off his friend’s inventions—inventions which have been practised\r\nwith less or more success, in a manner very similar, by almost every\r\nplanter of note, since the time of Nero. We quote again: “The existence\r\nof the wonders,—so we may call them,—which Sir Henry Steuart has\r\neffected, being thus supported by the unexceptionable evidence of\r\ncompetent judges (_a deputation by the Highland Society_), what lover\r\nof natural beauty can fail to be interested in his own detailed account\r\nof the mode by which he has been able to make wings for time?”—“But\r\nalthough we have found the system to be at once original, effectual,\r\nand attended with moderate expense, we are not sanguine enough to hope\r\nthat it will at once find {234} general introduction. The application\r\nof steam and gas to the important functions which they at present\r\nperform, was slowly and reluctantly adopted, after they had been\r\nopposed for many years by the prejudices of the public,—earlier or\r\nlater this beautiful and rational system will be brought into general\r\naction, when it will do more to advance the picturesque beauty of the\r\ncountry in five years, than the slow methods hitherto adopted will\r\nin fifty. It is now found we possess the art of changing the face of\r\nnature like the scenes in a theatre, and that we can convert, almost\r\ninstantaneously, a desert to an Eden.”\r\n\r\nNow, this is admirable! Even were it granted, that no planter before\r\nSir Henry Steuart’s time, or without his instructions, had ever removed\r\na tree of considerable size successfully (though we believe he has\r\nnearly as much the merit of discovery in this as in the other curious\r\ninvention ascribed to him by Sir Walter, “making wings for time,” which\r\nmust certainly have been performed by Sir Henry a long while ago, as\r\nwe remember time flying very well when we were a truant boy); yet,\r\nnevertheless, Sir Walter, now that his paroxysm of admiration has had\r\ntime to moderate, will surely help us to laugh {235} at the absurdity\r\nof his hyperbolic figures of comparison, with steam, and gas, and\r\nscenic transformation, which throw such ridicule upon his excellent\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nWe believe that Sir Henry Steuart has been as successful as many others\r\nof his countrymen in transplanting grown trees. We have had some little\r\npractice ourselves in this art, but which, had it not been for Sir\r\nHenry’s _discoveries_, we should not have thought of obtruding on the\r\nnotice of the public. The house we occupied was covered to the south\r\nand west by part of an old orchard of apple and pear trees, which\r\nexcluded the drying south-western breeze, so necessary in a low damp\r\nsituation. We transplanted nearly an acre of these, certainly with\r\nmore success and economy than could have been effected by Sir Henry’s\r\npractice, the soil being so tenacious, that it was impossible to remove\r\nthe earth from the roots without fracturing all the smaller fibres.\r\nThe soil, an adhesive brown _Carse_ clay, contained a good deal of\r\nvegetable matter, to the depth of about 15 inches, when the subsoil,\r\na close hard yellow clay commenced, into which very few of the roots\r\npenetrated. This ground had been long under grass, and the upper soil\r\nwas much bound together by the grass and tree roots. Under these\r\ncircumstances we adopted the following plan:—{236}\r\n\r\nWe first had a stout sledge made, about four feet square, of lumber\r\npieces of wood, the side pieces about five feet long, on which it slid,\r\nhad a small bend, and extended nearly a foot behind the cross bottom\r\nsheaths, which were sparred over with three narrow boards. The stout\r\nchain of a roller was affixed to this sledge, when at use, to drag\r\nit by. In the autumn we prepared the site where we intended placing\r\neach tree, by throwing out the earth on two sides about a foot deep,\r\nand eight feet square, and then dug over the bottom of this shallow\r\npit one spit deep, and sloped the two other sides, to which the earth\r\nhad not been thrown, so that horses could walk across it; we then\r\ntook the opportunity of a slight shower, when the ground was slippery\r\nabove and hard below, so that the sledge could easily be dragged, and\r\nset the labourers to work to dig a narrow trench, two feet deep, and\r\nabout three feet distant from the stem (more or less according to the\r\nsize of the tree), around those trees we intended to remove, paying no\r\nregard to the roots, but cutting them right down where they interfered\r\nwith the trench, and where the roots in the central part (the part\r\nsurrounded by the trench) were not immediately at the surface, paring\r\noff the turf till the roots appeared. This being done, we caused them\r\nto {237} under-dig and scrape out the clay all round, nearly a foot\r\ninward below the roots, and then to introduce two large ladders at one\r\nside as levers to upset the tree, the strong end of the ladders being\r\nput into the trench, and as far underneath the roots as to catch hold\r\nfirmly, the outer side of the trench being the fulcrum on which they\r\nrested to obtain a purchase, the light end sloping upward about 14\r\nfeet high. Two men were then employed upon each ladder; one of them\r\npulled down by a rope attached to the top, while the other guided the\r\nladder, and rocked it a little up and down; and, at the same time,\r\nseveral men hung upon the opposite side of the tree, either by a rope\r\nor the branches, till their united force upset the tree with a large\r\ncake of clay bound together by the roots, five or six feet square, and\r\nperhaps fifteen inches thick, standing up like a wall, similar to what\r\noccurs when spruce or Scots fir are upset by high winds, in shallow\r\nwet-bottomed soil. We then removed the ladders, sloped the outer side\r\nof the trench where they had rested, and pared away the clay from the\r\nupset root, till we thought four horses could drag it, one or two men\r\nin the mean time sitting in the top to prevent the tree righting. After\r\nthis we introduced the sledge, pushing it as far back as possible; if\r\nnecessary, cutting holes to {238} admit the ends of the side-pieces of\r\nthe sledge through the lower edge of the upset root; and if the tree\r\nwere large, placing several wet slippery boards under the sides of the\r\nsledge, that it might be more easily drawn up the acclivity of the\r\nhole. The men hanging or sitting on the top, then let go their hold,\r\nand the tree generally righted itself, standing fair upon the sledge as\r\nit grew; if it did not do this of itself, they assisted its rising by\r\nlifting at the top. The root was then secured firmly upon the sledge\r\nwith ropes, and the horses were attached, who, by pulling stoutly,\r\ndragged the sledge with its load out of the hole up the slope, and away\r\nto the prepared new situation, one man walking at each side, having\r\nhold of a rope attached to the top of the tree to guide and steady it\r\nwhen passing a furrow or other inequality of the road. The horses were\r\nled across the new site, and stopped when the sledge and tree were in\r\nthe pit, about a foot past the berth; the ropes fixing the stool on the\r\nsledge were then untied, and, by pulling backward upon the ropes fixed\r\nto the top, the tree was upset again upon its side from off the sledge,\r\nand the sledge dragged forward. The tree was then allowed or assisted\r\nto right itself again in its proper berth, and friable earth packed\r\nwell around and scattered over the stool, and a little litter spread\r\nover {239} all. The ground was then drained and trenched, excepting\r\nthe part around the tree, which had been stirred in the planting. If\r\nthought necessary, a prop or two were placed to steady the tree during\r\nthe winter, as it might otherwise work a little back and forward with\r\nthe wind while the clay was moist and soft. After the earth had dried\r\nin the spring, the props were removed.\r\n\r\nWhen we look back on the description of this practice, it seems\r\ntedious; but much of the work is done sooner than described. Were it\r\nof sufficient importance, trees might be grown in something like _lazy\r\nbeds_, with water always standing in the dividing trenches, about\r\nfifteen inches lower than the surface, which would procure roots very\r\nmanageable by this practice. We once had a small nursery of oaks so\r\nsituated, and the trees which were removed, when of considerable size,\r\nhad roots uncommonly matted and fibrous, and which carried with them a\r\nlarge mass of soil. These succeeded very well when transplanted, but\r\nwe should consider that plants from a drier poorer soil, with roots\r\nequally fibrous, would be preferable, could they be extracted with as\r\nmuch adhering earth, which, however, could not be accomplished without\r\npreparation and considerable labour. Were it the only consideration to\r\nprocure plants which would best {240} support the transplanting when\r\nof considerable size, this, or the practice of cutting the roots, and\r\nencouraging the rooting by manuring and thickening the earth around\r\nthe stool, would merit attention; but as we have already stated, we\r\nconsider plants with these matted roots not so likely to grow to large\r\ntimber as those with several unchecked large diverging root-leaders.\r\n\r\nBesides the above mentioned part of orchard, we have, by this practice,\r\nremoved successfully (in some cases so much so as that no trace of the\r\nremoval appeared), a considerable number of trees, where they were\r\ngrowing too close, and think it simpler, and much superior to Sir\r\nHenry’s, wherever the stool of the tree can be turned up with a large\r\ncake of earth, as in cases where the greater part of the roots run out\r\nhorizontally near the surface, which always occurs in flat ground, when\r\nthe subsoil is soaking with moisture the greater part of the season.\r\nWhatever risk there may be of the tree not growing when it has been\r\nsubjected to all Sir Henry’s formal and tedious process, assisted\r\nby costly machinery, there is none here, provided it is placed in\r\ndrained trenched ground, as a considerable number of the small fibres\r\non which the suction of moisture for supply of the leaves depends,\r\nremain untouched, with this earth around them, and {241} strike out\r\nimmediately in the new moist soft soil; and there is no laceration\r\nof the main roots, which, by Sir Henry’s plan, cannot altogether be\r\navoided, this laceration being much more pernicious, and likely to\r\noccasion putrescency, than simple cross section[49].\r\n\r\nBy the above sledging practice, we have successfully removed fruit\r\ntrees 2 1/2 feet in circumference, at two feet from the ground,\r\nand have had some 20 feet high, make a new addition to their height\r\nof six inches the first summer, where no shortening of the top had\r\ntaken place. We have also plucked fair loads of fruit, both first\r\nand second season, as large {242} and well matured as any of the\r\nsame kind produced by trees which had not been touched; but it is\r\ngenerally prudent not to allow them to fruit the first two seasons. As\r\nan experiment, we cut most of the branches from the top of two of the\r\ntrees—that is, headed them down, but found these did not grow so well\r\nas those which were only slightly pruned, or not pruned at all.\r\n\r\nPruning at planting should take place in cases where there are long\r\nannual shoots of the preceding season, or much close spray as in old\r\nfruiting-trees; the former should be cut in, to five or six buds in\r\nlength, and the latter ought to be thinned, to an extent, which the\r\nkind of tree, the largeness and safe state of the root, soil, exposure,\r\nand climate, must determine: we request our readers to pay attention to\r\nthis. Pruning the long annual shoots, prevents a too early formation of\r\nleaves, which often occurs in moist cold soil, and which wither before\r\nthe roots begin to strike.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, where we found the earth too friable, and not\r\nsufficiently bound together by the roots, to rise up in a cake, we\r\nfirst prepared the stool for upsetting, and waited for hard frost[50]\r\nto bind {243} the earth and roots into a firm body like a large\r\nmillstone, pouring some water upon it the evening previous to the\r\ncommencement of the frost, that it might become firmer; we then\r\nproceeded with our sledging during the frost if the road was smooth;\r\nand, if rough, we covered over the frozen root with straw to retain\r\nthe frost; and the first day of fresh, when the ground was soft and\r\nslippery above, and hard underneath, we proceeded with our work, taking\r\ncare not to cover up the root with earth till it had thawed. We have\r\nfound (contrary to general opinion), that no injury is sustained by\r\nexposure of the roots of various kinds of trees to frost, or as great\r\ncold as generally occurs at the surface of the ground in this climate.\r\nWe have succeeded equally well with pear-trees, which had lain out on\r\nthe exposed bare crown of a ridge for two months of winter, without\r\nthe smallest quantity of earth adhering to the roots, or protection of\r\nany kind, as with those immediately from the ground where they grew.\r\nWe have even thought that a certain exposure of the roots to cold\r\nincreased their susceptibility to be stimulated to strike quicker by\r\nthe warmth of the ground in spring, and thus the root suction coming to\r\nact sooner than it usually does in transplanted trees without balls,\r\nand nearer the time of the expansion {244} of the leaves; the check\r\noccasioned by the upper vegetation being too forward for the lower, was\r\nnot so great. In some cases a slight degree of withering also appeared\r\nto have a good effect in deterring the development of the buds till the\r\nearth acquired a warmth sufficient for the root striking.\r\n\r\nWe succeeded to our wish with those we transplanted by sledging,\r\nexcepting a few which were placed among young trees obtained from a\r\nsale nursery. These young plants brought along with them a number of\r\nthe eggs of the common green caterpillar. These eggs produced larvæ\r\nupon the young trees the following spring; and these larvæ going down\r\ninto the earth, produced a small grey silvery moth in July. The moths,\r\nfrom the tallest plants being most opposed to them in their flight,\r\nor from being guided by common parasitical instinct to choose the\r\nlargest subjects, deposited their eggs upon the removed old trees in\r\npreference to those on which they had been brought from the nursery,—a\r\npreference which did not seem to arise from any sickliness of the old,\r\nas they were fully as vigorous the first summer after transplanting\r\nas the young. These imported vermin prospering under the propitious\r\ndry warm summer of 1826, rendered several of the old trees as bare of\r\nfoliage the second and third June after {245} removal as they were in\r\nDecember; they have now, however, recovered their vigour, shaken off\r\ntheir parasites, and have produced good loads of fruit.\r\n\r\nWe may be thought fastidious in our tastes, and extravagant in our\r\nwishes, but we desire and expect more of our country gentlemen than\r\nto be mere idlers, or worse than idlers,—practisers of the _Allanton\r\nsystem_. When they turn their attention to forestry, we would have\r\nthem to sow, or to plant from the nursery, and not to disturb and\r\ntorture the fine growing timber which their fathers had located, and\r\nwhich generally suffers irreparable injury from removal,—a system to\r\nwhich Sir Henry Steuart is so absurdly attached, as to recommend its\r\npractice, although only _to turn the lee side of the tree round_ to\r\nthe wind in the same spot. Nor have we much sympathy with Sir Walter\r\nScott’s taste for home-keeping squires,—those Shallows and Slenders\r\nwith whom our great dramatist has made himself so merry. We would have\r\nour landed gentlemen to know that _they_ are the countrymen,—many\r\nof them, perhaps, of the blood of the Raleighs, the Drakes, and the\r\nAnsons. Let them, like our Wellington, our Nelson, our Cochrane,\r\nWilson, Miller, and many others, continue to set before the world some\r\nlittle assurance of British manhood. Let them, like our {246} no less\r\nhonourable Penns, and Baltimore, and Selkirk, lay foundations of future\r\nempires. We would have our young men of fortune go abroad into the\r\nworld as soon as their scholastic education is completed,—not to spend\r\na few idle years in Paris, Rome, or other of the common enervating\r\nhaunts,—they might as well remain in mother’s drawingroom or father’s\r\nstable; but to view man and nature under every appearance. Let them\r\nacquire horsemanship on the Pampas of La Plata; hunt the lion and\r\nthe elephant, and other game, at the Cape, and study the botany and\r\nnatural history of these prolific wilds. Let their ideas shoot while\r\nthey recline under the lone magnificence of the primeval forest, while\r\nthey gallop over the unappropriated desert, free as the Bedouin, or lie\r\ndown composedly to sleep, serenaded by the hyena and jackal’s howl, and\r\nlion’s roar. Let them learn geology and mineralogy on the Andes and\r\nHimalaya, and around every shore where the strata are denuded. Let them\r\nwind about among those abrupt rocks and craggy precipices, where they\r\nmay contemplate the sea-bird’s household economy—the wild herbs of the\r\ncliff—the vegetation and shells and monsters of the ocean—the solitary\r\nwhite sail from distant land—the vestiges of olden time, the exuviæ\r\nof former worlds, in the {247} exposed strata—the abrasion of the\r\nrocky land by the continued battering of the numberless pebbles moved\r\nbackward and forward by the heaving of the ceaseless wave. Let them\r\nstudy the currents, and winds, and meteorology on the ocean, and enjoy\r\nthe sublime feeling of riding over it in its wildest mood. Let them\r\njoin the ranks of freedom in any quarter of the world where freedom is\r\nopposed to tyranny. Let them head the savage horde, and introduce the\r\nmorality and arts of Britain among the ignorant barbarian; or lead out\r\ncolonies of our starved operatives to new lands of high agricultural\r\ncapability, where for centuries no population-preventive checks would\r\nbe necessary. No other employment of life could be so abounding in\r\nheart-stirring emotion, as leading out the enthusiastic emigrants, with\r\ntheir huddled groups of children, whom you know you have rescued from\r\nthe irksome unhealthy toil and wretchedness of the city manufactory;\r\nno occupation could be more delightful than cherishing the new-born\r\nsettlement during the privations and hardships of infancy; in procuring\r\na supply of food, when through mistakes, owing to ignorance of the\r\nclimate and other circumstances, success had not attended their\r\nindustry; and in leading them on to an effective self government. One\r\nwould gladly leave {248} this old world, whose surface is disfigured\r\nall over by man’s patched drilled deformities, and pass on to a new\r\none, where inviolated nature has produced and reared her own children\r\nafter her own fashion, where every plant occupies its own place and\r\nblossoms in its own time. This order must afford intense delight\r\nto the naturalist, independent of the novelty of every thing, from\r\nthe constellation in the sky to the lichen on the stone. In such a\r\nplace, one should feel remorse to suffer the hatchet to work, or the\r\nploughshare to enter in.\r\n\r\nWe fear these amusements (to which indeed, the British seem more\r\ndisposed than any other people), would spoil all relish for the\r\n_Allanton system_, and that our travellers, on their return, would\r\nsuffer the thriving trees planted by their fathers to remain at rest,\r\nand rather incline to introduce into the park some of their hardy\r\nforeign favourites—the iron-wood evergreens of Patagonia, the valuable\r\npines and other trees of New Zealand and Eastern Asia. We believe,\r\nalso, that an acquaintance with the real world, obtained in this\r\nway, would be much better fitted, than the following Sir Walter’s\r\nrecommendation, to render our gentlemen in after life able and ready to\r\ndirect at the nation’s councils, and to improve their estates, and the\r\ncondition of their dependents. {249} Perhaps they would then disdain\r\nto hang on at St Stephen’s, the contemptible retainers (all but in\r\nlivery) of some intriguing member of the cabinet, like hungry jackals\r\n(call-jack), for the pickings their master might leave them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving now looked at the general bearing of our subject, we shall\r\napproach it a little closer, to examine the facts, inductions, and\r\nminutiæ of the practice.\r\n\r\nWhen we first heard of Sir Henry Steuart’s celebrated discoveries\r\nand new system of moving about large live trees, and read Sir Walter\r\nScott’s declaration, that Birnam wood might now in reality come down\r\nliving to Dunsinane, we were disposed to hold Sir Henry a magician,\r\nand were not a little alarmed lest grown up trees might indeed\r\nacquire, under his art, the locomotive power, and gallop about, to\r\nthe no small terror and danger of his Majesty’s subjects; but, on\r\ncloser examination, we find all Sir Henry’s art resolve itself into\r\ntransferring them from one hole into another, by the labour of real men\r\nand horses, without injuring the trees to such a degree as preclude\r\nhope of recovery under proper subsequent attention. His mode of\r\nperforming this may be stated shortly as follows:—\r\n\r\n1st, Procure sturdy subjects, not drawn up tall {250} and delicate\r\nin close plantations, but with short stem balanced all round with\r\nnumerous compact branches, and well and regularly rooted, such as occur\r\nin open situation on level surface. If you have not trees possessing\r\nthese _prerequisites_ ready at hand Go prepare them. Thin out your\r\nyoung woods to double and triple distance, according as you intend\r\nto transfer them to sheltered or exposed situations; cut the roots\r\nof these trees, and trench around them at a few feet distant from\r\nthe bulb, or lay down rich compost mould around them, to encourage\r\nexuberance of rooting, _and in eight or ten years_ you will have fit\r\nsubjects for removal!\r\n\r\n2d, Prepare the site a year previous, by trenching and manuring with\r\ncompost, carefully mixing and blending the whole (the upper and lower\r\nearth of the soil and compost), and adding mould when the soil is\r\nshallow; attending to thicken and mix clay soil with sandy mould, and\r\nsand soil with clayey mould, also guarding against lodgment of water.\r\nRecent farm-yard dung, peat-moss, and quick-lime, when well compounded\r\ntogether, make an excellent compost manure.\r\n\r\n3d, Commence extricating your trees by opening a deep trench at the\r\nextremities of the roots, undermining a little inward, and gradually\r\nsevering the {251} earth from the rootlets, by stirring, scraping, and\r\nshaking with a very light pick, at the same time throwing the separated\r\nearth out of the hole, and working inward with the shovel underneath\r\nthe bared rootlets, till the tree is so far loosened as to be upset\r\nby pulling on a rope fixed near the top, the rootlets, as extricated,\r\nbeing bundled up so as to be as much out of the way of injury as\r\npossible. Now, throw some earth into the hole; re-elevate the tree\r\nupon this earth, and upset it in the contrary direction; continue to\r\nthrow in earth, elevate and upset in the contrary direction, till the\r\nbottom of the root be nearly on a level with the surface of the ground.\r\nProcure a large two wheeled wood-drag, and wheel it backward close to\r\nthe standing tree. Elevate the pole of this drag, and tie it firmly\r\naloft to the stoutest and most convenient part of the top. Make the\r\nbody of the tree near the root fast to the axle, or to a beam raised a\r\nlittle above the axle, a pad intervening between the axle or beam and\r\nbody of the tree, to prevent injury to the bark; then by pulling down\r\nupon the top of the pole, upset the tree upon the drag, balancing as\r\nnear as possible upon the axle. All being now in readiness, attach your\r\nhorses to the reverse end of the drag, where the root is swung, and\r\nhave your plant pulled {252} backward to its new berth, and deposit it\r\ncarefully there, without any top-pruning, having its heaviest branches\r\ntowards the west, that it may the better withstand our prevailing\r\nwinds, taking great care to divide and comb out all the rootlets, and\r\nto pack in the fine prepared mould, so as to separate them nearly in\r\nthe order they formerly occupied. Then _sad_ down the whole by beating\r\nor watering, and mulch over all to exclude the drought.\r\n\r\n4th, Water every two or three days in dry weather, during the early\r\npart of the first summer, and continue for several years to work over\r\nthe surface of the ground by repeated hoeing or otherwise, till the\r\ntree has forgotten her rough treatment, and has become reconciled to\r\nher new quarters.\r\n\r\nNow, this is Sir Henry’s practice. What is there here meriting the name\r\nof discovery? All the world knew long ago, that trees drawn up tall and\r\ndelicate, in sheltered situations, were unfit for an open exposure,\r\nespecially when of considerable size. We have ourselves dug trenches\r\nround trees, and picked the earth from the rootlets with pointed\r\ninstruments, preserving as far as possible every fibre entire. We have\r\noften collected fine mould and composts upon the ground previous to\r\nplanting, and trenched over the soil; we have carefully arranged the\r\n{253} rootlets, and packed in our prepared mould; we have noticed\r\nthat mutilating the top of certain kinds of trees was very pernicious,\r\nparticularly of the beech and the oak; we have invariably turned round\r\nthe heaviest branches to the west; we have mulched and watered the\r\nfirst summer, and have hoed around the plants for years afterwards;\r\nconveyance by a two-wheeled timber-drag has been long in use (we have\r\nemployed the axle and wheels of a common cart); many, before Sir Henry,\r\nhave prepared the roots by previous cutting; what planter of experience\r\nis ignorant of all this? We grant Sir Henry has done all this well;\r\nmuch of it must have occurred to himself, as it has done to us, as it\r\nwill do to any person of ordinary acuteness and observation, but does\r\nthis merit the name of discovery, or comparison with steam and gas?\r\n\r\nWe shall now give some little attention to a subject on which we\r\nconsider Sir Henry’s claim to the rank of philosophic discoverer solely\r\nrests, and which he introduces to our notice certainly with sufficient\r\nprefatory flourish, under the designation of his “new principle,”\r\n“his rational theory,” which he predicts will raise transplanting of\r\ntrees of considerable size to the rank of a useful art, it being thus\r\nfounded on fixed principles. In order to bring the matter fairly {254}\r\nbefore the mind of our readers, we are under the necessity of having\r\nrecourse to a long quotation. We fear our readers will find Sir Henry’s\r\nmetaphysics not very intelligible; but this may well be forgiven, we\r\nare all too guilty of plunging about when we get into deep water, and\r\nsome of us have not always sense enough to swim with the stream.\r\n\r\nWe here introduce a quotation of our author:\r\n\r\n “But while every organic creation tends to full development, that is,\r\n to absolute energy, or perfect life, still we find, that the organs of\r\n which it is composed are each reciprocally dependent on every other,\r\n for the possibility and degree of their peculiar action. At the same\r\n time, as these internal conditions of animated existence are severally\r\n dependent on certain external conditions, which, again, are not always\r\n fully and equally supplied; so it follows, that the life of every\r\n organized being is determined in its amount, and in the direction\r\n of its development, by the outward circumstances of its individual\r\n situation. For this reason, we see that every animal, and every plant,\r\n is dependent for its existence, and also for its perfect existence, on\r\n conditions both internal and external.\r\n\r\n “From this reasoning it may be conceived, how the several parts of\r\n the living whole reciprocally act and react. They are, in fact, cause\r\n and effect {255} mutually; and no one can precede another, either in\r\n the order of nature, or of time. Thus, in an animal, the digestive,\r\n and the absorbent, the sanguineous, the respiratory, and the nervous\r\n systems are at once relative and correlative. In like manner, in a\r\n plant, the same reciprocal proportion is found to hold between the\r\n roots and the stem, the branches and the leaves: Each modifies and\r\n determines the existence of all the others, and is equally affected\r\n by all in its turn. And as their several parts, by means of their\r\n union, constitute the organic whole; and as their functions, by the\r\n same means, realize the complement of life, which the plant or animal\r\n exhibits; it is evident, that every living individual is a necessary\r\n system, in which no one part can be affected, without affecting the\r\n other parts, and throughout which there reigns an intimate sympathy,\r\n and a complete harmony of perfection and imperfection.\r\n\r\n “Further; The external conditions of this internal development of\r\n plants and animals, are Food, Air, and Heat; while Light seems to be a\r\n peculiar condition, indispensably necessary to plants. Where any one\r\n of these conditions is not supplied, the existence of life, whether\r\n animal or vegetable, becomes impossible; where it is insufficiently\r\n supplied, life is {256} proportionally enfeebled or repressed.\r\n But, to limit our consideration to the vegetable kingdom, it may\r\n be observed, that where a loose and deep soil affords an abundant\r\n supply of food, where a genial climate diffuses warmth in an adequate\r\n degree, and where a favourable exposure allows a competent access of\r\n light (for air, being fully and universally given, may be thrown out\r\n of the case); in these circumstances, a plant, if not mechanically\r\n injured, will vigorously exercise its functions, and attain the full\r\n development of its parts, thus realizing the absolute complement\r\n of life, to which it naturally tends. In the same way, when these\r\n conditions are stinted, the luxuriance of the plant is checked, in the\r\n ratio of that restraint, and the deficiency of the supply. Where any\r\n one of the external conditions is partially or inadequately supplied,\r\n the plant appears to make special, and even forced efforts to secure\r\n as much of the beneficial influence as it can, and to accommodate\r\n itself to the exigency of its situation. Thus, where light is admitted\r\n only from a single point, a plant concentrates all its powers, in\r\n stretching towards the direction of the light. Where light is shed all\r\n around, the plant throws out its branches on every side. In conformity\r\n with this principle, we find, that, in the interior of a wood, where\r\n the Trees {257} mutually impede the lateral admission of light, the\r\n tendency of each is upwards; and the consequence of this tendency is,\r\n that the plant is thereby not developed in its natural and perfect\r\n proportions, but is elongated, or drawn up to an undue height. It\r\n displays its ramification chiefly near the top; while the imperfection\r\n of its life is manifested in the whole character of its vegetation. In\r\n open exposures, on the other hand, the tree developes its existence,\r\n in full health and luxuriance. It reaches a height, such as the soil\r\n and situation admit, and sufficient to allow the branches, which are\r\n thrown out on every side, to expand their leaves freely to the sun.\r\n Not being compelled to concentrate its efforts, in securing a scanty\r\n supply of one beneficial influence, all its proportions are absolute\r\n and universal, not relative and particular. In such circumstances,\r\n therefore, it may be considered as in a full and natural state of\r\n perfection.\r\n\r\n “Another condition of vegetable life appears to be an adequate\r\n degree of Heat. Within a certain range of temperature, vegetation\r\n is positively promoted: Below, or above a certain point (the degree\r\n differing in different species of plants), vegetation is positively\r\n checked. To speak only of the latter case, which is briefly expressed\r\n by the term {258} Cold, it is either produced by absolute lowness\r\n of temperature, or, in particular circumstances, by the generation\r\n of cold, through the effect of wind, and consequent evaporation\r\n from a moist surface; for trees, in themselves, have but little\r\n self-generated heat, above the surrounding temperature. Some they\r\n certainly possess, otherwise they would be killed during severe\r\n frosts. Of the above accidents nature can modify the former, by\r\n accommodating different species of plants to different latitudes\r\n and elevations: Against the latter she adopts the plan of affording\r\n suitable protection to the individual. In the interior of woods, where\r\n the free current of air is intercepted, where stillness and serenity\r\n are maintained, and where each tree affords shelter, more or less,\r\n to every other, nature has little need to generate the provisions\r\n necessary to mitigate the injurious effects of evaporation. But, in\r\n open exposures, and in the case of isolated trees, this effect must\r\n be assuaged, and is, in fact, to a certain extent alleviated, by\r\n various provisions or properties, bestowed upon the tree itself. In\r\n the first place, a thicker and closer ramification of the sides and\r\n top is supplied, and a more abundant spray towards the stormy quarter,\r\n thereby furnishing a kind of clothing of leaves, in order to protect\r\n from cold both the {259} ascending and the descending sap-vessels:\r\n And, secondly, a greater induration of the epidermis, and thickness\r\n of the cortical layers of the bark are provided; which, forming a bad\r\n conductor of heat, act as a still more effectual defence to the stem,\r\n by preventing the immediate and powerful application of cold, through\r\n the sudden subtraction of caloric, from the proper vessels of the\r\n inner bark.\r\n\r\n “In this economy, nature only follows the analogy which she displays\r\n in modifying the influence of cold upon the animal kingdom. The\r\n quadrupeds, which are destined to encounter the severity of an Arctic\r\n winter, are provided with thick and shaggy coats, to enable them to\r\n withstand the intensity of the cold; and all the richest furs, which\r\n man employs to supply his natural, or rather his artificial wants,\r\n are always furnished by animals inhabiting the highest latitudes, and\r\n killed during the severest frosts. What is still more illustrative of\r\n the point under consideration is, that the coats of animals, of which\r\n the thin and short hair is familiar to us in the temperate climates,\r\n such as the dog, the fox, and the ox, are all remarkable, under the\r\n polar regions, for their close, lengthened, and almost impenetrable\r\n fibre, as a secure barrier of non-conducting matter, to prevent the\r\n escape of their vital heat. {260}\r\n\r\n “In like manner, in all the other relations, we see Nature especially\r\n accommodating the character of each individual plant, to the\r\n exigencies of its particular situation. In the interior of woods, the\r\n wind can exert a far less mechanical effect on individual trees; and\r\n therefore, while they are _positively_ determined to push upwards\r\n towards the light, they are _negatively_ permitted to do so, by the\r\n removal of any necessity to thicken their trunks, for the sake of\r\n greater strength, and to contract the height of them, in order to\r\n afford the blast a shorter lever against the roots. But, with trees in\r\n an open situation, all this is widely different. There they are freely\r\n exposed to the wind, and the large expansion of their branches, gives\r\n every advantage to the violence of the storm. Nature, accordingly,\r\n bestows greater proportional thickness, and less proportional\r\n elevation on trees, which are isolated, or nearly so; while their\r\n system of root, which, by necessity, is correlatively proportional\r\n to their system of top, affords likewise heavier ballast, and a\r\n stronger anchorage, in order to counteract the greater spread of sail,\r\n displayed in the wider expansion of the branches.\r\n\r\n “Every individual tree is thus a beautiful system of qualities,\r\n specially relative to the place which it holds in creation; of\r\n provisions admirably {261} accommodated to the peculiar circumstances\r\n of its case. Here every thing is necessary; nothing is redundant. In\r\n the words of a great philosopher, who was an accurate observer of\r\n nature, ‘Where the necessity is obviated, the remedy, by consequence,\r\n is withdrawn.’ If these facts and reasonings be correctly stated,\r\n the only rational theory of the removal of large trees consists,\r\n in prospectively maintaining the same harmony between the existing\r\n provisions of the tree, and the exigencies of its new situation, as\r\n had previously subsisted between its relative properties and the\r\n circumstances of its former site.”\r\n\r\n “In considering the characteristics of trees above mentioned, we\r\n should always bear in mind, that every production of nature is an\r\n end to itself, and that every part of it is, at once, end and mean.\r\n Of trees in open exposures we find, that their peculiar properties\r\n contribute, in a remarkable manner, to their health and prosperity.\r\n In the first place, their shortness and greater girth of stem, in\r\n contradistinction to others in the interior of woods, are obviously\r\n intended to give to the former greater strength to resist the winds,\r\n and a shorter lever to act upon the roots; Secondly, their larger\r\n heads, with spreading branches, in consequence of the free access of\r\n light, are formed as plainly for the nourishment, as well as {262}\r\n the balancing of so large a trunk, and also for furnishing a cover to\r\n shield it from the elements; Thirdly, their superior thickness and\r\n induration of bark is, in like manner, bestowed for the protection\r\n of the sap-vessels that lie immediately under it, and which, without\r\n such defence from cold, could not perform their functions; Fourthly,\r\n their greater number and variety of roots are for the double purpose\r\n of nourishment and strength; nourishment to support a mass of such\r\n magnitude, and strength to contend with the fury of the blast.”\r\n\r\n “On the other hand, in the interior of woods, a universal tendency,\r\n for the reasons already stated, is observable in trees, to rise to\r\n the light, to attain greater altitude, to form far smaller heads, and\r\n taller, slenderer, and more elegant stems. Here is found a milder\r\n and more genial climate; in which, by means of the calm generated by\r\n shelter, vegetation is not checked by cold, and, at the same time,\r\n is undisturbed by the external impediment of wind; and nature has no\r\n need, as in the case of exposures, to generate provisions necessary\r\n to mitigate the effect of evaporation, as has been above observed, or\r\n to endue each individual tree with distinct and appropriate means of\r\n defence against the elements.”\r\n\r\n “That, as the four protecting properties, {263} already delineated, as\r\n belonging to trees in open situations, are essential and necessary to\r\n the vigorous development of their existence, so they may be set down\r\n as indispensable prerequisites for those intended for transplantation,\r\n which generally implies increased exposure; and that soil and climate\r\n being equal, such subjects will succeed the best as are endued in the\r\n greatest degree with those prerequisites or properties.”\r\n\r\n “If we adopt this principle, and follow it up with a judicious mode\r\n of execution, it seems evident that the necessity of defacing or\r\n mutilating the fine tops of trees will be entirely superseded. _We\r\n shall obtain at once_, what the art, as hitherto practised, has not\r\n been able to obtain for us, the Immediate and Full effect of Wood,\r\n that is, _Trees complete and perfect in all their parts_, without\r\n the loss of the time required to replace the parts so defaced and\r\n mutilated.”—“And if such a mode of execution be superinduced upon it,\r\n as shall furnish to the tree a competent supply of sap at the critical\r\n period of removal, the art probably may be said to be established on\r\n _fixed principles_.”\r\n\r\n “Wind being, in a great degree, excluded in unthinned plantation, and\r\n evaporation prevented, heat is, by consequence, generated in an undue\r\n degree. {264} In the same way, light is nearly shut out from such\r\n plantations, except from the top, and a disproportionate elongation of\r\n the stem is occasioned _by the efforts which each individual makes to\r\n gain the light_.” P. 191.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, what do we gather from all these _discoveries_ which, in\r\ncontinuation, our author turns round and round, and exhibits to us\r\nunder every combination, with admirable elegance, it must be allowed,\r\nlike the objects in a kaleidoscope?—that trees grown in sheltered\r\nsituation are not suited for exposed situation, because their roots are\r\nproportionally too small, and the stem too long for stability under\r\nthe strain of high winds; their exterior bark or epidermis, dead and\r\nliving, too thin to afford protection to the sap-vessels from cold,\r\nthe effect of evaporation caused by the wind; their spray and leaves\r\ntoo elevated and open to exclude the cold, or wind generating cold,\r\nfrom the stem and branches. That the reverse coexistent conditions of\r\ntrees in open situation—short stout stem, thick bark dead and living,\r\nstrong rooting, close cover of spray and leaves all around, befitting\r\nthe plant to withstand the tempest, and affording shelter to the\r\nsap-vessels of the stem and branches—and these conditions being {265}\r\nwanting when redundant in sheltered situation, show the beautiful\r\nadaptation of means to end, like warm fur of animals in cold countries:\r\nThat trees being formed to grow tall in close situation, is a\r\nbeneficent provision of Providence for accommodating man with straight\r\nlong clean deal and beams: That trees shoot tall in close situation\r\nbecause they strain hard to reach the light: That trees shoot tall in\r\nclose situation from warmth: That shelter and exposure is heat and\r\ncold: That, “to establish any just analogy between the transplanting of\r\nyoung and of old trees is utterly impossible:” That these conditions\r\nof trees being thus explained to mankind, and followed up by judicious\r\nexecution, the thing is reduced to fixed principles, and raised to the\r\nrank of an useful art, and the necessity of defacing, or mutilating,\r\nthe fine tops of trees, when transplanted, entirely superseded.\r\n\r\nWe shall now attempt to weigh some of these assertions and conclusions\r\nof Sir Henry, and to pursue these inquiries a little farther.\r\n\r\nIt is known to every forester, that trees growing in close order,\r\nand drawn up tall, will not continue healthy on being thinned out to\r\nvery open arrangement, but will often fall victims to the change of\r\ncircumstances, even though they withstand the gale. Who, then, would\r\nbe guilty of the folly of expecting {266} they would bear exposure\r\nand the injuries of transplanting at the same time? Sir Henry Steuart\r\nmentions some particular facts as causes of this unsuitableness.\r\nPerhaps it would have been as well to ascribe it to general inaptitude\r\nand delicacy, as there are several other circumstances not easily\r\nunderstood, such as vital stamina, habitude or acclimatizing, and\r\ntexture and configuration of vessels, which must have influence. We\r\nshould also think simple evaporation of the fluids of the transplanted\r\ntree a much greater cause of its failure than the cold of this or\r\nof any other evaporation acting to numb the sap-vessels in the stem\r\nand branches. The absorbing mouths of the rootlets, excepting in the\r\ncase of very large balls, are generally destroyed by the operation\r\nof removal; and the development of the leaves to a certain extent\r\ntaking place before any new process of striking of the roots, owing\r\nto the atmosphere and branches getting sooner heated in spring than\r\nthe ground and roots, the half-developed leaves shrivel up in the\r\narid spring air, from the evaporation of the juices and deficiency\r\nof root-suction; and when the air gets moist, showers fall, and the\r\nearth becomes warm enough for the _striking_ of the roots, the vital\r\nprinciple is too far spent, or the material substance too much changed,\r\nfor the {267} recommencement of organic action. We have found that\r\ntrees which had remained months out of ground, and were planted in\r\nMarch, succeed better than trees removed immediately from their old\r\nsite to their new, both being planted with equal care in the same\r\nground at the same time. The latter acquired half developed leaves\r\nearly in April, which withered from deficiency of root-suction; and it\r\nwas only with attention that we succeeded in causing them to bud forth\r\nanew and acquire leaves about midsummer; in several, we stimulated the\r\nroot-suction by application of heated water, covering up with litter\r\nto retain the heat. The former were several weeks more backward in\r\nleafing, and when the buds burst, the ground had become warm enough\r\nfor _root-striking_, and the vegetation proceeded without check. Sir\r\nHenry will say, that the check sustained by those which leafed early,\r\nwas owing to the numbing effect of the cold spring wind, and of the\r\ncold of evaporation on the sap-vessels of the stem; but we had caused\r\nseveral of them to be wrapped round the stem with soft straw-ropes,\r\nand this did not prevent the shrivelling of the leaves, although it\r\ncertainly protected the sap-vessels from the cold. This withering of\r\nthe leaves of transplanted trees, by which large transplanted trees so\r\n{268} frequently perish, is most prevalent in cold damp soils, when\r\nthe air is dry and the sun powerful, and evidently results from the\r\nsuperior vegetation being in advance of the inferior; torpor of the\r\nroots, not torpor of the sap-vessels of the stem from cold. It is also\r\nperfectly evident, that trees with long naked stems will suffer most,\r\nas their leaves are raised higher, more in the current of the drying\r\nwind; their root and top farther asunder, therefore less liable to\r\ncontemporaneous impulse; the sap-vessels of the stem longer and more\r\nattenuated, therefore the streams of fluids from the soil, not only\r\nsmaller, but also more liable to obstruction, or to flow slowly, from\r\nthe insufficiency of the vital impulse, or of endosmose in the wounded\r\nsickly plant to impel to such a height. Our author’s assertion, that\r\nthe rough epidermis generally covering the live bark of trees in open\r\nsituations, is necessary to the health of the tree, in protecting the\r\nsap-vessels from cold, is, we think, not quite correct. Some time ago\r\nwe caused the dead epidermis be hewn down from several trees, in a\r\nrather exposed situation. This was done with considerable nicety, and\r\nextending up along the branches. We remember of one case, of very thick\r\nindurated epidermis, where a carpenter was employed more than a day\r\nin laying bare the live bark of one tree. {269} Instead of suffering\r\ninjury by this exposure of the sap-vessels to cold, the trees rather\r\nacquired new vigour from the operation; and the particular tree alluded\r\nto, was unusually luxuriant the season following this flaying, which\r\nwas performed in winter. Now, to apply Sir Henry’s analogy of fur of\r\nanimals, would an arctic fox have been benefited by exposure to the\r\nwinter’s cold in like plight? We also think Sir Henry will find the\r\ntrees of dry climates have a much thicker coating of dead bark than in\r\ncold countries, evidently a consequence of desiccation[51], and, if Sir\r\nHenry must have animal analogy—similar to the desiccation and cracking\r\nof the skin of man in arid air. {270}\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of considerable difficulty to explain the cause of\r\nslender lengthened shoots in sheltered situations, and short stout\r\nshoots in exposed. Sir Henry solves this “excellently well” in two\r\nways, first, attributing it to shelter and exposure themselves,—“for\r\nshelter is heat, and exposure cold,”—and again, to an instinctive\r\nstraining in the sheltered to reach the light, of which its neighbours\r\ndeprive it every way but from above, and would do so there too if it\r\nfailed to exert itself.\r\n\r\nWe find that vegetables have long spindling shoots, and wide spaces\r\nbetween the leaves or buds, when growing in a damp, still, close\r\natmosphere, especially when the plant is sickly or weak from deficiency\r\nof nourishment, and that this happens equally, whether a trailing\r\nplant being supported aloft throws out depending shoots in opposition\r\nto the current of light; whether a climbing[52] plant runs out\r\nhorizontally along a branch or beam at right angles to the light, or\r\nwhether a self-supported mounting plant rises in direct opposition\r\nto gravity. No doubt, when the light comes from one direction, {271}\r\nsuch as the aperture of a window, the plant shoots forth towards the\r\nlight, possibly in consequence of the leaves inclining themselves to\r\nreceive the ray on their superficies, and thus leading the shoot in\r\nthe direction of the light. But this does not prove any straining or\r\nlengthening of the shoot to approach the light; and we ask, what do\r\ngeneral opinion and Sir Henry found their belief upon, of lengthening\r\ngrowth and straining to approach the light?\r\n\r\nAgain, with regard to heat, we notice that plants, particularly shoots\r\nfrom tubers, left to sprout in cold, damp, confined cellars, throw\r\nout very long stems, with wide spaces between the buds or leaves, and\r\nthat very long shoots always occur in confined damp air—long in the\r\nratio of the dampness and confinement, whatever the degree of heat\r\nmay be, provided it exceed a little the vegetating point. Also on\r\nthe north side of hills, the trees have generally longer stems than\r\non the sun-ward side, although in the former case, they are exposed\r\nto the northern blast, while in the latter they bask in the sun. Has\r\nthe same kind of plant, in lower latitudes, longer spaces between the\r\nleaves than in higher? And if it has not, is the cold, from greater\r\nevaporation, sufficient to balance the superior heat of the climate?\r\n{272}\r\n\r\nThe above facts must lead, we think, to the conclusion, that\r\nevaporation, or non-evaporation, of the fluids, has, directly, a very\r\nconsiderable influence in causing a shorter or longer extension of the\r\nshoot between the buds or leaves, and that the influence of the cold\r\nof this evaporation is at most but of a very secondary character. We\r\nwould compare the extending rudiments and matter of the young scion to\r\nthe slow flowing of a gelatinous fluid. In moist air, the watery part\r\nis slowly evaporated, and the drop extends into a long pendulous form.\r\nIn dry air, the water of solution is quickly evaporated, longitudinal\r\nextension ceases, and the pendant is thicker and shorter. The cold of\r\nevaporation may a little affect the fluidity, but only in a very small\r\ndegree[53].\r\n\r\nThe causes of the elongation of vegetables are, {273} however, not\r\nvery plain. We have noticed, that the deeper the seed is placed in\r\nthe ground, the braird rises the higher above ground, even when the\r\nseeds at the different depths have been equally moist. This might\r\nadmit of explanation, but having already occupied too much space with\r\nthis subject, we shall only remark further, that in close woods, the\r\ntrees elongate, because they are precluded from extending laterally.\r\nThe top buds, from receiving more of the stimulating or nourishing\r\ninfluence of the dew, sun’s rays, fresh unvitiated air, invigorating\r\nmotion of the winds, and perhaps of electricity[54], {274} throw out a\r\ngreater continuation of shoot than the under branches; nearly the whole\r\nnourishment from the soil being on this account drawn up and consumed\r\nby these top shoots, and the lower overshadowed twigs and branches\r\nlanguishing and dying from the absence of these advantages. Besides\r\nthis extension of top shoots, by the greater continuation of leaves,\r\nor links of life, occasioned by the above causes, these shoots, owing\r\nto the moist atmosphere of the wood, also push out into longer spaces\r\nbetween the leaves. However, these top branches do not push sun-ward,\r\nbut merely in opposition to gravity.\r\n\r\nSir Henry states, that “trees certainly possess some heat, otherwise\r\nthey would be killed during severe frosts.” Our belief of the vital\r\nheat of vegetables is placed on a much better foundation than {275}\r\nthis _otherwise_; otherwise our credence would be far from philosophic.\r\nFreezing cold affects many vegetables as well as some of the lower\r\nanimals, only by mechanical injury, in rending the vessels by means of\r\nthe expansion of the contained fluid. Now, if these vessels are not\r\nquite full of fluid, if the fluid be of such a nature as not to congeal\r\ninto greater size, or if the body be small, and the vessels elastic, to\r\nyield to expansion without fracture—the vegetable or animal will often\r\nresume vitality, on being thawed from thorough congelation. We have\r\nrendered potatoes, turnips, and fruits, frost-proof, at least unless\r\nthe frost was intense, by a slight desiccation caused by exposing them\r\na short time to the air after being taken from the ground or tree[55].\r\nIn the cases where fishes and reptiles have been found {276} frozen so\r\nhard as to require a hatchet to dissect them, and reviving on thawing,\r\nit will be found that the fluids were principally oleaginous, which\r\ndo not expand in congealing; and in the case of insects being frozen\r\nin masses during the night, and resuming their liveliness next day in\r\nthe sun, we think, if their fluids have congealed at all, that either\r\nthe vessels must have yielded, being elastic (which might more likely\r\ntake place in a small body, without general fracture and derangement),\r\nor that the fluids had not extended by being congealed; but it is very\r\nprobable, though frozen together in a mass of water and mud, that their\r\nfluids, from being of an acid nature, had resisted the congelation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to trees, we have heard that intense frost often splits\r\nthe trunks of some of our indigenous kinds by congelation[56]; but\r\nthese trees retain vitality, and only suffer from the consequences\r\nwhich may ensue from the fissures. We have seen evergreens, plants\r\nfrom milder climates, and trees which had not thoroughly ripened their\r\n{277} wood (that is, retained the vessels full of moisture), injured\r\nin the extremities, and even killed throughout by cold. But this does\r\nnot prove that these had any vegetable heat, any more than those which\r\nsuffered no injury from the same degree of cold, prove that they had\r\nvegetable heat. The juices of some kinds of plants do not congeal at\r\nthe same point of temperature as others. The vessels of some in winter\r\nare not so much distended with fluids as others; and probably the vital\r\nprinciple of some is less susceptible of injury from cold than others.\r\nThese facts may account for the endurance of intense cold by some kinds\r\nof trees, independent of vegetable heat.\r\n\r\nOur author, speaking of the transplanting of fruit trees, states, that\r\n“any gardener could have predicted the probability of fruit during the\r\nfirst season, together with the certainty during the second of its not\r\ntaking place.” Our gardeners will be moonstruck at having the gift\r\nof prophecy attributed to them, at least to predict in such a way.\r\nWe have thought Sir Henry sufficiently ready to impute ignorance to\r\ngardeners before we came to this remark; but to represent a useful and\r\nintelligent class of men in so ludicrous a light, is certainly using a\r\nvery improper liberty. {278}\r\n\r\nEvery gardener is aware that trees will fruit the first season after\r\ntransplanting, just if they have had the rudiments of the fruit formed\r\nin the bud before transplanting, and should the blossom not be injured\r\nby severe weather. Every gardener is aware, though Sir Henry seems not,\r\nthat all fruit trees, of any size, form these rudiments the season\r\nafter transplanting, and that they invariably fruit the second season,\r\nif the season suit the fruiting of the kind; and every gardener of\r\nany experience is capable, even without Sir Henry’s instructions, of\r\nremoving a fruit tree of considerable size, without injuring it so\r\nseverely as to prevent it fruiting both first and second season, which\r\nit will do, and even mature fine fruit both years, though during the\r\nfirst, under very unfavourable circumstances, it should scarcely be\r\nable to develope leaves 1-5th of the usual size, and though these\r\nleaves wither and drop off long before the summer is ended, while the\r\nfruit remains to ripen on the tree. This is _a direct consequence\r\nof evaporation_. The thin leaves shrivel up in the ardent sun from\r\nevaporation and want of sufficient supply by root-suction; and the\r\nbulbs of the fruit, from their massiveness, contain sufficient moisture\r\nto resist withering till the night, when they drink the dews, and\r\nsuck up some little moisture from the roots, undiminished {279} by\r\nevaporation in the transit, to replenish the daily loss.\r\n\r\nSir Henry remarks, that “no man who knows any thing of wood, will put\r\ndown the oak or the elm on light sand or gravel, as it is only on deep\r\nloam and clay that the oak, in particular, will really thrive and\r\ngrow into timber.” No man who knows _how much a suitable soil for any\r\nkind of plant is under regulation of the moistness or dryness of the\r\natmosphere, and other circumstances_, will refrain from smiling at Sir\r\nHenry’s very superficial acquaintance with his own subject, and at\r\nthe manner he thus again brings forward mankind to testify in support\r\nof his own error. Our author will place the above quotation among the\r\nerrata should he take a ride up Strath-Tay from Birnam to Kenmore.\r\n\r\nAmong other items of expense given by our author, none of which seem\r\nto be overstated, we feel grateful for the information, that compost\r\nmanure of lime, farm-yard dung, and moss, can be obtained, compounded,\r\nfermented, conveyed and applied, at the rate of 6d. and 9d. per single\r\nand double load!\r\n\r\nSir Henry makes good his assertion, that slow grown timber is always\r\nstronger, denser, and more durable than fast grown, by a cloud of\r\nwitnesses,—every forester, gardener, and carpenter of the {280}\r\ncountry, is ready to attest it of course! There are few sublunary\r\nmatters which admit of evidence more conclusive. We quote his account\r\nof this uniform “law of nature.”\r\n\r\n “The same general law operates in a similar way on all woody plants,\r\n but of course less rapidly, owing to the less rapid growth of\r\n trees, from the lowest bush to the oak of the forest. In all these,\r\n the culture of the soil tends to _accelerate vegetation_, and by\r\n consequence to _expand the fibre of the wood_. It necessarily renders\r\n it softer, less solid, and more liable to suffer by the action of the\r\n elements. Let us shortly give a few examples of the uniform effect of\r\n this law of nature.\r\n\r\n “Every forester is aware how greatly easier it is to cut over thorns\r\n or furze that are trained in hedges, than such as grow naturally wild,\r\n and are exempt from culture. Gardeners experience the same thing in\r\n pruning or cutting over fruit trees or shrubs; and, the difference of\r\n the texture of the raspberry in its wild and in its cultivated state,\r\n is as remarkable; for although the stem in the latter state is nearly\r\n double the thickness of that in the former, it is much more easily\r\n cut. On comparing the common crab, the father of our orchards, with\r\n the cultivated {281} apple, the greater softness of the wood of the\r\n latter will be found no less striking to every arboriculturist.\r\n\r\n “Further, the common oak in Italy and Spain, where it grows faster\r\n than in Britain, is ascertained to be of shorter duration in those\r\n countries. In the same way, the oak in the Highland districts of\r\n Scotland or Wales, is of a much harder and closer grain, and therefore\r\n more durable, than what is found in England; though in such mountains\r\n it seldom rises to the fifth part, or less, of the English tree. Every\r\n carpenter in Scotland knows the extraordinary difference between the\r\n durability of Highland oak and oak usually imported from England, for\r\n the spokes of wheels. Every extensive timber-dealer is aware of the\r\n superior hardness of oak raised in Cumberland and Yorkshire, over that\r\n of Monmouthshire and Herefordshire; and such a dealer in selecting\r\n trees in the _same_ woods, in _any_ district, will always give the\r\n preference to oak of slow growth, and found in cold and clayey soils,\r\n and to ash on rocky cliffs, which he knows to be the soils and\r\n climates natural to both. If he take a cubic foot of park-oak, and\r\n another of forest-oak, and weigh the one against the other (or if\r\n he do the like {282} with ash and elm of the same description), the\r\n latter will uniformly turn out the heavier of the two.”\r\n\r\nIt is certainly the case, that luxuriant growth increases the size\r\nof the sap-vessels and cells, but with this increase of size, there\r\nis often a proportional increase of thickness of the sides of these\r\nvessels and cells, and a greater than proportional filling up of dense\r\nmatter, as the alburnum is better ripened in autumn, or as the mature\r\nwood, especially of hard wood in dry situations, ripens more slowly in\r\nthe course of years. There is also in many kinds more of close tissue\r\nand cellular part, in proportion to large sap-vessels, when the tree\r\nis growing vigorously than when it is stunted. (See the facts in our\r\nnotice of Withers, p. 199.) _Thence culture does not necessarily render\r\nthe timber softer, less solid, and more liable to suffer by the action\r\nof the elements._ We are really angry with those smooth-tongued rogues\r\nwho “fool us to the top of our bent.” _Every artificer_ who has worked\r\nslow grown ash of considerable age, that is, when most of the timber\r\nhas been deposited after the tree has been seeding strongly, _assures\r\nus_ that the timber is very inferior, in all respects, to that of\r\nquicker growth. {283}\r\n\r\nWe consider the forester who has observed that thorns or furze trained\r\nin hedges are much easier cut from softness of timber than when growing\r\nin detached bushes, a much better observer than ourselves; and we\r\nwould inquire whether he were certain that the greater efficiency\r\nof his blows was not owing to their being better directed, from the\r\nconveniency of access, owing to the training up, than from the timber\r\nbeing softer? The example of the raspberry we consider very irrelevant,\r\nit being only a semi-herbaceous plant of biennial stem.\r\n\r\nGardeners certainly experience the branches and roots of crab-apple\r\nto be harder than the varieties with thicker bark, larger more downy\r\nleaves, and larger fruit. The largest growing apple varieties, however,\r\nare not the above mentioned mild varieties, but those which have a\r\npretty close approximation to the crab. We have taken slips from some\r\nof the very largest of our pear-trees, and having placed them close\r\nto the ground on young stocks, have found they threw out spines and\r\nrectangular branching similar to crabs. Those most dissimilar to\r\nthe crab have thick annual shoots, without any lateral rectangular\r\nbranching, and very thick bark; they have been gradually bred to this\r\ncondition by repeated sowing, always choosing the seed of those {284}\r\npartaking most of these qualities for resowing, their disposition to\r\nvary to mildness being at the same time influenced in some measure\r\nby culture and abundant moist nourishment; but these mild varieties,\r\nalthough they throw out a strong annual shoot while young, seldom or\r\nnever reach to any considerable size of tree, unless they are nourished\r\nby crab roots, their own roots being soft and fleshy, and incapable of\r\nforaging at much depth or distance. Their branches and twigs as they\r\nget old, are also very soft and friable, covered with a thick bark,\r\nbut the timber of the stem is very little inferior in hardness to crab\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\nWe ask, if even the fact of these unnaturally tender varieties\r\n(obtained by long-continued selection, probably assisted by culture,\r\nsoil and climate, and which, without the cherishing of man, would soon\r\ndisappear), being of rather more porous texture of wood, goes any\r\nlength to prove our author’s assertion? We have paid some attention to\r\nthe fibre of the genus Pyrus, and find that the Siberian crabs have\r\nby far the smallest vessels. Having grafted the large Fulwood upon\r\nthe smallest Red Siberian Crab, or Cherry-apple, the new wood layers\r\nabove the junction swelled to triple the thickness of those below. By\r\ningrafting other kinds upon other {285} stocks, we have found the\r\nreverse to take place, no doubt owing to those with largest vessels\r\nswelling the most, there being the same number of vessels above and\r\nbelow the junction, each corresponding, or being a continuation of the\r\nother[57]. But this small Siberian crab, when ingrafted upon a common\r\ncrab, grew fully as quickly during several years as the Fulwood under\r\nthe same circumstances; and the timber, though of much finer texture,\r\nscarcely exceeded the other in hardness. Sir Henry tells us, that the\r\noak is less durable in Italy and Spain than in England[58]. We tell\r\nSir Henry, that the red-wood pitch-pine from Georgia and the Floridas,\r\non the confines of the torrid zone, is more durable than the red-wood\r\npine from Archangel, on the confines of the frigid zone. But does this\r\nfact {286} regarding the oak of the south of Europe, prove any thing\r\nregarding the oak of England,—that it will always he deteriorated by\r\nculture for several years after planting, or that the quality may not\r\nsuffer as much from slowness of growth as from fastness, or from the\r\nclimate being too cold as from being too warm?\r\n\r\nThe reason why Highland Scots oak spokes are superior to English, is,\r\nbecause the latter are generally split from out the refuse of the\r\ntimber cut for naval purposes,—principally _the branches and tops_ of\r\nlarge trees; whereas, those from the Highlands of Scotland are from\r\n_the root cuts_ of copse. We believe most carpenters of Scotland are\r\naware of this. The oak from the Highlands of Scotland is, however, for\r\nthe most part, of excellent quality, growing generally on _dry gravel\r\nand rock_, not on cold moist _clayey soils_. The hardest we have ever\r\nseen was from a steep, dry gravel bank, of south exposure, in an open\r\nsituation, much exposed to the western breeze. The Highland oak from\r\nthese soils is generally of a greyish colour, and very dense; whereas\r\nthat from moist soils is often reddish-brown, and defective. Should Sir\r\nHenry weigh portions of oak from these soils in a pair of material,\r\nin place of mental scales, we think his conclusions would be {287}\r\nsomewhat different.—The strongest, hardest ash we have seen, was cut\r\nfrom a hard, dry, adhesive clay, of course a young tree.\r\n\r\nSir Henry, speaking of the Western Highlands and Islands of Scotland,\r\nstates that “it is from a want of soil, and not of climate, that woods\r\nof any given extent cannot be got up in these unsheltered, but romantic\r\nsituations.” Of many situations of these bleak districts, this must\r\nbe admitted, but we cannot receive it as a general fact; and even\r\nwhere it holds true, the want of (proper) soil, or formation of peat,\r\nis a _consequence_ of the want of climate, although _this_ may have\r\nreacted to increase the evil. There must have been a greater warmth of\r\nclimate, at least in summer, when the forests grew, which lie buried\r\nin the mosses of the northern part of Scotland, and of the Orkney and\r\nShetland Islands, as some kinds of timber are found in situations\r\nwhere such kinds, by no circumstances of gradual shelter under the\r\npresent climate, could have grown. There are several indications of\r\na greater warmth having been general throughout Britain, and even\r\nfarther eastward, and that a slight refrigeration is still in progress.\r\nWe instance the once numerous vineyards of England,—the vestiges of\r\naration so numerous upon many of our hills, where it would now be\r\nconsidered fruitless to attempt raising grain, even {288} with the\r\nassistance of modern science; and the report that the Caspian is\r\ngradually overflowing her shores, a probable consequence of diminished\r\nevaporation from decrease of heat.\r\n\r\nThat this is not wholly owing to the moisture and cold consequent to\r\nthe moss formation, or to any cover or want of cover to the earth, of\r\ntimber, or of any other plants which might possibly have effect upon\r\nthe temperature by shade, evolution of vegetable heat, electric or\r\nmeteoric agency, we think proved, should the asserted fact be correct,\r\nthat, in the small _oes_ of Shetland, (so distant from any considerable\r\nportion of land as not to be under these influences, and so small, that\r\nthe climate must be solely dependant upon the sea), timber is found\r\nin the morasses, although the climate will not now admit of timber\r\ngrowing, being apparently equally deteriorated as that of the Mainland.\r\nIt is not improbable that the superior former climate of the North of\r\nScotland and Islands was owing to their having formed, at one time, an\r\nextensive country, perhaps joined to the continent, and thus partaking\r\nof the continental climate, that is, having a colder winter and\r\nwarmer summer, capable of producing considerable vigour of arboreous\r\nvegetation, and not so favourable to the generating of that fixed\r\nvegetable incubus, peat-moss, who has crept over, and folded {289}\r\nin her chill embrace, the once fair districts of northern Scotland.\r\nThe fogs and more steady low temperature of insular situation, which\r\nnow prevail, not only induce that chemical change in dead and dying\r\nvegetables which forms peat-moss, and preserves this moss from decay,\r\nbut also being too cool for the vegetation of the gramineæ, &c. tend\r\nonly to promote the general spread of sphagni and other moss-generating\r\nplants, which, again, are almost the only plants that can vegetate on\r\nacrid moss-flow, as they draw little or nothing from below, and are\r\nnourished directly by the moisture and other fluids of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOur eastern shore affords sufficient proof that the ocean has both\r\nreceded and advanced recently—at least recently in comparison with\r\nthe great changes which have occurred to modify the surface of the\r\nearth. In proof of this recession, we have the upper _carses_, or\r\ndeltas, visible in every firth or creek where a river falls into the\r\nGerman Sea. These carses, on the firths in Ross-shire, at Dun near\r\nMontrose, around the upper end of the Firths of Tay and Forth, are all\r\nof nearly equal level, about 20 feet above the highest stream-tides.\r\nThe gravel bar at Montrose is considerably above the present sea-level.\r\nA number of caves exist on this {290} eastern coast, evidently worn\r\ninto the rock by the action of the sea at the height where the waves\r\nhave broken. These caves have nearly one level, corresponding in\r\nheight with that of the carses. There are also many places where the\r\ncoast has been shorn away by the action of the waves, and a shelf of\r\nrocks left extending out some hundred paces. This abrasion, which\r\ntakes place nearly at, or a little above, low water-mark, is effected\r\nby innumerable hard pebbles (the most indurated parts of the rocks\r\nwhich give way being converted into battering material for further\r\nreduction), being upborne and dashed against the rock by the continuous\r\nheaving and lashing of the waves. Wherever any breach commences from\r\nthe feebler opposition of any softer part, the action of the waves and\r\nbattering train proceeds with increased impetus and concentration,\r\nespecially if the breach be wedge-shaped narrowing inward, thence caves\r\nof considerable extent are hallowed out. The rocks thus abraded and\r\nundermined, tumble down and are ground into sand, which is swept by the\r\ntides and motion of the waters into the depths of the ocean, or borne\r\nalong to the upper end of the bays, or to some part of the coast where\r\nmore sluggish lateral tides, and particular motion of the waves leave\r\nit and throw it ashore to be blown up into {291} downs. There are some\r\nformer islands which have been altogether shorn down to this sea-level,\r\nof which the Bell-Rock, extending nearly a mile of shelf, affords a\r\nwell known specimen. In many places of the coast, these shelves accord\r\nwith the superior former level of the sea, and with the floors of the\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the sea having advanced upon the land, there are vestiges\r\nof submerged forests (the stumps of the trees standing erect where\r\nthey grew, at or a little above the present lowest ebb) existing at\r\ndifferent places on the eastern coast, both of England and Scotland,\r\nand these vestiges standing upon a former carse or alluvium of the\r\nrivers, are visible in the same firths with the upper level of carse,\r\nof course generally more to seaward than these higher carses, as\r\ndeposition of rivers occurs at what may be termed deposition point,\r\nthat is where the rivers, from the stemming of the sea-water, begin\r\nto widen—where the firths commence; and the slowness of the motion of\r\nthe water gives time for the subsidence of the floated mud. By reason\r\nof the flux and reflux of the tide into the mouths of rivers, this\r\ndeposition takes place only at or near high water, that is, when the\r\nstrength of the inward tide-flux ceases, and before that of the reflux\r\nbegins. It is {292} most abundant at the windward shore, or where\r\nthere is least surf, and among the tall gramina and other vegetation\r\nwhere there is least undulation and current; the deposition which\r\noccurs at this time, some distance below high water level, is floated\r\naway by the current of the following flux and reflux, unless some\r\nobject afford a nucleus of formation. Hence deltas or carses usually\r\nform near the shore of firths, generally soon rise to high-water level,\r\nand have often steep, or even abrupt, banks, collecting at one place,\r\nand giving way before the waves and undermining current at another.\r\nThere is a deposition of another kind than river diluvium, which also\r\ntakes place at the bottom, or further end, of bays and firths, and is\r\nsometimes mixed with the preceding: This consists, as mentioned above,\r\nof the abrasion of the rocks, or shores of the bay and neighbouring\r\ncoast, and also of molluscous exuviæ, borne along by the motion of the\r\nwaters; but this is generally rather an accumulation than a deposition,\r\noccurring in greatest quantity where a heavy swell rolls dead in.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have pretty accurate proof that the present elevation of\r\nthe German Sea has remained nearly steady for several hundred years,\r\nyet our new formation of carse, at the present high-water level, {293}\r\nbears a small proportion to the extent of the upper carse; from which\r\nmay be inferred, either that the sea has remained a shorter time at the\r\npresent level, or that some general cause has more recently operated\r\nto diminish the deposition, such as inferiority of present climate not\r\nproducing so much littoral vegetation,—tides or higher winds preventing\r\nsubsidence by greater undulation or current, till the diffused mud\r\nbe carried out to sea[59]. The junction of the higher and present\r\nsea-level carses, abrupt and always definite, that is, not gradually\r\ndeclining from the one to the other, would seem to indicate a quick\r\nsubsiding of the sea, or rising of the land, such as has been known\r\nto result from subterraneous derangement. The very accurate level of\r\nthese carses proves, that this portion of the world has remained a very\r\nlong time pretty free from these disturbances, recently so prevalent\r\nin some other quarters; and if the change of sea-level has been owing\r\nto such disturbance, it follows, from the extent and regularity of\r\nthe upheaving or subsidence, that the cause must have been very deep\r\nseated, or of great magnitude.\r\n\r\nWe begin to think, from our disposition to ramble from the Allanton\r\nsystem, that we tire of Sir {294} Henry; and we believe, should\r\n_he_ follow us thus far, that he will be tired of us. On looking\r\nback on what we have written, we are almost disposed to accuse\r\nourselves of being splenetic; but the truth is, we regard the whole\r\nart as very unimportant, if not positively pernicious, at least in\r\nthe way in which it has been exemplified by Sir Henry, as a throwing\r\naway of valuable labour to no purpose, if it ought not indeed to be\r\nconsidered as a mere pander to luxury and caprice. We have no sympathy\r\nwith the aristocratical object of the book, and as little with the\r\naristocratical tone in which it has been bepraised by Sir Walter\r\nScott. We should also have no greater pleasure in the discovery of a\r\nroyal road to virtue than we should have to the discovery of one to\r\nscience,—the four cardinal virtues being, as every body knows, writing\r\nbooks, building houses, and raising trees and children, but we should\r\nhope, neither by proxy, nor by the _Allanton System_. While, however,\r\nwe thus state our opinions with freedom, we do not hesitate to add,\r\nthat Sir Henry’s volume has afforded us more information, or, at least,\r\nmore materials for reflection, than any other of the works which we\r\nhave brought under the notice of our readers. {295}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall finish our remarks on Sir Henry’s work, by making some\r\nobservations upon a quotation made by Sir Henry Steuart, from “A\r\nTreatise on the Forming and Improving of Country Residences,” by the\r\nAuthor of the Encyclopædia of Gardening, &c.—an author, who combines\r\ntalent, successful industry, and enlightened benevolence, in no common\r\ndegree. We are sorry to appear before this author, whom we have long\r\nesteemed, in opposition; yet we regret the less, as we consider him one\r\nof the few who prefer accuracy and truth to an old opinion, and whose\r\nname stands too high to be affected by a casual misconception.\r\n\r\n “The general effects of pruning,” says this author, as quoted by Sir\r\n Henry Steuart, “is of a corresponding nature with culture, that is,\r\n to increase the quantity of timber-produce: the particular manner\r\n in which it does this is by directing the greater part of the sap,\r\n which generally spreads itself into side branches, into the principal\r\n stem. This must consequently enlarge the stem in a more than ordinary\r\n degree, by increasing the annual circles of the wood. Now, if the tree\r\n be _in a worse soil and climate than those which are natural to it,\r\n this will be of some advantage_, as the extra increase of {296} timber\r\n will still be of a quality _not inferior_ to what would take place in\r\n its natural state; or, in other words, it will correspond with that\r\n degree of quality and quantity of timber, which the nature and species\r\n of the tree admit of being produced. If the tree be in its natural\r\n state, the annual increase of timber occasioned by pruning, must\r\n necessarily _injure its quality_ in a degree corresponding with the\r\n increased quantity. If the tree be in a better climate and soil than\r\n that which is natural to it, and at the same time the annual increase\r\n of wood be promoted by pruning, it is evident that such wood must be\r\n of _a very different quality_ from that produced in its natural state\r\n (that is _very inferior_).”—“_Whatever tends to increase the wood\r\n in a greater degree than what is natural to the species when in its\r\n natural state, must injure the quality of the timber._ Pruning tends\r\n to increase this in a considerable degree, and therefore it must be\r\n a _pernicious practice_.”—“Mr Knight has shown, in a very striking\r\n manner, that timber is produced, or rather that the alburnum or\r\n sap-wood is rendered ligneous, by the motion of the tree, during the\r\n descent of the tree (or proper) sap. It is also sufficiently known,\r\n that the solid texture of the wood greatly depends upon the quantity\r\n of sap which must necessarily {297} descend, and also on the slowness\r\n of the descent. Now, both these requisites are materially increased\r\n by side-branches, which retain a large quantity of sap, and, by their\r\n junction with the stem, occasion a contraction and twisted direction\r\n of the vessels, which obstructs the progress of the (proper) sap. Of\r\n maple and birch, those trees which have fewest side-branches bleed\r\n more freely than the other, but during a much shorter space of time.\r\n These hints, therefore, afford additional evidence against pruning,\r\n and particularly against pruning fir trees, which, as Mr Knight justly\r\n observes, have larger vessels than the others, and therefore, when in\r\n an improved soil and climate, side-branches for the purposes above\r\n mentioned are essentially necessary to them, if solid, resinous, and\r\n durable timber be the object in view.\r\n\r\n “From the foregoing remarks, I think the following conclusions may be\r\n drawn.\r\n\r\n “First, That trees should be planted as much as possible in soils,\r\n situations, and climates, _analogous to those of their natural\r\n state_; and that it is chiefly in this state, or when there are some\r\n defects relative to it, that pruning or culture can be exercised with\r\n advantage. {298}\r\n\r\n “Secondly, That in proportion to the superiority of the soil, &c. in\r\n which trees are placed, over the natural soil of these trees, in the\r\n same proportion pruning and cultivating the soil ought to be avoided,\r\n and thinning encouraged.\r\n\r\n “Thirdly, That particular regard should be had to the soil and\r\n situation, where either larches, or any other of the pine tribe,\r\n are planted, to remain as the final crop. For as the roots of these\r\n chiefly run along the surface, and as in them the great current\r\n of the sap is chiefly confined to one channel, that is the trunk,\r\n consequently that tribe of trees is peculiarly liable to injury and\r\n change, when subjected to unnatural agency.\r\n\r\n “Fourthly, That the only way in which oak timber of safe quality can\r\n be provided for the British navy, is by enclosing, preserving from\r\n cattle, and properly managing, those royal forests where oak is the\r\n natural produce of the soil. (Alas! there is reason to fear, that on\r\n some future day the neglect of this advice will be regretted). Park\r\n oak is very frequently much inferior to _forest oak_ in durability.”\r\n\r\nWe differ from the author of the Encyclopædia of Gardening here,\r\neven _in limine_, in his {299} assumption, that pruning is of a\r\ncorresponding nature with culture, in increasing the annual circles of\r\nthe wood[60]. Culture, if judiciously executed, increases these annual\r\ncircles; but common pruning up (which, from the general bearing of the\r\nlanguage, we suppose is meant), nine times out of ten diminishes them,\r\nand merely tends to extend the stem in length, by throwing all the new\r\nformation of branches to the top of the tree, in place of partly to the\r\nsides. Thence the tree acquires a slenderer figure, and more delicate\r\nconstitution; and from greater height, and being without cover of\r\nside-branches, loses more by evaporation, and receives less moisture\r\nfrom the ground, which is dried by the breeze passing along under the\r\nbranches; the principal process of vegetation, assimilation by the\r\nleaves, being reduced by the pruning, and carried on at an unnatural\r\nheight, in a colder less genial atmosphere, under a diminished supply\r\nof nourishment from the ground, is consequently less productive of\r\nnew assimilized {300} matter; and this smaller quantity requiring\r\nto be extended along a greater length of stem, the annual rings are\r\nnecessarily thinner.\r\n\r\nWe admit that a tree becomes more _stemmy_ by being repeatedly pruned\r\nup;—we admit, that, on removal of the lower branches, the upper part\r\nof the stem may have, for a few seasons, larger annual circles; but\r\nthe annual circles will be diminished in thickness in a much greater\r\nproportion on the lower part of the stem;—we admit, that the timber,\r\nfrom being deposited in a clean lengthened cylinder, becomes far more\r\nuseful, there being less redundant matter than when scattered out\r\ninto _stemmy_ branches, to which disposition, trees in open situation\r\nsometimes incline, especially if not transplanted very young, but\r\nto which they are nevertheless much more disposed under the common\r\nmode of pruning in an early stage of their growth, than when left to\r\nthemselves;—we admit, that trees, by pruning, raised to lengthened\r\nstem, and thence performing less assimilation, partly compensate for\r\nthis less assimilation, for some time, by making more stem deposit\r\nin proportion to the other deposit, which extends the parts more\r\nimmediately necessary to new formation,—the roots and twigs; but\r\nthe deficiency of productory parts soon {301} reacts to diminish\r\nthe amount of _all_ the new products. In tall trees, this greater\r\ndeposition on the stem, in proportion to that on the roots, twigs, and\r\nleaves, some will think instinctive; some will refer it to an effort of\r\nnature to supply the necessary strength to enable the stem to resist\r\nthe great strain of the winds upon the elevated top. If it take place\r\nto a greater extent than what arises from the greater elongation of\r\nthe necessary vessels of communication, perhaps it is owing to the\r\nevaporation or stagnation of the sap on the tall exposed stem, and\r\nto the considerable motion or waving of the stem by wind promoting\r\ndeposition, evincing one of the deep balancings of material cause\r\nand effect, or circumstantial regulation, which mocks the wisdom of\r\nthe wise. We admit, also, that pruning, in the first place, impedes\r\nformation of flower-buds, and will sometimes thus prevent exhaustion\r\nof trees by seeding, which is so prejudicial both to the quality\r\nand quantity of the new wood deposit; but the consequent greater\r\nlength of stem, greater exposure to evaporation, constriction of\r\nbark, and slenderer connecting tubes between leaf and roots, all tend\r\nsubsequently to promote formation of flower-buds, although the removal\r\nof the lower branches may for a few seasons serve to {302} prevent\r\nthis. We therefore consider pruning, excepting in a very slight degree,\r\nto guide to one leader, and to remove the sickly, lower, moss-covered\r\nbranches a few seasons earlier than they would have dropped off in\r\nthe common course of decay, to be generally preventive of quantity of\r\nwood-deposit, even of common marketable timber, in any considerable\r\nnumber of years, although pruning to a greater degree is often\r\nnecessary where fine clean timber is required.\r\n\r\nOur author’s next implied assumption, that a tree produces best timber\r\nin a soil and climate _natural_ to it (we suppose by this is meant the\r\nsoil and climate where the kind of tree is naturally found growing),\r\nis, we think, at least exceedingly hypothetical; and, judging from our\r\nfacts, incorrect. The natural soil and climate of a tree, is often\r\nvery far from being the soil and climate most suited to its growth,\r\n_and is only the situation where it has greater power of occupancy,\r\nthan any other plant whose germ is present_. The pines do not cover\r\nthe pine barrens of America, because they prefer such soil, or grow\r\nmost luxuriant in such soil; they would thrive much better, that is,\r\ngrow faster, in the natural allotment of the oak and the walnut, _and\r\nalso mature to a better wood in this deeper richer soil_. But the {303}\r\noak and the walnut banish them to inferior soil from greater power\r\nof occupancy in good soil, as the pines, in their turn, banish other\r\nplants from inferior sands—some to still more sterile location, by the\r\nsame means of greater powers of occupancy in these sands. One cause\r\nconsiderably affecting the natural location of certain kinds of plants\r\nis, that only certain soils are suited to the preservation of certain\r\nseeds, throughout the winter or wet season. Thus many plants, different\r\nfrom those which naturally occupy the soil, would feel themselves at\r\nhome, and would beat off intruders, were they once seated. We have had\r\nindubitable proof in this country, that _Scots fir, grown upon good\r\ndeep loam, and strong till_ (what our author would call the natural\r\nsoil of the oak), _is of much better quality, and more resinous, than\r\nfir grown on poor sand_ (what he would call the natural soil of the\r\nScots fir), although of more rapid growth on the loam than on the sand;\r\nand the best Scots fir we have ever seen, of equal age and quickness of\r\ngrowth, is growing upon Carse land (clayey alluvium).\r\n\r\nThe reason that Scots fir is of better quality, and more resinous, on\r\ngood loam and moist till, than on poor siliceous ground, may probably\r\nbe, that the loam contains more oleaginous matter, and other {304}\r\nvegetable products which bear a near relation to resinous, and which,\r\ntransmitted upwards from the roots, may occasion richer assimilated\r\njuices. Men fed upon whale or seal blubber, if the digestion is good,\r\nhave much fatty deposit upon the body, and the perspired fluid is oil.\r\nIt is a fact well known to every intelligent farmer, that _infield_ or\r\n_croft_ land, that is land, which, having been earliest cultivated,\r\nwas, of course, the best soil at first, and which has also been long\r\nhighly manured at the cost of the _outfield_, and therefore containing\r\nmuch oleaginous and other matter, products of organization, produces\r\ngrasses and other vegetables much more nutritive to cattle than the\r\n_outfield_, even though these vegetables be of the same species, and\r\nby reason of more careful culture of those of the _outfield_, also of\r\nthe same size of plant. We have also considered that light, poor sandy\r\nsoil, which throws up a considerable flush of vegetation in the spring,\r\npartly because it has then sufficient moisture, but which almost\r\nentirely gives over producing throughout the latter part of the summer,\r\npartly because the winter’s moisture is exhausted, may throw out the\r\nframe or skeleton of a considerable growth, or annual layer of wood,\r\nin the early part of the season, but may not afford sufficient matter\r\nfor the filling up or {305} maturing the layer into good dense timber\r\nlater in the season, when the assimilated fluid or sap is believed to\r\ndescend.\r\n\r\nOur author states, that the timber of pruned trees must be inferior\r\nto that of trees with many side-branches, because the consequent\r\ncontracting and twisting of the vessels as they pass the junction of\r\nthe branches and stem, obstruct the descent of the sap, thence the\r\ntimber is better matured, and in firs has more of resinous deposit. We\r\nadmit that the resinous deposition is more abundant in knots and in\r\nsome of the parts adjacent; but the timber is not better throughout.\r\nWorm-eating may be observed to commence generally in the neighbourhood\r\nof knots. Although one part of the wood, in consequence of the\r\nobstruction of the knot, be more dense and resinous, another part,\r\nimmediately above or below the knot, where the growths are extended to\r\nfill up the vacant space, where the worming commences, is less dense,\r\nand of inferior durability, and corruption begun, extends. The knotted\r\ntimber, of course, is very inferior in strength and value to the clean.\r\nWe would refer the longer continued flow of sap from maple and birches,\r\nwhich have many side-branches, in part, to the lower or side-branches\r\ncommencing to vegetate sooner in the {306} spring than the top of\r\nthe tree; this successive commencement of vegetation prolonging the\r\nbleeding.\r\n\r\nAgain, in larch, we find that by far the hardest and most durable wood\r\nis grown upon poor, hard, thin tills (that is, thin of vegetable mould\r\nupon the diluvium), even where the root-rot commences about thirty\r\nyears of age. Now, we ask, is this the natural soil of larches? We have\r\nnot, however, found larch from rich loam, of better quality than from\r\npoor sand, as we have observed in Scots fir. We also consider larch,\r\ngrown on a proper larch soil—on sound soil and subsoil, or sound rock,\r\ncommon in acclivous situation—superior in quality to larch of equal\r\nquickness of growth, raised on rich loam or sand, though not equal to\r\nlarch of slow growth from the above mentioned poor tills.\r\n\r\nWe would ask how our author is enabled to assume, as an axiom, that\r\ntrees produce the best timber in their natural locality? We would also\r\ndesire some _rational_ information to shew in what manner pruning\r\nup can in any way conduce generally, to the increase of the timber,\r\nor to the enlargement of one-stemmed vegetables. A tree naturally\r\nrises in one stem. It throws out its branches in the disposition most\r\nfavourable to draw the fullest benefit from the light and air. It of\r\nits own {307} accord (that is when man does not meddle), gradually\r\nraises its pyramidal centre, with proportional lateral spread, as high\r\nas is befitting, for the fullest expansion of the individual, under\r\nthe circumstances of its location. Man may mar this beautiful natural\r\nbalance easier than decypher the proximate cause he may throw the\r\nnew deposit of wood in greater proportion upon the upper part of the\r\nstem, rendering his beam more suitable from equality of thickness,\r\nand particularly in pines, of cleaner, smaller growthed, more durable\r\ntimber, thence more valuable. But the tree will neither produce the\r\nsame quantity of measurable timber in a considerable number of years,\r\nnor will it ultimately reach to nearly the same size, nor continue life\r\nnearly so long, as when left to itself. Man’s interference is useful\r\nin removing competitors, in giving it lateral room for extension,\r\nin _training_ it skilfully to one leader and subordinate equality\r\nof feeders, should transplanting, early pruning up, or other cause,\r\ndestroy the natural regular pyramidal disposition—not in pruning it up,\r\nthus reducing it to narrower compass, and destroying its balance to the\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nThe use of the infinite seedling varieties in the families of plants,\r\neven in those in a state of nature, differing in luxuriance of growth\r\nand local adaptation, {308} seems to be to give one individual (the\r\nstrongest best circumstance-suited) superiority over others of its kind\r\naround, that it may, by overtopping and smothering them, procure room\r\nfor full extension, and thus affording, at the same time, a continual\r\nselection of the strongest, best circumstance-suited, for reproduction.\r\nMan’s interference, by preventing this natural process of selection\r\namong plants, independent of the wider range of circumstances to\r\nwhich he introduces them, has increased the difference in varieties,\r\nparticularly in the more domesticated kinds; and even in man himself,\r\nthe greater uniformity, and more general vigour among savage tribes,\r\nis referrible to nearly similar selecting law—the weaker individual\r\nsinking under the ill treatment of the stronger, or under the common\r\nhardship.\r\n\r\nAs our author’s premises thus appear neither self-evident, nor\r\nsupported by facts, it might seem unfair, at least it would be\r\nsuperfluous, to proceed to the consideration of his conclusions and\r\ncorollaries. {309}\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. CRUICKSHANK’S PRACTICAL PLANTER.\r\n\r\nAfter the preceding parts of this volume had gone to press, we received\r\na copy of Cruickshank’s Practical Planter. We endeavour to give a short\r\nview of the contents.\r\n\r\nThe author commences with some general remarks on the expediency and\r\nprofit of laying uncultivated ground under timber, stating, rather too\r\nstrongly, the very superior income derivable from forest than from\r\nheathy moors, and its advantages to the soil. No doubt, a great portion\r\nof the higher and more rocky part of Scotland is susceptible of little\r\nother improvement than planting; and, under timber, would produce more\r\nthan ten times the income that it does in pasture; and the patriotic\r\nmotive of embellishing his country, and enriching his countrymen, may\r\nexcuse his having drawn the advantages of planting in rather high\r\ncolours. Mr Cruickshank’s statement (as he says, designedly kept rather\r\nbelow the truth), that an acre of moor, of average quality, covered\r\nwith Scotch fir, sixty years {310} planted, would contain 600 trees,\r\nvalue 10s. each, differs considerably from what has come within our\r\nexperience. The timber of an acre of Scotch fir, sixty years planted in\r\nsuch waste ground as occurs in the valley of the Tay, will not average\r\nmuch more than one hundred pounds per acre on the spot, and laid down\r\non the quay at Newcastle (the place to which the greater part of the\r\nScotch fir on the east of Scotland is carried), would not produce L.\r\n300 per acre.\r\n\r\nIn order the more to encourage planting, Mr Cruickshank runs into a\r\nspeculative statement of the fertilizing influence of planting upon\r\nthe soil, in rather a novel manner, leaving out the particular facts,\r\nwhich, he says, had come under his own observation, and adducing one\r\nas proof, furnished to him by another person unnamed. We have often\r\nhad occasion to see ground, which had produced a crop of firs, brought\r\nunder tillage without any marked fertility beyond the adjacent fields\r\nwhich had been under proper rotation of cropping, certainly inferior\r\nto what had lain for the same length of time in natural grass pasture.\r\nThere is a particular instance in a slight rising ground (diluvial\r\nsoil) in the Carse of Gowrie, where the fields, since the rooting out\r\nof the fir-wood, have not paid seed and labour in corn, though {311}\r\nunder regular manuring and rotation. There are even varieties of pine,\r\nsuch as the loblolly, which are known to have an influence upon the\r\nsoil where they grow poisonous to succeeding crops. Mr Cruickshank\r\nhimself adverts several times to ground which had produced a crop of\r\ntimber, being _boss_ (hollow) from the roots remaining in the soil,\r\nand owing to this hollowness being unsuited for replanting till the\r\nroots were removed or consumed. We do not very well comprehend this\r\nhollowness, and ascribe the unsuitableness for replanting immediately,\r\nrather to exhaustion, or to the formation of something inimical to\r\nvegetation, than to any hollowness or manner of arrangement of the soil.\r\n\r\nAs the causes which promote or retard the formation, or which tend to\r\ndissipate the earth’s covering of vegetable mould—a covering, on the\r\nrichness or thickness of which the fertility of ground, as well for\r\nmost kinds of naval timber as for other products, is so much dependent,\r\nthough of the greatest importance—have never, that we are aware of,\r\nbeen generally brought into view, we shall devote some space to their\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, to give a fair specimen of our author, we shall\r\ntranscribe several pages where he {312} has treated this subject with\r\nsome ingenuity, and on which he appears to have bestowed considerable\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n “Those who have never had an opportunity of seeing old woodlands\r\n brought into cultivation, will scarce credit what has now been\r\n advanced, that the soil should be enriched by the production of wood,\r\n when the experience of ages has proved that it is always exhausted by\r\n other crops.”—“Trees draw their nourishment from a much greater depth\r\n than any of the grasses, roots, or different kinds of grain raised\r\n by the agriculturist. Most of the latter derive the whole of their\r\n subsistence from the part of the soil that lies within a few inches of\r\n the surface; but the former, from the superior strength and magnitude\r\n of their roots, are enabled to penetrate much farther, and extract\r\n food from the very rock which forms the substratum of a great portion,\r\n both of our cultivated and uncultivated grounds. This, though it does\r\n not account for lands being positively enriched by wood, makes it, at\r\n the same time, far less surprizing that trees should grow to a large\r\n size, and yet not exhaust the upper part of the soil in so great a\r\n degree as most of the crops cultivated by the farmer.\r\n\r\n “There is another circumstance which gives ground in wood a great\r\n advantage over that in {313} tillage, which is, that the leaves of\r\n the trees are suffered to decay and rot where they fall, and, by\r\n this means, an annual addition is made to the depth of the vegetable\r\n mould. Now, the leaves of a tree may be considered as bearing the same\r\n proportion to the trunk and branches, in respect to the nourishment\r\n which they require, as the straw of corn bears to the grain. But the\r\n manure which cultivated land receives, is, in general, little more\r\n than the straw which grows on it after it has served for food or\r\n litter to cattle. Ground in wood, then, actually receives, in the\r\n annual fall of the leaves, as much enrichment as the farmer bestows on\r\n his land under tillage.\r\n\r\n “Ground employed in agriculture is exposed at almost every season of\r\n the year to the full action of the atmosphere; and in the drought and\r\n heat of summer, much of its strength is evaporated. In land covered\r\n with wood, the case is entirely different, as from the shade afforded\r\n by the leaves and branches, very little evaporation takes place.\r\n This, then, is another reason that serves in some measure, at least,\r\n to explain the seemingly paradoxical fact in question. For, that\r\n evaporation has a very powerful tendency to exhaust land, by drawing\r\n off and dissipating the more volatile part of the matter which {314}\r\n assists in the process of vegetation, there can be no doubt, when we\r\n consider that any kind of dung may be deprived of the greater part\r\n of its strength by being long exposed to a dry atmosphere. Nor is it\r\n merely by preserving its own original substance that land in wood has\r\n the advantage of cultivated ground. Whatever is extracted from the\r\n latter in the form of vapour, falls again, when condensed, in the\r\n shape of rain or dew; but, instead of descending wholly on the same\r\n spots from whence it rose, it is, of course, diffused over the whole\r\n space which the clouds, containing it, may happen to cover, and woods\r\n and moors have as good a chance of receiving it on its return to the\r\n earth, as the ground in tillage. The part of it which falls, either\r\n on the cultivated fields or the naked wastes, may be again evaporated\r\n before it has time to be productive of any benefit; but the portion\r\n of it which the woodlands imbibe is retained to enrich the soil; for,\r\n the umbrage excluding the rays of the sun, there is no possibility of\r\n its being extracted a second time. Land covered with trees, therefore,\r\n while it never loses any thing, receives, with every fall of rain,\r\n or of dew, a tribute from the riches of the cultivated part of the\r\n country. The advantage derived from this source is greater than\r\n will be credited by those who are not aware how much {315} of the\r\n substances proper for vegetable nutriment are exhaled from the land in\r\n a gaseous state during the dry season of the year.\r\n\r\n “But the principal way in which wood becomes instrumental in enriching\r\n land still remains to be noticed. When trees attain a certain size,\r\n they attract multitudes of birds, which build their nests and seek\r\n shelter among the branches. The dung of these animals is the very\r\n richest kind of manure which can be applied to land, and possesses, at\r\n least, three times the strength of that commonly used in agriculture.\r\n The quantity of it produced during the long series of years which\r\n trees require to reach maturity is, especially where large colonies of\r\n crows take up their abode, very considerable, and must have a powerful\r\n influence in improving and fertilizing the soil.\r\n\r\n “I ought not to omit here to mention, among the causes why ground is\r\n improved by producing wood—the minuteness into which its particles\r\n are divided by the roots and their fibres. On taking up a young tree,\r\n or even a gooseberry bush, and shaking the earth from its roots, we\r\n find the mould that falls from it as completely reduced to powder, as\r\n if it had been passed through a fine sieve. Now, the fact {316} seems\r\n undoubted, that land is much increased in fertility by being brought\r\n to this state.”\r\n\r\nWhether a greater accumulation of vegetable mould or enriching of\r\nthe soil, would take place under a system of rotation of crops,\r\nstirring of the ground, and manuring, or under Nature’s own system\r\nof management—whether, under forest, or under the rich leafy grasses\r\ndepastured by cattle, is a question of the greatest intricacy, and\r\nonly admits of local decision, being dependent upon climate, soil,\r\nand circumstance. From our author’s statements, it would appear that\r\nhis mind had only ranged along the surface of the subject. He has not\r\ntaken into account the quantity of root which herbaceous vegetables\r\nannually leave in the ground—in some kinds little inferior in bulk to\r\nthe portion above ground. We have traced oat and wheat roots running\r\ndown into clay five and six feet (as deep as those of many kinds of\r\ntrees), extremely numerous, and fine as human hair. He seems not aware\r\nthat the bulk of yearly vegetable produce is much increased by culture,\r\nalternate cropping, and extraneous manure, such as lime, mixture of\r\nearths, sea-ware, bones. He has not considered that the annual dead\r\nroots within the soil, and the vegetable and animal manure, and the\r\n{317} sward and the stubble ploughed down, conduce much more to enrich\r\nand thicken the soil than the tree leaves, blown about by the winds,\r\nand nearly dissipated into air, before the residuum fixes as a part\r\nof the soil; and also that ploughing is often beneficial to shallow\r\nsoils, by mixing the thin covering of mould with the pure earth of\r\nthe subsoil,—the vegetable soil-matter, from consequent deeper cover,\r\nand more equable moisture, not losing so much by evaporation, and at\r\nthe same time being more efficacious as nutriment to the vegetation.\r\nHe seems unacquainted with the fact, that the matter of wood and\r\ntree-leaves, especially of the resinous kinds, and those containing\r\nmuch tannin, if not actually pernicious, have very little fertilizing\r\neffect—saw-dust has generally no manuring influence, but turns into\r\npeat. He also appears to be ignorant, that some kinds of vegetables\r\ndraw more from the air and water, and others more from the earth;\r\nand, especially, that vegetables in a moist climate, depastured or\r\ncut before maturity, exhaust the soil much less than when allowed to\r\nseed. In Britain, soils, particularly those of good quality, become\r\nricher, and thicken more under pasturage, than under any other common\r\nvegetation. This is owing to the manuring of the cattle—to the natural\r\ngrasses not being what is termed scourging plants, especially {318}\r\nwhen not allowed to seed—to the complete cover of the ground by the\r\nleaves—to the quantity of root which dies annually—and to the mould\r\nthrown up by the red earth-worm, renovating the surface, and partly\r\ncovering the moss and decayed leaves and old bulbs. It is a curious\r\nfact, that, under pasturage, fertility should increase in Britain and\r\ndiminish in Australia. An uncropt deep cover of grass appears necessary\r\nto shelter the vegetable soil-matter during the arid heat, and even to\r\nprotect the roots from being burned out, in the latter country. And the\r\nmanure of cattle, instead of being covered by the luxuriant herbage\r\nbefore it is desiccated, and enriching the soil as in England, is, in\r\nNew South Wales, under the powerful sun and arid air, quickly reduced\r\nto dust and dissipated.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of soils may also be quickly increased, and the vegetable\r\ncover thickened almost to any extent under tillage, by first rearing\r\na quantity of large growing annual vegetables, and when nearly full\r\nextended, burying this green vegetable produce in drills, resowing the\r\nground immediately with another fast growing kind, and proceeding thus\r\ncontinuedly.\r\n\r\nThe influence of birds in enriching forest soil, is exceedingly\r\nlimited, and is chiefly perceptible, not in continued forest, but in\r\nsome detached portions or {319} clumps of park trees, which colonies\r\nof rooks or other large birds frequent.\r\n\r\nOf the natural grass which Mr Cruickshank states succeeds in woods\r\nto the original heaths, and which he describes as affording such\r\nexcellent tender food for cattle, we can only say, that either the\r\nwoods must have been unprofitably thin, and the trees naked, or that\r\nhe has completely mistaken the quality of the herbage. The grass of\r\nwoods is unhealthy food for cattle, and generally not relished, being\r\nrendered unpalatable and noxious by the resinous and bitter droppings\r\nfrom the tree leaves, and by the bitter and nauseous juices generated\r\nin the soil by the roots of trees, which the herbage roots draw up.\r\nIn dry soils, there is sometimes an accumulation of whitish substance\r\nwithin the ground, around the roots of trees, which some refer to\r\nexcrementitious deposit[61], but which, we think, is rather the produce\r\nof a subterraneous vegetable, of the nature of a fungus or mould.\r\nWherever this has increased to a considerable extent, we believe old\r\nforest ground will be found of great fertility. {320}\r\n\r\nThe friability and minute division of the soil to which Mr\r\nCruickshanks refers, existing around the bulbs of trees, can only be\r\nof utility where the soil is too adhesive. Light soil is often injured\r\nby being cropped by plants which tend greatly to reduce adhesion—what\r\nthe farmer styles being _driven_: besides, all luxuriant annual crops\r\nrender adhesive soils friable; and, remaining for a time under natural\r\ngrass, gives what is termed a turfiness to soils, which continues for\r\nseveral years, and which renders both adhesive and light soils more\r\nproductive, preventing the adhesive from sinking down into mortar\r\nunder cultivation, and the light from losing all adhesion or granular\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThere is, no doubt, a disposition to accumulate vegetable deposit\r\nin forests, from the moistness, coolness of the ground, and shade,\r\nnot tending so much as the sunshine and exposure of open country to\r\ndissipate or volatilize the residuum of the decayed leaves and roots.\r\nIn a lower latitude, beyond the line of peat formation, this will have\r\nsome influence to increase the depth and richness of the vegetable\r\nmould; but, in Scotland, where cold till bottom prevails, more injury\r\nwill result from forest tending to throw the debri of vegetation into\r\ncombinations unfavourable to the nourishment of plants (such as peat\r\n{321} and compounds in which iron forms a part), than advantage, from\r\nthe dead vegetable matter not being so much dissipated by aration and\r\nexposure to the sun. We have often observed the effect of remaining for\r\na length of time in a state of considerable dryness, dissipating the\r\nvegetable part of the soil, in some of the old infield clays, where\r\nthe crown of the large ridges are raised up a foot or two above the\r\noriginal surface-level. At the crown of the ridge, the vegetable clay\r\nmould often only extends down about nine inches from the surface, the\r\nsubsoil immediately under being nearly void of vegetable matter, and\r\nextremely close tenacious clay,—a solid foot of it, though of equal\r\nmoistness, being nearly double the weight of the same bulk of the\r\nvegetable clay mould above it. From this clay, almost purely mineral,\r\nbeing a little above the original surface-level, there can be no doubt,\r\nthat at one time it consisted of the vegetable surface mould of the\r\ncountry, heaped up by repeated ploughings, and that it has gradually\r\nlost the vegetable part. The depth of vegetable soil, near the furrows\r\nof the ridges, is generally found to be greater than at the ridge crown.\r\n\r\nThe same dissipation of vegetable matter takes place when a ditch has\r\nbeen dug in clay ground, and {322} the excavated earth thrown up to\r\nform a dike on one side. On removal of the dike, the original surface,\r\nwhich no doubt, at the time the dike was formed, consisted of vegetable\r\nclay mould similar to the surface around, is always found to be close,\r\nheavy, poor clay, containing little or no carbonaceous or vegetable\r\nmatter. In this case, from the draining effect of the ditch, the\r\noriginal surface under the dike must have been drier than the subsoil\r\nof the crowns of the ridges.\r\n\r\nThe difference of depth and richness of vegetable mould, may nearly\r\nalways be referred to existing causes, such as the original surface\r\n(diluvium, or decayed rock), being a combination of earths favourable\r\nto vegetation; occupying a genial situation; being favourably placed\r\nwith regard to moisture, that is, less or more moist, according as the\r\noriginal surface has been clayey or sandy, or open or close bottomed;\r\nand is in no way connected with those flood torrents to which we owe\r\nthe diluvium deposits themselves—tills, sand and gravel, in which\r\nwe have never found any vegetable matter, excepting in the coaly or\r\nmineralized state.\r\n\r\nUnless in the case of alluvium, or of drift sand, or where surface\r\nearth has been rolled down from {323} heights, or been _forced_ by\r\nman[62], soil is seldom found to exceed 6 feet in depth, and that only\r\nin warm moist situations, propitious to vegetation. In Scotland we\r\nnever have seen it exceed 3 or 4 feet in depth where its accumulation\r\nhad not been aided by the above causes. The most common depth is from\r\n6 inches to 2 feet; but, in many of our sterile districts, the surface\r\nhardly deserves the name of mould, containing very little vegetable\r\nmatter, or that matter being unavailable from the presence of tannin.\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact, that summer-fallowing always dissipates a\r\nportion of the vegetable matter in the soil, although it may, at the\r\nsame time, tend to fertility, especially in adhesive soils, and where\r\nthe climate is not very arid and warm, overbalancing the loss from\r\ndissipation by the advantage resulting from aëration and absorption\r\nof gases and heat, and the sun’s rays; by the mechanical disposition\r\nand comminution from being thoroughly dried and then moistened; and,\r\nprobably, by the formation of salts, {324} stimulative to vegetation;\r\nor, as it has been thought, by the resting for a season. In the case\r\nof any tannin or inert vegetable matter existing in the soil, the\r\nheat and drying will tend to reduce these to a condition suitable for\r\nvegetable food. In the West Indies, when a summer fallowing is resorted\r\nto in order to get clear of the weeds, the fertility of the ground\r\nis considerably lessened, from the evaporation or burning out of the\r\nputrescent or carbonaceous matter. Were the fallowing continued for\r\nseveral successive seasons, there is no doubt that the whole matter,\r\nwhich, combined with earth, forms mould, would be dissipated.\r\n\r\nAbout a century ago, it was the practice, in our neighbourhood (an\r\nalluvial clay district), to build up the soil of the fallow division,\r\nfurrow deep, into thin dikes, or walls, about 5 feet high. This was\r\ndone in early summer. After being dried and aërated by the summer’s\r\ndrought, the dikes were levelled down in the autumn and sown with\r\nwheat. This system was considered so fertilizing as to counterbalance\r\nthe labour and the loss of a crop.\r\n\r\nOur own practice has proven that there is scarcely any manure more\r\neffective for one crop, particularly of spring sowing, than the clay of\r\nold mud walls of {325} houses, though applied in no larger quantity\r\nthan is usually given of farm-yard manure, and though the clay appear\r\nquite free from vegetable matter. It is improbable that the resting\r\nof the clay from production could have any effect to occasion this\r\nfertility. We considered it to arise chiefly from a quantity of nitre\r\nhaving been formed in, or deposited about, the walls from their long\r\nproximity to animal effluvia and to atmospheric air. The fertilizing\r\neffect of the dike system of summer-fallow, and even of the present\r\nsystem, may also depend in part on the formation of nitre, well known\r\nto be a powerful manure or stimulant in this country. In dry seasons we\r\nhave scraped together handfuls of salts, partly nitre, from the exposed\r\nsurface of clay-banks. Should a considerable part of the fertilizing\r\neffect of fallowing arise from the formation of nitre, the application\r\nof lime and putrescent manures to fallows, in the early part of\r\nsummer, will be advantageous, as the presence of both are favourable\r\nto the formation of nitre. Of course, the utility of encouraging the\r\nformation[63] of {326} nitre or other salts, combinations of potassa\r\nor of soda, will depend on the climate, whether much or little rain\r\nfalls, and whether the rain water goes off by evaporation or by\r\ndrainage. In the case of little rain, or the rain-water being nearly\r\nall evaporated, nitre and other salts will accumulate in the soil, so\r\nas, from their excess, to be injurious to vegetation; whereas, should\r\nmuch rain fall, or the rain-water be chiefly carried off by drainage,\r\nvegetation may languish from deficiency of these salts, there being\r\nless deposition of the salts, or the salts as they form being washed\r\naway. The same will apply to the graminivorous animals. Sea-salt,\r\nperhaps also nitre and other salts, will be serviceable in a moist\r\ncountry, or far from the sea, where the plants and water contain little\r\nsaline matter, and probably pernicious in a dry climate, where the\r\nplants and water generally contain much saline matter.\r\n\r\nIn the portion of the earth from the Atlantic eastward, through\r\nNumidia, Libya, Egypt, Nubia, Arabia, Persia, as far as the Indus,\r\nfrom the enormous ruins, and other vestiges of dense population,\r\nas well as from ancient records, there must have {327} existed a\r\nconsiderable depth of vegetable mould covering, where now little is\r\nleft but pure sand, baked clay, bare rock, and saline encrustations.\r\nFrom the footing which an industrious and brave nation has recently so\r\nhonourably acquired in this territory, may we not hope that the tide\r\nof arid sterility, dissipating the vegetable covering, will be turned,\r\nand that through European enterprise and mechanical science, by means\r\nof steam and wind power, a system of irrigation will be introduced\r\nwhich will reanimate this dead portion of the earth—spreading forth\r\nagain perpetual spring, strewing the desert all over with herbs, and\r\nfruits, and flowers, converting the sirocco into a breeze loaded with\r\nfragrance, and reproducing, in profusion, all the delights of the\r\ngardens of Hesperus? From the carbonaceous or soil-matter being burned\r\nout, and from the quantity of saline deposit, a very considerable time\r\nwill, however, elapse before production be generally extended, and\r\nthe desert so far circumscribed, and the ground cooled so much, as to\r\ncondense a sufficiency of rain and dew, that a new vegetable mould\r\ncover may be formed.\r\n\r\nBut to return from our wide exclusion, we observe, that Mr Cruickshank\r\nstates, page 25, “that any land that is proper for Scots fir will be\r\nfound to answer well with the larch.” This observation, with {328}\r\nwhat he says of larch “being heavier in proportion to its bulk” than\r\nScots fir, and that “spruce is very easily wrought, and tries the\r\ncarpenter’s tools less than any other kind of wood used in building,”\r\nwould lead us to suspect that our author has had a very limited\r\nacquaintance with his subject. A number of different soils will produce\r\nlarge Scots fir where larches will be generally rotted and hollow in\r\nthe heart, by twenty years of age[64]. This ignorance of our author is\r\nthe more glaring, as it is coupled with {329} some severe strictures\r\non planters in general for _their ignorance_ of the proper location\r\nof trees. He says, “Scots fir, on soils of a fertile character, is\r\nshort lived, and the excellence of its timber is in proportion to\r\nthe slowness of its growth.” This is erroneous. We would rather say\r\nit is short-lived in bad soil: Memel fir (Pinus sylvestris), is of\r\nvery superior quality, very large growthed, and of great age. He also\r\nasserts “elm prefers a strong clay soil, and it is perhaps impossible\r\nto bring this tree to the utmost size it is capable of attaining in\r\nland of a different quality.” This is also erroneous. We have seen very\r\nbeautiful large Scots elms grubbed out from a soil of pure gravel, and\r\nwe can show thousands of instances where Scots elms do not thrive well\r\nin clay—in rich as well as poor clay. We are aware that in every volume\r\ntreating of numerous facts, such as Mr Cruickshank’s, many inaccuracies\r\nmay always be picked out, but the above are rather too prominent.\r\n\r\nMr Cruickshank censures the practice of covering fir seeds one-half\r\ninch deep in England, referring the {330} demand there for Scots\r\nplants to the seeds being thus buried in place of being sown, and\r\nstates that they should only be covered one-fourth of an inch, as is\r\nthe practice in Aberdeenshire. He also reprehends the author of the\r\nEncyclopædia of Gardening, on account of some directions which this\r\nauthor has given, to form, by forcing, a fine friable soil, suitable\r\nfor the delicate seeds of trees, where this does not previously exist.\r\nNow, we should consider that the difference of climate between the\r\nneighbourhood of London and Aberdeen would require a difference of\r\ncover nearly equal to this; and that forcing a friable earth for\r\nseed-beds was absolutely necessary, in the very adhesive clays around\r\nLondon, and so general in the more recent formations of the south and\r\nmiddle of England, although superfluous in the north of Scotland,\r\nwhere sandy or light soil is sufficiently abundant. Seeds, under a\r\nmoist cloudy atmosphere, will vegetate without cover at all; but in\r\nsituations where the air is arid in spring, with much sunshine, a\r\ncovering of some depth is necessary, and that covering, where the\r\nrudiments of the plant spring out weak and delicate, is required to be\r\nsoft and friable, a good absorber and retainer of moisture, and not\r\ndisposed to run together with rain, or crack with drought.\r\n\r\nMr Cruickshank gives an account of our different {331} forest\r\ntrees, neither very accurate nor interesting, but, luckily, not very\r\ntedious. He then proceeds to treat of nursery, sowing, transplanting,\r\nand choosing of plants, where many sensible, though some of them\r\ncommon-place, observations occur, of much use to the generality\r\nof planters. His views, however, of the proper manner of planting\r\nseedlings in the nursery, are defective. The best method of planting\r\nthese—neither by laying, nor by dibbling—is first to stretch the\r\nline and make a furrow, level in the bottom, as broad as the roots\r\nmay stretch, with the inner side straight and steep. One person then\r\nholds the plant erect in its berth, from two to four inches from the\r\nperpendicular side, according to the general size of the horizontal\r\nroots, so that the fibres may be regularly spread; and another person\r\nthrows on the earth from the place of the next furrow; the placer of\r\nthe plants footing the earth to the roots as he proceeds, or after the\r\nrow is completed.\r\n\r\nThe following observations of Mr Cruickshank are worthy the attention\r\nof planters:\r\n\r\n “Proprietors should not attempt to raise seedlings, but purchase\r\n them from professional nurserymen, and place them in a succession\r\n nursery of their own. A proprietor may, in general, purchase seedlings\r\n much cheaper than he can raise them; while the case {332} is just the\r\n reverse with regard to plants of a greater age. In raising seedlings,\r\n much skill and attention is requisite, which the professional man can\r\n always command at a much more reasonable rate than the proprietor.\r\n In the treatment of plants after they are removed from the seed-bed,\r\n the rent of the ground is the chief source of expense, as any common\r\n gardener will be able to manage them.”\r\n\r\n “A general, and a very gross error, in purchasing plants, is to\r\n consider those as best which are the largest in proportion to their\r\n age. This absurd principle of selection makes those nurseries most\r\n frequented by customers which least deserve to be so, such, namely,\r\n as are situated in the richest soils, surrounded by the closest\r\n shelter, and stimulated by the greatest quantities of manure. It is\r\n necessary, no doubt, that plants should be of a size to suit them to\r\n the situations for which they are intended; but if they have attained\r\n this size sooner than the due time by being forced, they are in the\r\n worst state imaginable for growing in a barren moor, or on the bleak\r\n side of a mountain.”\r\n\r\n “Plants are often much injured, though raised sufficiently hardy in\r\n other respects, by being too much crowded in the nursery line.”—“The\r\n surest method that I know of enabling those who have little {333}\r\n experience, to ascertain whether plants, in the seed-bed, are too\r\n much crowded or not, is to compare such as grow on the verge of the\r\n alley with those in the interior. If the girt of the latter be equal,\r\n or nearly so, to that of the former, the plants have sufficient\r\n room.”—“When plants have stood for several years in nursery lines,\r\n if they are too much crowded, many of their lower branches will be\r\n sickly or withered, or the stems will be entirely devoid of branches,\r\n excepting within a few inches of the top. This is a mark so plain that\r\n no one can mistake.\r\n\r\n “Care should be taken not to purchase plants which betray symptoms of\r\n disease. When larches not more than three years old cast the whole,\r\n or even the greater part, of their leaves, just when the winter\r\n commences, it is a sure sign that they are in an unhealthy state, and\r\n that many of them will die in the course of next season; for, under\r\n this age, the larch should retain a considerable quantity of its old\r\n leaves till spring.”—“There is also a minute white insect, which\r\n is fatal to the larch in plantations, that sometimes attacks it in\r\n the nursery after it enters its second year; on this account, it is\r\n proper to examine the larch plants the summer previous to purchasing\r\n them.”—“Scots fir maybe regarded as sickly, when the points of the\r\n leaves become withered, or {334} when they change their naturally\r\n dark colours into a faint yellowish green. Any vestige of withering\r\n on the spruce or silver fir, is a sure prognostication of approaching\r\n decay. Any kind of fir which has lost its leader may be considered\r\n useless.\r\n\r\n “When plants are packed up in mats for the conveniency of carriage,\r\n strict orders should be given that those which carry their leaves in\r\n winter be taken up when they are entirely free from moisture. If they\r\n be pulled wet, they will heat and get mouldy in the packages. In the\r\n course of a few days good plants are often spoiled in this manner.”\r\n\r\nMr Cruickshank does not swerve from the common foolish system, of\r\ninculcating a determinate character of soil as generally necessary for\r\neach kind of tree. We are angry with the dulness of the writers on\r\nlocation of timber; they will not comprehend that a tree has two ends,\r\nby both of which it draws moisture, though from different elements,\r\nearth and air. The dullest clown is sensible he requires to drink more\r\nunder an arid sun than under a drizzling rain. The same holds of trees;\r\nif there be little evaporation of moisture from the leaves, and if the\r\nleaves, instead of exhaling, can frequently even imbibe water, from the\r\nplant occupying an elevated situation, where the air the greater part\r\nof the season {335} is cool, and nearly surcharged with moisture, the\r\nmost porous, driest soil (sufficiently damp in such a situation), will\r\ngenerally be the most suitable; and trees of every kind will prosper in\r\nsands, in which, under a dry atmosphere, they would not have survived\r\none summer; whereas in arid, warm, low country, the deepest, dampest\r\nloams and clays are generally the best suited for timber, provided\r\nwater does not stagnate. And, besides, we have found varieties of the\r\nsame kind or species of tree, _some of them adapted to prosper in dry\r\nair and soil, and others in moist air and soil_. Although the above\r\ncauses prevent a positive limitation of certain kinds of trees to\r\ncertain soils, yet there are some which have superior adaptation to\r\nmoist soils and others to dry; some whose roots, from their fibrous\r\nsoft character, can only spread luxuriantly on light, soft, or mossy\r\nsoils, and others, whose roots have power to permeate the stiffest\r\nand most obdurate. The above explanations will account for much of\r\nthe incongruity which we find in authors regarding the adaptation of\r\ncertain kinds of timber to certain soils.\r\n\r\nIn describing the soils suitable for different kinds of trees, Mr\r\nCruickshank mentions, that “the Scots fir will thrive in very barren\r\nsituations, provided the soil be dry. Dryness is, in fact, the {336}\r\nmost indispensable requisite in order to produce a good crop of Scots\r\nfir, and it is never advisable to plant this tree in very moist ground,\r\nor where draining is necessary to carry off the surface water.”—“Stiff\r\nland seems decidedly hostile to its growth.”—“On a deep rich soil\r\nit grows very fast, attains a large size, and soon decays. In these\r\ncircumstances, its wood is spongy, and of inferior value.”—“The most\r\nimportant precept that can be delivered with regard to this tree, is\r\nnever to plant it either in _wet_ or _very stiff_ land.”\r\n\r\n “The larch is also a very hardy plant, and is sure to thrive on any\r\n land that will answer for the Scots fir. It is, however, less delicate\r\n in its choice of soil than the latter, and will grow in a much greater\r\n degree of moisture.”—“This tree is one of the surest growers we have\r\n in barren soils.”\r\n\r\n “The spruce is as partial to moist land as the Scots fir is to dry;\r\n and in this particular these two species stand directly opposed to one\r\n another.”—“Spruce may indeed appear to thrive in a dry situation for\r\n a few years; but by the time it reaches ten or twelve feet in height,\r\n its lower branches will decay, and after that period it will make\r\n little progress, but remain even a cumberer of the soil.”—“ Spruce\r\n seems to be most partial to a cold stiff clay: it is, {337} however, a\r\n very hardy plant, and not very nice in its choice of soil, provided it\r\n have enough of sap.”—“I do not mean such as is deluged in winter with\r\n stagnant water. This is incompatible with the growth of wood of every\r\n kind.”—“The silver fir and balm of Gilead will answer in the same\r\n kinds of land as the spruce.”—“They, together with the spruce, are\r\n invaluable for where the soil is deep peat-moss, as neither the Scots\r\n fir nor the larch will thrive in it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is in the above quotations, in common with many of our opinions\r\n(formed hastily upon a too partial acquaintance with facts), a\r\nconsiderable proportion both of truth and error. Such sweeping\r\nassertions will, however, generally command the assent and admiration\r\nof the reader. From the enjoyment the mind has in forming clear\r\nconceptions and reaching conclusions, from its love of order, and from\r\nits disposition to cling to every thing like definite, unfluctuating\r\narrangement, to assist its limited powers of comprehension, we are led\r\naway by the author, who reduces the character of natural phenomena to\r\ngreat simplicity, although in reality exceedingly complicated.\r\n\r\nScots fir, it is true, has rather a superior adaptation to dry, sharp,\r\nand rocky soils; yet there are many {338} situations of poor wet till\r\nand clay, and even peat-moss ground, where it will be advantageous\r\nto plant Scots fir in preference to any other kind of timber; for\r\nthis plain reason, that no other kind will thrive so well in those\r\ncold moist moors. Both Larix and Abies have a much narrower range of\r\nadaptation than Pinus sylvestris. Larch will not thrive in the dead\r\nsand nor till flats of the low country, often not in the dead sand and\r\ntill of rising grounds, in both of which the Scots fir, if allowed\r\nsufficient room for side branching, will reach good-sized timber. There\r\nis a considerable formation of peat-moss near Dunmore, in which the\r\nScots fir has shown superior adaptation to the Norway spruce. We have\r\nalso seen, in the moss of Balgowan, Perthshire, fine thriving Scots\r\nfirs, many of them two feet in diameter, growing in very moist, rich,\r\nmossy loam,—so moist, that although in a rather protected situation,\r\na number of the trees, while young, had been laid on their sides by\r\nthe wind, and were growing luxuriantly in the form of a quadrant of\r\na circle, with as much as six and eight feet of the stem upon the\r\nlevel ground, affording a curve sufficient to reach from the keel of a\r\nvessel to the deck at midships. We examined the timber of several of\r\nthese, and found it superior to the average of home P. sylvestris. The\r\nsuperior {339} quality of the timber may be ascribed to the richness\r\nand moisture of the soil, and to the full branching of the trees from\r\ntheir rather open arrangement. There is nothing which conduces so much\r\nto the good quality of Scots fir as exposure. Under the great shelter\r\nof the close _planted_ woods, the timber is soft and porous, without\r\nmuch resin; but under great exposure, especially to dry air, the timber\r\nis hard, close, and resinous. This is, however, considerably modified\r\nby the soil.\r\n\r\nThe quality of natural grown timber is considered superior to the\r\nplanted. Is this occasioned by the former having generally more\r\nbranches and leaves in proportion to the length of the stem, and being\r\nmore exposed than the latter? Can root fracture at transplanting,\r\nor the kiln-drying of the cones, have any influence to diminish the\r\nstrength of the fibre or quantity of resinous deposit? We have been\r\ntold by several old people, in the neighbourhood of Dunsinane, that\r\nScots fir plants, brought more than half a century ago from Mar Forest\r\nto Dunsinane Wood, succeeded much better than some which had been\r\nprocured from nurseries, and also produced better timber.\r\n\r\nClay is assuredly _not_ the proper soil for spruce and silver fir;\r\ntheir exceedingly numerous, soft, fibrous, moss-like rootlets, require\r\nan easy damp soil. {340} We have tried a number of kinds of abies,\r\nin both dry and moist clay, and have found they did not grow so\r\nluxuriantly (thrive so well) as Scots fir or larch. The silver fir\r\nshewed superior adaptation to any of the other kinds of abies.\r\n\r\nAlmost in every instance where we have seen the silver fir and Norway\r\nspruce (by far the best spruce for Scotland) growing together, the\r\nformer was the superior. The timber, in the lower part of the stem, is\r\nharder than that of the spruce, but freer and more porous in the upper\r\npart. It is probable that the silver fir will not thrive in so elevated\r\nor so moist a situation as the spruce, but in all favourable soils it\r\nmerits a preference.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a very important part of our author’s volume—an account\r\nof the most economical, and, as he says, the most successful, mode\r\nof planting moors and bleak exposed mountains, but which is brought\r\nforward by him under no limitation to place. To the invention of this\r\nmethod, our author lays no claim; he merely describes the practice in a\r\nclear and judicious manner.\r\n\r\n “The most proper time for removing firs from the nursery to waste\r\n land, is when they are two years old.”—“The experience I have had\r\n enables me to say, with as much confidence as I can speak on {341}\r\n any point whatever, that the longer any fir is allowed to remain\r\n in the nursery after it has attained two years’ growth, so much\r\n the less chance is there of its success when removed to its final\r\n destination.”—“At this period (two years’ growth) larches may be\r\n obtained transplanted, as it is customary to put considerable numbers\r\n of them out into nursery-lines when they are one year old. Such plants\r\n have better roots than those that have remained in the seed-bed till\r\n they are of the same age; but as their price is considerably higher\r\n than that of the latter, it is somewhat doubtful whether they are so\r\n much superior in quality as to compensate for the greater expense. At\r\n all events, healthy larches from the seed-bed have never failed to\r\n give satisfaction when properly planted in soil suitable for them.\r\n Other species of fir are scarce ever transplanted in the nursery till\r\n they are two years old, so of this age there is no choice left but to\r\n take them from the seed-bed.”—“Birch, alder, and mountain ash, succeed\r\n well when removed from the nursery in their second year.”—“Beech\r\n and plane do not succeed well unless they have stood some time (two\r\n years at least) in nursery lines, after having been removed from the\r\n seed-bed.”\r\n\r\n “The pitting system of planting should be {342} adopted in every\r\n instance in which the plants exceed two years old.\r\n\r\n “The expense of planting was much reduced by the introduction, about a\r\n century ago, of the notching system. Of this there are two varieties,\r\n the oldest of which may be described as follows:—One person makes a\r\n notch in the ground, or rather two notches crossing each other, with\r\n a common spade, raising the sod by bending down the handle of the\r\n instrument, till the notch become wide enough to receive the roots of\r\n the plant. An assistant, with a bundle of trees, slips the root of\r\n one into the aperture thus made for its reception. The spade is then\r\n withdrawn, and the closing of the sod on the root is assisted by a\r\n smart blow of the heel of the planter. In this way two persons, well\r\n practised in the work, will put into the ground between five hundred\r\n and a thousand per day.\r\n\r\n “This system was much simplified about fifty years ago, and rendered\r\n so expeditious, that it seems in vain to look for its receiving any\r\n further improvement. Instead of the spade, an instrument of nearly\r\n the same shape, but so small that it can be wrought with one hand as\r\n easily as a common garden-dibble, was introduced, and is now known by\r\n the name of the Planting-iron. With this, a notch is made in {343}\r\n the ground to receive the root; and owing to the portability of the\r\n tool, and its occupying but one of the hands, the person that works it\r\n requires no assistant, but, carrying a parcel of plants in a wallet\r\n before him, he singles out one with his left hand, inserts it in the\r\n notch, withdraws the implement, fixes the plant with his heel, and\r\n proceeds with as much apparent ease as if he were performing the\r\n operation in the soft ground of the nursery. In this way of planting,\r\n the workman goes forward in such a line as he can judge of by his eye;\r\n and as it is extremely difficult to see the plants after they are put\r\n in, especially if the heath is pretty long, he sets up poles in the\r\n first line, to enable him to keep the second a due distance from it;\r\n and in planting the last mentioned, he removes these poles into it as\r\n he comes opposite to them, which then serve as his guide in planting\r\n the third; and thus he proceeds till he cover the whole ground. The\r\n lines thus formed are necessarily so zig-zag, that when the trees grow\r\n up, they do not seem to have been planted in rows.\r\n\r\n “In this way, an expert workman will plant between three and four\r\n thousand young plants a-day, and do it so perfectly, that the fault\r\n will not be his if a single individual of the whole number fail to\r\n {344} grow. I have assisted in planting, according to this plan,\r\n upwards of three thousand acres in Aberdeenshire; and, in all that\r\n extent, I know not of a single instance of failure, where the plants\r\n were in a healthy state when put into the ground, of the proper age\r\n and varieties, and suitable for the soil.”\r\n\r\n “To plant well and expeditiously in this way, requires considerable\r\n dexterity on the part of the workman; and where raw hands are\r\n employed, it will be necessary to have some person to teach and\r\n superintend them.”\r\n\r\nMr Cruickshank disposes of the old cross system of slit planting\r\nby the spade, with very little ceremony; as it would almost seem,\r\nwithout being able to appreciate its merits. It is, in fact, a totally\r\ndifferent mode of planting from that by the flat dibble-planter or\r\nplanting-iron, and is well adapted for all plants with horizontal\r\nroots, and which have stood from one to three years in the nursery\r\nline. By first striking the spade in perpendicularly, as deep as the\r\nturf-soil, by again striking it in at right angles to the end of\r\nthe first cut, in the form of a T, and bending back the spade, the\r\nturf-soil is raised from a horizontal bed, and the first cut opened so\r\nwide as to admit the root, which {345} inserted and drawn a little\r\nalong by an experienced hand, and well tramped down, has its rootlets\r\ndisposed over the horizontal bottom almost as regularly and well\r\nadjusted for growing, as can be done by pit-planting. This practice\r\nis sometimes performed singly, a clever workman managing the spade\r\nwith one hand and the plants with the other, and inserting 1000 each\r\nday. The plants suited for this system are fully double the size of\r\nthose suited for the flat-dibble system, and are purchased at about\r\none half more price, thus enhancing the cost of planting to £1, 10s.\r\nor £2 per acre; but in many situations, especially where the herbage\r\ngrows freely, affording an earlier growth, and more regular success,\r\nsufficient to balance the greater expense ten times over.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cross-system of slitting is the best for commanding\r\ngeneral success, yet wherever the flat dibble planting can be depended\r\non, it merits a preference, as from the smallness of the plants, the\r\nroots receive less fracture and derangement in the woody state, and the\r\nprocess comes nearer to raising from the seed _in situ_.\r\n\r\nThe expense of each system per acre, will be nearly as follows:— {346}\r\n\r\n _By Cross-slitting, or the Double Notch._\r\n\r\n 3000 larches and Scots firs, from one to three years transplanted,\r\n   at 5s.

To\r\neffect economical planting in these soils, it is necessary to have the\r\nplants sufficiently large, not too close together, and placed in rows,\r\nthat a mower may be able to distinguish them among the herbage while\r\nhe cuts it down; or what is much better, that the spade or plough[65]\r\nculture may be {348} practised, and potatoes, turnips, or other green\r\ncrop, raised among them, without the plants being overwhelmed. In case\r\nof grass production, the oftener during the season the young plantation\r\nis mown, the more advantageous, as well that the plants may be the more\r\neasily distinguished, as that the lower branches may not be smothered,\r\nnor the soil so much exhausted and dried by the blooming and seeding\r\nof the herbage; of course, a short scythe is required, and also a very\r\ncareful mower.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the best season for planting, Mr Cruickshank states:—\r\n\r\n “In wet and swampy soils, as well as in land, whether dry or moist,\r\n whose surface is bare, I would be inclined to prefer the spring. Wet\r\n land swells to such a degree, that plants which have not had time to\r\n take a firm hold with their roots, are almost {349} inevitably thrown\r\n out.”—“These remarks have reference only to the system of planting by\r\n notching: when the pitting system is adopted, it fixes the plant so\r\n thoroughly, as to render the utmost power of frost incapable of doing\r\n them any injury.”—“The utmost limits of the planting season may be\r\n estimated from the middle of October to the middle of March.”—“I am a\r\n decided advocate for thick planting, and would advise that no fewer\r\n than 3000 trees per acre be planted in good land, nor a less number\r\n than 4000 when the soil is of a middling or inferior quality.”\r\n\r\nMr Cruickshank must surely have had little acquaintance with soft,\r\nspongy, close-bottomed soils, or he would not have asserted that\r\npit-planted trees are not subject to be thrown. If planted in the early\r\npart of winter or autumn, trees of the usual size, which have remained\r\nfrom one to three years in the nursery line, are very frequently\r\nthrown from such soils. This is caused by the freezing earth first\r\ncatching fast hold of the plant at the surface, and afterwards swelling\r\nunderneath from the enlargement of the freezing water in its pores,\r\nand from the open crystallized _honeycomb_ arrangement which takes\r\nplace by congelation. As the stem is fast to {350} the ground at the\r\nsurface, and the earth subsequently enlarged underneath as far as the\r\ncongelation proceeds, the roots below the congelation must of necessity\r\nbe drawn upwards to the distance which the ground has swelled after\r\nthe stem was fixed to the surface. The earth, on thaw, first loses\r\nhold of the plant at the surface, and then falls away as it contracts.\r\nEach successive frost and thaw during winter thus raises the plant a\r\ncertain space, till by spring it often is so far extracted, as to fall\r\nover on its side. When the plant has stood a season, there is generally\r\na tuft of herbage around its stem, which prevents the freezing in a\r\nconsiderable degree; and the roots having fixed in the lower earth,\r\nresist the pulling up so much, that the hold which the frozen earth has\r\nof the stem at the surface gives way, sometimes pulling off a portion\r\nof the bark, and the earth rises around the stem in place of pulling\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nInstead of the season for spring planting being over by the middle of\r\nMarch, we think that, in many of our wet moors, it should then only\r\nbe commencing, especially under the pitting system. However, planting\r\nshould never be deferred a day later in spring than what is absolutely\r\nnecessary to render the ground sufficiently dry for the process. {351}\r\n\r\nMr Cruickshank’s opinions regarding pruning and thinning are generally\r\nnot very incorrect. His commencing sentence on pruning, that “most\r\ndeciduous trees, if left to themselves, have a tendency to grow with\r\nshort trunks, containing little timber, and to waste their strength\r\non large unwieldy tops,” would, however, lead us to form a different\r\nconclusion. The very tall, clean, straight, deciduous trees, in the\r\nAmerican forests, give a sufficient answer to this. We like his remark\r\nrespecting thinning, that “it is only efficacious when applied as a\r\npreventive, not as a cure.”\r\n\r\nMr Cruickshank next brings forward his plan of raising oak forest,\r\nwhich appears to have been his own invention, although invented before.\r\nWhenever mice and other gnawers (glires) are not very abundant, it,\r\nif properly executed, would seem to be the best method of raising oak\r\nforest; and, indeed, in many situations, the only practicable one. Mr\r\nCruickshank’s method coincides nearly with Mr Sang’s, only he does not\r\ncarry his system of protection so far as Mr Sang, in first raising\r\nbelts of the most hardy kinds of timber, distributed to windward of,\r\nand intersecting the place intended to be planted, in such a manner as\r\nto afford the best possible shelter from the coldest most destructive\r\n{352} winds. Mr Cruickshank, who has never carried his plan into\r\nexecution, except in an experiment embracing a few yards, directs that\r\nthe ground intended for oak forest should first be planted with Scots\r\nfir and larch, about 4000 to the acre, by the single-notch process,\r\npreviously described, which can be accomplished under L. 1 per acre. As\r\nsoon as these have risen to four feet in height, he prepares patches\r\nabout two feet square and ten feet distant in the interstices, by\r\ndigging the soil over, and mixing a spadeful of slaked lime carefully\r\nwith the mould, taking out a tree whenever the interstices do not suit\r\nfor the patches. He then plants, in the end of March or beginning\r\nof April, five acorns in each patch, about an inch deep, one in\r\nthe centre, and the other four in the angles of a foot square, and\r\ngives them no farther attention for two years, except removing any\r\noverhanging low fir branch. He then goes over the patches, cutting out\r\nall the supernumerary plants, a few inches below the surface, leaving\r\nthe most promising one on each patch, being very careful not to disturb\r\nany of its roots in cutting out the others. As these oak plants extend\r\nin size, he gradually removes the fir.\r\n\r\nExcepting the bare plan itself, which is certainly very plausible,\r\nthere is nothing in the description {353} of the practice—the\r\npreparation of the patches of ground to receive the seed and the\r\nsubsequent management—which merits attention. His very particular\r\ninterdiction of the use of manure is, to say the least of it,\r\ninjudicious—as if it signified to the plant whether it were forced by\r\nthe use of lime, or by a little putrescent manure, both of which Mr\r\nWithers would consider very advantageous; or as if there were much fear\r\non our poor exposed wastes of erring on the side of rendering the plant\r\ndelicate from over luxuriance; its constitution, on the contrary, would\r\nrather be strengthened. Mr Cruickshank, in directing the removal of\r\nthe fir nurses, one thousand per acre to stand till they have reached\r\ntwenty-five years, fit for roofing of cottages, and similar purposes;\r\nand five hundred till they have reached thirty-five years; his dividing\r\na slaked boll of lime into five hundred spadefuls; and his bestowing no\r\nhoeing or weeding upon his seedlings, would show, without his admitting\r\nit, that he had never practised this mode of forming plantation.\r\n\r\nPrefacing this system of rearing oak forest, Mr Cruickshank in rather\r\na clever manner points out its advantages, and also the disadvantages\r\nand consequent failures of _planting_ young oak trees in exposed\r\nsituations. But after all his eulogy, we think he has {354} left\r\nsomething unsaid. The great disadvantage attending transplanting oaks\r\nto situations not very favourable to their growth, is, that the plant\r\nwhich, under any circumstances, receives irreparable and often mortal\r\nharm, from the severe injuries of removal, has to contend, in this\r\nmutilated condition, at the same time with the uninjured occupiers of\r\nthe soil (the nurses or the native weeds), and with the unpropitious\r\nsituation; whereas, when the plant springs up from the acorn a native,\r\nespecially when it is assisted at first by weeding or hoeing, the part\r\nabove ground being always in proportion to that below, and receiving\r\ndue nourishment, it contends with the occupiers on more equal terms,\r\nand encounters the sterility of the soil, or the severity of the\r\nclimate, with all its natural powers unimpaired.\r\n\r\nAs it is the natural condition of the seedling to grow up under the\r\nshelter of the parent tree, so also does it happen, that it rises under\r\nthis shelter with greater luxuriance and vigour than when exposed to\r\nthe evaporation, and parching sun, and battering wind, of the bare\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe have admired the beautiful, straight, luxuriant, shoots of the\r\nyoung hollies, thrown out under shelter, and have compared them with\r\nthe dry stunted shoots of the young holly in the open country, though\r\nin the former case their roots had to contend {355} with the roots\r\nof larger trees, and in the latter they had the soil to themselves.\r\nExperience has proved, that in exposed bleak situations, shelter is\r\nnecessary to young plants. Transplanted oaks among the roots of young\r\ntrees, so large as to afford sufficient shelter, very frequently do not\r\nsucceed, at least without the utmost care in the transplanting, and a\r\nconsiderable deal of labour to prevent the roots of the shelter trees\r\nfrom starving the transplanted ones, unless a very propitious moist\r\nsummer follow the transplanting. Raising from the seed, which obviates\r\nall this, seems therefore the only conveniently practicable way. Yet it\r\nmust be owned, that the system of raising forests _in situ_ from the\r\nseed, appears, as yet, much more successful on paper than on our hills\r\nand moors.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to confute the opinion, that the oak will not grow\r\nthroughout Scotland, but in the milder and more propitious situations,\r\nMr Cruickshank adduces the well-known fact, that large oak timber is\r\nfound in almost every peat-moss.\r\n\r\nThis is a fact worth tracing to its cause. Under Nature’s own conduct,\r\ntrees advance considerably further into elevated or cold inhospitable\r\nregions, than they would otherwise do, by means of the mutual shelter,\r\nand of the more hardy kinds acting as an advance guard. Yet there is a\r\nlimit to this, as the {356} power of ripening seed is not increased\r\nby shelter in proportion to the power of growing—perhaps not at all;\r\nwe instance the Spanish chestnut, which has scarcely ever been known\r\nto ripen seed in Scotland. Seed-grown trees will, therefore, under\r\nNature’s arrangement, not be found extending much beyond _the line of\r\nseed ripening_. From nuts, acorns, and other seeds, fully developed,\r\nbeing found in elevated mosses in this country, other causes than\r\nshelter appear to have existed.\r\n\r\nBefore this country was so much overrun by men and oxen, a great deal\r\nof timber had existed, covering much of the superior land which is now\r\nunder tillage. This consisted chiefly of the oak, Scots fir, birch,\r\nhazel, and alder,—the oak extending northward and to elevations, and\r\nripening seed, and attaining to a size which it does not now do, either\r\nwild or cultivated, in the same latitude, neither here nor in any other\r\nportion of the world; which, along with some other facts, lead to the\r\nsupposition, that the climate has changed a little,—in part, possibly,\r\nas we have before stated, from the gradual formation of peat, to which,\r\noverthrown oak forest, from the abundance of the tannin principle, has\r\na great disposing influence, even under a warmer climate than present\r\nScotland. The highest latitude to which a tree, or any other kind of\r\nplant, reproducing by seed, {357} naturally extends, depending on the\r\nripening of the seed, and also on the power of occupancy, is however\r\ndifferent from that where it will grow, when ripe seeds are procured\r\nfrom the coldest place where they ripen, and all the competitors\r\nremoved; and under the system of shelter belts, hardy pine nurses, and\r\nseeds from the nearest place where they ripen, we have no doubt that\r\noaks may be extended to a colder situation than Nature herself would\r\nhave placed them in. For the higher more bleak portion of the country,\r\nwe would recommend acorns grown in Scotland, in preference to those\r\nimported from England. We have several times observed wheat, the seed\r\nof which had been imported from England, sustain blight and other\r\ninjuries in a cold moist autumn, when a portion of the same field, sown\r\nof Scots seed, at the same time as the other, and under the very same\r\ncircumstances, was entirely free from injury. English acorns are also\r\nfrequently heated in the casks in which they are imported, which must\r\nimpair their vigour[66]. {358}\r\n\r\nThe part of Mr Cruickshank’s volume which we have analyzed, does\r\nnot extend much beyond the first half: this portion is well worth a\r\nperusal. We have merely glanced over the remainder: it is a make-up\r\nscarce worth noticing. The language, on the whole, is easy and plain;\r\nand although the volume contains a considerable number of errors, in\r\nthe pointing out of which we have not been sparing, yet will it form an\r\nexcellent planter’s assistant to people who have ground to plant, and\r\nare ignorant of the process of planting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now brought before the reader a pretty fair picture of the\r\nForestry of the present day. Some may wonder that the written science\r\nof arboriculture should be so imperfect and inaccurate; but the\r\nknowledge of the art, and the power of communicating that knowledge,\r\nare of so different a {359} character, it not unfrequently happens,\r\nthat those write who cannot act, and those who can, are incompetent\r\nto write—sometimes unwilling; besides, correct opinions on this\r\nsubject, as on most others, are only just beginning to be formed.\r\nWe have endeavoured to assist in disentangling the correct from\r\nthe erroneous. It is impossible for the most wary always to avoid\r\nmisconception of facts, but man merits the name of rational only, when\r\nhe evinces a readiness to break from those misconceptions, to which\r\nthe narrow-minded, the proud, the vain, and the creature of habit\r\nand instinct, cling so obstinately. As a friend, we have stood on no\r\nceremony with our brother arboriculturists. We have laid ourselves open\r\nto their criticism, and we hope they will shew as little ceremony with\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDNOTES TO PART IV.\r\n\r\n[36] This repetition of our directions on pruning is\r\nintentional—“Carthago est delenda.”\r\n\r\n[37] The coniferæ have a weaker or more connected vitality than most\r\nother trees—the whole individual participating in the injury of any\r\npart. Perhaps this arises from the liability of resinous juice to\r\nputrescency—any putrid affection in one spot of the more vital part of\r\nthe tree spreading quickly over the whole.\r\n\r\n[38] Transplanting having an opposite influence on the young of\r\nherbaceous and woody vegetables, in the former when not already rising\r\ninto stem, retarding, and the latter accelerating or furthering\r\ndevelopment of the reproductory parts, is a good lesson to reasoners\r\nfrom analogy. The root-fractured herbaceous plants repairing the injury\r\nalmost immediately, and before the rudiments of the reproductory parts\r\nhave time for expansion, the greater quantity of moist nourishment\r\nafforded by the unsought newly stirred soil, produces a flush of\r\nradical leaves, which react to further the extension of the roots. The\r\nnew rootlets have again more connexion to promote the growth of the\r\nradical leaves, and to induce offsets—_tillering_—from the sides of the\r\nbulb, than to nourish or mature the core part, from whence the stem\r\narises—a certain comparative extension and maturity of the core being\r\nnecessary to the rising of the stem. Thence seeding can be retarded,\r\nand life in annuals be continued, _ad libitum_. On the contrary, in\r\nwoody vegetables of perennial stem, the reparation of the root-injury\r\ntakes place slowly, and the evaporation from the stem and elevated\r\nbranches and leaves exhausting the little moisture afforded by the\r\ninadequate root-suction during an entire season, gives time and bias\r\nfor the germs to pass into reproductory instead of productory organs\r\neven the first season.\r\n\r\n[39] We rather think Mr Sang mentions this.\r\n\r\n[40] They say a better management has lately been established. This may\r\nbe followed for a short time in the high stream of the agitation, or\r\nwhile the present heads of management remain in power; but the system,\r\nwe fear, contains the seeds of evil, which, like the weeds, will soon\r\noverwhelm the alien good.\r\n\r\n[41] The inferior growth of the part of a hedge which was pruned\r\nbefore the vegetation had begun, may be ascribed to the vital action\r\nhaving been checked at the commencement by the destruction of the buds\r\nnecessary to stimulate this action; and being deprived of this first\r\nstrong impulse, life had remained languid throughout the season, the\r\nroots never recovering their proper suction or foraging power;—when the\r\npruning was later, a sufficient stimulus had already been given.\r\n\r\n[42] Vide Sir Walter Scott.\r\n\r\n[43] The want of the annual layers of cellular tissue of wood, exterior\r\nto and separating the annual lineal tubes, is so complete in some cases\r\nof slow growth, that the timber seems only a light congeries of tubes,\r\nwithout arrangement; hence the age of the tree cannot be determined but\r\nby a section of the root-bulb, where the growths are larger, and the\r\ndeposits regular.\r\n\r\n[44] The climate of a country in regard to annual steadiness, can be\r\npretty accurately determined by the appearance of the annual layers\r\nof trees, especially of the pine tribe; and in a new settlement where\r\ngreat difference of size of layer, and of resinous deposit is observed,\r\nwe may be pretty certain the seasons are not steady, or that insect\r\ndepredations or blights occur; and a reserve of food ought always\r\nto be retained. By careful inspection of the nature of the annual\r\nwood deposit, or of the locality with regard to moisture, it may be\r\nascertained, whether the irregularity has been owing to difference of\r\ntemperature, or of moisture. In warm climates the irregularity will\r\ngenerally depend on drought and moisture, and in cold climates on\r\nheat and cold; though sometimes the depredations of insects, such as\r\nlocusts, or of blights, may be the cause.\r\n\r\n[45] Though we give this experiment, we admit that little dependence\r\ncan be placed upon a single fact. The trees must have been different in\r\nvariety, and probably in sex, both of which may occasion a discrepancy.\r\n\r\n[46] The time the weight is in suspension, must be attended to. A beam\r\nwill support a much greater weight during a minute than during an hour;\r\nand two beams may be found, the one capable of supporting the greatest\r\nweight during a minute, and the other the greatest during an hour.\r\n\r\n[47] We shall not here introduce the interminable discussion of\r\ndry-rot, as it remains to be proved that moderately fast grown young\r\ntimber is at all more liable to dry-rot than small-growthed old,\r\nprovided the sap-wood be entirely removed.\r\n\r\n[48] In fairness, it may be proper to explain, that the greater part\r\nof the trees we have thus cultivated have been of _Pyrus_, although\r\nwe commenced the practice with common forest trees—yet the pear and\r\napple vary nothing from the oak and ash in the primary stage of life,\r\nin as far as respects the extension—we can also profit fully as much\r\nby raising apple timber of proper fast grown variety, as by any other\r\ntimber; and have it in our power to sell this timber to machine-makers\r\nat double the price of oak of the same size.\r\n\r\n[49] We think Sir Henry would find some of the failures of which he\r\nowns he cannot well ascertain the cause, but occurring especially in\r\nbeech and oak, to be owing to a number of the lower roots, which are\r\nby far the tenderest, being bruised by the weight of the tree itself,\r\nwhen he turns it repeatedly over from the one side to the other, in\r\norder, by throwing in earth beneath it, to raise the root on a level\r\nwith the surface of the field, the whole weight of the incumbent mass\r\nresting upon these soft roots. The oak, and still more the beech, are\r\nexceedingly susceptible to injury from cutting or bruises, and die far\r\ninward from the laceration. The wounded lower roots, especially when\r\nany vacuity is left not filled close in with earth, where mouldiness\r\nmight generate in a dry situation, or when soaking in moisture for a\r\npart of the season, will become corrupted; the putrefaction thence\r\ngradually extending upward into the bulb, will contaminate the whole,\r\nand the second or third year after planting, the tree will be dead.\r\n\r\n[50] We understand freezing the earth around the bulb is an old\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n[51] We particularize the oak, cork-tree of arid warm Spain, and\r\nmuch of the timber of New Holland. Owing to the hot parching air\r\nin the latter place, the epidermis becomes dried to such a degree,\r\nthat contracting by the drought, and bursting by the swelling of the\r\nenveloped stem, it peels off like the old skin of a serpent, and\r\nis often seen hanging upon the tree in large shreds like tattered\r\ngarments. In several kinds of trees, we have counted regular annual\r\nrings of desiccated bark; in some kinds this appeared a growth or\r\ndeposition, in others, mere parched exuviæ. Trees attain some age\r\nbefore the _exuviæ_ commence; the _deposit_ begins the first season,\r\neven in sheltered situations. The cork-tree, and the small-leaved\r\nelm, shew the greatest annual deposit of dry bark. The former does,\r\nand the latter is said to belong to warm arid countries; both form a\r\nbetter nonconductor of heat than any other dry bark we are acquainted\r\nwith—infinitely better than the bark exuviæ of trees which approach the\r\npolar regions.\r\n\r\n[52] We do not pretend to explain how it is, that one kind of climbing\r\nplant follows the sun in its convolutions, and another traverses his\r\ncourse. There surely cannot be any thing in a habit acquired in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[53] In proceeding further on in Sir Henry’s volume, we have noticed an\r\nexcellent observation quoted from Du Hamel: “The extension of the shoot\r\nis inversely as its induration, rapid while it remains herbaceous,\r\nbut slow as it is converted into wood. Hence moisture and shade are\r\nthe circumstances, of all others, the most favourable to elongation,\r\nbecause they prevent induration or retard it.” Although quoting this,\r\nSir Henry recurs to his old opinions, and proceeds to observe, “Trees\r\nso circumstanced, push upward to the light; and from the warmth\r\nwhich their situation affords, their stems being thin and slender in\r\nproportion to their height, they are destitute of strength to resist\r\nthe winds.”\r\n\r\n[54] We do not mention temperature, because we are not in possession\r\nof facts sufficient to lead us to form an opinion on the subject.\r\nJudging from animal analogy, of which our author is so fond, we\r\nnotice, that those animals exposed in open atmosphere, have generally\r\nwarmer blood than those who lurk in holes,—even than those of the same\r\nspecies who happen to live under shelter. Now evaporation takes place\r\nfrom animals as well as from vegetables, and the consequent cold is\r\nmore than balanced by the heat of what may be termed the vital fire,\r\nwhich, like most other fires, burns brightest on exposure to a current\r\nof atmospheric air, being increased either by the result of the new\r\nchemical combinations having less capacity for heat, or by the stimulus\r\nof the fresh moving air exciting the vital action. Of the general\r\ninfluence of close forest on temperature, we are also not very well\r\nassured; but the few facts which observation has afforded, lead to the\r\nopinion, that to the northward of 50 deg. Lat. forests have higher\r\ntemperature than bare country; that from about 50 to 30 degrees Lat.\r\nforests are cooler in winter and warmer in summer; and that nearer\r\nthe equator, forests are generally cooler than bare country. But the\r\ntemperature is regulated so much by the position of seas and lakes, in\r\ncombination with the prevailing currents and strength of currents of\r\nthe air—by the configuration of the country,—moisture and cloudiness of\r\nthe atmosphere and quantity of rain,—by the composition, arrangement,\r\nand colour of the soil,—by the lower vegetable cover, and even by the\r\nnature of the forest itself, whether deciduous or evergreen, that\r\nparticular facts must be very carefully weighed to enable us to reach\r\ngeneral conclusions. It is generally understood, that forests render\r\nthe climate moister.\r\n\r\n[55] Our experiments have not yet been carried so far, as to determine\r\nif, by any arrangement of drying or exposure, they may be seasoned\r\nto sustain intense frost, which may affect them differently from\r\nmoderate frost, either by causing complete congelation of all their\r\nstructure (moderate freezing appearing only to congeal their fluids,\r\nbut not entirely the containing vessel, at least only partly congealing\r\nthe mass), or by killing the vital principle itself through nervous\r\naffection. The potatoes became green from the exposure to the light,\r\nand we rather think acquired greater hardihood of constitution, or\r\ngreater vitality or excitability by the exposure, thence greater power\r\nto resist the cold, independent of the disposition they acquired by\r\ndesiccation to endure it.\r\n\r\n[56] Is the rending of the stems of trees, during intense frost,\r\ninternal only, and occasioned by the alburnum expanding more by\r\ncongelation than the drier mature wood? or, is it external, and caused\r\nby the contractile effect of the dry air and cold on the alburnum\r\nrendering it insufficient to surround the mature wood, which, from\r\ndryness and want of living susceptibility, may not contract so much.\r\n\r\n[57] The fineness of vessel or fibre of the Siberian crab, may be\r\ninduced by the arid warm air, the continued radiation of heat and\r\nlight upon the portion above ground, and the coldness of the ground\r\naround the roots during the short summer in Siberia, where the air\r\nand surface of the ground is warm, and vegetation progressive, while\r\nthe ground remains frozen at a small depth. Like all varieties of\r\nplants habituated to colder climate, the Siberian crab developes its\r\nleaves under less heat than varieties of the same kind which have been\r\nhabituated to milder climate.\r\n\r\n[58] We have not taken Sir Henry in the literal sense. Timber is well\r\nknown to decay sooner in a warm than in a cold country, _cæteris\r\nparibus_.\r\n\r\n[59] See Appendix F.\r\n\r\n[60] The preliminary sentence is very vaguely worded; we suppose,\r\n“increasing the annual circles,” means increasing them in thickness,\r\nnot general contents of length multiplied by thickness. But even in the\r\nlatter sense, we hold pruning tends generally to diminish the annual\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n[61] It is a theory of Mr Sheriff, Mungo’s Wells, that all plants have\r\nexcrementitious deposit from the roots, the deposit from one kind\r\naffording a good manure to another kind. Thence the advantage of mixed\r\ngrasses and legumes in pastures, and of the rotation of different kinds\r\nof crops.\r\n\r\n[62] Vegetable soil is sometimes buried deep under volcanic mud, sand,\r\nand ashes, or mixed with the subsoil by earthquakes. In some districts\r\nof South America, the country, from being fertile, has been recently\r\nreduced to sterility, by the vegetable mould being so much scattered\r\nthrough the subsoil by repeated upheavings and tossings about by\r\nearthquakes, as to be out of the reach of plants.\r\n\r\n[63] There is a deposition from the atmosphere of saline matter going\r\non at the surface of the earth, either evaporated from the ocean, and\r\nfalling with the rain and dews, or formed by gaseous combinations—most\r\nprobably both. In countries where the quantity of rain is insufficient\r\nto wash this saline accumulation away into the ocean as fast as it is\r\nformed, it increases to such a degree as almost to prevent vegetation,\r\nonly a few of what are termed saline plants appearing. This saline\r\naccumulation in warm dry countries, bears considerable analogy to\r\ntannin deposit in cold countries.\r\n\r\n[64] The matured timber of the larch, in some cases, remains for a\r\nconsiderable time stained before the rot proceeds rapidly; in other\r\ncases, the rot makes quick progress; in this rapid decomposition,\r\ncertain kinds of fungi assist greatly. When once seated, they seem\r\nto form a putrid atmosphere or tainted circle around them, either by\r\ntheir living exhalations, or corrupt emanations when dead, which is\r\npoisonous to the less vital parts of superior life, and also expedites\r\nthe commencement of decay in sound dead organic matter, such as timber,\r\nthus furthering the decomposition so far as to render it suitable food\r\nfor their foul appetite, and paving the way to their further progress.\r\n\r\nHow their seeds enter into the heart of a growing tree having no\r\nexternal rottenness, is not very obvious, unless they are inhaled or\r\nimbibed by the root tendrils: from the resemblance which the growth\r\nof some of them has to fermentation, it is not even very improbable\r\nthat the animalcules of supposed molecular or inferior life, have,\r\nof themselves, a disposition to unite into some of these aggregates\r\nwithout the presence of any disposing germ.\r\n\r\nThe modifications of material attractions, by the varied germs of\r\nsuperior life—the fixity of some of these deposites after life is\r\ngone—the resolution of these into inferior animalcular, or even\r\nmolecular, life—and the instrumentality of zoophytes of the lower order\r\nof organization, in hastening this decomposition by the balancing\r\nof the attractions of this secondary life, afford a wide field for\r\ninvestigation. Those uncouth sportings of nature quickly appear and\r\ndisappear as _material_ spectres, feeding on corruption, and mocking at\r\nprimary life.\r\n\r\n[65] We have raised crops among young trees (as well timber as fruit\r\ntrees), not four yards apart, by plough culture, and have found the\r\nprocess, after the ploughmen and horses were accustomed to it, not\r\nmuch more expensive than common cultivation, and the crop, till the\r\ntrees became too close, scarcely inferior. By means of a long _muzzle_\r\nto the plough standing out towards the left side, and a driver to the\r\nhorses beside the ploughman, we succeeded in getting the two first\r\nfurrows lapped a little over each other in the row of trees, where\r\nthe gathering of the ridge commenced (we gathered up at every other\r\nrow). In the row of trees where the finishing of the ploughing of the\r\nridge occurred, we were obliged to leave a stripe of ground about two\r\nfeet wide, to be dug by the spade. The horses required to be yoked in\r\nfile, and to drag by ropes (traces) rather than by chains, as the bark\r\nof the trees was liable to be rubbed off by the latter. The more to\r\nguard against rubbing, we had the _swingletree_ constructed so that\r\nthe trace-ropes came out from a hole in the ends, without any hook.\r\nIn harrowing the ground, one man is required to lead the horses, and\r\nanother to direct the harrows. In rich soil, under cultivation of green\r\ncrop, in this manner, trees progress very rapidly, and from the open\r\narrangement acquire very healthy constitutions. Of course, when not\r\nconiferæ, the plants require a little more attention to train to one\r\nleader and equality of feeders, than when close planted. We should\r\nconsider plough cultivation of young woods, provided ploughmen as\r\nexpert and careful as the Scots could be obtained, much more worthy the\r\nattention of the English planter than the Withers’ system (trenching).\r\nNeed we mention, that in green crop, every thing depends upon plenty of\r\nmanure and of well-timed plough and horse hoe labour? Excepting in the\r\ncase of larch, we should dread no injury to the trees or timber from\r\nplenty of manure.\r\n\r\n[66] We are indebted to our friend Mr Gorrie, Annat Garden, for the\r\nfact, that English acorns throw up a much more luxuriant stem than\r\nthe Scots; they forming a step of several inches when planted next\r\neach other in the nursery line. We should consider this to arise from\r\nthe largeness of the rudiments of the plant, and greater quantity of\r\ngarnered nourishment in the English acorns, which are nearly double\r\nthe size of the Scots, our present climate being insufficient for\r\nthe proper development. This leads to the question, will the greater\r\nluxuriance balance any tenderness from want of acclimatizing? Would the\r\noak keep its present locality in Scotland if left to nature? A careful\r\ninspection of the most elevated peat mosses in which remains of timber\r\nexist, and a comparison of the size of the seeds found there, with that\r\nof those of the present day, grown the nearest to this in situation,\r\nwould resolve the question of refrigeration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{363} APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\nIt is only on the _Ocean_ that _Universal Empire_ is practicable—only\r\nby means of _Navigation_ that all the world can be subdued or retained\r\nunder one dominion. On land, the greatest numbers, and quantity of\r\nmateriel, are unavailable, excepting around the spot where they are\r\nproduced. The most powerful army is crippled by advancing a few degrees\r\nin an enemy’s territory, unless when aided by some catching enthusiasm;\r\nits resources get distant—communication is obstructed—subjection\r\ndoes not extend beyond the range of its guns, and it quickly melts\r\naway. The impossibility of dominion extending over a great space,\r\nwhen communication is only by land, has often been proved. The rule\r\nof Cyrus, or Alexander, the Cæsars, the Tartar conquerors[67], or\r\nBonaparte, did not extend over a tithe of the earth; and we may\r\nbelieve, that, by some of these chiefs, dominion was {364} extended as\r\nwidely as under land communication could be effected—further than under\r\nit could be supported.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when a powerful nation has her warlike strength\r\nafloat, and possesses naval superiority, independent of being\r\nunassailable herself, every spot of the world, wherever a wave can\r\nroll, is accessible to her power and under her control. In a very short\r\ntime she can throw an irresistible force, unexhausted by marches, and\r\nwith every resource, upon any hostile point, the point of attack being\r\nin her own choice, and unknown to the enemy. In case of her dependent\r\ndominions being scattered over the two hemispheres, her means of\r\ncommunication, and consequent power of defending these and supporting\r\nauthority, are more facile than what exists between the seat of\r\ngovernment of any ordinary sized continental kingdom and its provinces.\r\nWere a popular system of colonial government adopted, many islands and\r\ninferior states would find it their interest to become incorporated as\r\npart of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE B.\r\n\r\nThere is a law universal in nature, tending to render every\r\nreproductive being the best possibly suited to its condition that\r\nits kind, or that organized matter, is susceptible of, which appears\r\nintended to model the physical and mental or instinctive powers, to\r\ntheir highest perfection, and to continue them so. This law sustains\r\nthe lion in his strength, the hare in her swiftness, and the {365}\r\nfox in his wiles. As Nature, in all her modifications of life, has a\r\npower of increase far beyond what is needed to supply the place of what\r\nfalls by Time’s decay, those individuals who possess not the requisite\r\nstrength, swiftness, hardihood, or cunning, fall prematurely without\r\nreproducing—either a prey to their natural devourers, or sinking under\r\ndisease, generally induced by want of nourishment, their place being\r\noccupied by the more perfect of their own kind, who are pressing on\r\nthe means of subsistence. The law of entail, necessary to hereditary\r\nnobility, is an outrage on this law of nature which she will not pass\r\nunavenged—a law which has the most debasing influence upon the energies\r\nof a people, and will sooner or later lead to general subversion, more\r\nespecially when the executive of a country remains for a considerable\r\ntime efficient, and no effort is needed on the part of the nobility to\r\nprotect their own, or no war to draw forth or preserve their powers\r\nby exertion. It is all very well, when, in stormy times, the baron\r\nhas every faculty trained to its utmost ability in keeping his proud\r\ncrest aloft. How far hereditary nobility, under effective government,\r\nhas operated to retard “the march of intellect,” and deteriorate the\r\nspecies in modern Europe, is an interesting and important question.\r\nWe have seen it play its part in France; we see exhibition of its\r\ninfluence throughout the Iberian peninsula, to the utmost degradation\r\nof its victims. It has rendered the Italian peninsula, with its\r\nislands, a blank in the political map of Europe. Let the panegyrists\r\nof hereditary nobility, primogeniture, and entail, say what these\r\ncountries might not have been {366} but for the baneful influence of\r\nthis unnatural custom. It is an eastern proverb, that no king is many\r\nremoves from a shepherd. Most conquerors and founders of dynasties\r\nhave followed the plough or the flock. Nobility, to be in the highest\r\nperfection, like the finer varieties of fruits, independent of having\r\nits vigour excited by regular married alliance with wilder stocks,\r\nwould require stated complete renovation, by selection anew, from among\r\nthe purest crab. In some places, this renovation would not be so soon\r\nrequisite as in others, and, judging from facts, we would instance\r\nBritain as perhaps the soil where nobility will continue the longest\r\nuntainted. As we advance nearer to the equator, renovation becomes\r\nsooner necessary, excepting at high elevation—in many places, every\r\nthird generation, at least with the Caucasian breed, although the\r\nfinest stocks be regularly imported. This renovation is required as\r\nwell physically as morally.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly in regard to the interval of time between the period of\r\nnecessary feudal authority, and that when the body of the population\r\nhaving acquired the power of self-government from the spread of\r\nknowledge, claim a community of rights, that we have adverted to the\r\nuse of war. The manufacturer, the merchant, the sailor, the capitalist,\r\nwhose mind is not corrupted by the indolence induced under the law of\r\nentail, are too much occupied to require any stimulant beyond what the\r\ngame in the wide field of commercial adventure affords. A great change\r\nin the circumstances of man is obviously at hand. {367} In the first\r\nstep beyond the condition of the wandering savage, while the lower\r\nclasses from ignorance remained as helpless children, mankind naturally\r\nfell into clans under paternal or feudal government; but as children,\r\nwhen grown up to maturity, with the necessity for protection, lose the\r\nsubordination to parental authority, so the great mass of the present\r\npopulation requiring no guidance from a particular class of feudal\r\nlords, will not continue to tolerate any hereditary claims of authority\r\nof one portion of the population over their fellow-men; nor any laws\r\nto keep up rank and wealth corresponding to this exclusive power.—It\r\nwould be _wisdom_ in the noblesse of Europe to abolish every claim or\r\nlaw which serves to point them out a separate class, and, as quickly as\r\npossible, to merge themselves into the mass of the population. It is\r\na law manifest in nature, that when the use of any thing is past, its\r\nexistence is no longer kept up.\r\n\r\nAlthough the necessity for the existence of feudal lords is past, yet\r\nthe same does not hold in respect to a hereditary head or King; and the\r\nstability of this head of the government will, in no way, be lessened\r\nby such a change. In the present state of European society, perhaps no\r\nother rule can be so mild and efficient as that of a liberal benevolent\r\nmonarch, assisted by a popular representative Parliament. The poorest\r\nman looks up to his king as his own, with affection and pride, and\r\nconsiders him a protector; while he only regards the antiquated feudal\r\nlord with contempt. The influence of a respected hereditary family,\r\nas head of a country, is also of great utility in {368} forming a\r\nprinciple of union to the different members, and in giving unity and\r\nstability to the government.\r\n\r\nIn respect to our own great landholders themselves, we would ask, where\r\nis there that unnatural parent—that miserable victim of hereditary\r\npride—who does not desire to see his domains equally divided among his\r\nown children? The high paid sinecures in church and state will not\r\nmuch longer be a great motive for keeping up a powerful family head,\r\nwhose influence may burthen their fellow-citizens with the younger\r\nbranches. Besides, when a portion of land is so large, that the owner\r\ncannot have an individual acquaintance and associations with every\r\nstream, and bush, and rock, and knoll, the deep enjoyment which the\r\nsmaller native proprietor would have in the peculiar features, is not\r\ncalled forth, and is lost to man. The abolition of the law of entail\r\nand primogeniture, will, in the present state of civilization, not\r\nonly add to the happiness of the proprietor, heighten morality, and\r\ngive much greater stability to the social order, but will also give a\r\ngeneral stimulus to industry and improvement, increasing the comforts\r\nand elevating the condition of the operative class.\r\n\r\nIn the new state of things which is near at hand, the proprietor and\r\nthe mercantile class will amalgamise,—employment in useful occupations\r\nwill not continue to be held in scorn,—the merchant and manufacturer\r\nwill no longer be barely tolerated to exist, harassed at every turn by\r\nimposts and the interference of petty tyrants;—Government, instead of\r\nforming an engine of oppression, being simplified and based on morality\r\nand justice, will {369} become a cheap and efficient protection to\r\nperson and property; and the necessary taxation being levied from\r\nproperty alone, every individual will purchase in the cheapest market,\r\nand sell the produce of his industry in the dearest. This period\r\nmight, perhaps, be accelerated throughout Europe, did the merchants\r\nand capitalists only know their own strength. Let them, as citizens of\r\nthe world, hold annual congress in some central place, and deliberate\r\non the interests of man, which is their own, and throw the whole of\r\ntheir influence to support liberal and just governments, and to repress\r\nslavery, crime, bigotry—tyranny in all shapes. A Rothschild might\r\nearn an unstained fame, as great as yet has been attained by man, by\r\norganizing such a power, and presiding at its councils.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE C.\r\n\r\nThe influence of long continued impression, constituting instinct or\r\nhabit of breed, is a curious phenomenon in the animal economy. Our\r\npopulation in the eastern maritime districts of Britain, descended\r\nprincipally from the Scandinavian rover, though devoted for a time\r\nto agricultural or mechanical occupation, betake themselves, when\r\nopportunity offers, to their old element, the ocean[68], {370} and\r\nlaunch out upon the “wintry wave” with much of the same home-felt\r\ncomposure as does the white polar bear. They roam over every sea and\r\nevery shore, from Behring’s Straits to Magellan’s, with as little\r\nsolicitude as the Kelt over his own misty hill, overcoming, in\r\nendurance, the native of the torrid zone under his vertical sun, and\r\nthe native of the frigid among his polar snows.\r\n\r\nTo what may we ascribe the superiority of this portion of the Caucasian\r\nbreed,—may it arise in part from its repeated change of place under\r\nfavourable circumstances? Other races have migrated, but not like this,\r\nalways as conqueror. The Jew has been a stroller in his time; but he\r\nhas improved more in mental acumen and cunning—not so much in heroism\r\nand personal qualities: his proscribed condition will account for this.\r\nThe Caucasian in its progress, will also have mingled slightly, and,\r\njudging from analogy, perhaps advantageously, with the finer portion\r\nof those whom it has overwhelmed. This breed, by its wide move across\r\nthe Atlantic, does not seem at all to have lost vigour, and retains\r\nthe nautical and roving instinct unimpaired, although the American\r\nclimate is certainly inferior to the European. It is there rapidly\r\nmoving west, and may soon have described one of the earth’s circles.\r\nA change of seed, that is, a change of place, within certain limits\r\nof latitude, is well known {371} to be indispensable to the more\r\nsturdy growth and health of many cultivated vegetables; it is probable\r\nthat this also holds true of the human race. There are few countries\r\nwhere the old breed has not again and again sunk before the vigour of\r\nnew immigration; we even see the worn out breed, chased from their\r\nhomes to new location, return, after a time, superior to their former\r\nvanquishers, or gradually work their way back in peace, by superior\r\nsubsisting power: this is visible in France, where the aboriginal\r\nsallow Kelt, distinguished by high satyr-like feature, deep-placed\r\nsparkling brown or grey eye, narrowed lower part of the face, short\r\nerect vertebral column, great mental acuteness, and restless vivacity,\r\nhas emerged from the holes of the earth, the recesses of the forests\r\nand wastes, into which it had been swept before the more powerful\r\nblue-eyed Caucasian; and being a smaller, more easily subsisting\r\nanimal, has, by starving and eating out, been gradually undermining\r\nthe breed of its former conquerors. The changes which have been taking\r\nplace in France, and which, in many places, leave now scarcely a trace\r\nof the fine race which existed twenty centuries ago, may, however, in\r\npart, be accounted for by the admixture of the Caucasian and Keltic\r\ntending more to the character of the latter, from the latter being a\r\npurer and more fixed variety, and nearer the original type or medium\r\nstandard of man; and from the warm dry plains of France (much drier\r\nfrom cultivation and the reduction of the forests), having considerable\r\ninfluence to increase this bias: In some of the south-eastern\r\ndepartments, {372} more immediately in the tide of the ingress of the\r\nCaucasian, where the purest current has latest flowed, and the climate\r\nis more suitable, and also in some of the maritime districts, where the\r\nair is moister, and to which they have been seaborn at a later period,\r\nthe Caucasian character is still prominent. Something of this, yet not\r\nso general, is occurring in Britain, where the fair bright-blooded race\r\nis again giving place to the darker and more sallow. This may, however,\r\nbe partly occasioned by more of artificial heat and shelter and other\r\nconsequences of higher civilization. There seems to be something\r\nconnected with confinement and sedentary life, with morbid action of\r\nthe liver, or respiratory or transpiratory organs, which tends to this\r\nchange under dry and hot, and especially confined atmosphere. Perhaps\r\nimagination is also a worker here; and the colour most regarded, as\r\nsnow in cold countries, black among colliers, white among bleachers,\r\nor even the dark colour of dress, may produce its peculiar impression,\r\nand our much looked-up-to Calvinistic priesthood, from the pulpit,\r\ndisseminate darkness as well as light.\r\n\r\nOur own Kelt has indubitably improved much since, _par necessité_,\r\nhe took to the mountain; but, though steadily enduring, when there\r\nis mental excitement, he has acquired a distaste to dull hopeless\r\nunceasing labour, and would fare scantily and lie hard, rather than\r\nsubmit to the monotonous industry of the city operative, or the toil of\r\nthe agricultural drudge. Though once a fugitive, the Kelt is now, in\r\nmoral courage and hardihood, equal {373} perhaps to any other, yet he\r\nstill trembles to put foot on ocean.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that change of place, simply, may have impression\r\nto improve the species, yet is it more to circumstances connected\r\nwith this change, to which the chief part of the improvement must be\r\nreferred. In the agitation which accompanies emigration, the ablest\r\nin mind and body—the most powerful varieties of the race will be\r\nthrown into their natural position as leaders, impressing the stamp\r\nof their character on the people at large, and constituting the more\r\nreproductive part; while the feebler or more improvident varieties will\r\ngenerally sink under the incidental hardships. When a swarm emigrates\r\nfrom a prosperous hive, it also will generally consist of the more\r\nadventurous stirring spirits, who, with the right of conquerors, will\r\nappropriate the finest of the indigenæ which they overrun; their choice\r\nof these being regulated by personal qualities, not by the adventitious\r\ncircumstances of wealth or high birth—a regard to which certainly tends\r\nto deteriorate the species, and is one of the causes which renders the\r\nnoblesse of Europe comparatively inferior to the Asiatic, or rather the\r\nChristian noblesse to the Mahometan.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked, that our finest, most acute population, exist in\r\nthe neutral ground, where the Caucasian and Keltic have mixed, but this\r\nmay arise from other causes than admixture. Our healthiest and poorest\r\ncountry borders the Highlands, and the population enjoy more of the\r\nopen air. Our eastern population, north of the {374} natural division\r\nof Flamboroughead, are also harder and sharper featured, and keener\r\nwitted, than those southward, who may be styled our fen-bred. There is\r\nno doubt more of Keltic blood mingled with the north division; but the\r\nsea-born breeds have also been different, those more northerly being\r\nScandinavian, and the more southerly consisting of the native of Lower\r\nGermany and the heavy Fleming. The placid-looking Englishman, more\r\nunder the control of animal enjoyment, though perhaps not so readily\r\nacute, excels in the no less valuable qualities of constancy and bodily\r\npowers of exertion; and when properly taught under high division of\r\nlabour, becomes a better operative in his particular employment, and\r\neven will sometimes extend scientific discovery further, than his\r\nmore mercurial northern neighbour, who, from his quick wits being\r\ngenerally in advance of his manual practice, seldom attains to the\r\ndexterity which results from the combination of continued bodily\r\naction and restricted mental application. There exists, however, very\r\nconsiderable intellectual capacity in this English breed, but it too\r\nfrequently is crushed under the preponderance of the animal part,\r\naffording that purest specimen of vulgarity, the English clown. But,\r\nindependently of climate and breed, a great part of the low Englander’s\r\nobtuseness is referable to his being entailed lord of the soil, under\r\npoor-rate law, contravening a natural law (see note B), so that, when\r\nunsuccessful or out of employment, he, without effort to obtain some\r\nnew means of independent subsistence, sinks into the parish {375} or\r\nwork-house labourer. On the contrary, the Scotsman, with no resource\r\nbut in himself, with famine always in the vista, as much in his view\r\nas a principle of action in material affairs as his strong perception\r\nof the right in moral, and also under the stimulus of a high pride,\r\nleaves no means untried at home; and, when fairly starved out of his\r\nnative country, among various resources, often invades the territory\r\nof his more easy-minded southern neighbour, where his acuteness seldom\r\nfails to find out a convenient occupation, in which manual dexterity is\r\nsecond to economy and forethought—his success exciting the wonder and\r\nenvy of the dull-witted native.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, that the finest portion, at least apparently so,\r\nof the north temperate zone, between the parallels of 30° and 48°\r\nlatitude, when nearly of the level of the ocean, is not so favourable\r\nfor human existence as the more northern part between 50° and 60°,\r\nor even the torrid zone. The native of the north of Europe has a\r\nsuperior development of person, and a much longer reproductory life\r\nthan the native of the south, which more than counterbalances the\r\nearlier maturity of the latter in power of increase. Independent of\r\nthe great current of population setting south in the northern part of\r\nthe temperate zone, there seems even to be some tendency to a flux\r\nnorthward, from the confines of the torrid; but this arises rather from\r\nthe unsteadiness of the seasons, and consequent deficit of food, at\r\nparticular times, than from a steady increase of population. {376}\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE D, p. 4.\r\n\r\nOur milder moods, benevolence, gentleness, contemplation—our refinement\r\nin sentiment—our “lovely dreams of peace and joy,” have negative\r\nweight in the balance of national strength. The rougher excitement of\r\nhatred, ambition, pride, patriotism, and the more selfish passions,\r\nis necessary to the full and strong development of our active powers.\r\nThat Britain is leaving the impress of her energy and morality on a\r\nconsiderable portion of the world, is owing to her having first borne\r\nfire and sword over these countries: the husbandman tears up the glebe,\r\nwith all its covering of weeds and flowers, before he commit his good\r\nseed to the earth. Life and death—good and evil—pleasure and pain, are\r\nthe principles of impulse to the scheme or machine of nature, as heat\r\nand cold are to the steam-engine, thus moving in necessary alternate\r\ndependence. Our moral sense, our perception and love of good, could not\r\nexist without the knowledge of evil; yet, we shudder at the truth of\r\nevil being part and portion of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE E.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a more striking proof of the necessity of a better\r\nrepresentation of the marine interest, than the fact, that our trading\r\nvessels are constructed of an {377} unsuitable figure, owing to the\r\nimproper manner of measuring the register tonnage. In order to save a\r\nlittle trouble of calculation to the surveying officer in gauging the\r\ncontents of the vessel, the law directs him merely to take the length\r\nand breadth at the widest place, and from these lines, by a regular\r\nformula, to compute the tonnage; the vessel paying the charges for\r\nlights and harbours, and other dues, in proportion to this measurement.\r\nThe result is, that, in order to lessen these dues individually, our\r\nvessels are constructed deep in proportion to breadth, consequently are\r\nsluggish sailers, and not nearly so safe and pleasant sea-boats as they\r\notherwise would be—many a ship, especially with light cargo, getting\r\non her beam-ends and foundering, or not standing up under canvass to\r\nweather a lee shore. The influence of this absurd measurement law is\r\nthe more unlucky, as the ship-owner, from a deep vessel being, in\r\nproportion to the capacity of the hold, cheaper than one of shallower\r\nor longer dimensions, is already more disposed to construct his vessel\r\ndeeper than is consistent with the safety of the seamen and security\r\nof the ship and cargo, the particular insurance of a deep vessel not\r\nbeing greater than that of one of safer proportions. The injurious\r\neffect from vessels being constructed on the principles of avoiding\r\ntolls or dues, rather than for sailing, will occur to every one. We\r\nneed not say that all this flows from the ignorance or carelessness of\r\nthe constructors of our Parliamentary acts, consequent to defective\r\nrepresentation. {378}\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE F.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the upper carse on the Tay Firth, there is evidence,\r\nboth from its vestiges and from records, that it had occupied, at\r\nleast, the entire firth, or sea-basin, above Broughty Ferry, and\r\nthat about 50 square miles of this carse has been carried out into\r\nthe German Ocean by the strong sea-tide current, a consequence of\r\nthe lowering of the German Ocean, and of the deepening of the outlet\r\nof this sea-basin at Broughty Ferry, apparently by this very rapid\r\nsea-tide current. This carse appears to have been a general deposition\r\nat the bottom of a lake having only a narrow outlet communicating with\r\nthe sea, and probably did not rise much higher than the height of the\r\nbottom of the outlet at that time.\r\n\r\nAn increase of deposition of alluvium, or prevention of decrease, may,\r\nin many cases, be accomplished by artificial means. The diminution of\r\nthe carse of the Tay was in rapid progress about sixty years ago, the\r\nsea-bank being undermined by the waves of the basin, the clay tumbling\r\ndown, becoming diffused in the water, and being carried out to sea,\r\nby every ebbing tide, purer water returning from the ocean the next\r\ntide-flow. This decrease was stopped by the adoption of stone embanking\r\nand dikes. A small extension of the carses of present high-water level,\r\nin the upper part of the firths of Tay and Forth, has lately been\r\neffected, by forming brushwood, stone and mud dikes, to promote the\r\naccumulation. {379} In doing this, the whole art consists in placing\r\nobstructions to the current and waves, so that whatever deposition\r\ntakes place at high-water, or at the beginning of the flood-tide, when\r\nthe water is nearly still, may not again be raised and carried off.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this accumulation, and also the prevention of further\r\nwaste of the superior carse, the deepening of the Tay Firth, formerly\r\ncarse, and of the gorge at Broughty Ferry, seems still in progress,\r\nand could not, without very considerable labour, be prevented. In the\r\ncase, however, of the sea-basin of Montrose, a little labour, from\r\nthe narrowness of the gorges, would put it in a condition to become\r\ngradually filled with mud. Not a great deal more expenditure than what\r\nhas sufficed to erect the suspension-bridge over its largest outlet,\r\nwould have entirely filled up this outlet, and the smaller outlet\r\nmight have been also filled to within several feet of high-water, and\r\nmade of sufficient breadth only, to emit the water of the river, which\r\nflows into the basin. The floated sand and mud of this river, thus\r\nprevented from being carried out to sea, would, in the course of years,\r\ncompletely fill up the basin.\r\n\r\nFrom some vestiges of the upper carse, as well as of the lower or\r\nsubmarine carse, in situations where their formation cannot easily be\r\ntraced to any local cause, it seems not improbable that the basin of\r\nthe German sea itself, nearly as far north as the extent of Scotland,\r\nhad at one time been occupied with a carse or delta, a continuation\r\nof Holland, formed by the accumulation of the {380} diluvium of the\r\nrivers which flow into this basin, together with the molluscous exuviæ\r\nof the North Sea, and the abrasion of the Norwegian coast and Scottish\r\nislands, borne downward by the heavy North Sea swell.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the delta of Holland having extended so far northward,\r\na subsidence of the land or rising of the sea, so as to form a passage\r\nfor the waters round Britain, must have occurred. The derangement,\r\nat several places, of the fine wavy stratification of these carses,\r\nand the confusedly heaped-up beds of broken sea-shells, shew that\r\nsome great rush of water had taken place, probably when Belgium was\r\ndissevered from England. Since the opening of the bottom of the gulf,\r\nthe accumulation may have been undergoing a gradual reduction, by\r\nmore diffused mud[69] being carried off from the German Sea into\r\nthe Atlantic and North Sea, than what the former is receiving—the\r\nsame process taking place here as has been occurring in the basin\r\nof the Tay. The large sand-banks on the Dutch and English coast,—in\r\nsome places, such as the Goodwin Sands, certainly the heavier, less\r\ndiffusible part of the former alluvial country, and portions of these\r\nalluvial districts being retained by artificial means,—bear a striking\r\nresemblance to the {381} sand-banks of the sea basin of the Tay—the\r\nless diffusible remains of the removed portion of the alluvium which\r\nhad once occupied all that basin, and to the remaining portion of the\r\nalluvium also retained by artificial means.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThroughout this volume, we have felt considerable inconvenience, from\r\nthe adopted dogmatical classification of plants, and have all along\r\nbeen floundering between species and variety, which certainly under\r\nculture soften into each other. A particular conformity, each after\r\nits own kind, when in a state of nature, termed species, no doubt\r\nexists to a considerable degree. This conformity has existed during\r\nthe last forty centuries. Geologists discover a like particular\r\nconformity—fossil species—through the deep deposition of each great\r\nepoch, but they also discover an almost complete difference to exist\r\nbetween the species or stamp of life, of one epoch from that of every\r\nother. We are therefore led to admit, either of a repeated miraculous\r\ncreation; or of a power of change, under a change of circumstances,\r\nto belong to living organized matter, or rather to the congeries of\r\ninferior life, which appears to form superior. The derangements and\r\nchanges in organized existence, induced by a change of circumstance\r\nfrom the interference of man, affording us {382} proof of the plastic\r\nquality of superior life, and the likelihood that circumstances have\r\nbeen very different in the different epochs, though steady in each,\r\ntend strongly to heighten the probability of the latter theory.\r\n\r\nWhen we view the immense calcareous and bituminous formations,\r\nprincipally from the waters and atmosphere, and consider the oxidations\r\nand depositions which have taken place, either gradually, or during\r\nsome of the great convulsions, it appears at least probable, that the\r\nliquid elements containing life have varied considerably at different\r\ntimes in composition and in weight; that our atmosphere has contained\r\na much greater proportion of carbonic acid or oxygen; and our waters,\r\naided by excess of carbonic acid, and greater heat resulting from\r\ngreater density of atmosphere, have contained a greater quantity of\r\nlime and other mineral solutions. Is the inference then unphilosophic,\r\nthat living things which are proved to have a circumstance-suiting\r\npower—a very slight change of circumstance by culture inducing a\r\ncorresponding change of character—may have gradually accommodated\r\nthemselves to the variations of the elements containing them, and,\r\nwithout new creation, have presented the diverging changeable phenomena\r\nof past and present organized existence.\r\n\r\nThe destructive liquid currents, before which the hardest mountains\r\nhave been swept and comminuted into gravel, sand, and mud, which\r\nintervened between and divided these epochs, probably extending over\r\nthe whole surface of the globe, and destroying nearly all living {383}\r\nthings, must have reduced existence so much, that an unoccupied field\r\nwould be formed for new diverging ramifications of life, which, from\r\nthe connected sexual system of vegetables, and the natural instincts\r\nof animals to herd and combine with their own kind, would fall into\r\nspecific groups, these remnants, in the course of time, moulding and\r\naccommodating their being anew to the change of circumstances, and\r\nto every possible means of subsistence, and the millions of ages of\r\nregularity which appear to have followed between the epochs, probably\r\nafter this accommodation was completed, affording fossil deposit of\r\nregular specific character.\r\n\r\nThere are only two probable ways of change—the above, and the still\r\nwider deviation from present occurrence,—of indestructible or molecular\r\nlife (which seems to resolve itself into powers of attraction and\r\nrepulsion under mathematical figure and regulation, bearing a slight\r\nsystematic similitude to the great aggregations of matter), gradually\r\nuniting and developing itself into new circumstance-suited living\r\naggregates, without the presence of any mould or germ of former\r\naggregates, but this scarcely differs from new creation, only it forms\r\na portion of a continued scheme or system.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to trace, in the former way, the principle of these\r\nchanges of fashion which have taken place in the domiciles of life,\r\nthe following questions occur: Do they arise from admixture of\r\nspecies nearly allied producing intermediate species? Are they _the\r\ndiverging ramifications_ of the living principle under modification\r\nof {384} circumstance? Or have they resulted from the combined\r\nagency of both? Is there only one living principle? Does organized\r\nexistence, and perhaps all material existence, consist of one Proteus\r\nprinciple of life capable of gradual circumstance-suited modifications\r\nand aggregations, without bound under the solvent or motion-giving\r\nprinciple, heat or light? There is more beauty and unity of design\r\nin this continual balancing of life to circumstance, and greater\r\nconformity to those dispositions of nature which are manifest to us,\r\nthan in total destruction and new creation. It is improbable that\r\nmuch of this diversification is owing to commixture of species nearly\r\nallied, all change by this appears very limited, and confined within\r\nthe bounds of what is called Species; the progeny of the same parents,\r\nunder great difference of circumstance, might, in several generations,\r\neven become distinct species, incapable of co-reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe self-regulating adaptive disposition of organized life may, in\r\npart, be traced to the extreme fecundity of Nature, who, as before\r\nstated, has, in all the varieties of her offspring, a prolific power\r\nmuch beyond (in many cases a thousandfold) what is necessary to fill\r\nup the vacancies caused by senile decay. As the field of existence\r\nis limited and pre-occupied, it is only the hardier, more robust,\r\nbetter suited to circumstance individuals, who are able to struggle\r\nforward to maturity, these inhabiting only the situations to which\r\nthey have superior adaptation and greater power of occupancy than\r\nany other kind; the weaker, less circumstance-suited, being {385}\r\nprematurely destroyed. This principle is in constant action, it\r\nregulates the colour, the figure, the capacities, and instincts; those\r\nindividuals of each species, whose colour and covering are best suited\r\nto concealment or protection from enemies, or defence from vicissitude\r\nand inclemencies of climate, whose figure is best accommodated to\r\nhealth, strength, defence, and support; whose capacities and instincts\r\ncan best regulate the physical energies to self-advantage according\r\nto circumstances—in such immense waste of primary and youthful life,\r\n_those_ only come forward to maturity from the strict ordeal by which\r\nNature tests their adaptation to her standard of perfection and fitness\r\nto continue their kind by reproduction.\r\n\r\nFrom the unremitting operation of this law acting in concert with\r\nthe tendency which the progeny have to take the more particular\r\nqualities of the parents, together with the connected sexual system in\r\nvegetables, and instinctive limitation to its own kind in animals, a\r\nconsiderable uniformity of figure, colour, and character, is induced,\r\nconstituting species; the breed gradually acquiring the very best\r\npossible adaptation of these to its condition which it is susceptible\r\nof, and when alteration of circumstance occurs, thus changing in\r\ncharacter to suit these as far as its nature is susceptible of change.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance-adaptive law, operating upon the slight but continued\r\nnatural disposition to sport in the progeny (seedling variety), does\r\nnot preclude the supposed influence which volition or sensation may\r\nhave over the configuration of the body. To examine into the {386}\r\ndisposition to sport in the progeny, even when there is only one\r\nparent, as in many vegetables, and to investigate how much variation\r\nis modified by the mind or nervous sensation of the parents, or of the\r\nliving thing itself during its progress to maturity; how far it depends\r\nupon external circumstance, and how far on the will, irritability and\r\nmuscular exertion, is open to examination and experiment. In the first\r\nplace, we ought to investigate its dependency upon the preceding links\r\nof the particular chain of life, variety being often merely types or\r\napproximations of former parentage; thence the variation of the family,\r\nas well as of the individual, must be embraced by our experiments.\r\n\r\nThis continuation of family type, not broken by casual particular\r\naberration, is mental as well as corporeal, and is exemplified in many\r\nof the dispositions or instincts of particular races of men. These\r\ninnate or continuous ideas or habits, seem proportionally greater\r\nin the insect tribes, those especially of shorter revolution; and\r\nforming an abiding memory, may resolve much of the enigma of instinct,\r\nand the foreknowledge which these tribes have of what is necessary\r\nto completing their round of life, reducing this to knowledge, or\r\nimpressions, and habits, acquired by a long experience. This greater\r\ncontinuity of existence, or rather continuity of perceptions and\r\nimpressions, in insects, is highly probable; it is even difficult\r\nin some to ascertain the particular stops when each individuality\r\ncommences, under the different phases of egg, larva, pupa, or if much\r\n{387} consciousness of individuality exists. The continuation of\r\nreproduction for several generations by the females alone in some of\r\nthese tribes, tends to the probability of the greater continuity of\r\nexistence, and the subdivisions of life by cuttings, at any rate must\r\nstagger the advocate of individuality.\r\n\r\nAmong the millions of _specific varieties_ of living things which\r\noccupy the humid portion of the surface of our planet, as far back\r\nas can be traced, there does not appear, with the exception of man,\r\nto have been any particular engrossing race, but a pretty fair\r\nbalance of powers of occupancy,—or rather, most wonderful variation\r\nof circumstance parallel to the nature of every species, as if\r\ncircumstance and species had grown up together. There are indeed\r\nseveral races which have threatened ascendency in some particular\r\nregions, but it is man alone from whom any general imminent danger to\r\nthe existence of his brethren is to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nAs far back as history reaches, man had already had considerable\r\ninfluence, and had made encroachments upon his fellow denizens,\r\nprobably occasioning the destruction of many species, and the\r\nproduction and continuation of a number of varieties or even species,\r\nwhich he found more suited to supply his wants, but which, from the\r\ninfirmity of their condition—not having undergone selection by the\r\nlaw of nature, of which we have spoken, cannot maintain their ground\r\nwithout his culture and protection.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, only in the present age that man has {388} begun\r\nto reap the fruits of his tedious education, and has proven how\r\nmuch “knowledge is power.” He has now acquired a dominion over the\r\nmaterial world, and a consequent power of increase, so as to render it\r\nprobable that the whole surface of the earth may soon be overrun by\r\nthis engrossing anomaly, to the annihilation of every wonderful and\r\nbeautiful variety of animated existence, which does not administer to\r\nhis wants principally as laboratories of preparation to befit cruder\r\nelemental matter for assimilation by his organs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn taking a retrospective glance at our pages from the press, we notice\r\nsome inaccuracy and roughness, which a little more timely attention to\r\n_training_ and _pruning_ might have obviated; the facts and induction\r\nmay, however, outbalance these.\r\n\r\nWe observe that Fig. _d_, p. 27, from the want of proper shading,\r\nand error in not marking the dotted lines, does not serve well to\r\nillustrate our purpose. This figure is intended to represent a tree\r\nof a short thick stem, dividing into four branches, springing out\r\nregularly in the manner of a cross, nearly at right angles with the\r\nstem. These branches cut over about three or four feet out from the\r\ndivision, form each one wing of a knee, and the stem, quartered\r\nlongitudinally through the heart, forms the other wing. It is of great\r\nadvantage to have four branches rather than two or three, as the stem,\r\ndivided into four, by being twice cut down the middle, forms the wings\r\nnearly square; whereas, when divided {389} into two, the halves are\r\nbroad and flat, and a considerable loss of timber takes place; besides,\r\nthe two branches afford a thicker wing than the flat half of the stem\r\ndoes when squared. When the tree separates into three branches, the\r\nstem does not saw out conveniently; and when divided, the cleft part\r\nis angular, and much loss of timber also takes place in the squaring.\r\nWhen the stem divides into four branches, each of these branches\r\ncoincides in thickness with the quartered stem, and the knees are\r\nobtained equally thick throughout, without any loss of timber. The four\r\nbranches, at six or eight feet above the division, may with a little\r\nattention be thrown into a rectangular bend, and thus give eight knees\r\nfrom each tree. Knees are generally required of about eight inches in\r\ndiameter, and three and a half feet in length of wing; but when they\r\nare to be had thicker and longer, a foot or more in thickness, and\r\nfrom four to ten feet in length of wing, they are equally in request,\r\nsuiting for high rising floors or heel-knees.\r\n\r\nThe directions for forming larch roots into knees after the tree is\r\ngrubbed, are also not very explicit. The stem of the tree is cut over\r\nnearly the same distance from the bulb as the length of the root spurs;\r\nthis quartered through the heart (in the same manner as above), forms\r\none wing of the knee, and the four spurs form the other wings. The\r\nsame advantage results from having four regular root-spurs in larch,\r\nas in having four regular branches in oak: the two processes are quite\r\nsimilar, only the roots in the one case, and the branches in the other,\r\nform one wing of the knees. {390}\r\n\r\nWe have given no directions for the bending of plank timber. In larch,\r\nthe wind generally gives the slight necessary bend to a sufficient\r\nproportion; and in oak, the trees frequently grow a little bent of\r\ntheir own accord.\r\n\r\nA foot-note has been omitted, stating, that the plan of bending young\r\ntrees, by tying them to an adjacent tree, intended to be soon removed,\r\nbelongs, as we are informed, to Mr Loudon.\r\n\r\nWe regret that our allusion to the lamented Mr Huskisson was printed\r\noff before we knew of his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince this volume went to press, there has been some changes of\r\nscenery on the political European stage, _even rivalling_ what has\r\never been accomplished of sylvan metamorphosis on the face of nature\r\nby Sir Henry Steuart. The intense interest excited by these efforts\r\ntowards the regeneration of man, has completely thrown into shade our\r\nhumbler subject—the regeneration of trees. We have even forgot it\r\nourselves in the hands of the printer, while yet unborn. These sudden\r\ntransformations altering the political and moral relations of man,\r\nalso render a number of our observations not quite apposite, and our\r\nspeculations, some of them, rather “prophetic of the past.” They, by\r\nobliterating national distinctions, and diminishing the occasions for\r\ngoing to war, will, it is hoped, bring the European family closer\r\ninto amity. At any rate, they have completely thrown out the {391}\r\ncalculations of our politicians regarding the balance of power and\r\ninternational connection as natural allies and foes, and bind the\r\nFrench and the British together by ties on the surest principle of\r\nfriendly sympathy, “_idem velle atque nolle_,” which no Machiavellian\r\npolicy of cabinets, nor waywardness of political head, will be able to\r\nsunder.\r\n\r\nWe had intended to bring out Naval Timber and Arboriculture as a\r\nportion of a work embracing Rural Economy in general, but this is not a\r\ntime to think of rural affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDNOTES TO THE APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n[67] The very extended sway, the state of civilization considered,\r\nof the Tartar, was evidently the consequence of the great facility\r\nof communication from the plain open surface of the country, and the\r\nequestrian habits of the people.\r\n\r\n[68] The habit of breed is apparent in many places of the world. Where\r\na fine river washes the walls of some of the internal towns of France,\r\nscarce a boat is to be seen, except the long tract-boats employed in\r\nthe conveyance of fire-wood—nobody thinks of sailing for pleasure. The\r\nEsquimaux, and the Red Indian of North America, inhabiting the same\r\ncountry, shew an entirely distinct habit of breed. The Black and the\r\nCopper-coloured native of the Australian Islands, are equally opposed\r\nin instinctive habit.\r\n\r\n[69] The sea water from Flamborough-head, southward to the Straits\r\nof Dover, is generally discoloured with mud; and during every breeze\r\ntakes up an addition from the bottom, which is an alluvium so unstable\r\nand loose, that no sea vegetation can hold in it. From not producing\r\nherbage, the general basis of animal life, few fishes or shells can\r\nfind support in it.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n Page 10, top line, _for_ they _read_ the branches\r\n      18, line 13. from bottom, _for_ under _read_ within\r\n      18, line 8. from bottom, _for_ long _read_ in length of wing\r\n      22, _insert_ f _at fig. on right-hand side of wood cut_.\r\n      26, line 8. from bottom, _for_ 5 _read_ 3\r\n      57, line 4. from top, _for_ any _read_ many\r\n      78, line 11. from top, _for_ latitude _read_ altitude\r\n      87, line 9. from top, _dele_ may also in some degree\r\n      —, line 10. from top, _for_ diminish _read_ diminishing\r\n      —, line 11. from top, _for_ increase _read_ increasing\r\n     205, line 12. from top, _dele_ generally esteemed\r\n     206, bottom line, _for_ lineal _read_ large\r\n     218, line 5. from bottom, _for_ ground _read_ portion\r\n     220, line 7. from bottom, _after_ soil _insert a semicolon_\r\n     222, line 14. from top, _for_ latterly _read_ laterally\r\n     223, line 13. from top, _for_ falling _read_ felling\r\n     242, line 12. from top, _for_ into _read_ in, to\r\n     280, line 14. from top, _for_ the _read_ this\r\n     285, top line, _after_ n _insert_ o\r\n     300, line 2. from bottom, _dele_ of\r\n     327, line 6. from bottom, _for_ that dew, _read_ dew, that\r\n     331, line 10. from bottom, _for_ root _read_ row\r\n     372, line 14. from top, _for_ tend _read_ tends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTE.\r\n\r\nOriginal spelling and grammar have been generally retained, with some\r\nexceptions noted below.
