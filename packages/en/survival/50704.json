HAMMOND HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Society:_\r\n\r\nWhen I was invited to address this society I had no material at hand on\r\nthe subject. I have come to the east without any notes or memoranda\r\nwhatever, from which to prepare a lecture or address, no statistical\r\ndata which would make a paper valuable, no notes of characteristic\r\nfacts to render an address interesting, and no time to write anything\r\nto guide me in any way to a proper treatment of the subject. Some of\r\nyour members have thought that I have written something worthy of being\r\nread, and hence this invitation to address you. But, even if they are\r\nright, people who can write cannot always talk, so if I fail in this\r\naddress, I shall hope, on the basis of their opinion, that you will\r\nfind in the reports I have written something worthy of reading. The\r\nsubject has been announced as the \"Problems of Irrigation in the United\r\nStates.\" I should like very much to speak broadly on that subject, but\r\nI am unable to do so, for the reasons I have given, and shall have to\r\nspeak rather of irrigation in California, trusting that something which\r\nis said, may, perchance, be valuable in relation to the subject at\r\nlarge. Irrigation in the far west, generally, is attracting a vast deal\r\nof attention. This is particularly the case on the Pacific Coast--the\r\nfield with which I am specially acquainted. I apprehend that although\r\nmany gentlemen present have a far-reaching and definite appreciation of\r\nthe subject at large, many others do not appreciate the value and\r\nimportance of irrigation. In the arid parts of California (for we do\r\nnot admit that California is as a whole arid) it is a vital matter.\r\nThere it is a question of life, for the people. Not more than one-sixth\r\nof the tillable area in the State can sustain a really dense\r\npopulation, without irrigation; two thirds of it will not sustain even\r\na moderate population, without irrigation; while one third will not\r\nsustain even a sparse population, without such artificial watering.\r\nThink well over these facts. They are very significant. I doubt whether\r\nthey are generally appreciated in California itself.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt many persons are familiar with the geography of the\r\nState, but, doubtless, some are not. California has a coast line of 800\r\nmiles and a width of from 140 to 240 miles. It is traversed almost\r\nthroughout its length by a great mountain chain extending along near\r\nthe eastern boundary, which is called the Sierra Nevada, and by a\r\nlesser range, more broken and less unified, running parallel to the\r\ncoast, called the Coast Range, the southern extension of which, after\r\njoining the Sierra Nevada, is called the Sierra Madre, and at the\r\nfurther extremity, the San Jacinto and San Diego mountains. Within the\r\ninterior of the State, looked down upon by the Sierra Nevada on the\r\neast, and closed in by the Coast Range on the west, is the great\r\ninterior basin--the valley of the San Joaquin and Sacramento\r\nrivers--forming a plain 450 miles long, with an average width of from\r\n40 to 60 miles. Outside of the Sierra Madre in the southern part of the\r\nState, and within the Coast Range, is another interior valley, nearly\r\n100 miles in length and from 20 to 30 miles in width, and outside of\r\nthe Coast Range, and lying next to the ocean, is a plain whose length\r\nis from 60 to 70 miles, and width 15 to 20 miles. These three\r\nareas--the great interior valley, the southern interior valley, and the\r\ncoast plain of the south--are the principal irrigation regions of the\r\nState. Numbers of smaller areas, as those in San Diego county, come in\r\nas irrigation regions of less importance, and the scattering valleys\r\nalong the Coast Range farther north, as the Salinas, etc., will come\r\nforward in the future as important irrigable districts of the State.\r\nStill further north, in the interior, there are the great plains of\r\nLassen and Mono counties, and some scattering valleys in Shasta county,\r\nwhere irrigation is also practiced or is being introduced, and these\r\nare on a par with the districts of San Diego county, in the matter of\r\nrank as irrigation regions. East of the Sierra Nevada, and at their\r\nbase, lies the Owen's river country, an area suitable for irrigation,\r\nwhere irrigation is necessary and where it is being introduced. Upon\r\nthe great Mojave desert and the Colorado desert, there is at present no\r\nirrigation. The water supply is very scanty. This is an irrigation\r\nregion of the future, but it is not regarded by Californians as a\r\npracticable one at present.\r\n\r\nWith this general idea of the State, we will now look at the rainfall\r\nand water supply. The State contains 157,440 square miles of territory,\r\nof which 17,747 drain into the ocean north of the Golden Gate, 21,665\r\ndrain into the ocean south of the Golden Gate, 55,942 drain into the\r\ninterior basins, and 62,086 drain out at the Golden Gate. Of this\r\nterritory which drains out by the Golden Gate, 26,187 square miles\r\ncomprise the Sacramento valley, 31,895 square miles the San Joaquin\r\nvalley, and 4,004 the country draining directly to the bays, making the\r\n62,086 given above as the whole area.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for irrigation in California, and the relative necessity\r\nin different parts of the State, are shown by the distribution of\r\nrainfall. The San Joaquin valley has an average of less than 10 inches\r\nof rainfall, the Sacramento has an average of between 10 and 20 inches.\r\nThe great deserts of the Mojave and Colorado have an average of less\r\nthan 10 inches, and in certain localities only 3 to 6 inches. The\r\nSalinas valley, a small portion of the coast above Los Angeles, and a\r\nportion of the interior valley of the south, have also an average of\r\nless than 10 inches.\r\n\r\nSo, we may say, that the great irrigation regions of California have\r\naverage amounts of rainfall varying from about 6 up to 20, but\r\ngenerally less than 10 inches. This rain is distributed in four or five\r\nmonths of each year, with some slight showers in one or two months\r\nother than these; the remainder of the year being absolutely dry, with\r\nno rainfall whatever. Hence, you will see at once, the necessity for\r\nthe artificial application of water in California. In the older\r\ncountries of Europe, where irrigation has been practiced for centuries,\r\nfor instance, in Spain, where water is used more extensively than in\r\nCalifornia, the annual mean rainfall ranges between 10 and 25 inches.\r\nIn the irrigation regions of France, the mean rainfall ranges from 10\r\nto 40 inches; in the irrigation regions of Italy, the rainfall is\r\nbetween 20 and 35 inches--for instance, in the valley of the Po, the\r\nclassic land of irrigation, the annual precipitation is from 25 to 35\r\ninches. There are none of these European irrigation regions where the\r\nrainfall is less than 10, and generally it is over 20 inches. But you\r\nwill see that the most of the Californian irrigation regions have less\r\nthan 15 inches, some less than 10, and the greatest rainfall of any\r\nlarge irrigable region in California is 18 inches, or, exceptionally,\r\nfor smaller regions, 25 inches; while in Europe, the maxima are from 25\r\nto 40 inches in countries where irrigation has long been practiced. It\r\nfollows, then, that there is no place in Europe where it is so much\r\nneeded as over a large part of California. Another reason why the\r\nnecessity is felt in our Pacific Coast State, is found in the character\r\nof our soils; and not alone the surface soils, but the base of the\r\nsoil--the deep subsoils. We have soils exceptionally deep; soils which\r\nextend below the surface to 50 feet, underlaid by loose sand and open\r\ngravels, so that the rainfall of winter is lost in them. The annual\r\nrain seldom runs from the surface. It follows that these lands are\r\ngenerally barren of vegetation without the artificial application of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nConsidering now the sources of water-supply: we have in the southern\r\npart of the State many streams which flow only for a few weeks after\r\nrainfall, and other streams which run two or three months after the\r\nrainy season. But there is not a stream in all California south of the\r\nSierra Madre (except the Colorado, which has it sources of supply\r\noutside of the State) which flows during the summer with a greater\r\nvolume than about 70 to 80 cubic feet per second--a stream 15 feet in\r\nwidth, 2 feet deep, and flowing at the rate of 2½ to 3 feet per\r\nsecond--a little stream that, in the eastern part of the continent,\r\nwould be thought insignificant. The largest stream for six months in\r\nthe year, in all southern California, is the Los Angeles river. The\r\nSanta Aña river, the next largest, flows from two sevenths to one third\r\nas much; the San Gabriel, the next largest, has perhaps two thirds or\r\nthree fourths as much as the Santa Aña; and so, a stream which will\r\ndeliver as much water as will flow in a box 4 feet wide and 1½ feet\r\ndeep, at a moderate speed, during summer months, would be regarded as a\r\ngood-sized irrigation feeder in that southern country. In the greater\r\ninterior basin or central valley, we find other conditions. Here we\r\nhave a different class of streams. The great Sierra Nevada receives\r\nsnow upon its summits, which does not melt till May or June and July.\r\nThe melting of these snows is the source of supply of the streams; so\r\nthat, while in far southern California, with two or three exceptions,\r\nthe greater flow of water in the streams is almost gone by June, in\r\nthis central region it is the period of the height of irrigation, and\r\nthe streams are flowing at their maximum. Kern river presents about\r\n2000 to 3000 cubic feet of water per second; King's river presents in\r\nthe maximum flow of the season about twice to three times as much as\r\nKern river; the Tuolumne river about as much as King's. As we go\r\nfarther north, the Sacramento river presents more than three times as\r\nmuch as the Tuolumne, so that in the northern part of the great valley,\r\nwhere the rainfall on the valley itself is greatest, and, consequently,\r\nthe necessity for irrigation is least, the irrigation supply increases;\r\nand conversely, the greatest area of irrigation in the valley and the\r\ngreatest necessity for it, is, in general, where the water supply is\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nAbout 100 years ago irrigation was commenced in California. The Roman\r\nCatholic priests, coming from Mexico where irrigation had long been\r\npracticed, introduced it. They established missions among the Indians,\r\nstarted cultivation, and by the labor of these Indians built the\r\noriginal irrigation works. The practice of irrigation was extended in\r\nSan Diego county, as far as we are able to trace, to several thousand\r\nacres; in San Bernardino county in the southern interior valley, they\r\nthus cultivated and watered, perhaps 2000 acres; and in Los Angeles\r\ncounty there were possibly 3000 acres irrigated under Mexican rule.\r\nTraces of the old mission works are found in San Diego, San Bernardino\r\nand Los Angeles counties, and as far north as Monterey county.\r\n\r\nThen came the gold fever, when canals were dug throughout the\r\nfoot-hills of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, for the supply of\r\nwater for the mining of gold; and these canals have since, in many\r\ninstances, been turned into feeders for irrigation. Several thousand\r\nmiles of irrigation ditches have thus been created from old mining\r\nditches. In 1852, a band of Mormons came from Salt Lake into the San\r\nBernardino valley; they bought a Mexican grant rancho there, took\r\npossession of some old mission works, constructed others and started\r\nirrigating. That was probably the first irrigation colony, on a large\r\nscale, composed of others than Mexicans, in California. In 1856, some\r\nMissouri settlers went into the valley of Kern river, diverted water\r\nfrom that stream, and commenced irrigation upon a small scale. In 1858,\r\nthe waters of Cache creek, in the Sacramento valley, were taken out for\r\nirrigation. In 1859, the waters of King's river were taken out and\r\nutilized for irrigation. These instances represent in general outline\r\nthe commencement of irrigation in the State. Now we have in the\r\nneighborhood of 750,000 or 800,000 acres actually irrigated each year,\r\nand that represents what would ordinarily be called an irrigation area\r\nof 1,200,000 acres; and there are commanded by the works--reasonably\r\nwithin the reach of existing canals--an area of about 2,500,000 acres.\r\n\r\nIn the organization of irrigation enterprises there is great diversity.\r\nCommencing with the simplest form, we have a ditch constructed by the\r\nindividual irrigator for his own use; we have then successively ditches\r\nconstructed by associated irrigators without a definite organization,\r\nfor the service of their own land only; ditches constructed by\r\nregularly organized associations of farmers, with elected officers;\r\nworks constructed by farmers who have incorporated under the general\r\nlaws of the State and issued stock certificates of ownership in the\r\nproperties, for the service of the stockholders only; works where\r\nincorporations have been formed for the purpose of attaching water\r\nstock to lands that are to be sold, bringing in the element of\r\nspeculation; then works where the organization has been effected with a\r\nview of selling water-rights; and finally, organizations that are\r\nincorporated for the purpose of selling water. There is a great\r\ndifference between the principles of these methods of organization, and\r\nthe practical outcome is a great difference in the service of water and\r\nin the duty of water furnished by them. In selling water, measurement\r\nof volume is made by modules--the actual amount of water delivered is\r\nmeasured--or it is sold by the acre served, or in proportional parts of\r\nthe total available flow of the season.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the irrigation works of the State varies very\r\nmuch with the varying conditions under which it is practiced. In the\r\nSan Joaquin valley, King's river, for instance, comes out of the\r\nmountains nearly on a level with the surface of the plain, cutting down\r\nnot more than a few feet below its banks; and hence but little labor is\r\nrequired to divert its waters out upon the lands to be irrigated; but\r\nfarther north, the Tuolumne, as another example, comes out of the\r\nmountains in a deep cañon, and the foot-hills extend far down the plain\r\non each side. It is easily seen, then, that it will require a million\r\nor more dollars to divert from the latter stream the amount of water\r\ndiverted from King's river by the expenditure of a few months' work, by\r\na small force of the farmers themselves. On King's river, individual\r\nand simple coöperative effort is sufficient to bring water enough upon\r\nthe plains to irrigate thousands of acres, while in the case of the\r\nTuolumne river it is absolutely necessary to have associated capital in\r\nlarge amount--an entirely different principle of organization from that\r\nwhich was originally applied on King's river and the Kern and other\r\nrivers in the southern part of the great central valley. In discussions\r\non the subject of irrigation some people have advanced the idea that\r\nthe works should be undertaken by the farmers, and that capital should\r\nhave nothing to do with them. That may do very well where the physical\r\nconditions will admit of such a course, and where nothing but the\r\nfarmers' own service depends upon it; but the great majority of the\r\nstreams of California are of such a character that the work of the\r\nfarmers can avail nothing. There must be strong associations and large\r\ncapital. For this purpose special laws are required. On the Santa Aña,\r\nin San Bernardino county, water has been easily diverted, and such is\r\nthe case with every stream in the interior valley of San Bernardino and\r\nLos Angeles counties.\r\n\r\nCapital for the first works was not required. The water was procured by\r\nprimitive methods and the works were simple. But in San Diego, an\r\nentirely different condition of affairs prevailed. There the waters are\r\nback in the mountains, twenty or twenty-five miles from the coast, and\r\nthe irrigable lands are close along the coast, or within ten or twelve\r\nmiles of it. To bring the water out of these mountains requires the\r\nconstruction of ditches following the mountain sides for 20 to 35\r\nmiles. But simple ditches do not answer, because of the great quantity\r\nof water lost from them. So the companies have resorted to fluming, and\r\neven to lining the ditches with cement. Thus in San Diego, individual\r\neffort is out of the question. Farther north again, in the great\r\ninterior valley, King's river is a stream where coöperative and\r\nindividual effort have been efficient, although it requires a greater\r\namount of capital there than in the southern interior valley. In the\r\nsouthern interior valley, perhaps, $10,000 would often build a ditch\r\nand divert all the water that the supply would furnish. On King's river\r\nthe works have cost from $15,000 to $80,000 each; on Kern river the\r\nworks have cost from $15,000 to $250,000 each; and on the Tuolumne they\r\nwill cost from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000 apiece. On Merced river, the\r\ncost has been $800,000 for one work. Taking the streams from San\r\nJoaquin river north, that come out of the Sierra Nevada, up to the\r\nnorthern end of the valley where the Sacramento river enters it, every\r\nimportant stream comes into the valley within a deep gorge. The beds of\r\nseveral of the northern streams are so filled up with mining debris\r\nthat diversion from them would be comparatively easy, but in their\r\nnatural state there is not an important stream north of the San Joaquin\r\nwhich could be utilized for irrigation by any other means than through\r\nthe agency of capital in large amount. On the west side of this great\r\nvalley the tillable strip is comparatively narrow. It is on the lee\r\nside of the coast range of mountains. Precipitation is made first on\r\nthe seaward face of the Coast Range, and then crosses the valley,\r\ndropping upon the inland face of the outer range very little more than\r\nupon the valley itself, where the precipitation is only about 10\r\ninches. So that we have no streams coming out of the Coast Range into\r\nthe southern part of the interior valley specially noteworthy as\r\nirrigation feeders. But as we go northward the Coast Range becomes\r\nwider, and the big mountain basin containing Clear Lake furnishes a\r\nlarge supply of water to Cache Creek, probably enough for 10,000 acres.\r\nStony Creek flows between two ridges of the Coast Range, and out on to\r\nthe plains, furnishing about the same amount of water; but still there\r\nare no streams from the Coast Range into the valley that are comparable\r\nwith those of the Sierra Nevada. In the northeastern corner of the\r\nState, on the great plains of Modoc, we have the Pitt river, a stream\r\nof very considerable volume, but its waters are in comparatively deep\r\nchannels, not very well adapted to diversion, and the consequence is,\r\nthey have been utilized to a very small extent, only on small\r\nbottom-land farms. The whole stream can be utilized, however, and the\r\ncountry is thirsting for water.\r\n\r\nThe practice of irrigation in California is as diverse as it could well\r\nbe. California, as you know, covers a very large range in latitude, but\r\na greater range in the matter of climate and adaptability to the\r\ncultivation of crops. In the southern portion of the State, the orange\r\nand the banana and many other semi-tropical fruits flourish. In some\r\nlocalities along the foot-hills of the Sierra Nevada, also, those\r\nfruits flourish, particularly the orange and the lemon. In the valley\r\nof San Joaquin, wheat is grown by irrigation, and in some places\r\nprofitably, and in Kern county quite profitably (were it not for high\r\ntransportation charges), because the cost of distributing and applying\r\nwater has been reduced to a minimum. There the lands have been laid out\r\nwith as much care and precision as the architect would lay out the\r\nstones in a building and the mason would place them. Irrigation is\r\nconducted in some Kern river districts with the greatest ease, scarcely\r\nrequiring the use of the shovel. The lands are so laid off with the\r\ncheck levels that by simply opening gates in the proper order, as the\r\nirrigation superintendents know how, the waters flow out and cover the\r\nsuccessive plats or \"checks\" in their order, without leaving any\r\nstanding water, and finally flowing off without material waste. This is\r\nthe perfection of irrigation by the broad or submerging system,--a\r\nmethod wherein the slope of the ground is first ascertained, platted by\r\ncontours, and the checks to hold the water, constructed with scrapers,\r\nare then run out on slight grade contours--not perfectly level, but on\r\nvery gentle slopes.\r\n\r\nThere is no portion of the far southern part of the State where the\r\ncheck method is applied as it is in Kern county. The practice in San\r\nBernardino is to irrigate entirely by running water in rills between\r\nthe rows of plants. Orange trees planted 24 to 30 feet apart are\r\nirrigated by rills in plough furrows, 5 to 8 between rows, down the\r\nslope of the orchard, which slope varies from about 1 foot in a hundred\r\nto 4 or 5 in a hundred. In Los Angeles county they make banks about a\r\nfoot high around each individual tree, forming basins 5 or 6 to 10 or\r\n12 feet in diameter according to the size of the tree. Into these the\r\nwater is conducted by a ditch, and the basin being filled, the water is\r\nallowed to remain and soak away. The low, nearly flat valley lands,\r\nwhen irrigated, are generally divided into square \"checks,\" without\r\nrespect to the slope of the ground, and the surface is simply flooded\r\nin water standing 6 inches to a foot in depth.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the State, in Placer and Yuba counties, clover\r\nis grown on hills having side slopes of 10 to 15 feet in a hundred, and\r\nirrigated in plough furrows cut around on contours--which furrows are\r\nabout 5 to 10 feet apart horizontally--and the water is allowed to soak\r\ninto the ground from each such furrow.\r\n\r\nThese are the five principal methods of applying water: by the check\r\nsystem; by rills; by the basin method; by the basin method as applied\r\nto low valleys; and by contour ditches on hill sides. The method\r\nselected for any particular locality is determined not alone by the\r\ncrop to be cultivated, but also by the slope of the land and the\r\ncharacter of the soil. For instance, on lands where oranges are\r\ncultivated, in the southern part of the State, where rills are most\r\ngenerally used, water cannot be applied by the flooding system, for the\r\nreason that irrigation would be followed by cracking of the soil, so\r\nthat the trees would be killed. It is necessary on such land to\r\ncultivate immediately after irrigation, and the method of application\r\nis governed more by the soil than by the character of the crop.\r\n\r\nWe find in California very marked and important effects following\r\nirrigation. For instance, taking the great plains of Fresno, in the San\r\nJoaquin valley: when irrigation commenced there twenty years ago, it\r\nwas 70 to 80 feet down to soil water--absolutely dry soil for nearly 80\r\nfeet--and it was the rule throughout the great plain, 20 miles in width\r\nand 25 miles in length, that soil water was beyond the reach of the\r\nsuction pump; now, in places, water stands on the surface, rushes grow,\r\nmosquitos breed, malarial fevers abound, and the people are crying for\r\ndrainage; and lands, whose owners paid from five to twenty dollars per\r\nacre for the right to receive water, now need drainage, and irrigation\r\nis considered unnecessary. The amount of water taken from King's river\r\nwhich was, a few years ago, regarded as not more than sufficient for\r\none tenth of the land immediately commanded and that seemed to require\r\nit, is now applied to a fourth of the whole area; so that if irrigation\r\nkeeps on, the time will come when the whole country will require\r\ndraining.\r\n\r\nIn a district, where water is applied by the broad method, I saw in\r\n1877 enough water, by actual measurement of flow, put on 20 acres of\r\nland to cover it 18 feet deep, in one season, could it all have been\r\nretained upon it. It simply soaked into the ground, or flowed out under\r\nthe great plain. Taking cross sections of this country, north and south\r\nand east and west, I found that where the depth to soil water had,\r\nbefore irrigation, been about 80 feet, it was then 20, 30, 40 or 60 and\r\nmore feet down to it. The soil water stood under the plain in the form\r\nof a mountain, the slope running down 40 to 50 feet in a few miles on\r\nthe west and north. On the south and southwest the surface of this\r\nwater-mountain was much more steep. In the Kern river country, we have\r\na somewhat similar phenomenon. Irrigation, in the upper portion of the\r\nKern delta, affects the water in the wells 6 or 8 miles away. As I\r\nremember the effect is felt at the rate of about a mile a day, that is\r\nto say, when water is used in irrigating the upper portion of the\r\ndelta, or of Kern island, as it is called, the wells commence to rise a\r\nmile away in twenty-four hours, and five miles away in perhaps five\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIn the southern portion of the State, in San Bernardino county, at\r\nRiverside, we find no such effect at all. There it was 70 to 90 feet to\r\nsoil water before irrigation and it is, as a general rule, 70 to 90\r\nfeet still. Water applied on the surface in some places has never even\r\nwet the soil all the way down, and wells dug there, after irrigation\r\nhad been practiced for years, have pierced dry ground for 25 or 30 feet\r\nbefore getting down to where soil waters have wetted it from below. The\r\nconsequences of these phenomena are twofold. In the first place, in the\r\ncountry that fills up with water, the duty of water--the quantity of\r\nland which a given amount of water will irrigate--has increased.\r\nStarting with a duty of not more than 25 acres to a cubic foot of water\r\nper second, we now find that, in some localities, this amount irrigates\r\nfrom 100 to 160 acres; and that some lands no longer require\r\nirrigating. In the southern portion of the State, however, the cubic\r\nfoot of water irrigates no more than at first, and it is scarcely\r\npossible that it will ever irrigate much more. The saving, as\r\nirrigation goes on in the far southern portion of the State, will be\r\neffected chiefly through the better construction of canals and\r\nirrigation works of delivery and distribution. In Tulare valley, the\r\nduty of water will increase as the ground fills up.\r\n\r\nIn Fresno, a county which was regarded as phenomenally healthy,\r\nmalarial fevers now are found, while in San Bernardino, at Riverside,\r\nsuch a thing is rarely known. Coming to Bakersfield, a region which\r\nbefore irrigation commenced was famed for its malarial fevers--known as\r\nunhealthful throughout all the State--where soil water was originally\r\nwithin 15 feet of the surface, irrigation has almost entirely rid it of\r\nthe malarial effects. Chills and fever are rare now, where before\r\nirrigation they were prevalent. What is the reason that where chills\r\nand fever prevailed, irrigation has made a healthful country, while\r\nwhere chills and fevers were not known, irrigation has made it\r\nunhealthful? I account for it in this way: in the Kern river country\r\nbefore irrigation was extensively introduced, there were many old\r\nabandoned river channels and sloughs, overgrown with swamp vegetation\r\nand overhung by dense masses of rank-growing foliage. Adjacent lands\r\nwere in a more or less swampy condition; ground waters stood within 10\r\nor 20 feet of the surface, and there was no hard-pan or impermeable\r\nstratum between such surface and these waters. In other words, general\r\nswampy conditions prevailed, and malarial influences followed by chills\r\nand fevers were the result. Irrigation brought about the clearing out\r\nof many of these old channel ways, and their use as irrigating canals.\r\nThe lands were cleared off and cultivated, fresh water was introduced\r\nthrough these channels from the main river throughout the hot months,\r\nand the swamp-like condition of the country was changed to one of a\r\nwell-tilled agricultural neighborhood with streams of fresh water\r\nflowing through it; and the result, as I have said, was one happy in\r\nits effect of making the climate salubrious and healthful.\r\n\r\nConsidering now the case of the King's river or the Fresno country, the\r\nlands there were a rich alluvial deposit, abounding in vegetable matter\r\nwhich for long ages perhaps had been, except as wetted by the rains of\r\nwinter, dry and desiccated. Soil water was deep below the surface. Then\r\nirrigation came. Owing to the nature of the soil, the whole country\r\nfilled up with the water. Its absorptive qualities being great and its\r\nnatural drainage defective, the vegetable matter in the soil, subjected\r\nto more or less continued excessive moisture, has decayed. The\r\nfluctuation of the surface of the ground waters at different seasons of\r\nthe year--such surface being at times very near to the ground surface,\r\nand at other times 5 or 6 feet lower--has contributed to the decaying\r\ninfluences which the presence of the waters engendered. The result has\r\nbeen, when taken with the general overgrowth of the country with\r\nvegetation due to irrigation, a vitiation of the atmosphere by\r\nmalarious outpourings from the soil. The advantage of the pure\r\natmosphere of a wide and dry plain has been lost by the miasmatic\r\npoisonings arising from an over-wet and ill-drained neighborhood, with\r\nthe results, as affecting human healthfulness, of which I have already\r\nspoken. The remedy is of course to drain the country. The example is\r\nbut a repetition of experiences had in other countries. The energy and\r\npluck of Californians will soon correct the matter.\r\n\r\nGeorge P. Marsh, in his \"Man and Nature,\" laid it down as a rule that\r\nan effect of irrigation was to concentrate land holdings in a few\r\nhands, and he wrote an article, which was published in one of our\r\nAgricultural Department reports, in which he rather deprecates the\r\nintroduction of irrigation into the United States, or says that on this\r\naccount it should be surrounded by great safeguards. He cited instances\r\nin Europe, as in the valley of the Po, where the tendency of irrigation\r\nhad been to wipe out small land holdings, and bring the lands into the\r\nhands of a few of the nobility. He cited but one country where the\r\nreverse had been the rule, which was in the south and east of Spain,\r\nand pointed out the reason, as he conceived it, that in south and\r\nsoutheastern Spain the ownership of the water went with the land and\r\nwas inseparable from it, under ancient Moorish rights. It is a fact,\r\nthat where the ownership of water goes with the land, it prevents\r\ncentering of land ownership into few hands, after that ownership is\r\nonce divided among many persons, in irrigated regions. But Mr. Marsh\r\noverlooked one thing in predicting harm in our country; that is, that\r\nit will be many years before we will get such a surplus of poor as to\r\nbring about the result he feared. In California, the effect of\r\nirrigation has not been to center the land in the hands of a few. On\r\nthe contrary, the tendency has been just the other way. When irrigation\r\nwas introduced it became possible for small land holders to live. In\r\nFresno county, there are many people making a living for a family, each\r\non 20 acres of irrigated land, and the country is divided into 20 and\r\n40-acre tracts and owned in that way. In San Bernardino the same state\r\nof things prevails. Before irrigation, these lands were owned in large\r\ntracts, and it was not an uncommon thing for one owner to have 10,000\r\nto 20,000 acres of land. So that the rule in California, which is the\r\neffect of irrigation, is to divide land holdings into small tracts, and\r\nin this respect, also, irrigation is a blessing to the country. It\r\nenables large owners to cut up their lands and sell out to the many.\r\nLand values have advanced from $1.25 in this great valley to $50, $150\r\nand even $250 per acre, simply by attaching to the land the right to\r\ntake or use water, paying in addition an annual rental: in the southern\r\nportion of the State, they have advanced from $5 and $10 to $500 and\r\neven $1000 an acre, where the land has the right to water; and many\r\ncalculations have been made and examples cited by intelligent and\r\nprominent people, to show that good orange land or good raisin-grape\r\nland with sufficient water supply is well worth $1000 an acre. Water\r\nrights run up proportionately in value. A little stream flowing an inch\r\nof water--an amount that will flow through an inch square opening under\r\nfour inches of pressure--in the southern part of the State, is held at\r\nvalues ranging from $500 to $5000. Such a little stream has changed\r\nhands at $5000, and not at boom prices either. In the interior prices\r\nare much less, being from about a quarter to a tenth of those in the\r\nfar southern part of the State.\r\n\r\nFully one fourth of the United States requires irrigation. When I say\r\nthat, I mean that fully one fourth the tillable area of our country\r\nrequires irrigation, in order to support such a population as, for\r\ninstance, Indiana has. The irrigated regions of Italy support\r\npopulations of from 250 to 300 people to the square mile; of south\r\nFrance, from 150 to 250 people to the square mile; of southeast Spain,\r\nfrom 200 to 300. When we have 50 to 100 to the square mile in an\r\nagricultural region we think we have a great population.\r\n\r\nThe great interior valley of California will not support, without\r\nirrigation, an average of more than 15 to 20 people per square mile.\r\nIrrigate it and it will support as many as any other portion of the\r\ncountry--reasonably it will support 200 to the square mile. I have no\r\ndoubt that the population will run up to ten or twelve millions in that\r\none valley, and there are regions over this country from the\r\nMississippi to the Pacific, millions of acres, that can be made to\r\nsupport a teeming population by the artificial application of water.\r\nAnd why has it not been done before? Simply for the reason that there\r\nis a lack of knowledge of what can be done and a lack of organization\r\nand capital to carry out the enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe government has recently placed at the disposal of the United States\r\nGeological Survey an appropriation for the investigation of this\r\nsubject, to ascertain how irrigation can be secured, the cost of\r\nirrigation works, and point out the means for irrigation, in the arid\r\nregions. It is one of the wisest things Congress ever did; wise in the\r\ntime and in the subject. The time will soon come when the question\r\nwould have been forced upon the country, and the wisdom of preparing\r\nfor that time cannot be too highly commended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND ABOUT ASHEVILLE.\r\n\r\nBY BAILEY WILLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA broad amphitheatre lies in the heart of the North Carolina mountains\r\nwhich form its encircling walls; its length is forty miles from north\r\nto south and its width ten to twenty miles. At its southern gate the\r\nFrench Broad river enters; through the northern gate the same river\r\nflows out, augmented by the many streams of its extensive watershed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. NORTH CAROLINA/TENNESSEE. ASHEVILLE\r\nSHEET. Contour interval 100 feet. 1888.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION FROM THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TO THE BLUE RIDGE.\r\nNatural profiles.]\r\n\r\nFrom these water-courses the even arena once arose with gentle slope to\r\nthe surrounding heights and that surface, did it now exist, would make\r\nthis region a very garden, marked by its genial climate and adequate\r\nrainfall. But that level floor exists no longer; in it the rivers first\r\nsunk their channels, their tributaries followed, the gullies by which\r\nthe waters gathered deepened, and the old plain was thus dissected. It\r\nis now only visible from those points of view from which remnants of\r\nits surface fall into a common plane of vision. This is the case\r\nwhenever the observer stands upon the level of the old arena; he may\r\nthen sweep with a glance the profile of a geographic condition which\r\nhas long since passed away.\r\n\r\nAsheville is built upon a bit of this plain between the ravines of the\r\nFrench Broad and Swannanoa rivers, now flowing 380 feet below the\r\nlevel, and at the foot of the Beau-catcher hills; toward which the\r\nground rises gently. The position is a commanding one, not only for the\r\nfar reaching view, but also as the meeting place of lines of travel\r\nfrom north, south, east, and west. Thus Asheville became a town of\r\nlocal importance long before railroads were projected along the lines\r\nof the old turnpikes. The village was the center of western North\r\nCarolina, as well of the county of Buncombe, and was therefore\r\nappropriately the home of the district Federal court. A May session of\r\nthe court was in progress nine years ago when I rode up the muddy\r\nstreet from the Swannanoa valley. Several well-known moonshiners were\r\non trial, and the town street was crowded with their sympathizers, lean\r\nmountaineers in blue and butternut homespun. Horses were hitched at\r\nevery available rack and fence, and horse trading was active. Whiskey\r\nwas on trial at other bars than that of the court, and the long rifle,\r\npowder-horn and pouch had not been left in the mountains. To a\r\n\"tenderfoot\" (who had the day before been mistaken for a rabbit or a\r\nrevenue officer!) the attentions of the crowd were not reassuring.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion was, I felt, akin to that long afterward expressed\r\nby Groundhog Cayce: \"It air an awful thing ter kill a man by accident;\"\r\nand I staid but a very short time in Asheville.\r\n\r\nRiding away toward the sunset, I traversed the old plain without seeing\r\nthat it had had a continuous surface. I noted the many gullies, and I\r\nlost in the multitude of details the wide level from which they were\r\ncarved. That the broader fact should be obscured by the many lesser\r\nones is no rare experience, and perhaps there is no class of\r\nobservations of which this has been more generally true than of those\r\ninvolved in landscape study. But when once the Asheville plain has been\r\nrecognized, it can never again be ignored. It enters into every view,\r\nboth as an element of beauty and as evidence of change in the\r\nconditions which determine topographic forms. Seldom in the mountains\r\ncan one get that distance of wooded level, rarely is the foreground so\r\nlike a gem proportioned to its setting; all about Asheville one meets\r\nwith glimpses of river and valley, sunken in reach beyond reach of\r\nwoodland which stretch away to the blue mountains. The even ridges form\r\nnatural roadsites, and in driving one comes ever and anon upon a fresh\r\nview down upon the stream far across the plain and up to the heights.\r\nAnd to the student of Appalachian history, the dissected plain is a\r\nsignificant contradiction of the time honored phrase, \"the everlasting\r\nhills.\" That plain was a fact, the result of definite conditions of\r\nerosion; it exists no more in consequence of changes. What were the\r\noriginal conditions? In what manner have they changed? Let us take\r\naccount of certain other facts before suggesting an answer. Of the\r\nmountains which wall the Asheville amphitheatre, the Blue Ridge on the\r\neast and the Unaka chain on the west are the two important ranges. The\r\nBlue Ridge forms the divide between the tributaries of the Atlantic and\r\nthose of the Gulf of Mexico, and the streams which flow westward from\r\nit all pass through the Unaka chain. It would be reasonable to suppose\r\nthat the rivers rose in the higher and flowed through the lower of the\r\ntwo ranges, but they do not. The Blue Ridge is an irregular,\r\ninconspicuous elevation but little over 4000 feet above the sea; the\r\nUnaka mountains form a massive chain from 5000 to 6500 feet in height.\r\nThat streams should thus flow through mountains higher than their\r\nsource was once explained by the assumption that they found passage\r\nthrough rents produced by earth convulsions; but that vague guess\r\nmarked the early and insufficient appreciation of the power of streams\r\nas channel cutters, and it has passed discredited into the history of\r\nour knowledge of valley-formation. That rivers carve out the deepest\r\ncañons, as well as the broadest valleys, is now a truism which we must\r\naccept in framing hypotheses to account for the courses of the French\r\nBroad and other similar streams. Moreover, since waters from a lower\r\nBlue Ridge could never of their own impulse have flowed over the higher\r\nUnaka, we are brought to the question, was the Blue Ridge once the\r\nhigher, or have streams working on the western slope of the Unaka range\r\n(when it was a main divide), worn it through from west to east,\r\ncapturing all that broad watershed between the two mountain ranges?\r\nEither hypothesis is within the possibility of well established river\r\naction, and both suggest the possibility of infinite change in mountain\r\nforms and river systems. Without attempting here to discriminate\r\nbetween these two hypotheses, for which a broader foundation of facts\r\nis needed, let us look at the channel of the French Broad below\r\nAsheville, in the river's course through the range that is higher than\r\nits source. Descending from the old plain into the river's ravine, we\r\nat once lose all extended views and are closely shut in by wooded\r\nslopes and rocky bluffs. The river falls the more rapidly as we\r\ndescend, and its tributaries leap to join it, the railroad scarce\r\nfinding room between the rocks and the brawling current. The way is\r\ninto a rugged and inhospitable gorge whose walls rise at last on either\r\nhand into mountains that culminate some thirty miles below Asheville.\r\nAt Mountain Island the waters dash beautifully over a ledge of\r\nconglomerate and rush out from a long series of rapids into the deep\r\nwater above Hot Springs. Beyond the limestone cove in which the springs\r\noccur, the valley, though narrow still, is wider and bottom lands\r\nappear. Thus the water gap of the French Broad through the Unakas is\r\nnarrow and rugged, the river itself a tossing torrent; but had we\r\npassed down other streams of similar course, we should have found them\r\neven more turbulent, their channels even more sharply carved in the\r\nhard rocks. On Pigeon river there are many cliffs of polished\r\nquartzite, and on the Nolichucky river a V-shaped gorge some eight\r\nmiles long is terraced where the ledges of quartzite are horizontal and\r\nis turreted with fantastic forms where the strata are vertical. Where\r\nthe river valleys are of this sharp cut character in high mountains,\r\nthe abrupt slopes, cliffs and rocky pinnacles are commonly still more\r\nsharply accented in the heights. The Alpine tourist or the mountaineer\r\nof the Sierras would expect to climb from these cañons to ragged combs\r\nor to scarcely accessible needle-like peaks. But how different from the\r\nheights of the Jungfrau are the \"balds\" of the Unakas! like the\r\nice-worn granite domes of New England, the massive balds present a\r\nrounded profile against the sky. Although composed of the hardest rock,\r\nthey yet resemble in their contours, the low relief of a limestone\r\narea. Broad, even surfaces, on which rocky outcrops are few and over\r\nwhich a deep loam prevails, suggest rather that one is wandering over a\r\nplain than on a great mountain; yet you may sweep the entire horizon\r\nand find few higher peaks. The view is often very beautiful, it is\r\nfar-reaching, not grand. No crags tower skyward, but many domes rise\r\nnearly to the same heights, and dome-like, their slopes are steepest\r\ntoward the base. The valleys and the mountains have exchanged the\r\ncharacters they usually bear; the former are dark and forbidding, wild\r\nand inaccessible, the latter are broad and sunlit of softened form,\r\nhabitable and inhabited. All roads and villages are on the heights,\r\nonly passing travelers and those who prey upon them frequent the\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nThese facts of form are not local, they are general: all the streams of\r\nthe Unaka mountains share the features of the French Broad Cañon, while\r\npeaks like Great Roan, Big Bald, Mt. Guyot, are but examples of a\r\nmassive mountain form common throughout the range.\r\n\r\nThus the Unaka chain presents two peculiar facts for our consideration;\r\nit is cut through by streams rising in a lower range, and its profiles\r\nof erosion are convex upward not downward.\r\n\r\nIf we follow our river's course beyond the Unaka chain into the valley\r\nof East Tennessee we shall still find the channel deeply cut; here and\r\nthere bottomlands appear, now on one side, now on the other, but the\r\nbanks are more often steep slopes or vertical cliffs from fifty to one\r\nhundred feet high. The creeks and brooks meander with moderate fall\r\nthrough the undulating surface of the valley, but they all plunge by a\r\nmore or less abrupt cascade into the main rivers. It is thus evident\r\nthat the tributaries cannot keep pace with the rivers in\r\nchannel-cutting, and the latter will continue to sink below the surface\r\nof general degradation until their diminished fall reduces their rate\r\nof corrasion below that of the confluent streams.\r\n\r\nIf from topographic forms we turn to consider the materials, the rocks,\r\nof which they are composed, we shall find a general rule of relation\r\nbetween relative elevation and rock-hardness. Thus the great valley of\r\nEast Tennessee has a general surface 3000 feet below the mean height of\r\nthe Unakas: it is an area of easily soluble, often soft, calcareous\r\nrocks, while the mountains, consist of the most insoluble, the hardest,\r\nsilicious rocks. East of the Unakas the surface is again lower,\r\nincluding the irregular divide, the Blue Ridge; here also, the\r\nfeldspathic gneisses and mica schists are, relatively speaking, easily\r\nsoluble, and non-coherent. What is thus broadly true is true in detail,\r\nalso where a more silicious limestone or a sandstone bed occurs in the\r\nvalley it forms a greater or less elevation above the surface of the\r\nsoft rocks; where a more soluble, less coherent stratum crops out in\r\nthe mountain mass, a hollow, a cove, corresponds to it. Of valley\r\nridges, Clinch mountain is the most conspicuous example; of mountain\r\nhollows the French Broad valley at Hot Springs, or Tuckaleechee Cove\r\nbeneath the Great Smoky mountain, is a fair illustration.\r\n\r\nBut impassive rock-hardness, mere ability to resist, is not adequate to\r\nraise mountains, nor is rock-softness an active agent in the formation\r\nof valleys. The passive attitude of the rocks implies a force, that is\r\nresisted, and the very terms in which that attitude is expressed\r\nsuggest the agent which applies the force. Hardness, coherence,\r\ninsolubility,--these are terms suggestive of resistance to a force\r\napplied to wear away, to dissolve, as flowing water wears by virtue of\r\nthe sediment it carries and as percolating waters take the soluble\r\nconstituent of rocks into solution. And it is by the slow mechanical\r\nand chemical action of water that not only cañons are carved but even\r\nmountain ranges reduced to gentle slopes.\r\n\r\nIf we designate this process by the word \"degradation,\" it follows from\r\nthe relation of resistance to elevation in the region under discussion\r\nthat we may say: The Appalachians are mountains of differential\r\ndegradation; that is, heights remain where the rocks have been least\r\nenergetically acted on, valleys are carved where the action of water\r\nhas been most effective.\r\n\r\nIn order that the process of degradation may go on it is essential that\r\na land mass be somewhat raised above the sea, and, since the process is\r\na never-ceasing one while streams have sufficient fall to carry\r\nsediment, it follows that, given time enough, every land surface must\r\nbe degraded to a sloping plain, to what has been called a base level.\r\n\r\nWith these ideas of mountain genesis and waste, let us consider some\r\nphases of degradation in relation to topographic forms; and in doing so\r\nI cannot do better than to use the terms employed by Prof. Wm. M.\r\nDavis.\r\n\r\nWhen a land surface rises from the ocean the stream systems which at\r\nonce develope, are set the task of carrying back to the sea all that\r\nstands above it. According to the amount of this alloted work that\r\nstreams have accomplished, they may be said to be young, mature or\r\naged; and if, their task once nearly completed, another uplift raise\r\nmore material to be carried off, they may be said to be revived. These\r\nterms apply equally to the land-surface, and each period of development\r\nis characterized by certain topographic forms.\r\n\r\nIn youth simple stream systems sunk in steep walled cañons are\r\nseparated by broad areas of surface incompletely drained. In maturity\r\ncomplex stream systems extend branches up to every part of the surface;\r\nsteep slopes, sharp divides, pyramidal peaks express the rapidity with\r\nwhich every portion of the surface is attacked.\r\n\r\nIn old age the gently rolling surface is traversed by many quiet\r\nflowing streams; the heights are gone, the profiles are rounded, the\r\ncontours subdued. In the first emergence from the sea the courses of\r\nstreams are determined by accidents of slope, it may be by folding of\r\nthe rising surface into troughs and arches. During maturity the process\r\nof retrogressive erosion, by which a stream cuts back into the\r\nwatershed of a less powerful opponent stream, adjusts the channels to\r\nthe outcrops of soft rocks and leaves the harder strata as eminences.\r\nIn old age this process of differential degradation is complete and\r\nonly the hardest rocks maintain a slight relief.\r\n\r\nSuppose that an aged surface of this character be revived: the rivers\r\nhitherto flowing quietly in broad plains will find their fall increased\r\nin their lower courses; their channels in soft rock will rapidly become\r\ncañons, and the revived phase will retreat up stream in the same manner\r\nthat the cañons of youth extended back into the first uplifted mass. If\r\nthe area of soft rocks be bounded by a considerable mass of very hard\r\nrocks, it is conceivable that a second phase of age, a base level,\r\nmight creep over the valley while yet the summits of the first old age\r\nremained unattacked, and should perchance revival succeed revival the\r\nrecord of the last uplift might be read in sharp cut channels of the\r\ngreat rivers, while the forms of each preceding phase led like steps to\r\nthe still surviving domes of that earliest old age.\r\n\r\nIs there aught in these speculations to fit our facts? I think there\r\nis. We have seen that our mountains and valleys are the result of\r\ndifferential degradation, and that this is not only broadly true but\r\ntrue in detail also. This is evidence that streams have been long at\r\nwork adjusting their channels, they have passed through the period of\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nWe have climbed to the summits of the Unakas and found them composed of\r\nrocks as hard as those from which the pinnacle of the Matterhorn is\r\nchiseled; but we see them gently sloping, as a plain. These summits are\r\nvery, very old.\r\n\r\nWe have recognized that dissected plain, the level of the Asheville\r\namphitheatre, now 2,400 feet above the sea; it was a surface produced\r\nby subaerial erosion, and as such it is evidence of the fact that the\r\nFrench Broad River, and such of its tributaries as drain this area, at\r\none time completed their work upon it, reached a base level. That they\r\nshould have accomplished this the level of discharge of the sculpturing\r\nstreams must have been constant during a long period, a condition which\r\nimplies either that the fall from the Asheville plain to the ocean was\r\nthen much less than it now is, or that through local causes the French\r\nBroad was held by a natural dam, where it cuts the Unaka chain.\r\n\r\nIf we should find that other rivers of this region have carved the\r\nforms of age upon the surfaces of their intermontane valleys, and there\r\nis now some evidence of this kind at hand, then we must appeal to the\r\nmore general cause of base-levelling and accept the conclusion that the\r\nland stood lower in relation to the ocean than it now does.\r\nFurthermore, we have traversed the ravines which the streams have cut\r\nin this ancient plain and we may note on the accompanying atlas sheet\r\nthat the branches extend back into every part of it; the ravines\r\nthemselves prove that the level of discharge has been lowered, the\r\nstreams have been revived; and the wide ramification of the brooks is\r\nthe characteristic of approaching maturity.\r\n\r\nWe have also glanced at the topography of the valley and have found the\r\nrivers flowing in deep-cut simple channels which are young, and the\r\nsmaller streams working on an undulating surface that is very sensitive\r\nto processes of degradation.\r\n\r\nThe minor stream systems are very intricate and apparently mature, but\r\nthey have not yet destroyed the evidence of a general level to which\r\nthe whole limestone area was once reduced, but which now is represented\r\nby many elevations that approach 1,600 feet above the sea. Here then in\r\nthe valley are young river channels, mature stream systems and faint\r\ntraces of an earlier base level, all of them more recent than the\r\nAsheville level, which is in turn less ancient than the dome-like\r\nsummits of the Unakas.\r\n\r\nWhat history can we read in these suggestive topographic forms and\r\ntheir relations?\r\n\r\nThe first step in the evolution of a continent is its elevation above\r\nthe sea. The geologist tells us that the earliest uplift of the\r\nAppalachian region after the close of the Carboniferous period was\r\npreceded or accompanied by a folding of the earth's crust into\r\nmountainous wave-like arches; upon these erosion at once began and\r\nthese formed our first mountains. Where they were highest the geologist\r\nmay infer from geologic structure and the outcrops of the oldest rocks;\r\nbut the facts for that inference are not yet all gathered and it can\r\nonly be said that the heights of that ancient topography were probably\r\nas great over the valley of Tennessee as over the Unaka chain. The\r\npositions of rivers were determined by the relations of the arches to\r\neach other and, as they were in a general way parallel, extending from\r\nnortheast to southwest, we know that the rivers too had\r\nnortheast-southwest courses. From that first drainage system the\r\nTennessee river, as far down as Chattanooga, is directly descended, and\r\nwhen the geologic structure of North Carolina and East Tennessee is\r\nknown, we may be able to trace the steps of adjustment by which the\r\nmany waters have been concentrated to form that great river. At present\r\nwe cannot sketch the details, but we know that it was a long process\r\nand that it was accompanied by a change in the _raison d'être_ of the\r\nmountain ranges. The first mountains were high because they had been\r\nrelatively raised; they gave place to hills that survived because they\r\nhad not been worn down. A topography of differential uplift gave place\r\nto one of differential degradation. And to the latter the dome-like\r\n\"balds\" of the Unakas belong. Those massive summits of granite,\r\nquartzite and conglomerate are not now cut by running waters; they are\r\ncovered with a mantel of residual soil, the product of excessively slow\r\ndisintegration, and they are the remnants of a surface all of which has\r\nyielded to degradation, save them. In time the streams will cut back\r\nand carve jagged peaks from their masses, but standing on their heights\r\nmy thought has turned to the condition they represent--the condition\r\nthat is past. And thus in thought I have looked from the Big Bald out\r\non a gently sloping plain which covered the many domes of nearly equal\r\nheight and stretched away to merge on the horizon in the level of the\r\nsea. That, I conceive, was the first base level plain of which we have\r\nany evidence in the Appalachians and from that plain our present\r\nvalleys have been eroded. The continental elevation must then have been\r\n3,000 or 4,000 feet less than it is now, and the highest hills were\r\nprobably not more than 2,500 feet above the sea. This was perhaps a\r\nperiod of constant relation between sea and land, but it was succeeded\r\nby one during which the land slowly rose. The rivers, which had\r\nprobably assumed nearly their present courses, were revived; the\r\nimportant channels soon sank in cañons, the tributaries leaped in\r\nrapids and cut back into the old base level. The region continued to\r\nrise during a period long enough to produce the essential features of\r\nthe mountain ranges of to-day; then it stood still in relation to the\r\nsea or perhaps subsided somewhat, and the French Broad and probably\r\nother rivers made record of the pause in plains like that about\r\nAsheville. Again the land rose slowly; again it paused, and rivers,\r\nworking always from their mouths backward, carved a base-level in the\r\nlimestones of the great valley; but before that level could extend up\r\nthrough the gorges in the Unakas, the continent was raised to its\r\npresent elevation, the streams responded to the increased fall given\r\nthem and the rivers in the valley began to cut their still incomplete\r\ncañons.\r\n\r\nAre we not led step by step from these latest sharply cut channels up\r\nstream through the chapters of erosion to the still surviving domes of\r\nan early old age? Let us sum up the history we have traced. There is\r\nreason to believe that:\r\n\r\n1st. The consequent topography of the earliest Appalachian uplift was\r\nentirely removed during a prolonged period of erosion and was replaced\r\nby a relief of differential degradation.\r\n\r\n2d. The balds of the Unakas represent the heights of that first-known\r\napproach to a base-level.\r\n\r\n3d. The topography of the region has been revived by a general, though\r\nnot necessarily uniform, uplift of 3,000 feet or more, divided by two\r\nintervals of rest; during the first of these the Asheville base-level\r\nwas formed; during the second, the valley alone was reduced.\r\n\r\n4th. The latest movement of the uplift has been, geologically speaking,\r\nquite recent, and the revived streams have accomplished but a small\r\npart of their new task.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions are reached on the observation of a single class of\r\nfacts in one district; they must be compared with the record of\r\ncontinental oscillation on the sea coasts, in the deposits of the\r\ncoastal plain, and in the topography of other districts.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Appalachians is written in every river system and on\r\nevery mountain range, but in characters determined for each locality by\r\nthe local conditions. Only when the knowledge, to which every tourist\r\nmay contribute, is extended over the entire region shall we know\r\nconclusively the whole story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRIP TO PANAMA AND DARIEN.\r\n\r\nBY RICHARD U. GOODE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States of Colombia in its act of\r\nConcession to the Panama Canal Company provided that it should give to\r\nthe latter _\"gratuitement et avec toutes les mines qu'ils pourront\r\ncontenir\"_ 500,000 hectares of land.\r\n\r\nSome of the conditions attached to this grant were, that the land\r\nshould be selected within certain limits and surveyed by the Canal\r\nCompany; that a topographical map should be made of the areas surveyed\r\nand that an amount equal to that surveyed for the canal should also be\r\nsurveyed for the benefit of the Colombian Government. It was also\r\nfurther agreed that it would not be necessary to complete the canal\r\nbefore any of the land should be granted, but that it would be given at\r\ndifferent times in amounts proportional to the amount of work\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThus in 1887, the Government agreed to consider that one-half of the\r\nwork on the canal had been finished and that the canal was consequently\r\nentitled to 250,000 hectares of land, upon the completion of the\r\nnecessary surveys, etc.\r\n\r\nThe land was eventually chosen partly in Darien and partly in Chiriqui\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nIn Darien three lots, one between the Paya and Mangle rivers, one\r\nbetween the Maria and Pirri rivers, the two amounting to 100,000\r\nhectares, and one lot of 25,000 hectares between the Yape and Pucro\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nIn Chiriqui, which is a Province of Panama just east of Costa Rica, two\r\nlots were chosen amounting to 125,000 hectares, one between the Sigsola\r\nand Rabalo rivers, and the other between the Catabella and San Pedro\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nThe Canal Company wanted the title to the land in order that it might\r\nbe used as collateral security in bolstering up the finances of the\r\ncorporation, and the Colombian Government was doubtless very willing to\r\nlet the Canal Company have this amount or as much more as was wanted,\r\nboth parties being equally aware of the valueless character of the land\r\nfor any practical purposes.\r\n\r\nMy services were engaged in 1888 in connection with the astronomical\r\nwork incident to the survey of these grants and it was intended that I\r\nshould visit both Darien and Chiriqui, but the contract term expired\r\nabout the time of the completion of the work in Darien, which was taken\r\nup first, and it was deemed prudent for various reasons, the chief of\r\nthem being the unhealthiness of the locality at that season of the\r\nyear, about the middle of April, not to remain longer on the Isthmus.\r\nIf it had been possible to work as expeditiously as in this country\r\nthere would have been ample time to have completed the necessary\r\nastronomical work for both surveys, and without understanding men and\r\nmethods peculiar to a tropical country I started out with this\r\nexpectation, but soon found out that any efforts looking towards\r\nexpediting any particular matter were not only useless but were\r\ndetrimentally reactive upon the person putting forward such efforts.\r\nThus it was nearly the first of March before I reached Darien, having\r\nsailed from New York a month previously. Passage was had from Panama to\r\nDarien in a steamer chartered for the purpose. Sailing across the Bay\r\nof Panama and entering the Tuyra River at Boca Chica, we ascended the\r\nriver as far as the village Real de St. Marie. At this point the\r\nsteamer was abandoned and further transportation was had in canoes.\r\n\r\nDarien is a province of the State of Panama and its boundaries as given\r\nby Lieut. Sullivan in his comprehensive work on \"Problem of\r\nInteroceanic Communication,\" are as follows: \"The Atlantic coast line\r\nis included between Point San Blas and Cape Tiburon; that of the\r\nPacific extends from the mouth of the Bayano to Point Ardita. The\r\neastern boundary is determined by the main Cordillera in its sweep\r\nacross the Isthmus from a position of close proximity to the Pacific,\r\nnear Point Ardita, to a similar position near Tiburon, on the Atlantic.\r\nThe valleys of the Mandinga and Mamoni-Bayano determine its western\r\nlimit.\"\r\n\r\nThe Darien hills as seen from the Atlantic side present to the view an\r\napparently solid ridge of mountains, although there are in reality many\r\nlow passes which are concealed by projecting spurs.\r\n\r\nThe dividing ridge hugs close to the Atlantic, and the rivers, of which\r\nthere are a great many on this side, plunge abruptly to the sea. On the\r\nPacific side the rivers have a much longer distance to flow before\r\nreaching the sea, and the territory bordering on the ocean is low and\r\nswampy. The tidal limit of the Tuyra River is nearly fifty miles from\r\nits mouth, and on this river and many of its tributaries one can travel\r\nmany miles inland before ground sufficiently solid to land upon can be\r\nfound. The vegetation within this low lying area is thick and closely\r\nmatted together, and this fact taken in connection with the swampy\r\ncharacter of the ground, makes travel on foot through any portion of it\r\nexceedingly difficult. Therefore the various rivers, which form a very\r\ncomplex system and penetrate everywhere are the natural highways of the\r\ncountry. The chief rivers on the Pacific side are the Tuyra and Boyano\r\nwith their numerous tributaries and on the Atlantic watershed is the\r\nAtrato.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity noticed at Real de St. Marie, which is at the junction of\r\nthe Pyrrhi and Tuyra rivers and at which point the tide has a rise and\r\nfall of twelve or fifteen feet, was that at low tide it was impossible\r\nto enter the mouth of the Pyrrhi with a boat, while five or six miles\r\nup the stream there was always a good supply of flowing water and at\r\ndouble that distance it became a mountain torrent.\r\n\r\nOutside of the swampy area the character of the country is rough and\r\nmountainous. The valleys are narrow and the ridges exceedingly sharp,\r\nthe natural result of a great rain fall. The hills are able to resist\r\nthe continued wasting effect of the vast volumes of descending water\r\nonly by their thick mantle of accumulated vegetation, and were it not\r\nfor this protection the many months of continuous annual rain would\r\nlong ago have produced a leveling effect that would have made\r\nunnecessary the various attempts of man to pierce the Isthmian\r\nmountains and form an artificial strait.\r\n\r\nThe ridges are sometimes level for a short distance, but are generally\r\nbroken and are made up of a succession of well rounded peaks. These\r\npeaks are always completely covered with trees and from the top of the\r\nsharpest of them it is impossible to get a view of the surrounding\r\ncountry. The highest point climbed was about 2,000 feet above sea level\r\nand the highest peak in Darien is Mt. Pyrrhi which is between three and\r\nfour thousand.\r\n\r\nDarien has been the scene of a great deal of surveying and exploration\r\nfrom the time that Columbus, in 1503, coasted along its shores, hoping\r\nto find a strait connecting the two oceans, up to the present time.\r\nBalboa, in 1510, discovered the Pacific by crossing the Darien\r\nmountains from Caledonia Bay. This discovery taken in connection with\r\nthe broad indentations of the land noted by Columbus, led the old world\r\nto believe in the existence of a strait, and the entire coast on each\r\nside of the new world was diligently searched. The Cabots, Ponce de\r\nLeon and Cortez interested themselves in this search and it was not\r\nuntil about 1532 that all expectations of finding the strait were\r\nabandoned. The idea of a direct natural communication between the\r\noceans being thus dispelled, the question of an artificial junction\r\narose, and in 1551 a Spanish historian recommended to Philip II. of\r\nSpain the desirability of an attempt to join the oceans by identically\r\nthe same routes to which the attention of the whole civilized portion\r\nof the world is now being drawn, that is, Tehauntepec, Nicaragua and\r\nPanama. From this time up to the commencement of the work of the\r\nIsthmian expeditions sent out by the United States, and which lasted\r\nfrom 1870 to 1875, but little geographical knowledge relative to Darien\r\nwas obtained. The United States expeditions undoubtedly did a great\r\namount of valuable exploration and surveying, and while the names of\r\nStrain, Truxton, Selfridge and Lull will always be held in high esteem\r\nfor what they accomplished in this direction, still it is to be\r\nregretted that with all the resources at their command they did not\r\nmake a complete map of the country. And just here I want to bring\r\nforward the suggestion that all that has been accomplished and more,\r\ncould have been accomplished if the various explorers had known, or\r\npractically utilized, a fact that my own experience and that of other\r\ntopographers, in this country and Darien, has impressed upon me; and\r\nthat is, that it is easier in a rough and mountainous country to travel\r\non the ridge than in the valley. In Darien they were looking for a low\r\npass in the Cordillera and this was what should have first been sought,\r\ndirectly. Having found the low passes the valleys of the streams\r\ndraining therefrom could have then been examined, and thus all\r\nnecessary information could have been obtained and the subject\r\nexhausted. The plan followed by the Isthmian expeditions was to ascend\r\na stream with the hope of finding a suitable pass. The pass might be\r\nfound or it might not, and if not, so much labor as far as the direct\r\nsolution of the problem was concerned was lost. A pass of low altitude\r\nwas of primary importance and should have been sought for in an\r\nexhaustive way.\r\n\r\nHumboldt said in substance, \"Do not waste your time in running\r\nexperimental lines across. Send out a party fully equipped, which\r\nkeeping down the dividing ridge the whole length of the Isthmus, by\r\nthis means can obtain a complete knowledge of the hypsometrical and\r\ngeological conditions of the dam that obstructs the travel and commerce\r\nof the world.\" But strange to say this plan suggested by such an\r\neminent authority as Humboldt and so strongly recommended by common\r\nsense, has never been followed, and to-day after all the money that has\r\nbeen spent and the lives lost in explorations in Darien, there is not\r\nsufficient data collected to prove conclusively that there does not now\r\nexist some route for an interoceanic canal that possesses merits\r\nsuperior to any at present known. It is true the dividing ridge would\r\nbe difficult to follow on account of the great number of confusing\r\nspurs, but I think I am safe in saying that starting from the summit of\r\nthe main ridge at Culebra pass on the Isthmus of Panama, the dividing\r\nridge extending to the pass at the head waters of the Atrato could be\r\nexhaustively followed and studied with as much facility as could either\r\nthe Tuyra or Atrato rivers, embracing with each their respective\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\nI traveled on some of the high dividing ridges in Darien, and did not\r\nfind that progress was at all difficult, and especially noted the fact\r\nof the absence of tangled undergrowth and matted vines which is so\r\ncharacteristic of the Darien forests generally.\r\n\r\nNow a few words about the inhabitants of Panama and Darien, and in\r\nreferring to these I mean the native inhabitants and not the\r\nindiscriminate gathering of all nationalities that were attracted by\r\nthe Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nIn Central and South America, as in North America, the aboriginal\r\ninhabitant was the Indian. When the Spaniards first attempted to\r\ncolonize Darien they were met and resisted by the native Indian just as\r\nour forefathers were in Virginia and Massachusetts, and as with us so\r\nin Panama and Darien the Indians have been driven back by degrees from\r\nthe shores of both oceans until now they are found only in the far\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThey resemble our Indians in appearance, but are smaller. They are\r\naverse to manual labor and live almost entirely by hunting and fishing,\r\nalthough they sometimes have small plantations of plantains, bananas,\r\noranges and lemons. The Spaniards in settling in the new country\r\nbrought very few women with them and the Colombian of to-day is the\r\nresult of the admixture of the Indian and Spanish blood, and has many\r\nof the characteristics of each race. In addition to the Indian and\r\nColombian there are in Panama and Darien a comparatively large number\r\nof negroes, who were originally imported as slaves by the early\r\nSpaniards, and who now constitute by far the larger portion of the\r\ninhabitants of Darien, being found usually in villages along the\r\nvalleys of the larger streams. In contrast to the Colombian and Indian\r\nthey are large in stature and make excellent laborers.\r\n\r\nThe principal villages in Darien, as Yovisa, Pinagana and Real de St.\r\nMarie, are inhabited exclusively by the negroes, with the exception of\r\na Spanish judge in each, who exercises great authority. Besides being a\r\njudge in civil and criminal cases, he practically controls everything\r\nin his particular village, as all contracts for labor are negotiated\r\nwith him and settlement for services made through him.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching Darien the first work assigned me was the survey and\r\nexploration of the Pyrrhi river. This survey was made for two purposes:\r\nprimarily, to determine if any of the country bordering upon it was of\r\na sufficiently desirable character to include it within the grant, and\r\nsecondly, to secure data for the general topographical map. My\r\ninstructions were to proceed as far south as latitude 7° 30'. The\r\nascent of the river was made in canoes until the frequency of rapids\r\nmade it necessary to abandon them, and then the journey was continued\r\non foot, generally wading in the middle of the stream, as the\r\nundergrowth was too thick to admit of progress along the banks.\r\nSometimes the water was very shallow; at other times, where it had been\r\nbacked up by dams of porphyritic rock, it reached above the waist, and\r\nnear the end of the journey where the river ran between vertical walls\r\nof great height it was necessary to swim in order to get beyond this\r\ncañon.\r\n\r\nThe survey of this river was satisfactorily accomplished in about a\r\nweek. The method adopted for the survey was to take compass bearings\r\nand to estimate distances. These courses and distances were plotted as\r\nthey were taken and thus the topographical and other features could be\r\nreadily sketched in connection with them. To check and control this\r\nwork, observations were taken every day at noon with a sextant, on the\r\nsun, for latitude and time, and at night circum-meridian altitudes of\r\nstars were obtained when possible.\r\n\r\nThus a number of rivers were surveyed--the Maria, Tucuti, Yovisa and\r\nother tributaries of the Tuyra. When it was found that a sufficiently\r\ncorrect idea of the country for topographical purposes could not be\r\nobtained by simply meandering the water courses, lines or _trochas_\r\nwere cut through the forest from stream to stream, and where two\r\nstreams thus connected were tributaries of a common river, all of which\r\nhad been previously surveyed, a closed figure was obtained, an\r\nadjustment for errors of closure made, and by putting together the\r\ntopographical data obtained by the four lines, there was generally\r\nfound to be sufficient information to give a satisfactory though of\r\ncourse a crude delineation of the included area.\r\n\r\nAfter a number of rivers had been examined with more or less accuracy\r\nin this way, it was finally decided that the area for one portion of\r\nthe grant best suited for the purposes of the Canal Company lay on the\r\nright bank of the Tuyra river, and that the portion of the river which\r\nlay between the mouths of two of its tributaries, the Rio Yape and the\r\nRio Pucro, should be one of the boundaries of the grant. The Yape and\r\nPucro have courses approximately parallel to each other and at right\r\nangles to the Rio Tuyra, and these streams were also chosen as boundary\r\nlines, so that the grant would have the three rivers as natural\r\nboundaries, and the fourth and closing boundary was to be a straight\r\nline from a certain point on the Yape to the Pucro, so located as to\r\ninclude within the four boundaries an area approximately equal to the\r\namount of the grant, which in this particular case was 25,000 hectares.\r\nThe problem then presented was: given three rivers for three boundaries\r\nof a figure to establish a fourth and artificial line, completing the\r\nfigure in such a way that it should contain a given area, and also to\r\nprocure data for a topographical map of the country surveyed.\r\n\r\nThis survey was put under my direction and I was instructed to proceed\r\nto a point overlooking the Tuyra river, between the Rio Yape and the\r\nRio Pucro, near the mouth of the Rio Capite, for the purpose of\r\nestablishing a base camp. Leaving Real de St. Marie on the evening of\r\nMarch 15th, with a fleet of twelve canoes and about thirty native\r\nlaborers, we reached the site for the camp in two days. After landing\r\neverything, the work of clearing away trees and underbrush over an area\r\nsufficiently large for the camp was commenced. The men worked willingly\r\nwith axe and machéte, and soon the forest receded and left bare a\r\nsemi-circular space facing the river.\r\n\r\nTwo houses were needed and without saw, nail or hammer the construction\r\nwas commenced and prosecuted rapidly. Straight trees about six inches\r\nin diameter and twenty feet long were cut and planted vertically in\r\nholes dug out with the machéte, and horizontal pieces of a smaller\r\ndiameter were securely fastened on with long tough strips of bark, and\r\nthus a square or oblong frame was fashioned. The horizontal pieces were\r\nplaced at a distance of about three feet from the ground, on which a\r\nflooring was eventually laid, and at the top of the frame where the\r\nslope of the roof began. On the top pieces other poles were laid and\r\nfastened across and lengthwise, and on these the men stood while making\r\nthe skeleton of the roof. The latter was made very steep for better\r\nprotection against the rain. After the ridge pole was put in position\r\nother smaller poles were fastened on parallel and perpendicular to it\r\nso that the whole roof was divided up into squares, and it was finally\r\ncompleted by weaving in thick bunches of palm and other leaves in such\r\na way as to make it thoroughly water-proof. For our purpose no\r\nprotection on the sides of the structures other than the projecting\r\neaves was considered necessary. A floor of poles laid very close\r\ntogether was put in one house, the one used for sleeping purposes, and\r\nin the other a table for eating, writing, draughting, etc., was made.\r\nThus in two or three days the place was made thoroughly habitable, and\r\nmen were detailed to see that the grounds, etc., were always kept\r\nthoroughly clean and in a good sanitary condition, a very necessary\r\nprecaution in a tropical country. The forest afforded game, the river\r\nan abundance of fish; bananas, oranges, lemons and pineapples were\r\neasily procured from the natives, who also furnished material for a\r\npoultry yard, and thus while located at camp Capite, situated as it was\r\non a picturesque spot overlooking two swiftly flowing rivers, with good\r\ndrinking water, a commissary department well stocked, a French cook who\r\nwould have done himself credit anywhere, I could not but think that\r\nheretofore pictures of life in Darien had been too somberly drawn, and\r\nthat where so much suffering and sickness had prevailed among the early\r\nexplorers it was because they had gone there not properly outfitted,\r\nand because carried away with ambitious enthusiasm their adventurous\r\nspirit had caused them often to undertake that which their calmer\r\njudgment would not have dictated; and that to these causes as much as\r\nto the unhealthy condition of the locality was due their many\r\nhardships. Several days were spent here getting time and latitude\r\nobservations and in mapping out plans for the work. It was decided that\r\nthe mouths of the Yape, Capite and Pucro and other points along these\r\nrivers, such as mouths of tributary streams, etc., should be\r\nastronomically located, that these points should be connected by\r\ncompass lines, and also that cross lines should be run at various\r\npoints from the Yape to the Capite and from the Capite to the Pucro. It\r\nwas further decided that as time was limited it would be impracticable\r\nto run out the fourth side of the figure that would contain the grant,\r\nas the country around the headwaters of the streams was known to be\r\nexceedingly rough and mountainous, and to follow any straight line\r\nwould necessarily involve a great amount of laborious cutting and\r\nclimbing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in order to know just what direction this line should\r\nfollow it would be first necessary to make a connected preliminary\r\nsurvey of the three rivers; to plot this survey and then by inspection\r\nof the map and consideration of various starting points to decide on\r\nthe most available location of the fourth side.\r\n\r\nInstead of this it was considered best and sufficient to arbitrarily\r\nadopt a certain waterfall on the Rio Yape, the location of which was\r\napproximately known from a reconnoisance previously made, as the\r\ninitial point of the line connecting the upper Yape with the Pucro and\r\nclosing the figure. Thus it only became necessary, as far as the\r\nboundaries were concerned, to run a line along the Tuyra, joining the\r\nmouths of the Yape and Pucro; to run a line from the mouth of the Yape\r\nto the waterfall above referred to; and to run up the Pucro\r\nsufficiently far to be certain that when the work was completed and\r\nplotted, a line drawn from the position of the waterfall on the map in\r\nsuch a way as to include the desired area would intersect the Pucro at\r\nsome point within the limit of what had been surveyed. I have not time\r\nto go into the details of the various trips by land and water necessary\r\nto carry out these plans.\r\n\r\nBefore starting it was known exactly what was necessary to be done;\r\neach assistant engineer had his work clearly mapped out before him, and\r\neach one faithfully performed the task allotted to him, so that the\r\nwhole survey was brought to a successful completion. This brought to a\r\nclose all the work in Darien, the other tracts having been surveyed\r\nbefore my arrival and consequently the whole expedition returned to\r\nPanama, and soon afterwards I returned to this country.\r\n\r\nIn going to and returning from Darien, I passed twice over the Panama\r\nrailroad and along the line of the Panama canal, and I have thought\r\nthat a few facts relative to the canal and railroad might prove of\r\ninterest to the Geographical Society.\r\n\r\nPublished herewith is a sketch showing the location of the railroad,\r\ncanal and tributary drainage, and a profile along the axis of the\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH SHOWING LOCATION OF PANAMA RAIL ROAD, PANAMA\r\nCANAL AND TRIBUTARY DRAINAGE. N. Peters, Photo-Lithographer,\r\nWashington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFILE OF THE PANAMA CANAL. Black indicates work\r\nexecuted; stipple, work to be executed to complete a lock-canal; white,\r\nadditional work to be executed to complete a sea-level canal.]\r\n\r\nThe first surveys for the railroad were made in 1849, and it was\r\nprobably the excitement of the California gold fever that brought about\r\nits construction at this particular time. Ground was broken in January,\r\n1850, and the last rail was laid in January, 1855.\r\n\r\nThe length of the road is 47.6 miles and it crosses the dividing summit\r\nat an elevation of 263 feet above the mean level of the Atlantic ocean.\r\nThe maximum grade is 60 feet to the mile. Soon after the road was built\r\naccurate levels were run to determine the difference, if any, between\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and it was found that the mean levels\r\nwere about the same, although there are of course variations owing to\r\nlocal causes, and considerable differences of height at times, owing to\r\ndifferences of tides in the Atlantic and Pacific. At Aspinwall the\r\ngreatest rise is only 1.6 feet, while at Panama there is at times a\r\ndifference of over 21 feet between high and low water. The cost of the\r\nrailroad was $75,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the railroad was probably the deciding cause that led\r\nLesseps to the adoption of this location of the proposed canal.\r\n\r\nNow that the scheme has practically failed it is very easy to see and\r\nappreciate the difficulties that lay in the way of building a canal at\r\nthis particular place; and it certainly seems that if sound engineering\r\nprinciples had been adopted at least some of these difficulties could\r\nhave been understood and properly combatted. The whole scheme, however,\r\nfrom an engineering standpoint, seems to have been conducted in the\r\nmost blundering manner.\r\n\r\nLesseps is a diplomat and financier, but in no sense a great engineer.\r\nIn the construction of the Suez canal, the questions of diplomacy and\r\nfinance were the most difficult to settle, while the engineering\r\nproblems were comparatively simple. In Panama the opposite conditions\r\nprevailed. Concessions were freely given him by the Colombian\r\ngovernment and money freely offered him by the French people, but he\r\nnever grasped or comprehended the difficulties that nature had planted\r\nin his way, and these only seemed to occur to him when they blocked\r\nprogress in a certain direction. The Paris Conference, controlled by\r\nLesseps, decided on the 29th of May, 1879, that the construction of an\r\ninteroceanic canal was possible and that it should be built from the\r\nGulf of Limon to the Bay of Panama.\r\n\r\nThe tide-level scheme was adopted and the following dimensions decided\r\nupon, viz: Length, 45.5 miles; depth, 28 feet; width at water line 164\r\nfeet, and width at bottom 72 feet.\r\n\r\nThe route determined upon was about the same as that of the railroad,\r\nthat is along the valleys of the Chagres and Obispo, crossing the\r\ndivide at the Culebra pass and then descending to the Pacific along the\r\ncourse of the Rio Grande. The profile which is reproduced from\r\n\"Science,\" shows the state of progress on January 1st, 1888, and the\r\namount of excavation that has been done since that time would make but\r\na slight difference in the appearance of the profile. The portion shown\r\nin black is what has been removed along the axis of the canal and\r\nrepresents an expenditure of over $385,000,000 and seven years' labor.\r\nThe reasons that make the scheme impracticable are briefly these, some\r\nof which were known before the work was commenced, and all of which\r\nshould have been understood.\r\n\r\nThe first great difficulty is in cutting through the ridge culminating\r\nat Culebra where the original surface was 354 feet above the bed of the\r\nproposed canal. It was never known what the geological formation of\r\nthis ridge was until the different strata were laid bare by the\r\nworkman's pick, and the slope adopted, 1½ to 1, was found to be\r\ninsufficient in the less compact formations, even at the comparatively\r\nshallow depth that was reached, and many and serious landslides were of\r\nfrequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nAnother serious difficulty was the disposition of the excavated\r\nmaterial, for upon the completion of a sea-level course this channel\r\nwould naturally drain all the country hitherto tributary to the Chagres\r\nand Rio Grande, and any substance not removed to a great distance would\r\neventually be washed back again into the canal. But perhaps the\r\ngreatest difficulty was in the control of the immense surface drainage.\r\nThe Chagres river during the dry season is, where it crosses the line\r\nof the canal near Gamboa, only about two feet deep and 250 feet wide,\r\nbut during a flood the depth becomes as much as forty feet, the width\r\n1,500 feet, and the volume of water discharged 160,000 cubic feet per\r\nsecond. The bed of the river is here 42 feet above sea level, or 70\r\nfeet above what the bottom of canal would have been. Now add to this a\r\n40-foot flood and we have a water surface one hundred and ten feet\r\nabove the bed of the canal.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep this immense volume of water from the canal it was\r\nproposed to build a large dam at Gamboa, and to convey the water by an\r\nentirely different and artificial route to the Atlantic. It is\r\nimpossible to show on the map the whole drainage area of the Chagres,\r\nbut a rough calculation shows it to be about 500 square miles. This\r\nseems a small total drainage area, but when it is considered that the\r\nannual rainfall is about 12 FEET, that this rainfall is confined to\r\nabout one half the year, and that in six consecutive hours there has\r\nbeen a precipitation of over six inches of rain, some idea of the\r\namount of water that finds its way through the Chagres river during the\r\nwet season may be formed.\r\n\r\nAs I said before it was proposed to protect the canal from the waters\r\nof the upper Chagres by an immense dam at Gamboa, and for the purpose\r\nof controlling the water tributary to the lower Chagres two additional\r\ncanals or channels were to be constructed on either side of the main\r\ncanal. Thus, as the river is very tortuous and the axis of the canal\r\ncrossed it twenty-five or thirty times, many deviations of the former\r\nbecame necessary. In some places the canal was to occupy the bed of the\r\nriver and in others it cut across bends leaving the river for its\r\noriginal natural purpose of drainage. The difficulty in retaining the\r\nfloods in these constructed channels would of course be immense,\r\nespecially in some of the cases where the water rushing along its\r\nnatural channel is suddenly turned at right angles into an artificial\r\none. Thus it is clear that aside from the enormous expense incident to\r\nthe removal of the immense amount of earth and rock necessary to\r\ncomplete the canal, that granting all this accomplished, it would be\r\npractically impossible to maintain a sea-level canal by reason of the\r\ndifficulty in controlling the Chagres and preventing the canal from\r\nfilling up.\r\n\r\nThe canal company finally came to the conclusion that the sea-level\r\nscheme was impracticable and it was abandoned, and plans were prepared\r\nfor a lock system. As seen on the profile there were ten locks\r\nproposed, five on each side of the summit level. The summit level was\r\nto be 150 feet above sea level and consequently each lock would have a\r\nlift of thirty feet. The profile was constructed especially to show the\r\namount remaining to be executed to complete the lock system, and a mere\r\ninspection will show the relative amount of completed and uncompleted\r\narea along the axis of the canal. To complete the summit cut it is\r\nstill necessary to excavate 111 feet, 93 feet having already been\r\nexcavated, through a horizontal distance of 3300 feet. The width of cut\r\nat top surface for the required depth at a slope of 1½ to 1 would be\r\n750 feet, but as I said before, at this slope landslides were of\r\nfrequent occurrence and the slope would probably have to be increased\r\nto at least 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nGranting the necessary excavations made, there would be still the\r\nproblem of the control of the Chagres river and the water supply for\r\nthe summit level to provide for. At first it was thought that the water\r\nsupply could be obtained from the storage of the waters of the Chagres\r\nand Obispo, but this idea was eventually abandoned, either from a\r\nbelief in the insufficiency of the water supply during the dry season,\r\nor from difficulties in the way of conveying the water to the summit\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the advice of Mr. Eiffel, a noted French engineer, was\r\nsought, and after a visit to the Isthmus he proposed that the summit\r\nlevel should be supplied by pumping from the Pacific. A contract was\r\nimmediately made with Eiffel, who was heralded all over the world as\r\nthe man who would save the canal, and immediately a positive day, the\r\nseventh that had been announced, was fixed for the opening of the great\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nI do not know just how much work was done towards perfecting the system\r\nfor pumping, but probably very little was ever accomplished in this\r\ndirection, as soon after this scheme was thought of the available funds\r\nof the canal company began to be very scarce, and there has been since\r\nthen a general collapse of work all along the line until now it is\r\nentirely suspended. From what I have said and from what can be seen\r\nfrom the profile, it will be readily understood that as far as the\r\nsea-level project is concerned the amount done is not much more than a\r\nscraping of the surface, relatively speaking, and that what has been\r\ndone is in places where the obstacles were fewest.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the lock canal about one third of the necessary excavation\r\nhas been made along the axis of the canal, but taking into\r\nconsideration other requirements necessary for the completion of the\r\nscheme, I should estimate, roughly, that probably only one sixth of the\r\nwhole amount of work had been accomplished. The question now naturally\r\narises as to what will be the probable future of this great enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe French people have seen the scheme fail under Lesseps in whom they\r\nhad the most unbounded confidence, and it is not likely that they will\r\nraise any more money to be put in it as a business enterprise under any\r\nother management. Saddled as it is with a debt of nearly four hundred\r\nmillions of dollars, it would be difficult to convince any one that it\r\ncould ever prove to be a paying investment. Nor do I think that any\r\nAmerican or English corporation can be organized that could obtain such\r\nconcessions from Lesseps as would make the scheme an inviting field for\r\ncapitalists, and thus my opinion is that the _\"Compagnie Universelle du\r\nCanal Interocéanique de Panama\"_ has irretrievably collapsed, and that\r\nthe canal will remain, as it is now, the most gigantic failure of the\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSS NICARAGUA WITH TRANSIT AND MACHÉTE.\r\n\r\nBY R. E. PEARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action of this National Society, with its array of distinguished\r\nmembers, in turning its attention for an hour to a region which has\r\ninterested the thinking world for more than three centuries gives me\r\npeculiar pleasure and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI propose this evening to touch lightly and briefly upon the natural\r\nfeatures of Nicaragua, to note the reasons for the interest which has\r\nalways centered upon her, to trace the growth of the great project with\r\nwhich her name is inseparably linked; to show you somewhat in detail,\r\nthe life, work, and surroundings of an engineer within her borders; and\r\nfinally to show you the result that is to crown the engineer's work in\r\nher wide spreading forests and fertile valleys.\r\n\r\nThat portion of Central America now included within the boundaries of\r\nour sister republic Nicaragua, has almost from the moment that European\r\neyes looked upon it attracted and charmed the attention of explorers,\r\ngeographers, great rulers, students, and men of sagacious and far\r\nreaching intellect.\r\n\r\nFrom Gomara the long list of famous names which have linked themselves\r\nwith Nicaragua reaches down through Humboldt, Napoleon III., Ammen,\r\nLull, Menocal and Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe shores were first seen by Europeans in 1502, when Columbus in his\r\nfourth voyage rounded the cape which forms the northeast angle of the\r\nstate, and called it \"Gracias á Dios,\" which name it bears to-day.\r\nColumbus then coasted southward along the eastern shore.\r\n\r\nIn 1522, Avila, penetrated from the Pacific coast of the country to the\r\nlakes and the cities of the Indian inhabitants. Previous to this the\r\ncountry was occupied by a numerous population of Aztecs, or nearly\r\nallied people, as the quantities of specimens of pottery, gold images,\r\nand other articles found upon the islands and along the shores of the\r\nlakes, prove conclusively.\r\n\r\nIn 1529 the connection of the lakes with the Caribbean sea was\r\ndiscovered, and during the last half of the eighteenth century a\r\nconsiderable commerce was carried on by this route between Granada on\r\nLake Nicaragua and the cities of Nombre de Dios, Cartagena, Havana and\r\nCadiz.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 Nicaragua threw off the rule of the mother country and in 1823\r\nformed with her sister Spanish colonies, a confederation. This\r\nconfederation was dissolved in 1838, and since then Nicaragua has\r\nconducted her own affairs. In point of advancement, financial solidity\r\nand stability of government she stands to-day nearly, if not quite, at\r\nthe head of the Central American republics.\r\n\r\nNicaragua extends over a little more than four degrees each of latitude\r\nand longitude, from about N. 11° to N. 15° and from 83° 20' W. to 87°\r\n40' W.\r\n\r\nIts longest side is the northern border from the Gulf of Fonseca\r\nnortheasterly to Cape Gracias á Dios, two hundred and ninety miles.\r\nFrom that cape south to the mouth of the Rio San Juan, the Caribbean\r\ncoast line, is two hundred and fifty miles. Nearly due west across the\r\nIsthmus to Salinas Bay on the Pacific, is one hundred and twenty miles.\r\nThe Pacific coast line extends thence northwest one hundred and sixty\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn point of size Nicaragua stands first among the Central American\r\nrepublics having an area of 51,600 square miles. It is larger than\r\neither the State of New York or Pennsylvania, about the size of\r\nDenmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland combined, and is\r\none-fourth as large as France or Germany. Its population numbers about\r\n300,000.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf of Fonseca, at the northern, and Salinas Bay at the southern\r\nextremity of the coast line are two of the finest and largest harbors\r\non the Pacific coast of Central America. About midway between them is\r\nthe fine harbor of Corinto, and there are also several other ports\r\nalong the coast, at San Juan del Sur, Brito and Tamarindito. On the\r\nCaribbean coast no harbors suitable for large vessels exist, but\r\nnumerous lagoons and bights afford the best of shelter for coasting\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nThe central portion of Nicaragua is traversed, from north to south, by\r\nthe main _cordillera_ of the isthmus, which, here greatly reduced in\r\naltitude, consists merely of a confused mass of peaks and ridges with\r\nan average elevation scarcely exceeding 1,000 feet.\r\n\r\nBetween this mountainous region and the Caribbean shore stretches a low\r\nlevel country, covered with a dense forest, rich in rubber, cedar,\r\nmahogany and dye woods. It is drained by several large rivers whose\r\nfertile intervales will yield almost incredible harvests of plantains,\r\nbananas, oranges, limes, and other tropical fruits.\r\n\r\nWest of the mountain zone is a broad valley, about one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet above the level of the sea, extending from the Gulf of\r\nFonseca, southeasterly to the frontier of Costa Rica. The greater\r\nportion of this valley is occupied by two lakes, Managua and Nicaragua.\r\nThe latter one hundred and ten miles long by fifty or sixty miles wide\r\nis really an inland sea, being one-half as large as Lake Ontario and\r\ntwice as large as Long Island Sound. These lakes, with the rainfall of\r\nthe adjacent valleys, drain through the noble San Juan river, which\r\ndischarges into the Caribbean at Greytown, at the southeast angle of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nBetween the Pacific and these lakes is a narrow strip of land, from\r\ntwelve to thirty miles in width, stretching from the magnificent plain\r\nof Leon with its cathedral city, in the north, to the rolling indigo\r\nfields and the cacao plantations which surround the garden city of\r\nRivas, in the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEON CATHEDRAL. _Julius Bien & Co._]\r\n\r\nThe lowest pass across the backbone of the New World, from Behring's\r\nStrait to the Straits of Magellan, extends along the San Juan valley\r\nand across the Lajas--Rio Grande \"divide,\" between Lake Nicaragua and\r\nthe Pacific; the summit of this divide is only one hundred and\r\nfifty-two feet above the sea and forty-two feet above the lake.\r\n\r\nNicaragua presents yet another unique physical feature. Lying between\r\nthe elevated mountain masses of Costa Rica on the south and Honduras on\r\nthe north, the average elevation of its own mountain backbone hardly\r\none thousand feet, it is the natural thoroughfare of the beneficent\r\nnortheast Trades. These winds sweep in from the Caribbean across the\r\nAtlantic slopes, break the surface of the lakes into sparkling waves,\r\nand then disappear over the Pacific, aerating, cooling and purifying\r\nthe country, destroying the germs of disease and making Nicaragua the\r\nhealthiest region in Central America.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the eastern portion of the country is of the luxuriant\r\nsameness peculiar to all tropical countries.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the lakes and between them and the Pacific, the\r\nisolated mountain peaks which bound the plain of Leon on the northeast;\r\nthe mountain islands of Madera and Ometepe; the towering turquoise\r\nmasses of the Costa Rican volcanoes; and the distant blue mountains of\r\nSegovia and Matagalpa, visible beyond the sparkling waters of the\r\nlakes, feast the eye with scenic beauties, unsurpassed elsewhere in\r\ngrandeur, variety and richness of coloring.\r\n\r\nThe products of the country are numerous despite the fact that its\r\nresources are as yet almost entirely undeveloped.\r\n\r\nMaize, plantains, bananas, oranges, limes, and indeed every tropical\r\nfruit, thrive in abundance. Coffee is grown in large quantities in the\r\nhilly region in the northwest; sugar, tobacco, cotton, rice, indigo and\r\ncacao plantations abound between the lakes and the Pacific; potatoes\r\nand wheat thrive in the uplands of Segovia; the Chontales region east\r\nof Lake Nicaragua, a great grazing section, supports thousands of head\r\nof cattle; and back of this are the gold and silver districts of La\r\nLibertad, Javali and others.\r\n\r\nNumerous trees and plants of medicinal and commercial value are found\r\nin the forests. Game is plentiful and of numerous varieties; deer, wild\r\nhog, wild turkey, manatee and tapir; and fish abound in the streams and\r\nrivers. The temperature of Nicaragua is equable. The extreme variation,\r\nrecorded by Childs, was 23° observed near the head of the San Juan in\r\nMay, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe southeast wind predominates during the rainy season. Occasionally,\r\nin June or October as a rule, the wind hauls round to southwest and a\r\n_temporal_ results, heavy rain sometimes falling for a week or ten\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe equatorial cloud-belt, following the sun north in the spring, is\r\nlate reaching Nicaragua, and the wet season is shorter than in regions\r\nfarther south. The average rainfall, based on the records of nine\r\nyears, is 64.42 inches. The \"trades\" blow almost throughout the year.\r\nStrong during the dry season and freshening during the day; the wind\r\ncomes from the east-northeast, and blows usually for four to five days,\r\nwhen, hauling to the east or southeast for a day or two, it calms down,\r\nthen goes back to northeast and rises again.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish discoverers of the great Lake Nicaragua, coming upon it\r\nfrom the Pacific, and noting the fluctuations of level caused by the\r\naction of the wind upon its broad surface, mistook these fluctuations\r\nfor tides and felt assured that some broad strait connected it with the\r\nNorth Sea. Later, when Machuca had discovered the grand river outlet of\r\nthe lake, and the restless searching of other explorers in every bay\r\nand inlet along both sides of the American isthmus had extinguished\r\nforever the ignis fatuus \"Secret of the Strait,\" Gomara pointed this\r\nout as one of the most favorable localities for an artificial\r\ncommunication between the North and South Seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NICARAGUA CANAL. _Julius Bien & Co._]\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1851, however, that an accurate and scientific survey\r\nof a ship canal route was made by Col. O. W. Childs.\r\n\r\nThis survey which showed the lake of Nicaragua to be only one hundred\r\nand seven feet above the sea, and the maximum elevation between the\r\nlake and the Pacific to be only forty-one feet, exhibited the\r\nadvantages of this route so clearly and in such an unanswerable manner\r\nthat it has never since been possible to ignore it.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, under the administration of General Grant and largely through\r\nthe unceasing efforts of Admiral Ammen, the United States began a\r\nseries of systematic surveys of all the routes across the American\r\nisthmus from Tehuantepec to the head waters of the Rio Atrato; and six\r\nyears later, with the plans and results of all these surveys before it,\r\na commission composed of General Humphreys, Chief of Engineers, U. S.\r\nArmy; Hon. Carlile Patterson, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey; and\r\nRear-Admiral Daniel Ammen, Chief of Bureau of Navigation, U. S. Navy;\r\ngave its verdict in favor of the Nicaragua route.\r\n\r\nThe International Canal Congress at Paris, in 1879, had such convincing\r\ninformation placed before it that it was forced, in spite of its\r\nprejudices, to admit that in the advantages it offered for the\r\nconstruction of a lock canal, the Nicaragua route was superior to any\r\nother across the American isthmus.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, and again in 1880 Civil Engineer A. G. Menocal, U. S. N., the\r\nchief engineer of previous governmental surveys, resurveyed and revised\r\nportions of the route, and in 1885 the same engineer, assisted by\r\nmyself, surveyed an entirely new line on the Caribbean side, from\r\nGreytown to the San Juan river, near the mouth of the San Carlos.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of Nicaragua, all these surveys (except the last),\r\nwere confined almost entirely to the San Juan river, and its immediate\r\nbanks; and the country on either side beyond these narrow limits was,\r\nup to 1885, almost entirely unknown. Between Lake Nicaragua and the\r\nPacific, however, every pass from the Bay of Salinas to the Gulf of\r\nFonseca had been examined.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the party of which I was a member pushed a nearly direct line\r\nacross the country from a point on the San Juan, about three miles\r\nbelow the mouth of the Rio San Carlos, to Greytown, a distance of\r\nthirty-one miles by our line, as compared with fifty-six miles by the\r\nriver and forty-two miles by the former proposed canal route.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1887, I went out in charge of a final surveying\r\nexpedition, consisting of some forty engineers and assistants and one\r\nhundred and fifty laborers, to resurvey and stake out the line of the\r\ncanal preparatory to the work of construction.\r\n\r\nThe information and personal experience gained in previous surveys made\r\nit possible, without loss of time, to locate the various sections of\r\nthe expedition in the most advantageous manner, and push the work with\r\nthe greatest speed consistent with accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe location lines of the previous surveys were taken as a preliminary\r\nline and carefully re-measured and re-levelled. Preliminary offsets\r\nwere run; the location made, and staked off upon the ground; offsets\r\nrun in from three hundred to one hundred feet apart, extending beyond\r\nthe slope limits of the canal; borings made at frequent intervals; and\r\nall streams gauged.\r\n\r\nThe result of this work was a series of detail charts and profiles,\r\nbased upon rigidly checked instrumental data, and covering the entire\r\nline from Greytown to Brito, from which to estimate quantities and\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined by those familiar with tropical countries, the\r\nprosecution of a survey in these regions is an arduous and difficult\r\nwork, and one demanding special qualifications in the engineer. His\r\ndays are filled with a succession of surprises, usually disagreeable,\r\nand constant happenings of the unexpected. Probably in no other country\r\nwill the traveler, explorer, or engineer, find such an endless variety\r\nof obstacles to his progress.\r\n\r\nEvery topographical feature of the country is shrouded and hidden under\r\na tropical growth of huge trees and tangled underbrush, so dense that\r\nit is impossible for even a strong, active man, burdened with nothing\r\nbut a rifle, to force himself through it without a short, heavy sword\r\nor _machéte_, with which to cut his way.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the most observant engineer and expert\r\nwoodsman may pass within a hundred feet of the base of a considerable\r\nhill and not have a suspicion of its existence, or he may be entirely\r\nunaware of the proximity of a stream until he is on the point of\r\nstepping over the edge of its precipitous banks.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the country has to be laboriously felt out, much as a\r\nblind man familiarizes himself with his surroundings. In doing this\r\nwork the indispensable instrument, without which the transit, the\r\nlevel, and indeed the engineer himself is of no use, is the national\r\nweapon of Nicaragua, the _machéte_, a short, heavy sword.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he is able to walk, the son of the Nicaraguan _mozo_ or\r\n_huléro_ takes as a plaything a piece of iron hoop or an old knife, and\r\nimitates his father with his _machéte_. As he gets older a broken or\r\nworn-down weapon is given him, and when he is able to handle it, a full\r\nsize _machéte_ is entrusted to him and he then considers himself a man.\r\nFrom that day on, waking or sleeping, our Nicaraguan's _machéte_ is\r\nalways at his side. With it he cuts his way through the woods; with it\r\nhe builds his camp and his bed; with it he kills his game and fish;\r\nwith it at a pinch he shaves himself, or extracts the thorns from his\r\nfeet; with it he fights his duels, and with it, when he dies, his\r\ncomrades dig his grave.\r\n\r\nWhen in the field the chief of a party, equipped with a pocket compass\r\nand an aneroid barometer, is always skirmishing ahead of the line with\r\na _machétero_, or axeman, to cut a path for him. A pushing chief,\r\nhowever, speedily dispenses with the _machétero_ and slashes a way for\r\nhimself much more rapidly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he decides where the line is to go the engineer calls to the\r\n_machéteros_ and the two best ones immediately begin cutting toward the\r\nsound of his voice. They soon slash a narrow path to him, drive a stake\r\nwhere he was standing and then turn back toward the other _machéteros_,\r\nwho have been following them, cutting a wider path and clearing away\r\nall trees, vines and branches, so that the transit man can see the flag\r\nat the stake. The moment the leading _machéteros_ reach him the chief\r\nstarts off again and by the time the main body of axemen have reached\r\nhis former position the head _machéteros_ are cutting toward the sound\r\nof his voice in a new position.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the line is cleared the transit man takes his sight and\r\nmoves ahead to the stake, the chainmen follow and drive stakes every\r\nhundred feet, and the leveller follows putting in elevations and cross\r\nsections. In this way the work goes on from early morning until nearly\r\ndark, stopping about an hour for lunch.\r\n\r\nAfter the day's work comes the dinner, the table graced with wild hog,\r\nor turkey, or venison, or all. After dinner the smoke, then the day's\r\nnotes are worked up and duplicated and all hands get into their nets.\r\nFor a moment the countless nocturnal noises of the great forest,\r\nenlivened perhaps by the scream of a tiger, or the deep, muffled roar\r\nof a puma, fall upon drowsy ears, then follows the sleep that always\r\naccompanies hard work and good health, till the bull-voiced howling\r\nmonkeys set the forest echoing with their announcement of the breaking\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nIn reconnoissance and preliminary work the experienced engineer, is\r\nable, in many cases, to avoid obstacles without vitiating the results\r\nof his work, but in the final location, in staking out absolute curves\r\nand driving tangents thousands of feet long across country, no dodging\r\nis possible.\r\n\r\nOn the hills and elevated ground the engineer can, comparatively\r\nspeaking, get along quite comfortably, his principal annoyances being\r\nthe uneven character of the ground, which compels him to set his\r\ninstrument very frequently, and the necessity of felling some gigantic\r\ntree every now and then.\r\n\r\nIn the valleys and lowlands there is an unceasing round of obstacles.\r\nThe line may run for some distance over level ground covered with a\r\ncomparatively open growth, then without warning it encounters the wreck\r\nof a fallen tree, and hours are consumed hewing a passage through the\r\nmass of broken limbs and shattered trunk, all matted and bound together\r\nwith vines and shrubbery. A little farther on a stream is crossed, and\r\nthe line may cross and recross four or five times in the next thousand\r\nfeet. The engineer must either climb down the steep banks, for the\r\nstreams burrow deep in the stiff clay of these valleys, ford the stream\r\nand climb the opposite bank, or he must fall a tree from bank to bank\r\nand cross on its slippery trunk twenty or twenty-five feet above the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nEither on the immediate bank or in its vicinity is almost certain to be\r\nencountered a _\"saccate\"_ clearing. This may be only one or two hundred\r\nfeet across or it may be a half a mile. In the former case the\r\n_\"saccate\"_ grass will be ten or fifteen feet in height and so matted\r\nand interwoven with vines and briars that a tunnel may be cut through\r\nit as through a hedge. If the clearing be large, the tough, wiry grass\r\nis no higher than a man's head, and a path has to be mowed through it,\r\nwhile the sun beats down into the furnace-like enclosure till the blade\r\nof the _machéte_ becomes almost too hot to touch.\r\n\r\nBut worse than anything thus far mentioned are the _Silico_ or black\r\npalm swamps. Some of these in the larger valleys and near the coast are\r\nmiles in extent.\r\n\r\nOccupied exclusively by the low, thick _Silico_ palms, these swamps are\r\nin the wet season absolutely impassable except for monkeys and\r\nalligators, and even at the end of the dry season the engineer enters\r\nupon one with sinking heart as well as feet, and emerges from it tired\r\nand used up in every portion of his anatomy. It is with the utmost\r\ndifficulty that he finds a practicable place to locate his instrument,\r\ngenerally utilizing the little hummocks formed by the trunks of the\r\nclusters of palms, and in moving from point to point he is compelled to\r\nwade from knee to shoulder deep in the black mud and water.\r\n\r\nGeneral reconnaissances from high trees in elevated localities, simple\r\nenough in theory, are by no means easy in a country so miserly with its\r\nsecrets as this, nor are their results reliable without a great\r\nexpenditure of time, labor, and patience.\r\n\r\nOn level, undulating and moderately broken ground, the tops of the\r\ntrees, though they may be one hundred and fifty feet from the ground,\r\nare level as the top of a hedge. Even an isolated hill if it be rounded\r\nin shape presents hardly better facilities, the trees at the base and\r\non the sides, in their effort to reach the sunlight grow taller than\r\nthose on the summit, and there is no one tree that commands all the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIf however an isolated hill of several hundred feet in height be found,\r\nits steep sides culminating in a sharp peak, one day's work by three or\r\nfour good axmen, in cutting neighboring trees, will prepare the way for\r\na study of the general relief and topography of the adjacent country.\r\nIf after these preliminaries have been completed the engineer imagines\r\nthat he has only to climb the tree and sketch what he sees, to obtain\r\nreliable knowledge of the country, he is doomed to serious surprises in\r\nthe future. If he makes the ascent during the middle of the day, he\r\nwill, after he has cooled off and rested from his exhausting efforts,\r\nsee spread out before him a shimmering landscape in which the uniform\r\ngreen carpet and the vertical sun combined, have obliterated all\r\noutlines except the more prominent irregularities of the terrene, and\r\nhave blended different mountain ranges, one of which may be several\r\nmiles beyond the other, into one, of which only the sky profile is\r\ndistinct. Naturally under these conditions estimates of distance may be\r\nhalf or double the truth.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of extracting reliable information from these\r\ntree-top reconnaissances. If it be in the rainy season the observer\r\nmust be prepared to make a day of it, and when he ascends the tree in\r\nthe morning he takes with him a long light line with which to pull up\r\nhis coffee and lunch.\r\n\r\nThen aided by the successive showers which sweep across the landscape,\r\nleaving fragments of mists in the ravines, and hanging grey screens\r\nbetween the different ranges and mountains, bringing out the relief\r\nfirst of this and then of that section, an accurate sketch may\r\ngradually be made. The time of passage of a shower from one peak to\r\nanother, or to the observer, may also be utilized as a by no means to\r\nbe despised check upon distance estimates.\r\n\r\nIf it be the dry season, the observer may take his choice between\r\nremaining on his perch in the tree from before sunrise to after sunset,\r\nor making two ascents, one early in the morning and the other late in\r\nthe afternoon. In this case the slowly dispersing clouds of morning,\r\nand the gradually gathering mists at sunset, together with the reversed\r\nlights and shadows at dawn and sunset, bring out very clearly the\r\nrelief of the terrene, the overlapping of distant ranges, and the\r\ncourse of the larger streams.\r\n\r\nThis kind of work cannot be delegated to anyone, and besides the\r\narduous labor involved in climbing the huge trees, there are other\r\nserious annoyances connected with it. The climber is almost certain to\r\ndisturb some venomous insect which revenges itself by a savage sting\r\nwhich has to be endured; or he may rend clothes and skin also, on some\r\nthorny vine, or another, crushed by his efforts, may exude a juice\r\nwhich will leave him tattooed for days; then, though there may not be a\r\nmosquito or fly at the base of the tree, the top will be infested with\r\nmyriads of minute black flies, which cover hands and face, and with\r\nextremely annoying results. On the other hand the explorer may as a\r\ncompensation have his nostrils filled with the perfume of some\r\nbrilliant orchid on a neighboring branch; and there is a breezy\r\nenjoyment in watching the showers as they rush across the green carpet,\r\nand in listening to the roar with which the big drops beat upon the\r\ntree tops.\r\n\r\nThe special phase of field work which fell to my personal lot was\r\nentirely reconnaissance, consisting of canoe examinations of all\r\nstreams in the vicinity of the line of the canal, to determine their\r\nsources, character of valley, and approximate water shed; of rapid\r\nair-line compass and aneroid trails, to connect one stream, or valley\r\nhead with another, or furnish a base line for a general sketch plan of\r\na valley; and of studies of the larger features of the terrene, from\r\nelevated tree tops.\r\n\r\nThe last has been already described; in the second the experience was\r\nvery similar to that of the parties in running main lines. On these\r\noccasions three or at most four hardy _huléros_ (rubber hunters)\r\ncomprised the party, two carrying the blankets, mosquito bars and\r\nprovisions for several days, and one or two cutting the lightest\r\npossible practicable trail and marking prominent trees.\r\n\r\nIn a day's march of from five to eight miles, and this was the utmost\r\nthat even such a light, active and experienced party could cover in one\r\nday, every possible and some almost impossible kinds of traveling was\r\nencountered, and thoroughly exhausted men crept into their bars every\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe canoe reconnaissances were more agreeable, though some most\r\nunpleasant as well as most enjoyable memories are connected with them.\r\n\r\nThe innumerable large fallen trees which obstruct the streams and over\r\nor through which the canoe must be hauled bodily, the almost inevitable\r\ncapsizing of the canoe, the monotonous red clay banks on either side\r\nand the frequent necessity of lying down at night in a bed of mud into\r\nwhich the droves of wild pigs which inhabit these valleys have trampled\r\nthe clayey soil, are among the disagreeable incidents.\r\n\r\nFrom the head of canoe navigation to their sources the character of\r\nthese streams is entirely different, and both in 1888 and in 1885 I\r\nhave followed them far up into mountain gorges, the beauty of which is\r\nas fresh in my memory as if I had been there but yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the canoe on these reconnaissances usually consisted of\r\nthree picked men, and when the canoe had been pushed as far up stream\r\nas it was possible for it to go, two of the men were left with it while\r\nthe third and best, slinging the blankets, bars, and a little coffee,\r\nsugar, and milk, upon his back pushed on with me. Wading through the\r\nshallow water up the bed of the stream, taking bearings and estimating\r\ndistances, while my _huléro_ followed, ever alert to strike some drowsy\r\nbeauty of a fish in the clear water; the source of the stream was\r\ngenerally reached in a day, and never did we make preparations to sleep\r\non some bed of clean, yellow sand washed down by the stream in flood\r\ntimes, but what I had a plump turkey hanging from my belt, and my\r\n_huléro_ several fine fish.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about the climate of Nicaragua and its effect\r\nupon the inhabitants of more northerly countries when exposed to it.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the experience of the numerous expeditions sent out\r\nby the United States, and the reports of the surgeons attached to those\r\nexpeditions would have long since settled the matter. To those who\r\ncannot understand how there can be such a difference in climate between\r\ntwo localities so slightly removed as Panama and Nicaragua, and the\r\nformer possessing a notoriously deadly climate, the experience of the\r\nrecent surveying expedition must be conclusive.\r\n\r\nOnly five members of that expedition had ever been in tropical climates\r\nbefore, and the rodmen and chainmen of the party were young men just\r\nout of college who had never done a day's manual labor, nor slept on\r\nthe ground a night in their lives. Arriving at Greytown during the\r\nrainy season, the first work that they encountered was the transporting\r\nof their supplies and camp equipage to the sites of the various camps.\r\nThis had to be done by means of canoes along streams obstructed with\r\nlogs and fallen trees. Some parties were a week in reaching their\r\ndestination, wading and swimming by day, lifting and pushing their\r\ncanoes along, and at night lying down on the ground to sleep.\r\n\r\nOne party worked for six months in the swamps and lagoon region\r\ndirectly back of Greytown, and several other parties worked for an\r\nequal length of time in the equally disagreeable swamps of the valley\r\nof the San Francisco. Several of these officers are down there yet, as\r\nfresh as ever. In making tours of inspection of the different sections\r\nI have repeatedly, for several days and nights in succession, passed\r\nthe days traveling in the woods through swamps and rain, and the nights\r\nsleeping as best I could, curled up under a blanket in a small canoe,\r\nwhile my men paddled from one camp to the next.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this exposure not only were there no deaths in the\r\nexpedition but there was not a single case of serious illness, and the\r\nofficers who have returned up to this time, were in better health and\r\nweight than when they went away.\r\n\r\nOf course the men had the best of food that money could obtain and\r\nprevious experience suggest, and the chiefs of all parties were\r\nrequired to strictly enforce certain sanitary regulations in regard to\r\ncoffee in the morning, a thorough bath and dose of spirits on returning\r\nfrom work, and mosquito bars and dry sleeping suits at night; yet the\r\nclimate must be held principally responsible for a sanitary result\r\nwhich I believe could not be excelled in any temperate zone city, with\r\nthe same number of men, doing the same arduous work under conditions of\r\nequal exposure.\r\n\r\nThe forests everywhere abound in game and every party which included in\r\nits personnel a good rifle-shot was sure of a constant supply of wild\r\npig, turkey, quail and grouse, varied by an occasional deer, all\r\nobtained in the ordinary work of reconnoissance and surveying. For the\r\nmen's table there was abundance of monkey, iguana and macaw.\r\n\r\nParties in the lower valleys of the various streams had no trouble in\r\nadding two or three varieties of very toothsome fish to their bill of\r\nfare, though these fish were rarely caught with the hook, but usually\r\nshot, or knifed by an alert native, as they basked in the shallows.\r\nThese parties also obtained occasionally a _danta_ (tapir) or a\r\nmanatee.\r\n\r\nOn the river it was possible to obtain a fine string of fish with hook\r\nand line, then there was the huge tarpon to be had for the spearing,\r\nand fish pots sunk in suitable places were sure to yield a mess of\r\nfresh water lobsters. Ducks were also occasionally shot.\r\n\r\nThe forms of life are even more numerous in the vegetable than in the\r\nanimal kingdom. The effect of these wonderful forests is indescribable,\r\nand though many writers have essayed a description, I have yet to see\r\none that does the subject justice. Only a simple enumeration of\r\ncomponent parts will be attempted here. First comes the grand body of\r\nthe forest, huge almendro, havilan, guachipilin, cortez, cedar,\r\ncottonwood, palo de leche trees, and others rising one hundred and\r\nfifty or two hundred feet into the scintillant sunshine. The entire\r\nfoliage of these trees is at the top and their great trunks reaching up\r\nfor a hundred feet or more without a branch offer a wonderful variety\r\nof studies in types of column. Some rise straight and smooth, and true,\r\nothers send out thin deep buttresses, and others look like the\r\nmuscle-knotted fore-arm of a Titan, with gnarled fingers griping the\r\nground in their wide grasp.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the form of the tree trunks may be, the shallow soil upon\r\nthe hills and the marshy soil in the lowlands, has taught them that\r\nthere is greater safety and stability in a broad foundation than in a\r\ndeeply penetrating one, and so almost without exception the tree roots\r\nspread out widely, on, or near, the surface. Beneath the protecting\r\nshelter of these patriarchs, as completely protected from scorching sun\r\nand rushing wind as if in a conservatory, grow innumerable varieties of\r\npalms, young trees destined some day to be giants themselves, and\r\nothers which never attain great size. Still lower down, luxuriate\r\nsmaller palms, tree ferns, and dense underbrush, and countless vines.\r\nThese latter, however, are by no means confined to the underbrush, many\r\nof them climb to the very tops of the tallest trees, cling about their\r\ntrunks and bind them to other trees and to the ground with the toughest\r\nof ropes. With one or two exceptions these vines are an unmitigated\r\nnuisance. To them more than to anything else is due the\r\nimpenetrableness of the tropical thicket. Of all sizes and all as tough\r\nas hemp lines, they creep along the ground, catching the traveler's\r\nfeet in a mesh from which release is possible only by cutting. They\r\nbind the underbrush together in a tough, elastic mat, which catches and\r\nholds on to every projection about the clothes, jerking revolvers from\r\nbelts, and wrenching the rifle from the hand, or, hanging in trap-like\r\nloops from the trees, catch one about the neck, or constantly drag\r\none's hat from the head. The one exception noted above is the _bejuco\r\nde agua_ or water vine. This vine, which looks like an old worn manilla\r\nrope, is to be found hanging from or twined about almost every large\r\ntree upon elevated ground, and to the hot and thirsty explorer it\r\nfurnishes a most deliciously cool and clear draught.\r\n\r\nSeizing the vine in the left hand, a stroke of the _machéte_ severs it\r\na foot or two below the hand, and another quick stroke severs it again\r\nabove the hand; immediately a stream of clear, tasteless water issues\r\nfrom the lower end and may be caught in a dipper or _á la native_\r\ndirectly in the mouth. A three-foot length of vine two inches in\r\ndiameter will furnish at least a pint of water. The order of cutting\r\nmentioned above must invariably be adhered to, otherwise, if the upper\r\ncut be made first, the thirsty novice will find he has in his hand only\r\na piece of dry cork-like rope.\r\n\r\nIt is practically impossible to judge of the age of the huge trees in\r\nthese forests. Mighty with inherent strength, stayed to the ground and\r\nto their fellows by the numerous vines, sheltered and protected also by\r\ntheir fellows from the shock of storms, their huge trunks have little\r\nto do except support the direct weight of the tops, and they rarely\r\nfall until they have reached the last stages of decay. Then some day\r\nthe sudden impact of a ton or two of water dropped from some furious\r\ntropical shower, or the vibrations from a hurrying troop of monkeys, or\r\nthe spring of a tiger, is too much for one of the giant branches heavy\r\nwith its load of vines and parasites, and it gives way, breaking the\r\nvines in every direction and splitting a huge strip from the main\r\ntrunk. With its supports thus broken and the whole weight of the\r\nremaining branches on one side, the weakened trunk sways for a moment\r\nthen bows to its fate. The remaining vines break with the resistless\r\nstrain, and the old giant gathering velocity as he falls and dragging\r\nwith him everything in his reach, crashes to the earth with a roar\r\nwhich elicits cries of terror from bird and beast, and goes booming\r\nthrough the quivering forest like the report of a heavy cannon. A patch\r\nof blue sky overhead and a pile of impenetrable debris below, mark for\r\nyears the grave of the old hero.\r\n\r\nAs regards the insect and reptile pests of the country it has been my\r\nexperience that both their numbers and capacity for torment have been\r\ngreatly exaggerated. Mosquitoes, flies of various sizes, wasps and\r\nstinging ants exist, and the first in some places in large numbers; yet\r\nto a person who has any of the woodsman's craft of taking care of\r\nhimself, and whose blood is not abnormally sensitive to insect poisons,\r\nthey present no terrors and but slight annoyances. At our headquarters\r\ncamp on San Francisco island, we had no mosquitoes from sunrise to\r\nsunset, and even after sunset they were not especially numerous. At\r\nanother camp only a few miles away there were black flies only and no\r\nmosquitoes, at another both, while at the camps up in the hills there\r\nwere neither. It was only at camps in the wet lowlands and near swamps,\r\nthat they became an almost unendurable annoyance. Even here it was\r\nthose who remained in camp that suffered most. Men out in the thick\r\nbrush were but little annoyed by them, and when on their return to camp\r\nthey had finished their dinner and gotten into their mosquito bars they\r\nwere out of their reach. As to snakes, the danger from them even to a\r\nEuropean, is practically nothing. Not a man of the several hundred that\r\nhave been engaged in the various expeditions in that country has ever\r\nbeen bitten, and in hundreds of miles of tramping through the worst\r\nforests of the country, either entirely alone or if accompanied by\r\nnatives, with them some distance in the rear, I have never fancied\r\nmyself in danger. The poisonous snakes are invariably sluggish, and\r\nunless actually struck or stepped upon are apt to try to get out of the\r\nway, if they make any move. The only snake that is at all aggressive,\r\nas far as my observations go, is a long, black, non-poisonous snake.\r\nThis will sometimes advance upon the intruder with head raised a couple\r\nof feet from the ground, or if coiled about a tree will lash at him\r\nwith its tail.\r\n\r\nThe floral exhibit of these forests is apt to be disappointing to one\r\nwhose ideas have been formed by a perusal of books. An occasional\r\nscarlet passion flower; now and then the fragrant cluster of the _flor\r\ndel toro_; a few insignificant though fragrant flowering shrubs; and in\r\nmuddy sloughs near the streams, patches of wild callas; are about all\r\nthat meet the eye of the non-botanical wanderer in the deep forest.\r\n\r\nThere is not light enough for flowers beneath the dense canopy of\r\ntrees, and they, like the smaller birds, seek the tree tops and the\r\nbanks of the river where sunlight and air are abundant. In the tree\r\ntops the orchids and other flowering parasites run riot. Many of the\r\ntrees are themselves flowering, and if one can look down upon the tree\r\ntops of a valley in March or April, he sees the green expanse enlivened\r\nby blazing patches of crimson, yellow, purple, pink, and white.\r\n\r\nThe river banks are the favorite home of the flowering vines, and there\r\nthey form great curtains swaying from the trees in bright patterns of\r\nyellow, pink, red and white. The grassy banks and islands, and the\r\nshallow sand spits also bring forth innumerable varieties of aquatic\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Atlantic slope of the country.\r\n\r\nOn the west side between the Lake and the Pacific the work is very\r\ndifferent. There it is possible to ride mule-back to the top of a\r\ncommanding hill, sit down and make the reconnaissance sketch at\r\nleisure. The secondary reconnaissances may also be made mule-back, and\r\neverywhere the rolling country and the cleared and cultivated fields,\r\npermit the engineer to see where he is going and how he is going.\r\n\r\nHis surroundings are also different. He moves camp in an oxcart instead\r\nof a canoe. His eyes instead of being confined by the impenetrable veil\r\nof the tropical thicket, feast upon views of the distant mountains, the\r\ncrisp waves of the Lake, and the blue expanse of the Pacific. During\r\nthe day he meets black-eyed and brown-limbed señoritas, instead of wild\r\nhogs and turkeys, and at night as he turns in, he hears, not the scream\r\nof tigers, but the songs of the _lavandera's_ ecru daughters floating\r\nacross the stream which supplies their wash-tubs and his camp.\r\n\r\nThe first grand natural feature which arrests attention in the most\r\ncursory examination of the map of Nicaragua is the Great Lake. This\r\nlake with an area of some three thousand square miles and a water-shed\r\nof about eight thousand square miles, is unique in the large proportion\r\nof its own area to that of its water-shed. A result of this large\r\nproportion of water surface to drainage area, at once evident, is the\r\nvery gradual changes of level of the lake and their confinement within\r\nvery narrow limits. The difference between the level of the lake at the\r\nclose of an abnormally dry season and its level at the close of an\r\nabnormally wet season is not more than ten feet, and the usual annual\r\nfluctuation is about five feet.\r\n\r\nThe next features that arrest attention are, first, the very narrow\r\nribbon of land intervening between the western shore of the Lake and\r\nthe Pacific, and second, the entire absence of lateral tributaries of\r\nany size to the upper half of the San Juan River. The river is in fact,\r\nas it was originally most aptly named, simply the \"Desaguadero\" or\r\ndrain of the Lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO HIGHLANDS--RIVER SAN JUAN. _Julius Bien &\r\nCo._]\r\n\r\nThe length of this river is one hundred and twenty miles, from the Lake\r\nto the Caribbean Sea, and its total fall from one hundred to one\r\nhundred and ten feet. Nature has separated the river into two nearly\r\nequal divisions, presenting distinct and opposite characteristics.\r\n\r\nFrom Lake Nicaragua to the mouth of the Rio San Carlos, a distance of\r\nsixty-one miles, in which occur several rapids, the total descent is\r\nfifty feet, quite irregularly distributed however. The surface slopes\r\nof the river vary from as much as 83.38 inches per mile for a short\r\ndistance at Castillo rapids, to only .90 inch per mile through the Agua\r\nMuerte, the dead water below the Machuca rapids.\r\n\r\nThe average width of the river through this upper section is seven\r\nhundred feet, the minimum four hundred and twenty. In some parts of the\r\nAgua Muerte the depth varies from fifty to seventy-five feet.\r\n\r\nThere are very few islands in this section of the river, the banks are\r\ncovered with huge trees matted with vines, and throughout the lower\r\nhalf of the division, from Toro rapids to the mouth of the San Carlos,\r\nthe river is confined between steep hills and mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UPPER CASTILLO--RIVER SAN JUAN. _Julius Bien & Co._]\r\n\r\nAs a result of the absence of considerable tributaries already noted,\r\nthe fluctuations of this portion of the river conform closely to those\r\nof the Lake, and consequently take place gradually and are limited in\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nBelow the Rio San Carlos the San Juan changes its character entirely.\r\nIts average width is twelve hundred and fifty feet, its bottom is\r\nsandy, there are numerous islands, and the slope of the river is almost\r\nuniformly one foot per mile.\r\n\r\nThe discharge into this section of two large tributaries, the San\r\nCarlos and the Sarapiqui, descending from the steep slopes of the Costa\r\nRican volcanoes, causes much more sudden and considerable fluctuations\r\nof level than in the upper river.\r\n\r\nWhile the lower portion of the river and especially the delta section\r\npresents very interesting features, yet the peculiar charm of the river\r\nis in the upper section, and the exceptional advantages it offers for\r\nobtaining miles of slack water navigation. This portion of the river\r\nwith the lake and the narrow isthmus between it and the Pacific forms a\r\ntrio of natural advantages for the construction of a canal, the\r\nimportance of which it would be difficult to over estimate.\r\n\r\nAbout three miles below the mouth of the San Carlos, the Caño Machado\r\nenters the San Juan on the north bank. This stream, about one hundred\r\nfeet wide and from eight to ten feet deep, is the last of the mountain\r\nor torrential tributaries of the San Juan. It can scarcely be said to\r\nhave a valley, but occupies the bed of a rugged ravine extending for\r\nseveral miles northerly and northwesterly up into the easterly flank of\r\nthe cordillera. Every variety of igneous rock, from light porous pumice\r\nto dense metallic green-black hypersthene andesite, may be picked up in\r\nthe bed of this stream. Agates also are common and there are occasional\r\nmasses of jasper. Farther up, frequent outcrops of trap in situ occur,\r\ninterspersed in some localities with numerous veins of agate.\r\n\r\nTwelve miles below the Machado the San Francisco enters the San Juan.\r\nThis stream, with its several tributaries, drains a large swampy valley\r\nsprinkled with irregular hummocks and hills. For several miles from the\r\nSan Juan it is a sluggish, muddy stream between steep slippery banks;\r\nhigher up, flowing over a gravelly and then a rocky bed, it finally\r\ndisappears in steep ravines filled with huge bowlders. The main San\r\nFrancisco comes from the northwest, but a large tributary has its\r\nsource to the eastward in a range of hills which separates the San\r\nFrancisco basin from the immediate Caribbean water-shed. This range,\r\nunlike the ones already noted, is at heart an uninterrupted mass of\r\nhomogeneous hypersthene andesite, and with one exception nothing but\r\nfragments of trap or trap _in situ_, is to be found in any of the\r\nstreams descending from either its western or eastern slopes. The one\r\nexception is the Cañito Maria, a tributary of the San Francisco,\r\nentering it but little more than a mile from the San Juan. In the bed\r\nof this stream were abundant specimens of agates, jasper, and petrified\r\nwoods of several varieties in a wonderfully good state of preservation.\r\n\r\nThis range of hills ends at the Tamborcito bend of the San Juan, four\r\nmiles below the mouth of the San Francisco, and is the last easterly\r\nprojecting spur from the mountain backbone of the interior. Between it\r\nand the coast there are, however, mountain masses of equal or greater\r\nelevation, notably \"El Gigante\" and the Silico hills, the former some\r\nfifteen hundred feet high, but these are simply isolated mountain\r\nganglia, their innumerable radiating spurs speedily giving way to\r\nswamps or river valleys.\r\n\r\nThe streams that flow down the eastern slope of the Silico hills are,\r\nfrom their sources to the lowlands, of almost idyllic beauty. Beginning\r\nas noisy little brooks tumbling over black rocks in a V-shaped ravine\r\nnear the summit of the hills, they rapidly gather volume and slide\r\nalong in a polished channel of trap, tumbling every now and then as\r\nsheets of white spray over vertical ledges forming here and there deep\r\ngreen pools, and then after they have passed down among the foot-hills,\r\nrippling in broad shallow reaches over sunlit beds of bright yellow\r\ngravel. The water of these streams is clear and sparkling as that of an\r\nAlpine stream and apparently almost as cool. The insect pests of the\r\ntropics are unknown in the elevated portions of their valleys, and I\r\nhave slept more than once beside one of these streams, several hundred\r\nfeet above sea level, without a mosquito bar, while the delightful\r\n\"trades,\" rustling through the trees above me, brought the murmur of\r\nthe Caribbean surf miles away, to mingle with that of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe soil of this range consists, to a depth of ten to forty feet, of\r\nclay of various grades and colors, red prevailing. In the valleys this\r\nclay is almost invariably of a very dense consistency, and deep, dark\r\nred in color.\r\n\r\nFrom the foot-hills of the range to the coast, is a low level stretch\r\nof country, a dozen miles wide, interspersed with lagoons and swamps.\r\nNear the hills, where the elevation of the ground will average about\r\nfifteen feet above sea level, the soil is composed almost entirely of\r\nthe before mentioned red clay, which occasionally assumes the form of\r\nhummocks. Within about six miles of the coast this stratum of clay\r\ngradually disappears under a layer of sand, which is in turn covered,\r\nby a vegetable mould, to a depth of a few feet. From this point to the\r\nsea the average elevation is barely five feet above the sea level, and\r\nthe sand and mould above mentioned are the only materials met. A short\r\ndistance from the ocean the vegetable earth-covering disappears and\r\nonly the sand is left, extending to an unknown depth and reaching out\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nWest of Lake Nicaragua, from the Rio Lajas to Brito, as we leave the\r\nlake shore, the ground rises almost imperceptibly to the \"Divide\" among\r\ncleared and gently undulating fields. Then we drop into the sinuous\r\ngorge of the Rio Grande only to emerge, a few miles farther on, into\r\nthe upper end of the Rio Grande and Tola basin.\r\n\r\nTo the right the Tola valley stretches to the northward, and all around\r\nhigh and wooded hills encircle the valleys except directly in front\r\nwhere a narrow gateway in the coast hills opens to the Pacific. In the\r\nbottom of this valley are a few farms and through it wander devious\r\nroads. Beyond the narrow gateway in the hills, less than three miles of\r\nlevel swampy _salinas_ reach to the surf of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe views from the hills which flank the gateway of the Rio Grande, at\r\nLa Flor, are wonderfully attractive. I well remember one camp on the\r\nhillside, from which in one direction the eye takes in the fertile\r\nvalley of the Tola and Rio Grande, backed by the rolling hills of the\r\n\"Divide\" and over them the symmetrical peak of Ometepe, its base washed\r\nby the waves of the great lake. In the other direction the Pacific lies\r\napparently but a stone's throw below, the little port of Brito at one's\r\nvery feet.\r\n\r\nThis same camp inspired one young engineer and enthusiast to express\r\nhimself something as follows:\r\n\r\n\"What if, in this camp, we should, like Rip Van Winkle, sleep for ten\r\nyears, and then awakening look about us? We are still at Brito, but\r\ninstead of being in the wilderness, we look down upon a thriving city.\r\nIn the harbor are ships from all ports of the world. Ships from San\r\nFrancisco, bound for New York, about to pass through the canal and\r\nshorten their journey by 10,000 miles. Ships from Valparaiso, headed\r\nfor New York, which will take the short cut and save 5000 miles and the\r\ndread storms of Cape Horn. At many a masthead floats the British flag,\r\nand vessels from Liverpool, with their bows turned towards San\r\nFrancisco, have shortened their journey by 7000 miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"We go aboard one of the many steamers flying the 'stars and stripes'\r\nand start eastward. All along the line the face of the country has\r\nchanged; the fertile shores of the Tola basin are occupied by cacao\r\nplantations, fields have replaced forests, villages have grown to\r\ntowns, and factories driven by the exhaustless water power furnished by\r\nthe canal have sprung up on every available site.\"\r\n\r\n\"Along the shore of the lake are immense dry docks, and vessels are\r\nresting in this huge fresh water harbor before setting out again on\r\ntheir long voyages. The broad bosom of the noble San Juan is quivering\r\nwith the strokes of tireless propellors. The roar of the great dam at\r\nOchoa is heard for a moment and then the eastern section of the canal\r\nis entered. Here the country is scarcely recognizable so greatly has it\r\nchanged. Wilderness and marsh have disappeared, and only great fields\r\nof plantains and bananas and dark green orange groves are to be seen. A\r\nday from Brito and the steamer's bow is rising to the long blue swell\r\nof the Caribbean at Greytown.\"\r\n\r\nWell is this picture calculated to excite enthusiasm, for it means the\r\ndream of centuries realized, the cry of commerce answered, and our\r\nimperial Orient and Occident-facing Republic resting content with\r\ncoasts united from Eastport to the Strait of Fuca.",
