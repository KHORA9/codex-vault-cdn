He regarded her merely as a child, and assuming\r\na very superior air answered:\r\n\r\n“When you are as old as I am you will know everything—what is taking\r\nplace on the canal from Port Said to Suez, and all over Egypt.”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard anything about the Mahdi? I’ve heard that he is ugly and\r\nnaughty.”\r\n\r\nThe boy smiled condescendingly. “I don’t know whether he is ugly or not.\r\nThe Sudanese think he is handsome; but to call a man who has killed so\r\nmany people ‘naughty’—that is a word only a little girl, with short\r\ndresses reaching down to her knees, would use.”\r\n\r\n“Papa told me so, and papa knows best.”\r\n\r\n“He used that word in speaking to you because you would not have\r\nunderstood anything else. He would not have used it in speaking to me.\r\nThe Mahdi is worse than a hundred crocodiles. Do you understand what I\r\nsay? The word ‘naughty’ is a good word to use when talking to little\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\nBut when he saw the troubled look on the child’s face he said: “Nell,\r\nyou know that I don’t want to vex you. The time is coming when you will\r\nbe fourteen, too.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered, with an anxious expression. “What if the Mahdi\r\nshould take Port Said, and eat me?”\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi is not a cannibal and therefore does not eat people; he\r\nmurders them instead. Besides, he will never take Port Said; even if he\r\ndid capture it, and were to try to kill you, he would have me to deal\r\nwith.”\r\n\r\nThis assertion he made in a snarling tone, which augured no good to the\r\nMahdi, but it had the effect of apparently quieting Nell on the subject.\r\n“I know,” she answered, “that you would protect me. But why won’t they\r\nallow Fatima to leave Port Said?”\r\n\r\n“Because Fatima is the Mahdi’s cousin. Her husband told the Egyptian\r\nGovernment at Cairo that he would travel to Sudan, where the Mahdi was\r\nstaying, for the purpose of freeing all the Europeans who had fallen\r\ninto his hands.”\r\n\r\n“So Smain is good, then?”\r\n\r\n“Listen! Our fathers, who knew Smain very well, had no confidence in\r\nhim, and they warned Nubar Pasha not to trust him. But the government\r\nwas willing to send Smain there, and he has been six months with the\r\nMahdi. Still, not only did the captives not return, but, according to\r\nreports from Khartum, the Mahdists are treating them most cruelly; and\r\nSmain, after having received money from the government, has turned\r\ntraitor. He commanded the artillery of the Mahdi in the dreadful battle\r\nin which General Hicks fell, and he taught the Mahdists to use cannon,\r\nof which these savages knew nothing before. But Smain is now making\r\nevery effort to get his wife and children out of Egypt. Fatima, who knew\r\nbeforehand what Smain was trying to do, is said to have attempted to\r\nleave Port Said secretly, and that is why the government has imprisoned\r\nher and her children.”\r\n\r\n“What does the government want with Fatima and her children?”\r\n\r\n“The government intends to say to the Mahdi: ‘If you return those of our\r\npeople you have taken prisoners, we will give up Fatima.’ ” After this\r\nthey stopped talking, for birds flying in the direction from Echtum\r\nom-Farag toward Lake Menzaleh attracted Stasch’s attention. They flew\r\nrather low down in the clear air, and many pelicans could be seen\r\nstretching out their necks and slowly flapping their tremendous wings.\r\nStasch imitated their flight by raising his head very high, running\r\nalong the dam, and waving his outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n“Look! The flamingoes also are flying!” Nell suddenly exclaimed.\r\n\r\nStasch stopped a moment, for just behind the pelicans, but hovering a\r\nlittle higher in the air, might be seen two large objects, like red and\r\nrose-colored flowers.\r\n\r\n“Toward evening they fly to their home on the small island,” said the\r\nboy. “Oh, if I only had a gun!”\r\n\r\n“Why do you want to shoot them?”\r\n\r\n“Women never understand such things, but let us go on; perhaps we shall\r\nsee some more of them.”\r\n\r\nWith those words he took the little girl by the hand, and they went\r\nalong the first canal path behind Port Said, followed by Dinah, a\r\nnegress, who was formerly little Nell’s nurse. They went along the\r\nembankment that confines the waters of Lake Menzaleh, through which a\r\npilot had just taken an English steamer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  The sun soon set below the lake, whose salt water began\r\nto glimmer like gold. ]\r\n\r\nEvening was approaching. The sun was still rather high, but it soon set\r\nbelow the lake, whose salt water began to glimmer like gold and assume\r\nthe shimmering hues of a peacock’s plume. On the Arabian shore, as far\r\nas eye could see, stretched the gloomy, menacing, dead desert. Between\r\nthe glassy and motionless sky and the shoreless, furrowed stretch of\r\nsand there was not a sign of any living creature. While the canal\r\npresented a scene of great commercial activity—boats gliding past,\r\nsteamers whistling, and over the surface of Lake Menzaleh flocks of\r\nsea-gulls and wild ducks glistening in the moonlight—on the Arabian\r\nshore it was as desolate as a city of the dead. But the lower the sun\r\nsank, the redder the west became; even the sand-dunes were tinted with\r\nlilac color, resembling the heather found in the autumn woods of Poland.\r\n\r\nWalking toward the landing, the children saw several more flamingoes,\r\nand their eyes fairly danced with joy. Then Dinah said that Nell must go\r\nhome. In Egypt the days, which even in winter are very warm, are\r\nfollowed by cold nights, and as Nell’s health required great care, Mr.\r\nRawlison, her father, did not allow the child to remain near the water\r\nafter sundown; so they returned to the Rawlison villa, at the extreme\r\nend of the town, near the canal. Mr. Tarkowski, the father of Stasch,\r\nhad been invited to dine; he came in soon after, and then the whole\r\ncompany, including the French woman, Mrs. Olivier, Nell’s governess, sat\r\ndown to dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlison, a director of the Suez Canal Company, and Vladislaw\r\nTarkowski, chief engineer of the same company, had been very intimate\r\nfor many years. Both were widowers. Mrs. Tarkowski, a French lady, had\r\ndied giving birth to Stasch thirteen years before. Nell’s mother had\r\ndied of consumption in Heluan when her little girl was three years old.\r\nThe two widowers lived close by each other, and their business in Port\r\nSaid brought them in daily contact. Their mutual sorrows also cemented\r\ntheir old friendship. Mr. Rawlison loved Stasch as though he had been\r\nhis own son, and Mr. Tarkowski would have gone through fire and water\r\nfor little Nell. After their day’s work was done their greatest pleasure\r\nwas to talk about the education and the future of their children. While\r\nthey were conversing thus Mr. Rawlison would praise the capability,\r\nenergy, and precocity of Stasch, and Mr. Tarkowski express himself\r\nenthusiastically about Nell’s charm and her little angel face.\r\n\r\nBoth were correct in their views. Stasch was somewhat conceited and\r\nboastful, but quick in his studies, and the teachers of the English\r\nschool in Port Said prophesied a great future for him. He had inherited\r\naptitude and courage from his father, for Mr. Tarkowski possessed these\r\nqualities in a marked degree, and to them he owed his present high\r\nposition. He had taken an active part in the Polish revolution for\r\neleven months, then, being wounded and taken prisoner, he was banished\r\nto Siberia, from which he escaped and fled to a foreign country.\r\n\r\nBefore joining the insurrectionists he was graduated as an engineer. A\r\nyear after his escape he spent all his time studying hydraulics; then he\r\nobtained a position on the canal, and after several years, when his\r\nthorough knowledge, energy, and industry had become known, he was\r\npromoted to the position of chief engineer.\r\n\r\nStasch was born at Port Said, on the banks of the canal, was brought up\r\nthere, and had now attained his fourteenth year. For this reason the\r\nengineers and his father’s colleague called him “The Child of the\r\nDesert.” Later, in his school life, at vacation time, he often\r\naccompanied his father and Mr. Rawlison when they went on short business\r\ntrips from Port Said to Suez, which they were obliged to do in order to\r\nsuperintend the workmen on the dam and to direct the excavation of the\r\ncanal bed. He knew all the engineers and the custom-house officers, as\r\nwell as the workmen, the Arabs, and the negroes.\r\n\r\nHe went everywhere, even where no one would think of looking for him; he\r\nmade long excursions on the embankments, rowed his small boat on Lake\r\nMenzaleh, and often wandered far away. He would row across to the\r\nArabian shore and catch a horse, or not finding one, he would take a\r\ncamel, or even a donkey, to aid him in playing the fakir in the desert.\r\nIn a word, as Mr. Tarkowski would say, he ferreted into everything, and\r\nevery moment he had free from his studies he spent on the water. His\r\nfather did not remonstrate with him, for he knew that rowing, riding,\r\nand outdoor life would make the boy more robust and develop his\r\nenergies. Stasch was taller and stronger than most boys of his age. One\r\nglance at his eyes was enough to convince any one that he was more\r\ncourageous than cowardly.\r\n\r\nIn his fourteenth year he was the best swimmer in Port Said, which is\r\nsaying a great deal, for the Arabs and the negroes swim like fish. In\r\nshooting wild ducks and Egyptian geese with his small gun he had\r\nacquired a steady hand and a true eye.\r\n\r\nHis ambition was to shoot big game in Central Africa, and he listened\r\neagerly to the tales told by the Sudanese working on the canal, who\r\nhunted wild beasts in their native country. This intermingling with the\r\nSudanese gave him the advantage of learning their languages.\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal had not only to be dug, but also to be constantly\r\nwatched; otherwise the sand on either shore would fill it up within a\r\nyear. Lesseps’ great work demands continual vigilance and care, and\r\ntherefore powerful machines and thousands of men under the supervision\r\nof skilful engineers are still laboring daily, deepening its bed.\r\n\r\nIn excavating the canal twenty-five thousand workmen were employed, but\r\nnow that it is completed and machinery is so much improved, fewer men\r\nare necessary. There are, however, a considerable number still employed,\r\nchiefly natives, including Nubians, Sudanese, Somalis, and negroes of\r\ndifferent tribes living on the White and Blue Nile, over whom the\r\nEgyptian Government had ruled before the revolt of the Mahdi. Stasch\r\nlived on friendly terms with all of them, and, as is usually the case\r\nwith the Poles, he had a great gift for languages; thus he had picked up\r\nmany of their dialects without knowing when and where. Born in Egypt, he\r\nspoke Arabian like an Arab. From the natives of Zanzibar, who served as\r\nfiremen on the engines, he had learned the language which is spoken\r\nthroughout the greater part of Africa—the Ki-swahili dialect—and he\r\ncould make himself understood by the negroes of the Dinka and Schilluk\r\ntribes, who inhabit the upper half of Fashoda, on the Nile. He also\r\nspoke English, French, and Polish fluently; his father, an ardent\r\npatriot, had taken great care that his boy should be familiar with his\r\nown tongue. Stasch also considered this the most beautiful of all\r\nlanguages, and he was successful in teaching it to little Nell. But he\r\nwas never able to make her pronounce his name correctly. She would\r\nalways say “Stes” instead of Stasch, and this often caused a\r\nmisunderstanding, which only lasted until the little girl’s eyes filled\r\nwith tears, then “Stes” would ask her forgiveness, and was usually very\r\nangry with himself. But he had a disagreeable habit of referring\r\ndisdainfully to her eight years, and of contrasting his age and\r\nexperience with her youth. He asserted that a boy who had completed his\r\nthirteenth year, even if he were not entirely grown up, was at least no\r\nlonger a child, that he was capable of accomplishing all kinds of heroic\r\nexploits, especially if he had Polish and French blood in his veins, and\r\nthat he ardently wished for an opportunity to do such deeds, especially\r\nin Nell’s defense. Both children imagined all sorts of dangers, and\r\nStasch always knew how to meet her difficulties. For instance, what he\r\nwould do were a crocodile a dozen yards long, or a scorpion as large as\r\na dog, to creep into the house through the window. Neither of them had\r\nthe least idea that the terrible reality was soon to exceed their most\r\nfantastic conjectures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIn the meantime welcome news awaited them at home. Mr. Tarkowski and Mr.\r\nRawlison, being experienced engineers, had been invited a few weeks\r\nbefore to inspect and report on the works of the whole canal system in\r\nthe province of El-Fayoum, in the vicinity of Medinet, on Lake Karoon,\r\nas well as along the Yoosuf and the Nile rivers. They were going to\r\nremain there nearly a month, and had therefore procured leave of absence\r\nfrom their own company. As Christmas was near, they both decided that\r\nthey would not leave the children, and that Stasch and Nell should\r\naccompany them to Medinet. When the children heard the news they jumped\r\nup and down with joy. Until now they had only known about the cities\r\nbordering on the canal, such as Ismailia and Suez, and, on the other\r\nside of the lake, Alexandria and Cairo, from which they had visited the\r\ngreat Pyramids and the Sphinx. But these were short excursions, whereas\r\nthe expedition to Medinet-el-Fayoum was a whole day’s journey by train\r\nalong the Nile to the south, and then from El-Wasta to the west toward\r\nthe Libyan desert. Stasch knew Medinet from the description given by the\r\nyounger engineers and travelers, who went there to hunt all kinds of\r\nwaterfowl, as well as wolves and hyenas in the desert. He knew that the\r\ntown was a large isolated oasis on the left bank of the Nile, but that\r\nit was independent of the river’s overflow, having a water system of its\r\nown, formed by Lake Karoon and the Bahr-Yoosuf, and many small canals.\r\nEvery one who had seen the oasis said that although this strip of land\r\nbelongs to Egypt, it is separated from it by the desert, and seems to be\r\nan isolated spot. Only the river Yoosuf, like a thin blue ribbon,\r\nconnects this district with the Nile valley. The great abundance of\r\nwater, the fertility of the land, and the luxuriant vegetation make it\r\nan earthly paradise, and the extensive ruins of the ancient city of\r\nCrocodilopolis attract hundreds of curious travelers. Stasch was\r\nespecially charmed with the shores of Lake Karoon, with its flocks of\r\nbirds, and by the wolf-hunting expeditions in the desert hills of\r\nJebel-el-Sedment.\r\n\r\nStasch’s vacation would not begin until a few days later, but as the\r\ninspection of the works on the canal was pressing, the fathers had no\r\ntime to lose; so it was decided that they were to leave at once, and\r\nthat the children, together with Mrs. Olivier, should follow them a week\r\nlater. Nell and Stasch wanted to start at once, but Stasch did not\r\nventure to coax to go with them. For this reason they began to study and\r\nto inform themselves about everything concerning the journey, and it was\r\nwith great joy that they learned they would not have to live in\r\nuncomfortable hotels kept by Greeks, but in tents placed at their\r\ndisposal by Messrs. Cook & Co., traveling agents. For travelers from\r\nCairo to Medinet, and also for people who intend staying there for any\r\nlength of time, the company supplies tents, servants, cooks, provisions,\r\nhorses, camels, donkeys, and guides, so as to relieve the traveler of\r\nall care. This is indeed an expensive way of traveling, but Mr.\r\nTarkowski and Mr. Rawlison were not obliged to think of this, because\r\nall expenses were paid by the Egyptian Government, which had asked them,\r\nas experts, to inspect and report on the canal works.\r\n\r\nNell, whose greatest pleasure was riding a camel, made her father\r\npromise to get her one, on which she, in company with Mrs. Olivier or\r\nDinah, and sometimes Stasch, might go along with the excursions to the\r\nborders of the desert and to Lake Karoon. Mr. Tarkowski promised Stasch\r\nthat some time he would allow him to hunt wolves by night, and if he\r\nreceived a good report at school he would get him a genuine English\r\nshotgun and an entire hunting outfit. As Stasch was sure of having a\r\ngood report, he immediately imagined himself the possessor of the gun,\r\nand resolved to accomplish difficult and wonderful and unheard-of deeds.\r\n\r\nThe happy children conversed about these things and made plans during\r\nthe entire dinner. Mrs. Olivier was not at all enthusiastic about the\r\ncoming journey, for she felt no desire to leave the comfortable villa in\r\nPort Said. At the very thought of living in tents, and especially at the\r\nprospect of taking excursions on camels, she began to be frightened. She\r\nhad made several attempts to take similar rides—such as Europeans\r\nliving in Egypt usually take—but it had always ended disastrously. Once\r\nthe camel had stood up too soon, and as she had not settled herself in\r\nthe saddle she slid from his back to the ground. Another time a\r\ndromedary, which is not accustomed to light burdens, shook her up so\r\nthat she did not recover for two days. Nell, on the other hand, after\r\ntwo or three rides that her father had allowed her to take, declared\r\nthat there was nothing in the world more delightful. But Mrs. Olivier\r\nhad nothing but unpleasant memories of her rides. She said that it was\r\nall right for Arabs, or for such little crabs as Nell, who felt the\r\nshaking no more than a fly that had alighted on the camel’s hump; but\r\nfor older people, the serious and rather heavy people who are sure to be\r\nseasick, it was a very different matter.\r\n\r\nBut she also had other reasons to be alarmed when she thought of\r\nMedinet-el-Fayoum. In Port Said, as well as in Alexandria, Cairo, and in\r\nfact throughout Egypt, people talked of nothing else but the revolt of\r\nthe Mahdi and of the cruel deeds of the Dervishes. Although Mrs. Olivier\r\ndid not exactly know where Medinet was, she felt uneasy lest it might be\r\nin too close proximity to the Mahdists, and at last she asked Mr.\r\nRawlison.\r\n\r\nBut he only smiled and said:\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi is at present besieging Khartum, which is defended by General\r\nGordon. Do you know how far it is from Medinet to Khartum?”\r\n\r\n“I have not the least idea.”\r\n\r\n“About as far as from here to Sicily,” replied Mr. Tarkowski.\r\n\r\n“Almost,” corrected Stasch. “Khartum lies at the junction of the White\r\nNile and the Blue Nile. Much of Egypt and the whole length of Abyssinia\r\nseparate us from it.”\r\n\r\nHe was on the point of adding that even if Medinet lay nearer the\r\ndistricts most affected by the insurrection, he would always be there\r\nwith his rifle, but when he remembered that he had been repeatedly\r\nreproved by his father for similar bragging he was silent.\r\n\r\nThe two fathers began conversing about the Mahdi and the insurrection,\r\nfor this was the most important news concerning Egypt. The news from\r\nKhartum was not encouraging. The savage tribes had now besieged the town\r\nfor nearly a month and a half. The English and Egyptian government\r\nofficials were slow to act; the relief army had scarcely started; and\r\neverybody thought that, notwithstanding Gordon’s fame, heroism, and\r\nability, this important town would fall into the hands of the\r\nbarbarians. Mr. Tarkowski, who suspected that England would be only too\r\nglad if the Mahdi were to conquer southern Egypt, so that they might\r\nrecapture it from the Mahdi and convert this enormous tract into an\r\nEnglish settlement, was of the same opinion. But he did not say this to\r\nMr. Rawlison for fear of wounding his patriotic feelings.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner was nearly finished, Stasch inquired why the Egyptian\r\nGovernment had annexed all the land south of Nubia—Kordofan, Darfur,\r\nand Sudan as far as the Albert-Nyanza, and why it had robbed the\r\ninhabitants of their liberty. Mr. Rawlison determined to explain this to\r\nhim, because every move by the Egyptian Government was made at the\r\ncommand of England, which had extended her protectorate over Egypt and\r\nruled it as she pleased.\r\n\r\n“The Egyptian Government has deprived no one of his liberty,” said he,\r\n“but instead has returned it to hundreds, thousands, and perhaps\r\nmillions. A short time ago there were no independent towns in Kordofan,\r\nDarfur, and Sudan, except here and there where some small potentate\r\nasserted his rights to several districts and appropriated them by force,\r\nagainst the will of the inhabitants. But on the whole they were\r\ninhabited by independent tribes of Arabo-Negroes; that is to say, by\r\npeople having the blood of both these races in their veins. These tribes\r\nwere perpetually fighting with one another. They would attack one\r\nanother, steal horses, cattle, and especially slaves. At the same time\r\nmany atrocious deeds were committed, but the most desperate of these men\r\nwere those who hunted for ivory and for slaves. They formed, as it were,\r\na class apart, and to this class nearly all the chiefs of the tribes and\r\nthe prosperous merchants belonged. These men led armed reconnoitering\r\nparties into the interior of Africa, and stole ivory tusks and took\r\nthousands of people—men, women, and children—captive. They also\r\ndestroyed villages, settlements, and fields, and spilled rivers of\r\nblood; they mercilessly massacred every one who made any show of\r\nresistance; so much so that the southern part of Sudan, Darfur, and\r\nKordofan, and also the districts of the upper Nile as far as the lakes,\r\nwere almost depopulated in places. But the Arabs advanced still farther,\r\nso that nearly the whole of central Africa was converted into a vale of\r\ntears and blood. Therefore England, which, as you know, pursues all\r\nslave dealers in every part of the world, agreed that the Egyptian\r\nGovernment should occupy Kordofan, Darfur, and Sudan, for that was the\r\nonly way to force these thieves to stop their gruesome slave-trading.\r\nThe unhappy negroes breathed freely once more, and, as they were no\r\nlonger afraid of being robbed and attacked, they settled down to some\r\ndegree of law and order. Apparently this state of affairs did not please\r\nthe traders, so when Mohammed Achmed—now called the Mahdi—appeared in\r\ntheir midst, under the pretext that Mohammedanism in Egypt was on the\r\ndecline, and proclaimed the Holy War, all the men of one accord took up\r\narms, and thus the terrible war began, in which, until now, the\r\nEgyptians have fared very badly. The Mahdi has beaten the Egyptian\r\ntroops in every battle, and has taken possession of Kordofan, Darfur,\r\nand Sudan; his tribes are now besieging Khartum and advancing as far\r\nnorth as the borders of Nubia.”\r\n\r\n“And is it possible that they can reach Egypt?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Mr. Rawlison. “The Mahdi, it is true, has proclaimed that\r\nhe will conquer the whole world, but he is a barbarian and does not know\r\nwhat he is talking about. He can not conquer Egypt, for England will not\r\npermit it.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose the Egyptian army be worsted?”\r\n\r\n“Then the English troops, which are invincible, will appear on the\r\nscene.”\r\n\r\n“And why did England permit the Mahdi to take possession of so many\r\ndistricts?”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that she permitted him?” answered Mr. Rawlison.\r\n“England never acts in haste, for she is a great nation.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation was now interrupted by the negro servant, who announced\r\nthat Fatima Smain was there and that she earnestly begged an audience.\r\nThe women of the Orient practically confine their energies to household\r\nmatters, and rarely leave the harem. Only the poorer ones go to market\r\nor work in the fields like the wives of the fellahs (Egyptian peasants),\r\nand they veil their faces. In Sudan, where Fatima came from, this was\r\nnot the custom, and although she had been to Mr. Rawlison’s office\r\nbefore, her appearance in a private house, and especially at this late\r\nhour, seemed rather peculiar.\r\n\r\n“We shall learn something new about Smain,” said Mr. Tarkowski.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mr. Rawlison, at the same time motioning the servant to\r\nusher in Fatima.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds there appeared a tall, young Sudanese woman; her dark,\r\nbeautiful face, with its wild, tragic, and prophetic eyes, was unveiled.\r\nOn entering she immediately fell on her face, and when Mr. Rawlison\r\nordered her to arise she assumed a kneeling position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  “Her dark, beautiful face, with its wild, prophetic\r\neyes, was unveiled. When Mr. Rawlison ordered her to arise she assumed a\r\nkneeling position.” ]\r\n\r\n“Sidi,” she began, “may Allah bless you, your heirs, your house, and\r\nyour flocks.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Pity, deliverance, and help in time of trouble. Oh, sir, I am\r\nimprisoned in Port Said, and destruction hovers over me and my\r\nchildren!”\r\n\r\n“You say you are imprisoned, and yet you are able to come here even at\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“The Sabties, who guard my house day and night, led me here, and I’m\r\nsure they have been ordered to cut off our heads very soon.”\r\n\r\n“Talk like a sensible woman,” answered Mr. Rawlison, frowning. “You are\r\nnot in Sudan, but in Egypt, where no one is killed without a judicial\r\nsentence, and so you can rest assured that not a hair of your head or of\r\nyour children’s will be touched.”\r\n\r\nHowever, she besought him once more to intercede for her with the\r\nEgyptian Government, and obtain permission for her to travel to meet\r\nSmain. “The English are as great as you, sir,” she said; “they are able\r\nto accomplish anything. The government in Cairo thinks that Smain is\r\nguilty of treason, but that is not true. Yesterday I talked with Arabian\r\nmerchants, who came from Suakim, after having bought rubber and ivory in\r\nSudan, and they told me that Smain lies ill in El-Fasher and bids me and\r\nthe children come to him, so that he may bless us.”\r\n\r\n“Fatima, you have invented this tale,” interrupted Mr. Rawlison.\r\n\r\nShe now began to protest by Allah that she was telling the truth, and\r\nthen she said that were Smain to recover he would certainly buy the\r\nfreedom of all the Christian prisoners, and if he were to die then\r\nshe—as a relative of the leader of the Dervishes—would easily gain\r\nadmission to him, and be able to obtain anything she asked. If only she\r\nmight travel to join her husband, for her heart bled longing to see him!\r\nWhat had she, unhappy woman done against the government or the Khedive?\r\nShe asked if it were her fault, and if she could have prevented her\r\nmisfortune in being the relative of the Dervish, Mohammed Achmed.\r\n\r\nFatima did not dare, before Englishmen, to call her relative “the\r\nMahdi,” as that name means “Saviour of the World”; and she knew that the\r\nEgyptian Government looked upon him as a rebel and a schemer.\r\nContinually bowing and calling on heaven to witness her innocence and\r\nher misfortune, she began to weep piteously, just as women of the Orient\r\nare accustomed to do on the death of their husbands or sons. Then she\r\nthrew herself on her face on the ground, or, speaking more correctly, on\r\nthe carpet which covered the inlaid floor, and remained silent.\r\n\r\nNell, who had felt somewhat sleepy toward the end of dinner, was now\r\nwide awake, and, as she had a kind heart, she took her father’s hand,\r\nand kissing it over and over again, begged him to say a word in Fatima’s\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you help her, papa? Help her!”\r\n\r\nAnd Fatima, who seemed to understand English, said between her sobs,\r\nwithout raising her head from the carpet:\r\n\r\n“May Allah bless you, you little flower of paradise, Omaj’s delight!\r\nLittle star without blemish!”\r\n\r\nAlthough Stasch in his heart of hearts was very angry with the Mahdists,\r\nhe was touched by Fatima’s request and by her sorrow. Besides, Nell had\r\nspoken for her, and he always ended by doing what she wanted, and so he\r\nsaid in an undertone, but still loud enough for all to hear:\r\n\r\n“If I were the government, I would allow Fatima to leave.”\r\n\r\n“But as you are not the government,” answered Mr. Tarkowski, “you had\r\nbetter not interfere in things that don’t concern you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlison also had a compassionate heart, and he felt much sympathy\r\nfor Fatima, but various things she had said seemed to him to be\r\ndownright lies. As he practically did business daily in connection with\r\nthe custom-house in Ismailia, he knew very well that no cargoes of\r\nrubber or ivory had passed through the canal lately. The trade in these\r\ngoods had almost ceased. Besides, he knew that Arabian merchants could\r\nnot return from the town El-Fasher, in Sudan, for from the beginning of\r\nthe war the Mahdists absolutely refused to let merchants pass, and those\r\nthey caught they robbed and took prisoners. Besides, it was almost\r\ncertain that the tale of Smain’s illness was a lie.\r\n\r\nBut as Nell continued to look beseechingly at her father, the latter,\r\nnot wishing to sadden the girl, said to Fatima:\r\n\r\n“Fatima, I have, as you requested, written to the government, but have\r\nreceived no answer as yet. And now listen. To-morrow we are going with\r\nthe Mehendis (engineers) to Medinet-el-Fayoum. On the way we shall\r\nremain a day in Cairo, for the Khedive wishes to speak to us and give us\r\norders about things concerning the canal, which is being directed from\r\nBahr-Yoosuf. During the conversation I will try to tell him your\r\nposition and gain his good will for you; but I can do no more, and I can\r\nnot promise anything.”\r\n\r\nFatima arose, and stretching out both hands in thanks, she cried out:\r\n\r\n“And so I’m saved!”\r\n\r\n“No, Fatima,” replied Mr. Rawlison, “do not speak of deliverance, for I\r\nhave already told you that neither you nor your children are threatened\r\nwith death. But whether or not the Khedive will permit you to depart I\r\ncan not tell, for Smain is not ill, but a traitor, who, after having\r\ntaken with him the government’s money, has not the least idea of\r\nredeeming the prisoners taken by Mohammed Achmed.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, Smain is innocent, and he is in El-Fasher,” repeated Fatima; “and\r\neven if he had been unfaithful to the government, I swear to you, my\r\nbenefactor, that if I am permitted to leave I shall plead with Mohammed\r\nuntil I have succeeded in making him release your prisoners.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; I promise you once more that I will intercede for you with\r\nthe Khedive.”\r\n\r\nFatima began to bow very low.\r\n\r\n“Sidi, I thank you. You are not only powerful, but just. And now I beg\r\nyou to let us serve you as slaves.”\r\n\r\n“In Egypt there are no slaves,” answered Mr. Rawlison with a smile. “I\r\nhave servants enough, and besides, I would not be able to give you a\r\nposition as servant, for, as I have already told you, we are going to\r\nMedinet, and we may stay there till the feast of Ramadan.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I know it, for the overseer Chadigi told me; and when I heard it I\r\nnot only came to beg you for help, but also to tell you that two men of\r\nmy tribe (the Dangali), Idris and Gebhr, are camel-drivers in Medinet,\r\nand that as soon as you reach there they will place themselves and their\r\ncamels at your disposal.”\r\n\r\n“Good, good!” answered the director; “but the Cook Company is attending\r\nto all these details for us.”\r\n\r\nKissing the hands of the two gentlemen and the children, Fatima\r\ndeparted, blessing Nell as she went. The two engineers were silent for a\r\nwhile and then Mr. Rawlison said:\r\n\r\n“Poor woman! She tells lies such as no one outside of the Orient would\r\ndream of. Even in her shower of thanks a false note is heard.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered Mr. Tarkowski. “But it is also true that, whether\r\nSmain be a traitor or not, the government has no right to detain her in\r\nEgypt, for she is not responsible for her husband’s acts.”\r\n\r\n“The government at this time does not permit any Sudanese to travel to\r\nSuakim and Nubia without permission, and this does not apply to Fatima\r\nonly. There are many Sudanese in Egypt; they came here to make money,\r\nand among them are a certain number belonging to the Dangali tribe, from\r\nwhich the Mahdi comes. For instance, to it belong not only Fatima, but\r\nChadigi and those two camel-drivers in Medinet. The Mahdists say the\r\nEgyptians are Turks, and are at war with them, and among the Arabs\r\nsettled here are numerous followers of the Mahdi, who would like to go\r\nover to his side if they dared. They include all fanatics, all followers\r\nof Arabi Pasha, and many of the poorer classes. They are at outs with\r\nthe government for having submitted to English influence, and pretend\r\ntheir religion suffers in consequence. Heaven knows how many have\r\nalready fled by way of the desert, and by so doing have avoided the\r\nusual water route to Suakim, and as the government found out that Fatima\r\nhad attempted to escape also, it ordered her to be placed under guard.\r\nOnly by exchanging her and her children—as they are related to the\r\nMahdi—for our men captured by them may we hope to get them back.”\r\n\r\n“Do the lower classes in Egypt really sympathize with the Mahdi?”\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi has followers even among our soldiers, and perhaps that is\r\nthe reason they fight so badly.”\r\n\r\n“But how can the Sudanese escape by way of the desert? It is thousands\r\nof miles long.”\r\n\r\n“And yet slaves have been brought into Egypt that way.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe that Fatima’s children could stand a journey like\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“But she will make it shorter by crossing over to Suakim.”\r\n\r\n“All the same, she is a poor woman.”\r\n\r\nThus the conversation ended.\r\n\r\nAnd twelve hours later, after the “poor woman” had carefully locked\r\nherself in her house with the son of the overseer Chadigi, with raised\r\neyebrows and a lowering glance in her lovely eyes, she whispered:\r\n\r\n“Chamis, son of Chadigi, take this money; start to-day for Medinet, and\r\ngive Idris this writing, which, at my request, the holy Dervish Ballali\r\nwrote to him. The children of these Mehendisi are good (i.e., good\r\nmaterial to be used to further our ends)—there is no other way—if I\r\ncan not gain permission to travel. I know that you will not betray\r\nme. . . . Remember that you and your father belong to the Dangali tribe,\r\nthe same tribe to which the Mahdi belongs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nOn the following day the two engineers left for Cairo to visit the\r\nEnglish residents, and also to have an audience with the viceroy. Stasch\r\ncalculated that this might take two days; he was right, for on the\r\nevening of the third day he received the following telegram, sent from\r\nMedinet by his father: “The tents are ready. Start when your holidays\r\nbegin. Send word to Fatima by Chadigi that we were unable to do anything\r\nfor her.” Mrs. Olivier received a similar telegram, and so she, assisted\r\nby Dinah, began at once to prepare for the journey. The children were\r\noverjoyed to see the packing going on, but suddenly something occurred\r\nthat upset all their plans and came near preventing their departure. For\r\nduring the first day of Stasch’s winter vacation, on the evening of\r\nwhich they had planned to make their departure, Mrs. Olivier, when\r\ntaking her afternoon nap in the garden, was bitten by a scorpion, and\r\nalthough the bite of this poisonous creature is not so dangerous in\r\nEgypt, in this case it might prove very serious. The scorpion had crept\r\nover the back of a canvas chair and bitten her in the neck just as she\r\nhad mashed it with her head; and as she had formerly suffered from\r\nerysipelas, it was feared that she might have a relapse. A doctor was\r\nimmediately summoned, but as he was busy elsewhere, he did not arrive\r\nfor two hours. By this time her neck and even her face were swollen, and\r\nshe had a fever accompanied by the usual symptoms of poison. The doctor\r\nexplained that under these circumstances she must not dream of going,\r\nand he ordered her to bed; and so it seemed as though the children would\r\nhave to spend their Christmas at home. But to Nell’s credit be it said,\r\nshe thought more—especially at first—about the sufferings of her\r\ngoverness than the pleasures she would miss by not going to Medinet. But\r\nwhen she realized that she could not see her father again for several\r\nweeks she wept in secret. Stasch did not take the matter so\r\nphilosophically, and so he sent a telegram followed by a letter asking\r\nwhat was to be done. Mr. Rawlison, after having communicated with the\r\ndoctor and learning from him that there was no immediate danger and that\r\nhe had only forbidden Mrs. Olivier to leave Port Said because he feared\r\nthe erysipelas might set in again, first arranged for her to have every\r\ncare and comfort and then gave the children permission to start on the\r\njourney with Dinah. But as Dinah, notwithstanding her boundless\r\naffection for Nell, was scarcely competent to take charge of the journey\r\nand make arrangements for them in the hotel, Stasch was to be guide and\r\ncashier. One can readily imagine how proud he was of this rôle, and with\r\nwhat lordly pride he assured Nell that not a hair of her head would be\r\ntouched, as if the road to Cairo and Medinet presented no difficulties\r\nor dangers.\r\n\r\nAs everything was now ready, the children left that very day, traveling\r\nby the canal to Ismailia, and from there by train to Cairo, where they\r\nwere to spend the night and be ready to go on to Medinet the following\r\nday. When they left Ismailia they saw Timsah Lake, which Stasch had seen\r\nbefore; for Mr. Tarkowski, who was a very enthusiastic hunter in his\r\nleisure hours, sometimes took him along to shoot water-birds. Then the\r\nroad followed the Wadi Tumilat, close by the fresh-water canal which\r\nconnects the Nile with Ismailia and Suez. This canal was dug before the\r\nSuez Canal; if it had not been, the workmen employed in Lesseps’ great\r\nundertaking would not have had a drop of water to drink. The digging of\r\nthis canal had another good result: the stretch of land, which had been\r\na barren waste before, now blossomed once more when the wide and rapid\r\nstream of fresh water flowed through it. From the car windows the\r\nchildren saw a large belt of vegetation on the left side, consisting of\r\nmeadows on which horses, camels, and sheep were grazing, and plowed\r\nfields, Turkish wheat, millet, alfa, and other species of grain and\r\nfield plants. On the bank of the canal could be seen all kinds of wells,\r\nabove which were large wheels fitted up with pails or ordinary cranes\r\nthat drew up the water, which the fellahs assiduously spread over the\r\nbeds or carried away in barrels on little wagons drawn by buffaloes.\r\nOver the sprouting grain-seeds hovered doves and sometimes flocks of\r\nquail. On the edges of the canal storks and cranes walked gravely up and\r\ndown. In the distance, over the clay huts of the fellahs, towered crowns\r\nof date-palms that looked like large feather dusters.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, north of the railway lay a wilderness, but it did not\r\nresemble the one on the other side of the Suez Canal. That looked like\r\nthe flat sandy bed of a dried-up sea, while here the sand was more\r\nyellow, and was piled up into large hillocks covered with scanty\r\nvegetation. Between these hillocks, which in places attained a great\r\nheight, lay broad valleys, through which now and then caravans were seen\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nFrom the car windows the children saw loaded camels walking single file\r\nin a long line. In front of each camel strode an Arab in black coat and\r\nwhite turban. Little Nell remembered the pictures she had seen in the\r\nBible at home, which represented the Israelites and described how they\r\njourneyed to Egypt in the time of Joseph. They seemed just like these\r\nmen. Unfortunately, she could not get a very good look at the caravans,\r\nbecause two English officers sat near the windows, which obstructed her\r\nview.\r\n\r\nShe had no sooner told Stasch of this than, turning to the officers,\r\nvery seriously, and touching his hat, he said:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, would you mind making room for this little lady, who would\r\nlike to look at the camels?”\r\n\r\nThe two officers listened with all due seriousness, and one of them not\r\nonly made room for the curious “little lady,” but lifted her up and put\r\nher on the seat next the window.\r\n\r\nStasch immediately began to lecture.\r\n\r\n“That is the old district of Gessen,” said Stasch, “that Pharao gave\r\nJoseph for his brethren, the Israelites. Once, in fact very long ago,\r\nthere was a fresh-water canal here, so that this new one is only the old\r\none rebuilt. Later it was destroyed and the country became a desert. Now\r\nthe ground is becoming fertile again.”\r\n\r\n“How does the gentleman know this?” asked one of the officers.\r\n\r\n“Nowadays people know these things,” replied Stasch; “and besides,\r\nProfessor Sterling lectured to us long ago on Wadi Tumilat.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Stasch spoke English very fluently, he had a rather peculiar\r\naccent; this attracted the attention of the second officer, who asked:\r\n\r\n“Is not the young gentleman an Englishman?”\r\n\r\n“This little lady is Miss Nell, whom her father has placed in my care\r\nduring the journey. I am not an Englishman, but a Pole, and a son of one\r\nof the engineers of the canal.”\r\n\r\nThe officer smiled at this answer, which the boy gave disjointedly, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“I esteem the Poles very highly. I belong to a regiment of cavalry that\r\nin Napoleon’s day fought side by side with the Polish Uhlans in several\r\nbattles, the memory of which, even to the present day, is enshrined in\r\nhonor and glory.”[1]\r\n\r\n“I am pleased to meet you,” answered Stasch.\r\n\r\nThe conversation ran along pleasantly, for the officers seemed to be\r\nentertained. It happened that these officers were traveling from Port\r\nSaid to Cairo, to see the English ambassador and to receive from him\r\nfinal instructions in regard to the long journey which lay before them.\r\nThe younger of the two was a doctor in the army, and the one who talked\r\nto Stasch, Captain Glen, was traveling from Cairo by way of Suez to\r\nMombasa, where he was to rule over the entire district surrounding this\r\nharbor, which stretched out as far as the Samburuland and Rudolf Lake.\r\nStasch, who enjoyed reading stories of African travels, knew that\r\nMombasa lay several degrees beyond the equator. He knew, too, that the\r\nbordering countries, although the English now find them interesting, are\r\nreally but little known, being quite wild, full of elephants, giraffes,\r\nrhinoceroses, buffaloes, and all kinds of antelopes, which are\r\nconstantly seen by army merchants and missionary expeditions. So the boy\r\nenvied Captain Glen from the bottom of his heart and promised to visit\r\nhim in Mombasa, so that he might hunt lions and buffaloes with him.\r\n\r\n“All right, but I beg for a visit from this little lady,” answered\r\nCaptain Glen, laughing and pointing to Nell, who had just left the\r\nwindow to sit down beside him.\r\n\r\n“Miss Rawlison has her father,” answered Stasch, “and I am only taking\r\ncare of her during the journey.”\r\n\r\nThereupon the second officer turned round suddenly and asked: “Rawlison?\r\nIs he not the canal director who has a brother in Bombay?”\r\n\r\n“My uncle lives in Bombay,” answered Nell, raising a finger.\r\n\r\n“In that case, my dear, your uncle is married to my sister. My name is\r\nClary. We are related, and I am heartily glad that I have met you and\r\nmade your acquaintance, little one.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor was very much pleased. He said that as soon as he arrived in\r\nPort Said he had inquired for Mr. Rawlison at the director’s office, but\r\nwas told that he had gone away for the holidays. He also expressed his\r\nregret that the ship in which he and Glen were going to Mombasa was to\r\nsail from Suez in a few days, and so he would be unable to take a trip\r\nto Medinet. He asked Nell to remember him to her father, and promised to\r\nwrite to her from Mombasa.\r\n\r\nThe two officers now directed most of their conversation to Nell, so\r\nthat Stasch was somewhat in the background. At every station dozens of\r\noranges, fresh dates, and even excellent sherbet were served. Stasch and\r\nNell did full justice to these good things, as did Dinah also, for among\r\nher other excellent qualities was an unusual fondness for eating.\r\n\r\nIn this way the journey to Cairo passed very quickly. The officers on\r\nleaving kissed Nell’s little hands and head, and shook Stasch by the\r\nhand, and then Captain Glen, who admired the resolute boy very much,\r\nsaid, half in earnest and half in jest:\r\n\r\n“Listen, my boy! Who knows where, when, and under what circumstances we\r\nmay meet again? But remember that you can always count on my good will\r\nand my help.”\r\n\r\n“And I can promise the same to you, sir,” answered Stasch, making a\r\ndignified bow.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\nThe English mounted troops which fought with the Polish cavalry against\r\nNapoleon boast of it even to this day, and the officers, when speaking\r\nof their regiment, never fail to say, “We fought with the Poles.”—S.\r\nChevrillon, “Aux Indes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMr. Tarkowski and Mr. Rawlison, who loved his little Nell more than his\r\nlife, were delighted at the arrival of the children. The two young\r\npeople greeted their fathers with equal enthusiasm, and at once began to\r\ninspect the tents, the interiors of which were all completely fitted up\r\nand prepared to welcome the beloved guests. They saw that the tents were\r\nas spacious as large rooms, handsomely fitted with a double roof, lined\r\nwith blue and red flannel, and that the floors were covered with rugs.\r\nThe Cook Company, which was so well thought of by the high officials of\r\nthe canal, had done all in their power to make things comfortable and\r\npleasant for them. At first Mr. Rawlison had feared that a lengthy stay\r\nin the tent might injure Nell’s health, but at last he gave his consent,\r\nbecause in bad weather they could always move to the hotel. But now,\r\nhaving taken a good look at everything, including the surroundings, he\r\ncame to the conclusion that the days and nights spent in the open air\r\nwould be a hundred times better for his only daughter than the gloomy\r\nrooms of a small town hotel. They were also fortunate in having fine\r\nweather. Medinet, surrounded on all sides by the sandy hills of the\r\nLibyan desert, has a far better climate than Cairo, and is not named\r\n“land of roses” without good reason. As a result of its protected\r\nposition, and because of the moisture in the air, the nights are not\r\nnearly so cold as in other southernly parts of Egypt, and the winter is\r\nreally delightful. In November the vegetation is most luxuriant.\r\nDate-palms, olives (not many of which are found in Egypt), figs and\r\norange-trees, enormous nuts, pomegranates, and various other southern\r\nplants cover this beautiful oasis like a forest. The gardens are fairly\r\noverrun with acacias, lilacs, and roses, so that during the night every\r\nbreath of air carries their overpowering perfume. One breathes here from\r\nthe bottom of one’s lungs, and “does not want to die,” as the natives\r\nsay. Heluan, on the opposite bank of the Nile, is the only other place\r\nwith a similar climate, although it is situated much farther north, and\r\ntherefore the vegetation is not so luxuriant.\r\n\r\nBut Heluan had sad associations for Mr. Rawlison, for it was there that\r\nNell’s mother had died. Therefore he preferred Medinet, and as he looked\r\nat the beaming face of the little girl he resolved to buy some land and\r\na garden here, to build a comfortable English house, and to spend every\r\nholiday he could procure in this favored spot, and perhaps, when his\r\nservices were no longer necessary on the canal, to make this his\r\npermanent residence. But these were embryo plans for the distant future.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the children had been flitting about like flies ever since\r\ntheir arrival, for they wanted to see all the tents, as well as the\r\ndonkeys and camels hired by Cook, before dinner-time. But it so happened\r\nthat the animals were grazing some distance away, so that the children\r\ncould not see them until the next day. On the other hand, to compensate\r\nthem for their disappointment, Nell and Stasch were delighted to see\r\nChamis, the son of Chadigi, their good friend from Port Said. He was not\r\none of Cook’s servants, and even Mr. Rawlison was surprised to see him\r\nin Medinet, but as he had previously employed Chamis to carry his\r\ninstruments, he took him along now to run errands and perform other\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThe evening meal proved to be very good, for the old Copt, who for\r\nseveral years filled the position as cook for the company, took pride in\r\nshowing his skill. The children told how they had made the acquaintance\r\nof the officers during the journey, and this especially interested Mr.\r\nRawlison, whose brother Richard was married to one of Dr. Clary’s\r\nsisters, and had resided in India for several years. As they were\r\nwithout children, the uncle was very fond of his little niece, whom he\r\nonly knew from photographs, and he inquired about her in all his\r\nletters. The two fathers were also much amused at the invitation which\r\nStasch had received from Captain Glen to go to Mombasa. The boy took\r\nthis invitation quite seriously, and made up his mind some day to visit\r\nhis new friend on the other side of the equator. Mr. Tarkowski was\r\nobliged to explain to him that the English officials never stay long on\r\nduty in the same place—owing to the treacherous climate of Africa—and\r\nbefore he, Stasch, would be grown up the captain would be at his tenth\r\npost, or perhaps no longer in this world.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the whole party went outside the tents, where the servants\r\nput up canvas chairs, and prepared siphons of soda-water and brandy for\r\nthe two gentlemen. It was now night and unusually warm, and the full\r\nmoon made it as brilliant as day. The white walls of the ugly buildings\r\nlooked green in contrast to the tents, the stars twinkled in the\r\nfirmament, and the air was filled with the perfume of roses, acacias,\r\nand heliotrope. The town was now asleep. In the silence of the night all\r\nthat could be heard was an occasional loud cry from the cranes, herons,\r\nand flamingoes, the sound of which came in with the breeze from the Nile\r\ntoward Karoon Lake. Suddenly the bark of a dog was heard, which\r\nsurprised Stasch and Nell, for it seemed to come from the tent they had\r\nnot yet visited, in which were kept saddles, tools, and various things\r\nnecessary in traveling.\r\n\r\n“What a large dog that must be,” said Stasch.\r\n\r\nMr. Tarkowski began to laugh. Mr. Rawlison also laughed; then knocking\r\nthe ashes off his cigar, he said:\r\n\r\n“Well, it was no use to lock him up.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the children.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, as you know, will be Christmas, and this dog was to be a\r\nsurprise for Nell from Mr. Tarkowski, but as the surprise has begun to\r\nbark I am obliged to tell you about it to-day.”\r\n\r\nWhen Nell heard this she quickly climbed on Mr. Tarkowski’s knee and put\r\nher arms around his neck; then she jumped on her father’s knee.\r\n\r\n“Papa, dear, how happy I am, how happy!”\r\n\r\nThe embraces and kisses seemed endless; at last Nell stood on her feet,\r\nand looking into Mr. Tarkowski’s eyes, said:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Tarkowski—”\r\n\r\n“Well, Nell, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“Now that I’ve found out he is here, I ought to see him to-day!”\r\n\r\n“I knew,” cried Mr. Rawlison, pretending to be very much excited over\r\nthe matter, “that this little fly would not be content with only hearing\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tarkowski turned to Chadigi’s son and said:\r\n\r\n“Chamis, bring the dog here.”\r\n\r\nThe Sudanese at once disappeared behind the kitchen-tent and soon\r\nstepped forth leading an enormous animal in leash.\r\n\r\nNell drew back.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she cried out, seizing her father’s hand.\r\n\r\nBut Stasch, on the contrary, went into ecstasies.\r\n\r\n“That is a lion, not a dog.”\r\n\r\n“His name is Saba (lion),” answered Mr. Tarkowski. “He belongs to the\r\nbreed of mastiffs, the largest dogs in the world. This one is only two\r\nyears old, but is already enormous. Don’t be afraid, Nell. He is as\r\ngentle as a lamb. Chamis, let him loose!”\r\n\r\nChamis let go the leash and the dog, feeling himself free, began to wag\r\nhis tail, to rub himself up against Mr. Tarkowski, with whom he had\r\nalready made friends, and to bark for joy.\r\n\r\nBy the light of the moon the children admired his large round head with\r\nits hanging lips, his strong paws, his great size, which with the golden\r\nyellow of his whole body gave him the appearance of a lion. In all their\r\nlives they had never seen anything like him.\r\n\r\n“With such a dog one could safely wander through Africa,” cried Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Ask him if he can catch a rhinoceros for us,” said Mr. Tarkowski.\r\n\r\nIt is true Saba could not answer this question, but he wagged his tail\r\nstill harder and rubbed himself up against them so confidingly that Nell\r\nsuddenly lost all fear and began to stroke his head.\r\n\r\n“Saba, dear, good Saba!”\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlison bent down over him, raised his head toward the little\r\ngirl’s face, and said:\r\n\r\n“Saba, look at this little lady. She is your mistress. You must obey and\r\nprotect her—do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Wurgh!” Saba was heard to say in a deep bass, as if he really\r\nunderstood what was wanted of him.\r\n\r\nAnd he did understand even better than one would imagine, for he took\r\nadvantage of his head being nearly on a level with the girl’s face to\r\nlick her little nose and cheeks with his broad tongue as a sign of\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nThat made every one laugh. Nell had to go into the tent to wash her\r\nface. When she returned after a quarter of an hour she saw that Saba had\r\nlaid his paws on Stasch’s shoulders, and that Stasch bent under the\r\nweight. The dog was a head taller than he.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile bedtime had arrived, but the little girl begged to be allowed\r\nto talk for another half-hour to get better acquainted with her new\r\nfriend. And they became friends so soon that it was not long before Mr.\r\nTarkowski placed her on his back, as ladies ride. She was afraid of\r\nfalling off, so he held her, and told Stasch to lead the dog by the\r\ncollar. After she had ridden a short distance Stasch tried to mount this\r\npeculiar saddle-horse, but the latter quickly sat on his hind legs and\r\nStasch unexpectedly found himself on the sand.\r\n\r\nThe children were just about going to bed when from afar off, on the\r\nmoon-lit public square, two white figures appeared, running toward the\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nSaba, who until now had been so gentle, began to bark in a deep and\r\nmenacing manner, so that Mr. Rawlison ordered Chamis to hold him by the\r\ncollar again. Meanwhile the two men, dressed in white burnooses, stopped\r\nbefore the tent.\r\n\r\n“Who is there?” asked Mr. Tarkowski.\r\n\r\n“Camel-drivers,” said one of the newcomers.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you are Idris and Gebhr? What do you wish?”\r\n\r\n“We have come to ask whether you will need us to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“No. To-morrow and the day after are great holidays, during which it is\r\nnot customary for us to make excursions. Come three days from now, early\r\nin the morning.”\r\n\r\n“We thank you, effendi.”\r\n\r\n“And have you good camels?” asked Mr. Rawlison.\r\n\r\n“Bismillah!” answered Idris. “Real saddle-horses with fat humps and\r\ngentle as lambs. Otherwise Cook would not have engaged us.”\r\n\r\n“Do they not jolt considerably?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, you can lay a handful of beans on the backs of any of them, and\r\nnot one will fall off, no matter how fast they gallop.”\r\n\r\n“If he’s exaggerating he at least does it in true Arab style,” said Mr.\r\nTarkowski, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Or in Sudanese style,” added Mr. Rawlison.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Idris and Gebhr still stood there like two white posts and\r\ncarefully surveyed Stasch and Nell. The moonlight illuminated the faces\r\nof the two sand-drivers and made them look as if carved out of bronze.\r\nThe whites of their eyes looked greenish from beneath their turbans.\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” said Mr. Rawlison.\r\n\r\n“May Allah protect you by day and by night, effendi!”\r\n\r\nAt these words they bowed and departed. Saba was evidently not pleased\r\nwith the two Sudanese, and as they left he sent a deep, thunderous growl\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFor some days following they made no excursions. But to compensate for\r\nthis, when the first star appeared on Christmas night Mr. Rawlison’s\r\ntent was illuminated with hundreds of lights burning on the little\r\nChristmas-tree for Nell. The customary fir-tree had been replaced by a\r\nsalpiglossis plant cut out of a garden in Medinet, but nevertheless Nell\r\nfound among its branches a quantity of dainties to eat, and a beautiful\r\ndoll, which her father had bought for her in Cairo. Stasch received from\r\nhis father the much-longed-for English gun, besides cartridges, hunting\r\nparaphernalia, and a riding-saddle.\r\n\r\nNell was beside herself with joy, and Stasch, although imagining that\r\nany one owning a real gun should be correspondingly sedate, could not\r\nkeep away from it, and choosing a moment when everything was quiet\r\naround the tent, he walked about on his hands. He was especially clever\r\nin performing this feat, which he had often practised at school in Port\r\nSaid, and he sometimes did it to entertain Nell, who envied him his\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nChristmas day and the first part of the vacation the children spent\r\ninspecting their presents and training Saba. Their new friend proved to\r\nbe exceedingly intelligent. On the very first day he learned to give his\r\npaw, bring handkerchiefs—which, however, he did not return\r\nwillingly—and he was made to comprehend that it was not the thing for a\r\ngentleman’s dog to lick Nell’s face. Nell held her finger up and taught\r\nhim various things, and by the affirmative wagging of his tail he gave\r\nher to understand that he was listening with due attention and was\r\nprofiting by these good lessons. During the walks in the sandy town\r\nsquare in Medinet, Saba became more famous every hour, but this, like\r\nall fame, had a reverse side, for he drew a great crowd of Arab children\r\nafter him. At first they remained at a distance, but becoming bolder on\r\naccount of the gentleness of the “monster,” they approached, and at last\r\nswarmed around the tent, so that no one could move freely. And as every\r\nArab child sucks a piece of sugar-cane from morning till night, the\r\nchildren are always followed by swarms of flies, which are not only\r\nannoying, but dangerous, for they spread the germs of the Egyptian\r\neye-disease. Therefore the servants tried to drive away the children.\r\nBut Nell not only interfered to protect them, but divided amongst the\r\nyounger ones sweetmeats, which caused them to adore her and at the same\r\ntime naturally increased their numbers.\r\n\r\nThree days later the general excursions began. Sometimes they traveled\r\non the narrow-gage railroads, of which the English had built many in\r\nMedinet-el-Fayoum, sometimes partly on donkeys, and again on camels. It\r\nis true they found that the praise bestowed on these animals by Idris\r\nwas much exaggerated, for not only beans, but people, found it difficult\r\nto stay on their backs. Yet after all there was a tiny grain of truth in\r\nwhat he said. The camels really did belong to the riding species, and as\r\nthey were well fed with maize, they had fat humps, and showed such an\r\ninclination to gallop that they had to be held back.\r\n\r\nThe Sudanese, Idris and Gebhr, notwithstanding the savage glare in their\r\neyes, gained the confidence and approval of the party, especially on\r\naccount of the zest with which they worked and the great attention they\r\npaid to Nell. Gebhr had always a cruel, brutal expression on his face,\r\nbut Idris, who was not slow to notice every one of the party adored this\r\nlittle person as the apple of his eye, declared over and over again that\r\nhe would be more careful of her than of himself. Nevertheless, Mr.\r\nRawlison imagined that Idris wanted to get at his pocket by means of\r\nNell, but as he thought that nobody could help loving his dear little\r\nonly daughter, he was grateful to him and did not spare the bakshish.\r\n\r\nIn the course of five days the party visited the ruins of\r\nCrocodilopolis, which lie near the town. It is there the Egyptians used\r\nto pray to their god, Sobek, who had a human body with a crocodile’s\r\nhead. The next excursion was made to the Hawara pyramid and the ruins of\r\nthe Labyrinth, and the longest excursion, made on camel-back, was to\r\nKaroon Lake. The northern bank of this lake, save for the ruins of some\r\nold Egyptian towns, is a wilderness in which not a vestige of life\r\nremains; but south of the lake stretches a beautiful, fertile region,\r\nthe banks being overgrown with heather and canebrake, in which\r\ninnumerable flocks of pelicans, flamingoes, herons, wild geese, and\r\nducks make their homes. There Stasch found his first opportunity to show\r\nwhat a good aim he could take and what a good shot he was. Whether he\r\nused an ordinary gun or his Renommier rifle, his shots were so true that\r\nafter each one the astonished Idris and the Arab rowers smacked their\r\nlips, and each time a bird fell into the water they cried out,\r\n“Bismillah and Manalieh!”\r\n\r\nThe Arabs declared that there were a great many wolves and hyenas on the\r\nbank opposite the wilderness, and that if the carcass of a sheep were to\r\nbe hidden there they would be almost certain of getting a shot. In\r\nconsequence of what they heard Mr. Tarkowski and Stasch spent two nights\r\nin the wilderness near the ruins of Dimeh. But the Bedouins stole the\r\nfirst sheep as soon as the huntsmen had left, and the second only\r\nattracted a lame jackal, which Stasch brought down. All further hunting\r\nhad to be postponed, for it was now time for the two engineers to begin\r\ntheir journey to inspect the water-works being erected at Bahr-Yoosuf,\r\nin the vicinity of El-Lahun, to the southeast of Medinet. Mr. Rawlison\r\nwas only waiting for the arrival of Mrs. Olivier. But, unfortunately,\r\ninstead of her arrival, they received a letter from the doctor telling\r\nthem that she was again a victim of erysipelas, due to the bite, and\r\nwould be unable to leave Port Said for some time. They were in a\r\npredicament. It was impossible for them to take the children, old Dinah,\r\nthe tents, and all the servants with them, because the engineers would\r\nbe here to-day and there to-morrow, and they might receive an order to\r\ngo as far as the great Ibrahim Canal. Therefore, after some\r\nconsideration Mr. Rawlison decided to leave Nell behind in care of Dinah\r\nand Stasch, and also of the agent of the Italian Consul and the native\r\n“Moodir” or governor. Mr. Rawlison promised Nell, who was very unwilling\r\nto part with her father, that whenever feasible he and Mr. Tarkowski\r\nwould make trips to Medinet when in the vicinity, and that they would\r\ninvite the children to come to them if there should be anything\r\nespecially worth seeing.\r\n\r\n“We are taking Chamis along with us,” he said, “and we will send him to\r\nyou if necessary. Dinah must always accompany Nell; but as Nell does\r\nwhat she likes with her, you, Stasch, must look after both of them.”\r\n\r\n“You can rest assured,” answered Stasch, “that I shall protect Nell as\r\nif she were my own sister. She has Saba, I have the rifle, and now let\r\nany one dare harm her.”\r\n\r\n“That is not the point!” said Mr. Rawlison. “You can not possibly need\r\nSaba and the rifle. Only please see that she does not get too tired, and\r\nalso that she does not take cold. I have asked the Consul to send for a\r\ndoctor from Cairo at once should she become ill. We will send Chamis as\r\noften as possible to bring us news from you. The Moodir will also visit\r\nyou. Besides, I hope we shall not be away very long.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tarkowski also cautioned Stasch well. He told him that Nell did not\r\nneed his protection, for in Medinet, as also in the whole province of\r\nEl-Fayoum, there were no wild people nor wild animals, and that it would\r\nbe ridiculous, and unworthy of a boy in his fourteenth year, to imagine\r\nsuch a thing. And so he had only to be careful and attentive, and not to\r\nundertake any kind of an expedition on his own account, especially on\r\ncamels with Nell, for one ride on them tires any one out. But when Nell\r\nheard this she looked so sad that Mr. Tarkowski had to calm her.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he said, stroking her hair, “you shall ride on camels, but\r\nwith us, or on the way to us, when we send Chamis to fetch you.”\r\n\r\n“And can we not make any excursions by ourselves, not even tiny little\r\nones?” asked the girl.\r\n\r\nAnd with her forefinger she demonstrated exactly the size of the little\r\nexcursions. The fathers at last gave in, on condition that they would be\r\nled on donkeys and not on camels, and that they were not to go out to\r\nthe ruins, where they might easily fall into a hole, but on the roads to\r\nthe neighboring fields and the gardens on the outskirts of the town. The\r\nDragomans and Cooks servants were always to accompany the children.\r\n\r\nThen the two gentlemen left, but they did not go far away—only to\r\nHawaret-el-Makta—so that ten hours later they were able to return to\r\nMedinet for the night. This they did for several successive days, until\r\nthey had inspected the work in the vicinity. Then, as they were obliged\r\nto inspect work in places somewhat farther away, Chamis came riding up\r\nat night, and early in the morning took Stasch and Nell along with him\r\nto the little town where their fathers wanted to show them something of\r\ninterest. The children spent most of the day with their fathers, and\r\ntoward sunset returned to their tents in Medinet. But some days Chamis\r\ndid not come, and then Nell, notwithstanding she had the company of\r\nStasch and Saba, in whom she always discovered new talents, would watch\r\nlovingly for the messenger. In this manner the time passed until the\r\nfeast of the Three Holy Kings, on which day the two engineers returned\r\nto Medinet.\r\n\r\nTwo days later they went away again, after having announced that they\r\nwould now be gone a longer time, and would probably travel as far as\r\nBeni Suef, and from there to El-Fasher, to the canal which stretches\r\nalong the Nile far southward. Therefore the children were greatly\r\nsurprised when Chamis appeared at Medinet on the third day about eleven\r\no’clock. Stasch, who had gone to the pasture to watch the camels, saw\r\nhim first. Chamis talked with Idris and told Stasch that he was there\r\nonly on his and Nell’s account, and that he was coming to the tents to\r\ntell them where their two fathers had ordered them to go. The boy\r\nimmediately ran with this great piece of news to Nell, whom he found\r\nplaying with Saba before the tent.\r\n\r\n“Have you heard the news yet? Chamis is here!” he cried out from afar.\r\n\r\nNell immediately began to hop, holding both feet together, as little\r\ngirls do when skipping.\r\n\r\n“We are going away! We are going away!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we are going away, and quite far away.”\r\n\r\n“And where to?” asked she, brushing aside the hair from her forehead.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Chamis said he would come here directly and tell us.”\r\n\r\n“Then how do you know that we are going far away?”\r\n\r\n“Because I heard Idris say that he and Gebhr would depart at once with\r\nthe camels. That means that we are going by train and that the camels\r\nwill be sent there in advance to where our fathers are, and from there\r\nwe shall make various excursions.”\r\n\r\nNell had hopped about so long that her loose front hair covered not only\r\nher eyes, but her whole face, and her feet rebounded as quickly as\r\nthough made of rubber.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later Chamis came and bowed before them:\r\n\r\n“Khauagé (young man),” said he to Stasch, “we leave in three hours by\r\nthe next train.”\r\n\r\n“For what place?”\r\n\r\n“To El-Gharak el-Sultani, and from there, together with the two\r\ngentlemen, on camels to Wadi Rayan.”\r\n\r\nStasch’s heart beat with joy, but at the same time he was surprised at\r\nChamis’ words. He knew that Wadi Rayan was a large, round, sandy ledge\r\nof rocks which rises in the Libyan Desert to the south and southwest of\r\nMedinet, and that Mr. Tarkowski and Mr. Rawlison had said when they left\r\nthat they were going in a diametrically opposite direction—toward the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\n“What has happened?” asked Stasch. “So my father and Mr. Rawlison are\r\nnot in Beni Suef, but in El-Gharak?”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” answered Chamis.\r\n\r\n“But they have given orders to have their letters sent to El-Fasher.”\r\n\r\n“In this letter the elder effendi tells why they are in El-Gharak.” And\r\nhe searched his clothes a while for the letter, and then called out:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Nabi! (prophet) I have left the letter in the packet with the\r\ncamel-drivers. I will run and get it before Idris and Gebhr depart.”\r\n\r\nHe ran to the camel-drivers, and meanwhile the children and Dinah began\r\nto prepare for the journey. As a longer excursion lay before them, Dinah\r\npacked up some underlinen and warmer clothes for Nell. Stasch also\r\nthought of his things, and took special pains not to forget the rifle\r\nand the cartridges, as he hoped to come across wolves and hyenas on the\r\nsand-dunes of Wadi Rayan.\r\n\r\nChamis did not return until an hour later, so bathed in perspiration and\r\nso out of breath that he could hardly speak a word.\r\n\r\n“I did not reach the camel-drivers in time,” he finally said. “I tried\r\nto overtake them, but without success. But that is of no consequence,\r\nfor we shall find the letter and also the two effendis in El-Gharak. Is\r\nDinah going with us?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it would be better for her to stay behind. Neither of the\r\neffendis has said anything about her.”\r\n\r\n“Still they planned the journey, arranging for Dinah always to accompany\r\nthe little girl, and therefore she will go with us on this trip.”\r\n\r\nChamis bowed, placed his hand on his heart, and said:\r\n\r\n“Sir, let us hurry or else we shall miss the katr (train).”\r\n\r\nThe baggage was ready, and they arrived at the station in time. It was\r\nnot over thirty kilometers from Medinet to Gharak, but the train on the\r\nlittle branch line which connects these towns goes so slowly and stops\r\nso often that if Stasch had been alone he doubtless would have preferred\r\ntraveling by camel to going by train, for he calculated that Idris and\r\nGebhr, who had departed two hours earlier, would reach Gharak before\r\nhim. But this would have been too long a journey for Nell; so her young\r\nprotector, having been cautioned by both fathers, was very careful not\r\nto fatigue the girl. Besides, time passed so rapidly that they hardly\r\nknew that they had arrived at Gharak.\r\n\r\nThe little station, from which Englishmen usually made excursions to\r\nWadi Rayan, was quite deserted. They saw only several veiled women with\r\nbaskets of oranges, two strange Bedouins, camel-drivers, and Idris and\r\nGebhr with seven camels, one of which was laden with luggage. On the\r\nother hand, there was not a trace of Mr. Tarkowski or Mr. Rawlison; but\r\nIdris explained their absence as follows:\r\n\r\n“Both gentlemen have ridden toward the desert to set up the tent they\r\nbrought from Estah, and have instructed us to follow them.”\r\n\r\n“And how can we find them among the mountains?” said Stasch.\r\n\r\n“They have sent guides to meet us.”\r\n\r\nAt these words he pointed to the Bedouins, the elder of whom bowed down\r\nbefore them, rubbed his finger in his one remaining eye, and said:\r\n\r\n“Our camels are not so fat as yours, but they are just as agile. We\r\nshall be there in an hour.”\r\n\r\nStasch felt glad that they could spend the night in the desert, but Nell\r\nwas somewhat disappointed; until now she had certainly expected to meet\r\nher papa in Gharak.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the station-master, a drowsy Egyptian wearing a red\r\nfez, approached, and as he had nothing else to do he began to gaze at\r\nthe European children.\r\n\r\n“These are the children of the Inglesi who rode toward the desert early\r\nthis morning armed with guns,” said Idris, as he lifted Nell into the\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\nStasch gave his gun to Chamis and seated himself beside Nell, for the\r\nsaddle was large and fashioned like a palanquin, except that it had no\r\nroof. Dinah sat down behind Chamis, the others also mounted camels and\r\nfollowed them, and so they all departed.\r\n\r\nHad the station-master looked after them he might have been surprised,\r\nfor the Englishmen of whom Idris had spoken were traveling directly\r\ntoward the ruins in Sudan, whereas the children were going straight\r\ntoward Talei, in an opposite direction. But he had gone into his house,\r\nfor there were no more trains to stop at Gharak that day.\r\n\r\nIt was five o’clock in the afternoon and the weather was remarkably\r\nfine. The sun had passed to the western side of the Nile and was sinking\r\nbelow the desert. The golden and purple hues of the sunset illuminated\r\nthat side of the heavens. The atmosphere was so permeated with the glow\r\nas to be nearly blinding in its brilliancy. The fields assumed a lilac\r\nhue, but the heights, taking on a pure amethyst color, were sharply\r\noutlined against the twilight background. The world lost all semblance\r\nto reality, and the light effects were as weird as those seen in some\r\nplays.\r\n\r\nAs long as they rode over green and plowed land the Bedouin leader led\r\nthe march at a moderate pace, but the moment the camels felt the desert\r\nsand crunch under their feet the whole scene suddenly changed.\r\n\r\n“Allah! Allah!” screamed the savage voices of the Bedouins.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the cracking of whips was heard, and the camels,\r\nchanging from a trot to a gallop, began to race like a whirlwind,\r\nthrowing clouds of the sand and loose gravel into the air with their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n“Allah! Allah!”\r\n\r\nWhen a camel trots he shakes his rider up more than when he gallops—a\r\ngait these animals seldom use—for then he sways more. And so this wild\r\nride amused the children at first. But it is well known that too rapid\r\nswinging causes dizziness, and after a long time, as their pace did not\r\nslacken, little Nell’s head began to swim and everything became\r\nindistinct before her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Stasch, why are we racing so?” she cried, as she turned toward her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“I think they have given the camels a loose rein and now they can not\r\nhold them back,” Stasch replied.\r\n\r\nBut when he saw that the girl’s face was somewhat pale, he called to the\r\nBedouins, who were racing along ahead of them, to go more slowly. But\r\nhis cries only resulted in their screaming “Allah!” again and the\r\nanimals increasing their speed.\r\n\r\nAt first the boy thought that the Bedouins had not heard him, but when\r\nthere was no answer to his repeated demands, and when Gebhr, who was\r\nriding behind them, continued to whip up the camel on which he and Nell\r\nsat, he came to the conclusion that instead of the camels having broken\r\nloose, it was the men who were hurrying them along for some reason of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that perhaps they had gotten on the wrong road, and\r\nwere obliged to run like this to make up for lost time, fearing that the\r\ntwo gentlemen might scold them if they arrived late. But he soon saw\r\nthat this could not be the reason, for Mr. Rawlison was more likely to\r\nbe angry with him for tiring out Nell. So what could this mean? And why\r\ndid they not obey his orders? In his heart the boy began to be very\r\nangry and also very much worried over Nell.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” he cried with all his might, turning to Gebhr.\r\n\r\n“Onskout! (be quiet),” roared the Sudanese in answer. And they raced on.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt night comes on toward six o’clock. The sunset soon died away\r\nand a full, round moon, colored red from the reflection of the sunset,\r\narose and flooded the desert with its mild light. In the silence nothing\r\nwas to be heard save the camels gasping for breath, the quick, hollow\r\nclatter of their hoofs on the sand, and now and then the cracking of the\r\nBedouins’ whips. Nell was so tired that Stasch was obliged to hold her\r\nin the saddle. Every minute she asked if they would not soon arrive at\r\ntheir destination, and only the hope of seeing her father soon again\r\nbuoyed her up. But they both looked around in vain. An hour passed—then\r\nanother. There was neither tent nor campfire to be seen.\r\n\r\nThen Stasch’s hair stood on end with terror—he realized that they had\r\nbeen kidnapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlison and Mr. Tarkowski were really waiting for the children, but\r\nnot in the midst of the sandy heights of Wadi Rayan, for they had no\r\nreason or wish to go there, but in a quite different place, in\r\nEl-Fasher, a town on the canal of that name, where they were inspecting\r\nwork done during the preceding year. The distance between El-Fasher and\r\nMedinet is about forty-five kilometers in a straight line, but as there\r\nis no direct communication, one is obliged to travel by El-Wasta, which\r\nalmost doubles the distance. Mr. Rawlison consulted the time-table and\r\ncalculated as follows:\r\n\r\n“Chamis went away the day before yesterday,” he said to Mr. Tarkowski,\r\n“and in El-Wasta he took the train coming from Cairo, so he must have\r\nbeen in Medinet this morning. The children only need an hour to pack\r\ntheir things. But supposing they left at noon, they would have had to\r\nwait for the night train, which runs along the banks of the Nile, and,\r\nas I have forbidden Nell to travel by night, they probably started early\r\nthis morning, and they will reach here a little after sunset.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Tarkowski. “Chamis must rest a little; it is true,\r\nStasch is hot headed, but in anything that concerns Nell he can be\r\nrelied on. Besides, I sent him a card telling him that they were not to\r\nleave at night.”\r\n\r\n“He is a capable boy and I have full confidence in him,” replied Mr.\r\nRawlison.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, so have I. In spite of his many faults, Stasch is a boy of\r\ngood character and never lies, for he is brave, and only a coward lies.\r\nHe does not lack energy, and later, when his judgment develops, I think\r\nhe will be able to fight his way through the world.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; but just think if you ever acted with deliberation at his\r\nage?”\r\n\r\n“I must confess that I did not!” replied Mr. Tarkowski, laughing; “but\r\nperhaps I was not so self-conscious as he is.”\r\n\r\n“He will get over that. Meanwhile, be glad that you have such a boy.”\r\n\r\n“And you that you have such a sweet, dear little soul as Nell.”\r\n\r\n“God bless her,” answered Mr. Rawlison, much affected.\r\n\r\nThe two friends clasped hands, and then began to examine the plans and\r\ncost of the water-works, and so the time passed quickly until evening.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock, at night-fall, they went to the station, walked up and\r\ndown the platform, and continued talking about the children.\r\n\r\n“Lovely weather, but cool,” Mr. Rawlison said. “I wonder if Nell has\r\ntaken warm enough clothing with her?”\r\n\r\n“Stasch doubtless thought of it, and Dinah, too.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry we did not go to Medinet ourselves, instead of having them\r\nbrought to us.”\r\n\r\n“Remember that I suggested this.”\r\n\r\n“I know, and if it were not that we have to continue farther south I\r\nwould have agreed to it, but I calculated that the journey would take a\r\nconsiderable time, and so we should not have had as long a time with the\r\nchildren. Besides, I will confess that it was Chamis who gave me the\r\nidea of having them brought here. He told me that he wanted to see them\r\nso much, and that he would be greatly pleased if he were sent after\r\nthem. I am not surprised that he has taken a fancy to them.”\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was cut short by the signals announcing the\r\napproaching train. Soon afterward the fiery eye of the locomotive\r\nappeared in the darkness, and at the same time its panting breath and\r\nwhistling could be heard.\r\n\r\nA string of lighted cars passed along the platform, then the train shook\r\nand stopped.\r\n\r\n“I did not see them at any of the windows,” said Mr. Rawlison.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they are sitting farther back in the car and will soon get\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nThe travelers began to leave the train, but they were chiefly Arabs, for\r\nwith the exception of beautiful palms and acacia groves El-Fasher has\r\nnothing worth seeing. The children had not come.\r\n\r\n“Either Chamis did not catch the train at El-Wasta,” said Mr. Tarkowski,\r\nslightly annoyed, “or he may have overslept and so took the night train,\r\nand they may arrive to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“That may be,” answered Mr. Rawlison, much worried, “but perhaps one of\r\nthem is ill.”\r\n\r\n“If this were so Stasch would have wired.”\r\n\r\n“Who knows, perhaps we may find a telegram awaiting us at the hotel.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go and see.”\r\n\r\nBut in the hotel there was no news for them. Mr. Rawlison became even\r\nmore uneasy.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what also might have happened?” said Mr. Tarkowski. “If,\r\nfor instance, Chamis overslept, he would not have told the children; he\r\nwould merely go to them to-day and tell them that they are to travel\r\nto-morrow. He will excuse himself to us by saying that he did not\r\nunderstand our orders. Anyway, I will wire to Stasch.”\r\n\r\n“And I to the moodir of Fayoum.”\r\n\r\nSoon afterward two telegrams were sent off. As yet there was no occasion\r\nto be alarmed, but while awaiting a reply the engineers passed a bad\r\nnight. They were up again early in the morning.\r\n\r\nToward ten o’clock a telegram arrived from the moodir that read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“It has been ascertained at the station that the children left the day\r\nbefore for Gharak el-Sultani.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine that the fathers were greatly surprised and very\r\nangry at this unexpected news. For a while they gazed at each other, as\r\nif they had not understood the words of the telegram; then Mr.\r\nTarkowski, who was a very excitable man, struck the table with his fist\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n“This is Stasch’s work, but I will soon cure him of such ideas.”\r\n\r\n“I should never have thought that of him,” answered Nell’s father. But\r\nafter a while he asked:\r\n\r\n“Well, and Chamis?”\r\n\r\n“Either he has not met them and does not know what to do, or he has gone\r\nin search of them.”\r\n\r\n“That is what I think.”\r\n\r\nAn hour later they left for Medinet. In the tents they learned that the\r\ncamel-drivers had also departed, and at the station it was stated on\r\ngood authority that Chamis had left for El-Gharak with the children.\r\n\r\nThings looked darker and darker, and they could only be explained at\r\nEl-Gharak.\r\n\r\nIt was at this station that the terrible truth began to unveil itself.\r\n\r\nThe station-master, the same sleepy man with the colored spectacles and\r\nthe red fez, told them that he had seen a boy about fourteen years old\r\nand a little girl eight years old with an elderly negress, and that they\r\nhad ridden toward the desert. He was not quite sure whether they had\r\neight or nine camels with them, but he had noticed that one of them was\r\nladen, as if going on a long journey, and that the two Bedouins also\r\ncarried a great deal of baggage on their saddles, and he remembered that\r\nwhen he had looked at the caravan one of the camel-drivers, a Sudanese,\r\ntold him that they were the children of Englishmen who had ridden to\r\nWadi Rayan.\r\n\r\n“Have these Englishmen returned?” asked Mr. Tarkowski.\r\n\r\n“Yes. They returned yesterday with two wolves they had shot,” answered\r\nthe station-master, “and I was very much surprised that they did not\r\nbring the children back with them. But I did not ask them the reason,\r\nfor it was none of my business.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he returned to his work.\r\n\r\nDuring this explanation Mr. Rawlison’s face turned as white as paper.\r\nLooking at his friend with a wild stare, he raised his hat, lifted his\r\nhand to his perspiring forehead, and staggered as if he were about to\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n“Rawlison, be a man!” cried Mr. Tarkowski. “Our children have been\r\nkidnapped. They must be saved!”\r\n\r\n“Nell! Nell!” repeated the unhappy Englishman. “Nell and Stasch! It is\r\nnot Stasch’s fault! They have both been brought here by treachery and\r\nthen carried off. Who knows why? Perhaps in hopes of a ransom. Chamis is\r\ncertainly in the plot, and so are Idris and Gebhr.”\r\n\r\nNow he remembered what Fatima had said, that both these Sudanese were of\r\nthe Dangali tribe, to which the Mahdi belonged, and that Chadigi, the\r\nfather of Chamis, was also of the same tribe. As he thought of this his\r\nheart nearly stopped beating, for now he knew that the children had not\r\nbeen carried off in the hopes of a ransom, but to be exchanged for Smain\r\nand his family.\r\n\r\n“But what would the tribe of the evil-minded prophet do with them? It\r\nwould be impossible for them to hide themselves in the desert or\r\nanywhere along the banks of the Nile, for in the desert they would all\r\ndie of hunger and thirst, and on the bank of the Nile they would be sure\r\nto be discovered. So there was only one course for them to pursue, and\r\nthat was to flee with the children to the Mahdi!”\r\n\r\nThis thought filled Mr. Tarkowski with terror, but this energetic man,\r\nwho had formerly been a soldier, soon composed himself, recalled vividly\r\nto his memory all that had happened, and tried to think of some means of\r\nrescuing the children.\r\n\r\n“Fatima,” he reasoned, “had no cause to revenge herself on our children;\r\nso if they were carried off it was only to give them into Smain’s hands.\r\nThere is no possibility of their being threatened with death, and in\r\nmisfortune that is something; but, on the other hand, the road that lies\r\nbefore them may lead to their destruction.”\r\n\r\nHe told Mr. Rawlison what he thought, then he continued:\r\n\r\n“Idris and Gebhr, savage and ignorant men, think that the hosts of the\r\nMahdi are not far off, but the Mahdi has advanced as far as Khartum,\r\nwhich is about two thousand kilometers from here. This distance they\r\nwould have to travel along the banks of the Nile; they can not leave\r\nthis route, for if they do the camels and the people would die of\r\nthirst. Go immediately to Cairo and ask the Khedive to send telegrams to\r\nevery military station and make a raid on both banks of the river. The\r\nsheiks on the banks must be offered a large reward for the capture of\r\nthe kidnappers. Every one coming to the villages to get water must be\r\nheld up. In this way Idris and Gebhr will surely fall into the hands of\r\nthe law, and we will have our children once more.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlison had regained his composure.\r\n\r\n“I will go,” he said. “These villains have forgotten that England’s army\r\nunder Wolseley is now hastening to the aid of Gordon and will separate\r\nthem from the Mahdi. They shall not escape. They can not escape! I will\r\nsend a telegram to our minister at once and then I shall go. What do you\r\nintend to do?”\r\n\r\n“I shall telegraph for leave of absence, and without waiting for a reply\r\nI shall follow in their footsteps along the Nile to Nubia, to direct the\r\nsearch.”\r\n\r\n“Then we shall meet, for I also intend doing likewise from Cairo on.”\r\n\r\n“All right! And now to work!”\r\n\r\n“With God’s help!” answered Mr. Rawlison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the camels stormed like a hurricane over the sand glistening\r\nin the moonlight. It was night. The moon, at first red and large as a\r\nwheel, paled and rose higher. The distant heights of the desert were\r\ncovered with a muslin-like, silvery mist, which instead of hiding them\r\nfrom view clothed them with a mysterious light. Ever and anon the\r\nplaintive whining of jackals rang out from among the scattered rocks.\r\n\r\nStill another hour passed. Stasch put his arm around Nell to support her\r\nand to lessen the springing swing of this wild ride, which was most\r\nfatiguing to the girl. The girl asked herself over and over again why\r\nthey were racing so and why they did not see their fathers’ tents. At\r\nlast Stasch decided to tell her the truth, which sooner or later must\r\ncome to light.\r\n\r\n“Nell,” he said, “take off one glove and let it drop without attracting\r\nattention.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Stasch?”\r\n\r\nHe pressed her to him and answered with an unusual apprehensiveness in\r\nhis voice:\r\n\r\n“Do as I tell you.”\r\n\r\nNell held on to Stasch with one hand, and as she was afraid to let go,\r\nshe began to draw off the glove with her little teeth, each finger\r\nseparately, and when she had pulled it entirely off, she let it drop to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n“After a little while throw the other down also,” said Stasch a few\r\nminutes later. “I have thrown mine away, but yours can be seen better\r\nbecause they are light.”\r\n\r\nHe noticed that the girl looked questioningly at him, and continued:\r\n\r\n“Nell! Do not be frightened! But, you see—it is possible that we may\r\nnot meet your father or mine, and that these horrid people have carried\r\nus off. But don’t be frightened, for if that is the case, an expedition\r\nwill be sent after us and we shall be overtaken and brought back. That\r\nis why I told you to drop your glove, so that the searchers can trace\r\nus. Meanwhile we can do nothing more, but later I will think of\r\nsomething. I am sure I can think of something, but don’t be afraid, just\r\nhave faith in me.”\r\n\r\nAfter having learned that she would not see her father, and that they\r\nwere fleeing far into the desert, Nell began to tremble from fright and\r\nto cry; at the same time she nestled closer to Stasch, and sobbingly\r\nasked him why they had been carried off and where they were being taken\r\nto. He consoled her as best he could, using almost the same words with\r\nwhich his father had consoled Mr. Rawlison. He said that their fathers\r\nwould follow them and communicate the news to all the garrisons along\r\nthe Nile. He assured her that whatever happened he would never leave her\r\nand that he would always protect her.\r\n\r\nBut her longing for her father and her desire to see him overcame her\r\nfear, and she continued to weep for a long while. Thus they raced\r\nthrough the bright night, over the desert sand, both feeling very sad.\r\nBut Stasch was not only completely discouraged and frightened, but\r\nthoroughly ashamed. It is true he was not to blame for what had\r\nhappened, but, on the other hand, he remembered how he used to brag and\r\nhow his father had often corrected him for it. Before this he had been\r\nthoroughly convinced that there could be no situation too great for him\r\nto meet; he had considered himself an invincible bully, and felt ready\r\nto challenge the whole world. But now he realized that he was a small\r\nboy with whom any one could do as he liked, and that he was galloping\r\nalong on a camel against his will, because a half-savage Sudanese drove\r\nit from behind. This was a great mortification to him, but he saw it was\r\nimpossible to make any resistance. He was obliged to acknowledge to\r\nhimself that he was really afraid of these people and the desert, and\r\nthat he dreaded what might still be in store for him and Nell. But he\r\nfaithfully promised not only her, but himself also, that he would look\r\nafter her and protect her, if need be at the cost of his own life.\r\n\r\nNell, tired out from crying and the wild ride, which had now lasted six\r\nhours, began to doze, and from time to time went fast asleep. Stasch,\r\nwho knew that to fall off a galloping camel means instant death, tied\r\nher fast to him with a rope which he found on the saddle. But after a\r\nwhile it seemed to him that the camels were not galloping so fast,\r\nalthough they were now running over flat, soft sand. In the distance\r\nglowing heights appeared to loom, and on the plains imaginary objects,\r\napt to be seen at night in the desert, came and went in fantastic\r\nfashion. The moon shone paler and paler from the heavens. Before them\r\npeculiar, pinkish, transparent clouds massed themselves at random and\r\nglided away as if blown along by gentle zephyrs. Stasch noticed that the\r\ncamels and the burnooses of the Bedouins in coming into illuminated\r\nplaces suddenly assumed a pinkish hue, and that a delicate pink\r\nenveloped the whole caravan. Sometimes the clouds changed to a bluish\r\nhue. This phenomenon continued until they reached the heights.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at this chain of hills the camels slowed down still more. On\r\nevery side were rocks, which either protruded from the sandy hillocks or\r\nwere strewn about in the wildest confusion. The ground had become stony.\r\nThey passed several depressions strewn with stones and resembling\r\ndried-up beds of rivers. Sometimes they came upon narrow passes, which\r\nthey were obliged to ride around. The animals began to step more\r\ncarefully, lifting up their feet as if dancing, when picking their way\r\nthrough the hard shrubs of Jericho roses, with which the sand-dunes and\r\nrocks were plentifully covered. The camels stumbled frequently, and it\r\nwas evident they needed a rest.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouins then halted in a narrow, abandoned pass, slid out of their\r\nsaddles, and commenced to unload the baggage. Idris and Gebhr followed\r\ntheir example. They began to look after the camels, to loosen their\r\nsaddles, to take down the provisions, and to look for flat stones on\r\nwhich to build a fire. They could find neither wood nor manure, which\r\nthe Arabs burn, but Chamis, Chadigi’s son, picked Jericho roses, heaping\r\nthem up in a large pile, and lighted them. Whilst the Sudanese were busy\r\nwith the camels, Stasch, Nell, and old Dinah, the nurse, found\r\nthemselves together a little apart from the others. But Dinah was more\r\novercome than the children and was unable to say a word. After wrapping\r\nNell up in a warm rug, she sat down on the ground beside her and began\r\nto kiss her hands and to sigh. Stasch immediately asked Chamis what was\r\nthe meaning of all that had taken place, but the latter showed his white\r\nteeth as he laughed and went off to collect more Jericho roses. Then\r\nStasch asked Idris, who answered curtly: “You will see,” and threatened\r\nhim with his finger. When at last the fire from the rose branches, which\r\nat first only flickered, burst into flame, every one sat around it in a\r\ncircle—except Gebhr, who remained with the camels—and they began to\r\neat little cakes of maize and dried lamb and goat’s meat. The children,\r\nravenously hungry after the long journey, ate also, although Nell’s eyes\r\ncontinually closed in sleep; but meanwhile by the pale light of the fire\r\nGebhr’s dark face with its shining eyes appeared, as he held up two\r\nsmall, light-colored gloves and asked:\r\n\r\n“To whom do these belong?”\r\n\r\n“To me!” answered Nell in a sleepy and tired voice.\r\n\r\n“To you, you little viper,” hissed the Sudanese through his clenched\r\nteeth. “Are you marking the way so that your father can trace us?”\r\n\r\nFuriously angry, he beat her with his scourge, a terrible Arabian whip,\r\nwhich will tear open even the skin of a camel. Although Nell was covered\r\nwith a thick rug, she screamed out with fright and pain, but he did not\r\nsucceed in giving her a second blow, for Stasch immediately jumped up\r\nlike a wild-cat, threw his head against Gebhr’s chest, and grasped him\r\nby the throat. So suddenly did this happen that the Sudanese fell on his\r\nback with Stasch on top of him, and they both rolled over and over on\r\nthe ground. The boy was very strong for his age, but Gebhr was soon able\r\nto overcome him. At first he loosened his hands from his throat, then\r\nthrew him face downward on the ground, and pressing down his neck with\r\nhis fist, began to use the scourge on his back.\r\n\r\nThe screams and cries of Nell, who grasped the hands of the savage and\r\nbegged him to let Stasch up, would have been of no avail had not Idris\r\nunexpectedly come to the boy’s rescue. He was older and much stronger\r\nthan Gebhr, and from the beginning of their flight from Gharak\r\nel-Sultani every one obeyed his orders. Now he tore the scourge out of\r\nhis brother’s hand, and throwing it far away, cried:\r\n\r\n“Begone, you fool!”\r\n\r\n“I shall beat this scorpion to death!” answered Gebhr, grinding his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nBut Idris caught hold of him by the chest, and looking him in the eyes\r\nsaid in a threatening undertone:\r\n\r\n“The noble[2] Fatima has forbidden us to hurt these children, for they\r\npleaded for her—”\r\n\r\n“I shall beat him to death!” repeated Gebhr.\r\n\r\n“And I tell you that you shall not lift the scourge against either of\r\nthem again. If you do I will repay you ten times over each lash that you\r\ninflict.”\r\n\r\nThen he tossed and shook him like a palm branch, and continued:\r\n\r\n“These children are Smain’s property, and should one of them not arrive\r\nalive, the Mahdi himself, may God increase his days even more, would\r\nhang you. Do you understand, you fool?”\r\n\r\nThe name of the Mahdi had such an influence on all his believers that\r\nGebhr immediately hung his head, and with great respect and fright\r\ncontinually repeated:\r\n\r\n“Allah akbar! Allah akbar!”\r\n\r\nStasch arose, panting and bruised, but convinced that if his father were\r\nto see and hear him now he would be proud of him, for not only had he\r\nrun to Nell’s assistance without hesitation, but even now, although the\r\nblows from the scourge burned him like fire, he did not think of his own\r\npain, but began to console the girl and to ask her if the lashes had\r\nhurt her.\r\n\r\n“What I got, I got; but he will not touch you again. Oh, if I only had\r\nsome kind of a weapon!”\r\n\r\nThe little girl put both arms around his neck, and moistening his cheeks\r\nwith her tears, she began to assure him that it did not hurt, and that\r\nshe did not cry from pain, but out of sympathy for him. Thereupon Stasch\r\nwhispered close to her ear:\r\n\r\n“Nell, I swear I will not forgive him—not because he beat me, but\r\nbecause he struck you!”\r\n\r\nWith that the conversation came to an end. After a while the brothers\r\nIdris and Gebhr, who had become reconciled, placed coats on the ground\r\nand lay down on them, and soon Chamis followed their example. The\r\nBedouins strewed maize around for the camels. Then they mounted two of\r\nthe animals and rode off in the direction of the Nile.\r\n\r\nNell leaned her little head on Dinah’s knee and fell asleep. The fire\r\nwent out and for a while nothing was heard but the noise of the camels’\r\nteeth crunching the maize. Small clouds appeared in the heavens, and\r\nthough they now and then obscured the moon, the night continued clear.\r\nFrom among the rocks came the ceaseless, pitiful whining of jackals\r\nthroughout the deep hours of the night.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after their departure the Bedouins reappeared with the camels,\r\nwhich were loaded with leather bags filled with water. Relighting the\r\nfire, they sat down on the sand and began to eat. Their arrival awoke\r\nStasch, who had fallen asleep, and also the two Sudanese and Chamis.\r\nThen began the following conversation by the group seated around the\r\nfire, to which Stasch was an eager listener:\r\n\r\n“Can we ride on?” asked Idris.\r\n\r\n“No, for we must rest—we and our camels.”\r\n\r\n“Did any one see you?”\r\n\r\n“No one. We advanced between two hamlets toward the river. We heard\r\nnothing but the barking of dogs in the distance.”\r\n\r\n“We shall always have to ride off for water at midnight, and fetch it\r\nfrom deserted places. When we pass the first cataract (Challal,\r\nSchellal) the villages will be farther apart and the people more devoted\r\nto the Prophet. We will certainly be pursued.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Chamis turned over, and supporting his head on his hands,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“The Mehendisi will wait a whole night in El-Fasher for the children to\r\ncome on the next train, and then they will go to Fayoum, and from there\r\nto Gharak. Not till they reach the latter place can they find out what\r\nhas happened, and then they will have to return to Medinet, to send\r\nwords along a copper wire to the towns on the banks of the Nile—and men\r\non camels will pursue us. All this will take three days at least. We\r\nneed not urge our camels on before then, and so we can smoke our pipes\r\nin comfort.”\r\n\r\nAt these words he took a burning rose twig from the fire and lighted his\r\npipe with it. Then Idris began, after the Arabian custom, to show his\r\nsatisfaction by smacking his lips.\r\n\r\n“Chadigi’s son, you have brought the matter off well,” he said, “but we\r\nmust make use of these three days and nights to advance as far as\r\npossible toward the south. I shall not breathe freely until we have\r\npassed over the desert between the Nile and Chargeh.[3] Pray God that\r\nthe camels do not give out.”\r\n\r\n“They will stand it,” remarked one of the Bedouins.\r\n\r\n“The people also say,” Chamis interposed, “that the Mahdi’s\r\nsoldiers—God lengthen his life—have already got as far as Assuan.”\r\n\r\nStasch, who had not lost a word of this conversation, and had also noted\r\nwhat Idris had told Gebhr before, arose and said:\r\n\r\n“The army of the Mahdi is near Khartum.”\r\n\r\n“La! La! (No! No!)” said Chamis.\r\n\r\n“Do not listen to his words,” answered Stasch, “for he not only has a\r\ndark skin, but a dark brain. If you were to buy fresh camels every three\r\ndays and race as you have done to-day, it would take you a month to\r\nreach Khartum. Perhaps you do not know that not only the Egyptian, but\r\nthe English army also, will hold you up.”\r\n\r\nThese words made somewhat of an impression, and Stasch, aware of it,\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n“Before you are between the Nile and the great oasis all the roads in\r\nthe desert will be guarded by a number of soldiers. Ha! The words on the\r\ncopper wire run quicker than the camels. How will you ever be able to\r\nescape them?”\r\n\r\n“The desert is large,” answered one of the Bedouins.\r\n\r\n“But you have to keep near the Nile.”\r\n\r\n“We can cross to the other side, and while they are looking for us on\r\nthis side we shall be on the other.”\r\n\r\n“The words running over the copper wires will reach the towns and\r\nvillages on both banks of the river.”\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi will send us an angel, who will place his fingers on the eyes\r\nof the English and Turks (Egyptians), and he will cover us over with his\r\nwings.”\r\n\r\n“Idris,” said Stasch, “I am not speaking to Chamis, whose head is as\r\nempty as a gourd bottle, nor to Gebhr, who is an infamous jackal, but to\r\nyou; I know that you want to bring us to the Mahdi and deliver us over\r\nto Smain. But if you are doing it to gain money, then know that this\r\nlittle girl’s father is richer than all the Sudanese together.”\r\n\r\n“And what does that mean?” interrupted Idris.\r\n\r\n“What does it mean? Return of your own free will and the great Mehendisi\r\nwill not be sparing of his money, neither will my father.”\r\n\r\n“Or they will hand us over to the government, and we will be hanged.”\r\n\r\n“No, Idris. You will certainly be hanged if you are caught in your\r\nflight—that is sure to happen. But if you return voluntarily you will\r\nnot be punished; moreover, you will be rich men till the end of your\r\ndays. You know that the white people of Europe always keep their word.\r\nAnd I give you the word of honor of both Mehendisi that it is so, and\r\nthat it will be as I say.”\r\n\r\nStasch was really convinced that his father and Mr. Rawlison would a\r\nthousand times rather keep the promise he made than to let them both,\r\nespecially Nell, take such a terrible journey and lead a still more\r\nterrible life in the midst of the savage and angry tribes of the Mahdi.\r\nSo he waited with beating heart for Idris to answer, but the latter was\r\nwrapt in silence; and after a while he merely said:\r\n\r\n“You say the father of the little girl and yours would give us a great\r\ndeal of money?”\r\n\r\n“That is so.”\r\n\r\n“And would all their money be able to unlock the gates of Paradise for\r\nus, which the blessing of the Mahdi opens?”\r\n\r\n“Bismillah!” hereupon cried the two Bedouins and Gebhr and Chamis.\r\n\r\nStasch now lost all hope, for he knew that though Orientals are very\r\ngreedy for money and are easily corrupted, when a real Mohammedan looks\r\nat anything from a religious point of view no treasures of this world\r\ncan tempt him.\r\n\r\nIdris, encouraged by the assenting cries of his fellows, continued to\r\ntalk, not apparently in answer to Stasch, but for the purpose of gaining\r\ntheir further approval and praise.\r\n\r\n“We are fortunate enough to belong to the same tribe as the holy\r\nprophet, but the noble Fatima and her children are his relatives, and\r\nthe great Mahdi loves them. So when we deliver you and this little girl\r\ninto his hands he will exchange you for Fatima and her children and\r\nbless us. Know that even the water in which he bathes in the morning\r\nwill, according to the Koran, heal the sick and wash away sins. How\r\npowerful must his blessing then be?”\r\n\r\n“Bismillah!” repeated the Sudanese and the Bedouins.\r\n\r\nBut Stasch, grasping the last thread of hope, said: “Then take me along,\r\nbut the Bedouins must return with the little girl. They will deliver\r\nFatima and her children in exchange for me alone.”\r\n\r\n“They are more likely to give them up in exchange for you both.”\r\n\r\nThereupon the boy turned to Chamis:\r\n\r\n“Your father will have to bear the brunt of your deeds.”\r\n\r\n“My father is now in the desert on his way to the prophet,” answered\r\nChamis.\r\n\r\n“Then he will be caught and hanged.”\r\n\r\nBut here Idris thought it better to encourage his comrades.\r\n\r\n“The hawks,” he said, “who are to eat the flesh of our bones are not yet\r\nhatched. We know what threatens, but we are no longer children, and we\r\nhave been familiar with the desert for some time. These people,”\r\npointing to the Bedouins, “have often been in Barbary, and they know the\r\nroads that are traversed only by gazels. There no one will find us and\r\nno one will follow us. We must go to Bahr-Yoosuf and then to the Nile to\r\ndraw water, but we shall do that by night. And besides, do you suppose\r\nthat there are no secret friends of the Mahdi by the river? Let me tell\r\nyou that the further south we go, the surer we are of finding whole\r\ntribes and their sheiks only waiting for an occasion to grasp their\r\nswords in defense of the true faith. These tribes will give the camels\r\nfood and water and set the pursuers on the wrong track. We know that the\r\nMahdi is far away, but we also know that every day brings us nearer to\r\nthe sheepskin on which the holy prophet kneels to pray.”\r\n\r\n“Bismillah!” cried his comrades for the third time.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Idris had greatly risen in their estimation. Stasch\r\nrealized that everything was lost, but thinking that at any rate he\r\ncould protect Nell from the fury of the Sudanese, he said: “After a ride\r\nof six hours the little lady has reached here half dead. How do you\r\nsuppose that she will stand such a long journey? If she dies, I shall\r\ndie, too, and who will you then have to take to the Mahdi?”\r\n\r\nAt first Idris could not answer. Stasch, seeing this, continued:\r\n\r\n“And how will the Mahdi and Smain receive you when they learn that\r\nthrough your stupidity Fatima and her children must forfeit their\r\nlives?”\r\n\r\nBut the Sudanese collected himself and said:\r\n\r\n“I saw how you seized Gebhr by the throat. By Allah, you are a young\r\nlion, and will not die, and she——”\r\n\r\nHere he looked at Nell’s little head leaning up against old Dinah’s\r\nknees, and in a peculiarly soft voice he concluded:\r\n\r\n“We will make a nest, a little bird’s nest, for her on the hump of the\r\ncamel, so that she will not feel the fatigue and can sleep on the way as\r\npeacefully as she is sleeping now.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this he went toward the camels, and with the help of the\r\nBedouins began to prepare a seat for the girl on the back of the best\r\ndromedary. While doing this they talked a great deal, and argued a\r\nlittle; but at last they were able to arrange, with the help of ropes,\r\nrugs, and bamboo rods, something like a deep, immovable basket, in which\r\nNell could either sit or lie down, but from which she could not fall.\r\nOver this seat, which was so spacious that Dinah also found room in it,\r\nthey stretched a canvas roof.\r\n\r\n“Do you see,” said Idris to Stasch, “quails’ eggs would not break in\r\nthese cloth rugs. The old woman will ride with the little lady, so that\r\nshe can wait on her night and day. You will sit with me on another\r\ncamel, but you can ride alongside of her and take care of her.”\r\n\r\nStasch was glad that he had at last gained that much. Thinking over the\r\nsituation, he became convinced that possibly they would be found before\r\nthey reached the first cataract, and this thought gave him courage. But\r\nhe needed sleep, and he attempted to fasten himself to the saddle with\r\nropes, for as it was not necessary to support Nell any longer, he\r\nthought he might get a few hours’ rest.\r\n\r\nThe night was now brighter, and the jackals stopped whining in the\r\nnarrow passes. The caravan was to start directly, but first the\r\nSudanese, on seeing the sunrise, went behind a rock a few steps off, and\r\nthere began their morning ablutions, following out exactly the\r\ninstructions of the Koran, but instead of water, which they wanted to\r\nsave, they used sand. Then they raised their voices, and went through\r\nthe first morning prayer. In the great stillness their words rang out\r\ndistinctly: “In the name of the merciful and pitying God. Glory and\r\nhonor be to the Lord, the ruler of the world, who shows mercy and pity\r\non the day of judgment. We honor Thee, we confess to Thee, we beg help\r\nof Thee. Lead us on in the path of those for whom Thou dost not spare\r\nThy benefits, but not in the ways of evil-doers, who have incurred Thy\r\nanger, and live in sin. Amen.”\r\n\r\nWhen Stasch heard these words he also raised his eyes to heaven—and in\r\nthis distant country, in the midst of the yellow, silent sand of the\r\ndesert plains, he began:\r\n\r\n“We fly to thy patronage, O holy Mother of God, despise not our\r\npetitions in our necessities!”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\nAll the relatives of the Mahdi bore the title “Noble”.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\nA large oasis to the west of the Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nNight faded away. They were just about to mount the camels when they\r\nsuddenly perceived a desert wolf, which, dropping its tail between its\r\nlegs, crossed over the narrow pass that lay about a hundred feet from\r\nthe caravan, and gaining the opposite plateau, ran on, terrified, as if\r\nfleeing before an enemy. In the Egyptian wilderness there are no wild\r\nanimals of which wolves are afraid, and therefore this sight greatly\r\nworried the Sudanese. What could this mean? Could it be that the\r\npursuers were coming upon them? One of the Bedouins quickly climbed a\r\nrock, but hardly had he taken a look than he ran down again.\r\n\r\n“By the prophet,” he cried, distracted and frightened. “There seems to\r\nbe a lion running toward us, and he is already quite near.”\r\n\r\nJust then from behind the rock a “Wurgh” in a deep bass voice was heard,\r\nat which Stasch and Nell with one voice cried out with joy:\r\n\r\n“Saba! Saba!”\r\n\r\nAs this means “lion” in Arabic, the Bedouins were still more frightened.\r\nBut Chamis laughed out loud and said:\r\n\r\n“I know this lion.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he gave a long whistle, whereupon an enormous dog\r\nrushed among the camels. When he saw the children he bounded upon them,\r\nthrew Nell down as she stretched out her hands toward him, climbed up on\r\nStasch, then ran around them, whining and barking. Again he knocked Nell\r\ndown, again climbed up on Stasch, and at last lay down at their feet and\r\nbegan to pant.\r\n\r\nHis flanks were sunken in and froth dripped from his protruding tongue,\r\nbut he wagged his tail and raised his eyes, looking affectionately at\r\nNell, as if to say to her: “Your father told me to protect you, and here\r\nI am!”\r\n\r\nThe children sat down on either side of him and began to caress him. The\r\ntwo Bedouins, who had never seen a similar creature before, looked at\r\nhim with surprise, and repeatedly cried out: “Ouallach! O kelb kebir!”\r\n(Great heavens! What a large dog!). The latter remained quiet for a\r\nwhile, then raised his head in the air and drew in his breath through\r\nhis black nose, which resembled an enormous truffle, sniffed, and sprang\r\nto the dying fire, near which lay remains of food.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the goat and sheep bones began to crack and break\r\nlike straws between his enormous teeth. The remains of a meal for eight\r\npeople, including Dinah and Nell, were enough for even such a “kelb\r\nkebir.”\r\n\r\nBut the Sudanese were worried at the dog’s arrival; the two\r\ncamel-drivers drew Chamis to one side and began to talk to him in a\r\nworried and excited manner:\r\n\r\n“Idris brought this dog here,” cried Gebhr; “but how was he able to find\r\nhis way to the children, for they came to Gharak by train?”\r\n\r\n“Probably he followed the tracks of the camels,” answered Chamis.\r\n\r\n“That is bad. Any one seeing him with us will mark our caravan, and will\r\nbe able to show which road we have taken. By all hazards we must get rid\r\nof him!”\r\n\r\n“But how?” asked Chamis.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a gun—take it and put a bullet in his head.”\r\n\r\n“It is true we have a gun; but I don’t know how to fire it. Perhaps you\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\nChamis might have been able to fire it off in case of necessity, for\r\nStasch had often opened and shut the lock of the gun in his presence;\r\nbut his sympathy was aroused by the dog, which he had grown to like,\r\neven before the arrival of the children in Medinet. Besides, he knew\r\nvery well that the two Sudanese had no idea how to use a gun of the\r\nnewest pattern, and that they would not take the trouble to find out.\r\n\r\n“If you are unable to do it,” he said with a cunning smile, “then no one\r\nbut this little Christian will be able to kill the dog; but this gun\r\nmight go off several times in succession, and so I do not advise you to\r\ngive it into his hands.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven forbid!” answered Idris. “He would shoot us down like quail.”\r\n\r\n“We have knives,” remarked Gebhr.\r\n\r\n“Try them, but remember that you also have a throat, which the dog may\r\ntear open before you have time to stab him.”\r\n\r\n“Then what are we to do?”\r\n\r\nChamis raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Why do you want to kill the dog? Even if you bury him in the sand the\r\nhyenas will dig him out, and the pursuers will find his bones and know\r\nthat we have not gone along the Nile, but have crossed over to this\r\nside. So let him follow us. Whenever the Bedouins go for water, and we\r\nare hidden in a ravine, you may be sure that the dog will stay with the\r\nchildren. Allah!”\r\n\r\n“It is well he caught up to us here; otherwise he would have led the\r\npursuers on our tracks as far as Barbary. You will not need to feed him,\r\nfor if he is not satisfied with the remnants of our meals he will not go\r\nhungry; he can always catch a hyena or a jackal. Let him alone, I tell\r\nyou, and waste no more time chattering.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right,” said Idris.\r\n\r\n“If I am right, I will give him water, so that he will not run to the\r\nNile and be seen in the villages.”\r\n\r\nThus was Saba’s fate decided, and after having rested a little and had a\r\ngood meal he lapped up a dish of water, and thus refreshed, followed the\r\ncaravan with renewed energy.\r\n\r\nThey now rode over a tableland, on which the wind had made furrows of\r\nsand, and from which reached wide stretches of desert. The sky assumed\r\nthe hue of a pearl mussel-shell. Light clouds gathered in the east,\r\nshining like opals, and then melting into golden tints.\r\n\r\nFirst one, then a second ray of light shot forth, and the sun—as is\r\nusual in southern countries, in which there is scarcely any twilight or\r\ndawn—did not rise, but burst forth from behind the clouds like a pillar\r\nof fire, flooding the horizon with living light. Heaven and earth were\r\ncalm, and far as human eyes could see lay the trackless sand plains, now\r\nsuddenly disclosed in the vivid glow.\r\n\r\n“We must hurry,” said Idris, “for we can be seen here from a great\r\ndistance.”\r\n\r\nThe camels, strengthened by their rest, and having had plenty to drink,\r\nraced along with the fleetness of gazels. Saba remained behind, but\r\nthere was no fear that he would get lost and not be forthcoming at the\r\nnext feeding-place. The dromedary on which Idris rode with Stasch ran\r\nalongside of Nell’s camel, so that the children could easily speak to\r\neach other. The seat which the Sudanese had padded proved to be very\r\ncomfortable, and the girl really looked like a little bird in a nest;\r\neven if asleep she could not fall out. This ride fatigued her less than\r\nthe one during the night, and the bright daylight gave her and Stasch\r\ncourage. The lad’s heart was full of hope; as Saba had overtaken them,\r\nmight not the rescuers also be able to do so? He immediately mentioned\r\nthis to Nell, who now smiled at him for the first time since they had\r\nbeen carried off.\r\n\r\n“And when will they overtake us?” she asked in French, so that Idris\r\nwould not understand.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Maybe to-day, maybe to-morrow, maybe in two or three\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\n“But on the return journey we shall not ride on camels?”\r\n\r\n“No. Only as far as the Nile, and then on the Nile to El-Wasta.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s good, that’s good!”\r\n\r\nPoor Nell, who used to be so fond of riding on camels, was now evidently\r\nsick and tired out.\r\n\r\n“On the Nile—to El-Wasta and to papa!” she began to repeat in a sleepy\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nAs she had not rested long at their last stopping-place, she now fell\r\nasleep, the heavy sleep that comes in the morning after great fatigue.\r\nMeanwhile the Bedouins drove the camels ceaselessly on without letting\r\nthem stop for an instant. Stasch noticed that they were going toward the\r\ninterior of the desert.\r\n\r\nTo make Idris less confident that the party would be able to elude the\r\npursuers, and also to show him that he felt certain of their being\r\nfound, Stasch said:\r\n\r\n“You are leaving the Nile and the Bahr Yoosuf, but that will be useless,\r\nfor they will not search for you on the banks, where there is one string\r\nof villages, but in the interior.”\r\n\r\nAnd Idris said:\r\n\r\n“How do you know we are leaving the Nile? The banks can not possibly be\r\nseen from here.”\r\n\r\n“Because the sun, which is now in the east, warms our backs; that means\r\nthat we have turned off toward the west.”\r\n\r\n“You are a clever boy,” said Idris approvingly.\r\n\r\nAnd after a while he added:\r\n\r\n“But the pursuers will not overtake us—neither will you escape from\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered. “I shall not run away, unless it is with her.” And he\r\npointed to the sleeping Nell.\r\n\r\nThey raced along until noon, scarcely making a halt. When the sun stood\r\nhigh in the heavens and it began to be very warm, the camels, although\r\nit is not their nature to perspire profusely, were dripping with\r\nperspiration, and went along much more slowly. Once more the caravan was\r\nsurrounded by rocks and sand heaps. Ravines, which served as beds of\r\nrivers called “Khori” during the rainy season, were seen oftener than\r\nbefore. At last the Bedouins made a halt in one quite hidden between the\r\nrocks. But scarcely had they alighted from the camels than they began to\r\nyell and run forward, bending down and throwing stones. Stasch, who had\r\nnot yet dismounted, saw a strange sight. From between the dried shrubs\r\nthat grow plentifully at the bottom of the “Khors” appeared a large\r\nsnake, which wound its way through the clefts of the rocks as quick as\r\nlightning and glided off to a hiding-place of its own. The angry\r\nBedouins followed it, and Gebhr hurried to their assistance with a\r\nknife. But the unevenness of the ground made it as difficult to strike\r\nthe snake with a stone as to stab it with the knife, and in a little\r\nwhile all three returned with terror on their faces, and the usual cries\r\nof the Arabs were heard.\r\n\r\n“Allah!”\r\n\r\n“Bismillah!”\r\n\r\n“Maschallah!”\r\n\r\nThen the two Sudanese looked at Stasch with a penetrating and\r\nquestioning glance. But he had not the least idea why they did so.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Nell had dismounted, and though she was not so tired as the\r\nnight before, Stasch spread a cloth rug over a shady, level spot and\r\ntold her to lie down, so that, as he said, she could stretch out her\r\nfeet. The Arabs walked about eating their mid-day meal, which consisted\r\nonly of zwiebach, dates, and a drop of water. The camels were not given\r\na drink, as they had been watered during the night. The faces of Idris,\r\nGebhr, and the Bedouins bore an anxious look, and the time of rest\r\npassed in silence. At last Idris took Stasch to one side and began to\r\nquestion him in a mysterious and troubled manner:\r\n\r\n“Did you see that snake?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Was it you who bid it appear before us?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Some misfortune will surely come upon us, for these clumsy fellows were\r\nnot able to kill the snake.”\r\n\r\n“The gallows await you.”\r\n\r\n“Silence! Perhaps your father is a sorcerer?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Stasch without hesitation, immediately realizing that\r\nthese savage and superstitious beings regard the appearance of a snake\r\nas a bad omen—an augury that the flight would not be successful.\r\n\r\n“So your father sent it to us,” continued Idris. “He ought to realize\r\nthat we might take revenge on you for his witchcraft.”\r\n\r\n“You will do nothing to me, for Fatima’s sons would pay you back for\r\nevery wrong done to us.”\r\n\r\n“Did you understand? Remember that if it had not been for me, not only\r\nyou, but the little girl, too, would have bled to death under Gebhr’s\r\nscourge.”\r\n\r\n“I shall intercede only for you. Gebhr will be hanged.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Idris looked at him for a while in surprise and said:\r\n\r\n“Our lives are not in your hands yet; you talk to us as if you were our\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\nAfter a pause he added:\r\n\r\n“You are a peculiar boy; I have never seen any one like you before. I\r\nhave always thought well of you until now—but take care, do not make\r\nany threats.”\r\n\r\n“God punishes traitors!” answered Stasch.\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that the tone of authority with which the boy\r\nspoke, together with the bad omen in the form of the serpent which had\r\nescaped, made Idris feel exceedingly uneasy. Even later, when mounting\r\nhis camel, he frequently repeated: “Yes, I have more than once been kind\r\nto you!” as if he wished at all events to impress this on Stasch’s mind;\r\nthen he began to finger the nut-shell beads of his rosary and to pray.\r\n\r\nToward two o’clock in the afternoon the heat—although it was\r\nwinter—became unbearable. Not a cloud could be seen in the sky, but the\r\nedges of the horizon had become gray. Over the caravan soared several\r\nhawks, which from their great height cast black shadows on the yellow\r\nsand. In the heated air there was a smell as of something burning.\r\nAlthough the camels did not change their pace, they began to sniff. One\r\nof the Bedouins now approached Idris.\r\n\r\n“There is something bad coming,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What do you think it can be?” asked the Sudanese.\r\n\r\n“Evil spirits have awakened the wind, which sleeps in the western part\r\nof the desert, and it has risen out of the sand, and is now rushing\r\ntoward us.”\r\n\r\nIdris rose in his saddle, looked out into the distance, and replied:\r\n\r\n“That’s right. It is coming from the west and south, but it does not\r\nseem to be as furious as the Khamsin.”[4]\r\n\r\n“But only three years ago it buried a whole caravan in the vicinity of\r\nAbu Hammed, and did not uncover it until last winter. Ulla! It may blow\r\nwith such force as to stop up the camels’ nostrils, and dry up the water\r\nin the leather bags.”\r\n\r\n“We must hasten on, and steer our course so that we will strike only the\r\nedge of it.”\r\n\r\n“We are running straight into it, and can not possibly avoid it.”\r\n\r\n“The sooner it comes, the sooner it will be over.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time Idris whipped up his camel with the scourge, and the\r\nothers followed his example. For a while nothing was heard but the cries\r\nof “Yalla! Yalla!” and the hollow sound of the thick whips, that\r\nresembled the loud clapping of hands. The western horizon, which had\r\nbeen almost white, had now become dark. The heat continued, and the sun\r\nblazed down on the heads of the riders. The hawks must have soared very\r\nhigh, for their shadows became smaller and smaller, and at last entirely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIt now became oppressively sultry. The Arabs cried out to the camels\r\nuntil their throats were dry; then they became quiet, and a deathlike\r\nsilence ensued, broken only by the groaning of the animals and the\r\nrustle of two small sand-foxes[5] with enormous ears, which sped past\r\nthe caravan, fleeing to the opposite side of the desert.\r\n\r\nThe same Bedouin who had previously spoken to Idris said once more in a\r\npeculiarly strange tone of voice:\r\n\r\n“The wind will soon break loose and bury everything.”\r\n\r\n“All the more need of helping the little girl.”\r\n\r\nIdris whipped up the camel, and for a while they continued in silence.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you speak?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Because I am wondering whether I had better tie you to the saddle or\r\nbind your hands behind your back.”\r\n\r\n“Have you gone crazy?”\r\n\r\n“No. But I can guess what you want to do.”\r\n\r\n“The searchers will overtake us in any case, so I need not do anything.”\r\n\r\n“The desert is in God’s hands.”\r\n\r\nThey again relapsed into silence. The coarse sand had ceased falling,\r\nbut a fine red dust, somewhat resembling mildew, remained in the air,\r\nthrough which the sun shone like a sheet of copper. Distant objects\r\ncould now be plainly seen. Before the caravan extended a plain, on the\r\nedge of which the Arab’s sharp eyes again perceived a cloud. It was\r\nhigher than the previous ones and rose in columns that formed enormous\r\nfunnels with wide-spreading tops. At this sight the hearts of the Arabs\r\nand Bedouins quaked with fear, for they recognized the sand-spout. Idris\r\nraised his hands, and lifting them to his ears, began to bow to the\r\nadvancing whirlwind. His belief in his own God apparently did not\r\nprevent him fearing others, for Stasch distinctly heard him say:\r\n\r\n“Lord! We are your children, therefore do not devour us!” And the “Lord”\r\nrushed upon them, and hit the camels with such force that they almost\r\nfell to the ground. The animals huddled together in a compact mass, with\r\ntheir heads turned toward the center. Enormous quantities of sand began\r\nto fly. The caravan was enveloped in darkness that momentarily grew more\r\nintense, in which they saw black and indistinct objects—like enormous\r\nbirds or camels—sweep rapidly past them, as if frightened by the\r\nhurricane. The Arabs were greatly alarmed, for they thought they saw the\r\nsouls of the men and animals that had perished in the sand. In the midst\r\nof the tumult and howling of the hurricane they heard strange voices,\r\nsometimes weeping, sometimes laughing, sometimes cries for help. These\r\nsounds were only delusions. Danger a hundred times more terrible\r\nthreatened the caravan. The Sudanese well knew that if one of the great\r\nsand-spouts, which continually form in the center of the hurricane,\r\nshould drag them into its vortex, it would knock down the riders and\r\ndisperse the camels, and, bursting upon them, would in the twinkling of\r\nan eyelash bury them under mountains of sand, there to remain until some\r\nsimilar storm should uncover their bones and scatter them over the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nStasch nearly lost his breath; the sand blinded him, and he became dazed\r\nand dizzy. Sometimes it seemed as though he heard Nell crying and\r\ncalling, and so he thought of her alone. Knowing that the camels were\r\nstanding closely together, and that Idris could not be paying any\r\nattention to him, he determined to steal over to the girl’s camel, not\r\nthat he wished to escape, but only to help and encourage her. He had\r\nscarcely put out his hands to catch Nell’s saddle than Idris’ large arm\r\nheld him back. The Sudanese picked him up like a feather, laid him down,\r\nand tried to bind him with a palm rope, and after he had tied his hands,\r\nplaced him across the saddle. Stasch clenched his teeth and resisted as\r\nmuch as possible, but all in vain. As his throat was parched and his\r\nmouth full of sand, he could not convince Idris that he only wanted to\r\nassist the girl, and had no intention of trying to escape. But a little\r\nlater, feeling that he was all but suffocated, he cried out in a\r\nstrained voice:\r\n\r\n“Save the little Biut! Save the little Biut!”[6]\r\n\r\nThe Arabs preferred to think of saving their own lives. So terrible was\r\nthe sand-storm that the Bedouins could neither sit on the camels, nor\r\ncould the camels remain standing. Chamis and Gebhr sprang to earth to\r\nhold the curb-bits, which were fastened under the lower jaws of the\r\nanimals. Idris pushed Stasch off the back of the saddle and endeavored\r\nto control his camel. The animals stood with their legs far apart so as\r\nto resist the raging storm, but strength failed them, and the caravan\r\nwas blown about in the sand, which pricked like pins, and torn to pieces\r\nas though with lashes from sand-thongs. Slowly at first, then faster,\r\nthey began to twist and stagger as the hurricane advanced. From time to\r\ntime the sand whirls dug grave-like hollows beneath their feet, or the\r\nsand and gravel, rebounding from the flanks of the animals, instantly\r\nformed hillocks, which reached up higher than their knees. In this\r\nmanner hour after hour passed, the situation becoming more and more\r\nalarming. Idris at last realized that the only means of deliverance lay\r\nin remounting the camels and racing with the storm. But that meant\r\nreturning in the direction of Fayoum, where Egyptian courts and the\r\ngallows awaited them.\r\n\r\n“Ha! There is nothing else to be done,” thought Idris. “The hurricane\r\nhas delayed our pursuers also, and as soon as it ceases we will gallop\r\nonce more toward the south.”\r\n\r\nSo he cried out for them to remount. But just then something happened\r\nthat completely changed the situation. The dark sand-clouds, now almost\r\njet black, were suddenly permeated with bluish light. Then the darkness\r\ngrew still more intense, and now arose in the higher regions of the air\r\nthe slumbering thunder. Awakened by the whirlwind, it began to roll\r\nloudly, threateningly, and angrily between the Arabian and Libyan\r\ndeserts. It seemed as if mountains were falling from the sky. The\r\ndeafening noise increased; it made the earth tremble, and began to\r\nencircle the entire horizon.[7] From time to time the sound crashed with\r\nsuch terrible force that it seemed as though the firmament was broken\r\nand falling to earth. Sometimes it was like a hollow, distant rumbling;\r\nthen again it broke forth still louder, flashed its blinding lightning,\r\nthrew thunderbolts, rose and fell and crashed again. This continued a\r\nlong while.\r\n\r\nAt last the wind ceased, as if terrified, and after a long, momentous\r\npause the doors of heaven closed and a stillness as of death ensued.\r\n\r\nA little later the voice of the leader rang through the silence:\r\n\r\n“God is over the storm and hurricane! We are saved!”\r\n\r\nThey started off again; but the darkness was so impenetrable that\r\nalthough the camels ran side by side, their riders could not see each\r\nother, being obliged to call out every minute so as not to become\r\nseparated. From time to time the lightning pierced the sand-filled air\r\nwith vivid blue and red flashes, and then the darkness became so intense\r\nthat it might almost be felt. Despite the confidence that the leader\r\ninspired in the Sudanese, they still felt uneasy, for they ran on\r\nblindly, not knowing where they were going, whether turning round in a\r\ncircle or going toward the north or south. The animals stumbled every\r\nminute and made but little speed, panting so peculiarly and breathing so\r\nhard that it seemed to their riders as if the whole desert was gasping\r\nfrom fright. At last came the first large raindrops that generally\r\nfollow a hurricane, and the leader shouted through the darkness:\r\n\r\n“Khor!”\r\n\r\nThey had reached a ravine. At first the camels stood motionless at the\r\nedge, then began to descend very carefully.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\nThis is a southwest wind that blows only in the spring-time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\nAn animal called “feuschak,” smaller than a fox.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\nThe Little Girl.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\nThe author heard a peal of thunder near Aden, which continued\r\nincessantly for nearly half an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe ravine was broad and covered with stones, between which grew stunted\r\nthornbushes. Broken rocks formed its southern side. The Arabs observed\r\nthese details in the lightning flashes, which were now less vivid but\r\nmore frequent. They soon discovered a flat cave, or, speaking more\r\nexactly, a spacious niche, in the side of the rock, in which they could\r\neasily take refuge. The camels could also find a sheltered place on a\r\nslight elevation near by. The Bedouins and the Sudanese relieved the\r\nanimals of their burdens and saddles, and Chamis, the son of Chadigi,\r\nwent about collecting thorn branches for the fire. Large raindrops fell\r\nintermittently, but the shower did not really begin until every one had\r\nlain down to sleep. At first the rain resembled threads, then ropes, and\r\nat last it seemed as if overflowing streams from invisible clouds were\r\ndeluging the earth. But such showers, which occur only once in many\r\nyears, even in winter cause the canals and the Nile to overflow, and in\r\nAden they fill the enormous cisterns which are the mainstay of the town.\r\nStasch had never seen anything like this before. A rushing stream filled\r\nthe bed of the “Khors” and curtains of water covered the entrance of the\r\ncave. Nothing could be heard except the rushing of the water and the\r\npattering of the rain. The camels stood on the height, and so the storm\r\nat the most could but give them a bath; but the Arabs looked out every\r\nminute to see that the animals were not in any danger. On the other\r\nhand, the party found it very pleasant in the protecting niche to sit\r\naround the bright fire of brushwood, which was not wet by the rain. Joy\r\nwas written on all their faces. Idris, who had unbound Stasch’s hands on\r\ntheir arrival, so that he could eat, now turned to him and said with a\r\nscornful smile:\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi is greater than all the white sorcerers. He stopped the\r\nsand-storm and sent the rain.”\r\n\r\nStasch did not answer, for he was busy looking after Nell, who scarcely\r\nseemed to breathe. At first he took the sand out of her hair, and\r\nordered old Dinah to unpack the things they had taken with them to go to\r\ntheir fathers; then he took a towel, moistened it with water, and\r\ncarefully washed the child’s face. Dinah could not do this, for she had\r\ngone nearly stone blind during the hurricane, and the washing of her\r\nheated eyelids at first brought no relief. Nell seemed indifferent to\r\nall Stasch’s efforts, and only looked at him like a tired little bird,\r\nbut when he drew off her shoes to shake out the sand, and then spread\r\nout the cloth rug for her to lie upon, she put her little arms around\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\nIn his heart he felt more and more sympathy for her; he now felt that he\r\nwas her guardian, elder brother, and sole protector. He was also aware\r\nthat he was very fond of this little sister, a great deal more fond of\r\nher than he ever had been. He had liked her when at Port Said, but he\r\nlooked upon her as a “little baby,” and so, for instance, it never\r\noccurred to him then to kiss her hand when saying good-night. If any one\r\nhad ever mentioned such a thing to him he would have thought that a\r\nthirteen-year-old gentleman could not do such a thing without affecting\r\nhis dignity and his years. But now the general misfortune had awakened\r\nhis slumbering affection for her, and he not only kissed one, but both\r\nof the girl’s hands.\r\n\r\nHe lay down, still thinking of her. He decided to do something\r\nextraordinary to deliver her from captivity. He was prepared for\r\neverything—for wounds or for death—but with a slight reservation in\r\nhis heart that the wounds would not hurt too much and that the death\r\nmight not be a real one; for in the latter case he would not be able to\r\nsee Nell’s joy over her freedom. Then he began to think over the most\r\nheroic means of delivering her, but his thoughts became confused. For a\r\nwhile it seemed to him as if whole sand-clouds were burying them and\r\nthen as if all the camels were trying to creep into his head—and then\r\nhe fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAfter the Arabs had attended to the camels, they sank down, dead tired\r\nfrom the fight with the whirlwind, and slept like logs. The fires went\r\nout, and it was pitch dark in the cave. Soon the sleepers began to\r\nsnore, and outside was heard the pattering of the rain and the rushing\r\nof the water as it broke against the stones on the bed of the ravine.\r\nAnd so the night passed.\r\n\r\nBefore morning Stasch was so cold that he awakened from his sound sleep.\r\nIt seems that the water, which had collected above them in the crevices\r\nof the rock, began to trickle drop by drop through a crack in the hollow\r\nof the cave. The boy sat up on the cloth rug, so sleepy at first that he\r\ncould not tell where he was and what was happening to him. But he was\r\nsoon wide awake.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he thought. “Yesterday there was a hurricane and we were carried\r\noff by it, and this is the cave where we took refuge from the rain.”\r\n\r\nHe began to look around. At first he was surprised to see that the rain\r\nhad ceased, and that it was no longer dark in the cave, for the moon,\r\nwhich was now low down near the horizon, about to set, illumined it. The\r\nentire interior of the broad but shallow niche could be plainly seen.\r\nStasch distinctly noted the Arabs lying together, and close to the\r\nlargest wall of the cave he saw the white dress of Nell, who was\r\nsleeping next to Dinah.\r\n\r\nHe felt exceedingly anxious about her.\r\n\r\n“Sleep, Nell, sleep!” he said to himself. “But I can not sleep—I must,\r\nI must save her!”\r\n\r\nThen, looking at the Arabs, he added: “Ah, I would like to——”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he trembled, for his eye lighted upon the leather case\r\ncontaining the gun he had received at Christmas, and alongside of it the\r\ncartridges lay, so near—between him and Chamis—that he had but to\r\nstretch forth his hand to reach them.\r\n\r\nHis heart began to beat and to thump like a hammer. If he could but\r\ncatch hold of the gun and the cartridges he would doubtless have command\r\nof the situation. In this case he would only have to creep quietly out\r\nof the niche, secrete himself a short distance away, between the rocks,\r\nand guard the entrance from that position. “When the Sudanese and the\r\nBedouins awake,” thought he, “they will notice that I have escaped, and\r\nall will rush out of the cave at once; then with two bullets I can shoot\r\ndown the first two, and before the others reach me the gun will be\r\nreloaded. Chamis will be the only one left, but I will make short work\r\nof him.”\r\n\r\nThen he imagined the four dead bodies bathed in blood, and his heart was\r\nfilled with horror and fright. To murder four people! It is true they\r\nare villains, but just the same, it is terrible! He remembered that in\r\nPort Said he had seen a fellah, a workman, who had been killed by the\r\nhandle of a shaft-sinking machine, and what a terrible impression the\r\nquivering remains amid a pool of blood had made upon him. The very\r\nthought of it caused him to shudder. And now he was about to kill four!\r\nSin, horror! No! no! He could not do it!\r\n\r\nHe began to struggle with his thoughts. For himself he would not think\r\nof doing it—certainly not! But now it was a case of Nell, of her\r\ndefense, her safety, and her life, for she certainly could not stand all\r\nthese hardships and would surely die, either during the journey or in\r\nthe midst of the wild, beastly tribes of Dervishes. What was the blood\r\nof such wretches in comparison with Nell’s life, and was it right to\r\nhesitate in such a case? For Nell! For Nell!\r\n\r\nThen a thought flew like a flash of lightning through his head and made\r\nhis hair stand on end. What would happen if one of these villains should\r\npoint a knife at Nell’s breast and threaten to kill her if he, Stasch,\r\nwould not surrender and give up the gun? What would happen then?\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said the boy to himself, “I should give myself up at\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\nAnd at the thought of his helplessness he again threw himself down\r\ndespairingly on the cloth rug.\r\n\r\nThe rays of moonlight now entered the opening of the cave at such an\r\nangle that it became dark inside. The Arabs still snored. Stasch lay\r\nquiet for a while, then a new thought dawned upon him.\r\n\r\nSuppose he should creep out of the cave with the gun, hide himself\r\nbetween the rocks, and not kill the men, but only shoot down the camels?\r\nIt is true it would be a shame to sacrifice the innocent animals, but\r\nwhat was to be done? People kill animals not only to save lives, but\r\nalso for their meat. Now one thing was certain, that if he were to\r\nsucceed in shooting down four or five camels, it would be impossible to\r\ncontinue the journey. Not one of the caravan would dare visit the\r\nvillages on the river-banks to buy new camels. So Stasch would promise,\r\nin the names of their fathers, that the men should not be punished, but\r\nbe rewarded, and the only thing left for them to do would be to return.\r\n\r\nThat was all very well, but supposing they did not give him time to make\r\nthese promises, but murdered him in the first onset of their wrath?\r\n\r\nHowever, they would have to give him time and listen to him, for with a\r\ngun in his hand he would be able to keep them at a safe distance until\r\nhe had said all he wanted to. They would realize that the only way to\r\nsave themselves would be to surrender. Then he would put himself at the\r\nhead of the caravan and lead it straight to the Bahr Yoosuf and to the\r\nNile. They were still quite a distance from there—some one or two days’\r\njourney—for the Arabs had taken the precaution to travel quite far into\r\nthe interior. But that was no matter; there would be several camels\r\nleft, and on one of these Nell could ride. Stasch began to examine the\r\nArabs carefully. They were all sleeping the sound sleep of utter\r\nexhaustion; but as the night would soon be over, they might awaken at\r\nany moment. Immediate action was necessary. It would not be difficult to\r\ntake the cartridge case, for it lay by his side; but it would not be so\r\neasy to get the gun, which Chamis had placed farther away, on the other\r\nside. Stasch hoped that he would be able to take it away, but he decided\r\nnot to remove it from its case or adjust the gun barrel until he should\r\nget some distance from the cave, for he feared the click of the steel\r\nmight awaken the sleepers.\r\n\r\nThe moment had come. The boy crept over Chamis like a worm, and grasping\r\nthe box by the handle, picked it up and slowly drew it over to his side.\r\nThough he clenched his teeth and tried to overcome his emotions, his\r\nheart and pulse beat quickly, everything grew dark before his eyes, and\r\nhis breath came and went in rapid gasps, and when the straps which\r\nclosed the box creaked a little, cold drops of sweat stood in beads on\r\nhis forehead. This single second seemed to him as long as a century. But\r\nChamis never moved. The box was lifted over him and placed beside the\r\ncartridge case.\r\n\r\nStasch breathed again. Half the work was done. Now it was necessary to\r\ncreep quietly out of the cave, run a short distance, hide himself in the\r\nrocks, open the case, adjust the gun, load it, and put a number of\r\ncartridges in his pocket. Then the caravan would be at his mercy.\r\n\r\nStasch’s black silhouette stood out against the light background of the\r\nentrance to the cave. Another second and he would be outside. Another\r\nminute and he would hide himself in the rocks. And then, even if one of\r\nthe robbers should awaken, before he realized what had happened, and\r\nbefore he could awaken the others, it would be too late. Fearing that he\r\nmight knock down one of the many stones which lay at the entrance of the\r\nniche, the boy took one step forward and groped with the sole of his\r\nfoot for firm ground.\r\n\r\nHe thrust his head out of the opening, and was just about to step out,\r\nwhen something unexpectedly happened which made the blood freeze in his\r\nveins. For through the dead silence Saba’s joyful bark rang forth like\r\nthunder, filled the whole ravine, and awakened its sleeping echoes. The\r\nArabs sprang up as one man out of their sleep, and the first thing that\r\nmet their eyes was Stasch with the case in one hand and the cartridges\r\nin the other.\r\n\r\nAh, Saba, what have you done!\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThey at once set up a howl and fell on Stasch, tearing the gun and\r\ncartridges from his grasp; they threw him on the ground, bound his hands\r\nand feet with ropes, beat him, and stamped on him with their feet until\r\nIdris, fearing the boy would be killed, drove them away. Then they began\r\nto speak in broken sentences, as people do who have had some great\r\ndanger hovering over them, from which they have only escaped by chance.\r\n\r\n“That boy is Satan personified!” cried Idris, his face pale with fright\r\nand excitement.\r\n\r\n“He would have shot us down as he would wild geese for dinner!” added\r\nGebhr.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if it hadn’t been for this dog!”\r\n\r\n“God sent him!”\r\n\r\n“And you wanted to kill him!” said Chamis.\r\n\r\n“From now on no one shall touch him!”\r\n\r\n“He shall always have bones and water!”\r\n\r\n“Allah! Allah!” repeated Idris, without being able to calm down; “and\r\ndeath hung over us! Uf!”\r\n\r\nThey looked with hatred at Stasch, who lay before them, but they were\r\nalso somewhat surprised that this small boy had so nearly caused their\r\ndefeat and destruction.\r\n\r\n“By the prophet!” said one of the Bedouins, “but we must take care that\r\nthis son of Eblis does not break our necks. We owe the Mahdi a snake!\r\nWhat do you intend to do with him?”\r\n\r\n“His right hand must be cut off!” cried Gebhr. The Bedouins made no\r\nreply, but Idris would not allow them to do it. It occurred to him that\r\nif the expedition sent out in search of them should find them, they\r\nwould be punished much more severely if they maimed the boy. And after\r\nall, who could tell whether the boy would not die as the result of the\r\nbeating he had just received? If so, only Nell would remain to be\r\nexchanged for Fatima and her children.\r\n\r\nWhen Gebhr drew a knife to execute his threat Idris grasped him by the\r\nwrist and held him back.\r\n\r\n“No!” he said. “It would be a disgrace if five of the Mahdi’s warriors\r\nwere to fear one beggarly son of a Christian so much that they had to\r\ncut off his hand. Meanwhile we will bind him at night, and for what he\r\nhas just attempted he will receive ten lashes with the scourge.”\r\n\r\nGebhr was ready to carry out the threat at once. But Idris again pushed\r\nhim back and told one of the Bedouins to administer the blows,\r\nwhispering into his ear not to beat him too hard. As Chamis, because he\r\nhad formerly served the engineers, or perhaps for some other reason, did\r\nnot want to interfere in any way, the second Bedouin laid Stasch face\r\ndownward, and the torture was just about to begin when something\r\nunexpected delayed it.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the niche Nell appeared with Saba. Although busy with\r\nher pet, which had rushed into the cave and thrown himself at her feet,\r\nshe had heard the screams of the Arabs, but as Arabs and Bedouins in\r\nEgypt scream on every occasion as if they were murdering one another,\r\nshe paid no attention to this. It was only after she had called Stasch\r\nand received no answer that she went out to see if he had, perhaps,\r\nmounted his camel, and she was terrified when by the first rays of dawn\r\nshe saw Stasch lying on the ground, and above him a Bedouin standing\r\nwith the scourge in his hand. At this sight she began to cry out with\r\nall the power of her childish lungs and to stamp her feet; but when the\r\nBedouin paid no attention to her and gave Stasch the first blow, she\r\nrushed forward and covered the boy with her small body.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin hesitated, for he had not been told to beat the girl, and\r\nmeanwhile she cried out in tones of terror and despair:\r\n\r\n“Saba! Saba!”\r\n\r\nSaba understood, and with one leap he reached the entrance. The hair on\r\nhis neck and back bristled, his eyes glared with a red light, while from\r\nhis chest and his powerful throat came a thundering roar. Then his lips\r\nslowly receded, and his teeth, as well as his inch-long white fangs,\r\nstood out, displaying his bloody gums. The enormous dog now began to\r\nturn his head from right to left, as if he wanted to give the Sudanese a\r\ngood view of his terrible set of teeth and say to them:\r\n\r\n“Look! With these I shall defend the children!”\r\n\r\nThey desisted at once, because they knew that they owed their lives to\r\nSaba and also that any one who attempted to approach Nell at that moment\r\nwould have the enraged animal’s fangs fastened in his throat.\r\n\r\nSo they stood there powerless, looking helplessly and inquiringly at one\r\nanother, as if asking what was to be done now.\r\n\r\nThey hesitated so long that Nell had time to call old Dinah and order\r\nher to cut Stasch’s bonds. Then the boy arose, and laying his hand on\r\nSaba’s head, turned to the assailants:\r\n\r\n“I did not mean to kill you,” he said with clenched teeth, “but only the\r\ncamels.”\r\n\r\nThis speech, which was intended to pacify them, only terrified them the\r\nmore, and they would certainly have attacked Stasch again had not Saba’s\r\nflaming eyes and his still bristling hair kept them back. Gebhr still\r\nwanted to rush at Stasch, but a deep growl pinned him to the spot where\r\nhe stood.\r\n\r\nA short silence ensued—then Idris’ far-resounding voice rang out:\r\n\r\n“Let us break camp! Let us start on our way!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA day, a night, and another day passed, and they still continued\r\ngalloping toward the south, only resting for a short time in the\r\nravines, so as not to tire out the camels too much, to feed them and to\r\ngive them water, and at the same time to attend to their own wants. For\r\nfear of being pursued they turned off more toward the west, as they did\r\nnot need to worry about a supply of water for some time. The rain had\r\nonly lasted seven hours, but it was such a heavy storm that Idris,\r\nGebhr, and the Bedouins knew that enough water could be found for\r\nseveral days to come in the bed of the ravines and in the natural\r\nhollows and cavities made by the rocks. After a great downpour, as is\r\ngenerally the case, the weather was fine. The heavens were cloudless and\r\nthe air so transparent that one could see for an immeasurable distance.\r\nDuring the night the star-strewn firmament shone with the lustre of a\r\nmyriad jewels, and a refreshing coolness came from the desert sand.\r\n\r\nThe humps of the camels had become smaller, but the animals were well\r\nfed and still “keck,” as the Arabs say, which means that they were not\r\ntired out. They ran so fast that the caravan advanced at almost as sharp\r\na pace as on the day they departed from Gharak el-Sultani. Stasch was\r\nsurprised to see that the Bedouins found provisions of maize and dates\r\nin the many narrow passes among the clefts of the rocks protected from\r\nthe rain. That led him to think that certain preparations had been made\r\nbefore they had been kidnapped and that everything had been planned\r\nbeforehand between Fatima, Idris, and Gebhr on one side, and the\r\nBedouins on the other. It was easy to guess that these men were\r\npartisans of and believers in the Mahdi, who wished to capture him, and\r\nthat they were readily drawn into a conspiracy by the Sudanese. In the\r\nvicinity of Fayoum, near Gharak el-Sultani, there were many Bedouins\r\ncamping in the desert with their children and camels, who went to\r\nMedinet or to the railway station trying to earn something. But these\r\ntwo Bedouins Stasch had never seen before; they could not have come from\r\nMedinet, because it seemed they did not know Saba.\r\n\r\nIt also occurred to the boy that perhaps it might be well to try to\r\nbribe them, but when he remembered their enthusiastic cries each time\r\nthe Mahdi’s name was mentioned he knew that this would be impossible.\r\nThe boy did not, however, submit passively to all this, for his heart\r\nwas full of wonderful energy that had only been stimulated by the\r\nmisfortunes he had suffered. “Everything I have undertaken,” he said to\r\nhimself, “has ended in my being beaten black and blue. But even if I\r\nwere beaten every day with the scourge, or killed, I should not cease\r\ntrying to devise for Nell and myself a means of escape from the hands of\r\nthese villains. If the parties searching for us get hold of them, all\r\nthe better; but I shall act as if I did not expect them to come at all.”\r\n\r\nThen when he thought what had happened to him, how these treacherous and\r\ncruel men had taken his gun away, had beaten him with their fists, and\r\nstamped upon him with their feet, he became furiously angry. He not only\r\nfelt that he was conquered, but, proud as he was of being a white man,\r\nhe felt especially humiliated by being subject to them. Above all, he\r\nfelt the wrong done to Nell, and this, together with the exasperation\r\nthat had taken deep root in his heart since his last misfortune, made\r\nhim heartily hate the Sudanese with an irreconcilable hatred. It is\r\ntrue, he had often heard his father say that hatred blinds one, and that\r\nonly those who are unable to rise above it give way to it, but for the\r\npresent he could not suppress it or even hide it.\r\n\r\nHe could not even prevent its being noticed by Idris, who really began\r\nto feel uneasy, for he realized that in case the pursuers were to\r\novertake them he could no longer count on the boy’s interceding for him.\r\nIdris was always ready to undertake the most daring deeds, but, being a\r\nvery sensible man, he said to himself that one must anticipate\r\neverything in case of defeat; in fact, always have a little side-door\r\nopen for escape. Therefore after the last occurrence he wished to get\r\nback a little into Stasch’s good graces, and at the next stopping-place\r\nhe began conversing with him.\r\n\r\n“After what you attempted to do,” he said, “I had to punish\r\nyou—otherwise the others would have beaten you to death; but I told the\r\nBedouins not to hit you too hard.”\r\n\r\nAnd on receiving no answer he continued:\r\n\r\n“Listen; you yourself have said that white people always keep their\r\npromises, and therefore if you will swear to me by your God and by the\r\nhead of this little “Biut” that you will not undertake to do us any\r\nharm, I will not have you bound up at night.”\r\n\r\nEven then Stasch did not answer a word, and it was only by the strange\r\nglint in his eyes that Idris realized he was speaking in vain.\r\n\r\nBut although Gebhr and the Bedouins coaxed him, he did not have Stasch\r\nbound at night. When Gebhr continued to insist, he answered him angrily:\r\n\r\n“Instead of going to sleep, you will keep guard to-night. I have decided\r\nthat henceforth one of us will keep guard while the others sleep.”\r\n\r\nAnd so from this day on relays of guards were arranged. That greatly\r\nhindered, in fact nearly completely frustrated, Stasch’s plans, for each\r\nguard took good care to watch him well. But, on the other hand, the\r\nchildren were given more freedom, and were allowed to be near each other\r\nand converse freely. So at the next halting-place Stasch sat down by\r\nNell to thank her for her assistance. But although he was deeply\r\ngrateful, he was incapable of expressing his respect and affection, and\r\nso he simply began to shake her little hands.\r\n\r\n“Nell,” he said, “you are very good, and I thank you; and besides, let\r\nme tell you that you acted like a person thirteen years old at least.”\r\n\r\nSuch words from Stasch’s lips were the highest praise, and the little\r\ngirl’s heart burned with joy and pride. At this moment it seemed to her\r\nthat there was nothing too great for her to attempt.\r\n\r\n“When I am grown up they will see!” she replied, casting an aggressive\r\nlook in the direction of the Sudanese.\r\n\r\nAs she did not yet know just what had really happened, and why the Arabs\r\nhad attacked Stasch, the boy began to relate how he had made up his mind\r\nto steal the gun, kill the camels, and force their captors to return\r\nwith them to the river.\r\n\r\n“If this had succeeded,” he said, “we should have been free by this\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Did they wake up?” asked the girl with beating heart.\r\n\r\n“They did wake up! That was Saba’s doing; he came running along and\r\nbegan to bark enough to awaken the dead.”\r\n\r\nThen she was angry with Saba.\r\n\r\n“Horrid Saba! For doing that I shall not say a word to him when he comes\r\nrunning up! I shall just tell him that he is bad!”\r\n\r\nAlthough Stasch was not in a laughing mood, he smiled and asked:\r\n\r\n“How can you not speak a word to him and at the same time tell him that\r\nhe is bad?”\r\n\r\nNell elevated her eyebrows to show her annoyance, and with a shy voice\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“He will see that by my face.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe. But he was not to blame, because he did not know what was going\r\non; remember, too, that he came to our assistance.”\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of this somewhat cooled Nell’s anger, but she did not\r\nwish to forgive the evil-doer at once.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” she said; “but a real gentleman ought not to bark when\r\ngreeting you.”\r\n\r\nStasch smiled again.\r\n\r\n“A real gentleman does not bark when greeting you or when saying\r\ngood-by, unless he be a dog, and Saba is a dog.”\r\n\r\nSoon afterward a sad look came in the boy’s eyes; he sighed again and\r\nagain, and then got up from the stone on which they were sitting and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“The worst is that I can not free you.”\r\n\r\nNell stood on tip-toe and put her little arms around his neck. She\r\nwanted to console him, wanted to murmur her thanks close to him, with\r\nher little face on his cheek; but as she could not find appropriate\r\nwords, she merely clung more lovingly to his neck and kissed him on his\r\near. Saba, who was always late—not so much because he could not keep\r\nstep with the camels as because he chased jackals on the way and barked\r\nat the hawks crouching on the rocks—was seen running up and making as\r\nmuch noise as usual. As soon as the children saw him they forgot\r\neverything, and notwithstanding their sorry plight, they began caressing\r\nhim and playing with him as usual, until the Arabs stopped them. Chamis\r\ngave the dog food and water, and then they all remounted and departed in\r\ngreat haste, going farther toward the south.\r\n\r\nThis was the longest ride they had taken at one stretch, eighteen hours\r\nwith but one short halt. Only riding-camels, who have a considerable\r\nsupply of water in their stomachs, can stand such a journey. Idris did\r\nnot spare them, for he feared that the pursuers were surely at his\r\nheels. He realized that they must have started long ago, and conjectured\r\nthat the two engineers were at the head of these expeditions and would\r\nwaste no time. Danger threatened them from the river-side, for it was\r\nquite certain that the sheiks on both banks of the Nile would form\r\nscouting parties to go into the interior of the desert, and would hold\r\nback all travelers going south. Chamis felt certain that the government\r\nand the engineers had offered a great reward for their capture, and that\r\nconsequently the desert was probably filled with searchers. The only way\r\nto avoid these would be to go as far west as possible; but to the west\r\nlay the great oasis of Chargeh, where there was a telegraph. Besides,\r\nwere they to go too far away from the river the water would give out\r\nafter a few days and they would die of thirst. There was also the\r\nquestion of provisions. It is true that in the two weeks preceding the\r\nkidnapping of the children the Bedouins had hidden provisions of maize,\r\nzwieback, and dates in secret places known only to themselves, but these\r\nsecret places were four days’ journey from Medinet. Idris was\r\nterror-stricken at the thought that when the food gave out some of them\r\nwould have to go to the villages on the river-banks to buy provisions,\r\nand that, on account of the strict watch and the rewards offered by the\r\nvillage sheiks for the capture of the fugitives, these might easily fall\r\ninto the hands of the villagers and betray the whole caravan. The\r\nsituation was indeed difficult, almost desperate, and Idris saw more\r\nclearly every day what a wild scheme he had undertaken.\r\n\r\n“If we had only passed Assuan,” said he to himself, his heart full of\r\nfear and despair. He did not believe Chamis, who declared the Mahdi’s\r\nwarriors had already advanced as far as Assuan, for Stasch disputed\r\nthis, and Idris had long noticed that the white boy knew more than all\r\nof them. However, he supposed that beyond the first cataract, where the\r\npeople were more savage and less under the influences of the English\r\npeople and the Egyptian Government, more secret believers in the prophet\r\nwere to be found, who if necessary would help them and supply them with\r\nprovisions and camels. But the Bedouins had calculated that they were\r\nstill about five days’ journey from Assuan.\r\n\r\nThe way led through still more desolate country, and at every halt the\r\nprovisions for man and beast sank lower.\r\n\r\nFortunately, they could drive the camels on, and make them gallop as\r\nfast as they pleased, for the heat had not exhausted the animals’\r\nstrength. In the daytime, during the noon hours, the sun beat down\r\nfiercely upon them, but the air was always fresh and the nights so cool\r\nthat Stasch, with Idris’ permission, mounted Nell’s camel to look after\r\nher health and to protect her from the cold. But his fears were\r\ngroundless, for Dinah, whose eyes had greatly improved, looked carefully\r\nafter her little lady.\r\n\r\nThe boy was surprised that the little one’s health had not suffered, and\r\nthat she stood the journey as well as he, especially when the halts were\r\nbecoming less and less frequent. Sorrow and fear, and the tears which\r\nshe had shed longing for papa, had apparently not done her much harm.\r\nShe had perhaps become a little thin, and her pale face was tanned by\r\nthe wind, but as time went on she stood the journey better than in the\r\nbeginning. Idris had given her the best camel, and had arranged the\r\nsaddle very comfortably so that she could sleep, but it was the fresh\r\ndesert air especially, breathed night and day, that gave her the\r\nstrength to bear the fatigue and discomfort of the journey.\r\n\r\nStasch not only protected her, but he intentionally treated her with a\r\nreverence the depth of which he did not realize, notwithstanding his\r\nunusual attachment for the little one. He noticed that the Arabs also\r\ncaught this attitude, and that it unconsciously strengthened their\r\nconviction that they were carrying along something exceedingly precious,\r\nan especially important prisoner, whom they had to treat most carefully.\r\nIdris had accustomed them to this before leaving Medinet, and so they\r\nall behaved well toward her. They gave her plenty of water and dates.\r\nThe cruel Gebhr dared not raise his hand against her again. Perhaps the\r\nunusual beauty of the girl, and the fact that she looked somewhat like a\r\nflower or a little bird, had its effect, for even the savage and\r\nuncultivated hearts of the Arabs could not resist her charm. Sometimes,\r\nalso, at the halting-places, when she stood around the fire made of\r\nJericho roses, colored with the red light from the flames and the\r\nsilvery light from the moon, the Sudanese and the Bedouins could not\r\ntake their eyes off her, but murmured, according to their custom,\r\nsmacking their lips as a sign of admiration:\r\n\r\n“Allah! Maschallah! Bismillah!”\r\n\r\nAt noon the second day, after traveling that long stretch, Stasch and\r\nNell, who were now riding on the same camel, had a moment of intense\r\njoy. Immediately after sunrise a clear and transparent mist, which,\r\nhowever, soon disappeared, hovered over the desert. But when the sun\r\nrose higher the heat became greater than on the previous days. When the\r\ncamels stood still for a moment there was not a breath of wind stirring,\r\nso that the air, as well as the sand, appeared to slumber in heat,\r\nlight, and silence. The caravan had just reached a large level plain,\r\nunbroken by ravines, when suddenly a wonderful sight presented itself\r\nbefore the children. Groups of slim palms and pepper-trees, orange\r\nplantations, white houses, a small mosque with a towering minaret and\r\nbroad walls, surrounded by gardens, appeared so plainly and so close to\r\nthem that it seemed as though the caravan would be under the trees of an\r\noasis in half an hour.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” cried Stasch. “Nell! Nell! Look!”\r\n\r\nAs Nell raised up she was struck dumb with surprise, but soon after she\r\ncried out with joy:\r\n\r\n“Medinet! To papa! To papa!”\r\n\r\nBut Stasch became pale with emotion.\r\n\r\n“In fact—that may be Chargeh. But no! It must be Medinet. I remember\r\nthe minaret and I even see the windmill on the well.”\r\n\r\nAnd in reality in the distance were distinctly seen the tall windmills\r\nof American wells, resembling large white stars. These stood out so\r\nclearly on the green background of the trees that Stasch’s sharp eye\r\ncould discern the red-painted edges of the spokes of the windmills.\r\n\r\n“That is Medinet!”\r\n\r\nStasch had read in books that in the desert there is an optical illusion\r\nknown as a “mirage,” and that travelers sometimes see oases, towns, rows\r\nof trees, and lakes that are not real, but are produced by atmospheric\r\nconditions, which, due to the reflection of light, cause far-distant\r\nobjects to appear as if nearby. But this time the apparition was so\r\ndistinct that it seemed as if it could be touched, and although he knew\r\nit must be an illusion, he could not doubt that he was looking at the\r\nreal Medinet. There was the little tower on the house of the Moodir, the\r\nround-shaped passage just under the top of the minaret, where the\r\nmuezzin calls the faithful to prayers; there were the familiar groups of\r\ntrees, and especially the windmills! No, this must be the real place. It\r\noccurred to the boy that perhaps the Sudanese, after thinking things\r\nover, had come to the conclusion that they would not be able to escape\r\ntheir pursuers, and, without having told him, were returning to Fayoum.\r\nBut they were so composed that he doubted if this were so. If it were\r\nreally Fayoum, would they look at it with such indifference? For they\r\nsaw the apparition, too, and pointed it out to one another, but their\r\nfaces portrayed no uncertainty or anxiety. Stasch looked at it again,\r\nand perhaps it was this indifference on the part of the Arabs which made\r\nthe picture appear to fade before him. He also thought that if they were\r\nreally returning, the people, being frightened, would have kept closer\r\ntogether. The Bedouins, who by Idris’ orders had for several days ridden\r\non in advance, could no longer be seen, and Chamis, who brought up the\r\nrear, looked in the distance no larger than a hawk flying along the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“The mirage!” said Stasch to himself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Idris approached and cried out to him:\r\n\r\n“Hoh! Drive the camel on! Don’t you see Medinet?”\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be jesting and spoke in such a scornful tone that the\r\nvery faintest shadow of hope that this might be Medinet lying before him\r\nvanished from the boy’s heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  “Idris approached and cried out to him. . . . ‘Don’t you\r\nsee Medinet?’ He spoke in such a scornful tone that all hope vanished\r\nfrom the boy’s heart.” ]\r\n\r\nSadly he turned to Nell to dispel her illusion when something suddenly\r\nhappened which turned the attention of all in another direction.\r\n\r\nAt first one of the Bedouins came galloping up fast toward them, and\r\nwhile still at a distance began to gesticulate with a long Arabian gun\r\nthat did not belong to any one in the caravan. When he reached Idris he\r\nexchanged a few hasty words with him; then the caravan turned toward the\r\ninterior of the desert. After a while the second Bedouin appeared,\r\nleading a fat camel with a saddle on its hump and leather bags hanging\r\ndown from his flanks. Again a short conversation took place, but Stasch\r\ncould not catch a word of it. The caravan rode quickly without a stop\r\ntoward the west, and only halted when it reached a narrow ravine full of\r\nbroken rocks and caves. One of these was so spacious that the Sudanese\r\nwere able to place all the people and camels in it. Although Stasch\r\nthought he knew what had happened, he lay down next to Idris and\r\npretended to go to sleep, hoping that the Arabs, who had scarcely spoken\r\na word about their adventure until now, would soon begin to talk about\r\nit. His hopes were well founded, for soon after, having scattered food\r\nfor the camels, the Bedouins sat down to consult with the Sudanese and\r\nChamis.\r\n\r\n“From now on we must ride only by night and hide in the daytime,” the\r\none-eyed Bedouin said. “In future we will come across many ravines, and\r\nin these we can conceal ourselves securely.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure that it was a guard?” asked Idris.\r\n\r\n“Allah! We spoke to him. It was good that he was alone. He stood\r\nconcealed behind a rock so that we could not see him, but we heard the\r\ncamel’s voice from a distance. Then we slackened our pace and rode so\r\nsoftly that he saw us only when we were a few steps off. He was very\r\nmuch frightened, and tried to point his gun at us. If he had fired, even\r\nif he had not killed one of us, the other guards would have heard the\r\nshot, and so I said to him quickly: ‘Stop! We are pursuing people who\r\nhave carried off two white children, and soon all our company will be\r\nhere.’ The fellow was young and stupid, and so he believed us—though he\r\nmade us swear by the Koran that we were telling the truth. We dismounted\r\nfrom the camels and swore. The Mahdi will forgive us.”\r\n\r\n“And bless you,” said Idris. “Tell us what you did.”\r\n\r\n“When we had sworn,” continued the Bedouin, “I said to the young man:\r\n‘But who can prove to us that you yourself do not belong to the thieves\r\nwho are fleeing with the white children and have left you here to hold\r\nup the pursuers?’ I bade him to swear, too, which he did, and he\r\nbelieved us all the more. We began to question him, asking what orders\r\nhad come from the sheiks along the copper wire, and whether the thieves\r\nwere being pursued in the desert. He replied in the affirmative, and\r\nsaid that they had been promised great rewards; also that all ravines at\r\na distance of two days’ journey from the river were guarded, and that\r\nthere were large baburis (steamers) filled with Englishmen and soldiers\r\ncontinually passing up and down the river.”\r\n\r\n“Neither ships nor soldiers are of any avail against the power of Allah\r\nand the prophet.”\r\n\r\n“It is as you say!”\r\n\r\n“And now tell us how you made way with that fellow?”\r\n\r\nThe one-eyed Bedouin pointed to his companion.\r\n\r\n“Abu Anga,” he said, “then asked him if there were no other guards\r\nnearby, and on his replying in the negative, he suddenly drove his knife\r\ninto his throat, so that the latter never uttered a sound. We threw him\r\ninto a deep hollow and covered him up with stones and thorns. In the\r\nvillage they will think that he has fled to the Mahdi, for he told us\r\nthat such things have happened.”\r\n\r\n“May God bless those who flee, as he has blessed us,” answered Idris.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we have been blessed!” answered Abu Anga. “For now we know we must\r\nkeep three days’ journey away from the river, and besides that we have\r\ncaptured a gun, which we needed, and also a camel to milk.”\r\n\r\n“The bags,” added the one-eyed man, “are filled with water, and there is\r\na fair amount of millet in the saddle bags, but we did not find much\r\npowder.”\r\n\r\n“Chamis has several hundred cartridges, which belong to this white boy’s\r\ngun, which we don’t know how to shoot. But the powder is the same and it\r\nwill also do for our gun.”\r\n\r\nStill Idris became thoughtful as he heard these words, and a very\r\ntroubled look was imprinted on his dark face, for he realized that as\r\none had already been killed, even Stasch’s intervention could not\r\nprotect them from being punished, in case they should now fall into the\r\nhands of the Egyptian Government.\r\n\r\nStasch listened attentively with beating heart. This conversation seemed\r\nlike good news to him, and he was especially glad to hear that parties\r\nhad been sent out to hunt for them, that rewards had been offered, and\r\nthat the sheiks of the tribes along the banks had received orders to\r\nhold up all caravans traveling south. The boy was also greatly pleased\r\non hearing about the ships which steamed up stream with the English\r\nsoldiers. The Dervishes of the Mahdi could fight well with the Egyptian\r\narmy, and even defeat them, but with the English it was quite different,\r\nand Stasch did not doubt a minute that the first battle would end in the\r\nsavage tribes being completely defeated. Thus he consoled himself with\r\nthe thought that even if they were taken to the Mahdi, there was a\r\npossibility that before they got there the Mahdi or the Dervishes might\r\nbe wiped out. But he did not feel so much comforted when he thought that\r\nin this case a journey of a whole week still lay before them, which\r\nwould at least exhaust Nell’s strength, and that during all that time\r\nthey would be in the company of these villains and murderers.\r\n\r\nWhen Stasch thought of the young Arab whom the Bedouins had slaughtered\r\nlike a sheep, he felt very much frightened and sad. He decided not to\r\nsay anything about it to Nell, for fear that it might terrify her and\r\nincrease the sadness she had felt on seeing the illusive pictures of the\r\noasis Fayoum and the town Medinet disappear. Before they had reached the\r\nravine he saw that her eyes were filled with tears. And so, when he had\r\ngotten all the information he wanted out of the story, he pretended to\r\nawake, and went to Nell. She was sitting in a corner next to Dinah\r\neating dates, which she moistened a little with her tears. When she saw\r\nStasch she remembered that not long ago he had praised her behavior as\r\nbeing that of a girl at least thirteen years old, so she clenched a\r\ndate-stone with all her might between her teeth, to help her control her\r\nsobs, that she would not seem like a child again.\r\n\r\n“Nell,” said the boy, “Medinet was an illusion, but I know for certain\r\nthat we are being followed, so don’t worry any more and don’t cry any\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nOn hearing this the girl raised her tear-stained eyes to him, and\r\nanswered in broken phrases:\r\n\r\n“No, Stasch! I do not want to cry—only my eyes—perspire so——”\r\n\r\nAt the same moment her chin began to quiver, large tears fell from\r\nbeneath her closed lids, and she burst out crying. But being ashamed of\r\nthese tears, and expecting Stasch to reprove her for shedding them, she\r\nhid her little head for shame and fear on Stasch’s breast and thus\r\ncompletely moistened his clothes.\r\n\r\nHe now began to console her:\r\n\r\n“Nell, do not be a fountain! Did you see that they have taken a gun and\r\na camel away from some Arab? Do you know what that means? It means that\r\nthe desert is full of guards. These wretches have succeeded in\r\nsurprising a guard this time, but the next time they will be caught\r\nthemselves. Several steamers are keeping watch on the Nile! Of course,\r\nNell, we shall return home, and on a steamer, too. Fear nothing!——”\r\n\r\nHe would have consoled her still longer in this way if a peculiar sound\r\nringing out of the center of the flying sand, which the last hurricane\r\nhad blown into the ravine, had not attracted his attention. This sound\r\nsomewhat resembled the thin metallic music of a whistle. Stasch\r\ninterrupted the conversation and began to listen. Soon afterward similar\r\nsounds, thin and sad, could be heard coming from various directions at\r\nonce. An idea occurred to the boy that perhaps Arabian guards had\r\nsurrounded the ravine and were making signals to one another by means of\r\nwhistles. His heart began to beat. He repeatedly looked at the Sudanese,\r\nin the hope of seeing fear on their faces, but in vain. Idris, Gebhr,\r\nand the two Bedouins calmly chewed zwieback. Chamis was the only one who\r\nappeared surprised, and the sounds continued. After a while Idris got up\r\nand looked out of the cave; then he returned, stopped in front of the\r\nchildren, and said:\r\n\r\n“The sand is beginning to sing.”\r\n\r\nStasch was so curious that for the moment he forgot his resolution not\r\nto speak to Idris again, and asked:\r\n\r\n“The sand? What does that mean?”\r\n\r\n“It often happens; and it means that there will be no more rain for a\r\nlong time. But the heat will not harm us, for until we reach Assuan we\r\nshall ride only by night.”\r\n\r\nAnd he would say no more. Stasch and Nell listened for some time to\r\nthese peculiar sounds, which lasted until the sun went down in the west.\r\nThen night came on and the caravan continued on its journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDuring the day they secreted themselves in places difficult of access,\r\nin the midst of cliffs and rocks, and during the night they hurried on\r\nwithout stopping, until they had passed the first cataract, when at last\r\nthe Bedouins recognized, from the position and shape of the khor, that\r\nAssuan now lay behind them. With this a heavy weight fell from Idris’\r\nshoulders. As they were now suffering for lack of water, they approached\r\nto within half a day’s journey of the river. After Idris had secreted\r\nthe caravan for the following night, he sent all the camels with the\r\nBedouins to the Nile, so that they could drink enough to last for some\r\ntime. The fertile zone along the Nile becomes narrower after leaving\r\nAssuan. In some places the desert reaches to the river. The villages are\r\nsome distance apart, and thus the Bedouins were able to return safely,\r\nhaving been perceived by no one, and with a plentiful supply of water.\r\nNow the only question was how to obtain food, for their animals had had\r\nso little to eat this last week that they had become very thin. Their\r\nnecks were long, their humps sunken in, and their feet weak. The maize\r\nand other food for the party could at a stretch last only two days\r\nlonger. But Idris was of the opinion that at the end of two days’\r\njourney, though traveling only by night, they might approach the\r\npastures near the river, and perhaps be able to buy dates and zwieback\r\nin some village.\r\n\r\nSaba received absolutely nothing more to eat or drink; the children\r\nsaved some scraps for him, but he knew how to help himself out in some\r\nway, for he arrived at the halting-places with a bloody throat and\r\ntraces of bites on his neck and chest. Whether the spoils of these\r\nfights were jackals or hyenas, or perhaps even sand-foxes and gazels, no\r\none ever knew; it sufficed that he did not appear to be very hungry.\r\nSometimes also his black lips were wet, as if he had drunk. The Bedouins\r\nsupposed that he had dug deep holes in the ground of the ravines and in\r\nthis manner had reached water that he had scented through the ground.\r\nSometimes lost travelers dig up the broken earth, and if they do not\r\nalways find water, they nearly always come upon wet sand, and by sucking\r\nthe water out of it quench their painful thirst.\r\n\r\nBut a great change had also come over Saba. His chest and neck were\r\nstill strong, but his flanks were sunken in, which made him look taller.\r\nHis bloodshot eyes had a savage and threatening look. But to Nell and\r\nStasch he was as devoted as ever, and let them do what they liked with\r\nhim; he wagged his tail at Chamis now and then, but at the Bedouins and\r\nSudanese he barked, showed his terrible fangs, and ground his teeth like\r\niron nails. Thus Idris and Gebhr began to be afraid of him, and they\r\nhated him so that they would probably have shot him with the gun they\r\nhad captured if the desire of bringing Smain such a rare specimen of an\r\nanimal, and the fact that they had already left Assuan behind them, had\r\nnot held them back.\r\n\r\nAssuan lay behind them! Stasch continually thought of this, and it\r\nslowly dawned upon him that there was great doubt of the searchers\r\novertaking them. It is true, he knew that not only the so-called\r\nEgypt—which ends below Wadi Halfa, that is, in the vicinity of the\r\nsecond cataract—but also the whole of Nubia, was at this time in the\r\nhands of the Egyptian Government, and he also realized that on the other\r\nside of Assuan, and especially below Wadi Halfa, it would be more\r\ndifficult to search for them, and the orders of the government would be\r\nless promptly executed. However, he still cherished the hope that his\r\nfather and Mr. Rawlison, after having organized the search, would go\r\nalone by steamer from Fayoum to Wadi Halfa, and from there, after having\r\nobtained from the government soldiers mounted on camels, would try to\r\nbar the way of the caravan from the southern side. The boy calculated\r\nthat he would do this if he were so situated, and so he considered that\r\nhe had a good foundation for his supposition.\r\n\r\nHe did not give up the thought of attempting to escape. The Sudanese\r\nwanted powder for the gun they had captured, and to get it they decided\r\nto tear open a number of cartridges; so he told them that he only could\r\ndo it, and that if one of them went clumsily at it the cartridge would\r\nexplode and tear off his hand. Idris, who was usually afraid of strange\r\nthings and English discoveries, in the end decided to trust this work to\r\nthe boy. Stasch was glad to do it, because he hoped that the strong\r\nEnglish powder would burst the old Arabian gun at the first shot, and he\r\nalso hoped to be able to secrete a few cartridges. He found this easier\r\nthan he thought. He was watched while he did it, but the Arabs began to\r\ntalk among themselves, and they were soon paying more attention to their\r\nconversation than to him. This talkativeness and inborn carelessness at\r\nlast permitted Stasch to hide seven cartridges in his breast pocket. Now\r\nit was only a case of gaining possession of the rifle.\r\n\r\nThe boy believed that this would not be very difficult beyond Wadi\r\nHalfa, after the second cataract, for he supposed that the watchfulness\r\nof the Arabs would slacken in proportion as they approached their\r\ndestination. The thought that he would have to kill the Bedouins, the\r\nSudanese, and even Chamis still filled him with terror, but after the\r\nmurder which the Bedouins had committed he had no more scruples. He said\r\nto himself that after all it was a matter of Nell’s defense, of her\r\nfreedom, and of her life, that therefore he ought not to spare the lives\r\nof their enemies, especially if they would not surrender and a fight\r\nshould result. The question was now how to obtain the gun. Stasch\r\ndecided to take it by strategy if he found a suitable opportunity—not\r\nto wait till they reached Wadi Halfa, but to execute his intention as\r\nsoon as possible. And he did not wait.\r\n\r\nTwo days had now elapsed since they passed Assuan, and at last, at\r\ndaybreak of the third day, Idris was obliged to send the Bedouins for\r\nfood, which was now very scarce. Stasch, when he considered that he now\r\nhad fewer opponents, said to himself, “Now or never!” and immediately\r\nturned to the Sudanese with the question:\r\n\r\n“Idris, do you know that the country beginning at Wadi Halfa is Nubia?”\r\n\r\n“I know it. I was fifteen and Gebhr eight years old when our fathers\r\nbrought us from the south to Fayoum, and I remember that at that time we\r\ntraveled all through Nubia on camels. But this country still belongs to\r\nthe Turks (Egyptians).\r\n\r\n“Yes, the Mahdi is only at Khartum—you see how stupidly Chamis talked\r\nwhen he told you that the army of the Dervishes extended as far as\r\nAssuan. But I should like to ask you another question. I have read in\r\nbooks that in Nubia there are many wild animals and thieves, who are no\r\ngood to any one and who attack the Egyptians as well as the faithful\r\nfollowers of the Mahdi. How will you defend yourselves if wild animals\r\nor thieves attack you?”\r\n\r\nStasch purposely exaggerated when speaking of wild animals, but, on the\r\nother hand, since the beginning of the war attacks by robbers had become\r\nquite frequent, especially in the southern parts of the country\r\nbordering on Sudan.\r\n\r\nIdris considered the question a while, for he was not prepared to answer\r\nit because he had not previously thought of these new dangers; then he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“We have knives and a gun.”\r\n\r\n“A gun like yours is of no use.”\r\n\r\n“I know it. Yours is better, but we do not understand it, and we shall\r\nnot give it into your hands.”\r\n\r\n“Even if it is not loaded?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for it might be bewitched.”\r\n\r\nStasch raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Idris, if Gebhr had said this I should not have been surprised; but\r\nyou—I thought you had more sense! With an unloaded gun even the Mahdi\r\ncould not shoot.”\r\n\r\n“Be silent!” interrupted Idris angrily. “The Mahdi can shoot with\r\nnothing but his fingers.”\r\n\r\n“Then _you_ shoot like that yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe Sudanese gazed questioningly into the boy’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why do you want me to give you the gun?”\r\n\r\n“I will teach you how to shoot with it.”\r\n\r\n“What good will that do?”\r\n\r\n“A great deal, for if thieves attack us they might kill all of us! But\r\nif you are afraid of the gun or even of me, then let the matter drop.”\r\n\r\nIdris remained silent. He was really afraid, though he did not want to\r\nown it. But he was very anxious to become acquainted with the English\r\nweapon, for possessing it and knowing how to use it would give him\r\nhigher standing in the camp of the Mahdists—besides which he could more\r\nreadily defend himself in case of an attack.\r\n\r\nSo after considering a while he said:\r\n\r\n“All right. Chamis shall give us the gun and you can take it out of the\r\ncase.”\r\n\r\nChamis followed out the order in a half-hearted way, and Gebhr could\r\noffer no opposition because he was busy nearby with the camels. With\r\ntrembling hands outstretched, Stasch took the barrel, then the butt, and\r\nhanded them to Idris.\r\n\r\n“You see that it is empty,” he said.\r\n\r\nIdris took the barrel and looked through it into the air.\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is nothing in it.”\r\n\r\n“Now pay attention,” said Stasch; “this is the way the gun is put\r\ntogether”—and at the same time he put the butt and the barrel\r\ntogether—“and this is the way it is opened. Do you see? I shall now\r\ntake it apart, and then you may put it together again.”\r\n\r\nThe Sudanese, who followed Stasch’s movements very attentively, tried to\r\ndo likewise, but he did not find it very easy; however, as the Arabs are\r\ngenerally noted for their great dexterity, the gun was put together\r\nafter a while.\r\n\r\n“Open it,” said Stasch.\r\n\r\nIdris opened the gun without any trouble.\r\n\r\n“Close it.”\r\n\r\nThis was done still more easily.\r\n\r\n“Now give me two empty cartridges. I will teach you how to put them in.”\r\n\r\nThe Arabs had kept the empty cartridges, and so Idris handed two of them\r\nto Stasch, and the lesson began again.\r\n\r\nThe Sudanese at first became frightened at the noise which the\r\ncartridges made, but at last he was convinced that one can not shoot\r\nwith the empty barrel of a gun or with empty cartridges. Besides his\r\nconfidence in Stasch also returned, because the boy gave him the weapon\r\nto hold in his hands every few seconds.\r\n\r\n“So,” said Stasch, “you can put the gun together, you can open, shut,\r\npoint, and pull the trigger, but you must also learn how to take aim,\r\nand that is the most difficult of all. Take an empty water-bag and set\r\nit down a hundred paces away—there, on one of those stones, and then\r\ncome back to me. I will show you how to take aim.”\r\n\r\nIdris did not hesitate, but took a leather bag and started to set it up\r\non the designated stone. Before he had gone the first hundred paces\r\nStasch had drawn out the empty cartridges and replaced them with charged\r\nones. Stasch’s heart and temples began to throb so violently that he\r\nthought his head would split. The decisive moment had come—the moment\r\nof freedom for Nell and himself—the terrible and longed-for moment of\r\nvictory!\r\n\r\nNow Idris’ life was in his hands. One pull on the trigger and the\r\ntraitor who carried off Nell would fall dead. But Stasch, in whose veins\r\nflowed Polish and French blood, suddenly felt that nothing in the world\r\ncould tempt him to shoot one whose back was toward him. For ought he not\r\nat least have the privilege of turning around and looking death in the\r\nface? And what would happen then? Then Gebhr would come running up, and\r\nbefore he had taken ten steps he, too, would lie writhing in the sand.\r\nThen there was Chamis, but the latter would lose his head, and even if\r\nhe did not Stasch would have time to reload the gun. When the Bedouins\r\nreturned they would find the three bodies and they themselves would meet\r\ntheir deserts. All that remained to be done would be to guide the camels\r\ntoward the river.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts raced through Stasch’s head like a whirlwind. He felt\r\nthat the deed to be committed in a few seconds was most terrible, but at\r\nthe same time most necessary. Pride of victory battled in his breast\r\nwith feelings of horror and distaste of the means necessary for mastery.\r\nHe hesitated only a moment when he remembered the tortures that white\r\nprisoners had suffered; and at the thought of his father, of Mr.\r\nRawlison, of Nell, and of Gebhr, who had beaten the girl with the\r\nscourge, he became more bitter against them. “It must be! It must be!”\r\nhe cried through his clenched teeth, and his unalterable resolution\r\nshowed in his face, which was now set as if carved out of flint.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Idris had laid the leather bag down on a stone a hundred feet\r\noff and turned around. Stasch saw his smiling face and tall figure on\r\nthe flat, sandy plain. For the last time the thought flashed through his\r\nmind that this man, now living, would shortly fall to earth and grovel\r\nin the sand in his death agony. But the boy hesitated no longer, and\r\nwhen Idris was fifty feet nearer he slowly lifted the weapon to his\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nBut before he had time to place his finger on the trigger a loud voice\r\nwas heard in the direction of the sand-dunes several hundred feet away,\r\nand at the same moment about twenty riders on horses and camels appeared\r\non the plain. Idris was struck dumb at the sight; Stasch was no less\r\nsurprised, but his surprise was soon changed to the greatest joy. At\r\nlast these must be the people sent in search of them, for whom they had\r\nwaited so long! Yes, it must be! Doubtless the Bedouins had been\r\ncaptured in the village, and had confessed where the caravan was hidden.\r\nIdris must have had the same idea, for after recovering from his first\r\nfright he came running up to Stasch, his face pale with terror, and\r\nkneeling at his feet, repeated in a gasping voice:\r\n\r\n“Sir, remember that I have been good to you! I have been good to the\r\nlittle Biut.”\r\n\r\nStasch mechanically took the cartridges out of the gun and gazed at the\r\nriders, who galloped up to them as quickly as their animals could carry\r\nthem, and with cries of joy tossed their long Arabian guns in the air\r\nand caught them again most dexterously while the animals were still\r\ngalloping. In the clear, transparent light they could be distinctly\r\nseen. At their head galloped two Bedouins, who were gesticulating most\r\nviolently with their hands and burnooses.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the whole company reached the caravan. Several of the\r\nriders sprang off the horses and camels; others remained in their\r\nsaddles continually shouting. But all that could be understood were two\r\nwords: “Khartum! Gordon! Gordon! Khartum!”\r\n\r\nOne of the Bedouins, whom his companion called Abu Anga, at last rushed\r\nup to Idris, who was crouching at Stasch’s feet, and cried:\r\n\r\n“Khartum has fallen! Gordon is dead! The Mahdi is triumphant!”\r\n\r\nIdris stood up, but did not believe his ears.\r\n\r\n“And these people?” he asked, his lips trembling.\r\n\r\n“These people were supposed to capture us, but now they are going to\r\naccompany us to the prophet.”\r\n\r\nEverything grew dark before Stasch’s eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nThe last hope of escaping during the journey had entirely disappeared.\r\nStasch knew that nothing he could think of would now be of any avail; he\r\nrealized that the searching parties would not overtake them, and that if\r\nthey survived the fatigue of the journey, they would reach the Mahdi and\r\nbe surrendered to Smain. His only comforting thought was that they were\r\nbeing carried off for Smain to exchange them for his children. But when\r\nwould that take place, and what would they have to endure beforehand?\r\nWhat terrible fate awaited them in the midst of a bloodthirsty, savage\r\ntribe? Whether Nell would be able to stand the fatigue and privations no\r\none could tell. On the other hand, it was certain that the Mahdi and his\r\nDervishes hated Christians and Europeans; and so in the boy’s heart\r\nthere arose a fear as to whether Smain’s influence would be powerful\r\nenough to protect them against defamation, mistreatment, cruelty, and\r\nthe rage of the Mahdists, who murdered even Mohammedans who were loyal\r\nto the government. For the first time since they were carried off Stasch\r\ngave himself up to despair, and a somewhat superstitious expectation\r\nthat misfortune was following them took possession of him. For was not\r\nthe idea of carrying them off from Fayoum and bringing them to Khartum\r\nin itself perfect madness, that only stupid and savage people like Idris\r\nand Gebhr would entertain, because they did not consider that they had\r\nto travel thousands of kilometers in a land that was under Egyptian, or,\r\nmore strictly speaking, under English, control? If things had gone as\r\nthey naturally should, they would have been found the very next day; as\r\nthings were, they were now in the vicinity of the second cataract. None\r\nof the other caravans sent to search for them had overtaken them, and\r\nthe members of the last one which might have held them up had even\r\njoined their kidnappers and placed themselves at their service. Stasch’s\r\ndespair, and his anxiety as to what would be the fate of little Nell,\r\nwas augmented by his feeling of humiliation that up to this time none of\r\nhis plans had succeeded, and what was worse, that he could not devise\r\nnew ones, for even though the gun and cartridges had been returned to\r\nhim, he could not shoot down all the Arabs now in the caravan.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts troubled him all the more because deliverance had been so\r\nvery near. If Khartum had not fallen, or had fallen only a few days\r\nlater, the same people who had now gone over to the Mahdi’s side would\r\nhave captured the kidnappers and delivered them over to the government.\r\nStasch, sitting behind Idris on the camel and listening to their\r\nconversation, soon convinced himself that this would certainly have been\r\nthe course; for no sooner had they started on again than the leader of\r\nthe pursuing party began to tell Idris what had caused them to betray\r\nthe Khedive. They had known that a large army, not Egyptian, but\r\nEnglish, under command of General Wolseley, had gone toward the south to\r\nfight against the Dervishes. They had seen a number of boats which the\r\nterrible English had taken from Assuan to Wadi Halfa, where a railroad\r\nwas being built to convey their soldiers as far as Abu Hammed. For some\r\ntime all sheiks on the banks of the Nile—those who remained true to the\r\ngovernment as well as those who secretly sympathized with the\r\nMahdi—were convinced that the destruction of the Dervishes and of their\r\nprophet was inevitable, for no one had ever conquered the English.\r\n\r\n“Allah Akbar!” interrupted Idris, as he raised his hands in the air,\r\n“and yet they have been conquered!”\r\n\r\n“No!” replied the leader. “The Mahdi let the Dschalno, Berbers, and\r\nDadschim tribes and thirty thousand of his best warriors commanded by\r\nMusa, the son of Helu, take the field against them. At Abu Klea a\r\nterrible battle was fought, in which God gave the victory to the\r\nunbelievers. Musa, the son of Helu, fell, and only a small remnant of\r\nhis army returned to the Mahdi. The souls of the rest are in Paradise\r\nand their bodies lie in the sand, awaiting the day of resurrection. The\r\nnews of this battle was soon spread along the banks of the Nile. Then we\r\nthought that the English would advance further south and release\r\nKhartum. The people cried ‘The end! The end!’ Meanwhile it pleased God\r\nto make other plans.”\r\n\r\n“How? What has happened?” asked Idris, feverishly excited.\r\n\r\n“What has happened?” continued the leader, his face beaming. “Meanwhile,\r\nthe Mahdi took Khartum, and during the battle Gordon’s head was cut off,\r\nand as the English were only interested in Gordon, when they heard of\r\nhis death they returned to the north again. Allah! We saw ship-loads of\r\nsoldiers going up the river, but we did not know what that meant. The\r\nEnglish naturally only spread good news; bad news they keep to\r\nthemselves. Therefore some of our party said that the Mahdi had fallen.\r\nBut in the end the truth came to light. It is a fact that this land\r\nwhere we are still belongs to the government. In Wadi Halfa, and as far\r\nsouth as the third and perhaps the fourth cataract, the Khedive’s\r\nsoldiers may still be seen, but now that the English have retreated we\r\nfirmly believe that the Mahdi will conquer not only Nubia and Egypt,\r\nMecca and Medina, but the whole world. And instead of taking you\r\nprisoners and giving you over to the government, we are going to\r\naccompany you to the prophet.”\r\n\r\n“So then orders have been given to capture us?”\r\n\r\n“In every village, to all the sheiks, and at all military stations. To\r\nplaces that could not be reached by the copper wire along which the\r\norders from Cairo were sent, policemen were ordered to make the\r\nannouncement that whoever captured you would receive a reward of a\r\nthousand pounds. Maschallah! That is a large fortune! A large one!”\r\n\r\nIdris looked suspiciously at the speaker.\r\n\r\n“And you prefer the blessing of the Mahdi?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and besides, he has captured so much spoil and so much money in\r\nKhartum that he shovels out Egyptian pounds by the bagful and divides it\r\namong the faithful——”\r\n\r\n“But if the Egyptian soldiers are still in Wadi Halfa, and further\r\nsouth, they may capture us on the road.”\r\n\r\n“No! But we must be quick, before they get their bearings; for since the\r\nEnglish have retreated they all have lost their senses, sheiks loyal to\r\nthe government as well as the soldiers and police. Every one believes\r\nthat the Mahdi will appear at any minute, and so those of us who are\r\nsecretly his followers are fleeing to him; no one hinders us, for there\r\nis so much confusion that no one gives orders, and no one knows whom to\r\nobey.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is so!” answered Idris. “But you were right in saying that we\r\nmust hurry, before they recover their senses, for it is still quite a\r\ndistance to Khartum——”\r\n\r\nStasch, who had carefully listened to this whole conversation, felt a\r\nmomentary feeble ray of hope flickering in his heart. If the Egyptian\r\nsoldiers are still occupying several places in Nubia along the banks of\r\nthe Nile, then—as the English had taken all the ships with them—they\r\nmust get beyond reach of the tribes of the Mahdi by going along the\r\nroad. And in this case it might happen that the caravan would meet the\r\nretreating soldiers and be surrounded by them. Stasch also calculated\r\nthat it would take a much longer time for the news of the capture of\r\nKhartum to reach the Arabian tribes living to the north of Wadi Halfa,\r\nespecially as the Egyptian Government and the English were trying to\r\nkeep their defeat a secret; so he supposed that the lawlessness that\r\nmust have taken place at first among the Egyptians must be quite over by\r\nthis time. It never occurred to the inexperienced boy that the fall of\r\nKhartum and the death of Gordon would occupy the attention of the people\r\nto the exclusion of everything else, and that the sheiks loyal to the\r\ngovernment and the local officials would now have other things to do\r\nthan to think of the deliverance of two white children. In fact, the\r\nArabs who joined their caravan had not the least fear of being pursued.\r\nThough they traveled very rapidly and did not spare the camels, they\r\nremained near the Nile, and often at night they turned toward the river\r\nto water the animals and to fill the leather bags. Sometimes they even\r\nrisked riding into the villages in broad daylight. Nevertheless, to make\r\nthings doubly safe, they sent several people in advance to reconnoiter,\r\nwho made an excuse of buying provisions, to find out the news of the\r\ndistrict—whether all the Egyptian soldiers had left the neighborhood\r\nand whether the inhabitants were partisans of the Turks (Egyptians).\r\nWhen they came upon a place whose inhabitants secretly sympathized with\r\nthe Mahdi, the whole caravan rode into the village, and it often\r\nhappened that when the caravan left the place it was joined by several\r\nyoung Arabs desirous of fleeing to the Mahdi.\r\n\r\nIdris also learned that nearly all the Egyptian detachments were in the\r\nNubian desert, and therefore on the right, the eastern side of the Nile;\r\nand to prevent meeting them they would be obliged to follow the left\r\nbank and go around the larger towns and settlements. That lengthened the\r\njourney, for the river beginning at Wadi Halfa makes an enormous curve,\r\nwhich at first stretches out far toward the south and then turns off\r\ntoward the northeast as far as Abu Hammed, where it takes a more\r\nsoutherly direction; but, on the other hand, this left bank, especially\r\nsouth of the oasis of Selimeh, was practically unguarded, and the\r\nSudanese found the journey quite pleasant, owing to their increased\r\nnumbers, and the plentiful supply of food and water. After the third\r\ncataract was passed there was no need to hurry, and so they rode only by\r\nnight, hiding themselves during the day between the hills or in the\r\nravines. Now a cloudless sky hung over them, gray and quiet on the\r\nhorizon and in the middle vaulted like a large dome. Every day they\r\nadvanced toward the south the heat became more and more unbearable, and\r\neven in the narrow passes and through the deepest shade the heat beat\r\ndown upon the caravan. But to offset this the nights were very cold, and\r\nthe heavens were sprinkled with shining stars that seemed to cluster in\r\nlarge and small groups. Stasch noticed that they were not the same\r\nconstellations as those in Port Said. He had dreamed one day of seeing\r\nthe southern cross, and now he really saw it behind El-Ordeh, and its\r\nlight only prophesied misfortune for him. For several evenings the pale\r\ntwinkling of the somber zodiacal stars lighted up the west side of the\r\nheavens for some time after the sun had set.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after leaving the district of Wadi Halfa the caravan entered\r\nthe land that had been conquered by the Mahdi. They galloped over the\r\nhilly desert of El-Gesireh (Dschesirah) and in the vicinity of Schendi,\r\nwhere the English had previously inflicted a crushing defeat upon Musa’s\r\narmy, they crossed a district which in nowise resembled a desert. Here\r\nthere were no sand plains or hillocks. As far as the eye could reach\r\nextended a steppe of partly green grass and jungle, where grew groups of\r\nthe prickly acacias that yield the well-known Sudanese rubber. Here and\r\nthere they came across enormous trees with such wide-spreading branches\r\nthat a hundred people could take shelter from the sun under them. From\r\ntime to time the caravan passed high, pillar-like hills covered with\r\nants, which grow all over equatorial Africa. The green of the pastures\r\nand acacias, after the monotonous dull color of the desert sand, was\r\nmore than grateful to the eye. Here Stasch and Nell for the first time\r\nbeheld enormous zizyphus[8] trees and equally large oaks. They also saw\r\nlarge dog-headed baboons, that on catching sight of Saba showed their\r\nanger by their quick motions and by snarling, but did not venture to\r\nattack him.\r\n\r\nIn places where the steppe somewhat resembled a meadow a great many\r\ncamels grazed, guarded by armed warriors of the Mahdi. At the sight of\r\nthe caravan the guards jumped up like birds of prey, ran toward them,\r\nhemmed them in on all sides, and shaking their spears and crying aloud,\r\nquestioned them as to where they came from, why they were coming from\r\nthe north, and where they were going. Sometimes they assumed such a\r\nthreatening manner that Idris was obliged to answer the questions at\r\nonce to avoid being attacked.\r\n\r\nStasch, who had supposed that the only difference between the\r\ninhabitants of Sudan and the Arabs living in Egypt consisted in their\r\nbelief in the Mahdi, and their unwillingness to recognize the authority\r\nof the Khedive, found that he had been greatly mistaken. Most of those\r\nwho now constantly held up the caravan had a darker complexion than\r\nIdris and Gebhr, and, compared with the Bedouins, seemed almost black.\r\nThere was more negro than Arabian blood in their veins. Their faces and\r\nthe upper parts of their bodies were tattooed in various designs or with\r\nphrases from the Koran. Some of them were almost naked, others wore\r\n“Dschubis,” or coats of white woolen texture, finished off with colored\r\npatches. Many had branches of coral or pieces of ivory drawn through\r\ntheir noses, lips, and ears. The chiefs covered their heads with white\r\ncaps, of the same material as their coats. The ordinary soldiers were\r\nbareheaded, but their skulls were not shaven like those of the Arabs of\r\nEgypt; on the contrary, they were covered with coarse, disheveled hair,\r\nwhich was often colored red and almost burned up by the chalk with which\r\nit was rubbed as a protection against vermin. Their weapons were mostly\r\nspears, which they could wield with fatal dexterity, and they had plenty\r\nof Remington rifles, captured in their victorious battles with the\r\nEgyptian army, and also after the fall of Khartum. On the whole, their\r\nappearance was enough to frighten any one. Their behavior toward the\r\ncaravan was hostile, for they suspected that it was made up of Egyptian\r\nmerchants, whom the Mahdi had, directly after the victory, forbidden to\r\nenter Sudan. While they surrounded the caravan they screamed and\r\nbrandished their spears at the breasts of the men, or pointed the\r\nbarrels of their guns at them, whereupon Idris’ voice arose above their\r\nshrieks; he told them that he and his brother belonged to the Dangali\r\ntribe, the same to which the Mahdi belonged, and that they were taking\r\nthe white children as prisoners to the prophet. This alone withheld the\r\nsavages from laying violent hands on them. When at last Stasch fully\r\nrealized this terrible truth, his heart was heavy at the thought of what\r\nthey still had to look forward to during the days that were to follow.\r\nEven Idris, who had lived for years in a civilized land, could not\r\nimagine anything more dreadful; and he was glad when an armed division\r\nof the Emir Nur-el-Tadhil surrounded their caravan one evening and took\r\nthem to Khartum.\r\n\r\nBefore Nur-el-Tadhil had fled to the Mahdi he had been an officer in one\r\nof the Khedive’s negro regiments, and since he was not so savage as the\r\nother Mahdists, Idris was better able to get along with him. But even\r\nhere he was doomed to be disappointed. He had imagined that his arrival\r\nwith white children in the camp of the Mahdi would, in consideration of\r\nthe terrible fatigue and the dangers of the journey, arouse admiration.\r\nHe hoped that the Mahdists would receive him enthusiastically and lead\r\nhim in triumph to the prophet, and that the latter would lavish gold and\r\npraise upon him who had rendered such service to his relative, Fatima.\r\nBut the Mahdists brandished their spears against the caravan, while\r\nNur-el-Tadhil listened languidly to the description of the journey. When\r\nat last he was asked if he knew Smain, the husband of Fatima, he said:\r\n\r\n“No; in Omdurman and Khartum there are more than a hundred thousand\r\nwarriors, so it is impossible for them to know one another; even all the\r\nofficers are not acquainted. The kingdom of the prophet is exceedingly\r\nlarge and therefore many emirs rule over the distant towns in the\r\ndistricts of Sennaar, Kordofan, Darfur, and near Fashoda. It may be that\r\nthis Smain of whom you speak is not in the neighborhood of the prophet\r\njust now.”\r\n\r\nIdris felt rather hurt by the disdainful tone with which Nur spoke of\r\n“this Smain,” and so he answered rather impatiently:\r\n\r\n“Smain is married to a cousin of the Mahdi, and thus Smain’s children\r\nare relatives of the prophet.”\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi has many relatives and can not remember them all.”\r\n\r\nFor a while they rode on in silence, then Idris again asked:\r\n\r\n“When shall we arrive in Khartum?”\r\n\r\n“Before midnight,” answered Tadhil, looking at the stars, which began to\r\nappear on the western side of the heavens.\r\n\r\n“Shall I be able to get provisions and fodder at such a late hour? We\r\nhave not eaten anything since our noon-day rest.”\r\n\r\n“You may sleep and eat at my house to-night, but to-morrow, in Omdurman,\r\nyou must provide your own food, and I warn you in advance it will not be\r\nvery easy.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“On account of the war. The people have not cultivated the fields in\r\nmany years, but have lived on meat, and when the cattle gave out a\r\nfamine ensued. Throughout the entire south a famine reigns, and to-day a\r\nsack of maize costs more than a slave.”\r\n\r\n“Allah Akbar!” cried Idris, astonished. “Did I not see a great many\r\ncamels and herds of cattle on the steppe?”\r\n\r\n“Those belong to the prophet, to the nobles,[9] and the califs. Yes, the\r\nDangalis, from whose tribe come the Mahdi, and the Baggars, whose\r\nchieftain is the chief calif Abdullah, still have herds in plenty, but\r\nlife is harder and harder for the other tribes.”\r\n\r\nHere Nur-el-Tadhil tapped his stomach and said:\r\n\r\n“In the service of the prophet I have a higher place, more money, and\r\ngreater power, but in the service of the Khedive I had a larger\r\nstomach.”\r\n\r\nAs he feared he might have said too much, he added:\r\n\r\n“But this will all be a thing of the past when the true faith conquers.”\r\n\r\nWhen Idris heard this remark he unconsciously thought of how he, too,\r\nwhen in Fayoum and in the service of the English, had never suffered\r\nfrom hunger, and that he could easily earn money, and he became very\r\nsad.\r\n\r\nThen he asked more questions:\r\n\r\n“So to-morrow you will take us to Omdurman?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. By order of the prophet, Khartum is to be depopulated, and there\r\nare now very few people there. The larger houses are being pulled down,\r\nand the material will be taken along with the remaining spoil to\r\nOmdurman. The prophet will not live in a town that is tainted by\r\nunbelievers.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow I shall fall at his feet, and he will have me supplied with\r\nprovisions and fodder.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! If you really belong to the tribe of Dangali perhaps you may be\r\nadmitted to his presence. But you must know that his house is guarded\r\nnight and day by a hundred men armed with scourges, who do not spare\r\ntheir blows on those who attempt to reach the Mahdi without permission.\r\nOtherwise the people would not give the holy man a minute’s peace.”\r\n\r\n“Allah! I myself have seen Dangalis with bloody stripes on their backs.”\r\n\r\nEvery minute Idris’ disappointment increased.\r\n\r\n“So the believers,” he asked, “can not see the prophet?”\r\n\r\n“The believers see him daily at the place of prayer, when he kneels on a\r\nsheepskin and raises his hands to God, or when he teaches the people and\r\nstrengthens them in their faith. But it is very difficult to be admitted\r\nto his presence and to talk to him, and whoever is allowed this\r\nhappiness attracts the jealousy of every one else, for upon him God’s\r\ngrace descends, blotting out his past sins.”\r\n\r\nNow suddenly it grew dark, and became piercing cold. In the ranks of the\r\ncaravan the horses could be heard neighing, and the sudden change from\r\nthe heat of the day to the cold was so great that the steam arose from\r\nthe horses, and the party rode as through a mist. Stasch leaned over\r\nbehind Idris’ back toward Nell and asked:\r\n\r\n“Are you not cold?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the girl, “but—there will be no one to protect us——”\r\n\r\nTears drowned the rest of the sentence.\r\n\r\nStasch was unable to find words to comfort her, for he felt convinced\r\nthat they would not regain their freedom. They were now in a land of\r\nmisery, of bestial cruelty, and of bloodshed. They were like two\r\nmiserable little leaves in the midst of a storm, which not only brought\r\ndeath and destruction to individuals, but to whole towns and tribes.\r\nWhat hand could save two small, helpless children?\r\n\r\nThe moon slowly arose in the heavens and turned the branches of the\r\nmimosas and acacias into silver feathers. In the thick jungles sounded\r\nthe shrill, joyous laughter of the hyenas, who in this bloodthirsty\r\nstretch of land found more human corpses than they could devour. From\r\ntime to time the division which led the caravan met other patrols and\r\nexchanged the arranged password with them. At last they climbed down the\r\nhigh banks and reached the Nile through a long ravine. The people,\r\nhorses, and camels were shipped on large barges, and soon the measured\r\nsweep of the heavy oars cut the smooth surface of the water, illuminated\r\nby the light of the myriad stars.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later lights could be seen on the southern side, toward\r\nwhich the boats were steering, and the nearer they approached this\r\ncluster of lights, the more brilliant was the red glow reflected on the\r\nwater. Nur-el-Tadhil nudged Idris, then pointed with his hand and said:\r\n\r\n“Khartum!”\r\n\r\nThey halted at the farther end of the town, in front of a house which\r\nformerly belonged to a rich Italian merchant, who had been killed during\r\nthe attack on the town, and afterward, when the spoils were divided, the\r\nhouse had fallen to Tadhil’s share. The wives of the emir were gentle\r\nand kind to Nell, who was nearly dead from fatigue, and although food\r\nwas very scarce in Khartum, they found a few dried dates and some rice\r\nand honey for the little one; then they led the child to the top floor\r\nand put her to bed. Stasch, who spent the night in the open between the\r\ncamels and horses, had to content himself with a zwieback, but he had\r\nplenty of water, for strange to say the fountain in the garden had not\r\nbeen destroyed. Although he was very tired, he could not get to sleep\r\nfor a long while. He was kept awake by the scorpions, which crept all\r\nnight over the cloth rug on which he lay, and then again because he was\r\ndeathly afraid that he might be separated from Nell and not be able to\r\nwatch over her any longer. Saba, who continually sniffed around, and\r\nhowled from time to time, annoying the soldiers, seemed to be equally\r\nworried. Stasch quieted him as best he could, fearing that some one\r\nmight harm him. The enormous creature, however, was greatly admired by\r\nthe emir and by all the Dervishes, and no one would have attempted to\r\ninjure him in any way.\r\n\r\nNor did Idris sleep. He had felt indisposed all day, and besides this,\r\nafter his talk with Nur-el-Tadhil many of his illusions had been\r\ndispelled, and he saw the future now as through a dark veil. He was glad\r\nthat on the morrow they were to travel on to Omdurman, which is only\r\nseparated from Khartum by the White Nile. He hoped to find Smain, but\r\nwhat then? During the journey everything had looked clear and distinct\r\nand so much grander to him. He frankly believed in the prophet, and his\r\nheart was drawn more toward him because they both belonged to the same\r\ntribe. But, like most Arabs, he was also greedy for gain, and ambitious.\r\nHe had imagined that he would be deluged with gold, and that he would at\r\nleast be made an emir, and dreamed of campaigns against the “Turks,” of\r\ncaptured towns, and spoils. But now, from what Tadhil had told him, he\r\nbegan to fear that on account of exceedingly important events that had\r\ntaken place, his deeds would disappear like rain in the ocean.\r\n“Perhaps,” he thought with bitter regret, “scarcely any one will pay any\r\nattention to what I have done, and Smain will not even be grateful that\r\nI have brought him these children.” This thought vexed him. The\r\napproaching day would decide whether or not his fears were well founded,\r\nand he waited for it impatiently.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock the sun rose, and the Dervishes began to bestir\r\nthemselves. Shortly after Tadhil appeared and ordered them to get ready\r\nto depart. He told them also that until they reached the place where\r\nthey crossed the river they would have to walk alongside of his horse.\r\n\r\nTo Stasch’s great joy, Dinah brought Nell down from the top floor; then\r\nthey went through the whole town, following the wall, until they came to\r\nthe place where their transports were moored. Tadhil rode in front, and\r\nbehind him came Stasch leading Nell by the hand; they were followed by\r\nIdris, Gebhr, and Chamis, old Dinah and Saba and thirty of the emir’s\r\nsoldiers. The rest of the caravan remained in Khartum.\r\n\r\nStasch looked around with interest. He could not understand how such a\r\nstrongly fortified town—which lay in a fork made by the White Nile and\r\nthe Blue Nile, and therefore surrounded on three sides by water, and\r\nonly accessible from the south—could fall. But later the Christian\r\nslaves told him that the water in the river at that time was so low that\r\nwide plains of sand were laid bare, and this made the walls much more\r\naccessible. The garrison had given up all hope of succor; the soldiers,\r\nexhausted by hunger, were unable to stem the rush of the angry tribes,\r\nand so the town was captured and the inhabitants slain. Although a month\r\nhad passed since the invasion, traces of the fight could be seen all\r\nalong the wall, on the inside of which towered ruined houses, which were\r\nthe objects of the conquerors’ first onslaught, and the moat running\r\naround the fortress was choked with corpses, which no one seemed\r\ninclined to bury.\r\n\r\nOn their way to the river-crossing Stasch counted more than four hundred\r\nbodies, which the Sudanese sun had dried up like mummies. They were all\r\nthe color of gray parchment, so that one could not distinguish which\r\nwere Europeans, Egyptians, or negroes. Among the corpses moved numbers\r\nof small gray lizards, which on the approach of the caravan quickly\r\nflitted behind the human remains, taking refuge either in a mouth or\r\nbetween the shriveled ribs.\r\n\r\nStasch managed to prevent Nell seeing all of this terrible sight, and\r\nsucceeded in directing her attention the other way, toward the town. But\r\neven there were scenes that filled the eyes and heart of the girl with\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the captured English children and of Saba, who was led on a\r\nleash by Chamis, attracted a crowd that increased every minute as the\r\nparty approached the river-crossing. After a while such a mob collected\r\nthat the party had to stop. On all sides threatening cries were heard.\r\nTerrible tattooed faces bent over Stasch and Nell. Most of the savages\r\nburst out laughing in derision when they saw them, beating their sides\r\nwith joy; some cursed them, and others roared like wild beasts as they\r\nshowed their white teeth and rolled their eyes. At last they began to\r\nthreaten them and to brandish knives. Nell, half fainting from fright,\r\nclung close to Stasch, and he protected her as best he could, firmly\r\nconvinced that their last hour had come. Fortunately Tadhil could no\r\nlonger stand the angry crowd, and at his command some soldiers\r\nsurrounded the children, while others began to beat the howling mob most\r\nmercilessly with scourges. Those in front dispersed, but still a great\r\ncrowd followed the party with savage yells until they had boarded the\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nThe children breathed freely again while crossing the river. Stasch\r\nconsoled Nell by telling her that when the Dervishes became accustomed\r\nto seeing them they would cease to threaten them, and he assured her\r\nthat Smain would protect and defend them both, and especially her, for\r\nif anything serious were to happen to them he would have no one to\r\nexchange for his own children. That was true, but the attacks they had\r\njust encountered so terrified the girl that she seized Stasch’s hand and\r\nwould not let go of it for a second; at the same time she cried out over\r\nand over again in a feverish way, “I’m afraid! I’m afraid!” Stasch\r\nwished with all his heart that they would reach Smain as soon as\r\npossible, for he had known them for some time and had been very friendly\r\nto them in Port Said, or at least had feigned to be. At any rate, he was\r\nnot so savage as the other Sudanese and Dangalis, and captivity in his\r\nhouse would be more endurable than this.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if Smain were known in Omdurman. Idris broached the subject\r\nto Nur-el-Tadhil, and the latter at last remembered that a year before,\r\nthrough orders given by Calif Abdullah, who lived in Kordofan, quite a\r\ndistance from Khartum, he had heard of a person of that name. This Smain\r\nhad taught the Dervishes how to fire the cannon captured from the\r\nEgyptians, and later had become a great slave-hunter. He gave Idris the\r\nfollowing instructions in regard to seeing the emir:\r\n\r\n“When you hear the sound of the umbaja[10] in the afternoon, be with the\r\nchildren at the place of prayer, where the prophet goes daily to inspire\r\nthe faithful with an example of piety and to strengthen their belief.\r\nThere you will see the Mahdi himself and all the nobles, also the three\r\ncalifs, the pashas, and the emirs, and among the emirs you can surely\r\npick out Smain.”\r\n\r\n“What shall I do and where shall I go until the time for afternoon\r\nprayers?”\r\n\r\n“You will remain with my soldiers.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Nur-el-Tadhil, will you leave us?”\r\n\r\n“I must go to Calif Abdullah for my orders.”\r\n\r\n“Is he the greatest of the Califs? I come from a distance, and although\r\nI have been told the names of the leaders, I would welcome further\r\ninformation regarding them.”\r\n\r\n“Abdullah, my leader, is the Mahdi’s sword.”\r\n\r\n“May Allah make him the son of victory!”\r\n\r\nFor a while the boats went silently along. All was still save for the\r\nsliding of the oars against the thole-pins; now and then the furious\r\nsplashing of water lashed into foam by the tails of disturbed crocodiles\r\nwas heard. Many of these reptiles had come up the river from the south\r\nas far as Khartum; here they found plenty of food, for the river was\r\nstrewn with corpses, the bodies of those slain when the town was\r\nattacked as well as of those who had died of the diseases that raged\r\namong the Mahdists, especially among their slaves. The califs had\r\nordered that the water should not be polluted, but this had been\r\ncompletely disregarded, and the bodies that the crocodiles did not deign\r\nto touch floated face downward as far as the sixth cataract, and still\r\nfarther, even as far as Barbary.\r\n\r\nBut Idris was now thinking of something else; after a while he said:\r\n\r\n“We had nothing to eat this morning; are we to go hungry till the hour\r\nof prayer, and who will supply us with food later on?”\r\n\r\n“You are not a slave,” answered Tadhil; “you can go to the market where\r\nprovisions are sold. You can get dried meat and perhaps some millet\r\nthere, but you will have to pay a high price, for, as I have told you,\r\nthere is a famine in Omdurman.”\r\n\r\n“And during my absence wicked people might carry off the children or\r\nkill them.”\r\n\r\n“The soldiers will guard them; or if you give one of them some money he\r\nwill go and procure food for you.”\r\n\r\nThis was not very acceptable advice to Idris, who much preferred\r\naccepting money to giving it; but before he answered the boats had\r\nlanded.\r\n\r\nTo the children Omdurman looked quite different from Khartum, where\r\nthere were brick houses several stories high, the “Moodiria” (the palace\r\nof the governor, in which the heroic Gordon fell), a church, a hospital,\r\nmission-houses, an arsenal, many military garrisons, and a number of\r\nlarge and small gardens with the plentiful, luxuriant vegetation of the\r\nequatorial districts, whereas Omdurman looked more like a camp of\r\nsavages. The fortress, which stood on the northern side of the\r\nsettlement, had been destroyed by order of Gordon. As far as could be\r\nseen the town consisted only of round, ball-shaped huts of millet straw.\r\nNarrow hedges of thorns separated these little houses from one another\r\nand from the street. Only here and there were tents, which seemed to\r\nhave been captured from the Egyptians. In other places a few palm mats,\r\nunder a piece of dirty canvas stretched on bamboo rods, formed the\r\nentire dwelling. The inhabitants took refuge within their houses when it\r\nrained or when the heat was especially oppressive; but at other times\r\nthey lived in the open air, where they made their fires, cooked their\r\nfood, and lived and died. There was so much confusion in the streets\r\nthat in some places the party had the greatest difficulty in passing\r\nthrough the crowds. Omdurman had formerly been a wretched little\r\nvillage, but the population was now more than twenty thousand, including\r\nthe slaves. Even the Mahdi and his califs were alarmed that so many\r\npeople were threatened with hunger and sickness, and expeditions were\r\nconstantly sent northward to conquer the towns and districts that still\r\nremained loyal to the Egyptian Government.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the white children the multitude occasionally shouted in\r\na menacing manner, but did not threaten them with death as had the mob\r\nin Khartum. Perhaps the rabble did not dare do so in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the Mahdi, or they may have become accustomed to seeing\r\nprisoners, who had all been taken to Omdurman when Khartum had fallen.\r\nBut to Stasch and Nell it was a hell on earth. They beheld Europeans and\r\nEgyptians bleeding from whiplashings on their bare flesh, and all but\r\nstarved, used as beasts of burden and dying under their heavy loads.\r\nThey saw women and children of European birth, from homes of ease and\r\ncomfort—dressed in rags and lean as ghosts, whose white faces utter\r\nwretchedness had turned black—begging for a mouthful of dried meat or a\r\nhandful of maize, their starved, wild demeanor telling of terror and\r\ndespair. They noted how the savages scoffed when they saw these\r\nmiserable prisoners, and how they were pushed about and beaten. In every\r\nside street or little lane scenes were enacted from which the eyes\r\nturned away in horror and affright. In Omdurman a terrible epidemic of\r\ndysentery, typhoid, and smallpox prevailed. The sick, covered with\r\nsores, lay at the entrances of the huts, polluting the air. The\r\nprisoners were forced to drag through the streets the canvas-shrouded\r\ncorpses of those who had just died and inter them in the sand outside of\r\nthe town, where hyenas attended to the real burial. Over the town\r\nhovered flocks of vultures, whose lazy-flapping wings cast mournful\r\nshadows on the bright sand. When Stasch saw this he thought that the\r\nsooner he and Nell died the better it would be for them.\r\n\r\nBut even in this sea of misery and inhumanity deeds of kindly pity\r\noccasionally blossomed like tiny pale flowers rising from a foul swamp.\r\n\r\nIn Omdurman were a number of Greeks and Copts, whom the Mahdi had spared\r\nbecause he had use for them. These men went around not only unmolested,\r\nbut even carried on their different avocations, and some of them,\r\nespecially those who had made a pretense of changing their faith, had\r\nbecome officials of the prophet, which made them quite important in the\r\neyes of the wild Dervishes. One of these Greeks stopped the party and\r\nbegan to question the children, asking where they came from. When to his\r\ngreat surprise he heard that they had been carried off from Fayoum and\r\nhad only just arrived, he promised to tell the Mahdi about them and to\r\ninquire after them as soon as practicable. At the same time he bent his\r\nhead sorrowfully over Nell and gave each of the children a lot of wild\r\nfigs and a piece of money of Marie Therese coinage. He then warned the\r\nsoldiers against harming the girl in any way and went off, saying in\r\nEnglish, “Poor little bird!”\r\n\r\nAfter passing along very tortuous little streets they at last reached\r\nthe market-place, which stood in the middle of the town. On the way they\r\nsaw many people who had had a hand or foot amputated. These were thieves\r\nor evil-doers, who had secreted spoil. Terrible punishments were meted\r\nout by the califs and emirs to those who disobeyed the laws of the\r\nprophet, and even for small transgressions—such, for instance, as\r\nsmoking tobacco—the culprits were beaten until they lay bleeding and\r\nunconscious. But the califs themselves subscribed only outwardly to the\r\nrules of the prophet, while at home they did as they pleased, so that\r\nthese punishments fell only on the poor, whose goods and chattels they\r\nat the same time confiscated. There was nothing left for the miserable\r\npeople to do but to beg, and as there was great scarcity of food in\r\nOmdurman, they succumbed to hunger.\r\n\r\nTherefore there were crowds of beggars at the places where provisions\r\nwere sold. The first thing that attracted the attention of the children\r\nwas a head stuck on the end of a bamboo rod placed in the center of the\r\nround market-place. The face was shriveled and almost black, while the\r\nhair and beard were white as milk. One of the soldiers told Idris that\r\nthis was the head of Gordon. At this Stasch was overcome with grief,\r\nindignation, and a burning desire for revenge; yet he was so frightened\r\nthat the blood seemed to cease flowing in his veins. This was the fate\r\nof the hero, the fearless and blameless knight, the just and good man,\r\nwho was beloved even in Sudan. And the English, who had not come to his\r\nassistance in time, but had rather withdrawn their aid, now abandoned\r\nhis remains, exposed to ridicule, without giving them the honor of\r\nChristian burial. From that moment Stasch lost all faith in the English.\r\nUntil now he had naïvely believed that England, if the least wrong were\r\ndone to one of her countrymen, was always ready to challenge the whole\r\nworld. Until now in the depths of his soul there had always glimmered a\r\nray of hope that, the search proving unsuccessful, English troops would\r\nbe sent as far as Khartum, and even farther, to protect Mr. Rawlison’s\r\ndaughter. Now he knew but too well that Khartum and the whole country\r\nwas in the hands of the Mahdi, and that the Egyptian Government, and\r\nEngland, too, would think rather of protecting themselves from further\r\nattacks than of devising means for the release of European prisoners.\r\n\r\nHe realized that he and Nell had fallen into an abyss from which there\r\nwas no possible means of escape, and these thoughts, in addition to the\r\nhorrors he had witnessed in the streets of Omdurman, were the last\r\nstraw. His usual elasticity and energy were replaced by complete and\r\nirresistible submission to his fate and anxiety for the future. He gazed\r\naround almost languidly at the market-place and the stands, at which\r\nIdris was bargaining for food. Here the street merchants, chiefly\r\nSudanese women and negresses, sold Dschubis (white linen smocks with\r\ndifferent colored trimmings), acacia-rubber, hollowed-out bottle-gourds,\r\nglass beads, sulphur, and all kinds of mats. There were benches where\r\nprovisions were on sale, and around these a large crowd gathered. The\r\nMahdists bought at high prices chiefly pieces of dried meat of domestic\r\nanimals, buffaloes, antelopes, and giraffes. But there were absolutely\r\nno dates, figs, or maize. Once in a while they sold water mixed with the\r\nhoney of wild bees and millet seeds soaked in an infusion of tamarinds.\r\nIdris was in despair, for he saw that the market prices were so high\r\nthat he would soon spend all the money given him by Fatima for\r\nprovisions, and then he would be obliged to beg. His only hope now lay\r\nin Smain. Strangely enough, at this very moment Stasch, too, relied on\r\nSmain’s help.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Nur-el-Tadhil returned from the calif. Apparently\r\nsomething disagreeable had happened to him there, for he was in a very\r\nbad humor, and when Idris asked him whether he had heard anything about\r\nSmain, he answered him abruptly:\r\n\r\n“You fool, do you suppose that the calif and I have nothing better to do\r\nthan to find Smain for you?”\r\n\r\n“What do you intend me to do now?”\r\n\r\n“Do what you please. I have allowed you to spend the night in my house,\r\nand I have given you much good advice, and now I do not wish to hear\r\nfrom you again.”\r\n\r\n“All right; but where shall I find shelter for the night?”\r\n\r\n“That is no affair of mine.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he departed, taking the soldiers with him. Idris could\r\nhardly beg him to send the caravan and the Arabs who had joined them\r\nbetween Assuan and Wadi Halfa, to him in the market-place. These people\r\nhad only arrived at mid-day, and then it was evident that none of them\r\nknew what to do. The two Sudanese began to quarrel with Idris and Gebhr,\r\ndeclaring that they had imagined that they would have a very different\r\nreception, and that they had purposely been deceived. After lengthy\r\ndiscussions and consultations they decided to erect on the outskirts of\r\nthe town tents of fir branches and bamboo, in which to seek shelter for\r\nthe night, and then to wait and leave the rest to Providence.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished the tents, which did not take long to build, all\r\nthe Sudanese and negroes, except Chamis, who was to prepare the evening\r\nmeal, went off to the public place of prayer. It was easy to find, for\r\ncrowds from all sections of Omdurman were going there. The place was\r\nspacious, bordered by a hedge of thorns and partly by a clay wall, which\r\nhad just been commenced. In the center was a wooden platform, on which\r\nthe prophet stood while instructing the people. On the ground, in front\r\nof the tribune, sheepskins were spread out for the Mahdi, the calif, and\r\nthe more important sheiks. At the sides the flags of the Empire were\r\nhoisted. The banners fluttered in the wind and shone like large\r\nvariegated flowers. The four sides of the place were lined with crowded\r\nrows of Dervishes. All around could be seen towering forests of spears,\r\nwith which nearly all the warriors were armed.\r\n\r\nIt was lucky for Idris and Gebhr, as well as for the rest of the\r\ncaravan, that they were considered followers of one of the emirs, and\r\ntherefore could get in the front ranks of the crowd. The arrival of the\r\nMahdi was first announced by the far-reaching and solemn umbaja, and\r\nwhen he appeared sharp whistles, the beating of drums, the clattering of\r\nstones shaken in empty bottle-gourds, rang out, all combining in a most\r\ninfernal racket. The people were beside themselves with enthusiasm. Some\r\nfell on their knees, others cried out as loud as they could, “Oh, you\r\nare sent from God!” “Oh, victorious one!” “Oh, merciful one!” “Oh,\r\npitying one!” and kindred exclamations, that lasted until the Mahdi\r\nstepped into the pulpit. Then amid dead silence he raised his hands, put\r\nhis thumbs in his ears, and prayed for a while. The children stood quite\r\nnear and could see him very well. He was a man of middle age, singularly\r\ncorpulent and bloated, and nearly black. Stasch, who was an especially\r\nquick observer, noticed that his face was tattooed and that he wore a\r\nlarge ivory ring in one ear. He was dressed in a white coat and had a\r\nwhite cap on his head; his feet were bare, for before he mounted the\r\npulpit he had removed his red half-high shoes and left them on the\r\nsheepskins, where he was afterward going to pray. There was not the\r\nleast attempt at luxury in his dress, but occasionally the wind blew a\r\nstrong and pleasing odor of sandalwood[11] from him, which the believers\r\ngreedily sniffed up their noses, at the same time rolling their eyes\r\nwith delight. Stasch had imagined the terrible prophet, the robber and\r\nmurderer of so many thousands, to be quite a different looking person,\r\nand whilst gazing at this fat face with its mild expression and tearful\r\neyes, and with a smile constantly hovering about the lips, he could not\r\nconceal his surprise. He thought that such a man would have the head of\r\na hyena or a crocodile, but instead he saw before him a fat-cheeked\r\ngourd with a face like a full moon.\r\n\r\nThe prophet began his teaching. His deep and ringing voice could be\r\nheard over all the place, so that every word reached the ears of the\r\nbelievers. He now spoke of the punishments inflicted by God on those who\r\ndo not follow the laws of the Mahdi, but instead conceal spoil, get\r\ndrunk, steal, spare the enemy in war, and smoke tobacco. These crimes,\r\nhe said, would result in Allah’s sending down upon such sinners hunger\r\nand that sickness which honeycombs the face.[12] This earthly life is\r\nlike a vessel with a hole in it. Riches and pleasures sink in the sand.\r\nTrue belief is like a cow that gives sweet milk. But Paradise is open to\r\nthe victor only. Those who conquer the enemy will gain salvation. Those\r\nwho die for the faith will live forever and ever. Happy, a hundred times\r\nhappy, are those who have already fallen——\r\n\r\n“We will die for the faith!” cried the people in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nSoon after the infernal noise began again. Trumpets and drums resounded.\r\nThe warriors beat sword against sword and spear against spear. The\r\nwarlike enthusiasm seized every one like a flame. Some cried out, “The\r\nfaith is victory!” Others, “By death to Paradise!” Then Stasch\r\nunderstood why the Egyptian soldiers could not resist these wild tribes.\r\n\r\nWhen quiet was somewhat restored the prophet began to speak again. He\r\ntold of the visions he frequently had and about the mission he had\r\nreceived from God. Allah had commanded him to purify the faith and to\r\nspread it over the whole world. And he said that any one not recognizing\r\nhim as the Mahdi, the saviour, would be condemned to destruction. The\r\nend of the world is near, but before it comes it is the duty of the\r\nbelievers to conquer Egypt, Mecca, and all the lands on the other side\r\nof the sea, where the heathen dwell. That is the will of God, and\r\nnothing can change it. Much blood will still be shed, many warriors will\r\nnot return to their wives and children in their tents, but no human\r\ntongue can portray the happiness of those who fall in the cause.\r\n\r\nThen he stretched out his hands toward the assembled multitude, and\r\nclosing, said:\r\n\r\n“I, the saviour, and servant of God, bless the holy war and you\r\nwarriors. I bless your fatigue, your wounds, your death. I bless the\r\nvictory, and mourn for you as a father who loves you.”\r\n\r\nHe burst into tears. When he left the pulpit screams and wailing rent\r\nthe air. Every one wept. The two califs, Abdullah and Ali-uled-Helu,\r\ngave their arms to the Mahdi to support him, and led him to the\r\nsheepskin, on which he knelt. During this short moment Idris feverishly\r\nasked Stasch whether Smain was not among the emirs.\r\n\r\n“No!” replied the boy, who with his sharp eyes had searched in vain for\r\nthe well-known face. “I can not see him anywhere. Perhaps he fell in the\r\nattack on Khartum.”\r\n\r\nNor could Chamis, who had known Smain in Port Said, find him. The\r\nprayers lasted a long while. The Mahdi moved his hands and legs like a\r\ncircus-clown, then raised his eyes in ecstasy, while repeating: “There\r\nis God! There he is!” And as the sun was about to set he arose and\r\nwalked homeward.\r\n\r\nThe children now saw with what reverence the Dervishes surrounded their\r\nprophet, for crowds followed his footsteps and scraped up the earth on\r\nwhich he had trodden. This led to quarrels and fights, for the people\r\nbelieved that this earth would secure health to the well and also cure\r\nthe sick. Gradually the crowd left the place of prayer. Idris did not\r\nknow what was best to do, and he had just decided to return to the tents\r\nfor the night with the children and all the baggage, when the same Greek\r\nwho had given Stasch and Nell the dates and coin that morning stood\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n“I have spoken to the Mahdi about you,” he said in Arabic, “and the\r\nprophet wishes to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks to Allah and to you, sir!” cried Idris. “Shall we find Smain\r\nagain by the Mahdi’s side?”\r\n\r\n“Smain is in Fashoda,” answered the Greek. Then he said to Stasch in\r\nEnglish:\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the prophet will take you under his protection, for I have done\r\nmy best to get him to do so. I told him that the fame of his mercy would\r\nspread abroad throughout all the white nations. Terrible things are\r\nhappening all around us, and unless you are under his protection you\r\nwill surely succumb to hunger, privation, and sickness from the\r\ntreatment you will receive at the hands of these madmen. But he must be\r\nkept interested in you.”\r\n\r\n“What shall I do, sir?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“When you first come into his presence, fall on your knees, and when he\r\ngives you his hand, kiss it respectfully and beseech him to take you\r\nboth under his protecting wing.”\r\n\r\nHere the Greek stopped and asked:\r\n\r\n“Do none of these people understand English?”\r\n\r\n“No. Chamis has remained in the tent, and Idris and Gebhr only\r\nunderstand a few words, and the others not a word.”\r\n\r\n“That’s well. Listen to what I say, for everything must be planned in\r\nadvance. The Mahdi will ask you whether you are prepared to accept his\r\nfaith. Immediately answer that you are prepared, and that his presence\r\nhad from the first shed a peculiar light of grace upon you. Remember, a\r\npeculiar light of grace! That will flatter him and he will include you\r\namong his personal servants. Then you will have luxuries and every\r\ncomfort, which will prevent you from becoming ill. But if you act\r\ndifferently you will endanger yourself and this poor little thing, and\r\nalso me, the one who wishes you well. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\nStasch clenched his teeth and made no answer, but his face became rigid\r\nand his eyes had a strange light in them. The Greek, noticing this,\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n“My boy, I know that this is a disagreeable matter, but there is nothing\r\nelse to be done! All those who were spared after the bloody massacre in\r\nKhartum have accepted the faith of the Mahdi. The Catholic missionaries\r\nand nuns did not accept it, but that is a different matter. The Koran\r\nforbids the murdering of priests, and although their fate is terrible\r\nenough, yet at least they are not threatened with death. But for people\r\nof other classes that was the only means of escape. I repeat, every one\r\naccepted Mohammedanism—the Germans, Italians, Copts, English,\r\nGreeks—even I myself.”\r\n\r\nAnd although Stasch had assured him that not one in the caravan\r\nunderstood English, his voice sank to a whisper:\r\n\r\n“I do not need to tell you that this step does not mean a denial of the\r\nFaith or treason or apostasy. In his soul each one remains what he was\r\nbefore, and God knows this. One must bend to power, if only apparently.\r\nIt is a man’s duty to defend his life, and it would be madness, yes,\r\neven sin, to endanger it—and for what reason? For the mere sake of\r\nappearances, for the sake of a few words spoken, which even when you\r\nutter them you can inwardly deny. Besides, remember in your hands lies\r\nnot only your own life, but also the life of your little companion,\r\nwhose fate you have no right to decide. I assure you that when the time\r\ncomes for God to deliver you from the hands of these people, you will\r\nhave nothing with which to reproach yourself, and no one will reproach\r\nyou—no more than any of us——”\r\n\r\nWhile the Greek talked to the boy in this way, perhaps he deceived his\r\nown conscience, but Stasch’s silence also deceived him, for he at last\r\nmistook it for fear. So he tried to encourage the boy.\r\n\r\n“These are the houses of the Mahdi,” he said. “He prefers staying in\r\nthese wooden huts here in Omdurman rather than to live in Khartum,\r\nalthough he could have taken possession of Gordon’s palace. Keep up your\r\ncourage! Don’t lose your head! Answer all questions promptly and with\r\ndecision. Here they admire every form of courage. Don’t imagine that the\r\nMahdi will roar at you like a lion. No! He always smiles—even when he\r\ndoes not contemplate any good deeds.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke these words he called to the crowd standing before the house\r\nto make room for the “guests” of the prophet.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\nZizyphus Spina Christi, a spiny and usually small shrub, sometimes\r\ncalled the jujube-tree.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\nThe Mahdi’s brothers and relatives.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\nA large trumpet made of an elephant’s tusk.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\nIn the Orient they prepare a scented oil from sandalwood.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\nThe smallpox.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the room they saw the Mahdi lying on a soft couch,\r\nsurrounded by his wives, two of whom were fanning him with large ostrich\r\nfeathers. No one else was with him except Calif Abdullah and Calif\r\nSherif; for the third calif, Ali-uled-Helu, was at this time forwarding\r\nsoldiers to the north, to Barbary, and to Abu Hammed, places already\r\ncaptured by the Dervishes. When the prophet saw the newcomers he pushed\r\naside the women and sat up on the couch. Idris, Gebhr, and the two\r\nBedouins fell on their faces and then knelt with their hands on their\r\nchests.\r\n\r\nThe Greek made a sign to Stasch to do the same, but the boy pretended\r\nnot to see this; he merely bowed, and remained standing. His face had\r\nbecome pale, but his eyes shone brightly, and from his whole\r\nappearance—the proud way he held up his head and his compressed\r\nlips—it could readily be seen that something was uppermost in his mind,\r\nthat he was no longer undecided and frightened, but that he had made a\r\nfirm resolution, which nothing in the world could tempt him to break.\r\nThe Greek seemed to comprehend the situation, for his face wore a very\r\nanxious expression. The Mahdi took in both children at a quick glance,\r\nand his fat face lighted up with its customary smile; then turning to\r\nIdris and to Gebhr, he asked:\r\n\r\n“You have come from the far north?”\r\n\r\nIdris touched the floor with his forehead.\r\n\r\n“It is so, oh Madhi! We belong to the Dangali tribe, and therefore we\r\nhave left our homes in Fayoum in order to come and kneel down before\r\nyour blessed feet.”\r\n\r\n“I saw you in the desert. It is a terrible road, but I sent an angel,\r\nwho watched over you and protected you from death at the hands of\r\nunbelievers. You did not see him, but he was there watching over you.”\r\n\r\n“We thank thee, saviour.”\r\n\r\n“And so you have brought the children for Smain, to enable him to\r\nexchange them for his own offspring, whom the Turks are detaining\r\ntogether with Fatima in Port Said.”\r\n\r\n“You only will we serve!”\r\n\r\n“He who serves me works out his own salvation, and thereby you open the\r\nway to Paradise for yourselves. Fatima is my relative. But let me tell\r\nyou that when I conquer the whole of Egypt, then my relatives and their\r\nsuccessors will obtain their freedom.”\r\n\r\n“Then, oh blessed one, do what you wish with the children!”\r\n\r\nThe Mahdi half closed his eyelids, opened them again, smiled\r\ngood-naturedly, and beckoned to Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Come nearer, boy!”\r\n\r\nStasch advanced with an energetic, soldier-like step, bowed for the\r\nsecond time, then straightened up stiff as the string of a bow and\r\nwaited, looking directly into the eyes of the Mahdi.\r\n\r\n“Peace be with you! Are you pleased to come to us?”\r\n\r\n“No, prophet! We were carried away from our fathers against our wills.”\r\n\r\nThis frank answer created a sensation not only for the ruler, who was\r\naccustomed to being flattered, but on the others present as well. Calif\r\nAbdullah frowned, the Greek bit his lips and began to twist his fingers;\r\nbut the Mahdi never ceased smiling.\r\n\r\n“But,” he said, “on the other hand, you are now at the fountain of\r\ntruth. Will you drink at this source?”\r\n\r\nA short silence ensued, and the Mahdi, thinking that the boy had not\r\nunderstood the question, repeated it more plainly.\r\n\r\n“Will you accept my teaching?”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Stasch, with the hand that he held to his breast, without\r\nattracting attention, managed to make the sign of the cross, just as\r\nthough he were going to spring from a sinking ship into deep water.\r\n\r\n“Prophet,” he said, “I am not familiar with your teaching, so if I were\r\nto accept it I should do so only from fear, like cowards and base\r\npersons, and do you wish cowards and base persons to accept your faith?”\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking he continued to look the Mahdi unflinchingly in\r\nthe eye. The silence that ensued was so great that the buzzing of the\r\nbees could be heard. Besides this, something very unusual happened. The\r\nMahdi was embarrassed for a moment and could not think what reply to\r\nmake. Stretching out his hand, he grasped a bottle-gourd filled with\r\nwater and honey and began to drink, but evidently only to gain time and\r\nto hide his embarrassment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  “The brave boy, a true descendant of the defenders of\r\nChristianity, stood with his head erect awaiting his sentence.” ]\r\n\r\nAnd the brave boy, a true descendant of the defenders of Christianity,\r\nstood with his head erect awaiting his sentence. On his sunken cheek,\r\ntanned by the desert wind, there was now a tinge of pink, his eyes shone\r\nbrightly, and a thrill of exaltation passed through his delicate body.\r\n“Every one,” he thought, “has accepted his teaching, but I have neither\r\nrenounced my Faith nor sacrificed my soul.” And the fear of what might\r\nhappen and would happen remained buried in his breast, and he was filled\r\nwith joy and pride. Then the Mahdi, putting down the bottle-gourd,\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n“So you refuse to accept my teaching?”\r\n\r\n“I am what my father is—a Christian!”\r\n\r\n“Whosoever closes his ears to the heavenly voice,” said the Mahdi\r\nslowly, and in a changed tone of voice, “is nothing more than wood, to\r\nbe cast into the fire.”\r\n\r\nCalif Abdullah, who was known for his severity and cruelty, showed his\r\nwhite teeth like a wild animal and said:\r\n\r\n“This boy’s answers are rude; therefore, sir, punish him, or permit me\r\nto do so.”\r\n\r\n“All is over,” thought Stasch to himself.\r\n\r\nBut the Mahdi, who was always desirous that the fame of his mercy might\r\nspread not only among the Dervishes, but throughout the whole world,\r\nthought that too severe a sentence, especially against a small boy,\r\nmight be bad for his reputation. For a while he passed the glass beads\r\nof the rosary between his fingers, and then said:\r\n\r\n“No; these children were carried off on Smain’s account; therefore,\r\nthough I have nothing to do with unbelievers, they must be sent to\r\nSmain. This is my wish!”\r\n\r\n“It shall be done,” answered the Calif.\r\n\r\nThen the Mahdi pointed to Idris, Gebhr, and the Bedouins.\r\n\r\n“These people, O Abdullah, you must reward in my name, for they have\r\ncompleted a long and dangerous journey in order to serve God and\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nThen he nodded as a sign that the audience was at an end, and in like\r\nmanner he ordered the Greek to leave him. When the latter reached the\r\nplace of prayer, which was now dark, he took hold of Stasch by the arm\r\nand vented his rage and despair by shaking him.\r\n\r\n“Cursed one! You have endangered the life of this innocent child,” he\r\nsaid, pointing to Nell. “You have ruined yourself and perhaps Nell,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“I could not act otherwise,” answered Stasch.\r\n\r\n“You could not! Remember that you are about to take a second journey,\r\nwhich will be a hundred times worse than the first. It means death— Do\r\nyou understand? In Fashoda the fever will be the end of you in a week’s\r\ntime. The Mahdi knows why he is sending you to Smain.”\r\n\r\n“We might also have died had we remained in Omdurman.”\r\n\r\n“That is not so! If you had lived in the Mahdi’s house, in prosperity\r\nand in comfort, you would not have died. And he was prepared to take you\r\nunder his wing. I know that he intended to do so. But you have shown how\r\nungrateful you are to me for having interested myself in you! Now you\r\ncan do what you please! In a week Abdullah will send the camel-post to\r\nFashoda, and during this week you can do what you please! You will never\r\nsee me again.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he went away, but soon returned. He was talkative, as\r\nall Greeks are, and felt the necessity of giving vent to his opinions.\r\nHe was thoroughly angry, and wanted to fire his rage at Stasch’s head.\r\nHe was not cruel, nor had he a bad heart, but he wanted the boy to\r\nrealize the terrible responsibility he had incurred by not profiting by\r\nhis warning and advice.\r\n\r\n“Who would have prevented you from being a Christian at heart?” he said.\r\n“Do you think I am not a Christian? But I am no fool. You have preferred\r\nto make a display of false courage. Up to this time I have been able to\r\nbe of great service to the white prisoners, but henceforth I can not do\r\nanything for them, because the Mahdi is angry with me, too. They all\r\nwill perish! And your little companion in suffering will surely die! You\r\nhave killed her! In Fashoda even grown people succumb like flies to the\r\nfever, and how can such a child escape? When you are forced to walk\r\nalongside of the horses and camels, she will die the very first day. And\r\nyou will be to blame for it. You ought to be happy now, you\r\nChristian!——”\r\n\r\nHe walked away, and they turned off from the place of prayer and went\r\nthrough narrow, dark lanes toward the tents. They walked a long time,\r\nfor the town was very large. Nell, who was greatly overcome by fatigue,\r\nhunger, fear, and the terrible sensations she had experienced all day,\r\nstopped to rest; but Idris and Gebhr pushed her ahead faster. After a\r\nwhile, however, her feet absolutely refused to move a step farther. Then\r\nStasch, without thinking much about it, picked her up in his arms and\r\ncarried her. On the way he wanted to speak to her, wanted to justify\r\nhimself by telling her that he could not have acted otherwise than he\r\nhad, but his mind was a blank and he could only repeat over and over\r\nagain: “Nell! Nell! Nell!” and pressed her to him, unable to say another\r\nword. After they had gone a short distance Nell was so tired that she\r\nfell asleep in his arms, and so he walked silently through the quiet of\r\nthe sleepy little streets, that were disturbed only by the conversation\r\nof Idris and Gebhr.\r\n\r\nTheir hearts were happy, which was lucky for Stasch, for otherwise they\r\nmight have wanted to punish him again for having answered the Mahdi so\r\nrudely. But they were so absorbed with what had happened to them that\r\nthey were quite unable to think of anything else.\r\n\r\n“I felt ill,” said Idris, “but the sight of the prophet made me well\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“He is like a palm in the desert and cold water on a warm day, and his\r\nwords are like ripe dates,” answered Gebhr.\r\n\r\n“Nur-el-Tadhil lied when he told us that the Mahdi would not admit us to\r\nhis presence. He did admit us, and he blessed us, and told Abdullah to\r\nreward us.”\r\n\r\n“He will certainly reward us well, for the will of the Mahdi is sacred.”\r\n\r\n“Bismillah! May it be as you say,” said one of the Bedouins.\r\n\r\nAnd Gebhr began to dream of innumerable camels, horned cattle, horses,\r\nand sacks filled with piasters. Idris awakened him from his dreams by\r\npointing to Stasch, who was carrying the sleeping Nell, and asked:\r\n\r\n“And what are we to do with that wasp and this fly?”\r\n\r\n“Ha! Smain must give us an extra reward for them.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry they did not fall into the hands of the Calif, who would\r\nhave taught this young dog what it means to bark at the truth and the\r\nchosen one of God.”\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi is merciful,” answered Idris, and then after a while he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n“Still, it is certain that if Smain has them both in his hands, neither\r\nthe Turks nor the English will kill his children and Fatima.”\r\n\r\n“Then perhaps he will reward us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. So Abdullah’s post is to take them to Fashoda, and a heavy load\r\nwill be off our shoulders. And when Smain returns here we will demand a\r\nreward from him.”\r\n\r\n“So you think we should remain in Omdurman?”\r\n\r\n“Allah! Have you not had enough traveling in that journey from Fayoum to\r\nKhartum? It is quite time to take a rest!”\r\n\r\nThe tents were now close by, but Stasch walked more slowly, for his\r\nstrength was becoming exhausted. Even though Nell was light, he felt her\r\nweight more and more. The Sudanese, who were impatient to lie down and\r\nsleep, shouted at him to hurry up, and at last they pushed him along by\r\nstriking him on the head with their fists.\r\n\r\nThe boy bore everything in silence, his one thought being always to\r\nprotect his little sister, and it was only when one of the Bedouins gave\r\nhim a blow that nearly knocked him down that he said through his\r\nclenched teeth:\r\n\r\n“We shall reach Fashoda alive!”\r\n\r\nThis kept the Arabs from doing further violence, for they were afraid to\r\ndisobey the commands of the prophet. But they were even more affected by\r\nthe fact that Idris was suddenly seized with such a severe attack of\r\ndizziness that he had to lean on Gebhr’s arm, and although the pain\r\nceased after a while, the Sudanese became alarmed and said:\r\n\r\n“Allah! Something must be the matter with me! Have I been seized with\r\nsome illness?”\r\n\r\n“You have seen the Mahdi, and therefore you will not be ill,” answered\r\nGebhr.\r\n\r\nThey finally reached the barracks, and summoning all his strength,\r\nStasch put the sleeping Nell in the care of old Dinah, who, though\r\nindisposed herself, nevertheless prepared a very comfortable\r\nresting-place for her little lady. After the Sudanese and the Bedouins\r\nhad swallowed a piece of raw meat, they threw themselves down as heavy\r\nas logs on the cloth rugs. Stasch was given nothing to eat, but Dinah\r\npushed a handful of soaked maize toward him, a small quantity of which\r\nshe had stolen from the camels. But he was neither sleepy nor hungry.\r\n\r\nThe burden that rested on his shoulders was really more than heavy. He\r\nfelt that he had done right, and even if he forfeited the good will of\r\nthe Mahdi, which one could purchase by denying one’s faith, he knew his\r\nfather would be very proud of his decision, and that it would make him\r\nvery happy, but at the same time he thought that he had endangered the\r\nlife of Nell, his companion in misfortune and his beloved sister, for\r\nwhom he would willingly have given the last drop of his blood.\r\n\r\nAnd so when every one was asleep he sobbed as if his heart would break,\r\nand lay on the piece of cloth rug weeping for a long time like a child,\r\nwhich, after all, he still was.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nThe visit to the Mahdi and his talk with him had evidently not brought\r\nhealth to Idris, for during that very night he fell seriously ill, and\r\nin the morning became unconscious. Chamis, Gebhr, and the Bedouins were\r\nsent for to appear before the calif, who detained them several hours and\r\npraised them for their courage. But they returned in a very bad temper\r\nand were exceedingly angry, for they had expected heaven knows what kind\r\nof reward, and now Abdullah had awarded them only an Egyptian pound[13]\r\nand a horse. The Bedouins began to quarrel with Gebhr, and they nearly\r\ncame to blows, but finally decided that they would ride along to Fashoda\r\nwith the camel-post, so as to demand payment from Smain. Chamis, in the\r\nhope that Smain’s protection would be more advantageous to him than\r\nstaying in Omdurman, accompanied them.\r\n\r\nAnd then there began a week of hunger and privation for the children,\r\nfor Gebhr never even thought of supplying them with food. Happily Stasch\r\nstill had two Maria Theresa thalers,[14] that he had received from the\r\nGreek, and so he went to the town to buy dates and rice. The Sudanese\r\nhad nothing to say against this, for they knew that he could not escape\r\nfrom Omdurman, and that he would on no account leave the little “Biut.”\r\nBut the walk was not without incident, for the sight of the boy in\r\nEuropean clothing buying provisions in the market-place attracted a\r\ncrowd of half-savage Dervishes, who greeted him with laughter and howls.\r\nLuckily many of them had seen him the day before when he was with the\r\nMahdi, and so they restrained the others, who wanted to attack him. The\r\nchildren, however, threw stones and sand at him, but he paid no\r\nattention to them.\r\n\r\nPrices in the market were exceedingly high, so he could not get dates,\r\nand Gebhr took most of the rice away to give to his sick brother. The\r\nboy resisted this with all his strength, which resulted in a scuffle,\r\nfrom which naturally the weaker one emerged bumped and bruised. Chamis’\r\ncruelty now first became evident. He only showed an attachment to Saba,\r\nand fed him with raw meat, but he viewed with the greatest indifference\r\nthe needs of the children, whom he had known for some time, and who had\r\nalways been kind to him; and when Stasch turned to him, begging him to\r\ngive Nell something to eat, he answered laughingly:\r\n\r\n“Go and beg.”\r\n\r\nFinally things came to such a pass the next day that Stasch really had\r\nto beg to save Nell from suffering from hunger. His efforts were not\r\naltogether futile. Many times a former soldier, an officer of the\r\nKhedive of Egypt, gave him a few piasters or a handful of dried figs,\r\nand told him he would help him the following day. Once he met a\r\nmissionary and a Sister of Charity, who wept on hearing the tale of the\r\nchildren’s fate, and although they themselves were exhausted from\r\nhunger, they shared what they had with him. They also promised to visit\r\nthem in the barracks, and the following day actually came, in the hope\r\nthat they might succeed in being permitted to take the children along\r\nwith them until the departure of the post. But Gebhr and Chamis drove\r\nthem away with scourges.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Stasch met them again, and they gave him a little\r\nrice and two small quinine powders, of which the missionary told him to\r\nbe especially careful, in case they should get the fever in Fashoda.\r\n\r\n“You are now going,” he said, “to ride along the banks of the White\r\nNile, which has overflowed, or straight through the so-called Suddis. As\r\nthe river can not flow freely on account of the obstacles in its path,\r\nthe plants and leaves which the current carries along pile up in the\r\nshallow places, where they form large, infectious puddles. There the\r\nfever does not spare even the negroes. Take special care not to sleep on\r\nthe bare ground at night without a fire.”\r\n\r\n“Would we had died!” Stasch answered, half sighing.\r\n\r\nNow the missionary, raising his wan face toward heaven, prayed a while,\r\nand making the sign of the cross on the boy, said:\r\n\r\n“Put your faith in God! You have not denied Him, and His mercy and\r\nprotection will be over you.”\r\n\r\nStasch not only attempted to beg, but also tried to get work. One day\r\nwhen he saw crowds working in the place of prayer, he went over to them\r\nand began to carry clay to the wall which was being built around the\r\nplace. It is true that he was laughed at and pushed about, but in the\r\nevening the old sheik, the overseer, gave him twelve dates. Stasch was\r\nvery much pleased with this reward, for after rice dates were the only\r\nfood that was good for Nell, and it was becoming more and more difficult\r\nto find them in Omdurman.\r\n\r\nSo he proudly presented the dozen dates to his little sister, to whom he\r\nbrought everything he could find. During the last few days he had lived\r\nmostly on maize that he had stolen from the camels. Nell was delighted\r\nwhen she saw her favorite fruit, but she wanted Stasch to share them\r\nwith her. Standing on tip-toe, she put her arms around his neck, and\r\nraising her little head, looked in his eyes and begged:\r\n\r\n“Stasch! Eat half of them! Eat them!”\r\n\r\nBut he answered:\r\n\r\n“I have already eaten. I have already eaten. Oh, I have had a great\r\nplenty!”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, but soon after bit his lips to prevent bursting into tears,\r\nfor he was really all but starved. He resolved to go out the next day in\r\nsearch of work. But things happened that changed his plans. Early in the\r\nmorning a messenger came by order of Abdullah to announce that the\r\ncamel-post would depart for Fashoda during the night, and he brought an\r\norder from the calif stating that Idris, Gebhr, Chamis, and the two\r\nBedouins should have themselves and the children in readiness for the\r\njourney. This order astonished and annoyed Gebhr, and he declared that\r\nhe would not ride because his brother was ill, and there was no one to\r\ntake care of him, and that even if he were well they had decided to\r\nremain in Omdurman.\r\n\r\nBut the messenger answered:\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi never changes his mind, and Abdullah, his calif and my\r\nmaster, never changes his orders. A slave can take care of your brother,\r\nbut you will ride with the others to Fashoda.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will go to the calif and tell him that I will not ride.”\r\n\r\n“Only those gain admittance to the calif whom he wishes to see, and if\r\nyou try to force your way in without permission you will be led out to\r\nthe gallows.”\r\n\r\n“Allah Akbar! Then tell me plainly that I am a slave.”\r\n\r\n“Be quiet and obey orders!” answered the messenger.\r\n\r\nThe Sudanese had seen the gallows in Omdurman almost broken down from\r\nthe weight of those hanged on them, and that after the cruel Abdullah\r\nhad pronounced sentence new bodies were strung up daily, so he was\r\nafraid. What the messenger had told him about the Mahdi never changing\r\nhis mind and Abdullah never changing his orders was confirmed by all the\r\nDervishes. Therefore there was no way of escape, and they would have to\r\nride.\r\n\r\n“I shall never see Idris again,” thought Gebhr. In his tiger-like heart\r\nthere was still a feeling of affection for his elder brother, and the\r\nthought of leaving him behind ill filled him with despair. It was in\r\nvain that Chamis and the Bedouins explained to him that perhaps they\r\nwould be better off in Fashoda than in Omdurman, and that Smain would\r\nprobably not give them any larger reward than the calif had done. But\r\nnothing they could say was able to dispel Gebhr’s sadness or appease his\r\nanger, which of course he vented chiefly on Stasch.\r\n\r\nFor the boy this was a day of real martyrdom. He was not allowed to go\r\nto the market-place, and so he could neither earn nor beg anything, and\r\nhe was made to work like a slave at the baggage, which was being made\r\nready for the journey, and this was all the more difficult because he\r\nwas very weak from hunger and fatigue. He was just about ready to die on\r\nthe way, either from Gebhr’s scourge or from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nFortunately, toward evening the Greek appeared. As we have already said,\r\nhe had a good heart, and notwithstanding all that had taken place, he\r\ncame to see the children, to take leave of them, and to give them the\r\nmost necessary things for the journey. He brought them several little\r\nquinine powders and some glass beads and provisions. On hearing that\r\nIdris was ill, he turned towards Gebhr, Chamis, and the Bedouins and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“I have come by order of the Mahdi.”\r\n\r\nWhen they bowed low on hearing these words, he continued:\r\n\r\n“You are to supply the children with food on the way and are to treat\r\nthem well. They are to tell Smain how you have treated them, and Smain\r\nwill report it to the prophet. If there be any complaint about you, the\r\nfollowing post will bring you your death warrant.”\r\n\r\nA second bow was the only answer to these words, whereupon Gebhr and\r\nChamis made faces like dogs that are being muzzled.\r\n\r\nThe Greek told them to go away; then he added in English as he turned\r\ntoward the children:\r\n\r\n“I invented all this, for the Mahdi gave no further orders concerning\r\nyou. But as he said that you were to ride to Fashoda, you must naturally\r\nreach there alive. Besides, I calculate that none of these people will\r\nsee the Mahdi or the calif before they start on this journey.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Stasch and continued:\r\n\r\n“Boy, I had a grudge against you, and I still have it. Do you know that\r\nyou nearly caused my ruin? The Mahdi was angry with me, and to appease\r\nhim I had to give up a considerable part of my fortune to Abdullah, and\r\nI am not quite sure yet whether I am safe for only a while or for\r\nalways. At any rate, hereafter I shall not be able to assist the\r\nprisoners as I have done. But I am sorry for you, and especially for\r\nthis girl here. I have a daughter about her age, whom I love more than\r\nmy own life. All that I have done I did on her account. Christ will bear\r\nme witness to that. She still wears a silver cross under her dress, next\r\nher heart. Her name is the same as yours, my little one. If it were not\r\nfor her I should prefer to die rather than to live in this hell.”\r\n\r\nHe was overcome by emotion, and remained silent for a while, then he\r\npassed his hand over his forehead and began to talk of something else.\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi is sending you to Fashoda, secretly hoping that you will die\r\nthere. This is his means of taking revenge on you—especially on account\r\nof your resistance, boy, which wounded him deeply—without endangering\r\nhis name, ‘the merciful one.’ He is always like that. But who can tell\r\nwhich will die first! Abdullah suggested the idea of ordering these\r\ndogs, who carried you off, to ride along with you. He rewarded them very\r\nmeagerly, and is afraid this may become known. Besides, he and the\r\nprophet do not want these people to spread the news that there are still\r\nsoldiers, cannon, money, and the English in Egypt. But it will be a hard\r\njourney and a long one. You will pass through a desolate and unhealthy\r\nland, and these powders will protect you.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, tell Gebhr once more not to dare let Nell starve nor to beat her,”\r\nbegged Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Fear nothing. I have spoken about you to the old sheik who drives the\r\npost. He is an old acquaintance of mine, and I have given him a watch,\r\nand this insured his protection for you.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he prepared to leave them. Taking Nell in his arms, he\r\npressed her to his heart and whispered:\r\n\r\n“God bless you, my child!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun had gone down and it was starlight. Through the\r\ndarkness could be heard the neighing of the horses and the panting of\r\nthe heavily laden camels.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\nAbout four dollars and seventy-five cents.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\nAbout two dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nThe old sheik, Hatim, faithfully kept the promise he had made to the\r\nGreek, and carefully protected the children. The road to the upper White\r\nNile was a difficult one. They rode through Getena, El-Dueim, and Kawa;\r\nthen they passed Abba, a wooded island in the Nile, on which, before the\r\nMahdi’s war, a Dervish had lived in a hollow tree the life of a hermit.\r\nThe caravan had to go around wide tracts of land covered with papyrus\r\nand swamps called “Suddis,” from which the wind blew a stench caused by\r\nrotted and decaying leaves that had accumulated around obstructions in\r\nthe river. The English engineers had once removed these obstructions,\r\nand at one time steamers could go from Khartum to Fashoda, and even\r\nfarther up.[15] But now the river was clogged up again, and as it could\r\nnot flow freely, it overflowed both banks. The districts on the right\r\nand left banks were covered with a high jungle, from the midst of which\r\nheaps of ant-hills and isolated giant trees towered. In some places the\r\nwoods extended to the stream. In dry places grew large groves of\r\nacacias.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few weeks they still passed Arab settlements and small\r\ntowns, consisting of houses with peculiar, ball-shaped roofs of straw,\r\nbut on the other side of Abba, behind the settlement Gos-Abu-Guma, when\r\nthey came to the land of the blacks, they found it quite deserted, for\r\nthe Dervishes had carried off nearly all the natives and sold them in\r\nthe slave-markets of Khartum, Omdurman, and other places. Those who\r\nescaped capture by hiding in the thickets and in the woods died of\r\nhunger and smallpox, which was unusually prevalent along the White and\r\nBlue Nile. The Dervishes themselves said that “entire nations” had died\r\nof it. Places that were formerly sorghum and banana plantations were now\r\ncovered with jungle. Only wild animals multiplied, because there was no\r\none to hunt them. Sometimes about sunset the children saw in the\r\ndistance herds of elephants, that looked like moving rocks, slowly\r\nwalking to their watering-place. As soon as Hatim, who was formerly an\r\nivory-trader, caught sight of them he smacked his lips, sighed, and said\r\nconfidentially to Stasch:\r\n\r\n“Maschallah! How valuable they are! But they are not worth while hunting\r\nnow, for the Mahdi has forbidden the Egyptian merchants to come to\r\nKhartum; so there is no one except the emirs to buy elephant tusks.”\r\n\r\nBesides seeing elephants, they also came across giraffes, which ran off,\r\ntreading heavily and swaying their long necks, as though they were lame.\r\nBehind Gos-Abu-Guma buffaloes and herds of antelope appeared more\r\nfrequently. When the caravan was short of meat the men hunted them, but\r\nnearly always without success, for these animals are too watchful and\r\nfleet to be outwitted or cornered.\r\n\r\nUsually the food was meted out somewhat sparingly, for in consequence of\r\nthe land having been depopulated, one could not buy millet, bananas or\r\nfish, which the negroes of the Schilluk and the Dinka tribes used to\r\nsell to caravans in exchange for glass beads and copper wire.\r\n\r\nHatim saw that the children did not starve, though he kept Gebhr on\r\nshort rations, and once, when they had halted for the night and were\r\ntaking the saddles off the camels, Gebhr struck Stasch, and Hatim\r\nordered him to be laid on the ground, and gave him thirty blows with a\r\nbamboo rod on the sole of each foot. For two days the cruel Sudanese\r\ncould only walk on his toes, and he revenged himself on a young slave\r\nnamed Kali who had been given him.\r\n\r\nAt first Stasch felt almost glad that they had left the infected\r\nOmdurman and that he was now passing through countries which he had\r\nalways longed to see. His strong constitution had, up to this time,\r\nwithstood the fatigue of the journey quite well, and having plenty to\r\neat, he regained his lost energy. On the march, and also during the\r\nhalts for rest, he would again whisper to his little sister that it was\r\npossible to escape by way of the White Nile, and that he had by no means\r\ngiven up this idea. But he was worried about her health. Three weeks had\r\nnow passed since they had left Omdurman. Nell had not been stricken with\r\nthe fever as yet, but her face had become thin, and instead of getting\r\ntanned it had become more and more transparent, and her little hands had\r\na waxen look. Stasch and Dinah, with the assistance of Hatim, saw that\r\nshe was well cared for and that she had every comfort, but she missed\r\nthe health-giving desert air. The damp, hot climate, together with the\r\nfatigue of the journey, sapped still more the strength of the delicate\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Gos-Abu-Guma Stasch began giving her half a small\r\nquinine powder daily, and he was greatly troubled when he thought that\r\nhe had not enough of this medicine to last very long and that he would\r\nnot be able to get any more. But there was no help for it, because it\r\nwas most necessary to take precautions against the fever. At times he\r\nwould have yielded to fear and despair had it not been for the hope that\r\nSmain, if he wanted to exchange them for his own children, would have to\r\nfind a more healthy place than Fashoda for them to live in.\r\n\r\nBut misfortune seemed to follow its victims continually. The day before\r\nthey arrived in Fashoda, Dinah, who felt weak when they were in\r\nOmdurman, suddenly fainted and fell off the camel while opening Nell’s\r\ntraveling bag, which they had brought with them from Fayoum. It was only\r\nwith the greatest difficulty that Chamis and Stasch resuscitated her.\r\nBut she did not regain consciousness until toward evening, and then only\r\nlong enough to bid a tearful good-by to her beloved little lady and die.\r\nGebhr wanted very much to cut the ears off the remains, so that he could\r\nshow them to Smain as a proof that she had died on the way. That was\r\nwhat was done to slaves who died on a journey. But at the request of\r\nStasch and Nell, Hatim did not allow this, and she was buried with\r\nhonor, and stones and thorns were piled on her grave to protect it from\r\nhyenas. The children now felt even more lonely, for in losing her they\r\nhad lost the only soul who stood near to them and who was devoted to\r\nthem. To Nell especially it was a cruel blow, and during the night and\r\nthe following day Stasch tried in vain to comfort her.\r\n\r\nThe sixth week of the journey had begun. On the following day, toward\r\nnoon, the caravan reached Fashoda, but found it in ruins. The Mahdists\r\nbivouacked in the open air or in huts which had been hastily built of\r\ngrass and branches. The settlement had been completely destroyed by fire\r\nthree days before. Nothing remained but the smoke-blackened walls of the\r\nround clay huts and a wooden shed at the water’s edge, which during the\r\ntime of the Egyptian rule had been used as a storehouse for ivory, and\r\nin which at the present time lived the leader of the Dervishes, the\r\nemir, Seki Tamala. He was a man who was respected by the Mahdists, a\r\nsecret enemy of Calif Abdullah, but, on the other hand, a personal\r\nfriend of Hatim. The emir was most hospitable to the old sheik and the\r\nchildren, but at the very beginning he told them an unwelcome piece of\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nSmain was no longer in Fashoda. Two days before he had started on an\r\nexpedition after slaves in the district lying southeast of the Nile, and\r\nno one knew when he would return, for the next settlement had been\r\ndeserted, so that it was necessary to seek merchandise in human beings\r\nat a great distance. It is true that not very far from Fashoda lies\r\nAbyssinia, with which country the Dervishes were at war. But Smain, who\r\nhad only three hundred men, did not dare cross the borders, which were\r\nstrictly guarded by the warlike inhabitants of the land and by the\r\nsoldiers of King John.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Seki Tamala and Hatim had to decide what was\r\nto be done with the children. The consultation was carried on chiefly\r\nduring supper, to which the emir had also invited Stasch and Nell.\r\n\r\n“I,” said he to Hatim, “with all my men must soon undertake a long\r\nexpedition to the south, against Emin Pasha, who is in Lado, where he\r\nhas steamers and soldiers. Hatim, you brought me the order to go. You\r\nmust return to Omdurman, and then not a human being will be left in\r\nFashoda. There are no comfortable houses here and nothing to eat, and\r\nbesides, it is a very unhealthy place. I know that white people do not\r\ntake smallpox, but the fever would kill these children in a month’s\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“I received orders to bring them to Fashoda,” answered Hatim, “and I\r\nhave brought them here, and I do not really need to trouble myself\r\nfurther about them. But my friend, the Greek Kaliopuli, commended them\r\nto me, and for that reason I should not like them to die.”\r\n\r\n“But that is what will certainly happen!”\r\n\r\n“Then what is to be done?”\r\n\r\n“Instead of leaving them behind in Fashoda, where there is not a human\r\nbeing, send them to Smain with the people who brought them to Omdurman.\r\nSmain has gone off toward the mountains, to a dry and high district,\r\nwhere the fever is not so fatal as here by the river.”\r\n\r\n“But how will they find Smain?”\r\n\r\n“By following the track of the fires. He will set fire to the jungle, in\r\nthe first place, so as to drive the game into the ravines, where it can\r\nbe easily hunted down, and secondly, to frighten away the heathen from\r\nthe thickets, where they have fled from their pursuers——and so it will\r\nnot be difficult to find Smain.”\r\n\r\n“But will they be able to overtake him?”\r\n\r\n“He will sometimes remain a whole week in a place, as he has to smoke\r\nmeat. But even if he should go on after two or three days, they will\r\ncertainly overtake him.”\r\n\r\n“But why should they run after him? He will return to Fashoda.”\r\n\r\n“No; if he should be successful in his hunt for slaves he will take them\r\nto the towns to the market——”\r\n\r\n“Then what is to be done?”\r\n\r\n“Remember that when we two leave Fashoda, if the children remain here\r\nthey will either succumb to the fever or starve to death.”\r\n\r\n“By the prophet, that is true!”\r\n\r\nSo there was nothing else to do but send the children on a new\r\nexpedition. Hatim, who had proved himself a good man, was especially\r\nworried, fearing that Gebhr—whose cruelty he had discovered during the\r\njourney—would wreak his vengeance on them. But the terrible Seki\r\nTamala, of whom even his own soldiers stood in dread, ordered the\r\nSudanese to come before him, and told him that he must deliver the\r\nchildren alive and well to Smain, and treat them well, for if he did not\r\nhe would be hanged. Besides that, the good Hatim begged the emir to give\r\nlittle Nell a slave to wait on her and to nurse her during the journey\r\nand in Smain’s camp. Nell was greatly pleased with this gift, especially\r\nwhen she found that the slave was a young girl of the Dinka tribe, with\r\npleasant features and a sweet expression.\r\n\r\nStasch knew that to remain in Fashoda meant death, so he did not beg\r\nHatim not to send them on another journey—their third. Besides, in the\r\ndepths of his soul he thought that when riding toward the southeast they\r\nwould have to approach the borders of Abyssinia, and might be able to\r\nescape. Moreover, he cherished the hope that on those dry heights Nell\r\nmight escape the fever. For all these reasons he gladly and\r\nenthusiastically began making preparations for the journey.\r\n\r\nGebhr, Chamis and the two Bedouins also had nothing to say against the\r\nexpedition, for they, too, reckoned that at Smain’s side they might be\r\nable to capture larger numbers of slaves and that they could then sell\r\nthem to advantage at the markets. They knew that slave-traders sometimes\r\nattain great wealth; at any rate, they preferred to ride instead of\r\nremaining where they were under Hatim’s and Seki Tamala’s strict rule.\r\n\r\nBut the preparations for departure took considerable time, especially\r\nbecause the children had to rest. Camels could not be used for this\r\njourney, and so the Arabs and also Stasch and Nell were to ride on\r\nhorses, while Kali, Gebhr’s slave, and Nell’s servant, who was called\r\n“Mea,” at Stasch’s suggestion were to go on foot. Hatim also supplied a\r\ndonkey, which carried a tent intended for the girl, and also enough\r\nprovisions to last the children three days. Seki Tamala could give them\r\nno more. A kind of ladies’ saddle was constructed for Nell out of palm\r\nand bamboo mats.\r\n\r\nThe children spent three days in Fashoda recovering from their journey,\r\nbut the numerous swarms of gnats by the river made a further stay\r\nimpossible. During the day there were a great many large blue flies,\r\nwhich, although they did not bite, were very troublesome because they\r\ngot into one’s ears, eyes, and mouth. Stasch had once heard in Port Said\r\nthat gnats and flies spread fever and the germs of an eye disease, so at\r\nlast he besought Seki Tamala to let them start as soon as possible,\r\nespecially as the spring rainy season was about to begin.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\nAfter the collapse of the kingdom of the Dervishes communication was\r\nagain resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n“Stasch, why do we always ride without finding Smain?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Most likely he is traveling rapidly so as to lose no time\r\nin reaching the districts where he can capture the most slaves. Would\r\nyou be glad if we could really join his division?”\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded her little blonde head as a sign that she was most\r\nwilling.\r\n\r\n“Why would you like it?” asked Stasch, surprised.\r\n\r\n“Because in the presence of Smain perhaps Gebhr would not dare beat this\r\npoor Kali so terribly.”\r\n\r\n“Probably Smain is no better. None of them has any mercy for their\r\nslaves.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are right.”\r\n\r\nAnd tears flowed down her wan cheeks. This was the ninth day of the\r\njourney. Gebhr, who was now the leader of the caravan, at first found a\r\nfew traces of Smain’s march. Stretches of burned jungle and places where\r\nhe had camped, crunched bones, and various discarded material marked his\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nFive days later they came to a wide steppe, where the wind had carried\r\nthe fire in every direction. The traces were indistinct and confusing,\r\nfor Smain had apparently divided his company into several small groups\r\nin order to facilitate cornering the game and obtaining provisions.\r\nGebhr did not know which direction to take, and it often seemed as if\r\nthe caravan had traveled around in a circle, returning to the same place\r\nfrom which it started. Then they came upon woods, and after having\r\ntraveled through them, they entered a rocky country, where the ground\r\nwas covered with flat slabs or small level stones, that for some\r\ndistance were strewn so thickly that they reminded the children of the\r\nroads in town. The vegetation was scanty. Only here and there, in the\r\nclefts of the rocks, grew euphorbias, mimosas, and rarer and slimmer\r\npale green trees, which Kali, in the Ki-swahili language, called “m’ti.”\r\nThe horses were fed with the leaves of these trees. In this land there\r\nwere very few small rivers and streams, but fortunately it rained now\r\nand then, and there was sufficient water in the cavities and clefts of\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nSmain’s party had frightened off the game, and the caravan would have\r\ndied of hunger had it not been for a number of Pentaren birds that flew\r\ninto the air every second from between the horses’ feet. Toward evening\r\nthe trees were so full of them that one had only to shoot in their\r\ndirection to bring some of them down, and they served for food. Besides,\r\nthey were not shy, for they let people approach them, and were so clumsy\r\nand heavy in preparing for flight that Saba, who generally ran in\r\nadvance of the caravan, caught and killed some of them nearly every day.\r\nChamis killed a number of these birds with his old flintlock musket that\r\nhe had stolen from one of the Dervishes under Hatim, on the road from\r\nOmdurman to Fashoda. But he only had enough shot for twenty cartridges,\r\nand he felt very much worried when he thought of what would happen when\r\nthey were used up. Notwithstanding the game had been frightened away,\r\nthey occasionally saw herds of gazels, a beautiful species of antelope\r\nwhich is found all over central Africa. These animals, however, could\r\nonly be shot, and the men did not know how to use Stasch’s gun, and\r\nGebhr would not give it to him.\r\n\r\nBut the Sudanese also began to be worried about the length of time they\r\nwere on the way. Sometimes he even thought of returning to Fashoda, for\r\nif they were to miss Smain they might get lost in the wilderness and not\r\nonly suffer from hunger, but be in danger of attack by wild animals and\r\nstill wilder negroes, who vowed vengeance on account of having been\r\nhunted for slaves. But as he did not know that Seki Tamala had\r\nundertaken an expedition against Emin Pasha, because he had not been\r\npresent when the conversation on that subject had taken place, he was\r\nalarmed at the thought of appearing before the powerful emir, who had\r\nordered him to bring the children to Smain, and who had given him a\r\nletter to take to him, threatening that if he did not execute his orders\r\nfaithfully he would be hanged. All this combined to fill his heart with\r\nbitterness and rage. Though he did not dare to vent his disappointments\r\non Stasch and Nell, poor Kali’s back was daily covered with blood from\r\nbeing beaten with the scourge. The slave always approached his cruel\r\nmaster in fear and trembling. But in vain did he clasp him by the feet\r\nand kiss his hands, and fall on his face before him. Neither humility\r\nnor groans softened the stony heart; for on the slightest pretext, and\r\nsometimes without any provocation at all, the scourge tore the flesh of\r\nthe unhappy boy. During the night his feet were chained to a piece of\r\nwood with two holes in it, so that he could not run away. During the\r\ndaytime he walked alongside of Gebhr’s horse, attached to it by a rope,\r\nwhich greatly amused Chamis. Nell shed tears for poor Kali. Stasch\r\nrevolted in his heart, and often valiantly championed Kali, but when he\r\nnoticed that this annoyed Gebhr still more he simply clenched his teeth\r\nand was silent.\r\n\r\nKali perceived that they both sympathized with him, and he began to grow\r\nvery fond of them.\r\n\r\nFor two days they had ridden through a rocky ravine enclosed by high,\r\nsteep rocks. From the stones which had collected in the wildest\r\nconfusion it could plainly be seen that the ravine was filled with water\r\nduring the rainy season, but now the ground was quite dry. On both\r\nsides, up against the cliffs, grew a little grass, a great many thorns,\r\nand here and there even a few trees. Gebhr had ridden into this stony\r\ngorge because it continually went up hill and he thought it would lead\r\nto some height from which, by day, it would be easier to see the smoke\r\nand by night the flames of Smain’s camp-fire. In some places the ravine\r\nbecame so narrow that only two horses could walk abreast, while in\r\nothers it expanded into small circular valleys enclosed on all sides by\r\nhigh stone walls, on which sat large apes, that played with one another,\r\nand on seeing the caravan barked and showed their teeth.\r\n\r\nIt was five o’clock in the afternoon. The sun was already low in the\r\nwest. Gebhr had begun to think of their night quarters. He was hoping to\r\nreach a small valley, in which he could erect a zareba—to surround the\r\ncaravan and the horses with a hedge of prickly mimosas and acacias, to\r\nprotect them from being attacked by wild beasts. Saba ran in advance,\r\nbarking at the monkeys, which, on seeing him, moved about restlessly,\r\nand he disappeared time and again in the windings of the ravine, his\r\nloud barks being repeated by the echoes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Saba became silent. Soon after he came up at a gallop, the hair\r\non his back bristling, his tail down, and ran up to the horses. The\r\nBedouins and Gebhr knew at once that something must have frightened him,\r\nbut after they had looked around questioningly they continued on their\r\nway to investigate the reason. But when they had passed a small bend\r\nthey reined in their horses, and for a moment remained as if rooted to\r\nthe spot at the sight that presented itself before them.\r\n\r\nOn a large rock in the middle of the ravine, which was fairly broad at\r\nthis place, lay a lion. They could not have been more than a hundred\r\nfeet from him. As soon as the powerful animal saw the riders and horses\r\nhe rose on his hind legs and stared at them with gleaming eyes. The rays\r\nof the setting sun shone on his enormous head and shaggy breast, and in\r\nthis red light he resembled one of those sphinxes that ornament the\r\nentrances to the ancient Egyptian temples.\r\n\r\nThe frightened horses began to rear, turn around, and prance backward.\r\nThe astonished and terrified riders did not know what to do, and\r\nfrightened and perplexed, cried out as with one voice: “Allah!\r\nBismillah! Allah Akbar!”\r\n\r\nThe desert king, motionless as bronze, surveyed them from head to foot.\r\n\r\nGebhr and Chamis had heard from merchants who had brought ivory and\r\nrubber from Sudan to Egypt that lions sometimes obstruct the route, and\r\nthat the only thing for a caravan to do is to make a detour around the\r\nbeast. But now they were in a place from which there was no means of\r\nexit but to turn back and run away, and then it was almost certain that\r\nthe terrible beast would follow them.\r\n\r\nOnce more the feverish question was asked:\r\n\r\n“What is to be done?”\r\n\r\n“Allah! Perhaps he will back out!”\r\n\r\n“He will not move out of the way.”\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence. Not a sound could be heard except the snorting\r\nof the horses and the rapid breathing of the party.\r\n\r\n“Loose Kali from the rope,” suddenly said Chamis to Gebhr, “and we will\r\nescape on the horses; then the lion will catch him first, and he will be\r\nthe only one slain.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, do so!” replied the Bedouins.\r\n\r\nBut Gebhr thought Kali would immediately climb up the side of the cliff,\r\nwhile the lion would make a bee-line for the horses. With this in his\r\nmind another idea, still more terrible, flashed upon him. He would kill\r\nthe slave and throw him behind him—then if the beast were to follow\r\nthem he would see the bloody body lying on the ground and stop to devour\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo he drew Kali by the rope nearer to his saddle, and had already raised\r\nhis knife—when Stasch caught hold of him by his wide sleeve:\r\n\r\n“Villain, what are you doing?”\r\n\r\nGebhr tried to tear himself loose, and if the boy had caught hold of the\r\narm itself he would have been shaken off at once, but as he had hold of\r\nthe sleeve, it was not so easy, and while Gebhr tried to tear himself\r\nloose he gesticulated and cried in a voice thick with rage:\r\n\r\n“Dog, if that one is not sufficient, I will stab you, too. Allah! I will\r\nstab you, stab you!”\r\n\r\nStasch became white as a ghost. Like a flash of lightning he thought\r\nthat if the lion should follow the horses he might in the pursuit\r\noverlook Kali’s body, and in that case Gebhr would certainly stab them\r\nall, one after the other.\r\n\r\nPulling Gebhr’s sleeve with increased energy, Stasch screamed out:\r\n\r\n“Give me the rifle and I will kill the lion!”\r\n\r\nThe Bedouins were speechless from surprise at these words, but Chamis,\r\nwho in Port Said had seen how well Stasch could shoot, immediately cried\r\nout:\r\n\r\n“Give him the gun! He will kill the lion!”\r\n\r\nGebhr also recalled the shooting at Karoon Lake, and in face of their\r\nterrible danger he at once ceased to make further resistance, and\r\nhastily handed the gun to the boy, while Chamis hurriedly opened the\r\ncartridge case, from which Stasch took out a handful.\r\n\r\nThe boy jumped off his horse, shoved the cartridges into the barrel of\r\nthe gun, and advanced. While taking his first steps forward he felt\r\nstunned, and pictured himself and Nell with their throats cut from ear\r\nto ear by Gebhr’s knife. But soon the imminent and terrible danger they\r\nwere in made him oblivious to everything else. A lion was before him!\r\nWhen he first caught sight of the beast everything became black before\r\nhis eyes. His cheeks and nose felt icy cold, his legs grew heavy as\r\nlead, and his breath threatened to give out. In short, he was\r\nfrightened! In Port Said he always preferred to read something else\r\nrather than stories of lion hunts, but it is one thing to look at\r\npictures in a book and another thing to stand face to face with a\r\nmonster such as now looked at him in surprise while drawing up its\r\nbroad, shield-like forehead.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs were breathless, for never in their lives had they seen\r\nanything like this. On one side a small boy, who, in contrast to the\r\nhigh rock, looked still smaller, and on the other a powerful beast,\r\nshining like gold in the rays of the sun, magnificent, threatening,\r\nreally a “Lord with a large head,” as the Sudanese call him.\r\n\r\nStasch’s iron will quickly controlled his trembling limbs, and he\r\nadvanced still further. It seemed to him as if his heart were in his\r\nthroat, until he put up the gun to take aim. Now was the time to have\r\none’s wits about one! Should he go still nearer or fire from where he\r\nstood? Where should he aim? The shorter the distance the surer the shot!\r\nSo he went still nearer, he advanced forty steps— Still too far\r\noff!—thirty!—twenty! The wind now brought to him the strong scent of\r\nthe wild animal——\r\n\r\nThe boy stopped.\r\n\r\n“A ball between the eyes, or I am lost!” thought he. “In the name of the\r\nFather and of the Son——”\r\n\r\nThe lion got up, stretched himself, and lowered his head. His mouth\r\nbegan to open and his eyes to narrow. Who was this tiny being that dared\r\ncome so near? Ready to spring, he crouched on his hind legs, his paws\r\nslightly twitching——\r\n\r\nAt this instant Stasch sighted the gun straight at the middle of the\r\nanimal’s forehead—and pulled the trigger. The shot resounded. The lion\r\nreared—rose to his full height—fell over on his back with his four\r\npaws in the air, and in his death agony rolled off the rock, plunging\r\ndown to the bottom of the ravine.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes Stasch still kept him within range of the gun, but\r\nwhen he saw that the twitching had ceased, and that the yellow body lay\r\nthere motionless and stiff, he opened the gun and put in another\r\ncartridge.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the cliffs still rang out with loud echoes. Gebhr, Chamis,\r\nand the Bedouins could not at first realize what had happened, for it\r\nhad rained during the previous night, and on account of the humidity in\r\nthe air the smoke hid everything in the narrow ravine. But when it\r\ndisappeared they shouted for joy and tried to rush up to the boy, but\r\ntheir efforts were in vain, for no power on earth could force the horses\r\nto take even one step forward.\r\n\r\nStasch turned, took in the four Arabs at a glance, and fixed his eyes on\r\nGebhr.\r\n\r\n“Enough!” he said, clenching his teeth together. “The measure is more\r\nthan full. You shall murder neither Nell nor any one else.”\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly he felt his cheeks and nose again grow cold, but this was a\r\ndifferent kind of cold—not caused by fright, but by a terrible, fixed\r\nresolve, that suddenly hardened his heart like steel.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it must be!” he said to himself. “They are all villains, hangmen,\r\nmurderers—and Nell is in their hands!”\r\n\r\n“You shall not kill her!” he repeated.\r\n\r\nHe approached them—and drew back a pace—then suddenly raised the gun\r\nto his shoulder.\r\n\r\nTwo shots, following in quick succession, echoed through the ravine!\r\nGebhr fell to the ground like a bag of sand. Chamis leaned forward in\r\nhis saddle and struck the horse’s neck with his bloody forehead.\r\n\r\nThe two Bedouins screamed with fright, and springing from their horses,\r\nrushed at Stasch. The bend in the ravine was directly behind them, and\r\nhad they fled there, as Stasch ardently hoped, they would have been able\r\nto escape death. But blinded by fear and rage, they thought to reach the\r\nboy and stab him before he had time to reload. Fools! They had scarcely\r\ngone a few steps when the trigger clicked again. The ravine rang with\r\nthe echoes of the shots and both men fell face downward to the ground,\r\nwriggling like fish out of water.\r\n\r\nOne of them was shot in the throat and not very dangerously wounded; he\r\nrose again and supported himself on his hands, but at the same moment\r\nSaba buried his teeth in his neck.\r\n\r\nDead silence ensued.\r\n\r\nThis was interrupted by groans from Kali, who on his knees with\r\noutstretched hands screamed in disjointed Ki-swahili sentences:\r\n\r\n“Bwana Kubwa![16] Kill the lion! Kill the bad people! But do not kill\r\nKali!”\r\n\r\nStasch did not listen to his cries. For a while he stood there as in a\r\ndaze. Then he saw Nell’s pale little face and her frightened, wide-open,\r\nwondering eyes. Springing toward her, he cried:\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid, Nell! We are free, Nell!”\r\n\r\nTrue, they were free, but free in the midst of a wild, uninhabited\r\nsolitude, lost in the heart of the black country.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\nGreat Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Through the Desert\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBefore Stasch and the young negro could dispose of the dead bodies of\r\nthe Arabs and the carcass of the lion the sun had nearly set, and night\r\nwas approaching. But they could not possibly pass the night near the\r\ncorpses, and although Kali, stroking his chest and stomach with his\r\nhand, pointed to the dead lion as he smacked his lips, and repeated,\r\n“_Msuri, nyama_” (“good, good meat”), Stasch would not permit him to\r\ntouch the “_nyama_,” but told him to catch the horses, which had run\r\naway at the report of the guns. The black boy executed this order very\r\ncleverly, for instead of following them into the valley—in which case\r\nthey would have continued to run further away—he climbed up the side of\r\nthe hill and so took a short cut across corners and headed off the\r\nfrightened animals. In this manner he caught two of them easily, and the\r\nother two he drove toward Stasch.\r\n\r\nBut Gebhr’s and Chamis’ horses could not be found. Besides these there\r\nremained four saddle-horses, not counting the mule which carried the\r\ntent and the baggage, and which had been very calm throughout all these\r\ntragical events. The donkey was found behind a corner quietly grazing on\r\nthe grass that grew in the bottom of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe Sudan horses are quite accustomed to the sight of wild animals,\r\nthough they are afraid of lions. Therefore it took a great deal of\r\npersuasion to induce them to pass the rock and the pool of blood. The\r\nhorses neighed, snorted, and drew their heads back at the sight of the\r\nbloodstained stones, but no sooner did the donkey prick up his ears and\r\npass by quietly than they followed. Though night had now begun to fall,\r\nthey walked on for a while, and only stopped on reaching a place where\r\nthe valley narrowed once more into a small amphitheater mostly covered\r\nwith thorns and prickly mimosa bushes.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the young negro, “Kali will make a fire, a large fire.”\r\n\r\nAnd he took a broad Sudanese sword which he had removed from Gebhr’s\r\ncorpse and used it to cut down the thorns and large bushes. After he\r\nlighted the fire he continued to chop wood until he had a sufficient\r\namount to last through the night.\r\n\r\nThen he and Stasch began to set up on the steep side of the valley a\r\nsmall tent for Nell, which they enclosed with a broad and high prickly\r\nhedge shaped like a half moon, or with a so-called “Zareba.”\r\n\r\nStasch knew from descriptions given by African travelers that they are\r\nthus able to protect themselves against the onslaughts of wild animals.\r\nBut there was not enough room behind the hedge for the horses, and\r\ntherefore the boys removed the saddles, harnesses, and bags from the\r\nanimals, and only tied their feet, so that when searching for grass and\r\nwater they would not stray away too far.\r\n\r\nIn fact, water was to be found quite near, in a crevice of a rock which\r\nformed a small basin under the opposite boulder. There was enough to\r\nquench the thirst of the horses and some to spare for the following\r\nmorning in which to cook the birds Chamis had shot. And in the baggage\r\nwhich the donkey carried, in addition to the tent, there were found some\r\ncorn, a little salt, and a bundle of dried manioc roots, which were\r\nsufficient for a substantial meal. But only Kali and Mea had any\r\nappetite. The young negro, who had been half starved by Gebhr, ate\r\nenough for two. He was more than grateful to his new masters, and\r\ndirectly after the meal he fell down on his face before Stasch and Nell,\r\nto denote that he would remain their slave until his dying day; and he\r\nalso showed great respect for Stasch’s rifle, possibly with the correct\r\nidea that it would be safer to obtain in advance the good will of such a\r\npowerful weapon. Then he declared that he would take turns with Mea\r\nwatching over the “Great Man” and the “Bibi” while they slept, and that\r\nhe would also see that the fire did not go out.\r\n\r\nThen he immediately squatted down in front of them, crossed his legs,\r\nand hummed a little tune, in which he invariably repeated the refrain,\r\n“_Simba kufa_, _simba kufa_,” which in the Ki-swahili language means\r\n“The lion is dead.”\r\n\r\nBut neither the “Great Man” nor the “Small Bibi” felt sleepy, and Stasch\r\nhad to coax Nell before he could induce her to taste a little of the\r\nbird and a few grains of the boiled corn. She said she could neither eat\r\nnor sleep, and that she only wanted a drink. Stasch was afraid she was\r\ngetting the fever, but he was soon convinced to the contrary, as even\r\nher hands were cold. He was eventually able to induce her to go into the\r\ntent, where he had arranged a place for her to lie down, after having at\r\nfirst carefully looked to see if there were any scorpions in the grass.\r\nAs for him, he sat down on a stone with his rifle on his arm, to guard\r\nher from an onslaught of wild animals, in case the fire should prove\r\ninsufficient protection. He was overcome by fatigue and greatly\r\nexhausted, and repeated to himself over and over again, “I have killed\r\nGebhr and Chamis and the Bedouins; I have killed a lion and we are\r\nfree.” But he felt as though some one else were whispering these words\r\nto him and that he could not comprehend their meaning. He only knew that\r\nthey were free, and at the same time something terrible had happened,\r\nwhich filled him with uneasiness and pressed like a heavy weight on his\r\nchest. At last his thoughts became indistinct. For a while he gazed at\r\nthe moth which hovered over the flame, and at last he began to nod and\r\ndoze. Kali, too, was napping, but awoke every now and then and threw\r\nbranches into the fire.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark, and—what is very unusual near the equator—very\r\nquiet. Nothing could be heard but the crackling of the burning thorns\r\nand the flickering of the flames as they lighted up the promontories of\r\nthe cliffs, which formed a half circle. The moon did not shine into the\r\ninterior of the gorge, but millions of strange stars twinkled. The air\r\nhad become so cold that Stasch awoke, sleepy and chilly, and he was\r\nalarmed lest the cold might harm little Nell.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was reassured when he remembered that he had left for her,\r\non the rug in the tent, the shawl which Dinah had taken away from\r\nFayoum. He also remembered that they had unknowingly been riding up hill\r\nfrom the time they quitted the banks of the Nile, and that consequently\r\nnow, after several days of travel, they ought to be fairly high up, so\r\nas to be beyond any danger from fever, which infested the land by the\r\nriver. The penetrating chilliness of the night seemed to substantiate\r\nhis opinion.\r\n\r\nThis thought gave him courage. He entered the tent for a moment to hear\r\nif Nell was sleeping peacefully, then he returned, settled down nearer\r\nthe fire, and began to doze once more, and in fact soon fell fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Saba, who had stretched himself out to sleep at his feet,\r\naroused him by growling.\r\n\r\nKali awoke also, and both began to look anxiously at the dog. He lay\r\nthere tense as the string of a bow, pricking up his ears, with dilated\r\nnostrils, sniffing the air, and staring into the darkness in the\r\ndirection from which they had come. The hair on his neck and his back\r\nstood on end, his chest expanded with his heavy breathing, and he\r\ngrowled.\r\n\r\nThe young slave hurriedly threw some branches on the fire.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he whispered, “take your gun, take your gun.”\r\n\r\nStasch took up his rifle and crouched in front of the fire so that he\r\ncould get a better view of the dark bend of the gorge. Saba’s growls\r\nchanged into a short bark. For a little while there was no sound; then\r\nfrom a distance Kali and Stasch heard a dull tramping, as though large\r\nanimals were running toward the fire. This tramping resounded through\r\nthe night, echoed from cliff to cliff, and increased every second.\r\n\r\nStasch felt that great danger was approaching. But what could it be?\r\nPerhaps buffaloes or a couple of rhinoceroses trying to find their way\r\nout of the gorge. In this case if the report of a shot were not\r\nsuccessful in frightening them and causing them to retrace their steps,\r\nnothing could save the caravan, for these animals are just as vicious\r\nand liable to attack one as animals of prey; and they have no fear of\r\nfire, and destroy everything that comes in their way.\r\n\r\nBut what if it were a division of Smain’s expedition, which, after\r\nhaving discovered the corpse in the gorge, was hunting for the murderer!\r\nStasch could not make up his mind as to which would be the better—a\r\nquick death, or to be put in prison again. At the same time it occurred\r\nto him that if Smain himself happened to be in this division he would\r\nmost likely spare them, but if he were not there the Dervishes would\r\neither murder them at once or—which would be still worse—torture them\r\nterribly before putting them to death.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” thought he, “let us pray that they are animals and not human\r\nbeings.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tramping increased, and changed into the clatter of hoofs,\r\nuntil at last out of the darkness appeared fiery eyes, dilated nostrils,\r\nand manes disheveled from running.\r\n\r\n“Horses!” exclaimed Kali.\r\n\r\nThese were really Gebhr’s and Chamis’ horses. They came running at a\r\nwild gallop, obviously driven on by fright, but as they rushed into the\r\nlight and saw their captive friends they reared, neighed, pawed the\r\nground with their hoofs, and then for a while stood motionless.\r\n\r\nStasch did not remove his gun from his shoulder. He was sure that behind\r\nthe horses the disheveled head of a lion or the flat skull of a leopard\r\nmight appear at any minute. But he waited in vain. The horses gradually\r\nquieted down, and what was more important, Saba stopped sniffing, and\r\nstretching himself out after the manner of dogs, turned round and round\r\non the same spot, curled up and closed his eyes. If animals of prey had\r\nchased the horses, it was evident that they had slowly turned back on\r\nsmelling the smoke or seeing the fire light reflected on the rocks.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, something must have frightened them very much,” said\r\nStasch to Kali; “because they were not afraid to run past the corpses of\r\nthe men and lion.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” answered the boy, “Kali imagines what has happened. A great many\r\nhyenas and jackals have entered the gorge to reach the corpses. The\r\nhorses have run away from them, and the hyenas did not pursue them\r\nbecause they were devouring Gebhr and the others—”\r\n\r\n“That may be, but go now and take the saddles off the horses and bring\r\nthe harnesses and the water-bags here. Do not be afraid; the gun will\r\nprotect you.”\r\n\r\n“Kali not afraid,” said the boy, and as he pushed aside some of the\r\nthorns that were next to the cliffs he stole out of the hedge, and at\r\nthe same time Nell stepped out of the tent.\r\n\r\nSaba arose at once, sniffed at her, and expected the customary caress.\r\nAt first she stretched out her hand, but drew it back immediately,\r\nthoroughly disgusted. “Stasch, what has happened?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Nothing; those two horses came running up here. Did their tramping\r\nawaken you?”\r\n\r\n“I was awake before, and was just going to leave the tent, but——”\r\n\r\n“But what?”\r\n\r\n“I thought you would be angry.”\r\n\r\n“I! Angry with you?”\r\n\r\nNell raised her eyes and gazed at him with a very peculiar expression,\r\nan expression he had never seen before. Over Stasch’s face then passed a\r\nlook of surprise, for from her words and looks he saw that she was\r\nterrified.\r\n\r\n“She is afraid of me,” thought he.\r\n\r\nAnd for a moment he even felt quite satisfied. Then he thought that\r\nafter all he had accomplished even Nell—who did not think of him merely\r\nas a full-grown man, but also as a terrible warrior, who inspires every\r\none with fear—should look up at him and caress him. But this feeling of\r\nelation did not last long, for his sad experience had taught him to\r\nobserve closely, and so he noticed that the girl’s restless eyes denoted\r\nnot only fear, but a certain repugnance because of what had occurred, in\r\nconsequence of the blood that had been shed and the horrors that she had\r\nwitnessed this very day.\r\n\r\nHe also immediately remembered that a moment ago she had withdrawn her\r\nhand so as to avoid stroking Saba, for he it was who had killed one of\r\nthe Bedouins. Yes, that was the reason, and did not Stasch himself feel\r\nit pressing like a nightmare on his chest. It was one thing to read at\r\nPort Said about the American trappers who killed the red-skinned Indians\r\nby the dozens in the Wild West, and another thing to do likewise one’s\r\nself, and to see men who were alive a short time before expiring in\r\ntheir last bloody agony. “Yes, certainly Nell is very much terrified,\r\nand she will always continue to have that feeling of repugnance. I am\r\nsure that she will fear me,” thought Stasch; “but in her heart of hearts\r\nshe will unconsciously never forget to think ill of what I have\r\ndone—and that is to be my reward for all I have done for her.”\r\n\r\nHis heart was bowed down by these thoughts, because he knew very well\r\nthat if it were not for Nell he would have been killed or have fled long\r\nago. Therefore it was for her sake that he had suffered so much hunger\r\nand pain, which only resulted in her standing there frightened, changed,\r\nentirely different from the little sister she was before, and who now\r\nraised her eyes to his with the old confiding look gone, and in its\r\nstead an expression of intense fear. Stasch suddenly felt very unhappy.\r\nFor the first time in his life he realized what it was to be moved;\r\nunconsciously the tears started to his eyes, and if it had not been for\r\nthe fact that it was not at all the proper thing for a fierce warrior to\r\nweep, he would most likely have done so, but he controlled himself,\r\nturned to the girl, and asked:\r\n\r\n“Nell, are you afraid?”\r\n\r\nAnd she answered softly:\r\n\r\n“It is really—so terrible!”\r\n\r\nThen Stasch told Kali to bring the rugs that lay under the saddles, and\r\nafter placing one of them over the stones on which he had dozed before,\r\nhe stretched out the second one on the ground and said:\r\n\r\n“Sit down here by me near the fire; the night is cold, isn’t it? If you\r\nare very sleepy, rest your little head on me and go to sleep.”\r\n\r\nAnd Nell could only answer:\r\n\r\n“It is really too dreadful.”\r\n\r\nStasch wrapped her up tenderly and carefully in the shawl, and then they\r\nsat there silently for a while, leaning against each other, and\r\nilluminated by the ruddy firelight, which flickered on the rocks and\r\nshone on the mica scales that studded the slope of the cliff.\r\n\r\nFrom the other side of the hedge the neighing of the horses could be\r\nheard, and now and again the sound of munching, as they chewed the grass\r\nbetween their teeth.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Nell,” began Stasch; “I was obliged to do what I did. If the\r\nlion had not been satisfied in going for Kali, but had followed our\r\nparty instead, Gebhr threatened to stab us. Do you understand? Now\r\nremember that he did not only threaten me, but you also, and he would\r\nhave executed his threat, too. I will frankly tell you that if this\r\nthreat had not been made I would not have shot them even when I did,\r\nthough I had long contemplated it. I believe I would not have done it\r\notherwise. But Gebhr drove me to the limit. Did you see how he tortured\r\nKali and Chamis; how in the meanest way he betrayed us and sold us? But\r\nhave you the least idea what would have happened if they had not found\r\nSmain? Gebhr would then have continually tortured me as well as you. It\r\nis awful to think that he beat you daily with the currycomb, and would\r\nhave tortured us both slowly to death, and after our deaths would have\r\nreturned to Fashoda and said that we had died of the fever. Nell, I did\r\nnot do it to be cruel, but I had to think of how I could save you. I was\r\nonly troubled on your account.”\r\n\r\nAnd in his face there were many traces of the sadness that filled his\r\nheart. Nell saw and understood this clearly, for she drew up closer to\r\nhim. But he fought against the momentary emotion and continued:\r\n\r\n“I shall certainly not change, and I shall protect and guide you as\r\nbefore; but as long as they were alive there was no hope of delivery.\r\nNow we can flee to Abyssinia. The Abyssinians are black and savage, but\r\nare Christians and are also enemies of the Dervishes. If you keep well\r\nwe shall succeed, as it is not very far to Abyssinia. And even if we\r\nshould not succeed, even if we should fall into Smain’s hands, do not\r\nfear that he will take revenge on us. He has never in his life seen\r\nGebhr or the Bedouins; he has seen Chamis only, but what has Chamis to\r\ndo with him? In fact, we must not even tell Smain that Chamis was with\r\nus. If we succeed in reaching Abyssinia we are saved, and if not, even\r\nthen you would be better off than now, for surely there are no more\r\nmonsters like these in the world. Nell, dear, don’t be afraid of me.”\r\n\r\nAnd to gain her confidence, and at the same time encourage her, he began\r\nto stroke her golden hair. The girl listened, at the same time raising\r\nher eyes shyly to his, for it was evident that she wanted to say\r\nsomething, but held back, hesitated, and felt afraid to speak. At last\r\nshe bent her little head down so far that her hair completely hid her\r\ntiny face, and in even softer tones than before she said:\r\n\r\n“Stasch, dear!”\r\n\r\n“What, my dearest!”\r\n\r\n“And they—they will not return?”\r\n\r\n“Who?” asked Stasch, surprised.\r\n\r\n“Those—the killed.”\r\n\r\n“Nell, what are you saying?”\r\n\r\n“I am frightened—I am afraid.”\r\n\r\nAnd her pale lips began to tremble.\r\n\r\nSilence reigned. Stasch did not believe that the dead could return to\r\nlife, but as it was night and their corpses lay quite near, he did feel\r\na little uneasy. Cold chills went down his back.\r\n\r\n“Nell, what are you saying?” he repeated. “Dinah must have taught you to\r\nbe afraid of the spirits of the dead.”\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence, because at this moment something\r\nterrible happened. Suddenly through the dead silence of the night there\r\nrang forth from out the depths of the gorge, from the place where the\r\ndead bodies lay, an extraordinary, unearthly, terrible laughter,\r\nbetokening despair, joy, cruelty, sorrow, sobs, and derision—the\r\nconvulsive, spasmodic laughter of a lunatic or of a condemned man.\r\n\r\nNell shrieked and flung her arms round Stasch, and his hair stood on\r\nend. Saba got up suddenly and began to growl.\r\n\r\nBut Kali alone, who was quietly sitting near them, raised his head\r\ncalmly and said reassuringly:\r\n\r\n“The hyenas are laughing over Gebhr and the lion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe important experience of the day, now ended, and the impressions of\r\nthat night, had so completely exhausted Stasch and Nell that when at\r\nlast they were overcome by sleep they both slept so soundly that the\r\ngirl only made her appearance outside the tent about mid-day; but Stasch\r\narose somewhat earlier from the rug that was stretched in front of the\r\nfire, and while waiting for his little companion, he ordered Kali to\r\nprepare breakfast, which, on account of the lateness of the hour, was to\r\nserve at the same time for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe bright daylight drove away the apparitions of the night, and both\r\nawoke not only rested in body, but also refreshed in mind. Nell looked\r\nbetter and felt stronger, and as both wished to leave the place where\r\nthe Sudanese who had been shot remained, they mounted their horses\r\nimmediately after their meal and rode away.\r\n\r\nGenerally at this time of day all travelers in Africa take their mid-day\r\nrest, and even the caravans of negroes take shelter under the shade of\r\nlarge trees; these are, you know, the so-called “white hours”—hours of\r\nheat and silence—during which the sun shines unmercifully, looking down\r\nfrom the sky as though seeking for some one to kill. Every animal crawls\r\nback into the bushes, the song of the bird ceases, the humming of the\r\ninsect stops, all nature sinks into utter stillness and hides, as though\r\nprotecting itself from a cruel master. But they rode along the gorge,\r\none of the walls of which threw a dark shadow, so they could go forward\r\nwithout exposing themselves to the heat. Stasch did not want to leave\r\nthe gorge for the simple reason that if on top they could be seen from\r\nafar by Smain’s division, and also because in the hollows of the rocks\r\nit would be easier for them to find water, which trickled through the\r\nopenings in the ground or dissolved into mist under the influence of the\r\nrays of the sun. The road always led imperceptibly up hill. On the walls\r\nof the cliffs could be seen deposits of sulphur from time to time; in\r\nconsequence of which the water in the crevices smelt of it, and this\r\nreminded the two children very disagreeably of Omdurman and the\r\nMahdists, who rubbed their heads with a mixture of sulphur and grease.\r\n\r\nIn other places came the musky odor of civet-cats, and cascades of\r\nlianas hung from high promontories down to the bed of the gorge,\r\nspreading a sickening smell of vanilla.\r\n\r\nThe little travelers were glad to halt in the shadow of these\r\nembroidered curtains of purple flowers, whose leaves served as food for\r\nthe horses. There were no animals to be seen, except from time to time\r\nmonkeys squatted on the edges of the rocks, like silhouettes against the\r\nsky—resembling fantastic African idols or the figures that adorn the\r\ncorners of temples in India. These overgrown men with manes showed Saba\r\ntheir teeth, screwed up their mouths to show their astonishment and\r\nanger, and at the same time hopped, blinked their eyes, and scratched\r\ntheir backs. But Saba, being quite accustomed to seeing them, paid\r\nlittle attention to their threats.\r\n\r\nThey now made rapid progress. Joy over their regained freedom drove from\r\nStasch’s breast the nightmare that had frightened him during the night.\r\nNow he was only disturbed by the thought as to what course he should\r\ntake and how he could guide Nell and himself out of this place, in which\r\na new imprisonment by the Dervishes threatened them, what course they\r\ncould plan to aid them during the long journey through the desert to\r\nkeep them from perishing of hunger and thirst, and lastly, in what\r\ndirection they should direct their steps. Stasch remembered that, when\r\nwith Hatim, he heard that the distance from Fashoda to the frontier of\r\nAbyssinia was not more than five days’ journey as the bird flies, and he\r\nreckoned that this would be about one hundred English miles. But it was\r\nnow two weeks since they left Fashoda; it was therefore certain that\r\nthey had not taken the shortest way, but that the search after Smain had\r\nled them much farther south. He remembered that on the sixth day of the\r\njourney they passed a river which was not the Nile, and that then,\r\nbefore the ground had become hilly, they had ridden past great swamps.\r\n\r\nIn the school at Port Said the geography of Africa was very thoroughly\r\nand carefully taught, and Stasch remembered that in describing Ballors\r\nmention was made of an almost unknown stream that ran through swampy\r\nland—the Soba River—and flowed into the Nile. He was not quite sure\r\nwhether or not they had passed by this particular stream, but at any\r\nrate he thought they had. He also remembered that when Smain wanted to\r\ncapture slaves he did not seek them in the eastern extremity of Fashoda,\r\nas the people of that district had been destroyed by the Dervishes and\r\nthe smallpox; but he preferred the road toward the south, in districts\r\nwhich had not been discovered by previous expeditions. Therefore Stasch\r\nconcluded that they were probably following in Smain’s tracks. This\r\nthought at first frightened him, and he began to consider whether they\r\nought not to desert the gorge, which it was plain continued toward the\r\nsouth, and march straight toward the east.\r\n\r\nBut after some consideration he gave up the idea; on the contrary,\r\nthought he, the safest course would be to follow the footsteps of\r\nSmain’s company at a distance of two or three days behind them, for it\r\nwas quite uncertain whether Smain with his merchandise of human beings\r\nwould return by the same route instead of taking the straight course\r\ntoward the Nile. Stasch also knew that Abyssinia could be reached only\r\nfrom the south, where this country borders the desert, and not by the\r\neastern frontier, which was strictly guarded by Dervishes. Consequently\r\nhe decided to advance as far as possible toward the south.\r\n\r\nOne might very likely come across negroes there, either those who had\r\nsettled there or those who had taken refuge there from the banks of the\r\nWhite Nile. But if he had to choose between the two evils, Stasch would\r\nrather deal with the blacks than with the Mahdists; besides he also\r\nreckoned that, in case they should strike fugitives or settlers, Kali\r\nand Mea could be of assistance to him. A mere glance at the negress\r\nshowed that she belonged to the tribe of Dinka or Schilluk, for she had\r\nexceptionally long, thin legs and large feet, which are typical of both\r\nthese tribes, which live on the banks of the Nile and wade through its\r\nbed like storks and cranes. Kali, on the contrary, although he had\r\nbecome as thin as a skeleton when in Gebhr’s hands, now presented quite\r\na different aspect. He was small and heavily built, had strong arms,\r\nand, in comparison with Mea, proportionately short legs and small feet.\r\n\r\nAs Kali did not understand a word of Arabian, and only spoke the\r\nKi-swahili language very badly (a knowledge of which will make one\r\nunderstood nearly everywhere throughout Africa, and which Stasch had\r\npractically learned from the Zanzibar negroes working on the canal), it\r\nwas evident that he came from some remote district.\r\n\r\nStasch therefore decided to ask him where he did come from.\r\n\r\n“Kali, what is the name of your nation?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Wa-hima,” the young negro answered.\r\n\r\n“Is it a great nation?”\r\n\r\n“A very great one, which wages war with the wicked Samburu, and captures\r\ntheir cattle.”\r\n\r\n“And where is your village?”\r\n\r\n“Far away, far away—Kali does not know where it is.”\r\n\r\n“In a land like this?”\r\n\r\n“No. In that country there is a great body of water and also mountains.”\r\n\r\n“What is the name of this sheet of water?”\r\n\r\n“We call it ‘The Great Water.’ ”\r\n\r\nStasch thought that perhaps the boy had come from the Albert Nyanza\r\ndistrict, which until the present time was in Emin Pasha’s hands, and to\r\nmake sure of this he inquired further.\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t a white chief live there who has black smoking ships and\r\nsoldiers?”\r\n\r\n“No; the old people tell us that they have seen white people,” and with\r\nthis Kali raised his fingers, counting one, two, three. “Kali has never\r\nseen them, because he was not born there, but Kali’s father received\r\nthem and gave them many cows.”\r\n\r\n“What is your father?”\r\n\r\n“King of the Wa-hima.”\r\n\r\nStasch was not a little flattered at the thought that he had a prince\r\nfor his servant.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to see your father?”\r\n\r\n“Kali wants to see his mother.”\r\n\r\n“And what would you do if we met Wa-hima people? And what would they\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n“The Wa-hima would fall on their faces before Kali.”\r\n\r\n“Then conduct us to them and you can stay with them and reign as your\r\nfather’s heir, and we will ride on toward the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Kali will not meet them and will not stay there, for Kali loves the\r\n‘Great Man’ and the ‘Daughter of the Moon.’ ”\r\n\r\nStasch turned round cheerfully to his companion and said:\r\n\r\n“Nell, you have become a Daughter of the Moon.”\r\n\r\nBut as he looked at her he suddenly became sad, for it struck him that\r\nthe little maid, who had suffered greatly from the fatigue of the\r\njourney, with her pale, transparent face in reality looked more like an\r\ninhabitant of the moon than a dweller on this earth.\r\n\r\nThe young negro also remained silent for a moment, then he continued:\r\n\r\n“Kali loves Bwana Kubwa, for Bwana Kubwa did not kill Kali—only Gebhr\r\nkilled him—he gave Kali plenty to eat.”\r\n\r\nAnd he stroked his chest and stomach and repeated with visible delight:\r\n\r\n“Plenty of meat, plenty of meat.”\r\n\r\nStasch would have liked to find out how the boy had been imprisoned by\r\nthe Dervishes, but it turned out that on a certain night after he had\r\nbeen captured in one of the trenches dug to entrap zebras, he had\r\nalready been through so many hands that one could not decide from his\r\nanswer through what countries and by what route he had at last reached\r\nFashoda. Stasch was impressed by what he said about the “Great Water,”\r\nfor if he had come from the district of Albert Nyanza, Albert Edward\r\nNyanza, or even from the Victoria Nyanza, round which the kingdoms of\r\nUnyoro and Uganda lie, he would undoubtedly have heard something of Emin\r\nPasha, his soldiers, and steamers, which raised consternation and fear\r\nin the minds of the negroes. The Tanganyika was too far distant, and so\r\nthe only supposition that remained was that Kali’s race must have its\r\nhome somewhere in the vicinity of the waters of Rudolf and Stefanie.\r\nThese lands were also fairly remote, but the expedition was at least\r\nhalf way on its journey, so while the lands could not be said to be very\r\nnear Fashoda, still they were near the place where the travelers now\r\nwere—and it was quite possible that they might meet the Wa-hima.\r\n\r\nAfter a ride of many hours the sun began to set, and the heat had abated\r\nconsiderably. They reached a wide plain, where there was water and where\r\nwild figs grew, so they made a halt to give the horses a rest and to\r\nrefresh themselves with food. As the walls of the cliffs were lower at\r\nthis point, Stasch ordered Kali to climb up and look around to see if\r\nthere was any smoke.\r\n\r\nKali obeyed, and was soon on the edge of the cliffs. He carefully\r\nnoticed everything on all sides and then slid down on a thick liana, and\r\nsaid that there was no smoke, but “Nyama.” It was easy to guess that he\r\ndid not mean birds, but some kind of big game, for he pointed to\r\nStasch’s rifle and then put his finger to his head as a sign that they\r\nwere horned animals.\r\n\r\nThen Stasch climbed the height, and carefully raising his head over the\r\nedge of the cliff, began to look around.\r\n\r\nNothing interrupted the view, for the high jungle had been destroyed by\r\nfire, and the new one, shooting forth from the charred earth, was\r\nscarcely a foot high. All around as far as eye could reach were\r\nscattered tall trees still growing, whose trunks had been scorched by\r\nthe flames. In the shade of one of these trees a herd of antelope was\r\ngrazing, their bodies resembling horses and their heads buffaloes. The\r\nsunlight peering through the branches made bright spots of light on\r\ntheir brown backs.\r\n\r\nThere were nine of them, and they were not more than a hundred feet\r\naway. As the wind was blowing from the animals toward the ravine, they\r\ncontinued feeding quietly, fearing no danger. Stasch, who was desirous\r\nof providing meat for the caravan, fired upon the nearest animal, which\r\nfell as though struck by lightning. The others fled, and with them a\r\nhuge buffalo, which they had not seen before, because it had been hidden\r\nby a large stone. The boy’s pride as a huntsman was aroused, and waiting\r\nfor the animal to turn round, he sent a bullet through it. The buffalo\r\nswayed heavily as soon as it was hit, and ran off; and before Stasch was\r\nable to change his cartridges it had disappeared behind a hillock.\r\nBefore the smoke had cleared away Kali ran to the antelope and ripped it\r\nopen with Gebhr’s knife. Stasch went up to him to get a nearer view of\r\nthe animal, and was much surprised when the young negro took the liver\r\nof the antelope, which was still warm, in his blood-stained hands and\r\npresented it to him.\r\n\r\n“Why do you give it to me?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Msuri! Msuri! Bwana Kubwa, eat now.”\r\n\r\n“Eat it yourself,” answered Stasch, disgusted at the suggestion.\r\n\r\nKali did not wait to be told twice. He at once began to tear the liver\r\nto pieces with his teeth and greedily swallow the raw bits. But seeing\r\nthat Stasch looked at him with disgust, he did not stop between\r\nmouthfuls, but continually repeated, “Msuri! Msuri!”\r\n\r\nAfter Kali had eaten more than half the liver, he began skinning the\r\nantelope, which he did very quickly and so dexterously that the skin was\r\nsoon removed. Stasch was surprised that Saba was not there to help in\r\nthis work, so he whistled to invite him to the feast.\r\n\r\nSaba did not come, but Kali, who was bending over the antelope, looked\r\nup and said:\r\n\r\n“The big dog has gone after the buffalo.”\r\n\r\n“Did you see him?” said Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Kali saw it.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this he lifted the body of the antelope with both hands, and\r\nplacing it upon his shoulder, he went off toward the gorge.\r\n\r\nStasch whistled once more and waited, but as he found that it was of no\r\navail, he followed Kali. In the gorge they found Mea busily cutting\r\nthorns from the hedge, and Nell, who was plucking their last bird with\r\nher tiny fingers, said:\r\n\r\n“Did you whistle for Saba? He ran after you.”\r\n\r\n“He ran after a buffalo which I shot and I am worried about him,”\r\nanswered Stasch. “These animals are so large and powerful that even a\r\nlion is afraid to attack them. If Saba should try to fight one of them\r\nhe would fare badly.”\r\n\r\nWhen Nell heard this she was worried also, and declared that she would\r\nnot go to bed until Saba returned. When Stasch saw how grieved she was\r\nhe felt angry with himself for not having concealed the danger from her,\r\nand he tried to console her.\r\n\r\n“I would have followed them with my rifle, but now they must be far\r\naway; besides, night is approaching and their trail can not be seen. The\r\nbuffalo was hit squarely, and I hope it will fall. At any rate, it will\r\nbe so much exhausted from loss of blood that even if it were to fall\r\nupon Saba, the dog could run away in time. Yes, he may not return till\r\nnight, but he will surely return.”\r\n\r\nStasch himself did not believe what he said, because he remembered what\r\nhe had heard about the vindictiveness of the African buffalo, which,\r\neven when severely wounded, runs round in a circle and watches to see\r\nwhich way the hunter goes, so as to attack him unawares, tossing him\r\nhigh in the air with its horns. Quite likely Saba might have met with a\r\nsimilar fate, besides other dangers to which he might be subjected in\r\nhis journey by night.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it had become dark Kali and Mea managed to make a hedge\r\nfence, light a fire, and get supper ready. But even then there was no\r\nsign of Saba.\r\n\r\nNell became very uneasy and began to cry. Stasch insisted on her lying\r\ndown and going to sleep, and he promised her to wait up for Saba and to\r\nlook for him and bring him back as soon as daylight appeared. Nell\r\nentered the tent, but thrust out her little head continually to inquire\r\nif the dog had returned. She did not fall asleep till after midnight,\r\nwhen Mea left the tent to relieve Kali, who until now had watched by the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n“Why does the Daughter of the Moon cry?” asked Kali, and Stasch, as they\r\nboth lay down on thin wooden benches to sleep, said:\r\n\r\n“She is worried, fearing that Saba is killed by the buffalo.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he has killed it,” answered the young negro.\r\n\r\nThen they stopped talking and Stasch went fast asleep. He awoke while it\r\nwas still dark because it had become colder. Mea, who was supposed to be\r\non the watch, had fallen asleep, and so it had been some time since she\r\nhad put dry wood on the expiring flames.\r\n\r\nNo one was lying upon the felt quilt on which Kali had slept.\r\n\r\nStasch threw firewood on the glowing ashes, nudged the negress and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n“Where’s Kali?”\r\n\r\nFor a time she stared at him as though in a trance, and then, when wide\r\nawake, she said:\r\n\r\n“Kali has taken Gebhr’s knife and gone outside of the hedge. I thought\r\nhe went to get more wood for the fire, but he has not returned yet.”\r\n\r\n“Has he been gone a long while?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a long while.”\r\n\r\nStasch waited some time, but as the negro did not return, he reluctantly\r\nasked himself, “Could he have run away?”\r\n\r\nHe felt a pain in his heart like that experienced by those who have met\r\nwith ingratitude. He had befriended Kali and protected him when Gebhr\r\ntortured him daily, and had eventually saved his life. Nell always liked\r\nhim, she wept over his misfortunes, and they both were as kind as could\r\nbe to him, and yet he had now run away! He often said that he had no\r\nidea in which direction the settlements of the Wa-hima lay, and that he\r\ncould not find his way there—and still he had run away.\r\n\r\nStasch again remembered the description of travels in Africa which he\r\nhad read in Port Said, the accounts of the travelers, the stupidity of\r\nthe negroes in throwing away the luggage and deserting—for even if\r\nthreatened with the punishment of certain death they did so just the\r\nsame. Evidently Kali, whose only weapon was a Sudanese sword, would\r\nsuccumb to starvation or be recaptured by the Dervishes, unless devoured\r\nby wild beasts.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the ungrateful wretch! And what a fool!”\r\n\r\nStasch seriously began to think how much more difficult the journey\r\nwould be for them without Kali and how much more heavily the work would\r\nfall on the others. To water the horses and tie them for the night, to\r\nput up the tent and the hedge, to guard the luggage and to see that the\r\nprovisions were not lost, to skin and cut up the slain animals, all\r\nduties which Kali had performed, would, through loss of the negro, fall\r\nto his share, and he was obliged to confess to himself that he had no\r\ndefinite idea how to do many of these things, as, for instance, skinning\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n“Well, what else can I do?” said he. “It will have to be done.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun appeared above the horizon, and, as is always the case\r\nat the equator, it was daylight in a minute. A little after this the\r\nwater in the tent, that Mea had prepared for the little lady to wash in,\r\nbegan to splash, by which Stasch knew that Nell had arisen and that she\r\nwas dressing. Somewhat later she appeared completely dressed, but with\r\nher comb in her hands and her hair not arranged.\r\n\r\n“What about Saba?” asked she.\r\n\r\n“He has not returned yet.”\r\n\r\nThe corners of the girl’s mouth began to tremble.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he will come back yet,” said Stasch. “You remember that\r\nsometimes in the desert he was missing for two whole days, and yet he\r\nalways came back to us.”\r\n\r\n“You said that you were going to look for him.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t.”\r\n\r\n“Why not, Stasch?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is impossible for me to leave you alone with Mea.”\r\n\r\n“And Kali?”\r\n\r\n“Kali is not here.”\r\n\r\nHe drew back, debating with himself whether or not he ought to tell her\r\nthe whole truth; but as it would be impossible to hide it, he concluded\r\nthat it would be better to tell her everything.\r\n\r\n“Kali has taken Gebhr’s sword,” he said, “and he went away during the\r\nnight, no one knows where. Who can tell? He may have run away. Negroes\r\noften do this, even to their own detriment. I am sorry—but perhaps he\r\nwill now see that he has acted foolishly and——”\r\n\r\nThe next words were drowned by Saba’s joyful bark, which penetrated the\r\ngorge. Nell threw down the comb and tried to run toward him, but the\r\nthorns in the hedge prevented her.\r\n\r\nStasch at once began to tear down a part of the hedge, but before he had\r\nsucceeded in even making a passage Saba appeared, and behind him Kali,\r\nshining and wet with dew as though soaked through by a very heavy\r\nshower.\r\n\r\nBoth children were overcome with joy, and as soon as Kali, who was so\r\nfatigued from his exertions that he could scarcely get his breath,\r\nreached the inside of the hedge, Nell threw her little arms around his\r\nblack neck, hugging him tight.\r\n\r\n“Kali does not like to see the Bibi cry,” he said, “so Kali looked for\r\nthe dog and found him.”\r\n\r\n“Good Kali,” cried Stasch, patting him on the shoulder; “and were you\r\nnot afraid that you would meet a lion or a leopard during the night?”\r\n\r\n“Kali afraid, but Kali go,” answered the young man.\r\n\r\nThese words endeared him still more to the children. At Nell’s request\r\nStasch took from one of the bundles a string of glass beads which the\r\nGreek Kaliopuli had given them when they left Omdurman, and placed them\r\naround Kali’s neck. He was delighted with the gift, and looking proudly\r\nat Mea, said:\r\n\r\n“Mea has no glass beads, but Kali has, for Kali is ‘Great World.’ ”\r\n\r\nIn this way the sacrifice of the black boy was rewarded. Saba, on the\r\ncontrary, received a severe reprimand, from which he was made to\r\nunderstand for the second time during the period he had been with Nell,\r\nthat he was very naughty and that if he ever did such a thing again he\r\nwould be led by a leash like a small dog. He listened to this sermon\r\nwhile wagging his tail with rather a double meaning. But Nell was sure\r\nthat she saw by the expression of his eyes that he was ashamed, and that\r\nhe had really blushed for shame, but that could not be perceived,\r\nbecause his cheeks were covered with hair.\r\n\r\nThen breakfast followed, and during this meal Kali recounted his\r\nadventures, and Stasch translated them into English for Nell, who did\r\nnot understand the Ki-swahili language. It so happened that the buffalo\r\nhad run very far off, and it had been difficult for Kali to find his\r\ntrail, for there was no moon that night. As good luck would have it, it\r\nhad rained two days before, and the earth was not very hard; therefore\r\nthe feet of the heavy animal had made their impress in the wet earth.\r\nKali searched for the trail by observing the cleft in the hoofs, and\r\nfollowed his footprints for some time. At last the buffalo stumbled and\r\nmust have fallen over dead, for there were no traces of a struggle\r\nbetween him and Saba. When Kali found them Saba had already eaten the\r\nlargest part of one of his forefeet, but although he could not eat any\r\nmore himself, he would not permit two hyenas and several jackals, that\r\nstood round and waited until the stronger animal of prey had had his\r\nfill and gone away, to approach the meat.\r\n\r\nThe boy complained that the dog had even growled at him, but then he\r\nthreatened him with the displeasure of the “Great Man” and “Bibi,”\r\ncaught him by the collar, dragged him away from the buffalo, and did not\r\nlet him loose until he reached the gorge.\r\n\r\nWith this, the story of Kali’s adventures by night ended, then they all\r\nmounted their horses and rode on contentedly.\r\n\r\nAll but the long-legged Mea, who, although quiet and submissive, looked\r\nenviously at the necklace adorning the throat of the young negro and on\r\nSaba’s collar, and thought sadly to herself:\r\n\r\n“They are both ‘Great World,’ but I have only a ring on one foot.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDuring the three following days they continually traveled through the\r\ngorge and, as it so happened, always up hill. The days were unusually\r\nwarm, the nights alternately cold and sultry. The rainy season was\r\napproaching; here and there milk-white clouds heavy with rain hung low\r\ndown close to the horizon. Occasionally strips of rain could be seen,\r\nand far off was a rainbow. On the morning of the third day one of these\r\nclouds burst over their heads like a broken cask whose hoops had sprung\r\nand deluged them with warm rain, but as good luck would have it, it did\r\nnot last long, and then the weather was fine once more, and they were\r\nable to continue their journey. Now birds appeared in such quantities\r\nthat Stasch could shoot and bring down five of them without dismounting,\r\nwhich more than sufficed for one meal and also enough for Saba. Riding\r\nin the brisk air was not at all fatiguing, and a quantity of wild game\r\nand plenty of water removed all fear of hunger and thirst. They were\r\ngetting along so well that Stasch was always good-natured, and while\r\nriding by the side of the girl he talked cheerfully with her, and even\r\njoked occasionally.\r\n\r\n“Nell, do you know,” said he, as they halted for a short time under a\r\nbig breadfruit tree, from which Kali and Mea cut off large melon-shaped\r\nfruits, “it sometimes seems to me as though I were a wandering knight.”\r\n\r\n“And what is a wandering knight?” asked Nell, turning her pretty little\r\nface toward him:\r\n\r\n“A long, long time ago, in the Middle Ages, there were such knights, who\r\nrode about the country looking for adventures. They fought with giants\r\nand dragons—and do you know each one had his lady, whom he protected\r\nand defended.”\r\n\r\n“And am I such a lady?”\r\n\r\nStasch thought a moment and then answered:\r\n\r\n“No; you are too young for that. Those ladies were grown up——”\r\n\r\nAnd the idea never struck him that perhaps never had wandering knight\r\never served lady so faithfully as he had his little sister. He took\r\neverything that he had done for her as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nBut Nell felt hurt by his words, and screwing up her mouth into a pout,\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n“You once told me in the desert that I acted like a big girl of\r\nthirteen. Ah!”\r\n\r\n“Only once; but you are merely eight years old.”\r\n\r\n“But in ten years I shall be eighteen.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that is a great while off, and then I shall be twenty-four, but at\r\nthat age a man does not think about any lady, for he has something quite\r\ndifferent to think of then; that is very evident.”\r\n\r\n“And what are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“By that time I shall be an engineer or a mariner, or, if war were to\r\nbreak out in Poland, I should travel there, to fight as my father\r\nfought.”\r\n\r\nThen she asked uneasily:\r\n\r\n“But will you positively return to Port Said?”\r\n\r\n“For the present we both must return there.”\r\n\r\n“To our little papa,” sighed the girl.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately her eyes were veiled by sadness and homesickness. As\r\ngood luck would have it, a swarm of beautiful gray parrots, with pink\r\nheads and rose-colored down under their wings, flew toward them. The\r\nchildren immediately forgot what they had been talking about, and their\r\neyes followed the flight of the birds.\r\n\r\nThe flock of parrots flew over a group of Euphorbia and came down upon a\r\nneighboring sycamore, through the branches of which could be heard\r\nvoices that sounded like a chattering council, or a terrible quarrel.\r\n\r\n“These are the parrots that learn to speak the most readily,” said\r\nStasch. “As soon as we make a longer halt I will do my best to try to\r\ncatch one for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Stasch, I thank you,” cried Nell joyfully. “I will call him\r\n‘Daisy.’ ”\r\n\r\nMea and Kali, who meanwhile had been plucking the fruit from a\r\nbreadfruit tree, now loaded up the horses with them, and the little\r\ncaravan continued on its way.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon it clouded over again, and several times there was a\r\nshort shower that filled all the crevices in the ground with water. Kali\r\nprophesied a heavy storm, and it occurred to Stasch that in this case\r\nthe gorge, which had become narrower and narrower, would not be a safe\r\nresting-place for the night, as it would most likely become the bed of\r\nthe stream. So he decided to spend the night above the gorge, and Nell\r\nwas delighted at this, especially when Kali, who had been sent out to\r\nreconnoiter, returned, announcing that not far from where they were was\r\na forest of many kinds of trees, in which little monkeys were disporting\r\nthemselves; but these monkeys were not ugly and vicious as those they\r\nhad seen before. Therefore as soon as they struck a place where the\r\nwalls of the cliff were low and not too steep they led the horses up,\r\nand when it was dark they prepared for night. Nell’s tent was put up in\r\na somewhat higher and drier place underneath a large ant-hill, which\r\ncompletely barred the entrance from one side and strengthened the hedge\r\nthat led toward it.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity stood an enormous tree with wide-spreading branches and\r\nheavy foliage, which would shelter them sufficiently from the rain. In\r\nfront of the hedge grew scattered groups of trees, and further off was a\r\ndense woods filled with underbrush, above which could be seen the tops\r\nof strange palms resembling giant fans spread out like the tail of a\r\npeacock.\r\n\r\nStasch learned from Kali that before the beginning of the second rainy\r\nseason—that is in autumn—it is dangerous to spend the night under\r\nthese palms, because the huge fruit ripens, breaks off when least\r\nexpected, and falls from its great height with such force that it might\r\nkill a human being, or even a horse. But at the present time the fruit\r\nhad not matured. Before the sun went down little monkeys could be seen\r\nin the distance scrambling and playfully chasing one another in the\r\ntree-tops.\r\n\r\nStasch and Kali collected a sufficient quantity of wood for the night,\r\nand as occasional heavy waves of hot air blew toward them, they fastened\r\ndown the hedge with pegs, which the young negro whittled with Gebhr’s\r\nsword, and drove into the ground. This precaution was very necessary,\r\nfor the strong wind might break and tear down the thorn branches out of\r\nwhich the hedge was made, and thus make it easy for wild animals to\r\nattack them.\r\n\r\nSoon after the sun went down the wind stopped suddenly, but on the other\r\nhand the air had become heavy and sultry. In the spaces between the\r\nclouds stars appeared occasionally, but later complete darkness settled\r\ndown, so that one could hardly see a foot in advance. The little\r\nwanderers grouped themselves around the fire and listened to the chatter\r\nand screams of the monkeys, which were making a perfect pandemonium. In\r\nthe neighboring woods the howls of the jackals and other strange\r\nsounds—through which could be heard the restlessness and the fear of\r\nthat which under the veil of darkness in the wilderness threatens every\r\nhuman being—united to form an appropriate accompaniment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the stillness became intense, and in the darkness the growl of\r\na lion was heard.\r\n\r\nThe horses, which were grazing nearby in the short jungle grass, began\r\nto approach the light of the fire by hopping with their chained front\r\nfeet, and even then the hair of Saba, who was usually so courageous,\r\nbristled, and he crouched in front of his master with his tail drawn\r\ndown, obviously seeking protection. The growl sounded again, this time\r\nas if coming from the bowels of the earth; it was a deep, heavy,\r\nlong-drawn sigh, as if the animal had let it out of its powerful lungs\r\nwith difficulty. The sound rolled on glidingly close to the ground,\r\nsometimes louder, sometimes softer, then becoming a deep, hollow,\r\nunearthly sigh.\r\n\r\n“Kali, put more wood on the fire,” cried Stasch.\r\n\r\nThe negro threw an armful of branches on the fire with such haste and\r\nforce that at first nothing but sparks ascended; then the flame blazed\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n“The lion will not attack us, will he, Stasch?” whispered Nell, pulling\r\nthe boy by the sleeve.\r\n\r\n“No, he will not attack us. Look how high the hedge is——”\r\n\r\nAs he said this he positively thought that they were in no danger, but\r\nstill he was worried about the horses, which pressed nearer and nearer\r\nthe hedge and threatened to tread it down.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sighing changed into a long-drawn-out thundering roar,\r\nenough to terrify any human being, for even creatures who know no fear\r\ntremble from head to foot, shaking like panes of glass at the report of\r\nfar-off cannon.\r\n\r\nStasch threw a hurried glance at Nell, and seeing her quivering mouth\r\nand moist eyes, he said:\r\n\r\n“Don’t be frightened. Don’t cry.”\r\n\r\nShe answered under a great strain:\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to cry, but my eyes perspire so—oh!”\r\n\r\nThe last scream escaped from her lips because at that moment a second\r\nroar, far more powerful and much nearer than the first, rang out from\r\nthe forest. The horses began to push themselves still nearer the hedge,\r\nand if the long, steel-like prickles of the acacia branches had not\r\nhindered them they would have broken through. Saba growled and trembled\r\nlike an ivy leaf, and Kali began to repeat in a broken voice:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  “A second roar, far more powerful and much nearer than\r\nthe first, rang out from the forest. The echoes filled the jungle,\r\nsaturating the darkness with thunder and fear.” ]\r\n\r\n“Sir! Two! Two! Two!”\r\n\r\nAs the lions were now responding to each other, they continued to roar,\r\nand this awful concert kept up for some time in the darkness, for as\r\nsoon as one of the animals ceased the other began. Stasch was unable to\r\ndistinguish from what direction their voices came, for the echoes\r\nrepeated them over and over in the gorge and reverberated from cliff to\r\ncliff, sounded above and beneath, filled the forest and the jungle,\r\nsaturating the darkness with thunder and with fear.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing seemed to the boy to be quite certain, and that was that\r\nthe beasts were surely approaching. Kali also noticed that the lions\r\nwere creeping round the bivouac, approaching in smaller circles, and he\r\nalso noticed that, being kept from attacking them by the fire, they were\r\nexpressing their displeasure and fear by emitting these dreadful sounds.\r\n\r\nHe also seemed to think that only the horses were in danger, for he\r\nsaid, as he counted on his fingers:\r\n\r\n“The lions will kill one, two; not all, not all!”\r\n\r\n“Throw wood on the fire,” repeated Stasch.\r\n\r\nAgain a bigger flame burst forth, and suddenly the roars ceased. But\r\nKali raised his head and began to listen.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Rain——” answered the negro.\r\n\r\nNow Stasch also pricked up his ears. The branches of the trees served as\r\na roof for the tent, and also for the entire hedge, and therefore not a\r\nsingle drop fell to the ground, but it could be heard pattering on the\r\nleaves above them.\r\n\r\nAs there was not a breath of even the sultry air stirring, it was easy\r\nto conjecture that it was pouring in the thicket.\r\n\r\nThe sound increased moment by moment, and after a little while the\r\nchildren perceived drops descending from the leaves, drops of rain that\r\nlooked like large rosy pearls in the firelight. As Kali had prophesied,\r\na terrific storm had come up. The sound of the storm increased until it\r\nbecame a wild roar. Rain fell faster and faster, and at last great\r\nstreams of water penetrated the thicket. The fire was going out. Kali\r\nthrew on fagots to no effect. The wet branches only smoldered, the\r\nblackened wood beneath crackled, and after a feeble flicker the flames\r\ndied away.\r\n\r\n“Though the pelting rain drown the fire, the hedge will still protect\r\nus,” said Stasch to calm Nell.\r\n\r\nThen he led the little girl within the tent and covered her with a\r\nshawl, after which he went out again at once, for he heard a short roar.\r\nThis time it seemed much nearer, and in it there was a note of triumph.\r\n\r\nEvery second the storm increased. The raindrops pelted the foliage like\r\nshot. Had not the fire been protected by the branches it would have gone\r\nout at once, but soon there arose only heavy smoke, through which narrow\r\nblue flames shot up here and there. Kali thought that the fire was about\r\nout, and so did not throw any more fagots on it. Instead, he quickly\r\nswung a rope round the tree, and with its aid soon climbed higher and\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Kali climbs up the tree.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” he screamed, angry at the boy’s selfishness.\r\n\r\nA vivid flash of lightning shot through the darkness, and Kali’s answer\r\nwas drowned by a clap of thunder which shook the heavens and the\r\nwilderness. At the same time a hurricane broke forth that tore the\r\nbranches off the trees and in a second swept over the place where the\r\nfire had been and carried away the glowing pieces of wood which remained\r\nunder the ashes, and flung them, like fiery, sparkling sheafs, into the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nThe next moment an impenetrable darkness enveloped the camp. The\r\nterrible equatorial storm raged in the heavens and on the earth. Claps\r\nof thunder and flashes of lightning followed one another in rapid\r\nsuccession. The vivid forks of lightning tore wildly through the\r\nsomberness of the black sky. On the nearby cliff a strange-looking blue\r\nball was seen; for a time it rolled along the gorge, then flamed up into\r\ndazzling brilliancy, exploding with such a terrible report that it\r\nseemed as if the very rocks must be crushed to powder by the shock.\r\nThen, as before, perfect silence reigned.\r\n\r\nStasch was worried on Nell’s account, and he groped his way toward the\r\ntent, which was still standing, being protected by the ant-hill and the\r\nimmense tree trunk; nevertheless the next gust of wind might be heavier\r\nand break the ropes and carry it away, heaven knows where. The storm\r\nabated at times, then increased, and rivers of rain and masses of broken\r\ntwigs, branches, and foliage from the neighboring woods came thundering\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nStasch was nearly at his wits’ end. He did not know whether he ought to\r\nleave Nell in the tent or take her out. In the first case she might\r\nbecome entangled in the ropes and be carried off with the tent-canvas;\r\non the other hand, she stood a chance of getting thoroughly drenched and\r\nbeing carried away in addition, for even Stasch, though much stronger\r\nthan she, was scarcely able to keep his own footing.\r\n\r\nThis desperate situation was at last solved by the whirlwind, which soon\r\ncarried off the top of the tent, and now the canvas walls offered no\r\nfurther protection. There was nothing to do but to wait in the\r\nimpenetrable darkness, surrounded by two lions, for the storm to abate.\r\n\r\nStasch thought that perhaps these animals had also sought shelter from\r\nthe storm in the nearby forest, but he was quite sure that they would\r\nreturn after the rain had ceased, and the awful predicament was made\r\nworse by the fact that the hurricane had also demolished the hedge.\r\n\r\nEverything threatened destruction. Stasch’s rifle was useless, and he\r\nhad no scope for his energy. Face to face with the storm, the lightning,\r\nthe tempest, the rain, the darkness, and the lions, he felt himself\r\ndefenseless, helpless. The canvas walls, beaten by the hurricane,\r\ndrenched them on all sides, so Stasch threw his arm around Nell and\r\nguided her outside the tent; then they both clung to the tree trunk and\r\nthere waited either death or the merciful help of heaven.\r\n\r\nBut now suddenly between the blasts of wind came the voice of Kali,\r\nwhich could scarcely be heard above the pattering of the rain.\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah! Up the tree! Up the tree!”\r\n\r\nAnd immediately a wet rope let down from above touched the boy’s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“Fasten Bibi to it. Kali will draw her up!” cried the negro again.\r\n\r\nStasch did not hesitate a minute. He rolled Nell up in the canvas, so\r\nthat the rope could not cut her, bound it tightly round her body, lifted\r\nher up with outstretched arms, and cried, “Pull!”\r\n\r\nThere happened to be some low branches on the tree, so Nell’s journey\r\nthrough the air was not long. Kali soon caught her in his strong arms\r\nand deposited her between the tree trunk and an enormous branch, which\r\nwas roomy enough for half a dozen more such tiny beings as she. No blast\r\nof wind could blow her down from the tree, and although the water ran\r\ndown the tree in a stream, the trunk, which was more than ten feet\r\nthick, protected her at least from those sheets of water which the\r\ntempest drove obliquely toward them.\r\n\r\nAfter the negro had brought the little “Bibi” to this place of safety,\r\nhe let the rope down for Stasch, but he, like a captain who is the last\r\nto leave his sinking ship, ordered Mea to climb up before him.\r\n\r\nKali’s help was unnecessary, for she swung herself up in a minute with\r\nskill and agility, as though she were the sister of a chimpanzee. It was\r\na more difficult feat for Stasch, but still he was sufficiently trained\r\nin gymnastics to overcome the weight of his own body, which was\r\nincreased by the rifle and the cartridges, with which he had hastily\r\nfilled his pockets.\r\n\r\nIn a short time they were all in the tree. Stasch had become so\r\naccustomed to think always of Nell first, that he now set about at once\r\nto see that she stood in no danger of falling off, ascertaining if she\r\nhad room enough, and whether she could lie down comfortably. Satisfied\r\nin these respects, he began racking his brains as to how he could\r\nshelter her from the storm. But there was not much hope that he would be\r\nsuccessful in this. To erect a small roof over their heads would have\r\nbeen easy work during the day, but now the darkness surrounding them was\r\nso intense that they could not even see each other. If the storm would\r\nonly abate they could light a fire to dry Nell’s clothes.\r\n\r\nStasch was in despair, thinking that the child, who was drenched to the\r\nskin, would surely have her first attack of fever the following day. He\r\nwas afraid that it might be cold in the early morning after the storm,\r\nas had been the case after the previous nights, though the blasts of\r\nwind and the rain during the other storms had been warm. Stasch was only\r\nsurprised at its duration, for he knew that equatorial storms are the\r\nfiercer in proportion to their speed in passing. It was a long time\r\nbefore the thunder ceased and the wind calmed down a little, but even\r\nthen it continued to rain, not so heavily as before, but still the\r\nraindrops were so heavy and dense that the foliage offered absolutely no\r\nshelter. From beneath them could be heard the roaring of waters, as if\r\nthe whole jungle were converted into a sea. Stasch shuddered, thinking\r\nthat they would surely be destroyed in the gorge. He also thought of\r\nwhat might have happened to Saba, and this made him very sad, but he did\r\nnot dare to talk about the dog to Nell. He cherished a fond hope that\r\nthe clever animal had found a safe refuge between the rocks that\r\noverhung the gorge. At any rate, it was impossible for him to help the\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nAnd so they sat there close to one another, becoming wetter and wetter\r\nunder the outspread branches, and waiting for dawn. After a few hours\r\nthe air began to cool off and at last the rain stopped entirely. To all\r\nappearances the water now only flowed over the edge of the promontories\r\ndown into the lower regions, for no splashing or hollow roaring could be\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nOn the previous day Stasch noticed that Kali had attempted to make a\r\nfire with wet branches and the idea suddenly struck him of ordering the\r\nnegro to descend and try if he could do it again. But just as he turned\r\ntoward him something happened which nearly froze the blood in the veins\r\nof all four.\r\n\r\nA terrible, heartrending cry from the horses—a cry full of pain,\r\nsurprise, and deadly fear—broke the silence of the night. Through the\r\ndarkness were heard frightful sounds, then a short gurgling, followed by\r\nhollow sighs and groans, and at the very end a piercing, inexpressible\r\nsound, and then silence reigned.\r\n\r\n“The lions! Lions kill horses!” whispered Kali.\r\n\r\nThere was something so terrible in this attack by night, in the violence\r\nof the elements, and in the sudden killing of the animals, that for a\r\nminute Stasch’s blood nearly froze in his veins and he never once\r\nthought of the rifle. But what good would it do to shoot in such\r\ndarkness? At best the nocturnal marauders, frightened by the light and\r\nthe report of the shots, would leave the dead horses, follow those who\r\nhad wandered away from the camping place as far as their bound feet\r\nwould permit, and would then run away.\r\n\r\nAt the thought of what really might have happened had they stayed below,\r\nStasch began to shudder. Nell, clinging to him, trembled as if seized by\r\nher first attack of fever. However, the tree protected them from being\r\nattacked. Doubtless it was Kali who had saved their lives.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all, however, it was a terrible night, by far the most awful\r\nof the entire journey.\r\n\r\nThey crouched on the branches like drenched birds, and listened to what\r\nwas going on below. For a while deep silence reigned, then again there\r\nwere sounds denoting the tearing of large pieces of meat, the greedy\r\nsmacking of lips, the gasping breath and the groans of the monsters.\r\n\r\nThe scent of raw meat and blood penetrated into the top of the tree, for\r\nthe lions held their feast not further than twenty feet away from the\r\nhedge. They feasted so long that Stasch lost patience and became angry,\r\nand he took up the rifle and shot in the direction from which the noises\r\ncame. A short, broken-off, angry roar was the only answer. Then once\r\nmore was heard the cracking of the bones, which the animals of prey\r\ncrunched between their enormous jaws. In the background the blue and red\r\neyes of the hyenas and jackals glistened as they awaited their turn.\r\n\r\nAnd so the endless hours of the night dragged on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAt last the sun rose and lighted up the jungle, the scattered groves,\r\nand the forest. The lions disappeared with the first ray of dawn. Stasch\r\nmade Kali build a fire and ordered Mea to take Nell’s things out of the\r\nleather bag, in which they were packed, to dry them and change the\r\ngirl’s clothes as quickly as possible. He took the rifle and carefully\r\nwent over the camp to see what ravages had been made by the storm and\r\nthe bloodthirsty beasts.\r\n\r\nJust behind the hedge, only the stakes of which remained, lay the first\r\nhorse, nearly half devoured; some hundred feet further, a second, hardly\r\nbegun; and next to it the third, with its stomach torn open and its head\r\nsmashed in. They all presented a terrible sight, for in their open,\r\nglassy eyes could be seen their terror at approaching death, and their\r\nwide-open jaws displayed their strong teeth. The ground was stamped down\r\nand the cavities formed pools of blood. Stasch was so enraged that at\r\nthe moment he almost wished that the disheveled head of one of the\r\nnocturnal robbers, tired out after the feast, would appear behind one of\r\nthe bushes, so that he might send a bullet through it. But he was\r\nobliged to postpone his revenge at present, for he had other things to\r\nattend to.\r\n\r\nThe remaining horses had to be caught. The boy supposed that like Saba,\r\nwhose carcass was nowhere to be seen, they might have hidden somewhere\r\nin the woods. The hope that the faithful fellow-sufferer had not fallen\r\na prey to the wild animals made Stasch feel so happy that he took\r\ncourage once more, and the finding of the donkey naturally increased his\r\njoy. It so happened that clever longears had not even taken the trouble\r\nto run far away. He had simply crept into a nook made by the ant-hill\r\nand the large tree outside the hedge, and there, with head and sides\r\nprotected, he had awaited events, in readiness at any moment to repulse\r\nthe attack by vigorously kicking out his hind legs. But the lions had\r\napparently not noticed him, so when the sun rose and the danger was over\r\nhe felt the necessity of lying down and taking a good rest after all the\r\ntragical events of the night.\r\n\r\nWhile circling the camp Stasch at last found the impress of horses’\r\nhoofs in the moistened earth. The tracks pointed toward the woods and\r\nthen turned off toward the gorge. That was fortunate, for it would not\r\nbe difficult to capture horses in the narrow pass. A little further on\r\nin the grass was found a foot-chain, which one of the horses had\r\nsucceeded in breaking off during its flight. This horse must have run\r\naway so far that for the present he would have to be considered lost. To\r\noffset this, Stasch discovered the other two behind a low rock, not in\r\nthe ravine, but on its borders. One of them was rolling on the ground,\r\nthe other grazing in the fresh green grass. Both looked very tired, as\r\nthough they had run a long distance. But daylight had driven all fear\r\nfrom their hearts, and they greeted Stasch by neighing in a short,\r\nfriendly way. The horse which was rolling on the ground sprang to his\r\nfeet, which enabled the boy to see that he also had succeeded in\r\nbreaking loose from his foot-chains, but fortunately he had preferred\r\nremaining with his friend to running away aimlessly.\r\n\r\nStasch left both of them under the cliff and advanced to the edge of the\r\nravine to make sure whether it were possible to continue the journey. He\r\nnow saw that the heavy downpour had been so severe that the rain had run\r\noff and the ground was nearly dry. And soon his attention was attracted\r\nby a grayish-white article, which had been caught in the vines\r\noverhanging the opposite side of the cliff. This proved to be the roof\r\nof the tent, which had been blown off and caught on the bushes; it had\r\ntaken such a strong hold that the rain could not wash it away. After\r\nall, the tent offered a better shelter for Nell than the hut made of\r\nbranches of trees put together hastily, and Stasch was much pleased at\r\nfinding this article, which he had thought was lost.\r\n\r\nNow his joy increased when out of a higher crevice in the cliff hidden\r\nby lianas Saba came running toward him, holding in his teeth an animal\r\nwhose head and tail hung out of either side of his jaws. The huge dog\r\nclimbed down in a minute and laid at Stasch’s feet a striped hyena, with\r\nbroken back and one foot bitten off; then he began to wag his tail and\r\nto bark cheerfully as if to say: “I must acknowledge that I took to my\r\nheels before the lion, but even you crouched like birds on the tree. And\r\nbesides, you see, I have not passed the night without accomplishing\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\nAnd he was so proud of himself that Stasch scarcely liked to make him\r\nleave the ill-smelling carcass behind, instead of bringing it to Nell.\r\n\r\nWhen they both returned they found a large fire in the bivouac, water\r\nboiling in the pots, and the meal being cooked. Nell had put on dry\r\nclothing, but she looked so pale and ill that Stasch was startled and\r\ntook her hand, to make sure whether or not she was feverish.\r\n\r\n“Nell, what is the matter?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Stasch; I am only very sleepy.”\r\n\r\n“I believe it, after such a night! Thank goodness, you have cold hands.\r\nOh, what a night that was! Of course you must be sleepy—I am sleepy,\r\ntoo. But don’t you feel well?”\r\n\r\n“I have a slight headache.”\r\n\r\nStasch laid his hand on her forehead. The little head was cold like the\r\nhands, but that was a sign of unusual exhaustion and weakness, and so\r\nthe boy sighed and said:\r\n\r\n“You must now have something hot to eat, and then you must lie down and\r\nsleep until evening. At least the weather is good to-day, and not likely\r\nto be as it was yesterday.”\r\n\r\nBut Nell gazed at him with terror.\r\n\r\n“We surely are not going to spend the night here?”\r\n\r\n“Not here, for the mangled horses are lying nearby; we will look for\r\nsome other tree, or else ride down into the gorge and build a better\r\nfence than any in the world. You will sleep as quietly as at Port Said.”\r\n\r\nBut she folded her tiny hands and with tears in her eyes besought him to\r\nride on at once, for she said that in this awful place it would be\r\nimpossible for her to close her eyes and she would surely get sick.\r\n\r\nShe begged so earnestly, and as she looked into his eyes repeated over\r\nand over again, “Stasch, please!” that at last he consented to do as she\r\nwished.\r\n\r\n“Then we will attempt to continue our journey through the gorge,” said\r\nhe, “for there it is shady. Only promise to tell me when your strength\r\ngives out or when you feel weak.”\r\n\r\n“It will not come to that! You can bind me to the saddle and I shall\r\nhave a good sleep.”\r\n\r\n“No. I shall ride on the same horse with you. Kali and Mea will ride on\r\nthe others, and the donkey will carry the tent and the luggage.”\r\n\r\n“Good! Good!”\r\n\r\n“But as soon as breakfast is over you must take a little nap. Besides,\r\nwe can not start before noon, as there are many things to be done. The\r\nhorses must be caught, the tent folded, and the baggage repacked. We\r\nshall have to leave some things behind, for we have only two horses\r\nleft. It will take a few hours to do all these things, and in the\r\nmeantime you will have a good sleep and feel stronger. It is going to be\r\na very warm day, but under the tree it will be shady.”\r\n\r\n“And you—and Mea and Kali? I am so ashamed to be the only one to sleep\r\nwhile you all have so much anxiety——”\r\n\r\n“Never mind; after a while we can sleep. Don’t be worried on my account.\r\nWhen in Port Said I frequently, during my examinations, passed entire\r\nnights without sleep, but of course my father did not know it. My\r\nfriends took no rest either. But what a man can stand is of course out\r\nof the question for a little fly like you. You have no idea how badly\r\nyou look to-day—as frail as glass. Your eyes and hair are all that\r\nremain, and there is nothing left of your face.”\r\n\r\nAlthough he said this jokingly, in his heart he was frightened, for in\r\nbroad daylight Nell really looked ill, and for the first time it\r\noccurred to him that the poor child, if she continued to look like this,\r\nnot only might die, but was sure to die. At this thought his knees\r\ntrembled, for he suddenly felt that in case of her death he would have\r\nno reason to live or to return to Port Said.\r\n\r\n“For what would there be in life for me?” he continually thought.\r\n\r\nHe turned away for a minute, so that Nell should not see the look of\r\nsadness and fear in his eyes, and then he went to the baggage, which was\r\npiled up under the tree, took off the cloth which covered the\r\ncartridge-case, opened it, and began to search for something.\r\n\r\nIt was there, in a little glass phial, that he kept the last quinine\r\npowder and guarded it as the apple of his eye for a “dark hour”; that\r\nis, in case Nell should take the fever. But now it was almost certain\r\nthat after such a night the first attack would come on, and so he\r\ndecided to take precautions against it. This he did with a heavy heart,\r\nthinking of what might follow—and if he had not felt the impropriety of\r\na man and leader of a caravan weeping, he would surely have dissolved\r\ninto tears on parting with his last powder.\r\n\r\nIn order to hide his emotion he assumed a stern look, turned to the\r\ngirl, and said:\r\n\r\n“Nell, I want you to take the rest of the quinine before you eat.”\r\n\r\n“And if you get the fever?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Then I will shake myself. Take it, I say.”\r\n\r\nShe took it without further resistance; for since he had shot the\r\nSudanese she was a little afraid of him, notwithstanding the attention\r\nand kindness he showed her. Then they all sat down to breakfast; and\r\nafter the toils of the night thoroughly enjoyed a plate of good soup.\r\nNell fell asleep as soon as the meal was finished and slept some hours.\r\nMeanwhile Stasch, Kali, and Mea prepared the caravan for the journey,\r\nbrought the top part of the tent from the ravine, saddled the horses,\r\nput the pack on the donkey, and hid under the roots of shrubs everything\r\nthey were unable to take with them. They were almost overcome with sleep\r\nwhile performing these duties, so Stasch arranged that they should take\r\nturns in having a short nap, fearing that otherwise they might go to\r\nsleep during the journey.\r\n\r\nIt was about two o’clock when they set out again. Stasch held Nell in\r\nfront of him on the saddle and Kali rode with Mea on the second horse.\r\nThey did not ride straight into the gorge, but kept between its upper\r\nside and the forest. The new jungle had grown considerably during this\r\nlast night of rain, but the ground under the new grass was black and\r\nstill bore traces of fire. It was easy to surmise that either Smain had\r\npassed that way with his men, or that a fire, caused by lightning, had\r\nswept over the dried jungle, and, having at last struck the wet forest,\r\nhad wound itself through the rather narrow course between it and the\r\nravine. Therefore Stasch tried to see whether traces of Smain’s\r\nencampment or imprints of his horses’ hoofs could be found on this\r\nroute, and to his great joy he was convinced that nothing of the kind\r\nwas to be seen. Kali, who understood such things, insisted that the fire\r\nmust have been driven there by the wind more than ten days ago.\r\n\r\n“That proves,” said Stasch, “that Smain is already heaven knows where\r\nwith his Mahdists—and that we can not possibly fall into his hands.”\r\n\r\nHe and Nell now began to look at the vegetation with some curiosity, for\r\nthey had never been in a tropical forest before. They rode along close\r\nto the edge, so as to be in the shade. The ground was damp and soft, and\r\ncovered with dark green grass, moss, and ferns. Here and there lay old\r\nrotten tree-trunks covered with a carpet of beautiful orchids,[17] with\r\ncups colored like variegated butterflies in the center of their buds.\r\nWherever the sun shone the earth glittered with other strange tiny\r\norchids,[18] whose two petals, rising from a third petal, remind one of\r\nthe head of a small animal with pointed ears. In many places the forest\r\nconsisted of the shrubs of wild jasmine,[19] forming garlands of thin,\r\npink-colored tendrils. The wet paths and crevices were covered with\r\nferns, forming an impenetrable thicket. This underbrush was low in some\r\nplaces, broad in others, and sometimes it grew tall and was encircled by\r\na kind of safflower, which in that case reached to the lowest branches\r\nof the tree, giving an effect of fine green lace. In the interior of the\r\nwoods there were different kinds of trees. Date and bread trees, fan\r\npalms, sycamores, large varieties of groundsel, acacias, trees with\r\ndark, shining, bright blood-red foliage grew close together, stem to\r\nstem, with branches and twigs from which yellow and purple flowers shot\r\nforth like torches. In many places the tree-trunks were completely\r\nhidden, being covered from head to foot with creepers, which swayed from\r\none branch to the other, forming the capital letters “W” and “M,” and\r\nresembling festoons, curtains, or portières. India-rubber lianas[20]\r\nnearly smothered the trees with their thousands of tendrils, and turned\r\nthem into pyramids clothed in white flowers. Small lianas wound\r\nthemselves round the larger ones, and the jungle was in some places so\r\nthickly matted that it almost formed a barrier through which neither\r\nhuman being nor animal could penetrate. Only here and there, in places\r\nwhere elephants, whose strength nothing can withstand, had forced a\r\npassage, were there gaps in the thicket, which looked like deep, winding\r\ncorridors. The song of the birds, which make the European forests so\r\ncharming, was absolutely lacking. On the other hand, there came from the\r\ntops of the trees the most peculiar sounds, resembling at times the\r\nsharp scraping of a saw, the hollow beating of pots and pans, the\r\nchattering of storks, the squeaking of an old rusty door, the clapping\r\nof hands, the mewing of cats, and even the loud and animated\r\nconversation of human beings. From time to time a swarm of gray, green,\r\nor white parrots or a multitude of colored pepper-eaters, with their\r\ngliding, wave-like motion, swung themselves in the trees. On the\r\nsnow-white background of the india-rubber vines there sometimes crept\r\nlike forest spirits little monkeys in mourning, perfectly black, with\r\nthe exception of their white tails, white stripes on their sides, and\r\nstrange-looking white whiskers encasing their coal-black faces.\r\n\r\nThe children gazed with admiration and surprise at the forest, which the\r\neyes of a white man had perhaps never seen before. Saba constantly ran\r\nunder the bushes and barked cheerfully. Little Nell felt strengthened by\r\nthe quinine, her breakfast, and her sleep. Her little face was fresh and\r\nsomewhat rosy, and her eyes had a happier expression. Every minute she\r\nasked Stasch the names of the various trees and birds, and he answered\r\nher as best he could. At last she said that she would like to get off\r\nthe horse and pick quantities of flowers.\r\n\r\nBut the boy smiled and said:\r\n\r\n“The ‘siafus’ would eat you up in a minute.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that—‘siafus’? Is that something worse than a lion?”\r\n\r\n“Worse and still not worse. They are ants that bite fearfully. The\r\nbranches are covered with them, and they fall like a shower of fire from\r\nthe trees and alight on one’s back. They crawl along the ground, too. If\r\nyou should try to get off your horse and go into the woods, you would\r\nsoon begin to hop about and scream like a little monkey. One might more\r\neasily protect one’s self from a lion. Sometimes they come in large\r\nswarms, and then everything gives way before them.”\r\n\r\n“But you could surely prevent them doing you any harm!”\r\n\r\n“I? Why certainly I could.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“With fire or boiling water.”\r\n\r\n“You always know how to defend yourself,” she said, thoroughly\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\nStasch felt very much flattered at these words, and so answered in a\r\ncheerful voice:\r\n\r\n“If you only keep well you can rely on me for the rest.”\r\n\r\n“I have not even a headache now.”\r\n\r\n“Thank heaven! Thank heaven!”\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation they were riding on the border of the forest,\r\nwhich was only divided from the narrow pass by a hedge. The sun was\r\nstill high in the heavens, and its scorching rays beat down on them, for\r\nthe weather was fine, and there was not a cloud above the horizon. The\r\nhorses were sweating profusely, and Nell began to complain of the heat.\r\nAnd so Stasch, seeing a suitable place, turned into the gorge, the west\r\nside of which was now completely shady. The water still left in the\r\nhollows after the storm of the previous day was now fairly cold. Over\r\nthe heads of the little wanderers there continually flew—from one side\r\nof the gorge to the other—pepper-eaters with purple heads, blue\r\nbreasts, and yellow wings, and the boy began to tell Nell what he had\r\nread in books about their habits.\r\n\r\n“You know,” he said, “there are pepper-eaters which, in the brooding\r\nseason, find a cavity in a tree, and the female then carries the eggs\r\nthere and sets on them, and the male closes the opening with clay so\r\nthat only the head of the female is visible, and not until the young\r\nones are hatched does he break the wall of clay with his large beak and\r\ngive the female her liberty again.”\r\n\r\n“And what does she have to eat all this time?”\r\n\r\n“The male feeds her. He flies about constantly and brings her various\r\nkinds of berries.”\r\n\r\n“And is she allowed to sleep?” asked Nell in a sleepy voice.\r\n\r\nStasch smiled.\r\n\r\n“If Mrs. Pepper-eater is as sleepy as you are, then the male permits her\r\nto go to sleep.”\r\n\r\nIn the coolness of the gorge the girl was suddenly overcome by\r\ndrowsiness, for her nap that morning had been too short, and she needed\r\nmore sleep. In fact, Stasch really had a great mind to follow her\r\nexample, but could not, because he had to hold fast to her for fear she\r\nmight fall, and besides he was very uncomfortably seated, riding astride\r\non the broad, flat saddle which Hatim and Seki Tamala had made in\r\nFashoda for the little girl. He hardly dared move, and he guided the\r\nhorse as slowly as possible so as not to wake her up.\r\n\r\nAnd she leaned back, laid her small head on his shoulder, and fell sound\r\nasleep. But she breathed so quietly and evenly that Stasch did not\r\nregret having given her the last small quinine powder. On hearing her\r\ndeep breathing he felt that for the present the danger of fever was\r\nover, and he began to make the following observations:\r\n\r\n“The bed of the gorge leads continually up hill, and just at this\r\nparticular spot it is rather steep. We have climbed higher and higher,\r\nand the ground is much drier than below. We must now search for a high\r\nand well-sheltered place near a rapid stream, and settle down there,\r\ngive the little one a few weeks in which to recover, and perhaps we\r\nshall be obliged to wait until the ‘massika’[21] is over. Few girls\r\nwould have borne up under a tenth part of these trials, and she must\r\ntake a good rest. After a night such as we have passed through any other\r\ngirl would have come right down with the fever, but she—how soundly she\r\nsleeps! Thank God!”\r\n\r\nThese thoughts encouraged him, but though he spoke cheerfully to himself\r\nwhile gazing on Nell’s head reposing on his shoulder, he was also\r\nsurprised at his emotions.\r\n\r\n“It really is strange how fond I am of this little one. I have always\r\nbeen fond of her, but now I care more and more.”\r\n\r\nAnd as he did not know how to account for this he reflected as follows:\r\n\r\n“This is probably due to the fact that we have undergone so many dangers\r\ntogether, and also because she happens to be in my care.”\r\n\r\nWhile meditating thus he held the child very carefully, with his right\r\nhand in her belt, so that she could not fall out of the saddle. They\r\nrode on slowly and silently, and Kali whispered in Stasch’s ear these\r\nflattering words:\r\n\r\n“The Great Man kills Gebhr, kills lion, and buffalo. Yah! Yah! The Great\r\nMan will kill many lions. Plenty of meat! Plenty of meat! Yah! Yah!”\r\n\r\n“Kali,” asked Stasch softly, “do the Wa-himas hunt lions, too?”\r\n\r\n“Wa-hima afraid of lions, but Wa-hima dig deep trenches, and if a lion\r\nfalls into them during the night, why then Wa-hima laughs.”\r\n\r\n“What would you do then?”\r\n\r\n“Wa-hima throw many spears until the lion like a porcupine, then drag\r\nhim out of the trench and eat him. Lion good.” And, as was his custom,\r\nhe stroked his stomach.\r\n\r\nThis way of killing lions did not appeal strongly to Stasch, so he began\r\nto question Kali as to what other kind of game was to be found in the\r\nland of the Wa-hima; and so they talked more about antelopes, ostriches,\r\ngiraffes, and rhinoceroses until they heard the splashing of a\r\nwaterfall.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” cried Stasch. “In front of us is a stream and a\r\nwaterfall, too!”\r\n\r\nKali nodded his head as a sign that it was really so.\r\n\r\nFor a time they rode on, quickening their pace and listening intently to\r\nthe rushing of the water, which was heard more distinctly every minute.\r\n\r\n“A waterfall!” repeated Stasch, who was much interested. But they had\r\nscarcely passed through one or two bends in the gorge when they suddenly\r\nperceived an insurmountable obstacle lying across their path.\r\n\r\nNell, who had been lulled to sleep by the regular motion of the horse,\r\nawoke at once.\r\n\r\n“Are we stopping to put up here for the night?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“No; but look!” answered Stasch. “See, a rock is lying across the\r\ngorge!”\r\n\r\n“What can we do?”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible to creep alongside of the rock, for it is very narrow\r\njust here, and so we must turn back a little way and try to climb to the\r\ntop and go around it; but as there are still two hours before night-fall\r\nwe have plenty of time, and this will give the horses a chance to get\r\ntheir wind. Do you hear the waterfall?”\r\n\r\n“I hear it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s where we’ll halt for the night.”\r\n\r\nHe then turned to Kali and ordered him to climb up the side of the\r\nnarrow pass to see whether the bottom of the gorge was blocked with more\r\nobstacles. As for Stasch, he began to inspect the rock very carefully,\r\nand after a while he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“It must have broken off and fallen down here very recently. Do you see\r\nwhere it has broken off, Nell? See how fresh the break is. There is not\r\neven moss or in fact any other kind of plant to be seen on it. I\r\nunderstand now—I understand!”\r\n\r\nAnd with his hand he pointed to a baobab-tree growing on the side of the\r\nravine, its enormous roots hanging down over the side of the cliff where\r\nthe rock had broken off.\r\n\r\n“This root has forced its way through a crevice between the wall and the\r\nrock and has grown so long and so thick that it has split the rock off.\r\nThat seems strange, for stone is harder than wood, but I do know that\r\nsuch things happen in the mountains. A rock like this, which has\r\nscarcely any hold, breaks off at the least jar.”\r\n\r\n“But what could have jarred it so?”\r\n\r\n“That’s difficult to say. Perhaps a previous storm, perhaps yesterday’s\r\nrain.”\r\n\r\nSaba had remained behind the caravan, but now he came running up, as if\r\nsome one were pulling him back by the tail, sniffed, squeezed himself\r\nthrough the small passage between the hedge and the fallen rock, and\r\nthen immediately began to back out, his hair standing on end.\r\n\r\nStasch dismounted to see what had frightened the dog.\r\n\r\n“Stasch, don’t go,” begged Nell; “perhaps there is a lion there.”\r\n\r\nBut the boy, who loved to boast of his wonderful deeds, and who since\r\nthe events of the day before had been greatly enraged against lions,\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“That’s great! A lion—by day!”\r\n\r\nBut before he had time to approach the passage Kali’s voice was heard\r\nfrom above the gorge.\r\n\r\n“Bwana Kubwa! Bwana Kubwa!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” cried Stasch.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the negro slid down the stalk of a creeper. It could easily\r\nbe seen from his face that he was the bearer of some great news.\r\n\r\n“An elephant!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“An elephant?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the young negro, gesticulating with his hands; “over\r\nthere rushing water and here cliffs. Elephant can not get out. The Great\r\nMan kill elephant and Kali eat him—oh, eat! eat!”\r\n\r\nThis thought made him so happy that he began to jump around, to smack\r\nhis lips and slap his knees and to laugh like an idiot, at the same time\r\nrolling his eyes and showing his white teeth.\r\n\r\nStasch did not understand at first why Kali said that the elephant could\r\nnot escape from the gorge, so to make sure of what had happened he\r\nmounted his horse, and giving Nell into Mea’s care, so that he could\r\nhave both hands free in case it were necessary to shoot, he ordered Kali\r\nto mount behind him; then they all turned back and began to look for a\r\nplace where they could climb up. On the way, Stasch asked how the\r\nelephant could have got in there, and from Kali’s answer he surmised\r\nwhat had really happened.\r\n\r\nApparently the elephant had sought refuge from the flames during the\r\nforest fire, and on his way knocked against the rock, which, being\r\ninsecure, had fallen down and cut off all means of his return. On\r\nrunning further he had come to the end of the narrow pass and found\r\nhimself on the edge of the abyss, through which the stream flowed, and\r\nwas thus hemmed in.\r\n\r\nAfter a short time they discovered a way out of the gorge, but as it was\r\nrather steep, it was necessary to dismount and lead the horses. As the\r\nnegro assured them that the stream was not far off, they continued to\r\nwalk on until they reached the top. At last they came to a high strip of\r\nland, which was bordered on the one side by the stream and on the other\r\nby the ravine, and then looking down into the depth, they saw the\r\nelephant on the flat ground.\r\n\r\nThe huge animal lay on its stomach, and Stasch was very much astonished\r\nthat he did not jump up when he caught sight of them, for, as Saba made\r\na dash for the edge of the narrow pass and began to bark, the beast only\r\nmoved his enormous ears once, and raising his trunk, immediately let it\r\nfall again.\r\n\r\nThe children held each other’s hands tight, and looked at him a long\r\nwhile in silence, until Kali said:\r\n\r\n“He hunger, die.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, the elephant had become so thin that the whole length of his\r\nbackbone stood out like a comb; his sides were hollow, and beneath his\r\nhide, notwithstanding its thickness, his ribs could be plainly seen, and\r\nit was easy to conjecture that the reason he did not get up was because\r\nhis strength was exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe gorge, fairly broad at the entrance, changed into a small pocket,\r\nclosed in on both sides by perpendicular cliffs, at the bottom of which\r\ngrew a few trees. These trees had been broken off, their bark was torn\r\noff and not a leaf remained. Nearly all the vines that had overhung the\r\ncliffs had been eaten and the grass throughout the entire pocket had\r\nbeen uprooted and eaten, even to the very last blade.\r\n\r\nAfter Stasch had taken in the whole situation he began to narrate to\r\nNell what he had seen, but as he thought that the huge animal was doomed\r\nto die, he spoke very softly, as if afraid of darkening the last hours\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is really dying of hunger. Probably he has been a prisoner here\r\nfor the last two weeks, since the time when the forest fire burned up\r\nthe old jungle. He has eaten up everything that was eatable, and now he\r\nis being slowly tormented to death, for he can see bread-fruit trees and\r\nacacias growing above him, but is unable to reach them.”\r\n\r\nAnd once more they looked down in silence for a while at the elephant,\r\nwho every now and then turned his small, dying eyes toward them, and\r\neach time a sound like a sob escaped from his throat.\r\n\r\n“Really,” the boy said, “it would be a mercy to put an end to his\r\nsuffering.”\r\n\r\nAt these words he raised the rifle to his shoulder, but Nell caught him\r\nby the coat, and standing right in front of him, used all her force to\r\ndrag him away from the edge of the ravine.\r\n\r\n“Stasch, don’t do it! Give him something to eat! He is so thin! I will\r\nnot let you shoot him! I will not, I will not!”\r\n\r\nAnd stamping still more emphatically with her foot, she continued to\r\npull him away. He looked at her in surprise, but on seeing tears in her\r\neyes, said:\r\n\r\n“But, Nell——”\r\n\r\n“I will not allow it. I will not let him be killed! If you kill him, I\r\nshall get the fever!”\r\n\r\nThis threat sufficed to make Stasch abandon his murderous intentions in\r\nregard to this elephant and others as well. In fact, he remained silent\r\nfor a while, as he did not know what to answer the child; then he said:\r\n\r\n“Well, all right! All right! I tell you, it is all right! Nell! let me\r\ngo!”\r\n\r\nAnd Nell at once embraced him and a smile shone out of her tear-stained\r\nlittle eyes. Her only care now was to give the elephant some food as\r\nsoon as possible. Kali and Mea were very much surprised on hearing that\r\n“Bwana Kubwa” was not only not going to shoot the elephant, but that\r\nthey must straightway pick the fruit of the bread-tree, the pods of the\r\nacacia, and various herbs, leaves and grass, as much as they could\r\ncollect. Gebhr’s double-bladed Sudanese sword greatly aided Kali in\r\naccomplishing this task, for without it the work would have been by no\r\nmeans easy. But Nell did not want to wait until they had finished, and\r\nas soon as the first fruit fell from the breadfruit tree she grasped it\r\nwith both hands, carried it to the gorge, and repeated quickly to\r\nherself, as if afraid that any one else should get there first:\r\n\r\n“I! I! I!”\r\n\r\nBut Stasch had no thought of depriving her of this pleasure; on the\r\ncontrary, he took hold of her belt, for fear that in her great\r\nexcitement she might fall over the edge of the cliff together with her\r\nbread-fruit, and cried:\r\n\r\n“Throw it down!”\r\n\r\nThe enormous fruit rolled over the steep precipice and fell at the feet\r\nof the elephant, who immediately put out his trunk, picked it up and\r\ncrunched it as if eager to swallow it at once, and it disappeared\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\n“He has eaten it up!” cried Nell, overjoyed.\r\n\r\n“I should say so!” answered Stasch, laughingly.\r\n\r\nThe elephant now put out his trunk toward them, as if asking for more,\r\nand then could be heard his “Hrrumff!”\r\n\r\n“He wants more yet!”\r\n\r\n“I should think he did!” replied Stasch.\r\n\r\nA second fruit now disappeared like the first, followed by a third,\r\nfourth—tenth; then in rapid succession he ate acacia-pods, big bundles\r\nof grass, and various kinds of leaves. Nell, would not permit any one to\r\nreplace her, and when at last her little hands became tired, she still\r\npushed more food down to him with her feet. The elephant continued\r\neating, and it was only now and then, between mouthfuls, that he raised\r\nhis trunk and gave forth a thundering “Hrrumff,” to denote that he\r\nwanted more, and, as Nell felt certain, to show his gratitude.\r\n\r\nAt last Kali and Mea got tired of this work, which they had performed\r\nvery faithfully, and they silently hoped that “Bwana Kubwa” would fatten\r\nthe elephant and kill him later. At last “Bwana Kubwa” told them to\r\nstop, for the sun had now sunk quite low and it was time to begin the\r\nconstruction of the hedge. Luckily it was not very difficult, for two\r\nsides of the three-cornered strips of land were inaccessible, so that\r\nonly the third one needed to be fenced in, and plenty of acacias with\r\ntheir terrible thorns grew nearby.\r\n\r\nNell did not move an inch from the gorge, and crouching on its edge,\r\nwith her legs tightly crossed, she informed Stasch, who was some\r\ndistance away, what the elephant was doing—and her thin little voice\r\ncontinually rang out:\r\n\r\n“He is feeling around with his trunk!” or “He is moving his ears. He has\r\nenormous ears!”\r\n\r\nThen at last: “Stasch! Stasch! He is getting up! Oh!”\r\n\r\nStasch approached quickly and took Nell by the hand. In truth, the\r\nelephant had really gotten up, and only now could the children see his\r\nenormous size. They had occasionally seen large elephants being taken in\r\nships through the Suez Canal on their way from India to Europe, but not\r\none of them could compare with this colossus in size, for he really\r\nlooked like a large slate-colored, four-footed rock. He differed from\r\nthose they had seen in having enormous tusks five feet or more long,\r\nand, as Nell had already said, fabulously large ears. His front legs\r\nwere very long, but comparatively thin, which was probably due to his\r\nhaving fasted so many days.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a Liliputian!” cried Stasch; “if he were to take a good\r\nstretch and throw out his trunk to its full length he could catch hold\r\nof your little foot.”\r\n\r\nBut the giant neither thought of stretching himself nor of catching any\r\none by the foot. With uncertain steps he advanced toward the entrance to\r\nthe gorge and looked for a while down into the ravine, at the bottom of\r\nwhich the waters whirled; then he turned toward the side nearest the\r\nwaterfall, sat down on his stomach, put out his trunk into the water,\r\ndipped it down deep, and began to drink.\r\n\r\n“It was lucky for him,” said Stasch, “that he could reach down into the\r\nwater with his trunk. Otherwise he would have died.”\r\n\r\nThe elephant drank so long that the girl became alarmed.\r\n\r\n“Stasch, will he not harm himself?” said she.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” he answered smilingly; “but as you have taken him under\r\nyour special care you should warn him now.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Nell bent over the side and called:\r\n\r\n“Enough, dear elephant, enough!”\r\n\r\nAnd the “dear elephant,” as if he understood what was meant, immediately\r\nstopped drinking, and at once began to spray himself with the water,\r\nfirst his legs, then his back, and lastly his two sides.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile it began to get dark, and so Stasch guided the little\r\ngirl back to the hedge, where supper was already awaiting them.\r\n\r\nBoth children were in the best of humor—Nell, because she had saved the\r\nelephant’s life, and Stasch, because he saw her small eyes gleaming like\r\nstars and her happy little face looking fresher and healthier than it\r\nhad since their departure from Khartum. What also added to the\r\nsatisfaction of the boy was that he had promised himself a quiet and\r\ngood night’s rest. The strip of land, inaccessible on two sides, ensured\r\nthem from attack from those directions, and on the third side Kali and\r\nMea had erected such a high hedge out of prickly acacias and branches of\r\npassiflora[22] that there was no possibility of any beast of prey being\r\nable to break through the barrier. Besides the weather was fine, and\r\nsoon after sunset the sky was studded with stars. It was very pleasant\r\nto be cooled off by being in the proximity of the waterfall, and to\r\nbreathe the heavy fragrance of the jungle and the freshly broken off\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n“The ‘fly’ will not get the fever here!” thought Stasch joyfully.\r\n\r\nThey began to talk about the elephant, for Nell could speak of nothing\r\nelse, and she continually expressed her admiration for his huge size,\r\nhis trunk, and his tusks, which really were enormous. At last she said:\r\n\r\n“How wise he is, Stasch, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“As wise as Solomon,” replied Stasch. “But how did you find that out?”\r\n\r\n“Because, when I asked him to stop drinking, he immediately complied\r\nwith my request.”\r\n\r\n“If he had never taken lessons in the English language before, and\r\nunderstands what you said to him, then indeed it is quite remarkable.”\r\n\r\nNell perceived that Stasch was making fun of her, so she fondled him\r\nlike a little kitten, and said:\r\n\r\n“Say what you like, but I’m certain that he is very wise, and that he\r\ncan be readily tamed at once.”\r\n\r\n“Whether readily and at once I’m not sure, but he can be tamed. The\r\nAfrican elephant is wilder than the Asiatic, but I believe that\r\nHannibal, for instance, used African beasts.”\r\n\r\n“Who was Hannibal?”\r\n\r\nStasch looked indulgently and pityingly at her.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he said, “at your age you are not expected to\r\nknow—Hannibal was a great leader of the Carthaginian army, which used\r\nelephants in the war with the Romans, and as Carthage was in Africa, he\r\nwas obliged to use African elephants.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation was interrupted by a tremendous trumpeting of the\r\nelephant, which, after having satisfied his hunger and thirst,\r\nbegan—either from joy or longing to be free—to signal with his trunk.\r\nSaba sat up and began to bark, and Stasch said:\r\n\r\n“See what you have done? Now he is calling his friends. A nice story if\r\na whole herd were to approach.”\r\n\r\n“He will tell the others that we were good to him,” answered Nell\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\nBut Stasch, who really was not at all worried (because he reckoned that,\r\neven if several were to come along, the light of the fire would frighten\r\nthem away), laughed defiantly and said:\r\n\r\n“Well, well! But if elephants should appear, you will not cry for fear;\r\noh, no!—your eyes would only perspire as they have done twice before!”\r\n\r\nAnd he began to imitate her:\r\n\r\n“I’m not crying, only my eyes perspire so!”\r\n\r\nWhen Nell saw that he was joking she concluded that they were in no\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n“If we tame him,” she said, “then my eyes will not perspire any more,\r\neven if ten lions should roar.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because he will protect us.”\r\n\r\nStasch quieted Saba, who had continued to bark in answer to the\r\nelephant’s trumpeting, then thought a while and continued:\r\n\r\n“But, Nell, there is one thing that you did not think of. We shall not\r\nstay here forever; we must ride on further. I do not say immediately—on\r\nthe contrary. This place is very convenient and healthy, so I have\r\ndecided to remain here one week—perhaps two—for you and I and in fact\r\nall of us need a good rest. Well, all right! As long as we stay here we\r\nwill feed the elephant, although this is an enormous task for us all. He\r\nis imprisoned, and we can not take him with us. But how will this end?\r\nWe shall go away and he will stay here and starve once more, until he\r\nsuccumbs. And of course we will grieve even more than we would now.”\r\n\r\nNell felt very sad, and for a time sat there silently, apparently not\r\nknowing what answer to make to these very sensible remarks, but soon she\r\nraised her head, and pushing aside the lock of hair which always fell\r\nover her forehead into her eyes, she turned her eyes confidently toward\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n“I know,” she said, “that you could get him out of the gorge if you only\r\nwanted to.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nBut she put out a finger, touched Stasch’s hand, and repeated:\r\n\r\n“Yes! Yes! Yes!”\r\n\r\nThe small and clever little lady knew quite well that the boy would be\r\nflattered by her confidence in him and that from now on he would\r\nearnestly consider how to release the elephant.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\nAuselia Africana.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\nLissohibso.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\nJasminum trifoliatum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\nLandolphia florida.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\nThe spring rainy season.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\nOdenia globosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe night passed quietly, for although there was a bank of clouds toward\r\nthe south, the morning was clear.\r\n\r\nFollowing Stasch’s orders, Kali and Mea busied themselves after\r\nbreakfast gathering the fruit of the breadfruit tree, acacia pods, fresh\r\nleaves, grass and roots of all kinds of eatables for the elephant, and\r\nlaid them down on the edge of the gorge. As Nell wanted very much to\r\nfeed her new friend herself, Stasch cut from a young, wide-branched\r\nmelon-tree a kind of pitchfork, so that she could more easily throw the\r\nprovisions into the bottom of the ravine. The elephant had been\r\ntrumpeting since early morning, for he was evidently hungry, and when he\r\nsaw on the edge of the cliff the same little white creature who fed him\r\nthe day before, he greeted her by making a joyful sound and immediately\r\nstretched out his trunk toward her. In the morning sunshine the children\r\nthought he looked even taller than the day before. Although he was very\r\nthin, he seemed somewhat stronger now, and his tiny eyes looked almost\r\nmerrily at Nell. She even insisted that his forelegs had grown stouter\r\nover night, and she made such haste to throw the food down to him that\r\nStasch was obliged to restrain her, for she finally became greatly\r\noverheated and he had to take her place. Both children were having a\r\nvery good time, and they were especially amused at the queer faces the\r\nelephant made. At first the animal ate everything indiscriminately that\r\nfell at his feet, but when his hunger was somewhat appeased he was more\r\ndiscriminating. When plants were given to him that he did not like, he\r\npushed them away with his forefeet and tossed them in the air with his\r\ntrunk, as though trying to say: “These delicacies I reserve for you up\r\nthere to eat.” Finally, after the beast had satisfied his hunger and\r\nquenched his thirst, he began to slap his huge ears with great\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“I am sure,” said Nell, “that he would not hurt us now if we went down\r\nto him,” and in order to make sure she called down to the elephant:\r\n\r\n“Elephant, dear elephant, you would not hurt us, would you?”\r\n\r\nAnd as the elephant moved his trunk as if in answer, she turned\r\ntriumphantly to Stasch: “Look! He says ‘Yes!’ ”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” replied Stasch; “elephants are very intelligent animals,\r\nand this one has evidently come to the conclusion that we are necessary\r\nfor his welfare. Who can say whether he may not be a little grateful to\r\nus? It is better not to attempt it now, and certainly Saba would not\r\ndare do it, for he would be killed at once. Perhaps in time they may\r\nbecome friends.”\r\n\r\nAll further conversation about the beauty of the elephant was cut short\r\nby Kali, who, foreseeing that he would have to work hard every day to\r\nobtain food for the beast, approached Stasch, smiled cheerfully, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Great Man kill elephant and Kali eat him, instead of gathering grass\r\nand branches for him.”\r\n\r\nBut the “Great Man’s” thoughts were miles away from killing the\r\nelephant, and as he had a very happy disposition, he replied while\r\nstanding there:\r\n\r\n“You’re a donkey.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately he had forgotten the word for “donkey” in the Ki-swahili\r\nlanguage—so he used the English word “donkey” and Kali, who did not\r\nunderstand any English, concluded that this name was applied to him as a\r\ncompliment or a reward, for the children soon saw him turn toward Mea\r\nand heard him bragging as follows:\r\n\r\n“Mea has black skin and black head and Kali is a donkey.”\r\n\r\nThen he continued, with pride:\r\n\r\n“The Great Man himself said that Kali was a donkey.”\r\n\r\nStasch, after ordering them both to guard the young lady like the apple\r\nof their eye, and to call him at once should anything happen, grasped\r\nhis rifle and started off toward the fallen rock that blocked up the\r\ngorge. When he reached the spot he examined everything very carefully,\r\ninspected all the cracks, put a twig into a crevice which he discovered\r\nin the lower part of the rock and measured its depth exactly, then he\r\nslowly returned to the camping place, opened his cartridge-case and\r\nbegan to count the cartridges.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he counted three hundred when from out of a tall\r\nbaobab-tree near by, about five hundred feet from the tent, he heard\r\nMea’s voice crying:\r\n\r\n“Sir! Sir!”\r\n\r\nStasch approached the big tree, the hollowed-out trunk of which\r\nresembled a tomb, and asked:\r\n\r\n“What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“There are many zebras to be seen not far from here, and further off\r\nantelopes also.”\r\n\r\n“Good. I will take my gun and go after them, for we must have some meat\r\nto smoke. But why did you climb up in the tree and what are you doing up\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\nThe girl answered in a sad, drawling voice:\r\n\r\n“Mea saw a nest of gray parrots and wanted to bring the young ones to\r\nthe little lady, but the nest is empty, and so Mea will not get any\r\nglass beads for her neck.”\r\n\r\n“You will get some because you love the little lady.”\r\n\r\nThe young negress slid down hastily over the rugged tree bark, and with\r\neyes beaming with joy she called repeatedly:\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes! Mea loves the little lady very much, and she also loves\r\nglass beads!”\r\n\r\nStasch stroked her head kindly, then he took the rifle, closed the\r\ncartridge-case, and went in the direction where the zebras were grazing.\r\nAfter half an hour had elapsed the crack of a shot sounded in the\r\ncamping-place, and at the end of an hour the young hunter returned with\r\nthe good news that not only zebras, but numerous herds of antelope and\r\nsmall groups of water-bucks were feeding near the river.\r\n\r\nThen he ordered Kali to take a horse with him and get the animal which\r\nhad been killed, while he himself carefully examined the huge trunk of\r\nthe baobab-tree and began to test the rugged bark with the end of his\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?” asked Nell.\r\n\r\nHe answered:\r\n\r\n“Look, what a giant! Fifteen people holding one another’s hands could\r\nnot encircle this tree, which perhaps dates back to the time of Pharao.\r\nBut the lower part of the trunk is rotten and hollow. You see this\r\nopening is large enough for any one to pass through. One could make a\r\nsort of large room in there, where we all could live together. That\r\noccurred to me when I saw Mea up in the branches, and while I was\r\nsilently approaching the zebras the plan continually recurred to me.”\r\n\r\n“But we must hurry on to Abyssinia.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But we must rest also, and as I told you yesterday, I have decided\r\nto stay here a week or two. You would not want to leave your elephant,\r\nand on your account I am afraid of the rainy season, which has already\r\nbegun, when you will surely get the fever. The weather is fine to-day,\r\nbut you see that the clouds are gathering, and who knows if the rain\r\nwill not come before evening. The tent is not sufficient shelter for\r\nyou, and within this giant tree, provided it be not hollow to the very\r\ntop, we shall be able to laugh at the worst downpour. It would be much\r\nsafer for us within it than in the tent, for if we were to stuff this\r\nopening and the windows, which we would have to make for light, with\r\nthorns every evening, any number of lions could roar around the tree.\r\nThe rainy season only lasts a month during the spring, and I am still of\r\nthe opinion that we should wait until it is over. If we have to wait we\r\nhad better wait here in this giant tree than under a tent or anywhere\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\nAs Nell always acquiesced in Stasch’s plans, she assented now,\r\nespecially as she was delighted with the plan of remaining near the\r\nelephant and living in the tree. She began at once to think how she\r\ncould arrange the rooms, how furnish them, and how they would then\r\ninvite each other to “five o’clocks” and dinners. Finally they both\r\nbecame merry, and Nell immediately wanted to take a look at the new\r\nhouse, but Stasch, who had learned day by day from experience to be\r\ncautious, prevented her from proceeding in too great haste.\r\n\r\n“Before we take possession of the house,” said he, “we must beg the\r\npresent inhabitants, if there are any there, kindly to depart.”\r\n\r\nAfter this he ordered Mea to throw several lighted branches, which being\r\ngreen smoked profusely, into the interior of the tree. It was well he\r\ndid so, for the giant tree was indeed inhabited, and by tenants whose\r\nhospitality could not be depended upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe tree had two openings, a large one half a yard from the ground, and\r\na smaller one, somewhere about the height of the first story of a town\r\nhouse. Hardly had Mea thrown the burning branches into the lower one\r\nthan large bats began to fly out of the top one, and, blinded by the\r\nsun, they circled around the tree, screaming as loud as they could. But\r\nthe real master of the house soon wriggled out of the lower opening, and\r\nit proved to be an enormous boa-constrictor, which, though apparently\r\nstill half asleep, had devoured the remnants of its last feast, and not\r\nuntil the smoke reached its nostrils had it awakened and sought safety.\r\nAt the sight of this iron-colored body squirming out of the smoking\r\ntree-hollow, uncoiling itself like an enormous spring, Stasch picked\r\nNell up in his arms and started to run away with her in the direction of\r\nthe open wilderness. The reptile, itself frightened by the smoke and\r\nfire, did not follow them, but wended its way through the grass and the\r\npiles of baggage and disappeared very swiftly in the direction of the\r\ngorge, to hide itself in the crevices of the rocks. The children\r\nregained their courage. Stasch set Nell on the ground, hurried to fetch\r\nhis rifle, and then ran in the direction of the gorge after the snake.\r\nNell followed close behind. After going a short distance they beheld\r\nsuch an extraordinary sight that they both stood rooted to the ground.\r\nHigh above the gorge the body of the snake appeared for an instant,\r\nwriggled in the air, then fell to the ground. After a while it appeared\r\na second time, then fell down again. When the children reached the edge\r\nof the ravine they saw to their surprise that their new friend, the\r\nelephant, was playing with the snake, and after having thrown it in the\r\nair twice, he was now stamping on its head with his feet, which\r\nresembled blocks of wood. Having finished this performance, he lifted\r\nthe still squirming body with his trunk; this time he did not throw it\r\ninto the air, but right into the waterfall. Then he swayed from side to\r\nside, fanned himself with his ears, and began to fix his eyes on Nell,\r\nand at last put out his trunk toward her, as if demanding a reward for\r\nhis heroic and sensible deed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  “At the sight of the boa-constrictor squirming out of\r\nthe smoking tree-hollow, uncoiling itself like an enormous spring,\r\nStasch picked up Nell in his arms and started to run away.” ]\r\n\r\nNell immediately ran toward the tent and returned with a quantity of\r\nwild figs, a few of which she threw to him. He picked them up carefully\r\nand swallowed one after another. Those that fell into deep crevices he\r\npicked up by blowing into the cracks with such force that stones the\r\nsize of one’s fist flew into the air along with the figs. The children\r\nshowed their appreciation of these tricks by laughing and clapping their\r\nhands. Nell repeatedly brought more food, and every time she threw a fig\r\ndown she maintained that he was quite tame now, and that it would be\r\nsafe for her to go down to him.\r\n\r\n“Do you see, Stasch, now we shall have a protector—for he is afraid of\r\nnothing in the wilderness, not even of a lion or a snake, or a\r\ncrocodile. Besides, he is very good—and surely he ought to be fond of\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“If he should become tame,” said Stasch, “so that I might leave you in\r\nhis care, I would not be afraid to go off hunting, for I could not find\r\na better protector for you in the whole of Africa.”\r\n\r\nAfter a while he continued:\r\n\r\n“It is a fact that the elephants of Africa are wilder, but I have read\r\nthat the Asiatic ones, for instance, have a peculiar weakness for\r\nchildren. In India there has never been a case of an elephant hurting a\r\nchild, and when one of these animals becomes enraged, as sometimes\r\nhappens, children are sent to appease it.”\r\n\r\n“So you see, you see!”\r\n\r\n“At any rate, you were right in preventing me from killing him.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Nell’s eyes shone with joy. Standing on tip-toe, she laid both\r\nhands on Stasch’s shoulders, and leaning her head back and looking into\r\nhis eyes, she asked:\r\n\r\n“I behaved as if I were—how old? Tell me! As if I were—how old?”\r\n\r\nAnd he answered:\r\n\r\n“At least seventy.”\r\n\r\n“You do nothing but joke.”\r\n\r\n“Well, be angry! be angry! But who will release the elephant?”\r\n\r\nOn hearing this Nell clung to him like a young kitten.\r\n\r\n“You!—and I shall love you very much for it, and so will he.”\r\n\r\n“I have already thought about it,” said Stasch; “but it will be a very\r\ntroublesome thing to do. I shall not do it now, but only when we are\r\nready to continue our journey.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“For this reason: because if I should release him before he is quite\r\ntame and before he has got used to us, he would immediately run away.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! he will not leave me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think he is as fond of you as I am?” replied Stasch somewhat\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\nAll further conversation was interrupted by the approach of Kali, who\r\nbrought the slain zebra with its young one, which had been bitten to\r\ndeath by Saba. It was a lucky thing for the bulldog that he had followed\r\nKali, and had therefore not been present at the routing out of the\r\nsnake, for the dog would have followed it, and had he come within its\r\nreach would have been squeezed to death in its coils long before Stasch\r\ncould have come to the rescue. He received a box on the ears from Stasch\r\nfor having torn to pieces the young zebra, but he did not seem to take\r\nthis very much to heart, for he did not even put in his tongue, which\r\nhad been hanging out ever since he came from the chase.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Stasch gave Kali to understand that he intended to arrange a\r\ndwelling-place in the tree, and told him what had happened when smoking\r\nout the tree-trunk, and what the elephant had done to the snake. The\r\nthought of living in the giant tree, which not only served as a\r\nprotection against the rain, but also against wild animals, pleased the\r\nnegro very much, but, on the other hand, the elephant’s behavior did not\r\nat all meet with his approval.\r\n\r\n“The elephant is stupid,” said he, “and therefore he threw the ‘nioka’\r\n(snake) into the rushing waters, but Kali knows that ‘nioka’ is very\r\ngood to eat, and so he will fish it out of the water and roast it, for\r\nKali is clever—and a donkey.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are a donkey, all right,” answered Stasch. “You surely do not\r\nwant to eat a snake.”\r\n\r\n“Nioka is good,” said Kali.\r\n\r\nAnd pointing to the dead zebra, he added:\r\n\r\n“Better than this nyama.”\r\n\r\nThen they both walked toward the baobab-tree and began to arrange the\r\nhouse. Kali took a flat stone, the shape of a large sieve, from the bank\r\nof the river, laid it down inside the tree-trunk, and put more and more\r\nburning wood on it, taking care that the rotten wood in the inside of\r\nthe tree did not catch fire, which would have set the entire tree\r\nablaze. He said that he did this so that nothing could bite the “Great\r\nMan” and the little “Bibi.” It was soon apparent that this was no\r\nunnecessary precaution, for no sooner had the wreaths of smoke filled\r\nthe interior of the tree and rushed out than all kinds of vermin began\r\nto creep out of the broken bark—black and cherry-colored beetles,\r\nplum-sized hairy spiders, caterpillars covered with finger-long prickly\r\nhairs, and all sorts of horrible poisonous vermin, whose bite might even\r\ncause death. From what was taking place on the exterior of the trunk, it\r\ncould readily be imagined that many similar insects were meeting their\r\nfate in the clouds of smoke within, and the insects which fell to the\r\ngrass from the bark and the lower branches were unmercifully killed with\r\nstones by Kali, who all the time stared fixedly at the two openings in\r\nthe hollow trunk as if afraid that some strange creature would appear at\r\nany minute.\r\n\r\n“Why do you look like that?” asked Stasch; “do you believe that there is\r\nanother snake hidden in the tree?”\r\n\r\n“No; Kali is afraid of ‘Msimu.’ ”\r\n\r\n“What’s that, ‘Msimu’?”\r\n\r\n“Evil spirit.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever seen a Msimu?”\r\n\r\n“No, but Kali has heard the dreadful noise made by Msimu in the\r\nsorcerers’ huts.”\r\n\r\n“So your sorcerers are not afraid of him?”\r\n\r\n“The sorcerers fully believe in him; they enter our huts and tell us\r\nthat Msimu is angry, and the negroes bring them bananas, honey, pombe (a\r\nbeer made from a certain plant), eggs and meat, with which to propitiate\r\nMsimu.”\r\n\r\nStasch raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“I should think it would be delightful to be one of your sorcerers. But\r\ncould this snake have been Msimu?”\r\n\r\nKali shook his head.\r\n\r\n“If this had been so the elephant would not have killed Msimu, but Msimu\r\nwould have killed the elephant. Msimu is dead.”\r\n\r\nA weird crackling sound suddenly interrupted him. From the lower cavity\r\nin the tree came a strange-looking cloud of red dust; after which the\r\ncrackling became louder.\r\n\r\nKali at once prostrated himself on his face and began to scream in\r\nterror:\r\n\r\n“Aka! Msimu! Aka! Aka! Aka!”\r\n\r\nAt first Stasch drew back, too, but he soon regained his composure, and\r\nwhen Nell and Mea came running up he explained the probable cause to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“It is most likely,” he said, “that layers of mold, loosened by the\r\nheat, have fallen down and smothered the fire. But Kali believes it was\r\nMsimu. Mea shall pour water into the cavity, for if the fire is not\r\nsmothered and the mold should ignite, it might burst out and the whole\r\ntree be consumed.”\r\n\r\nStasch saw that Kali still lay prostrate in terror, repeating “Aka!\r\nAka!” so he picked up his rifle, shot into the cavity, then touched the\r\nboy with the butt of the gun and said:\r\n\r\n“Your Msimu is shot. Don’t be frightened.”\r\n\r\nKali raised himself a little, but remained on his knees.\r\n\r\n“O great, great sir! Is the master not even afraid of Msimu?”\r\n\r\nStasch’s reply was a laugh.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the negro became calm, and sat down to the meal prepared\r\nby Mea. It was very evident that his momentary fright had not affected\r\nhis appetite, for in addition to a substantial helping of smoked meat he\r\nate the raw liver of the young zebra, not to mention the wild figs,\r\nquantities of which grew on a neighboring sycamore. Then he and Stasch\r\nreturned to the tree, where there was still plenty of work to be done,\r\nfor it took more than two hours to take out the mold and ashes, the\r\nburned bats, the piles of roasted beetles, and other large insects.\r\n\r\nStasch wondered how the bats could have lived in such close proximity to\r\nthe snake, but he concluded that the monster either disdained such small\r\nprey or could not reach it, being unable to uncoil itself inside the\r\ntree. The heat had caused the layers of mold to break off, and thus\r\ncleaned out the interior very thoroughly. Stasch was delighted to see\r\nthis, for the cavity was as spacious as a large room, and would be big\r\nenough not only to shelter four persons, but ten. The lower opening\r\nformed a door; the upper, a window; and consequently it was neither dark\r\nnor stuffy in the giant tree. Stasch decided to divide the interior into\r\ntwo rooms by means of the tent canvas; one of these he intended for Nell\r\nand Mea and the other for himself, Kali, and Saba. The tree was not\r\ndecayed at the top, therefore no rain could penetrate it, and in order\r\nto make it completely waterproof it was only necessary to raise and prop\r\nthe bark slightly over both openings, so as to form two gutters. They\r\ndecided to strew the floor inside with sun-dried sand from the bank of\r\nthe stream, and to cover this with a padding of dry moss.\r\n\r\nThis was very hard work, especially for Kali, for he had also to smoke\r\nthe meat, water the horses, and supply food for them all, as well as for\r\nthe elephant, who continually reminded them of it by trumpeting. But the\r\nyoung negro set to work with great zest and industry arranging their new\r\nabode. The reason for his industry was discovered by Stasch that very\r\nday.\r\n\r\n“If the Great Man and Bibi,” said he, with his hands on his hips, “are\r\nto live in the tree, Kali will not have to build a large hedge for the\r\nnight, and so he will have nothing to do in the evening.”\r\n\r\n“So you like being idle, eh?” said Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Kali is a man, and so he likes to be idle, for only women should work.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you see that I work for Bibi.”\r\n\r\n“But, on the other hand, Bibi will have to work for the Great Man when\r\nshe grows up—and should she refuse, the Great Man will surely beat\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nAt the very thought of this Stasch sprang up and cried angrily:\r\n\r\n“You fool, do you know what ‘Bibi’ is?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” answered the frightened boy.\r\n\r\n“Bibi is—is—a good Msimu.”\r\n\r\nAt this Kali fairly staggered.\r\n\r\nOn finishing his work he walked shyly up to Nell, prostrated himself on\r\nhis face before her, and began in a beseeching, if not a frightened\r\nvoice, to repeat:\r\n\r\n“Aka! Aka! Aka!”\r\n\r\nAnd the “good Msimu” looked at him wonderingly with her lovely sea-green\r\neyes, for she could not understand what had happened, and what was the\r\nmatter with Kali.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe new dwelling-place, which Stasch had named “Cracow,” was all ready\r\nfor them in three days. Most of the baggage had been placed in “the\r\nmen’s room,” and even before the house was ready the four youngsters\r\nwere well sheltered there during a severe storm. The rainy season had\r\nnow set in in earnest. This rain is not like our long autumnal storms,\r\nwhen the sky is covered over with lowering clouds and the monotonous,\r\ndreary weather lasts for weeks. Here the dense clouds which water the\r\nearth so plentifully are dissipated by the wind several times a day.\r\nThen the sun shines again as though just emerging from a bath and floods\r\nthe cliffs, the stream, the trees, and the entire jungle with its golden\r\nlight. One can almost see the grass grow. The foliage on the trees is\r\nluxuriant, and before one fruit drops off another is forming. The\r\nexcessive moisture in the air makes it so transparent that even far-off\r\nobjects stand out distinctly and one can see to a great distance. On the\r\nhorizon there are beautiful rainbows, the colors of which are always\r\nreflected in the waterfall.\r\n\r\nDuring the short dawn and the twilight the sky shone and reflected a\r\nthousand bright colors more wonderful than the children had ever seen\r\neven in the Libyan desert. The clouds hanging down nearest the water\r\nwere cherry-colored, and the higher regions, better lighted, looked like\r\nseas of purple and gold, and the small, puffy clouds shone alternately\r\nlike rubies, amethysts, and opals. At night, in the intervals between\r\nshowers, the moon converted the dewdrops hanging on the leaves of the\r\nacacias and mimosas into diamonds, and the tropical light shone much\r\nmore brilliantly through the fresh, transparent air than at other\r\nseasons of the year.\r\n\r\nUnder the waterfall, in the swamps formed by the stream, the croaking of\r\nfrogs and the melancholy concert of toads rang out, and the fireflies,\r\nlike shooting stars, flitted through the bamboo bushes from one bank to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nWhen the clouds again hid the starry sky and it began to rain, the night\r\nbecame pitch dark, and inside the tree it was as dark as a cellar. To\r\nremedy this Stasch got Mea to melt some fat taken from the slain\r\nanimals, and out of a tin can be made a lamp, which he hung under the\r\nupper opening that the children called a window. The light from this\r\nwindow could be seen afar off through the darkness, and while it\r\nfrightened away the wild animals, it attracted bats and night birds, so\r\nthat finally Kali had to put up a kind of a curtain of thorns, like the\r\none with which he closed the lower opening for the night. In the\r\ndaytime, between showers, if the weather were fine, the children would\r\nleave “Cracow” and wander over the entire strip of land. Stasch would\r\nhunt gazels, antelopes, and ostriches, herds of which often appeared on\r\nthe banks of the lower stream, and Nell would visit her elephant, which\r\nat first only trumpeted when he wanted some food, but later began\r\ntrumpeting when he felt lonesome for his little friend. He always\r\ngreeted her with signs of joy, and at once began to prick up his large\r\nears whenever he heard her voice or step even far away.\r\n\r\nOne day when Stasch was out hunting and Kali was fishing above the\r\nwaterfall, Nell decided to go to the rock which blocked the gorge to see\r\nif Stasch had done anything to remove it. Mea, who was busy preparing\r\nthe mid-day meal, did not notice her departure. On her way Nell picked a\r\npeculiar kind of begonia,[23] which grew in large quantities between the\r\ncrevices of the rock; she approached the slope over which they had\r\nformerly ridden out of the gorge, and walked till she came to the rock.\r\nThe large boulder had broken off the side of the cliff, and barred the\r\nmouth of the ravine as before, but Nell noticed that there was still\r\nenough room between it and the wall of the cliff for even a grown person\r\nto get through easily. She hesitated a while and then passed through,\r\ngaining the opposite side. But there was still another bend, which had\r\nto be passed before reaching the broad mouth of the gorge, enclosed by\r\nthe waterfall. Nell began to consider what she should do. “I will go\r\nonly a little farther; then I will look from behind a rock and take a\r\npeep at the elephant; he will not spy me, and then I shall turn back.”\r\nSo she crept forward until she reached the place where the gorge\r\nsuddenly widened into a small, deep valley, and then she saw the\r\nelephant. He stood with his back toward her, his trunk in the water,\r\ntaking a drink. This encouraged her, and keeping close to the wall of\r\nthe cliff, she walked a few steps, bending forward a little more; just\r\nthen the giant beast, who was going to take a bath, turned his head, saw\r\nthe little girl and immediately started toward her.\r\n\r\nNell was thoroughly frightened, but having no time to retreat, she made\r\nher very prettiest courtesy, and then extending her hand in which she\r\nheld the begonias, said in a rather trembling voice:\r\n\r\n“Good morning, dear elephant! I know you will not hurt me, and so I have\r\ncome here to say good-day to you—I have only these little flowers——”\r\n\r\nThe colossus approached, put out his trunk and took from Nell’s fingers\r\nthe blossoms, but no sooner had he put them in his mouth than he let\r\nthem drop, for evidently he did not like the taste of the stringy leaves\r\nor the flowers. Nell now saw directly above her his trunk, which\r\nresembled an enormous black snake; it stretched and contracted, touched\r\nher little hands one at a time, then her arms, and at last it hung down\r\nand began to swing from side to side.\r\n\r\n“I knew you would not hurt me,” repeated the girl, although still\r\nsomewhat frightened.\r\n\r\nThe elephant flapped his huge ears, alternately extended and contracted\r\nhis trunk, and gave the grunt of satisfaction that he always did when\r\nthe girl approached the edge of the ravine.\r\n\r\nJust as Stasch had once faced the lion, so now these two (Nell and the\r\nelephant) stood face to face—he, a monster resembling a house or a\r\nrock, and she a tiny crab that he, even if not angry, but merely\r\ncareless, might trample under foot.\r\n\r\nBut the careful beast did not move an inch, and seemed delighted at\r\nbeholding his little visitor.\r\n\r\nNell gradually took courage; at last, raising her eyes and looking up as\r\nif to a high roof, she timidly extended her hand and asked:\r\n\r\n“May I stroke your trunk?”\r\n\r\nThe elephant did not understand English, but he immediately knew what\r\nshe meant from the motion of her hand, and pushed the end of his\r\ntwo-yard-long nose into the palm of her hand. Nell began to stroke the\r\ntrunk, at first only with one hand and very carefully, then with both,\r\nand at last she threw both arms around it and clung to it with childish\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nThe elephant moved from one foot to the other, and grunted with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nSoon after, winding his trunk around the fragile body of the girl, he\r\nlifted her high and began gently to swing her from side to side.\r\n\r\n“More! More!” cried Nell, delighted.\r\n\r\nThis game lasted quite a while; the girl, who now had entire confidence\r\nin the elephant and was no longer afraid, thought of another plan, for\r\non reaching the ground again she tried to climb up the foreleg of the\r\nelephant, as though climbing up a tree, or hid behind him, and asked him\r\nif he could find her. During these pranks she noticed that in the\r\nelephant’s feet, especially in its hind feet, there were a great many\r\nthorns, which the powerful animal was not able to extract, because, in\r\nthe first place, he could not reach his hind legs readily with his\r\ntrunk, and secondly, because he evidently was afraid of wounding the\r\nfinger which forms the end of the trunk, and without which he would lose\r\nall his dexterity. Nell did not know that thorns in the feet torment\r\nIndian elephants, and especially their cousins in the African jungles,\r\nwhich mostly consist of prickly plants. Her sympathies were aroused for\r\nthe kindly giant, and squatting down near one of his feet, she began to\r\npull out the large thorns and then the small ones, chattering\r\nincessantly and assuring the elephant that she would not let a single\r\none remain. He understood very well what was the matter, and bending his\r\nknee, he plainly showed that there were thorns in the soles of his feet\r\nbetween the hoofs protecting the toes, and these thorns were even more\r\npainful than the others.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Stasch had returned from hunting, and at once asked Mea where\r\nthe little lady was.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the answer that she was probably in the tree, he was just\r\ngoing to look inside when he thought he heard her voice in the gorge. To\r\nmake sure, he immediately sprang to the edge and looked down. He was so\r\nfrightened at what he saw that the blood nearly froze in his veins. The\r\ngirl was seated at the feet of the colossus, and the latter stood so\r\nquiet that but for the movements of his trunk and ears one might have\r\nthought him hewn out of stone.\r\n\r\n“Nell!” screamed Stasch.\r\n\r\nEarnestly engaged in what she was doing, she answered him cheerfully:\r\n\r\n“In a minute! In a minute!”\r\n\r\nThe boy, who was not accustomed to postpone action when in danger,\r\npicked up his rifle with one hand, while with the other he grasped a\r\ndried liana stem, twisted both legs around it, and in a second swung\r\nhimself down to the level of the narrow pass.\r\n\r\nThe elephant flapped his ears uneasily, but at this instant Nell arose,\r\nput her arms around his trunk and cried hastily, “Elephant, don’t be\r\nfrightened; that’s Stasch!”\r\n\r\nStasch at once saw that Nell was in no danger, but even then his legs\r\nshook under him and his heart beat violently. But before he recovered\r\nfrom his fright he mumbled in an angry but sad voice:\r\n\r\n“Nell, Nell, how could you do that?”\r\n\r\nShe began to excuse herself, saying she had done nothing wrong after\r\nall, for the elephant was kind and quite tame now, and she had only\r\nintended to take a closer look at him and then go back, but he had\r\ndetained her by playing with her and carefully swinging her, and that if\r\nStasch liked he would swing him, too. As she spoke these words she\r\nlifted the end of his trunk with one hand, and drawing it toward Stasch,\r\nshe waved the other hand from side to side, saying:\r\n\r\n“Elephant, rock Stasch, too!”\r\n\r\nThe intelligent animal guessed from her movements what she wanted, and\r\nin a second Stasch was grasped by the belt and swung through the air.\r\nSeeing him looking so angry and at the same time swinging through the\r\nair struck her as so comical, that she laughed till the tears ran down\r\nher cheeks, and clapping her hands, she repeated as before:\r\n\r\n“Elephant, swing Stasch, too!”\r\n\r\nIt was utterly impossible to maintain a severe demeanor and preach\r\nmorality while hanging to the end of an elephant’s trunk and being\r\ninvoluntarily swung to and fro with clock-like regularity, so the boy at\r\nlast laughed too. After a while, noticing that the trunk was moving more\r\nslowly, and that the elephant intended to put him down, a new idea\r\nseized him, and when near one of the elephant’s large ears he held on to\r\nit, and swinging himself onto the beast’s head, seated himself on his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n“Aha!” he cried, as he glanced down at Nell, “he shall know that he has\r\nto obey me.”\r\n\r\nAnd with the look of a lord and master he began to feel around the head\r\nof the beast.\r\n\r\n“Good!” cried Nell from below, “but how will you get down?”\r\n\r\n“That’s very easy,” answered Stasch.\r\n\r\nDropping his legs down over the elephant’s head, he fastened them around\r\nthe trunk and slid down as from a tree.\r\n\r\n“That’s the way I shall get down.”\r\n\r\nNow they both began to pull the remaining thorns out of the elephant’s\r\nfoot, and he submitted very patiently to the operation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the first drops of rain had begun to fall, so Stasch decided\r\nto take Nell back to “Cracow” at once. But an unexpected obstacle stood\r\nin their way, for the elephant would on no account part with her, but\r\nturned her round with his trunk and drew her toward him. The situation\r\nbegan to be serious, and on account of the obstinacy of the animal their\r\nhappy play was in danger of ending badly. The boy did not know what to\r\ndo, for it was now raining harder and a bad storm threatened. Both\r\nretreated a short distance toward the opening, but they had only taken a\r\nfew steps when the elephant followed them.\r\n\r\nAt last Stasch planted himself between Nell and the animal, looked\r\nseverely at him, and whispered to Nell:\r\n\r\n“Don’t run away, but retire slowly and with measured step toward the\r\nnarrow passage.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Stasch?” asked the little girl.\r\n\r\n“Return!” he repeated energetically; “for otherwise I shall have to\r\nshoot the elephant.”\r\n\r\nAt this threat she obeyed, especially as she now completely trusted the\r\nelephant, and she felt sure that on no account would he hurt Stasch.\r\n\r\nThe boy stood four feet away from the giant, his eyes riveted on him.\r\nSeveral minutes elapsed, then the situation became decidedly dangerous.\r\nThe elephant’s ears moved backwards and forwards several times, and he\r\nhad a peculiar twinkle in his little eyes; he raised his trunk suddenly.\r\n\r\nStasch turned pale.\r\n\r\n“Death!” he thought.\r\n\r\nBut the colossus as suddenly turned to the wall of the narrow pass,\r\nwhere he was accustomed to see Nell, and began to trumpet more sadly\r\nthan ever before.\r\n\r\nStasch now advanced toward the passage, and on the opposite side of the\r\nrock he found Nell, who would not return to the tree alone.\r\n\r\nThe boy felt inclined to say to her: “See what you have done! A little\r\nmore and I should have perished, and you would have been to blame.” But\r\nthis was not the time to reproach her, for the rain had become a storm,\r\nand it was necessary to get home as quickly as possible. Nell was quite\r\nwet, notwithstanding that Stasch had wrapped her in his own coat.\r\n\r\nWhen inside the tree Stasch ordered the negress to change Nell’s clothes\r\nimmediately. He released Saba, who had been tied up in the men’s room\r\nfor fear he would scent the game and frighten it away; then Stasch began\r\nto hunt through all the clothing and baggage once more, in hopes of\r\nfinding a small dose of quinine which might have been overlooked. But he\r\nfound nothing. There only remained a little white powder in a corner of\r\nthe bottom of the vessel which the missionary in Khartum had given him,\r\nbut so little that it was hardly enough to whiten the tip of one’s\r\nfinger. He therefore decided to pour boiling water into the receptacle\r\nand give this water to Nell to drink.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the storm subsided and the sun had come out again, he left\r\nthe tree to look at the fish caught by Kali. The negro had caught about\r\nten with a wire, which he had used for a line. Most of them were small,\r\nbut there were three a foot long, with silver spots, and of very light\r\nweight. Mea, who had grown up on the banks of the blue Nile, and knew\r\nabout the fish, said that these were very good to eat, and that at night\r\nthey jump high out of the water. While cleaning them it was found that\r\nthey were so light because they had large air bladders inside them.\r\nStasch took one of these little skins, which was the size of a large\r\napple, and showed it to Nell.\r\n\r\n“Look,” said he, “this was inside the fish. A pane for our window could\r\nbe made from a quantity of these bladders.” And he pointed to the upper\r\nopening in the tree.\r\n\r\nThen he thought for a minute and added:\r\n\r\n“And something else.”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Nell, very curious.\r\n\r\n“Kites.”\r\n\r\n“Like those you used to fly in Port Said? Oh, good! Make some like\r\nthem!”\r\n\r\n“I will; I will make the small frames out of thin strips of bamboo, and\r\nuse these bladders instead of paper. They will be lighter and better\r\nthan paper and the rain will not penetrate them. Such a kite will fly\r\nvery high, and in a strong wind it will fly—Heaven knows where.”\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly tapped his forehead.\r\n\r\n“I have an idea!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“You will see. As soon as my plan is formed you shall know all about it.\r\nAnd now the elephant is trumpeting so loud we can’t hear ourselves\r\ntalk.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, the elephant trumpeted so loudly and continuously because he\r\nwas lonesome for Nell, and perhaps for both children, that it shook the\r\nwhole gorge and the neighboring trees.\r\n\r\n“If we let him see us,” said Nell, “it may quiet him.” So they walked\r\ntoward the gorge. But Stasch, quite taken up with his new idea, began to\r\nmutter to himself:\r\n\r\n“Nell Rawlison and Stanislaus Tarkowski, from Port Said, who have\r\nescaped from the hands of the Dervishes, are to be found——”\r\n\r\nAnd taking breath, he asked himself:\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, but where shall I say—where?”\r\n\r\n“What, Stasch?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing! I have it now: ‘They can be found a month’s journey\r\naway to the east of the blue Nile—and beg for immediate assistance.’\r\nWhen there is a north or west wind I will send up twenty, fifty, one\r\nhundred of such kites, and you, Nell, will help me to stick them\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“Kites?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I tell you this much—they may be of more service to us than\r\neven ten elephants.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they had reached the edge of the precipice, and once more the\r\ncolossus began to move from one foot to the other, to shake himself, to\r\nprick up his ears, and as soon as Nell went away for a minute he began\r\ntrumpeting again. At last the girl explained to the “dear elephant” that\r\nthey could not always stay with him, for they had to sleep, eat, work,\r\nand attend to household duties in “Cracow.” He was only pacified when\r\nshe threw down to him the food Kali had prepared for him, but in the\r\nevening the trumpeting began again. That night the children named him\r\nthe “King,” for Nell insisted that before he entered the gorge he must\r\nhave been the king over all the elephants of Africa.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\nBegonia Johnstoni.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDuring the days that followed, when it did not rain, Nell spent most of\r\nher time with King, who now made no objection to her going away, because\r\nhe found that she returned frequently during the day. Kali, who was\r\nafraid of elephants, was very much surprised at this, but at last they\r\nconvinced him that the great and good “Msimu” had bewitched the giant,\r\nand he too began to visit it. King was kindly disposed to him and also\r\nto Mea; but Nell was the only one who could do what she liked with him,\r\nand a week later she ventured to take Saba along with her. Stasch felt\r\nvery much relieved, for without worry he now could leave Nell in the\r\ncare of—or, as he expressed himself, “under the trunk” of—the\r\nelephant, go hunting, and sometimes even take Kali along without feeling\r\nany anxiety. He felt certain that the animal would not now leave them\r\nunder any circumstances, and he began to ponder as to how he could\r\nrelease King from his imprisonment.\r\n\r\nHe had long ago fully decided on his plan of action; but the sacrifice\r\nit demanded was so great that he considered a long while before\r\nattempting it, and even then put it off from day to day. As he had no\r\none else with whom to talk the matter over, he finally decided to\r\nconfide his plans to Nell, although he still looked upon her as a child.\r\n\r\n“The rock could be blasted,” said he, “but that would mean the\r\ndestruction of a great many cartridges, for the bullets would have to be\r\nremoved, and the powder poured out until enough was obtained. This I\r\nwould put into the deep crevice in the middle of the rock, cover it up,\r\nand light it. The rock would then be blown to pieces, and we could let\r\nKing out.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose that were to make a dreadful noise—wouldn’t he be\r\nfrightened?”\r\n\r\n“Then let him be frightened!” replied Stasch quickly. “That is the least\r\nthing that worries me. Nell, it really is not worth while talking\r\nseriously to you.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless he continued talking, or rather thinking aloud:\r\n\r\n“If too little powder be used the rock will not split, and the powder\r\nwill be wasted, and yet if enough be put in there will not be much left\r\nover; besides, if it were to explode prematurely we might be killed.\r\nThen what would be left to hunt with, what to defend us with in case of\r\nan attack? You know quite well that if I had not had this rifle and\r\nthese cartridges we should long since have lost our lives, either when\r\nin Gebhr’s hands or from starvation. We are lucky, too, in having\r\nhorses, for by ourselves we could not carry either the baggage or the\r\ncartridges.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Nell put out her forefinger and said very emphatically:\r\n\r\n“If I tell King to do it, he will carry everything.”\r\n\r\n“What burdens will he have to carry; we have very few things left.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, he will protect us——”\r\n\r\n“But he can not shoot game with his trunk as I can with my rifle.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we can eat figs and the large pumpkin-like fruits that grow on\r\nthe trees, and Kali can catch fish.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, as long as we stay near a stream. We must stay here and wait until\r\nthe rainy season is over, for these continual showers are sure to give\r\nyou the fever. Remember that we must continue our journey later, and we\r\nmay possibly strike a desert.”\r\n\r\n“Like the Sahara?” asked Nell, much alarmed.\r\n\r\n“No; but one without streams and fruit-trees and acacias and mimosas. In\r\na place like that one can only live on game. King would find grass, and\r\nI antelopes, but if I have nothing to shoot them with King could not\r\ncapture them.”\r\n\r\nStasch certainly had reason to be worried, for now that the elephant was\r\ntame and had become so well acquainted with them, it would not be right\r\nto desert him and leave him to starve; on the other hand, releasing him\r\nmeant losing most of the ammunition and certainly risking death.\r\n\r\nAnd so Stasch put the work off from day to day, every evening repeating\r\nto himself: “Perhaps I may think of some other way to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other troubles came upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the first place Kali had been terribly tortured by bees when he went\r\nfar down the stream after a rather small gray-green bird, a so-called\r\nbee-hawk, well known in Africa. The black boy had been too lazy to smoke\r\nthe bees out, and although he returned with some honey, he was so stung\r\nand swollen that an hour later he became unconscious. The “good Msimu,”\r\nwith Mea’s assistance, drew out the poisonous stings, and then quickly\r\nmade him poultices of wet mud. But toward morning it seemed as though\r\nthe poor negro would die. Fortunately, good care and a strong\r\nconstitution triumphed, but it was ten days before he regained his usual\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, something had gone wrong with the horses. Stasch,\r\nwho was obliged to tie them up and lead them to water during Kali’s\r\nillness, discovered that they were beginning to get very lean. This\r\ncertainly was not caused by insufficient food, for the grass was very\r\nluxuriant after the rain, making very good pasture. And yet the horses\r\ndwindled before his eyes. A few days later their hair began to fall out,\r\ntheir eyes had lost their brilliancy, and a thick slime ran from their\r\nnostrils. Finally they refused to graze, and drank a great deal, as\r\nthough consumed by fever. When Kali saw them they were nothing but skin\r\nand bones, and he knew at once what was the matter.\r\n\r\n“Tsetse!” said he, turning to Stasch. “They must die!”\r\n\r\nStasch knew what this meant, for in Port Said he had often heard of an\r\nAfrican fly called “tsetse,” which is such a terrible plague in certain\r\nplaces that in districts permanently infected with it the negroes own no\r\ncattle, for where circumstances favor its multiplying it destroys\r\nanimals in no time. Horses, cattle, and donkeys which have been bitten\r\nby the tsetse-fly pine and die in a few days. Animals inhabiting these\r\ndistricts know the danger that threatens them, for entire herds of\r\ncattle, on hearing the buzzing near their watering-places, are so\r\nfrightened that they stampede in every direction.\r\n\r\nStasch’s horses had been stung by these flies, and not only the horses,\r\nbut the donkey, too. Kali rubbed them daily with a plant that smelled\r\nlike an onion, which he found in the jungle. He said that the smell of\r\nit would drive away the “tsetse”; but notwithstanding all his efforts\r\nthe horses continued to grow thinner. Stasch was terrified when he\r\nthought of what would happen if all the animals were to die. How could\r\nNell, the rugs, the tent, the cartridges, and the crockery be taken\r\nalong? There were so many things that at best King was the only one who\r\ncould carry them. But to release King would mean sacrificing two-thirds\r\nof the gunpowder.\r\n\r\nFurther and greater troubles were now heaped on Stasch’s head, like the\r\nclouds in the heavens, which rained down incessantly in the jungle. And\r\nat last came the greatest misfortune, the one before which everything\r\nelse seemed as nothing—the fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nOne day at table, just as Nell was putting a small piece of smoked meat\r\ninto her mouth, she drew back suddenly, as if disgusted, and said:\r\n\r\n“I can’t eat anything to-day.”\r\n\r\nStasch, who had found out from Kali where the bees were, and had smoked\r\nthem out daily and taken the honey, was certain that the child had eaten\r\ntoo much of the sweets, and therefore he paid no further attention to\r\nher loss of appetite. But presently she arose and began to run quickly\r\nround and round the campfire, each time making larger circles.\r\n\r\n“Don’t go too far away,” called the boy to her; “something might happen\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nBut he was not afraid of any harm coming to her, for the presence of the\r\nelephant, whom the wild animals scented, and his trumpeting, that\r\nreached their keen, attentive ears, kept them at a respectful distance.\r\nThis afforded protection to them as well as their horses, because even\r\nthe most ferocious beasts of prey in the jungle, such as lions,\r\npanthers, and leopards, do not care to come in contact with an elephant,\r\nor in too close proximity to his tusks and trunk.\r\n\r\nAs the girl continued running faster and faster around the fire, Stasch\r\nfollowed her and asked:\r\n\r\n“Nell, you little moth, why do you run around the fire like that?”\r\n\r\nThough he asked this in a cheerful voice, he had begun to be alarmed,\r\nand his uneasiness increased as Nell answered:\r\n\r\n“I don’t know; I can’t sit still in one place.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“I feel so uncomfortable and queer——”\r\n\r\nAll at once she leaned her head on his shoulder, as if confessing a\r\nfault, and cried out in a voice stifled by tears:\r\n\r\n“Stasch, I must be ill.”\r\n\r\n“Nell!”\r\n\r\nAt the same time he laid the palm of his hand on her forehead, which\r\nfelt dry and as cold as ice. Then he took her in his arms and carried\r\nher to the camp-fire.\r\n\r\n“Are you cold?” he asked on the way.\r\n\r\n“Cold and hot, but mostly cold.”\r\n\r\nHer teeth began to chatter, and her body was shaking with chills. Stasch\r\nwas now convinced that Nell had the fever.\r\n\r\nHe told Mea to take her at once into the tree, to undress her, and put\r\nher to bed. Then he covered her up with everything he could find, for he\r\nhad noticed that in Khartum and Fashoda fever patients covered\r\nthemselves up with sheep skins to induce perspiration. He decided to\r\nstay with Nell all night and give her hot water and mead to drink. At\r\nfirst she did not want to take it. By the light of their rudely made\r\nlamp Stasch noticed the glistening pupils of her eyes. Soon she began\r\ncomplaining of the heat and shivering at the same time, although covered\r\nwith felt rugs and a shawl. Her hands and forehead were always cold, but\r\nif Stasch had only had a slight knowledge of the symptoms of the fever\r\nhe would have seen from her great restlessness that she must have a very\r\nhigh temperature. He was terrified on noticing that when Mea appeared\r\nwith hot water the girl looked at her with astonishment, even with fear,\r\nand did not seem to recognize her at first. But with him she talked\r\nrationally, told him that she could not lie down any longer, and begged\r\nhim to let her get up and run about. Then she asked him whether he was\r\nangry with her for being ill, and on his assuring her that this was not\r\nthe case she blinked to drive back her tears, and promised that she\r\nwould be well the next day.\r\n\r\nDuring this evening, or rather this night, the elephant was particularly\r\nrestless and roared incessantly, which set Saba barking again. Stasch\r\nperceived that this excited the patient, and so he left the tree to\r\nquiet the animals. Saba was easily pacified, but it was more difficult\r\nto silence the elephant, and Stasch threw several melons down to him so\r\nas to close his trunk for a while. On his return he saw by the light of\r\nthe fire Kali walking in the direction of the stream and carrying a\r\npiece of smoked meat on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing, and where are you going?” he asked the negro.\r\n\r\nThe black boy stood still, and as Stasch approached he said with an air\r\nof secrecy:\r\n\r\n“Kali goes to the other tree to place meat there for the bad Msimu.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“So the bad Msimu will not kill good Msimu.”\r\n\r\nStasch wanted to reply, but a strange pain pressed like a weight on his\r\nchest, so he only bit his lips and went silently away.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the tree Nell had closed her eyes; her hands, which\r\nlay on the felt rug, were trembling very much, but still she appeared to\r\nbe dozing. Stasch sat down by her side, and as he was afraid of awaking\r\nher, he remained there motionless for some time. Mea, who was seated on\r\nthe other side, toyed all the time with the little pieces of ivory\r\nhanging in her ears in order to keep awake. It had become very quiet,\r\nand only from the lower bed of the stream, in the direction of the\r\nswamp, could the croaking of the frogs and the mournful tooting of the\r\ntoads be heard.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Nell raised herself up in bed.\r\n\r\n“Stasch!”\r\n\r\n“Here I am, Nell.”\r\n\r\nThen, shaking like a leaf blown by the wind, she eagerly began to search\r\nfor his hand and to repeat hastily:\r\n\r\n“I’m frightened; I’m frightened! Give me your hand!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be frightened. I’m here with you.”\r\n\r\nAnd he grasped her hand, which now burned like fire, and having no idea\r\nwhat to do, he began to cover the poor, wretched little hand with\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be frightened, Nell; don’t be frightened.”\r\n\r\nThen he gave her a drink of honey mixed with water, which had become\r\ncold. This time Nell drank greedily, and when he tried to take the cup\r\naway from her mouth she held his hands tight. The cold drink seemed to\r\nquiet her.\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued. Half an hour later Nell raised herself up again,\r\nand there was a terrible expression of fright in her wide-open eyes.\r\n\r\n“Stasch!”\r\n\r\n“What is it, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” she asked in a trembling, uncertain voice, “why do Gebhr and\r\nChamis walk around the tree and look in at me?”\r\n\r\nStasch suddenly felt as if thousands of ants had taken possession of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“What are you talking about?” he said. “There’s no one here. Kali is the\r\nonly one walking around the tree.”\r\n\r\nBut she stared through the dark opening and cried with chattering teeth:\r\n\r\n“And the Bedouins! Why did you kill them?”\r\n\r\nStasch put his arm around her and pressed her to him.\r\n\r\n“You know why! Don’t look over there! Don’t think of it! That happened\r\nlong ago.”\r\n\r\n“To-day! To-day!——”\r\n\r\nThis had happened a long time ago, but it always came back to her like\r\nthe wave that rolls back upon the shore, and it filled the mind of the\r\nsick child with horror. All attempts to quiet her were unavailing.\r\nNell’s eyes grew larger and larger. Her heart beat so hard that it\r\nseemed as if it would burst. Then she began to twist and throw herself\r\naround like a fish drawn out of the water, and that condition lasted\r\ntill nearly morning. Not until daybreak did her strength give out and\r\nher little head sink back on the pillow.\r\n\r\n“I’m weak, weak, weak!” she repeated. “Stasch, I seem to be falling down\r\nsome place.” And then she closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nAt first Stasch was overcome, for he thought she was dead. But this was\r\nonly the end of the first paroxysm of this terrible and treacherous\r\nAfrican fever, two attacks of which are as much as a strong, robust\r\nperson can stand—for nobody has ever survived a third attack. Travelers\r\nhad often described the fever when at Mr. Rawlison’s house in Port Said,\r\nand even more frequently the Catholic missionaries whom Mr. Tarkowski\r\nentertained on their way back to Europe had told about it. It seems that\r\na second attack comes on after a few days, and a third, which, if it\r\ndoes not appear within two weeks, is not fatal, for then it is\r\nconsidered to be the first attack of another case. Stasch knew that\r\nheavy doses of quinine alone could stop or alleviate the attacks, and he\r\nhad not a particle of it left.\r\n\r\nSeeing that Nell was still breathing, he became somewhat composed, and\r\nbegan to pray for her. In the meanwhile the sun appeared from behind the\r\ncliffs in the gorge, and it became bright daylight. The elephant was\r\nalready demanding his breakfast, and from the direction of the stream\r\nthe screams of the water-birds could be heard. As the boy wanted to\r\nshoot some birds to make a broth for Nell, he took the rifle and walked\r\nalong the edge of the stream to a group of high shrubs, in which the\r\nbirds generally perched for the night. But he was so exhausted from loss\r\nof sleep, and his mind was so preoccupied with the thought of the girl’s\r\nillness, that he did not see a swarm of birds, walking slowly in single\r\nfile, that passed him on their way to drink. Another reason why he did\r\nnot see them was that he was constantly praying. He thought of the\r\ndeaths of Gebhr and Chamis and the Bedouins, and lifting his eyes toward\r\nheaven, he said in a voice drowned with emotion: “Dear Lord, I did this\r\nfor Nell, for Nell; for otherwise it would have been impossible to have\r\nregained our freedom—but if I committed a sin, punish me, but restore\r\nher to health——”\r\n\r\nOn the way he met Kali, who had gone to see if the wicked Msimu had\r\neaten the meat he had offered him the day before. The young negro, who\r\nloved the little “Bibi,” prayed for her, too, but in quite a different\r\nway. For he told the wicked Msimu that if “Bibi” recovered he would\r\nbring him a piece of meat every day, but if she died he would—although\r\nhe felt frightened and knew he would perish—tear the wicked Msimu’s\r\nskin to shreds and cause him to remember him forever. But he took\r\ncourage when he saw that the piece of meat he had placed there the day\r\nbefore had disappeared. It might have been devoured by a jackal, but\r\nthen Msimu might have taken the form of a jackal.\r\n\r\nKali told Stasch of this favorable omen, but Stasch only gazed at him as\r\nif he did not understand, and went on his way. While vainly searching\r\nfor birds in the shrubbery, he approached the stream. Its banks were\r\nthickly wooded with tall trees, from which hung, like stockings, nests\r\nof the Remizen—pretty little yellow birds with black wings—and also\r\nwasps’ nests, shaped like large roses, and resembling gray\r\nblotting-paper. At one point the stream formed a fairly broad, swampy\r\nplain, which was partly overgrown with papyrus. In this swampy stretch\r\nof land were many flocks of water-birds. There were storks, like the\r\nEuropean ones, and others with large, thick, hooked beaks; velvety black\r\nbirds with blood-red feet, flamingoes, ibises, and white spoon-bills\r\nwith pink wings and spoon beaks, cranes with crowns on their heads, and\r\na number of gulls, variegated or gray as mice, which, like tiny forest\r\nsprites, ran to and fro on their long, thin, straw-like legs.\r\n\r\nStasch shot two large, bright-colored ducks, and walking over dead white\r\nbutterflies, which were strewn over the banks by the thousand, first\r\nmaking sure there were no crocodiles in the ford, he waded into the\r\nwater and picked up the game. The shot had evidently frightened away the\r\nbirds, for there remained only two marabous, that stood near the water\r\nat a short distance away. They resembled two old men, with bald heads\r\nbowed down on their shoulders. They did not move. The boy took another\r\nlook at their ugly food bags, hanging down on their breasts, then\r\nfinding that the wasps were surrounding him, he returned to the camp.\r\n\r\nNell was still asleep, so he gave the ducks to Mea and then stretched\r\nhimself out on a felt rug and at once fell into a heavy sleep. He did\r\nnot awaken until the afternoon, a little earlier than Nell. The girl\r\nfelt somewhat stronger, and being slightly refreshed, she drank some\r\ngood, strong broth, arose and left the tree to look at King and the sun.\r\nOnly now, by daylight, could be seen the ravages made by the fever in\r\none night. Nell’s skin was yellow and transparent, her lips were black,\r\nthere were large circles under her eyes, and her little face looked much\r\nolder. Notwithstanding that she assured Stasch she felt quite strong,\r\nand even though she had drunk a large cup of soup on awakening, she was\r\nhardly able to drag herself to the edge of the gorge. Stasch was\r\nterrified at the thought of the second attack. He had no medicine, nor\r\nanything else to help her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there were several heavy showers every day, and this greatly\r\nincreased the humidity in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThey passed anxious days awaiting the return of the fever, but the\r\nsecond attack did not appear for a week, and though it was not so\r\nviolent as the previous one, Nell felt much weaker after it. She had\r\nbecome so thin and had lost so much weight that she did not look like a\r\ngirl, but rather like the ghost of a girl. The little flame of her life\r\nflickered so feebly that it seemed as if a breath would blow it out.\r\nStasch realized that death would not have to wait for a third attack to\r\ncarry her off, and he expected her death from day to day, even from hour\r\nto hour.\r\n\r\nHe, too, had become quite thin and dark, for these misfortunes were more\r\nthan his bodily and mental strength could stand. Each day as he looked\r\ninto Nell’s face he often said to himself, “My reward for having\r\ncherished her as the apple of my eye will be the privilege of burying\r\nher in the jungle!” Why it should have come to this he could not\r\nimagine. At times he reproached himself for not having taken sufficient\r\ncare of her, and for not having treated her as kindly as he should, and\r\nthen he felt such a pain in his heart that he could have bitten his\r\nfingers for grief. This misfortune was overwhelming.\r\n\r\nNell now slept almost continually, which perhaps saved her life. But\r\nStasch awakened her several times during the day to give her some\r\nstrengthening food. Whenever it was not raining she would beg him to\r\ncarry her out into the open air, for she was unable to stand. It often\r\nhappened that she went to sleep even as he carried her in his arms. She\r\nknew that she was very ill, and that she might die at any time. At\r\nfirst, when she was a little better and felt inclined, she would talk\r\nabout it to Stasch, all the time crying, for she was afraid of death.\r\n\r\n“I shall never return to papa,” she once said. “But you must tell him\r\nthat the thought of it made me very sorry, and ask him to come here to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“You will return,” answered Stasch.\r\n\r\nBut he was unable to say any more, for he wanted to cry.\r\n\r\nAnd Nell continued in a scarcely audible and sleepy voice:\r\n\r\n“And papa will come here, and you will come back here again, too, won’t\r\nyou?” At this thought a smile lit up her tiny, wan face, and then she\r\nwhispered still more softly:\r\n\r\n“But I am so sorry——”\r\n\r\nAt the same time she leaned her little head on his shoulder and began to\r\ncry, but he, conquering his own emotion, pressed her to his heart, and\r\nanswered quickly:\r\n\r\n“Nell, without you I shall not return, and—and in fact I don’t even\r\nknow what I should do without you.”\r\n\r\nBoth became silent, and Nell fell asleep again. Stasch carried her back\r\nto the tree, but hardly had he stepped out of the dwelling than Kali\r\ncame running down from the highest point of the neck of land,\r\ngesticulating with his hands, and crying out in an excited and terrified\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“Great Man, Great Man!”\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\nAnd the negro extended his hand, pointing to the south, and cried,\r\n“Smoke!”\r\n\r\nShading his eyes with the hollow of his hand, Stasch gazed attentively\r\nin the direction indicated, the red light of the setting sun enabling\r\nhim to see a column of smoke ascending in the midst of the jungle\r\nbetween the peaks of two rather high hills.\r\n\r\nKali trembled from head to foot, for he still had a vivid recollection\r\nof their capture by the Dervishes, and he felt sure that the smoke came\r\nfrom their camp.\r\n\r\nAt last Stasch also thought that it must come from Smain’s camp, and so\r\nfor a moment he was as much frightened as Kali. This was the climax—to\r\nhave, in addition to Nell’s deadly illness, the Dervishes come upon\r\nthem, to be taken prisoners again, and carried back to Fashoda or\r\nKhartum in the hands of the Mahdi, or under Abdullah’s whip! If they\r\nshould be captured Nell would doubtless die the very first day, and he\r\nwould be a slave for life. For, even if he were to escape, what was\r\nlife, what was freedom without Nell? How could he look into the eyes of\r\nhis father or Mr. Rawlison if the Dervishes were to throw Nell’s body to\r\nthe hyenas and he could not tell where her grave was?\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts shot through his head like lightning. Suddenly he felt an\r\nuncontrollable desire to look at Nell, and he went toward the tree. On\r\nthe way he ordered Kali to put out the fire, and forbade him building it\r\nduring the night; then he entered the tree.\r\n\r\nNell was not asleep. She felt better, as she immediately told Stasch.\r\nSaba lay at her side and warmed her with his enormous body; she softly\r\nstroked his head and smiled when he tried to catch the little grains of\r\nmold that were flying about in the streak of light which the last rays\r\nof the setting sun threw into the hollow of the tree. She was evidently\r\nin a more cheerful mood than usual, for a little later she turned to\r\nStasch quite pleased and said:\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I may not die after all.”\r\n\r\n“You certainly will not die,” answered Stasch, “for as you feel stronger\r\nafter the second attack, you will never have a third.”\r\n\r\nAnd she began blinking as if trying to recollect something and then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“If I only had another little bitter powder, like the one that did me so\r\nmuch good the night after the lion visited us; you remember, don’t you?\r\nThen I should not even think of dying—not even so much——”\r\n\r\nAnd with one of her little fingers she indicated how little she would be\r\nprepared for death in such a case.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Stasch excitedly, “what would I not give for a grain of\r\nquinine! I don’t know what!”\r\n\r\nAnd he thought to himself that if he had enough quinine he would not\r\nhesitate to give Nell two little powders at once, then wrap her up in\r\nthe shawl, place her on his horse, and go off immediately in the\r\nopposite direction from the camp of the Dervishes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun had gone down suddenly and the jungle was in darkness.\r\nThe girl talked for nearly half an hour, and then went to sleep, and\r\nStasch continued to think about the Dervishes and the quinine. Although\r\ntortured by sorrow and fright, his extraordinarily clever brain began to\r\nbuild more and more daring plans. In the first place, he thought whether\r\nor not this smoke seen in the south was bound to come from Smain’s camp.\r\nIt certainly might come from the Dervishes’ camp, but also from an\r\nencampment of Arabians, who penetrate the interior of the continent in\r\nsearch of ivory and slaves. These Arabs were in no wise connected with\r\nthe Dervishes, who ruined their trade. It might also be a camp of\r\nAbyssinians, or some negro village in the mountains, into which the\r\nhunters after human beings had not yet penetrated. Would it not be more\r\nsensible to find out what it really was?\r\n\r\nThe Arabians of Zanzibar, from the districts of Bogamajo, Witu, and\r\nMombasa, and the seashore, continually came in contact with the whites,\r\nand who could tell if the offer of a large reward would not induce them\r\nto conduct Stasch and Nell to one of the nearest seaports. Stasch knew\r\nquite well that he could promise them such a reward, and that they would\r\nbelieve his word. But another thought caused him great uneasiness, for\r\nhe noticed that the Dervishes, especially those from Nubia, were almost\r\nas susceptible to fever in Khartum as the whites, and that they cured\r\nthemselves with quinine, stealing it from the Europeans, or if the\r\nrenegade Greeks or Copts had any secreted, they bought it at a great\r\nprice. And so it was probable that the Arabians from the borders of the\r\nocean would certainly have some of it.\r\n\r\n“I will go there,” said Stasch to himself; “for Nell’s sake, I will go\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\nOn thinking the matter over more carefully, he came to the conclusion\r\nthat even if they should prove to be Smain’s party, he would have to go\r\nthere. It occurred to him that, owing to the complete rupture between\r\nEgypt and Sudan, Smain might not have heard that they had been carried\r\naway from Fayoum. Fatima did not like Smain, and so the kidnapping must\r\nhave been a plan of her own, which had been executed with the aid of\r\nChamis (the son of Chadigi), and also of Idris, Gebhr, and the Bedouins.\r\nNow, Smain was not at all interested in any of these people, for the\r\nsimple reason that Chamis was the only one of them that he knew, and he\r\nhad never seen or heard of the others. He was only interested in his own\r\nchildren and Fatima. Perhaps he longed as much for them as they did for\r\nhim, and would be glad to be able to return to them, especially if he\r\nwere tired of being in the service of the Mahdi. He surely had not won a\r\ngreat prize while with them, for instead of being placed in command of a\r\nlarge army, or made ruler over a wide extent of territory, he was\r\nobliged to go, heaven knows how far back of Fashoda, to capture slaves!\r\n“I shall say to him,” thought Stasch, “ ‘If you will lead us to some\r\nharbor on the Indian Ocean and return with us to Egypt, the government\r\nwill forgive you everything, and you will be able to rejoin your\r\nchildren and Fatima, besides which Mr. Rawlison will make you a rich\r\nman—if not, you will never see your children or Fatima again.’ ”\r\n\r\nHe was certain that Smain would think well of it and that he would\r\nscarcely refuse such an offer.\r\n\r\nOf course this was only a surmise. In fact, while an investigation might\r\nprove their destruction, it might also prove their deliverance, and the\r\nonly means of help in this African wilderness. Stasch felt surprised at\r\nhimself for being terror-stricken at first at the thought of meeting\r\nSmain, but as it was necessary to procure assistance for Nell as soon as\r\npossible, he decided to go there that very night.\r\n\r\nThis was easier said than done. It is one thing to sit at evening before\r\na fire in the jungle, behind a hedge of thorns, and another to penetrate\r\nthe dense darkness and wade through the high grass, in which lions,\r\npanthers, and leopards, not to mention hyenas and jackals, prowl at this\r\ntime of night. But the boy remembered what the young negro said the time\r\nwhen he went off one night in search of Saba and brought him back, “Kali\r\nis afraid, but he goes!” and he repeated to himself, “I may be afraid,\r\nbut I will go.”\r\n\r\nAs the night was very dark, he waited until the moon rose, and when its\r\nlight shone out over the jungle he called Kali and said:\r\n\r\n“Kali, put Saba inside the tree, and block up the opening with thorns;\r\nyou and Mea must guard the little lady as the apple of your eye while I\r\ngo to see what kind of people are over there in that camp.”\r\n\r\n“Great Man take Kali with him and also the rifle which kills wild\r\nbeasts. Kali not stay behind!”\r\n\r\n“You will remain,” said Stasch with decision. “I forbid you to follow\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nHe now paused a while, and then continued in a rather hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n“Kali, you are faithful and smart, and I hope that you will do what I\r\ntell you. Should I not return, and should the little lady die, you must\r\nleave her in the tree, but round it you must erect a high hedge, and\r\ncarve a mark like this in the bark——”\r\n\r\nAnd picking up two bamboo sticks, he placed them together like a cross,\r\nand continued:\r\n\r\n“And should I not return, and should Bibi not die, then you must serve\r\nher faithfully and respectfully, and you must lead her to your people,\r\nand tell the Wa-hima warriors to take her due east until the great ocean\r\nis reached. There you will find white people, who will give you weapons,\r\ngunpowder, glass beads, wire, and as much canvas as you can possibly\r\ncarry. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\nBut the young negro knelt before him, clasped him round the knees, and\r\nsorrowfully pleaded with him, repeating:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bwana Kubwa! Return, return, return!”\r\n\r\nStasch was touched by the attachment of the black boy, and leaning down,\r\nhe placed his hand on his head and said:\r\n\r\n“Kali, go to the tree—and—God bless you!”\r\n\r\nAs he stood there alone, he thought about taking the donkey with him. It\r\nwould certainly be safe to do so, for the lions in Africa (just as the\r\ntigers in India), on meeting a man riding, always attack the animal and\r\nnot the man. But the question then presented itself that if the donkey\r\nwere killed, who would carry Nell’s tent, and on what would she ride?\r\nWhen he thought of these contingencies he completely gave up the idea of\r\ntaking the animal along, and began making his way through the jungle on\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe moon was already fairly high in the heavens, and it was now much\r\nlighter. But the boy’s troubles began at once, for he disappeared in the\r\ngrass, which had grown so high that horse and rider could easily have\r\nhidden in it. Even in the daytime it was not possible to see a foot\r\nahead, so one can imagine what it was by night, when the moonlight only\r\nshone over the surface, and lower down everything was bathed in utter\r\ndarkness. Under such conditions it was easy to lose one’s way and travel\r\nin a circle instead of advancing. But Stasch took courage when he\r\nthought, in the first place, that the camp to which he was traveling\r\ncould be at the most only three or four English miles away from the neck\r\nof land, and secondly, that the smoke had appeared between the peaks of\r\ntwo high hills; so by keeping the two hills in view he could not get\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nBut the grasses, mimosas, and acacias concealed everything. Fortunately,\r\ngroups of ant-hills sometimes more than ten feet high, appeared here and\r\nthere. Stasch carefully laid aside his gun when he came to each cluster\r\nof hills, and then he climbed to the top, and on seeing the hilltops\r\noutlined against the background of the dark sky, he climbed down again\r\nand continued his journey.\r\n\r\nWhen he thought of what would happen if the sky should become overcast\r\nand the moon no longer shine, he was very much frightened. But that was\r\nnot the only danger. In the dead silence of the night in the jungle\r\nevery noise, every step, and almost every sound made by the insects as\r\nthey creep through the grass can be heard. The sensation that comes over\r\none is gruesome; and Stasch was terrified. He had to take precautions\r\nagainst all sorts of catastrophes. He was obliged to listen attentively,\r\nto keep watch on all sides, and to hold his head ready to turn round\r\nlike a screw, and his rifle ready to shoot. Every minute it seemed as\r\nthough some animal was lying in ambush, or was creeping up near him.\r\nFrom time to time he heard the grasses trembling and the tramping of\r\nanimals running away. Then he thought that he must have frightened off\r\nthe antelopes, for although one of their number always keeps watch, they\r\nsleep very lightly, knowing full well that amateur huntsmen do not go\r\nout hunting in the dark at this time of night. But now he sees something\r\ndark, large, under an umbrella-acacia. It may be a rock, a rhinoceros,\r\nor a buffalo, which on scenting a human being will awaken and\r\nimmediately advance to attack him, and he also sees two glittering\r\nthings behind a black stone. “Ha!” Rifle to shoulder! “That’s a lion!\r\nNo!” False alarm! They are fireflies, for a tiny light rises in the air\r\nand glides over the grass, like a shooting star slanting downward.\r\nStasch not only climbed the ant-hills to make sure that he was going in\r\nthe right direction, but also to dry the cold perspiration which stood\r\nout on his forehead, to get his breath, and to wait until his heart\r\nshould cease to palpitate. Besides, he was already so tired that he\r\ncould hardly stand.\r\n\r\nBut he walked on, feeling that nothing must be left undone to save Nell.\r\nAfter two hours he came to a very stony place, where the grass was\r\nlower, and so it was much lighter.\r\n\r\nThe two peaks looked as far off as ever, but a little nearer there were\r\nsome rocks running irregularly in a transverse direction, above which\r\ntowered a taller rock, and they apparently encased a kind of valley or\r\ngorge, resembling the one in which King had been imprisoned. Now on the\r\nside of the cliff—about three or four hundred feet distant—he\r\nperceived the bright reflection of a flame.\r\n\r\nHe stood still. His heart was again beating so wildly that in the\r\nsilence of the night he could hear it thump. Whom is he likely to\r\nencounter down there? Arabians from the eastern coast? Smain’s\r\nDervishes? Or savage negroes, who have left their native villages, and\r\nfleeing from the Dervishes, have taken refuge in the most impenetrable\r\nforest of the mountains? Will he there find death, or imprisonment, or\r\nperhaps help for Nell?\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for him to turn back now, and besides, he had no\r\ninclination to do so; he crept slowly toward the fire, stepping as\r\nlightly as possible, and holding his breath. After he had gone about a\r\nhundred steps, he suddenly heard the neighing of horses in the jungle,\r\nand he stood still. By the light of the moon he counted five. The\r\nDervishes would have had more, so he supposed that the others were\r\nprobably hidden in the tall grass. But he was surprised that no one was\r\nwatching them, or that at least a fire had not been left burning in\r\norder to frighten off the wild beasts. He thanked God that things were\r\nas they were, for he could now advance without attracting attention.\r\n\r\nThe light of the fire on the cliff became still plainer. In less than a\r\nquarter of an hour Stasch reached a place where the cliff opposite him\r\nwas brilliantly lighted, which satisfied him that a fire must be burning\r\ndirectly below it.\r\n\r\nCrawling on all fours, he crept carefully up to the side and looked\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe first object that attracted his attention was a large white tent.\r\nBefore the tent stood a canvas camp-bed, and on it lay a person wearing\r\nwhite European clothes. A small negro, apparently about twelve years\r\nold, was throwing dry wood into the fire, which illuminated the side of\r\nthe cliff, and a row of negroes were sleeping on either side of the\r\ntent. The next moment Stasch slid down the slope into the bottom of the\r\ngorge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  “On a canvas camp-stead lay a person wearing white\r\nEuropean clothes. . . . A row of negroes were sleeping on either side of\r\nthe tent.” ]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFor the moment he was so weary and excited that he was unable to utter a\r\nword, and stood there gasping for breath in front of the man, who lay on\r\nthe bed, and who likewise remained silent, gazing at him with such utter\r\namazement that he was all but dazed.\r\n\r\nAt last the man cried out:\r\n\r\n“Nasibu! Are you there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered the young negro.\r\n\r\n“Do you see any one and is any one standing in front of me?”\r\n\r\nBut before the boy could answer Stasch regained his voice:\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he said, “my name is Stanislaus Tarkowski. I was captured by the\r\nDervishes, and have escaped with little Miss Rawlison, and we are hiding\r\nin the jungle. But Nell is very ill, and I pray you to help us.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger blinked at him, then passed his hand across his forehead\r\nand said to himself:\r\n\r\n“I not only see him, but hear him—it can not be imagination—What?\r\nHelp? I need help myself. I’m wounded!”\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he shook himself, as if awakening from a dream or a trance,\r\nlooked round, and regaining his presence of mind, said with a gleam of\r\njoy in his eyes:\r\n\r\n“A white boy! I look upon a white being once more! Welcome, whoever you\r\nare. You said some one was ill. What do you want of me?”\r\n\r\nStasch repeated that this sick person was Nell, the daughter of Mr.\r\nRawlison, one of the directors of the Suez Canal; that she had already\r\nhad two attacks of fever, and unless he were able to procure some\r\nquinine to prevent a third attack she must die.\r\n\r\n“Two attacks—that’s bad!” answered the stranger. “But I can give you as\r\nmuch quinine as you want. I have several jars full of it, which I shall\r\nnever need.”\r\n\r\nAt these words he told Nasibu to hand him a large tin box, which\r\nevidently contained a small medicine chest, and he took out of it two\r\nrather large jars filled with a white powder, and handed them to Stasch.\r\n\r\n“That is half of what I have left. It will last a year!”\r\n\r\nAt first Stasch felt inclined to cry aloud for joy, but he controlled\r\nhimself and began to thank his new friend as enthusiastically as though\r\nhis own life were at stake.\r\n\r\nThe stranger nodded his head several times and said:\r\n\r\n“Enough, enough. My name is Linde and I am a Swiss, from Zürich. Two\r\ndays ago I met with an accident. A wild beast wounded me very severely.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned toward the black boy.\r\n\r\n“Nasibu, fill my pipe.”\r\n\r\nInclining toward Stasch, he continued:\r\n\r\n“At night I always have more fever than in the daytime, and attacks of\r\ndizziness as well. But the pipe brightens me up and freshens my\r\nthoughts. You just said that you had escaped from the Dervishes, who\r\nheld you captive, and that you had hidden in the jungle. Am I right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; that is what I said.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you intend to do?”\r\n\r\n“To flee to Abyssinia.”\r\n\r\n“You will fall into the hands of the Mahdists, for whole troupes of them\r\nare hanging around the frontier.”\r\n\r\n“But what else can we do?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, only a month ago I could have been of assistance to you. But now I\r\nfind myself at the mercy of God and this black boy.”\r\n\r\nStasch looked at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n“And this camp?”\r\n\r\n“This is a camp of death.”\r\n\r\n“And these negroes?”\r\n\r\n“These negroes are asleep, and they will never awaken again.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand——”\r\n\r\n“They are stricken with the sleeping-sickness.[24] They are from the\r\nshores of the great lakes, where this terrible sickness is always very\r\nprevalent, and every one of them who has not died of the smallpox has\r\nbeen stricken down with it. I have only one boy left.”\r\n\r\nIt just occurred to Stasch that when he was sliding down the slope not\r\none of those negroes had moved, nor even budged, and that during the\r\nwhole conversation they were still sleeping, some with their heads\r\npropped up against the rocks and others with their heads hanging down on\r\ntheir chests.\r\n\r\n“They are asleep and will never awaken?” he inquired, as if he could\r\nscarcely believe his ears.\r\n\r\nLinde responded:\r\n\r\n“Oh, this Africa is a house of death.”\r\n\r\nBut the remaining words were interrupted by the tramping of the horses,\r\nwhich, frightened by something in the jungle, hopped along, their feet\r\nbeing hobbled, to the edge of the cliff, so as to be nearer the people\r\nand the firelight.\r\n\r\n“That’s nothing; it is only the horses,” said the Swiss quietly. “I\r\ncaptured them from the Mahdists, whom I conquered a few weeks ago. There\r\nwere at least thirty men of them. But they were armed for the most part\r\nwith spears, while my men had Remington rifles, which are now standing\r\nagainst the wall useless. If you need weapons or shot, help yourself.\r\nTake a horse, too. On horseback you can return more quickly to your\r\npatient. How old is she?”\r\n\r\n“Eight years,” answered Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Then she is still a child. Nasibu will give you tea, rice, coffee, and\r\nwine for her. Take your choice of our provisions and as much as you\r\nwant, and come again to-morrow to get some more.\r\n\r\n“I will certainly come back, to thank you from the bottom of my heart,\r\nand to do all I can to help you.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Linde said:\r\n\r\n“It is so pleasant to see a European face at least once more before I\r\ndie. If you come earlier than you did to-day I shall be more likely to\r\nbe myself. Now the fever is coming on again, for I see you double. Are\r\nthere two people standing by me? No! I know that you are alone and that\r\nthis is only the fever. Oh, Africa!”\r\n\r\nAnd he closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later Stasch left this strange camp of sleep and\r\ndeath and started on his return journey on horseback. It was still dark\r\nnight, but he was oblivious of the dangers which lurked in the tall\r\ngrass. He kept close to the stream, supposing that it led nearer the end\r\nof this narrow pass. The return journey was a great deal easier, because\r\nhe could hear the rushing of the waterfall in the distance. Besides, the\r\nclouds in the western sky had dispersed, and the constellations shone\r\nforth brightly near the moon. The boy put spurs, which were on the broad\r\nArabian stirrups, to the horse, and galloped over sticks and stones, as\r\nhe thought to himself: “What harm can lions and panthers do to me? I\r\nhave quinine for my little girl.” And from time to time he felt for the\r\njars of quinine to make sure he really had them and that it was not all\r\na dream. The most varied thoughts and scenes floated through his brain.\r\nHe saw the wounded Swiss, to whom he felt inexpressibly grateful, and\r\nwho had now aroused his sympathy, for during the first moment or so of\r\nhis intercourse with him he had taken him for an idiot; he saw the\r\nlittle Nasibu, with his round head shaped like a ball, the rows of\r\nsleeping men, the barrels of the Remington guns propped up against the\r\nrock, and lighted up by the fire. Besides, he was also all but certain\r\nthat the fight which Linde had told him about had been with Smain’s\r\ndivision—and he felt a peculiar sensation as he thought perhaps Smain\r\nalso had fallen.\r\n\r\nThese dreams mingled with his ever-present thoughts of Nell. He imagined\r\nhow surprised she would be the next morning on seeing a whole jar full\r\nof quinine, and how she would think him a prodigy. “Ah,” he said to\r\nhimself, “if I had lost courage and had not gone to find out where this\r\nsmoke came from, I would never have forgiven myself.”\r\n\r\nAfter a short hour had elapsed the sound of the waterfall became quite\r\ndistinct, and on hearing the croaking of the frogs, he knew that he must\r\nbe near the silicious ground on which he had killed the water-birds the\r\nprevious day. By the light of the moon he could even distinguish the\r\ndistant trees. Now he had to be especially on his guard, for this swampy\r\nland served as a watering-place, to which all the animals in the\r\nvicinity were obliged to resort, because in other places the banks of\r\nthe stream were exceedingly steep.\r\n\r\nIt was now far into the night, and apparently the beasts of prey had\r\ntaken refuge in the clefts of the rocks after their nocturnal hunt for\r\nprey. The horse neighed a little on scenting the fresh trail of lions or\r\npanthers, but Stasch passed safely on, and soon saw on the high\r\nprojection the large black silhouette of “Cracow.” For the first time\r\nsince he had been in the interior of Africa he felt as if he had reached\r\nhome. He had expected to find them all still asleep, but he never\r\nthought of Saba, who now began to bark loud enough to wake the dead.\r\n\r\nThe next moment Kali stood in front of the tree and cried:\r\n\r\n“Bwana Kubwa on horseback!”\r\n\r\nThe tone of his voice expressed more joy than astonishment, for his\r\nfaith in Stasch’s powers was so great that had the latter created a\r\nhorse out of nothing, the black boy would not have been very much\r\nsurprised. But as the negro always shows his happiness by laughing, he\r\nbegan to slap his sides and laugh inordinately.\r\n\r\n“Tie up this horse,” said Stasch; “take the provisions off his back,\r\nmake a fire, and boil some water.”\r\n\r\nThen he went inside the tree. Nell was also awake and had been calling\r\nfor him. On drawing aside the canvas, Stasch saw by the light of the\r\nlittle lamp her pale face and her little thin hands lying on the shawl,\r\nwhich served as a covering.\r\n\r\n“Little one, how are you?” he asked quite gayly.\r\n\r\n“Well! and I slept soundly until Saba woke me up. But why aren’t you\r\nasleep?”\r\n\r\n“Because I have been away.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“To the druggist’s.”\r\n\r\n“To the druggist’s?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. To get some quinine.”\r\n\r\nWe must confess that the child had not enjoyed the quinine powders which\r\nshe had previously taken, but as she considered them a panacea for all\r\nthe ills flesh is heir to, she sighed and said:\r\n\r\n“I know you have no more quinine.”\r\n\r\nStasch lifted one of the jars to the light and said with pride and joy:\r\n\r\n“What do you call this, then?”\r\n\r\nNell would not believe her eyes, so he continued hastily, brimming over\r\nwith pleasure:\r\n\r\n“Now you are going to get well again! I will lose no time in wrapping a\r\ngood dose up in the skin of a fresh fig, and you must swallow it, and\r\nwhat you will drink later remains to be seen. Why do you stare at me\r\nlike an idiot? Yes, I have a second jar, too. I received both of them\r\nfrom a white man, whose camp is about four miles from here. It is from\r\nhim that I have come. His name is Linde, and he is wounded, but he gave\r\nme many nice things to bring back. I returned on horseback, although I\r\nwent on foot. Do you think it is pleasant to go through the jungle by\r\nnight? Brr! I would not go a second time unless it were a matter of\r\ngetting quinine.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he left the astonished girl, went to the men’s\r\nquarters, and selecting the smallest fig from the provisions, hollowed\r\nit out and poured quinine into it, but he was very careful that the dose\r\nwas larger than the powders he had taken in Khartum. Then he left the\r\ntree, poured the tea into a pot of boiling water, and returned to Nell\r\nwith the medicine.\r\n\r\nAll this time Nell was very curious to find out what kind of person this\r\nwhite man was, how Stasch had found him, and if he were going to join\r\nthem, and whether they would all continue their journey together. Now\r\nthat Stasch had obtained the quinine, she had not the least doubt but\r\nthat she would recover. And so Stasch had gone through the jungle in the\r\nnight, and without telling a soul. Notwithstanding Nell’s admiration for\r\nhim, she had until now unconsciously taken everything he did for her as\r\na matter of course; for was it not natural that an older boy should\r\nprotect a younger girl? Now she began to think that had it not been for\r\nhis care and protection she would have given out long before; that he\r\nhad done a great deal for her, gratified all her wishes, and protected\r\nher as no other boy of his age could have done, or would do—and so her\r\nlittle heart was filled with gratitude.\r\n\r\nAnd when Stasch reappeared and bent over her with the medicine, she\r\nwound her little thin arms around his neck and hugged him tight.\r\n\r\n“Stasch, you are very good to me!”\r\n\r\nAnd he replied:\r\n\r\n“I! To whom else ought I be good? That’s a great idea! Take this\r\nmedicine.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he was greatly pleased, his eyes shone with satisfaction,\r\nand turning toward the opening in the tree, he cried out in a voice full\r\nof joy and pride:\r\n\r\n“Mea! Now bring Bibi the tea!”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\nIt has lately been discovered that this same tsetse-fly innoculates\r\npeople, as well as oxen and horses, with the fatal sleeping sickness,\r\nthough it has been found that their sting only causes the sleeping\r\nsickness in some places. At the time of the revolt of the Mahdi the\r\ncause of this illness was not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nIt was not until toward noon the following day that Stasch started out\r\nto revisit Linde, because he had to make up for the sleep he had lost\r\nthe night before.\r\n\r\nThinking that the sick man might need some fresh meat, he killed two\r\nbirds on the way, which were much appreciated. Linde was very weak, but\r\nperfectly rational. As soon as they had exchanged greetings he inquired\r\nhow Nell was; then he told Stasch that he did not think quinine alone\r\nwould cure the fever, and said that he must guard the little one against\r\nthe sun’s rays, dampness, spending the night in low, damp places, and\r\nfinally against bad water. Then, as requested, Stasch narrated his own\r\nand Nell’s adventures from the beginning as far as their arrival in\r\nKhartum and their visit to the Mahdi, and from Fashoda to their escape\r\nfrom Gebhr’s hands, and also their later wanderings. During this story\r\nthe Swiss looked at him with growing curiosity, and often even with\r\nevident admiration, and as the tale approached its end he lighted his\r\npipe, looked at Stasch once more from head to foot, and, apparently lost\r\nin thought, said:\r\n\r\n“If there are many boys like you in your country, it will be hard to\r\nconquer you.”\r\n\r\nAnd after a short silence he continued:\r\n\r\n“The best proof of the truth of your words is the fact that you are\r\nstanding here before me. And what I want to say to you is this, that you\r\nare in a terrible predicament; the route, no matter which direction you\r\ntake, is beset with dangers, but who knows whether such a brave boy as\r\nyou can not safely lead both himself and that child out of this great\r\nwilderness!”\r\n\r\n“If Nell would only get well again I will do everything in my power,”\r\ncried Stasch.\r\n\r\n“But you must take care of yourself, too, for the work that lies before\r\nyou would tax the strength of a full-grown man. Have you ever thought\r\nwhere you are?”\r\n\r\n“No; I only remember that after leaving Fashoda we passed a river—near\r\na large settlement called Deng.”\r\n\r\n“The river Sobat!” interrupted Linde.\r\n\r\n“At Deng there were many Dervishes and negroes. But on the other side of\r\nthe Sobat we entered into a region of jungle, and marched for weeks\r\nuntil we arrived at the gorge, in which you know what took place——”\r\n\r\n“I know. You then went on through the gorge till you came to that\r\nstream. Well, now listen; it is obvious that after passing over the\r\nSobat with the Sudanese you turned off to the southeast, or a little\r\nmore toward the south. The country you now happen to be in is unknown to\r\nexplorers and geographers. This river near us runs northwest, and\r\nprobably empties into the Nile. I say probably, for I am not quite sure\r\nmyself, although I turned off from the mountains of Karamajo to discover\r\nits source. After the fight the captured Dervishes told me that it was\r\ncalled Ogeloguer, but even they were not sure, for they only go into\r\nthis district to hunt slaves. This land was for the most part sparsely\r\ninhabited by the Schilluks; but now the country is devoid of human\r\nbeings, for some of the people have died of smallpox, others have been\r\nkilled by the Dervishes, and still others have fled into the mountains\r\nof Karamajo. It often happens in Africa that a stretch of land thickly\r\npopulated to-day becomes a wilderness to-morrow. I calculate that you\r\nare about 300 kilometers distant from Lado. In fact, you might take\r\nrefuge with Ermin in Sudan, but as it is quite likely that Ermin himself\r\nis besieged by the Dervishes, that course is out of the question.”\r\n\r\n“How about going to Abyssinia?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“It is also nearly 300 kilometers distant. Besides that, one must reckon\r\nthat the Mahdi is now at war with the whole world, consequently with\r\nAbyssinia. Besides, I have heard from the prisoners that bands of\r\nDervishes are wandering in the western and southern districts, and you\r\nmight easily fall into their hands. Abyssinia is certainly a Christian\r\nland, but the savage races to the south are either heathens or believers\r\nin Islam, and for that reason they secretly sympathize with the Mahdi.\r\nNo; you can not go through that country.”\r\n\r\n“Then what shall I do, and where shall I go with Nell?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“I told you that you are in a difficult position,” murmured Linde; then\r\nhe covered his head with his hands and remained silent a while.\r\n\r\n“From here to the ocean,” he at last said, “would be more than 900\r\nkilometers, through mountain regions, wild tribes, and even desert\r\nplaces, for on the way there are supposed to be large tracts of arid\r\nland. But nominally the country belongs to England. One might strike\r\ncaravans of ivory on their way to Kismaya-Lam and Mombasa, perhaps even\r\nmeet missionary expeditions. When I saw that, owing to the Dervishes, I\r\ncould not escape the course of this river, as it turns off toward the\r\nNile, I made up my mind to go east toward the ocean.”\r\n\r\n“Then we will return together!” cried Stasch.\r\n\r\n“I shall never return. The _Ndiri_ beast tore my sinews and veins so\r\nterribly that blood poisoning must certainly set in. Only a surgeon\r\ncould save me by amputating my leg. Now it has dried up and stiffened,\r\nbut on the first day the pain was so great that I bit into my hands\r\nand——”\r\n\r\n“You will certainly get well.”\r\n\r\n“No, my brave boy, I shall surely die, and you must cover me well with\r\nstones, so that the hyenas can not dig me up. This is perhaps of little\r\nconsequence to the dead, but while alive it is not a pleasant thought.\r\nIt is hard to have to die so far away from one’s family.”\r\n\r\nAt these words his eyes became veiled, and after a while he continued:\r\n\r\n“But I have become accustomed to the thought, so let us now talk about\r\nyou, not about me. I will give you one piece of advice: There is only\r\none road for you to take, which is to the east toward the ocean. But\r\nbefore attempting this journey you should rest well and gather strength;\r\notherwise your little companion will die in a few weeks. Postpone the\r\njourney until the rainy season is over and perhaps even longer. The\r\nfirst months of summer, when it has ceased raining, and the water still\r\ncovers the swamps, are the most healthful. This place, where we now are,\r\nis an elevated plateau lying nearly seven hundred feet above the level\r\nof the sea. In high regions of one thousand three hundred feet there is\r\nno fever, and if by chance it be carried there from places of lower\r\naltitude, it assumes a much milder form. Take the little English girl\r\nand go into the mountains with her.”\r\n\r\nTalking evidently tired him very much, and so he paused once more, and\r\nfor a time fought off large blue flies—the same kind that Stasch had\r\nseen in Fashoda.\r\n\r\nThen he resumed:\r\n\r\n“Pay strict attention to what I am going to tell you. One day’s journey\r\ntoward the south you will see an isolated mountain, not more than eight\r\nhundred feet high. It looks like an overturned saucepan; its sides are\r\nvery steep. The only way to reach it is by a mountain pass so narrow\r\nthat in some places two horses can barely walk abreast. On its flat\r\nsummit, about a kilometer broad, there used to be a small negro village,\r\nbut the Mahdists have killed some of the inhabitants and have taken\r\nothers away with them. It may be that this was done by the very Smain I\r\nconquered, but whose slaves I could not capture because he had already\r\nsent them under heavy guard toward the Nile. Up there on the top is a\r\nspring of excellent water, several fields of manioc and a quantity of\r\nbanana-trees. You will also find there many human bones, but you need\r\nnot fear that these corpses will produce a plague, for after the\r\nDervishes left the ants drove us away from the plain. Other than these,\r\nnot a human soul! Remain one or two months in that village. At that\r\nheight there is no fever. The nights are cool. There your little one\r\nwill regain her health and you your strength.”\r\n\r\n“And then what shall I do, and where shall I go?”\r\n\r\n“Leave the rest to the guidance of God. By all means try to go toward\r\nthe places in Abyssinia which are furthest away from the Dervishes, but\r\ngo toward the east. I have heard that the Arabians, hunting for ivory,\r\nwhich they get from the Samburu and Wa-hima tribes, advance as far as a\r\ncertain lake.”\r\n\r\nNow Stasch began to tell Linde how he had obtained Kali (Gebhr’s\r\nservant) after Gebhr’s death, and also that the young negro had said\r\nthat he was the son of the chief of the Wa-himas.\r\n\r\nBut Linde was much more indifferent to this news than Stasch had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n“All the better,” he said, “for he can be of use to you. Among the\r\nblacks there are kind souls, although on the whole one can not depend on\r\ntheir gratitude, because they are but children still, and forget to-day\r\nwhat happened yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Kali will not forget that I saved him from Gebhr—I’m sure of that.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly,” said Linde, and pointing to Nasibu, he added:\r\n\r\n“He is also a good child. Take care of him after my death.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t always think of death, and don’t talk of it.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” answered the Swiss, “I long for it—all I hope is that it\r\nwill take place without further suffering. Just think, I am now quite\r\nhelpless, and if one of the Mahdists whose band I dispersed should\r\naccidentally wander through this narrow pass, he could slaughter me like\r\na lamb single-handed.”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the sleeping negroes, and resumed:\r\n\r\n“These will never wake, or, more correctly, each one will wake once\r\nagain shortly before his death, and will run madly through the jungle,\r\nfrom which he will never return. Out of two hundred people there were\r\nonly sixty left me. Many ran away, died of smallpox, or lay down to die\r\nin other gorges.”\r\n\r\nStasch gazed at the negroes, his heart full of horror and pity. Their\r\nbodies were of an ashy gray, which in the negro signifies pallor. The\r\neyes of some were tightly closed, of others half open, but even these\r\nwere sleeping soundly, for the pupils of their eyes were not sensitive\r\nto the light. The knee-joints of some were swollen. All were so terribly\r\nemaciated that their ribs could be seen through their skin. Their hands\r\nand feet shook incessantly and rapidly. Blue flies had settled in thick\r\nmasses on their eyes and lips.\r\n\r\n“Is there no help for them?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“No. In the district of the Victoria-Nyanza this illness kills the\r\ninhabitants of entire villages. Sometimes it is worse than at others.\r\nThe inhabitants of the villages lying in the woods near its banks are\r\nmost frequently attacked.”\r\n\r\nThe sun was already in the west, but before evening Linde had told\r\nStasch of his adventures. He said he was the son of a merchant in\r\nZürich, that his family had come from Karlsruhe, and that in the year\r\n1848 they had settled in Switzerland. His father had made a great\r\nfortune as a silk merchant. He had his son trained as an engineer, but\r\nyoung Henry from his earliest youth was beset with the idea of\r\ntraveling. When he graduated from the Polytechnic School he inherited\r\nthe entire fortune of his father, and then started on his first journey\r\nto Egypt. This took place before the time of the Mahdi, and so he got as\r\nfar as Khartum, and hunted in the Sudan with the Dongalese. He then\r\ndevoted himself to studying the geography of Africa, in which he so\r\nexcelled that he belonged to many geographical societies. This last\r\njourney, which was to terminate so badly for him, had been undertaken\r\nfrom Zanzibar. He had got as far as the great lakes and intended to\r\nadvance along the unexplored mountains of Karamajo as far as Abyssinia,\r\nand from there to the borders of the sea. But the people of Zanzibar\r\nwould not accompany him any further. Fortunately, or unfortunately, war\r\nwas at that time raging between the kings of Uganda and Unyoro. Linde\r\nmaterially assisted the king of Uganda, and the latter as a reward gave\r\nhim more than two hundred black _Agisis_. That naturally greatly\r\nfacilitated the journey and the visit to the Karamajo Mountains, but\r\njust then the smallpox broke out among the people, followed by the\r\nterrible sleeping-sickness, and at last the caravan was demoralized and\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nLinde had with him quantities of provisions, consisting of all kinds of\r\ncanned goods, but as he dreaded the scurvy, he hunted daily for fresh\r\nmeat. He was a splendid shot, but not a very cautious hunter.\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened that a few days before, when he had foolishly\r\napproached too near a wounded _Ndiri_ wild boar, the animal sprang up,\r\ntore his leg terribly, and wounded him in the back. This happened quite\r\nnear this camp, and in full view of Nasibu, who tore up his own shirt\r\nand made a bandage of it to stop the flow of blood, and brought the\r\nwounded man back to the tent. But as the result of internal bleeding,\r\nclumps of coagulated blood formed, and the patient was threatened with\r\ngangrene.\r\n\r\nStasch insisted on bandaging him, and declared that either he would come\r\nto see him every day, or—so as not to leave Nell alone in the care of\r\nthe two negroes—put him on a felt rug stretched out between two horses\r\nand bring him to “Cracow.” Linde was willing to let Stasch make a new\r\nbandage for him, but he would on no account listen to the thought of\r\nbeing removed.\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said, pointing to his negroes, “that these people must die,\r\nbut as long as death has not yet come to them I can not condemn them\r\nwhile alive to be torn to pieces by the hyenas, who are only kept at a\r\ndistance during the night by the campfire.”\r\n\r\nAnd he at once began to repeat feverishly:\r\n\r\n“I can not, I can not, I can not!”\r\n\r\nHowever, he soon regained his composure, and continued in a peculiarly\r\nsad, ringing voice:\r\n\r\n“Come here to-morrow early. I have a great favor to ask of you, and if\r\nyou grant it, God will perhaps lead you both out of this African hell,\r\nand I will die contented. I wanted to postpone this request until\r\nto-morrow, but as I may be unconscious to-morrow, I will tell you\r\nto-day. Pour water into a vessel, go up to each of these poor sleeping\r\ncreatures, sprinkle water on his head, and say: ‘I baptize you in the\r\nname of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.’ ”\r\n\r\nThis he said with a voice full of emotion, and then became silent.\r\n\r\n“I blame myself,” he said after a while, “that I did not take leave in\r\nthe same way of those who died of the smallpox and of those who died\r\neven earlier. But now I am threatened with death—and would like\r\nto—that is, with the remainder of my caravan, go on this last great\r\njourney with them.”\r\n\r\nAt these words he pointed with his hand to the flaming sky, and two\r\nlarge tears trickled slowly down his cheeks.\r\n\r\nStasch wept like a child.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nOn the following day the sun shone down on a strange scene. Stasch\r\nwalked alongside of the steep cliff, stood still in front of each negro,\r\npoured water over each forehead while making the sign of the cross, and\r\nat the same time pronounced the sacred words. And they slept—their\r\nhands and feet shaking, their heads sunk on their chests or held\r\nupright. Though still alive, they resembled corpses. In this manner the\r\nsleepers were baptized in the quiet of the morning, in the light of the\r\nsun, in the silence of the wilderness. The sky was cloudless, highly\r\narched, gray-blue—as if shrouded in mourning.\r\n\r\nLinde was still rational, but became weaker and weaker. After his\r\nbandage had been changed he gave Stasch some papers locked up in a tin\r\nbox, and begged him to be especially careful of them; then he ceased to\r\nspeak. He could not eat, but he was dreadfully tortured by thirst, and\r\nbefore sunset he became delirious. He called to some children,\r\nforbidding them to swim out so far in the lake; at last he began to have\r\nconvulsions, and afterward sat holding his head in his hands.\r\n\r\nOn the following day he could not recognize Stasch, and three days\r\nlater, at noon, he died without regaining consciousness. Stasch truly\r\nmourned for him a while, then he and Kali carried the body to a nearby\r\ncave, the opening of which they closed with thorns and stones.\r\n\r\nStasch took little Nasibu with him to “Cracow,” and ordered Kali to stay\r\nthere, to look after the provisions and keep a large fire burning near\r\nthe sleepers at night. Stasch continually rode back and forth between\r\nthe two gorges, carrying back to “Cracow” baggage, weapons, and\r\nespecially the cartridges for the Remington rifles, out of which he took\r\nthe powder he needed to blast the rock that held King a prisoner.\r\nFortunately Nell’s health improved very much, owing to her daily dose of\r\nquinine, and the great variety of food had given her more appetite and\r\nincreased her strength. Stasch left her very reluctantly, and as he felt\r\nthat something might happen to her, he forbade her leaving the interior\r\nof the tree during his absence, and closed the opening with branches of\r\nthorny acacia. On account of the increasing duties which had fallen upon\r\nhim, he was often obliged to leave her in the care of Mea, Nasibu and\r\nSaba, on whom, by the way, he chiefly relied. He preferred to ride\r\nseveral times a day to Linde’s camp for provisions rather than leave the\r\ngirl too long. This of course meant a great deal of work, but his iron\r\nnature was proof against all fatigue. It took ten days before the things\r\nwere properly sorted; those not especially needed were done up in canvas\r\nand the necessary ones were deposited in “Cracow.” The horses were also\r\nbrought there, as were a large number of Remington rifles; these burdens\r\nwould now fall to the lot of King.\r\n\r\nWhile this was being done, some of the sleepers sprang up in their last\r\nparoxysm, fled wildly into the jungle, and never returned. But there\r\nwere others who died on the spot, and still others who rushed off\r\nblindly, dashing their heads to pieces on the rocks in or near the camp.\r\nKali had to bury them. Two weeks later only one remained, and he soon\r\nexpired in his sleep from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAt last the time had come to blast the rock and release King. He was now\r\nso tame that at Stasch’s command he lifted him with his trunk and set\r\nhim up on his neck. He had also become accustomed to carrying the\r\nburdens which Kali put upon his back by means of a bamboo ladder. Nell\r\nwas afraid that one of the pieces was too heavy for him, but the small\r\nload he had on his back seemed no heavier for him than a fly. It was\r\nonly now that their baggage—increased by the things Linde had left\r\nthem—would be burdensome for him. At first he showed great restlessness\r\non the approach of Saba, but now he was quite friendly with the dog, and\r\nplayed with him by throwing him down on the ground with his trunk,\r\nwhereupon Saba pretended to bite him. But sometimes he unexpectedly\r\npoured water over the dog, which, of course, the latter considered a\r\nvery poor joke.\r\n\r\nThe children were especially pleased that the intelligent beast\r\nunderstood everything that was required of him, and that he not only\r\npaid the greatest attention to every command or request, but to every\r\nsign given him. Elephants far outstrip all other animals in this\r\nrespect, and King greatly surpassed Saba, who only wagged his tail at\r\nevery command and threat from Nell, and then, in the end, did just what\r\nhe pleased.\r\n\r\nFor instance, after several weeks King observed that the person to be\r\nimplicitly obeyed was Stasch, and the person who engaged the attention\r\nof every one was Nell. And thus he obeyed Stasch’s commands the most\r\nreadily, and loved Nell the dearest. He did not care much for Kali and\r\nignored Mea.\r\n\r\nAfter Stasch had prepared the blast, he pushed it into the deepest\r\ncrack, closed the opening with clay, and only left a tiny hole, out of\r\nwhich hung a fuse of twisted palm threads rubbed with ground powder. At\r\nlast the decisive moment came. Stasch lighted the powdered thread\r\nhimself, then ran for his life toward the tree, in which he had\r\npreviously shut every one. Nell was afraid that King might become\r\ngreatly alarmed, but the boy calmed her by saying that, in the first\r\nplace, he had chosen a day when there had been a heavy thunderstorm in\r\nthe morning, and, secondly, that wild elephants must have heard the\r\npeals of thunder more than once when the elementary forces of the\r\nheavens had been let loose over the jungle. But nevertheless they sat\r\nthere with beating hearts, counting the seconds. At last a terrible\r\nnoise shook the air. The bamboo-tree trembled from top to bottom, and\r\nthe remains of the mold still left in the tree fell down on their heads.\r\nThe next moment Stasch sprang out, and avoiding the bends in the gorge,\r\nmade a straight line for the passage.\r\n\r\nThe results of the explosion were extraordinary. One-half of the chalk\r\nwall had broken into tiny bits, the other into larger and smaller blocks\r\nof stone, which the force of the blast had thrown and scattered quite a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe elephant was free.\r\n\r\nThe happy boy at once ran back up the hill, where he met Nell with Mea\r\nand Kali. King had certainly been frightened and had drawn back close to\r\nthe edge of the ravine, where he stood with upturned trunk, looking\r\ntoward the direction from which such an unusual clap of thunder had\r\nbroken out. But as soon as Nell began to call him he stopped moving his\r\nears from fright, and when she ran down to him through the newly opened\r\npassage he became perfectly calm. But the horses were more frightened\r\nthan King, and two of them had fled into the jungle, so that Kali could\r\nnot find them again until toward sunset. On the same day Nell led King\r\nback “into the world.” The colossus followed her obediently, like a\r\nsmall dog. Then he took a bath in the stream, after which he thought of\r\nsupper; so leaning his head against a large sycamore-tree, he bent it\r\nlike a weak reed, and devoted all his attention to chewing up the fruit\r\nand leaves.\r\n\r\nIn the evening he returned punctually to the tree, and sticking his\r\ngreat nose into the opening every minute, he searched so carefully and\r\npersistently for Nell that at last Stasch was obliged to give him a good\r\nsmack on his trunk.\r\n\r\nKali was the most pleased with the result of the day, for now he was\r\nrelieved from the task of collecting food for the giant, which had not\r\nbeen at all an easy matter. While preparing a fire to cook the supper\r\nStasch and Nell heard him singing a new hymn of joy:\r\n\r\n“The great man kill people and lions. Yah! Yah! Great man break up rock.\r\nYah! Elephant breaks his own trees, and Kali can idle and eat. Yah!\r\nYah!”\r\n\r\nThe “massika” or rainy season was nearly over. Of course there were\r\nstill dark and rainy days, but also some very fine days. Stasch now\r\ndecided to move over to the mountain, which Linde had told him about,\r\nand this plan was carried out soon after King’s release. Nell’s health\r\nno longer deterred him, for she was now decidedly better.\r\n\r\nSelecting a fine morning, they broke up camp and started for the south.\r\nNow they were no longer afraid of being lost, for the boy had found\r\namong the many other articles of Linde’s outfit a compass and an\r\nexcellent telescope, through which far distant places could be plainly\r\nseen. Besides Saba, King, and the donkey, five heavily laden horses were\r\ntaken along. King, in addition to the baggage on his back, carried Nell,\r\nwho sat on his neck between the enormous ears. She looked as though in a\r\nlarge armchair. Stasch left the peninsula-shaped promontory and the\r\nbaobab-tree without regret, for the remembrance of Nell’s illness clung\r\nto the place. But, on the other hand, the girl looked regretfully at the\r\nrocks, the tree, and the waterfall, and said that she would return again\r\nwhen she was “grown up.”\r\n\r\nBut still sadder was the little Nasibu, who had really loved his former\r\nmaster. Now, as he rode on the donkey at the end of the caravan, he\r\nturned back every minute to look at the place where the body of poor\r\nLinde was to rest till the Day of Judgment.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew from the north, and the day was very cool. Consequently\r\nthey did not need to rest from ten to three, the hours of the greatest\r\nheat, and therefore could go much further than caravans usually do in a\r\nday. The journey was not long, and a few hours after sunset Stasch\r\nperceived the mountain which was to be their destination. In the\r\ndistance another chain of hills stood out against the sky, but the\r\nformer was much nearer and stood out by itself like an island in the\r\nmiddle of a jungle sea. When they approached they saw that its\r\nprecipitous sides were washed by an arm of the same river on the borders\r\nof which they had previously lived. Its summit was shaped like a round\r\nbowl, and seen from below, seemed to be completely covered by a thick\r\nforest. Stasch figured that as the strip of land in which their\r\nbaobab-tree grew was 700 feet high, and this mountain 800 feet higher,\r\nthey would be living at an altitude of 1500 feet, and in a climate which\r\ncould not be much hotter than that of Egypt. The thought gave him\r\ncourage and made him desire to take possession of this natural fortress\r\nas quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThey soon found the mountain-pass, which was the only means of reaching\r\nthe summit, and immediately began to climb the mountain. An hour and a\r\nhalf later they had reached the top. The grove they thought they had\r\nseen from below proved to be not only a grove, but a banana-grove. The\r\nsight of this greatly pleased them all, including King; but Stasch was\r\nespecially delighted, for he knew that in all Africa there is no food\r\nmore strengthening, more healthful, and a better preventive against\r\nillness than flour made of dried bananas. And here was a year’s supply.\r\n\r\nHidden in the foliage of these plants were negro huts, some of which had\r\nbeen burned during the invasion, and some destroyed by other means;\r\nhowever, a few remained in fair condition. In the middle stood the\r\nlargest, which formerly belonged to the chief of the village. It had\r\nbeen tastefully constructed out of clay, with a broad roof forming a\r\nsort of veranda around the walls. Here and there in front of the huts\r\nlay single bones and also complete human skeletons, white as chalk, for\r\nthey had been thoroughly cleaned by the ants, of whose invasion Linde\r\nhad spoken. Many weeks had passed since the invasion of the little\r\ninsects, but in the hut there was still a strong scent of formic acid,\r\nand in the dwellings not a trace could be found of the large black\r\ncockroaches—which usually infest the mud huts of the negroes—or\r\nspiders, or scorpions, or any other vermin. Everything had been\r\ndestroyed by the terrible “siafu,” and so one could feel confident that\r\non the entire summit there was not a snake to be found, for even the\r\nboas fall victims to these unconquerable warriors.\r\n\r\nAfter Stasch had led Nell and Mea into the chieftain’s hut, he ordered\r\nKali and Nasibu to clear away the human bones. The black boy obeyed by\r\nsimply throwing them into the stream, and the force of the current\r\ncarried them along. But during this work they discovered that Linde had\r\nmade a mistake in telling them that they would not find a single living\r\nbeing on the mountain. The quiet which reigned after the kidnapping of\r\nthe inhabitants by the Dervishes, and the tempting look of the bananas,\r\nhad enticed a great many chimpanzees, which had arranged something\r\nresembling umbrellas, or small roofs, to protect them from the rain.\r\nStasch did not want to kill them, so he decided to frighten them away by\r\nshooting into the air. This caused a general confusion, which increased\r\nwhen Saba’s angry bark was heard, and King, excited by the noise, began\r\nto trumpet vociferously. But the monkeys did not have to seek far to\r\nfind a means of retreat, for they galloped to the edges of the cliff and\r\nlet themselves down so quickly and with such agility by means of the\r\ntrees growing alongside of the banks that King was unable to capture a\r\nsingle one with his trunk and tusks.\r\n\r\nThe sun had gone down, and Kali and Nasibu lighted a fire to cook the\r\nevening meal. After Stasch had unpacked the necessary things for the\r\nnight, he wended his way to the chief’s hut, of which Nell had already\r\ntaken possession. In the hut it was light and cosy, for Nell did not\r\nlight the small lamp that had served to illuminate the interior of the\r\nbaobab-tree, but a large traveling lamp which they had found among\r\nLinde’s things. As the day had been so cool, Nell did not feel\r\nparticularly tired after the journey. She was in a cheerful frame of\r\nmind, which increased when Stasch told her that the bones, which had\r\nfrightened her, had been cleared away.\r\n\r\n“How good it is to be here,” she said. “Look, even the ground is covered\r\nwith asphalt. Here we shall live luxuriously.”\r\n\r\n“I shall wait till to-morrow before taking a good look at the whole\r\nsettlement,” answered he; “but from what I have already seen to-day I\r\nconclude that it would be a good place to live in all one’s life.”\r\n\r\n“If our papas were here, yes, it would then be all right. But what shall\r\nwe name this settlement?”\r\n\r\n“In geographies this mountain is called Linde Mountain, and this village\r\nis named ‘Nell,’ after you.”\r\n\r\n“So, then, I shall also be represented in geography,” said she joyfully.\r\n\r\n“Certainly; it will perpetuate your name,” answered Stasch with great\r\nearnestness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nOn the following day it rained a little, but as there were also some\r\nhours between showers, Stasch began as soon as possible to explore his\r\nsurroundings, and by noon he had penetrated every corner. The inspection\r\nproved very satisfactory. In the first place, Linde Mountain was the\r\nmost secure place in the whole of Africa. Monkeys alone could scale its\r\nheights. Neither lions nor panthers could climb the plateau. As to\r\nguarding the mountain pass, they had only to install King at the\r\nentrance and then lie down and go to sleep peacefully. Stasch was\r\nconvinced that he could now resist attacks of small troups of Dervishes,\r\nfor the road leading to the mountain was very narrow, and one man alone,\r\nprovided he had a good gun, could block the entrance so effectually that\r\nnot a soul would be able to pass.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the “island” there bubbled forth a spring of cool,\r\ncrystal-clear water, the outlet of which was a small brook that wound\r\nits way through the banana-grove and at last plunged over the edge of an\r\noverhanging cliff into the river, thus forming a narrow waterfall, which\r\nglistened like a white ribbon. On the south side of the peninsula there\r\nwere fields covered with a luxuriant growth of manioc roots, which are\r\nmuch relished by the negroes. Behind these fields grew very high\r\ncocoanut palms, their crowns shaped like beautiful feather-dusters.\r\n\r\nA mass of jungle surrounded the “island,” and the view was very\r\nextensive. On the east could be seen the blue chain of the Karamajo\r\nMountains. On the south rose high hills, which, judging from their dark\r\ncolor, must have been covered with trees. On the west, however, the view\r\nextended to the horizon, where the jungle melted into the sky. But\r\nlooking through Linde’s telescope Stasch perceived various narrow\r\npasses, and here and there enormous trees, rising above the grasses like\r\nchurches. In some places, where the grass had not as yet grown very\r\nhigh, one could see with the naked eye herds of antelopes and zebras,\r\nelephants and buffaloes. Here and there giraffes made paths through the\r\ngray-blue jungle like ships furrowing through the sea. Close to the edge\r\nof the river some water-bucks were playing, while others raised their\r\nhorned heads above the deep water. In places where the surface of the\r\nwater was calmer, every now and then fish, the same kind Kali had\r\ncaught, would spring up, glitter like silver stars and then sink back\r\ninto the water. Stasch resolved that, as soon as the weather was better,\r\nhe would take Nell around and show her the menagerie. There were no\r\nlarge animals on the island, but immense numbers of butterflies and\r\nbirds. Large, snow-white parrots with black beaks and yellow breasts\r\nflew above the shrubbery, tiny whidah-birds, with beautiful plumage,\r\nglittering like jewels, swung from the thin stalks of manioc, and from\r\nthe high branches of the cocoanut-tree could be heard the sound of the\r\nAfrican cuckoo and the sad, soft cooing of the turtle-dove.\r\n\r\nStasch returned from his inspection feeling very happy.\r\n\r\n“The air here is good,” he said to himself; “this place is proof against\r\nattack, there is plenty of food to be had, and in fact it is a perfect\r\nParadise.”\r\n\r\nBut as he entered Nell’s hut he saw that a larger animal had put in an\r\nappearance on the island—indeed, there were two—for during his absence\r\nNasibu had found in the banana thicket a goat with her young one, which\r\nthe Dervishes had been obliged to leave behind. The goat was indeed\r\nsomewhat wild, but the young one immediately made friends with Nasibu,\r\nwho was very proud that he had found her, for he thought that now “Bibi”\r\nwould be able to have excellent milk every day.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n“Stasch, what shall we do now?” asked Nell one day, after they had\r\nsettled down and grown accustomed to the island.\r\n\r\n“There is plenty to do,” answered the boy, and he counted on his\r\noutstretched fingers all the tasks awaiting them.\r\n\r\n“To begin: Kali and Mea are heathens, and Nasibu, a child from Zanzibar,\r\nis a Mohammedan, and so everything must be explained to them; they must\r\nbe taught the true Faith and baptized. In the second place, meat for the\r\ncoming journey must be smoked, so I must shoot it; in the third place,\r\nas I have so many weapons and so much ammunition, I am going to teach\r\nKali how to shoot, so that two of us will be armed and ready to act on\r\nthe defensive; and, in the fourth place, have you forgotten about the\r\nflying kites?”\r\n\r\n“The flying kites?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that you are going to glue together, or, better still, sew\r\ntogether. That will be your work.”\r\n\r\n“I want to do something besides play.”\r\n\r\n“That will by no means be play, but a very important work, perhaps the\r\nmost important of all. Do not imagine that one kite will amount to\r\nanything; you must make fifty or more.”\r\n\r\n“Why so many?” asked the girl, grown curious.\r\n\r\nThen Stasch began to tell her his plans and hopes. He wanted to write on\r\neach kite their names, how they had escaped from the Dervishes, where\r\nthey were to be found, and where they expected to go. He was also going\r\nto write on them that they needed help, and to beg some one to send a\r\ntelegram to Port Said. He intended to send up these kites only when the\r\nwind was southwest.\r\n\r\n“Many of them,” he said, “will soon fall to the ground, but if only one\r\nof them reaches the coast and falls into the hands of Europeans we are\r\nsaved.”\r\n\r\nNell was quite delighted with this idea, and declared that even King was\r\nnot a match for Stasch when it came to cleverness. Yes, she was\r\nconvinced that a great many of the kites would even fly to their papas,\r\nand promised to glue such kites from morning till night. Her joy was so\r\nexcessive that Stasch was afraid it might bring on the fever again, and\r\nhe was therefore obliged to calm her enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe work which Stasch had mentioned was immediately begun in earnest.\r\nKali, who had been told to catch as many of the flying-fish as possible,\r\nstopped fishing, but on the other hand he erected a high fence of thin\r\nbamboo rods, or, to be more accurate, a kind of trellis, and this weir\r\nhe fastened across the river. In the middle of the trellis was a large\r\nopening, through which the fish would be obliged to swim in order to\r\nreach the open water. At this opening Kali placed a strong net made from\r\npalm-threads, and so caught a plentiful supply of fish every day.\r\n\r\nHe drove the fish into the murderous net with the help of King, who,\r\nbeing led into the water, darkened and disturbed it so that not only\r\nthose shimmering silver fish, but all other creatures living in the\r\nwater, tried to escape into the clearer depths. At this point the weir\r\nwas often damaged by crocodiles overturning the trellis in their efforts\r\nto escape, and King himself would often overturn it, for he cherished an\r\ninborn hatred against crocodiles. So he followed them, and as soon as\r\nthey reached shallow water he would pick them up with his trunk and\r\nthrow them on the bank, and he took the greatest satisfaction and\r\ndelight in stamping them to death.\r\n\r\nTurtles also were often caught in the net, and of them the little\r\nwanderers made a delicious soup. Kali prepared the fish by drying them\r\nin the sun, but the air-bladders he brought to Nell, who cut them in\r\ntwo, stretched them out on boards, and thus converted them into two\r\nsheets of paper the size of one’s hand.\r\n\r\nStasch and Mea helped Nell in this work, for it was by no means easy.\r\nThe skins were thicker than the bladders of our river fish, but after\r\nbeing dried they became quite brittle and were easily broken. Stasch at\r\nlast discovered that they should be dried in the shade. But sometimes\r\nhis patience was nearly exhausted, and that he did not give up the plan\r\nof making kites out of the bladders was due to the fact that he\r\nconsidered them lighter and better able to withstand the rain than\r\npaper. Though the dry season had now begun, he was not quite sure\r\nwhether, during the summer, especially in the mountains, there would not\r\nbe showers.\r\n\r\nBut he also glued together kites made out of paper, a quantity of which\r\nhad been found among Linde’s effects. The first light, large paper kite,\r\nwhich he let loose in a west wind, at once rose very high, and when\r\nStasch cut the string was carried by a strong current of air toward the\r\nchain of the Karamajo Mountains. Stasch followed its flight with the aid\r\nof a telescope until it got as small as a butterfly—yes, even until it\r\nlooked like a fly—and at last disappeared in the pale azure of the sky.\r\nOn the following day he loosed a second one, this time made of fish\r\nbladders, which ascended even more quickly into the air, but probably\r\nwas soon lost to view because of the transparency of the skins.\r\n\r\nIt was Nell who worked most perseveringly, and her little fingers soon\r\nbecame so skilful that she excelled Stasch and Mea. She was quite strong\r\nnow. The healthy climate of Linde Mountain had completely restored her.\r\nThe time for the third attack of the deadly fever to make its appearance\r\nhad passed. On that day Stasch hid himself in the banana thicket and\r\ncried for joy. After a stay of two weeks in the mountains he noticed\r\nthat the “Good Msimu” now looked quite differently than when in the\r\njungle. Her cheeks had become fuller, the former yellow and transparent\r\ncomplexion had disappeared, she looked rosy once more, and from beneath\r\nher luxuriant mass of hair her eyes looked out on everything shining\r\nwith happiness. From the bottom of his heart the boy was thankful for\r\nthe cool nights, the transparent spring water, the flour from the dried\r\nbananas, and above all, Linde.\r\n\r\nHe had become thin and sunburned, which was a proof that he would not\r\nhave the fever, for fever patients do not become tanned by the sun. He\r\nhad grown taller and more manly. His quick movements and the labors he\r\nhad performed had increased his ability and strength. The muscles of his\r\narms and hands, legs and feet were hard as steel. Now, in fact, he had\r\nactually become a seasoned African traveler. As he hunted daily and used\r\nbullets only, he had become a sure shot. He no longer feared wild\r\nanimals, for he knew that the wild and horned hunters were in more\r\ndanger from him than he was from them. At one shot he had killed a large\r\nrhinoceros which unexpectedly attacked him. He never paid the least\r\nattention to the numerous African buffaloes, which sometimes disperse\r\nwhole caravans.\r\n\r\nBesides the gluing of the kites and the other daily tasks, Stasch and\r\nNell also set to work to convert Kali, Mea, and Nasibu, and they found\r\nthis more difficult than they had expected. The black trefoil took great\r\npleasure in being taught, but looked at the lessons from the negro’s\r\npoint of view. When Stasch told them of the creation of the world, of\r\nParadise, and the serpent, everything went well, but when he got as far\r\nas the murder of Abel by Cain, Kali unconsciously patted his stomach and\r\nasked with great calmness:\r\n\r\n“And did he eat him up then?”\r\n\r\nThe black boy had always insisted that the Wa-himas never eat human\r\nbeings, but apparently the remembrance of the days when they did so\r\nstill remained with him as a national tradition.\r\n\r\nNeither could he understand why the Lord God had not killed the “wicked\r\nMsimu,” and many similar things. His ideas of good and evil were also\r\nquite African, which led to the following conversation between teacher\r\nand pupil:\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” asked Stasch, “what is an evil deed?”\r\n\r\n“If any one takes cows away from Kali,” he answered, after some\r\nconsideration, “that is an evil deed.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” cried Stasch; “and now give me a good one.”\r\n\r\nThis time he answered at once:\r\n\r\n“A good one—for instance—if Kali takes cows away from any one.”\r\n\r\nStasch was too young to know that similar ideas of good and evil are\r\nprevalent also in Europe, and are practised by politicians and even\r\napproved by entire nations.\r\n\r\nBut gradually light began to dawn in the black brains, and what brains\r\ncould not understand, warm hearts received. They were shortly ready for\r\nBaptism, which was performed with great ceremony. The god-parents\r\npresented each of the children with four doti (equal to about sixteen\r\nyards) of white percale and a string of blue glass beads. They felt\r\nsomewhat disappointed, however, for they were so childlike that they\r\nthought their skins would turn white immediately after Baptism, and they\r\nwere greatly surprised when they saw that they were just as black as\r\nbefore. But Nell calmed them by convincing them that they now had white\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nStasch also taught Kali how to use the Remington rifle, and this he\r\nlearned much more easily than the catechism. After ten days’ practice\r\nshooting at a target and at crocodiles sleeping in the sand on the river\r\nbanks, the young negro killed a large Pofir-antelope,[25] then several\r\ngazels, and finally a Ndiri wild boar. This hunt came near ending in an\r\naccident similar to that which had befallen Linde, for the boar,[26]\r\nwhich Kali had carelessly approached after firing the shot, sprang and\r\nflew at him with tail in the air. Kali dropped the gun, took refuge up a\r\ntree, and sat there until his screams attracted the attention of Stasch,\r\nwho found that the wild boar had been slain.\r\n\r\nStasch did not as yet permit the boy to hunt for buffaloes, lions, and\r\nrhinoceroses. Stasch would not shoot the elephants which came to the\r\nwatering-place by night, for he had promised Nell that he would never\r\nkill one of them.\r\n\r\nBut from the mountain-top he would look through the telescope morning\r\nand afternoon, and on seeing a herd of zebras, buffaloes, gazels, or\r\ndeer grazing in the jungle, he would follow them, taking Kali with him.\r\nDuring these excursions he often questioned Kali about the Wa-hima and\r\nSamburu tribes that they were bound to meet if they wanted to go east as\r\nfar as the seacoast.\r\n\r\n“Kali, do you know,” he once said, “that a journey of twenty days, or if\r\non horseback a journey of only ten days, would enable us to reach your\r\ncountry?”\r\n\r\n“Kali not know where Wa-himas live,” answered the young negro, shaking\r\nhis head sadly.\r\n\r\n“But I know,” said Stasch; “they live where the sun rises over a large\r\nstretch of water.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! yes!” cried the boy joyfully and greatly surprised. “Basso-Narok!\r\n(Dark Water.) That is our name for big black water. Great man knows\r\neverything!”\r\n\r\n“No; I don’t know how the Wa-himas would welcome us should we go there.”\r\n\r\n“Kali order them to fall on their faces before great man and good\r\nMsimu.”\r\n\r\n“And would they obey you?”\r\n\r\n“Kali’s father wear leopard skin and Kali, too.”\r\n\r\nStasch understood that this meant that Kali’s father was a king and that\r\nhe was the eldest son and the future ruler of the Wa-himas. And so he\r\ninquired further:\r\n\r\n“You told me once that white travelers had visited you and that the\r\nolder people remember them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and Kali has heard that they wore a great deal of percale on their\r\nheads.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” thought Stasch to himself, “so they were not Europeans, but Arabs,\r\nwhom the negroes, judging from the light color of their skins and their\r\nwhite clothes, mistook for white people.”\r\n\r\nBut as Kali remembered nothing about them and could give no further\r\ndescription of them, Stasch put another question to him.\r\n\r\n“Did not the Wa-himas kill any of these people dressed in white?”\r\n\r\n“No; neither the Wa-himas nor the Samburus can do that.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because they said that if the earth sucked up their blood the rain\r\nwould cease.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad they think that,” thought Stasch. Then he asked:\r\n\r\n“Would the Wa-himas go with us as far as the sea, if I were to promise\r\nthem quantities of percale, glass beads, and weapons?”\r\n\r\n“Kali go and also the Wa-himas, but great man must first conquer the\r\nSamburus, who are on the other side of the water.”\r\n\r\n“And who lives back of the Samburus?”\r\n\r\n“Back of the Samburus there are no mountains, only a jungle, and in it\r\nlive lions.”\r\n\r\nThis ended the conversation. Stasch now constantly thought of the great\r\njourney to the east, remembering what Linde had said about the\r\npossibility of meeting Arabs from the coast, who trade in ivory, and\r\nperhaps mission expeditions. He was sure that a journey like this would\r\nbe very fatiguing and dangerous for Nell, but he knew she could not stay\r\nall her life on Linde Mountain, and that they would soon have to move\r\non. The best time to leave is after the rainy season, when the\r\ninfectious swamps are covered with water and the ground is still damp.\r\nOn the summit of the mountain they had not as yet felt the heat; the\r\nnights were so cool that they had to cover themselves up to sleep. But\r\nbelow, in the jungle, it was now much warmer, and he well knew that it\r\nwould soon become unbearably hot there. It now rained less and less and\r\nthe water-line of the river became lower every day; so Stasch\r\nconjectured that the river valley would be converted into a dry bed in\r\nsummer, the like of which he had formerly seen in the desert of Libya,\r\nand that then there would only remain a narrow stream flowing in the\r\nmiddle of its bed.\r\n\r\nBut he deferred the departure from day to day. On Linde Mountain they\r\nall—men as well as animals—felt so much at home! Nell was not only\r\ncured of the fever, but also of her anemic condition. Stasch had no more\r\nheadaches and Kali’s and Mea’s skin began to shine like black satin.\r\nNasibu looked like a walking melon on thin legs, and King, as well as\r\nthe horses and the donkey, had become quite fat. Stasch knew very well\r\nthat they would not find another island like this in the midst of the\r\njungle during their entire journey. He looked into the future with much\r\nforeboding, although they now had considerable assistance, and, if need\r\nbe, an important defender in King.\r\n\r\nAnd so another week passed before they began making preparations for the\r\njourney. Whenever they were not busy packing they devoted the time to\r\nsending up kites containing the information that they were going in an\r\neasterly direction toward a certain lake. They sent them up continually,\r\nbecause a strong west wind was blowing almost a hurricane, which carried\r\nthem off over the mountains. To protect Nell from the heat Stasch made a\r\npalanquin out of the remains of the tent; this was to be placed on the\r\nelephant’s back, for the girl to ride in. After it had been put on King\r\na few times he became accustomed to the light weight, and also to having\r\nthe palanquin bound to his back with palm thongs. But this was a\r\nfeatherweight in comparison to the other baggage he was expected to\r\ncarry, which Kali and Mea were now busy sorting and packing.\r\n\r\nLittle Nasibu was told to look for bananas and to rub them to flour\r\nbetween two flat stones. King assisted him in picking the heavy clusters\r\nof fruit, but they both ate so much that the bananas in the vicinity of\r\nthe huts were soon gone, and they were obliged to go to another grove,\r\nsituated at the opposite end of the plateau. Saba, who had nothing to\r\ndo, often kept them company on these expeditions.\r\n\r\nBut Nasibu came near paying for his zeal with his life, or at least a\r\nvery strange kind of imprisonment. For it happened that once when he was\r\ngathering bananas on the edge of a steep, overhanging cliff he suddenly\r\nsaw in a crevice a horrible face, covered with black skin, with eyes\r\nthat blinked at him as it laughingly showed its front teeth. At first\r\nthe boy was nearly petrified with fear—then he began to run for his\r\nlife. But before he had gone far a hairy arm encircled him; he was\r\nlifted into the air, and the night-black monster started off running\r\nwith him toward a gorge.\r\n\r\nFortunately the enormous monkey could only run on two feet; consequently\r\nSaba, who happened to be near, easily overtook it and buried his\r\nenormous jaws in his back. A terrible fight ensued, in which the dog,\r\nnotwithstanding his great size and strength, would certainly have been\r\nworsted had not succor arrived in time to save him; for a gorilla can\r\neven conquer lions, and monkeys seldom let go their prey, even when it\r\nis a matter of regaining their freedom or their lives.[27] The gorilla,\r\nhaving been attacked from behind, could not easily get at Saba, but in\r\nspite of that he picked him up by the neck with his left hand and was\r\nlifting him in the air when the ground shook under a heavy tread, and\r\nKing came running up.\r\n\r\nA slight blow with his trunk was sufficient, and the terrible “forest\r\ndevil,” as the negroes call the gorilla, sank to the ground with brains\r\nand neck crushed. But to make sure that the monster was dead, or from\r\nhis natural antipathy to it, King nailed it to the ground with his tusks\r\nand then continued to wreak his vengeance on it until Stasch, who had\r\nbecome alarmed at the roaring and screaming, came running up from the\r\ndirection of the huts, gun in hand, and ordered him to stop.\r\n\r\nThe gorilla lay in a pool of blood, which Saba began to lick up, and\r\nKing’s tusks were stained with gore. It was a very large gorilla, and,\r\nthough dead, its upturned eyes and its teeth made it still a horrible\r\nlooking object. The elephant trumpeted triumphantly, and Nasibu,\r\nash-gray with terror, told Stasch what had happened. For a moment he\r\nconsidered whether he should fetch Nell and show her the horrible\r\nmonkey, but he dismissed the thought, for suddenly a great fear took\r\npossession of him. Nell often went out walking alone on the island, and\r\nmight not the very same thing happen to her?\r\n\r\nThis proved that Linde Mountain was not such a safe refuge as it at\r\nfirst seemed. Stasch returned to the hut and told Nell what had\r\nhappened; she listened in curiosity and fright, her eyes wide open,\r\ncontinually repeating:\r\n\r\n“You see what would have happened without King?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right! One need not worry about a child with a nurse like him;\r\nso while we are here don’t take a step away without him.”\r\n\r\n“And when are we going to leave?”\r\n\r\n“The provisions are ready, the baggage sorted, and there is nothing to\r\ndo but pack the loads on the animals; and so we can start to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“To see our papas?”\r\n\r\n“If it be God’s will!” answered Stasch gravely.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\nBosclapha Canna.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\nThe wild boars of Africa have a broad head, round, not three-cornered,\r\ntusks, and a fairly long tail which they elevate when attacked.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\nIt is true that gorillas live mostly in the forests of western Africa,\r\nbut Livingstone also met them in the east. They often carry off\r\nchildren. The gorilla of East Africa is less vicious than that of the\r\nwest, for it does not kill the wounded huntsman, but is satisfied with\r\nbiting off his fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nThey did not break up camp until several days later. They departed at\r\ndawn—six o’clock—after a short prayer, in which they earnestly\r\ncommended themselves to God. At their head rode Stasch on horseback,\r\npreceded by Saba. Behind him solemnly marched King, flapping his ears\r\nand carrying on his enormous back the palanquin in which Nell and Mea\r\nwere seated; then, under Kali’s guidance, followed the horses, tied\r\ntogether with a long rope, and laden with all sorts of baggage; and\r\nlittle Nasibu, on the donkey—which was as fat as the boy—brought up\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\nAt that early hour the heat did not inconvenience them very much,\r\nalthough the day was fine, and from behind the Karamajo Mountains the\r\nsun rose in great splendor from a cloudless sky. An eastern breeze\r\nmitigated the heat of its rays. Occasionally the wind blew a gale,\r\nwaving the jungle grass like billows of the sea. Vegetation had grown so\r\nluxuriantly after the copious showers—especially at the lower\r\nlevels—that King and the horses were covered up by the grass, so that\r\nall that could be seen above the waving jungle was the white palanquin,\r\nwhich looked like a ship sailing on a lake. After marching for an hour\r\nthey came to a dry, high plateau lying to the east of Linde Mountain,\r\nand saw enormous thistles,[28] with stems as thick as tree trunks and\r\nflowers as large as human heads. On the slope of many plateaus, which\r\nfrom a distance looked barren, they found heather eight feet high. Other\r\nplants, that grow very small in Europe, flourished here large as the\r\nthistles and heather, and giant trees, standing by themselves in the\r\njungle, looked like church towers. Especially that species of fig-tree\r\nknown as the “daroo-tree,” whose “weeping” branches turn into new stems\r\non touching the ground, covered enormous areas, so that each tree made a\r\nwilderness in itself.\r\n\r\nFrom afar off the country appeared like one unbroken forest; but when\r\nnearer it could be seen that the large trees grew only in certain\r\nplaces—at various distances apart. Toward the north very few of them\r\ncould be seen, and the country seemed more like a mountainous steppe\r\ncovered with an even jungle, out of which the umbrella-shaped acacias\r\nalone towered. The grasses there were greener, smaller, and apparently\r\nbetter suited for grazing. Nell from her high seat on King’s back and\r\nStasch from a hillock saw larger herds of antelope than they had ever\r\nseen before. The animals of each species grazed by themselves, or\r\noccasionally intermingled with the gnu, boar, gazel, Ariel, female\r\nantelope, buffalo, spring-buck, large koodoo, and others. There were a\r\ngreat many zebras and giraffes to be seen. On observing the caravan in\r\nthe grass the animals stood still, threw up their heads, pricked up\r\ntheir ears, and looked at the white palanquin in surprise; then they\r\nimmediately dispersed and ran away for a few hundred feet, then stared\r\nagain at the strange apparition, until they had satisfied their\r\ncuriosity, and calmly began to graze again. From time to time there\r\nappeared in front of the caravan a rhinoceros growling and snarling, but\r\nnotwithstanding its aggressive nature and its disposition to attack\r\neverything that comes in its way, it fled ignominiously before the\r\nglance of King, who was only kept from following it by a command from\r\nStasch.\r\n\r\nThe African elephant hates the rhinoceros, and if he comes across a\r\nfresh trail he follows it up till he finds his adversary, and, relying\r\non his superior strength, begins the fight in which the rhinoceros is\r\nnearly always worsted. It was not very easy for King, who certainly had\r\nmore than one death on his conscience, to renounce his old habit, but he\r\nwas now tame and accustomed to look upon Stasch as his master;\r\ntherefore, on hearing his voice, and seeing his bright and threatening\r\neyes, the beast dropped his upturned trunk, drew in his ears, and calmly\r\nwalked on. Though Stasch would have enjoyed seeing a fight between these\r\ngiants, he was afraid of its effect on Nell. If the elephant were to\r\ngallop, the palanquin might fall to pieces, or, what would be worse, the\r\nenormous animal might knock it against a tree; so Nell’s life would be\r\nin great danger. From the tales of the chase which Stasch had read when\r\nat Port Said he learned that in India people hunting tigers are more\r\nafraid that the elephant, in the excitement of the chase, might knock\r\nthe small tower against a tree than they are even of the tigers.\r\nBesides, the giant gallops so clumsily that to ride like that any length\r\nof time would endanger one’s health.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the presence of King obviated many dangers. The\r\nvicious buffaloes they met that day on their way to the small lake,\r\nwhere all the animals in the neighborhood congregated at nightfall, also\r\nfled when he looked at them, and ran to the other side of the lake to\r\ndrink. With his left foot tied to a tree, King guarded the tent in which\r\nNell slept, and this so thoroughly protected her that although Stasch\r\nkept a fire burning, he thought it unnecessary to build a hedge around\r\nthe camp, although he knew that there must certainly be lions in the\r\nvicinity of so many herds of antelope; in fact, some of them began to\r\nroar that very night among the enormous juniper-trees[29] on the\r\nmountain slope. Attracted by the scent of the horses, they approached\r\nthe camp, notwithstanding the burning fire, but when King could no\r\nlonger stand their constant roaring, and began to send forth his\r\nthreatening, thunder-like trumpeting, they quieted down humbly, for they\r\nseemed to know that they had better not come in contact with such an\r\nantagonist. After this the children slept soundly for the remainder of\r\nthe night, and they did not continue their journey until daybreak.\r\n\r\nBut now Stasch was to have new troubles and worries. He noticed that\r\nthey were traveling very slowly and that they could not cover more than\r\nten kilometers a day. If they progressed no faster than that they would\r\ncertainly not reach the borders of Abyssinia in a month, but as Stasch\r\nhad decided to follow Linde’s advice implicitly (he had distinctly said\r\nthat they would not be able to reach Abyssinia), the road to the ocean\r\nwas the only one that they could take. But according to the calculation\r\nmade by the Swiss, more than a thousand kilometers lay between them and\r\nthe ocean; that is, in a direct line; for by way of Mombasa, which lies\r\nin a more southerly direction, it is farther away, and it would take\r\nmore than three months to make the journey. Stasch was terrified when he\r\nthought that this meant three months of fatigue, excitement, and danger\r\nfrom encounters with tribes of negroes. Now they were still in a barren\r\ncountry, depopulated by smallpox and rumors of attacks by the Dervishes;\r\nbut as, on the whole, Africa is fairly well populated, sooner or later\r\nthey were bound to come to places inhabited by strange tribes, which\r\nwould probably be ruled by savage and treacherous chiefs. It was no easy\r\ntask to retain one’s freedom and one’s life amid such dangers.\r\n\r\nTherefore Stasch calculated that if they could come across the Wa-hima\r\ntribe he would teach several of the warriors how to shoot, and by making\r\ngreat promises would induce them to accompany their party to the ocean.\r\nBut Kali had not the least idea where his tribe lived, and Linde, who\r\nhad heard something about them, could neither tell how to reach them,\r\nnor could he give an exact description of the place where they lived.\r\nLinde had also mentioned having heard about a large lake, and Kali\r\ndistinctly declared the Wa-hima live on one side of this lake, which he\r\ncalled Basso-Narok, on the other side of which the Samburu live. But now\r\nStasch was worried because that lake was not mentioned in the geography\r\nof Africa, which he had studied carefully at school in Port Said. If\r\nKali had been the only one to mention it Stasch would have supposed it\r\nto be Victoria-Nyanza, but Linde could not have made a mistake like that\r\nif he had marched from Victoria Lake northward along the Karamajo\r\nMountains. Stasch came to the conclusion, after questioning the\r\ninhabitants of these mountains, that this mysterious lake ought to lie\r\nfurther to the east and north. Stasch did not know what to think of all\r\nthis; he was also afraid he might miss the lake and come across the\r\nWa-himas or other savage tribes, arid jungles, impassable mountains, the\r\ntsetse-flies, which might kill the animals, the sleeping-sickness, the\r\nfever for Nell, the heat, and worst of all those interminable distances\r\nwhich still separated them from the ocean.\r\n\r\nBut having left Linde Mountain, the only thing to do was to advance\r\nsteadily due east. Linde had said that this was a journey to tax the\r\nstrength of an experienced and energetic explorer to the utmost, but\r\nStasch had already had great experience, and for Nell’s sake he\r\ndetermined not to think of himself and to spare no energy to accomplish\r\nhis purpose. For the present it was necessary to save the girl’s\r\nstrength, and so he decided to travel only between six and ten o’clock\r\nin the morning, and from three to six o’clock in the evening, when there\r\nhappened to be no water at their first halting-place. However, as there\r\nhad been plenty of rain during the rainy season, they found water\r\neverywhere. The small lakes formed on the lowlands by the showers were\r\nstill well filled, and here and there rivers of crystal-clear cold water\r\nflowed from the mountains; these were very inviting to bathe in, and\r\nalso very safe, for crocodiles only live in larger streams where there\r\nare plenty of fish, upon which they chiefly subsist. As Stasch had found\r\na very good filter among Linde’s things, he did not allow the girl to\r\ndrink unfiltered water. The filter always surprised Kali and Mea, for\r\nthey saw that, though filled with clouded and whitish water, only clean\r\nand clear water flowed from it into the reservoir beneath. At this they\r\nlaughed and slapped their knees, to show their pleasure and surprise.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the beginning of their journey was made by easy stages.\r\nThey had received from Linde large supplies of coffee, tea, sugar,\r\nbouillon, various canned goods, and all kinds of medicines. Stasch was\r\nnot sparing of these, for they had more than they could take with them.\r\nThey also had plenty of utensils of all kinds, weapons of various\r\ncaliber, and rockets, which would be of great service when meeting\r\nnegroes. The country was very fertile, and there was plenty of fruit and\r\nfresh meat. In the lowlands they occasionally came across swamps, which\r\nhad not evaporated sufficiently to poison the air with their deadly\r\nodors, being still covered over with water. At this height there were no\r\nmosquitoes to innoculate one with the fever; still, the altitude did not\r\nprevent it from becoming unbearably hot by ten o’clock. The small\r\ntravelers made a halt during the so-called “white hours” in the deep\r\nshade of large trees, through the thick foliage of which not a ray of\r\nsun could penetrate. And so Nell, Stasch, and the negroes kept in\r\nexcellent health.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\nEschinops giganteus grows in this country and is especially abundant in\r\nAbyssinia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\nIn Abyssinia in the Karamajo Mountains, the juniper trees attain a\r\nheight of fifty feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day of their journey Stasch rode with Nell on King, for\r\nthey had come to a broad belt of acacias, which were so thick that the\r\nhorses had to follow in the path made by the elephant. It was now early\r\nin the morning, and the landscape was glistening, fresh with dew. The\r\nchildren talked about the journey, and how every day was bringing them\r\nnearer to their fathers, for both children had never ceased to long for\r\nthem since they were taken from Fayoum; their conversation centered\r\naround this subject, and they always ended by weeping. They repeated\r\nover and over again the same thoughts: their fathers think that they are\r\nnow dead, or that they have disappeared never to return; both are\r\ngrieving, and, although hope is well nigh dead, they send Arabians to\r\nKhartum to try to get news of them, and all this time they are not only\r\nfar away from Khartum, but also from Fashoda—in five days they will be\r\neven further off—then further and further still, and at last they will\r\nreach the ocean, or perhaps before they come to the sea they may reach a\r\nplace where they can send a telegram. The only person in the caravan who\r\nknew what they had before them was Stasch, while Nell was positively\r\nconvinced that there was nothing in the world that he could not achieve,\r\nand she was quite sure that he would bring her to the coast. So she\r\nanticipated events, and planned in her little head more than once what\r\nwould happen when the first news of them should be received. Chirping\r\nlike a little bird, she told Stasch about it. “Our papas,” she said,\r\n“are sitting in Port Said, and they are weeping; then suddenly a boy\r\ncomes in with a telegram. What’s that? Either your papa or mine opens\r\nit, looks at the signature and reads: ‘Stasch and Nell!’ How happy they\r\nare! They will make all haste to meet us! There will be joy in the whole\r\nhouse! Our papas and every one in the house will be happy—they will be\r\ndelighted and will immediately come driving up. I shall fall on papa’s\r\nneck; then we shall always be together, and——”\r\n\r\nAnd the tale ended with Nell’s chin beginning to tremble, her beautiful\r\neyes turning into two fountains, and finally by leaning her little head\r\non Stasch’s shoulder and crying for sorrow, longing, and joy at the\r\nthought of the future meeting. Stasch rather imagined that his father\r\nwould be proud of him and would say to him: “You have acted like a true\r\nPole,” and he was then overcome by emotion, great longing, and\r\nenthusiasm, and an immovable courage, hard as steel, took possession of\r\nhis heart. “I _must_,” he said to himself in these moments, “save Nell.\r\nI _must_ go through these trials.” Then it seemed to him that there were\r\nno dangers he could not face, no obstacles he could not overcome.\r\n\r\nBut the final victory was far off yet. They worked their way through the\r\ngrove of acacias, the long thorns of the bushes tearing even the hide of\r\nthe elephant. Eventually more light penetrated the forest, and through\r\nthe branches of the scattered trees a gray jungle could be seen in the\r\ndistance. Although the heat was very oppressive, Stasch climbed out of\r\nthe palanquin, settled himself on King’s neck, and looked around in\r\nsearch of herds of antelope or zebras, for he determined to provide more\r\nmeat for them to eat.\r\n\r\nTo the right he saw two gazels and beyond them two ostriches. On passing\r\nthe last group of trees the elephant turned off to the left, and then a\r\ndifferent sight presented itself to the boy. Half a kilometer away he\r\nsaw a very large field of manioc, and on the edge of the field several\r\nblack people, apparently busy working.\r\n\r\n“Negroes!” he cried out, turning to Nell.\r\n\r\nHis heart began to beat violently. For a moment he hesitated whether he\r\nshould not return and hide in the acacias, but it occurred to him that\r\nin an inhabited district one must sooner or later be obliged to meet its\r\ninhabitants and have relations with them, and that the fate of their\r\njourney would depend on the nature of these relations; so after quick\r\nreflection he guided the elephant toward the field.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Kali also appeared, and pointing to the group of\r\ntrees, said:\r\n\r\n“Great Man, over there is a negro village, and women are working in the\r\nmanioc fields. Shall I ride to them?”\r\n\r\n“We will ride there together,” answered Stasch, “and then you will tell\r\nthem that we come as friends.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I know what to say to them,” cried the young negro, feeling his\r\ngreat importance.\r\n\r\nTurning his horse toward the workers, he placed his hands trumpet-like\r\nto his mouth and cried:\r\n\r\n“Jambo he! Jambo sana!”\r\n\r\nWhen the women, who were very busy digging up the manioc roots, heard\r\nhis voice, they sprang up and stood as if rooted to the spot; but this\r\nquiet only lasted a moment, for they began to scream and run off toward\r\nthe trees, in the midst of which the village lay, in their excitement\r\nleaving their hoes and rakes behind them.\r\n\r\nThe small wanderers approached this village slowly and silently. The\r\nthicket resounded with the howling of several hundred voices; then\r\nsilence reigned. At last the hollow, penetrating beating of a drum was\r\nheard, which continued incessantly for some time.\r\n\r\nThis was evidently to call the warriors to war, for suddenly more than\r\nthree hundred of them appeared from out of the bushes, and they all\r\nstood in one long line before the village. When a hundred feet distant\r\nStasch brought King to a standstill and began to look at them. The sun\r\nbeat down on their well-formed bodies, on their broad chests, and their\r\nstrong shoulders. They were armed with bows and spears. Around their\r\nhips they wore short skirts of heather or monkey skin. Their heads were\r\nadorned with ostrich and parrot feathers or large wigs made of baboons’\r\nscalps. They looked warlike and menacing, but stood silent and\r\nimmovable, for they were so utterly astonished that their inclination to\r\nfight was kept within bounds. All eyes were fixed on King, on the white\r\npalanquin, and on the white person sitting on the neck of the elephant.\r\n\r\nAnd yet elephants were not strangers to them. On the contrary, they were\r\ncontinually at the mercy of elephants, for at night whole herds would\r\ndestroy their manioc fields and their plantations of bananas and palms.\r\nAs spears and arrows can not pierce an elephant’s hide, the poor negroes\r\nfought against the mischief-makers by means of fire and screams, in\r\nwhich they imitated the crowing of cocks, and they dug out trenches and\r\nmade traps with tree trunks. But they had never seen an elephant made\r\nthe slave of man and allowing him to sit on its neck; and none of them\r\nwas able to account for this extraordinary sight. What they saw so\r\ntranscended their wildest imaginations that they did not know what\r\ncourse to pursue—whether to fight or to run away as fast as their feet\r\ncould carry them and leave the rest to chance. Full of doubt, fear, and\r\nsurprise, they continually whispered to one another:\r\n\r\n“Oh, mother! What are these beings who come here to us, and how will\r\nthey be disposed toward us?”\r\n\r\nKali, who had ridden up to within a spear’s throw of them, raised\r\nhimself up in his stirrups and cried:\r\n\r\n“People, people! Listen to the voice of Kali, the son of Fumba, the\r\npowerful king of the Wa-himas, who live on the banks of the\r\nBasso-Narok— Oh, hear, hear!— And if you understand him, listen to\r\nevery word he is going to say!”\r\n\r\n“We understand,” rang the answer from three hundred throats.\r\n\r\n“Let your king advance, let him tell me his name, and let him open his\r\nears and lips so that he can hear better.”\r\n\r\n“M’Rua! M’Rua!” many voices began to cry out.\r\n\r\nM’Rua stepped out of the rank and file, but took only three steps\r\nforward. He was an aged negro, tall and strongly built, but who\r\nevidently had no courage to spare, for his legs trembled so that he had\r\nto dig the point of his spear into the ground and to lean on its hilt to\r\nkeep from falling.\r\n\r\nOther warriors followed his example, and dug their spears into the\r\nground, as a sign that they wished to listen peacefully to the tidings\r\nof the stranger.\r\n\r\nThereupon Kali declaimed at the top of his voice:\r\n\r\n“M’Rua, and you, M’Rua’s people! You have heard that the son of the king\r\nof the Wa-himas is talking to you, whose cows cover the mountains around\r\nthe Basso-Narok as ants cover the carcass of a dead giraffe. And what is\r\nKali, the son of the king of the Wa-himas, saying? He is telling you a\r\ngreat piece of good news, which is that the ‘good Msimu’ has come to\r\nyour village!”\r\n\r\nThen he cried still louder:\r\n\r\n“So it is—the good Msimu! Doo!”\r\n\r\nFrom the silence that ensued one could readily guess what a tremendous\r\neffect Kali’s words had aroused. The warriors began to separate and then\r\nto form in groups; some advanced a few steps through curiosity, whilst\r\nothers drew back through fear. M’Rua leaned with both hands on his\r\nspear, and for a short time perfect silence ensued, followed by a slight\r\nwhispering through the ranks, and one voice at a time repeated:\r\n\r\n“Msimu! Msimu!” and here and there the cries: “Yancig! Yancig!” which\r\nexpressed admiration and welcome, were to be heard.\r\n\r\nBut Kali’s voice rose again above the noises and screams.\r\n\r\n“Gaze and be happy! The good Msimu is sitting over there in the white\r\nhut on the back of the large elephant, and the large elephant obeys it\r\nlike a slave obeys his master and a child obeys his mother. Oh, neither\r\nyou nor your fathers have ever seen anything like this——”\r\n\r\n“No, no! We have never seen anything like this! Yancig! Yancig!”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of all the warriors turned to the “hut,” in other words, to the\r\npalanquin.\r\n\r\nAnd Kali, who in the course of the religious training he had received on\r\nLinde Mountain had been told that faith can move mountains, was quite\r\nconvinced that the prayer of the white “Bibi” was all powerful with God,\r\nand so he continued to speak, as he thought truthfully, about the good\r\nMsimu.\r\n\r\n“Listen! Listen! The good Msimu is riding on the elephant to that\r\ncountry in which the sun rises out of the water behind the mountains.\r\nThere the good Msimu will tell the Great Spirit to send you clouds, and\r\nthese clouds will, in seasons of drought, water your millet, your\r\nmanioc, your bananas, and the grass in the jungle, so that you will have\r\nplenty to eat, and your cows will have good fodder and will give rich\r\nmilk. Do you, oh people, need food and milk?”\r\n\r\n“He! We need it! We need it!”\r\n\r\n“And the good Msimu will tell the Great Spirit to send you a wind which\r\nwill blow away from your village that sickness which honeycombs the\r\nbody. Do you, oh people, want it to blow the sickness away?”\r\n\r\n“He! Let it blow it away!”\r\n\r\n“And at the prayer of the good Msimu the Great Spirit will protect you\r\nfrom attacks, from slavery, from damage to your fields, from lions, from\r\npanthers, from snakes and from locusts——”\r\n\r\n“He! Let him do it!”\r\n\r\n“Now listen, look and see who sits in front of the hut between the ears\r\nof the terrible elephant. There is Bwana Kubwa, the white man, great and\r\nstrong, whom even the elephant fears.”\r\n\r\n“He!”\r\n\r\n“Who has thunder in his hands and uses it to kill bad men.”\r\n\r\n“He!”\r\n\r\n“Who kills lions.”\r\n\r\n“He!”\r\n\r\n“Who sends up fiery snakes!”\r\n\r\n“He!”\r\n\r\n“Who breaks rocks!”\r\n\r\n“He!”\r\n\r\n“But who will do you no harm if you will respect the good Msimu!”\r\n\r\n“Yancig! Yancig!”\r\n\r\n“And if you will bring him dried banana flour, eggs, fresh milk, and\r\nhoney.”\r\n\r\n“Yancig! Yancig!”\r\n\r\n“Then come nearer and fall on your faces before the good Msimu.”\r\n\r\nM’Rua and his warriors started off, repeating continuously, “Yancig!\r\nYancig!” Then approaching cautiously, they moved a short distance\r\nnearer, for their steps were halted by their superstitious fear of the\r\nMsimu and the elephant. The sight of Saba also filled them with terror,\r\nfor they took him to be a “wobo,” a large golden leopard, inhabiting\r\nthat district and also southern Abyssinia, which the natives fear more\r\nthan a lion because it is especially fond of human flesh, and is even\r\nbold enough to attack armed men. But they were pacified on seeing that\r\nthe little fat-faced negro held the terrible “wobo” by a leash. This\r\ngave them a still higher conception of the power of the good Msimu, and\r\nalso of the white man, and while looking first at the white elephant,\r\nthen at Saba, they whispered to each other: “If they have even bewitched\r\nwobo, who in the world can struggle successfully against them?” But the\r\nmost solemn moment was when Stasch, turning to Nell, bowed low and then\r\npushed back the sides of the palanquin, which were arranged like\r\ncurtains, and showed the good Msimu to the assembled multitude. M’Rua\r\nand every one of the warriors fell on their faces, so that their bodies\r\nformed a long, living bridge. None dared to move, and all hearts were\r\neven more terror-stricken when just at that very moment King, either by\r\norder of Stasch or of his own accord, threw up his trunk and began to\r\ntrumpet very loud, and Saba followed his example in the deepest bass\r\nwhich he could muster. Then there rang out from the hearts of all the\r\nwarriors a cry like a beseeching groaning: “Aka! Aka! Aka!” and this\r\nlasted a long while, until Kali continued:\r\n\r\n“Oh, M’Rua and you children of M’Rua! You have now done reverence before\r\nthe good Msimu; so arise and fill your eyes with the sight of it, for\r\nwhoever does this, over him will be the blessing of the Great Spirit.\r\nBanish all fear from your hearts, and know that where the good Msimu is,\r\nhuman blood can not be shed.”\r\n\r\nAt these words, and especially after the explanation that on account of\r\nthe good Msimu none could be carried away by death, M’Rua stood up, and\r\nthe other warriors followed his example, and they began shyly, but also\r\nwith great curiosity, to gaze at the gracious godhead. If Kali had asked\r\nthem a second time, they would certainly have had to confess that\r\nneither their fathers nor they had ever seen anything like this. For\r\ntheir eyes were accustomed to mask-like, grotesque figures of idols,\r\nmade out of wood and hairy cocoanuts, and now there stood before them on\r\nthe back of the elephant a blonde, gentle, sweet, and smiling godhead,\r\nresembling a white bird and a white flower, and so they gained\r\nconfidence; their hearts breathed freely once more, their thick lips\r\nbegan to smile, and unconsciously stretching their hands out toward the\r\nwonderful apparition, they cried:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Yancig! Yancig! Yancig!”\r\n\r\nBut Stasch, who noticed everything that was going on, perceived as soon\r\nas Kali stopped speaking that a negro, adorned with a pointed cap of\r\nratskin, had slipped out of line, and, gliding along in the grass like a\r\nsnake, had gone in the direction of a solitary hut lying at the rear of\r\nthe enclosure, which was surrounded by a high railing held together by\r\ncreepers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the good Msimu, though greatly embarrassed by being set up as\r\na godhead, put out her little hand at Stasch’s request and greeted the\r\nnegroes. The black warriors, their eyes shining with pleasure, followed\r\nevery movement of this little hand, believing that it possessed a\r\npowerful charm, which would protect them against many misfortunes. Some,\r\nwhilst striking their cheeks and hips, said: “Oh, mother! Now everything\r\nwill go well with us—with us and with our cows!” M’Rua, who had already\r\nbecome quite familiar, approached the elephant, prostrated himself,\r\nstriking the ground with his forehead, before the good Msimu, and whilst\r\nkneeling said to Stasch:\r\n\r\n“Would the Great Man, who leads the white godhead on the elephant, like\r\nto eat a piece of M’Rua and would he agree to let M’Rua eat a piece of\r\nhim, so that we shall be brothers, between whom there is no deceit or\r\ntreason?”\r\n\r\nKali immediately interpreted these words, but as he saw by Stasch’s face\r\nthat the latter had no inclination to taste a “piece” of M’Rua, he\r\nturned to the negro and said:\r\n\r\n“Oh, M’Rua! Do you really think that the white man, who is so powerful\r\nthat the elephant fears him, who has the thunder within his grasp, who\r\nkills lions, before whom wobo wags his tail, who commands fiery snakes\r\nto rise up into the sky, and who shatters rocks—do you think that he\r\ncan pledge blood brotherhood with any king he may happen to meet? But\r\nrather think whether the Great Spirit will not punish you for being so\r\npresumptuous and whether it will not be honor enough for you to eat a\r\npiece of Kali, the son of Fumba, the ruler of the Wa-hima, and Kali, son\r\nof Fumba, to eat a piece of you.”\r\n\r\n“Are you his slave?” asked M’Rua.\r\n\r\n“The Great Man neither stole nor bought Kali, but only saved his life;\r\nthat is why Kali leads the good Msimu and the man into the land of the\r\nWa-hima, so that the Wa-hima and Fumba can show them respect and bring\r\nthem many presents.”\r\n\r\n“Let it be as you say, and M’Rua shall eat a piece of Kali, and Kali a\r\npiece of M’Rua!”\r\n\r\n“So let it be!” repeated the warriors.\r\n\r\n“Where is the sorcerer?” asked the king.\r\n\r\n“Where is the sorcerer? Where is the sorcerer? Where is Kamba?” at once\r\ncried many voices.\r\n\r\nThen something happened that might have completely changed the\r\nsituation, clouded the friendly relations, and converted the negroes\r\ninto the enemies of their newly arrived guests. From the hut which stood\r\napart, surrounded by a special fence, there suddenly came an infernal\r\nnoise. It was like the roar of a lion, the clap of thunder, the blast of\r\ntrumpets, the laugh of a hyena, the howl of a wolf, and the terrible\r\nsqueak of rusty hinges. When King heard these awful sounds he began to\r\nroar, Saba began to bark, and the donkey, on which Nasibu sat, to cry\r\nout “J-a!” The warriors sprang up as if drenched with boiling water and\r\ntore their spears out of the ground. Terrible confusion ensued. The\r\ndisturbing cries of “Our Msimu! Our Msimu!” reached Stasch’s ears, and\r\nthe respect and good-will with which the negroes had looked upon the\r\nnewcomers disappeared in an instant. The savages began to throw\r\nsuspicious and hostile glances around. Amongst the crowd a threatening\r\nnoise was heard and the awful din in the lonely hut increased more and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nKali was troubled, and bending over quickly to Stasch, he began to\r\nwhisper—his voice filled with emotion and fright:\r\n\r\n“Sir, the sorcerer has awakened the bad Msimu, who fears that he will\r\nnot receive any presents, and is roaring with rage. Sir, pacify the\r\nsorcerer and the bad Msimu with generous gifts—otherwise these people\r\nwill turn against us.”\r\n\r\n“Pacify them!” cried Stasch.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly became enraged against the wickedness and covetousness of\r\nthe sorcerer. He was also greatly alarmed at this unlooked-for danger.\r\nThe expression of his tanned face changed, just as it had done when he\r\nshot down Gebhr, Chamis, and the two Bedouins. His eyes shone\r\nthreateningly and he bit his lips, clenched his fists, and his cheeks\r\ngrew pale.\r\n\r\n“Ah! I will soon pacify them!” he said.\r\n\r\nWithout wasting any time, he led the elephant toward the hut.\r\n\r\nKali, who was afraid to remain alone among the negroes, followed him.\r\nThen rose from the warriors a loud cry, whether of fear or rage it was\r\nhard to tell, but before they could regain their composure the railing\r\ncreaked and broke down under the shock of the elephant’s head, the clay\r\nwalls of the hut fell apart, the roof caved in, a cloud of ruins and\r\ndust flew into the air, and after a while M’Rua and his people saw the\r\nlong, black, upturned trunk on the end of which was the sorcerer, Kamba.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  “The People saw the long, black trunk, on the end of\r\nwhich was the sorcerer, Kamba.” ]\r\n\r\nStasch, who saw on the floor of the hut a large drum made out of a\r\nhollowed-out tree, and covered with a monkey-skin, made Kali give it to\r\nhim, and turning around, he stood facing the warriors, looking straight\r\ninto their eyes:\r\n\r\n“Hear, O people!” he said in a loud, resounding voice; “it was not your\r\nMsimu who roared, but only that villain there, who pounds the drum to\r\nwring presents from you, and you are as afraid of him as children!”\r\n\r\nAt these words he took hold of the string which was drawn through the\r\ndried skin of the drum and began to pull at it and twist it with all his\r\nmight. The same sounds which had terrified the negroes before now rang\r\nout again, only much louder, for the walls of the hut did not smother\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how foolish are M’Rua and his children!” cried Kali.\r\n\r\nStasch handed him the drum, and Kali beat so frantically that for a\r\nwhile one could not hear one’s self talk. When he tired of this he threw\r\nthe drum at M’Rua’s feet, and ’mid shrieks of laughter said:\r\n\r\n“That thing is your Msimu!”\r\n\r\nThen, chattering, after the custom of negroes, he addressed the\r\nwarriors, and was by no means sparing in expressing his contempt for\r\nthem and for M’Rua, and in holding them up to ridicule. He pointed to\r\nKamba and explained to them that “this thief in the rat-skin cap” had\r\ndeceived them for many a rainy and dry season, and that they had\r\nrewarded him by feeding him with beans, young goats, and honey. Is it\r\npossible that there could be a more stupid king and a more stupid people\r\nthan these? They believed in the power of an old witch and in his\r\nwitchcraft, and now they see how this great sorcerer hangs from the\r\ntrunk of an elephant and cries “Aka!” begging mercy of the white man.\r\nWhere is his power now? Where is his witchcraft? Why does Msimu not roar\r\nto protect him? Ah, what sort of thing is your Msimu? A strip of monkey\r\nskin and a piece of a rotten tree-trunk, which the elephant has\r\ndestroyed. Neither the women nor the children of the Wa-himas would have\r\nbeen afraid of such a Msimu, and M’Rua and his men were afraid of it!\r\nThere is only one real Msimu and one really great and powerful man, and\r\nto him they ought to show respect and bring as many presents as they\r\ncan, for otherwise they will be afflicted with misfortunes such as they\r\nhad never dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThis harangue to the negroes was quite unnecessary, for the sorcerer\r\nwith his wicked Msimu had proved himself to be weaker than the new god\r\nin such an extraordinary manner, and Stasch satisfied them so well, that\r\nthey forswore their allegiance to the sorcerer and covered him with\r\nshame. Again they cried out, “Yancig!” even more humbly and earnestly\r\nthan before. They were so angry now with themselves for having been\r\ndeceived by Kamba during many years that they insisted on killing him.\r\nM’Rua begged Stasch to let them bind him and keep him until they had\r\ninvented a death of dreadful torture for him. But Nell decided to spare\r\nhis life, and as Kali had told them that no human blood could be shed in\r\npresence of the good Msimu, Stasch only permitted them to drive the\r\nunhappy sorcerer from the village with shame and ignominy.\r\n\r\nKamba, who feared he would be put to death by their cleverly devised\r\ntortures, fell on his face before the good Msimu, and weeping bitterly,\r\nthanked her for his deliverance. From this time forth there was nothing\r\nto mar the awe they inspired. Women and children now came from behind\r\nthe fence, for the news of the extraordinary guest had already spread\r\nthroughout the entire village, and the desire to see the white Msimu was\r\ngreater than their fear of her. For the first time in their lives Stasch\r\nand Nell saw a settlement of real savages, who had never been visited\r\neven by Arabs. The clothing of these negroes consisted only of heather\r\naprons or of a skin wound around the hips, and every one was tattooed.\r\nThe men as well as the women had their ears pierced, and through these\r\nholes they had thrust such long pieces of wood or bone that the lobes of\r\ntheir ears were drawn down to their shoulders. In their lower lips they\r\nwore a lip-ring, a round piece of wood or bone the size of a saucer.\r\nThose of highest rank, such as warriors and their wives, wore around\r\ntheir necks steel or brass wire collars, so high and stiff that they\r\ncould scarcely turn their heads.\r\n\r\nThey evidently belonged to the Schilluk tribe, which reached far toward\r\nthe east, for Kali and Mea knew their language well, and Stasch could\r\nunderstand some things they said. Their legs were not so long as those\r\nof their compatriots who live in the district of the Nile; they were of\r\nshorter stature, their shoulders were broader, and they looked less like\r\nwattle-birds. The children resembled large fleas, and not being\r\ndisfigured by the pelele, they were decidedly better looking than the\r\ngrown people.\r\n\r\nAfter the women had stared long enough at the good Msimu from a\r\ndistance, they vied with the warriors in bringing presents, young goats,\r\nfowls, eggs, black beans, and beer made from millet. This lasted until\r\nStasch forbade them to bring any more. He paid them generously with\r\nglass beads and colored percale, and Nell distributed tiny mirrors among\r\nthe children; and so there was great rejoicing throughout the village\r\nand joyful cries resounded about the tent occupied by the little\r\ntravelers. Then the warriors held a war-dance and a skilfully devised\r\nsham battle in honor of the guests, after which one of the warriors\r\nsuggested the cementing of a bond of fellowship between Kali and M’Rua.\r\n\r\nAs Kamba, who was usually one of the principal figures in such a\r\nceremony, had gone off, an old negro who was very familiar with the\r\nformula took his place. After he had killed a young goat, removed the\r\nliver and divided it in several large pieces, he began to twirl around\r\non hands and feet like a fly-wheel, and looking first at Kali, then at\r\nM’Rua, said in a solemn voice:\r\n\r\n“Kali, the son of Fumba, will you eat a piece of M’Rua, the son of\r\nM’Kuli—and you, M’Rua, son of M’Kuli, will you eat a piece of Kali, the\r\nson of Fumba?”\r\n\r\n“We will!” cried the future brothers.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish that Kali’s heart should be M’Rua’s heart, and M’Rua’s\r\nheart should be Kali’s heart?”\r\n\r\n“We wish it!”\r\n\r\n“And the hands, the spears, and the cows?”\r\n\r\n“And the cows!”\r\n\r\n“And everything which either one possesses now or will possess?”\r\n\r\n“Whatever he possesses and will possess!”\r\n\r\n“And that between you there shall be neither falsehood, treason, nor\r\nhate?”\r\n\r\n“Nor hate!”\r\n\r\n“And that neither of you shall rob the other?”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“And that you are brothers?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\nThe man who was whizzing around like a top turned quicker and quicker.\r\nThe warriors assembled and followed his movements with ever-increasing\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Ao!” cried the old negro once more; “but if one of you lie to the\r\nother, betray him, rob him, poison him, or kill him, he shall be\r\naccursed!”\r\n\r\n“He shall be accursed!” repeated all the warriors.\r\n\r\n“And if he be a liar and contemplate treason, he shall not swallow the\r\nblood of his brother, but spit it out before our eyes?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, before our eyes!”\r\n\r\n“And he shall die!”\r\n\r\n“He shall die!”\r\n\r\n“Wobo shall tear him to pieces!”\r\n\r\n“Wobo!”\r\n\r\n“Or a lion!”\r\n\r\n“Or a lion!”\r\n\r\n“An elephant shall tread him down; yes, and a rhinoceros and buffalo!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, and a buffalo!” repeated the chorus.\r\n\r\n“And a snake shall bite him!”\r\n\r\n“A snake!”\r\n\r\n“And his tongue shall turn black!”\r\n\r\n“Black!”\r\n\r\n“And his eyes shall drop out of his head!”\r\n\r\n“Out of his head!”\r\n\r\n“And he shall walk with his heels in the air!”\r\n\r\n“Ha! with his heels in the air.”\r\n\r\nStasch and Kali had to bite their lips to keep from laughing while still\r\nmore terrible oaths were being repeated, and the “top” turned around so\r\nfast that their eyes could not follow its movements. The old negro kept\r\nthis up until his strength was exhausted and his breath gave out. Then\r\nhe sat down on the ground a while and swayed his head from side to side.\r\nSoon he arose, and grasping a knife, cut Kali’s arm and moistening a\r\npiece of the goat’s liver with his blood, pushed it into M’Rua’s mouth,\r\nand a second piece moistened with the blood of the king he pushed into\r\nKali’s mouth. Both men swallowed the pieces so quickly that a rattling\r\nnoise could be heard in their throats and their eyes nearly started out\r\nof their heads; then they held each other by the hand, as a sign of true\r\nand eternal friendship.\r\n\r\nThen the warriors exclaimed joyfully:\r\n\r\n“Both men have swallowed it! Neither of them spit it out! Therefore they\r\nare sincere and there is no treachery between them.”\r\n\r\nAnd in his heart Stasch thanked Kali for having represented him at this\r\nceremony, for he felt that had he attempted to swallow a piece of M’Rua\r\nhe might have proved himself insincere and a traitor.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the little travelers were in no danger of having snares laid\r\nfor them or of being unexpectedly attacked by the savages; on the\r\ncontrary, the greatest friendship was shown them, and they were almost\r\nworshiped as gods. This worship increased when Stasch, having noticed a\r\ngreat fall in Linde’s barometer, foretold that rain was coming, and on\r\nthat very day it rained quite heavily, as heavily as if the “massika,”\r\nwhich was already over, was trying to squeeze out its last drops on the\r\nearth. The negroes were convinced that the good Msimu had given them\r\nthis shower of rain, and their gratitude to Nell was boundless. Stasch\r\nteased her, saying that now she was the idol of the negroes, he could\r\ncontinue the journey alone, and would leave her behind in the negro\r\nvillage, where the negroes would erect a small chapel of elephants’\r\ntusks for her and would bring her beans and bananas as peace offerings.\r\n\r\nBut Nell felt so sure of his attachment to her that she simply reached\r\nup on her tip-toes and whispered in his ear: “You will not leave me\r\nbehind!” Then she began to hop with joy, declaring that as the negroes\r\nwere so kind the journey to the ocean could be readily and quickly made.\r\nAll this took place in front of the tent before the assembled multitude,\r\nand when old M’Rua saw the Msimu happy, he also began to hop as high as\r\nhis crooked legs would let him, believing that in this way he was\r\ndemonstrating his piety. Following his example, the chief officers began\r\nto dance, and so did the warriors, the women, and children, and in fact\r\nall the inhabitants of the village hopped about as though bereft of\r\ntheir senses. This exhibition given by the “idol” amused Stasch so much\r\nthat he laughed himself almost sick.\r\n\r\nOn the following night he earned the everlasting gratitude of the pious\r\nking and his subjects, for when some elephants raided the banana-fields,\r\nhe rode toward them on King and set off several rockets into their\r\nmidst. The panic which the fiery “snakes” created was even greater than\r\nhe had expected. The enormous animals, dreadfully frightened, filled the\r\nwhole jungle with the sound of their trumpeting and their stamping, and\r\nin blind haste they knocked one another down. The powerful King took\r\ngreat pleasure in following his fleeing comrades, and struck at them\r\nunsparingly with his trunk and tusks. After such a night it would be a\r\nlong time before another elephant would dare approach the banana\r\nplantations of the village ruled over by old M’Rua.\r\n\r\nThe dispersal of the elephants was followed by great rejoicing in the\r\nvillage, and the negroes spent the whole night dancing and drinking\r\nmillet-beer and palm-wine. Kali then learned many important things from\r\nthem, for it so happened that several of them had come from the borders\r\nof a large sheet of water surrounded by mountains and lying toward the\r\neast. This proved to Stasch that the lake, which he had never seen\r\nmentioned in any geography, really existed, and that if they continued\r\nin the same direction they would meet the Wa-himas. From the fact that\r\nMea and Kali spoke almost the same language, he argued that “Wa-hima”\r\nwas probably a local name, and that the tribes living on the banks of\r\nthe Basso-Narok belonged to the Schilluks, whose country extended from\r\nthe Nile far away toward the east. At the time of the Mahdi these places\r\nwere still unexplored.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nThe whole population escorted the good Msimu quite a distance, and took\r\nleave of her with tears in their eyes, at the same time earnestly\r\nbegging her to condescend to visit M’Rua once again and occasionally to\r\nthink of his people. Stasch considered a moment whether he should tell\r\nthe negroes about the gorge where he had hidden the goods and provisions\r\nleft him by Linde, which—on account of the lack of baggage-carriers—he\r\ncould not take with him, but when he realized that the possession of\r\nsuch riches might awaken their covetousness, cause them to be jealous,\r\ndisturb the tranquillity of their lives, and set them to fighting, he\r\ndismissed this idea; but he shot a large buffalo and left them its\r\ncarcass for a parting feast. The sight of such a quantity of “Nyama”\r\nsatisfied them.\r\n\r\nThe next three days the caravan went through a barren stretch of land.\r\nThe days were hot, but the nights, on account of the altitude, were so\r\ncold that Stasch found it necessary to have Nell covered up with two\r\nrugs. They now often passed over narrow mountain passes, sometimes\r\nbarren and hilly, sometimes covered with such thick vegetation that they\r\nhad difficulty in winding their way through them. On the edges of these\r\nravines they saw large monkeys, and here and there also lions and\r\npanthers, which had taken refuge in the rocky caves. At Kali’s request\r\nStasch killed one of the animals, and then Kali put on its skin to\r\nimpress the negroes with the fact that they had to reckon with a person\r\nof kingly blood.\r\n\r\nOn a tableland beyond the narrow passes negro hamlets again appeared.\r\nSometimes they were in groups, sometimes one or two days’ journey apart.\r\nAs a protection against lions all the huts were surrounded by high\r\nfences, so interwoven and overrun with vines that even at a short\r\ndistance they appeared like the undergrowth of a forest. The smoke\r\nrising from the center of the huts was the only indication that they\r\nwere inhabited. The caravan was as welcome everywhere as it had been in\r\nM’Rua’s village, first exciting fear and mistrust, and then surprise,\r\nadmiration, and respect. Only on one occasion did the sight of the\r\nelephant, Saba, the horses and the white people cause an entire village\r\nto flee to the neighboring forest, and therefore the travelers had no\r\nchance of making themselves known. But not a single spear was raised\r\nagainst them, for if the hearts of the negroes are not filled by\r\nMohammedanism with hatred and treachery against unbelievers, they are\r\napt to be timid and peaceful. The travelers were welcomed so heartily\r\nthat Kali had to eat a piece of the village king and the latter a piece\r\nof Kali, whereupon the most friendly relations were consummated. To the\r\ngood Msimu they did homage and showed their reverence by offering fowls,\r\neggs, and honey, brought from hollow blocks of wood, which had been\r\nfastened in the branches of a large tree by means of palm threads. The\r\n“Great Man,” the ruler of the elephant, the thunder, and the fiery\r\nserpent, aroused general terror, which soon gave place to gratitude when\r\nthey were convinced that he was as generous as he was powerful. In\r\nplaces where the small villages were numerous the news of the arrival of\r\nthese extraordinary guests would be communicated to the next settlement\r\nby drum signals, for the negroes announce everything by beating the\r\ndrum. Sometimes the whole population advanced to meet them with friendly\r\ngreetings.\r\n\r\nIn one village of nearly a thousand inhabitants the potentate, who was\r\nat the same time sorcerer and king, expressed his willingness to show\r\nthem the great “fetish,” which was so much reverenced and dreaded that\r\nthe people did not dare to approach the ebony chapel covered with\r\nrhinoceros hide, and so they placed their offerings fifty feet distant.\r\nThe king told Stasch and Nell that this fetish had lately fallen from\r\nthe moon, that it was white and had a tail. Stasch immediately explained\r\nthat the moon had sent it down at the request of the good Msimu, and in\r\nthus speaking he did not deviate from the truth, for it turned out that\r\nthe “great fetish” was simply one of the kites which he had sent up from\r\nLinde Mountain. He and Nell felt very happy when they thought the same\r\nwind might have carried the others still farther, and he decided to\r\ncontinue sending up more from the hill-tops. That evening he made a kite\r\nand let it fly, which convinced the negroes that the good Msimu and the\r\nwhite man had also come down from the moon and were gods to be served\r\nwith humility.\r\n\r\nThough pleased with these demonstrations of humility and adoration,\r\nStasch was much more delighted on hearing that the Basso-Narok was a\r\nlittle more than ten days’ journey distant, and that the inhabitants of\r\nthe village in which they now lived often received salt from that\r\ncountry in return for palm-wine. The village king had even heard Fumba\r\nspoken of as being the ruler of people called “Doko.” Kali said that the\r\nneighbors living a short distance away gave this name to the Wa-hima and\r\nSamburu.\r\n\r\nThe news that a great war was now raging on the banks of this vast sheet\r\nof water was not very reassuring, for in consequence of this it would be\r\nnecessary to reach the Basso-Narok by marching over wild mountains and\r\nthrough deep ravines infested by beasts of prey. But Stasch was no\r\nlonger afraid of such beasts, and he preferred the wildest mountains to\r\nthe low plains, where fever lurked. So they courageously continued their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving that large village they passed but one other, a small\r\nsettlement, that hung like a nest on the edge of a precipice. Then the\r\ncountry became mountainous, the hills in places being separated by deep\r\nravines. To the east rose a dark chain of mountain-peaks, which, seen\r\nfrom a distance, looked quite black. They were now traveling through an\r\nunexplored stretch of country, and so they could not tell what might\r\nhappen to them before they reached Fumba’s land. On the mountain slopes\r\nthere were plenty of bananas, but with the exception of the dragon-tree\r\nand acacias, which stood out by themselves, the trees grew in groups,\r\nforming small groves. The travelers often halted in these groves to rest\r\nand renew their strength, as well as to enjoy the abundant shade.\r\n\r\nThe trees swarmed with birds. Many different species—large rhinoceros\r\nbirds (which Stasch called pepper-eaters), roller, starling,\r\nlaughing-dove, and countless beautiful “bengalis”—fluttered in the\r\nthick foliage or flew from one grove to another, singly or in groups,\r\nglittering in every color of the rainbow. Many trees, seen from a\r\ndistance, appeared to be covered with colored flowers. Nell was\r\nparticularly delighted on seeing flycatchers[30] and large black birds\r\nwith bright red feathers on their breasts, whose voices sounded like a\r\nshepherd’s flute.[31] Beautiful bee-eaters, pink on top and pale-blue\r\nunderneath, glistened in the sunlight, catching bees and dragonflies\r\nwhile on the wing. The screams of green parrots could be heard from the\r\ntree-tops, as could a sound of silver bells, the mutual greetings of\r\nsmall, gray-green birds hidden in the foliage.\r\n\r\nBetween sunset and dawn such large flocks of native sparrows[32] flew\r\npast that but for their chirping and the flapping of their wings they\r\nmight have been mistaken for clouds, and Stasch would have thought that\r\nthe songsters who made the trees vocal during the day were humming\r\nthroughout the night.\r\n\r\nBut the children were still more surprised and delighted with some other\r\nbirds which flew in flocks and sang delightfully. Each group consisted\r\nof five or six females and one male, with glittering, metal-like\r\nfeathers. They alighted on acacias—the male perching on the top of the\r\ntree, while the females sat on the lower branches—and after the first\r\nnotes, which sounded as though he were tuning his voice, the male began\r\nto sing, while the females listened in silence. When he had finished\r\nthey repeated in unison the last refrain of his song. After a brief\r\npause he would begin again, and when he had ended they would again\r\nrepeat the refrain; then the flock would fly in an airy, wave-like line\r\nto the next acacia, and the concert of soloist and chorus would ring out\r\nonce more through the silence of noon. The children never grew tired of\r\nlistening. Nell would catch the notes and join the chorus, twittering\r\nthe last tones in her little thin voice, which sounded like a quick\r\nrepetition of the sounds, “tui, tui, tui, tui, twi-ling-ting, ting!”\r\nOnce, when they were following the winged songsters from one tree to\r\nanother, the children found that they were alone and nearly a kilometer\r\naway from their camping-place, for they had left the three negroes and\r\nKing and Saba behind. Stasch, who had planned to go hunting, had not\r\nwanted to take Saba for fear he might bark and frighten the game. When\r\nthe flock of birds had flown from the last acacia to the other side of\r\nthe broad ravine, the young boy stood still and said:\r\n\r\n“Now I shall take you back to King, and then I shall see if there are\r\nany antelopes or zebras in the high jungle, for Kali says we have only\r\nenough smoked meat to last two days.”\r\n\r\n“But I am a big girl now,” answered Nell, who was always desirous of\r\nshowing that she was no longer a little girl, “and therefore I will\r\nreturn by myself. The camp and the smoke can easily be seen from here.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid you might get lost.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not get lost. In the high jungle I might, but here—look how\r\nlow the grass is.”\r\n\r\n“Something might attack you!”\r\n\r\n“You said that lions and panthers do not hunt their prey in the daytime.\r\nBesides, do you hear how King is trumpeting because he is lonesome for\r\nus? What lion would dare to hunt where King’s voice is heard?”\r\n\r\nAnd she began to coax and in fact to be quite insistent on going.\r\n\r\n“No, Stasch, I shall go alone. Remember, I am grown up!”\r\n\r\nStasch at first hesitated, but in the end let her have her own way. The\r\ncamp and the smoke of the campfire could be distinctly seen, and King,\r\nwho was lonesome without Nell, trumpeted continually. As Nell had said,\r\nthere was no fear of getting lost in the low grass, and as far as lions,\r\npanthers, and hyenas were concerned, they need not be taken into\r\nconsideration, for these beasts hunt their prey only at night. Besides,\r\nhe knew he could do nothing to please the girl more than to show her\r\nthat he no longer considered her a child.\r\n\r\n“Well, all right,” he said; “go alone, but walk straight ahead and do\r\nnot stop on the way.”\r\n\r\n“But may I pick these flowers myself?” she asked, pointing to a bush of\r\nkousso,[33] which was covered with a heavy mass of pink flowers.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you may!”\r\n\r\nWith these words he turned around, and after taking the precaution of\r\nshowing her the group of trees from which the smoke issued and from\r\nwhich King’s trumpeting was heard, he disappeared into the high jungle\r\nat the edge of the ravine.\r\n\r\nHe had taken scarcely a hundred steps when he felt exceedingly anxious.\r\n“It was very stupid of me,” he thought, “to let Nell go alone in the\r\nheart of Africa—how foolish, foolish! She is still a child! I should\r\nnot have left her side even for an instant unless King had been with\r\nher. Who knows what may happen? Who knows whether there is not a snake\r\nunder that pinkish shrubbery, or large monkeys might come from this\r\nnarrow pass and carry her off or bite her. Heaven help me! I have done a\r\nmost foolish thing!”\r\n\r\nInstead of being only uneasy, he now became angry with himself and\r\nterribly frightened. Without reasoning further, he turned back, as\r\nthough with a foreboding of evil. He stepped quickly to one side, and,\r\nas a matter of habit, formed in his daily hunting expeditions, he held\r\nhis gun ready to shoot and glided through the prickly mimosas as\r\nsilently as a panther creeping upon an antelope herd at night. Then he\r\nthrust his head above the tall shrubbery—and stood there as if\r\npetrified.\r\n\r\nNell was standing under the kousso bush with hands extended; the pinkish\r\nflowers, which she had dropped in her dismay, lay at her feet, and about\r\ntwenty feet away a large golden-yellow animal was creeping toward her\r\nthrough the low grass.\r\n\r\nStasch distinctly saw its green eyes fixed on the chalk-white face of\r\nthe girl, he saw its bowed head and flattened ears, its upraised paw\r\nstretched forward, expressing its waiting and stealthy attitude, its\r\nlong body and even longer tail, the end of which was moving with an\r\nalmost imperceptible cat-like movement. Another moment—a spring—and it\r\nwould have been the last of Nell!\r\n\r\nAt this sight the boy, accustomed as he was to danger, at once realized\r\nthat if he did not immediately regain his composure and presence of\r\nmind, if he were to shoot and merely wound the animal, no matter how\r\nbadly, the girl would be doomed. Controlling himself, and stimulated by\r\nthese thoughts, his arms and legs suddenly became as rigid as steel.\r\nThanks to his habit of observation, he noticed a dark spot near the\r\nanimal’s ear, took aim, and pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant came the report of the shot, a scream from Nell, and\r\na dreadful growl. Stasch sprang in front of Nell, and while protecting\r\nher with his own body took aim again.\r\n\r\nThe second shot was quite unnecessary. The terrible cat lay stretched\r\nout like a rag, its nose on the ground, its paws in the grass, and it\r\nnever even twitched. The bullet, an explosive one, had torn away the\r\nentire back of the head and neck, above which the eyes glared and the\r\nbloody, torn ganglia of the brain could be seen.\r\n\r\nThe little huntsman and Nell stood for a moment side by side, looking\r\nfirst at the slain beast, then at each other—speechless. Then a strange\r\nthing happened. Stasch, whose self-possession and calmness would have\r\nastonished the most experienced marksman, suddenly turned pale, his legs\r\nbegan to tremble, tears started from his eyes, he put his hands to his\r\nhead and repeated over and over again:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Nell, Nell, if I had not turned back!”\r\n\r\nHere he was seized with terror, a terror bordering on despair, and every\r\nnerve in his body twitched and trembled as if he had an attack of ague.\r\nAfter his tremendous mental and bodily tension there came a moment of\r\nweakness and lassitude. He imagined he saw the terrible beast lying in a\r\ndark cave tearing Nell’s body to pieces with its bloody mouth. And\r\nindeed this might really have happened—it would have happened had he\r\nnot turned back. A moment, a second more, and it would have been too\r\nlate. These thoughts were too much for him to bear.\r\n\r\nThe result was that Nell, who was the first to recover from the fright,\r\nwas obliged to comfort him. The dear little child threw both her small\r\narms around his neck and wept, crying out as loudly as though trying to\r\nawaken him out of a sound sleep.\r\n\r\n“Stasch! Stasch! Nothing has happened to me! Only look and see! Nothing\r\nhas happened to me! Little Stasch! Dear Stasch!”\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Stasch recovered his composure and calmness.\r\nSoon after Kali arrived on the scene; he had heard a shot near the camp,\r\nand knowing that Bwana Kubwa never shot in vain, he immediately brought\r\na horse to carry away the game. But when the young negro saw the slain\r\nbeast he suddenly drew back and his face became ashen-gray.\r\n\r\n“Wobo!” he screamed.\r\n\r\nNot until now did the children approach the stiffening carcass, for\r\nStasch as yet had no definite idea of the kind of beast he had shot. At\r\nfirst sight the boy thought it might be a very large “serval,”[34] but\r\non taking a nearer view he knew that he was mistaken, for the dead beast\r\nwas even larger than a leopard. Its golden-yellow skin was dotted with\r\nchestnut-brown spots; but its head was narrower than that of a leopard\r\nand resembled somewhat that of a wolf; its legs were longer, its paws\r\nbroader, and its eyes enormous. One of them had been completely torn\r\naway by the bullet; the second still stared at the children as if out of\r\na chasm, immovable, frightful. Stasch felt sure that it was some species\r\nof panther which zoologists knew as little about as geographers did of\r\nthe Basso-Narok Sea.\r\n\r\nKali continued to gaze with terror at the outstretched animal, repeating\r\nin an undertone, as if afraid to awaken it:\r\n\r\n“Wobo!—The Great Man has killed a wobo!”\r\n\r\nBut Stasch, turning to the girl, laid his hand on her little head, as if\r\nhe wanted to make sure that wobo had not stolen her, and said:\r\n\r\n“Do you see, Nell, do you see that even if you were quite grown up, you\r\nought not to go alone in the jungle?”\r\n\r\n“You are right, Stasch,” answered Nell with a penitent expression. “But\r\nmay I go with you or with King?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, how did this happen? Did you hear it approach you?”\r\n\r\n“No. A large golden fly flew out of the flowers, so I turned around\r\ntoward it, and then I saw the beast just as it was creeping out from the\r\nravine.”\r\n\r\n“And what happened next?”\r\n\r\n“It stood still and began to look at me.”\r\n\r\n“Did it look at you long?”\r\n\r\n“Long! It was only when I dropped the flowers and covered my face with\r\nmy hands to protect myself that it began to creep up——”\r\n\r\nStasch knew that if Nell had been a negress she would have been carried\r\noff at once, and that she owed her deliverance to the surprise of the\r\nanimal, which was disconcerted for a moment on the first sight of a\r\ncreature so different from the people he had seen.\r\n\r\nAgain the boy shivered from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“Thank heaven! Thank heaven that I turned back!”\r\n\r\nThen he inquired further:\r\n\r\n“What were you thinking of at that moment?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted to call you, and—did not dare—but——”\r\n\r\n“But—what?”\r\n\r\n“But I thought that you would certainly defend me. I don’t know——”\r\n\r\nAt these words she threw her arm around his neck once more, and he began\r\nto stroke her hair.\r\n\r\n“Are you not afraid now?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“My little Msimu! my Msimu! You see now what Africa is!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But you will kill all the vicious animals.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, so I will!”\r\n\r\nBoth took another look at the beast of prey. Stasch, who wished to keep\r\nits skin as a souvenir, told Kali to skin it, but the negro was afraid\r\nthat a second wobo might appear from out of the ravine, and he begged\r\nnot to be left there alone, and when asked whether he was really more\r\nafraid of a wobo than he was of a lion he said:\r\n\r\n“A lion roars in the night and does not jump over a fence, but a wobo\r\njumps over it in broad daylight, kills many negroes in the very heart of\r\nthe village, and then steals one and eats him. Neither a spear nor a bow\r\nis any protection against a wobo, for a wobo can’t be killed.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” said Stasch; “look at this one; isn’t it quite dead?”\r\n\r\n“White man can kill a wobo, but not black man!” answered Kali.\r\n\r\nAt last they took a rope and tied the enormous cat to the horse, and the\r\nlatter dragged it toward the camp.\r\n\r\nBut Stasch was unable to keep the skin, because King, who apparently\r\nguessed that the wobo had attempted to steal his little mistress, flew\r\ninto such a rage that even Stasch was unable to pacify him. Grasping the\r\nslain beast with his trunk, he threw it twice into the air, then he\r\nbegan to beat it against a tree, and at last stamped it under his feet\r\nuntil it was a pulpy, formless mass. Stasch was only able to save its\r\nteeth, which with some other parts of its head he had laid down in the\r\npath of a swarm of ants, and an hour later they had cleaned up the bones\r\nso thoroughly that there was not a sign of flesh or of blood to be seen.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\nTerpsichore viridis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\nLaniarius erythrogaster.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\nQuelia Æthiopica.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\nBrojera Anthelmitica is a beautiful plant, the seeds of which are a\r\nvaluable remedy for tapeworm. It is mostly found in Southern Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\nA grey animal the size of a lynx, a species of tiger-cat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nFour days later Stasch made a halt on a plateau that, although smaller\r\nand narrower than Linde Mountain, bore a great resemblance to it. That\r\nvery evening Saba attacked a large baboon as he was playing with the\r\nremains of a kite—the second of those which the children had sent up\r\nbefore they started to travel toward the ocean—and after a hard fight\r\nbit him to death. Stasch and Nell, profiting by the halt to rest\r\nthemselves, decided to continue making kites, but to send them up only\r\nwhen a strong monsoon was blowing from the west toward the east. Stasch\r\ncalculated that if but one of them were to fall into the hands of\r\nEuropeans or Arabians it would certainly excite unusual interest, and\r\nmight be the means of a special expedition sent out to seek them. That\r\nhis message might stand a better chance of being understood, he wrote on\r\nthe kites not only in English and French, but also in Arabic, which was\r\nnot difficult for him, as he was familiar with that language. Shortly\r\nafter they broke up camp here Kali said that in the chain of mountains\r\nwhich they saw toward the east he recognized many peaks as those which\r\nsurround the large sheet of dark water, the Basso-Narok, but he was not\r\nquite positive, because the mountains assume different shapes, according\r\nto the position of the observer. After having passed a fairly broad\r\nvalley covered with kousso bushes, that resembled a large pink sea, they\r\ncame upon a solitary negro hut, inside of which were two hunters, one of\r\nwhom was ill, having been bitten by a guinea-worm.[35] Both were so\r\nsavage and stupid, so dismayed at the sight of these unexpected guests,\r\nand so certain that they intended to kill them, that at first they would\r\ngive no information. It took a few strips of smoked meat to loosen the\r\ntongue of the sick man, who, besides being ill, was half starved, as his\r\ncomrade allowed him but little food. From him they learned that one\r\nday’s journey farther on there were some scattered hamlets, which were\r\ngoverned by two chiefs independent of each other, and that farther on,\r\nbehind a steep mountain, lay the Fumba country, which extends from this\r\ngreat sheet of water toward the west and south. When Stasch heard this\r\nhe felt that a great load had been lifted from him, and he took courage\r\nonce more. For were they not near the boundary of the land belonging to\r\nthe Wa-hima tribe?\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, hard to tell how they would find the remainder of the\r\njourney, but in any event the boy had reason to hope that it would not\r\nbe more fatiguing or longer than the terrible ride from the banks of the\r\nNile to the plain where they now were, which distance he had\r\naccomplished, thanks to his wonderful quickness of action, and during\r\nwhich time he had saved Nell from death. He knew that the Wa-hima would\r\nwelcome them most hospitably for Kali’s sake, and would assist them in\r\nevery way. Besides, he was accustomed to negroes, and knew how to manage\r\nthem; so he felt pretty sure he could get along with them even without\r\nKali.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” he said to Nell, “that we have already covered more than\r\nhalf the distance between Fashoda and the sea, and during the remainder\r\nof our journey we may meet more savage negroes, but we are free from the\r\nDervishes?”\r\n\r\n“I prefer negroes,” answered the girl.\r\n\r\n“Yes, as long as you pass for an idol. I was stolen from Fayoum along\r\nwith a girl called Nell, and now I am bringing a Msimu home. I shall\r\ntell my father and Mr. Rawlison that they are not to call you by any\r\nother name.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes began to twinkle merrily.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we shall see our papas in Mombasa!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. If it were not for the war raging on the banks of the\r\nBasso-Narok, we might accomplish our journey sooner. How provoking that\r\nFumba should go to war just at this time!”\r\n\r\nAt these words he beckoned to Kali.\r\n\r\n“Kali, has the sick negro heard anything about a war?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. There is a great, a very great war between Fumba and Samburu.”\r\n\r\n“Then what will happen? How can we travel through the Samburu land?”\r\n\r\n“The Samburu will run away from the great man, from King and from Kali.”\r\n\r\n“And from you?”\r\n\r\n“And from Kali, for Kali has a gun that thunders and kills.”\r\n\r\nStasch began to consider what part he would have to take in the war\r\nbetween the Wa-hima and Samburu tribes; he determined that the war\r\nshould not interfere with their journey. He knew that their arrival\r\nwould be a great surprise, and that it would give Fumba the upper hand.\r\nTherefore, all he need do would be to turn the prospective victory to\r\nhis own advantage.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in the small villages of which the sick hunter had made\r\nmention, they made further inquiries in regard to the war. And the news\r\nbecame more and more reliable, but at the same time unfavorable to\r\nFumba. The small travelers learned that he was on the defensive, and\r\nthat the Samburu, led by Mamba, their king, had taken a considerable\r\nportion of the Wa-hima’s country and captured a great many cows. It was\r\nsaid that the seat of war was on the south bank of the large sheet of\r\nwater, where Fumba’s great “boma”[36] was situated, on a high and broad\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nThis news made Kali feel very sad. He begged Stasch to travel as fast as\r\nhe could over the mountain which separated them from the district that\r\nwas menaced by the war, and he promised to find a road over which they\r\ncould lead King as well as the horses. They were now in a country with\r\nwhich Kali was very familiar, and he recognized the mountain peaks he\r\nhad known since childhood.\r\n\r\nBut it was no easy matter to cross the mountain, and if they had not\r\nbeen assisted by the inhabitants of the last village, whose good favor\r\nthey had won with gifts, they would have had to find another road for\r\nKing. But these people knew the ravines on this side of the mountain\r\nbetter than Kali did, and after a wearisome journey of two days and two\r\nnights, during which they suffered greatly from the cold, they were\r\neventually able to lead the caravan over a narrow pass into a valley\r\nwhich from its appearance seemed to belong to the land of the Wa-himas.\r\n\r\nStasch made a halt to take a rest in this barren valley, which was\r\nenclosed by shrubbery, but Kali, who begged to be allowed to go on\r\nhorseback to reconnoiter in the direction of his father’s boma, which\r\nlay a day’s journey distant, started off that very night. Stasch and\r\nNell anxiously awaited his return for a whole following day and night,\r\nand they felt convinced that his strength must have given out, or that\r\nhe must have fallen into the hands of the enemy. At last he reappeared\r\non his weary and panting horse, he himself so tired and depressed that\r\nit made one sad to see him.\r\n\r\nHe prostrated himself at Stasch’s feet and begged him to come to the\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Great Man,” he said, “the Samburu have conquered Fumba’s warriors\r\nand killed several of them, and those they have not killed they have\r\ndriven out; and they are besieging Fumba in the great ‘boma’ on Boko\r\nMountain. Fumba and his warriors have nothing to eat on the mountain and\r\nwill perish if the Great Man does not kill Mamba and all the Samburus.”\r\n\r\nWhile begging, he clasped Stasch’s knees; the latter frowned and\r\nconsidered what he should do, for, as always, Nell was his first\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAt length he asked, “Where are the warriors of Fumba whom the Samburus\r\nhave dispersed?”\r\n\r\n“Kali found them—and they will soon be here.”\r\n\r\n“How many of them are there?”\r\n\r\nThe young negro moved his fingers and toes several times, but apparently\r\nhe could not give the exact number, for the simple reason that he could\r\nnot count further than ten, and that every higher number was “wengi,”\r\nwhich means “many.”\r\n\r\n“When they come, put yourself at their head and hasten to the relief of\r\nyour father,” said Stasch.\r\n\r\n“They are afraid of the Samburus and would not go with Kali, but they\r\nwould go with the Great Man and kill wengi, wengi Samburus.”\r\n\r\nStasch thought the matter over once more.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said at last. “I can neither take Bibi to the battle nor leave\r\nher behind alone; nothing would tempt me to do it.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Kali arose, folded his hands, and began repeating over and\r\nover again:\r\n\r\n“Lunla! Lunla! Lunla!”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by Lunla?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“A great boma for the wives of the Wa-himas and the Samburus,” answered\r\nthe young negro.\r\n\r\nAnd he began to tell quite wonderful tales. For Fumba and Mamba had been\r\nat war with each other for several years. They had destroyed each\r\nother’s plantations and stolen each other’s cattle. But on the south\r\nbank of the lake there was a place called Lunla, in which—even during\r\nthe hardest battles—the women of both tribes assembled to hold their\r\nmarket. This place was sacred. The war only raged between the men; the\r\nfortunes of war did not affect the destiny of the women, who found a\r\nsafe refuge in Lunla, their spacious market-place, which was enclosed by\r\nearthworks. During these disturbances many of them fled there with their\r\nchildren and possessions. Some came from even the most distant villages,\r\nbringing smoked meat, beans, millet, manioc, and various other kinds of\r\nprovisions. The warriors were not allowed to battle nearer Lunla than\r\nwithin earshot of the crowing of a cock, and they were not allowed\r\nwithin the earthworks which encircled the market-place. They could only\r\nstand in front of the wall, and then the women handed them down\r\nprovisions by means of long bamboo rods. This was an old-fashioned\r\ncustom respected by both parties. But the victorious side always tried\r\nto hold the road to Lunla so as to prevent the vanquished from\r\napproaching near enough to the sacred place to hear the cock crow.\r\n\r\n“Oh Great Man,” begged Kali once more, as he clasped Stasch’s knee, “the\r\nGreat Man will bring Bibi to Lunla, and he will take King and Kali and\r\nthe gun and the fiery snakes and he will conquer the wicked Samburus.”\r\n\r\nStasch believed the young negro’s story, for he had heard that in many\r\nparts of Africa women are not affected by the wars. He remembered that a\r\nyoung German missionary in Port Said had once told him that the most\r\nwarlike tribe of Masai, living in the vicinity of the great Kilima Njaro\r\nMountain, followed this custom, and that consequently the wives of the\r\nwarriors on either side could pass freely and unmolested to the\r\nmarket-place agreed upon without fear of being attacked.[37] Stasch was\r\nmuch pleased that this custom still prevailed on the banks of the\r\nBasso-Narok, for he felt confident that Nell would not be in any danger\r\nfrom the war. He also concluded to break up camp at once and take Nell\r\nto Lunla, which he was particularly desirous of doing, because a further\r\njourney was out of the question until the war was over, and the help of\r\nboth the Wa-himas and the Samburus was necessary.\r\n\r\nAccustomed as he was to make quick decisions, Stasch knew at once what\r\nto do. To release Fumba, to conquer the Samburus, to prevent the\r\nWa-himas from taking too bloody a revenge, to command peace and reunite\r\nthe antagonists seemed to him absolutely necessary, not only for his own\r\nsake, but also for the negroes. “It must be accomplished and it shall\r\nbe!” he said to himself, and in the meanwhile, to pacify Kali, for whom\r\nhe felt much sympathy, he explained to him that he by no means refused\r\nhis assistance.\r\n\r\n“How far is it from here to Lunla?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Half a day’s journey.”\r\n\r\n“Then listen. We will take Bibi there at once; then I will ride on King\r\nand drive the Samburus from your father’s boma. You will ride with me\r\nand fight against them.”\r\n\r\n“Kali will kill them with the gun.”\r\n\r\nHis despair changed to joy at once; he began to hop, to laugh, and to\r\nthank Stasch with as much enthusiasm as if the victory were already won.\r\nFurther outbursts of gratitude and joy were interrupted by the arrival\r\nof the warriors he had collected during his reconnoitering, and whom he\r\nhad commanded to appear before the white man. There were about thirty\r\nmen, armed with shields of hippotamus skins, darts, bows, and knives.\r\n\r\nOn their heads they wore feathers, manes of baboons, and bouquets of\r\nferns. On beholding an elephant in the service of a human being, on\r\nseeing Saba and the horses, they were seized with fear and surprise,\r\njust as was the case with the negroes in the villages through which the\r\ncaravan had previously passed. But Kali had already told them that they\r\nwould see a good Msimu and a powerful man, “who kills lions, who killed\r\na wobo, of whom the elephant is afraid, who breaks rocks, makes fiery\r\nsnakes rise in the air, etc.” So instead of running away, they formed in\r\na long line and stood there silent and astonished, the whites of their\r\neyes gleaming, for they were still uncertain whether they ought to kneel\r\ndown or fall on their faces, but they firmly believed that, with the\r\nhelp of these extraordinary beings, the triumph of the Samburus would\r\nsoon be at an end. Stasch rode on the elephant through the rank and file\r\nof the standing warriors like the leader of an army holding a review;\r\nthen he made Kali repeat his promise to release Fumba, and gave orders\r\nto break camp for Lunla.\r\n\r\nKali rode in front with several warriors to tell the assembled wives of\r\nboth tribes that they were to have rarer good fortune than ever before,\r\nin seeing the “good Msimu,” who was coming to them riding on an\r\nelephant. This was such an extraordinary occurrence that even those\r\nwomen of the Wa-hima tribe who recognized Kali as the lost heir to the\r\nthrone thought that the king’s young son was trying to make fun of them,\r\nand they were surprised that he attempted to joke when the whole tribe\r\nand Fumba were in such desperate straits. But several hours later, when\r\nan enormous elephant with a white palanquin on his back was seen\r\napproaching the earthworks, they were nearly beside themselves with joy,\r\nand welcomed the good Msimu with such shouts and howls that Stasch\r\nmistook the uproar for outbursts of hatred, especially as these negroes\r\nwere so hideously ugly that they looked like witches.\r\n\r\nBut this was their way of showing their great admiration. When Nell’s\r\ntent was set up in a corner of the market-place, in the shade of two\r\ntrees with luxuriant foliage, the Wa-hima and the Samburu women adorned\r\nit with garlands and wreaths of flowers; then they brought such a\r\nquantity of food that it was not only enough for the goddess herself,\r\nbut also enough to last her retinue for a month. The delighted women\r\neven bowed before Mea, who was adorned with pink percale and several\r\nstrings of blue glass beads, and for this reason, and also because she\r\nwas Msimu’s servant, she seemed to them to be of much higher rank than\r\nan ordinary negress.\r\n\r\nNasibu, on account of his youth, was also allowed within the enclosure,\r\nand he immediately profited by the offerings brought to Nell, and\r\napplied himself so conscientiously to eating that an hour later his\r\nlittle stomach resembled an African war-drum.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\nMedinensis, a thin string-worm, from an inch to a yard in length; its\r\nbite sometimes causes gangrene.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\nsame as the zareba in the Soudan. A large boma may also be a kind of\r\ncastle or fortified camp.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\nactual fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nAfter resting a little while before the earthworks of Lunla, Stasch\r\nstarted off before sunset with Kali at the head of three hundred\r\nwarriors to go to Fumba’s boma, for he wanted to attack the Samburus by\r\nnight, reckoning that in the darkness the “fiery snakes” would make a\r\ngreater impression. The journey from Lunla to Boko Mountain, on which\r\nFumba was besieged, would take nine hours, counting the halt for rest,\r\nso that they would arrive before the fortress about three o’clock in the\r\nmorning. Stasch made the warriors halt and commanded them to be silent;\r\nthen he began to inspect the situation. The summit of the hill on which\r\nthe defenders were waiting in ambush was wrapped in darkness, but the\r\nSamburus kept several campfires burning. Their light illuminated the\r\nsteep sides of the cliff and the giant trees growing at its feet. And\r\nnow from a distance could be heard the hollow sound of kettle-drums, as\r\nwell as the shouts and singing of the warriors, who apparently were not\r\nsparing of the pombe[38] while celebrating their final victory. Stasch,\r\nat the head of his men, advanced still further, so that at last he was\r\nnot more than a hundred feet from the last campfires. There seemed to be\r\nno one on guard anywhere, and the moonless night made it impossible for\r\nthe savages to see the elephant, which was also hidden by the foliage.\r\nStasch, sitting on King’s neck, gave his final orders in a low tone of\r\nvoice, and made a sign to Kali to set off one of the rockets.\r\n\r\nA red streak spluttered, shot high up into the sky, and fell in a shower\r\nof red, blue, and golden stars. Then every voice ceased and a moment of\r\nsilence ensued. A few seconds later two more fiery snakes ascended,\r\nmaking a crackling sound, and this time directed more horizontally\r\ntoward the Samburus’ camp; at the same time there were heard King’s\r\ntrumpeting and the howls of three hundred Wa-himas, who, armed with\r\nassegais,[39] clubs, and knives, came up on the run. The battle that\r\nensued was all the more terrible because it took place in absolute\r\ndarkness, for in the excitement all the campfires had been extinguished\r\nand trampled down. From the first moment that the Samburus saw the fiery\r\nsnakes they were panic-stricken. What had taken place was absolutely\r\nbeyond their comprehension. They only knew that some sort of terrible\r\ncreatures had overtaken them and that fearful and inevitable destruction\r\nthreatened them. Most of them fled before the spears and clubs of the\r\nWa-himas touched them. Over a hundred warriors whom Mamba had gathered\r\naround him defended themselves despairingly, but when by the light of\r\nthe shots they saw a giant animal and on it a being dressed in white,\r\nand heard the reports of the gun which Kali incessantly fired, they lost\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nWhen Fumba, who was on the mountain, saw the first rocket burst in the\r\nair above him, he fell to the ground from fright and lay there several\r\nminutes as if lifeless. On recovering, he concluded, from the despairing\r\nhowls of the warriors, that some kind of supernatural beings were\r\nslaying the Samburus. Then he thought that if he did not come to the\r\nassistance of these spirits their rage might also be turned against him,\r\nand as the destruction of the Samburus meant his deliverance, he\r\ncollected all his warriors and crept out of the boma by means of a\r\nhidden side passage, and thus quickly reached most of those trying to\r\nescape. The fight thus changed into a slaughter. The kettle-drums of the\r\nSamburus ceased to rumble. The darkness was penetrated only by the red\r\nflashes from Kali’s gun, the shrieks of dying warriors, the groans of\r\nthe wounded, and the hollow beating of clubs on shields rang through the\r\nair. No one begged for quarter, for the negroes know no mercy.\r\n\r\nFor fear of hitting his own people in the confusion and darkness, Stasch\r\nat last ceased firing, and grasping Gebhr’s sword, threw himself on the\r\nenemy. The Samburus could now escape from the mountains to the frontier\r\nonly by passing through a broad ravine, but Fumba and his warriors\r\nblocked this narrow pass, and every one of the fugitives was slain save\r\nthose who threw themselves on the ground and surrendered, though they\r\nknew that cruel slavery or immediate death awaited them from the\r\nconquerors. Mamba defended himself heroically until a club smashed in\r\nhis skull. His son, the young Faru, fell into the hands of Fumba, who\r\nordered him bound as a future thanksgiving offering for the spirits who\r\nhad come to his assistance.\r\n\r\nStasch did not lead the terrible King into the battle, but only allowed\r\nhim to roar, which frightened the enemies much more. He did not shoot\r\nonce at the Samburus, for in the first place, before leaving Lunla he\r\npromised little Nell not to kill any one, and secondly, he had really no\r\ndesire to kill people who had never done him or Nell any harm. He was\r\nsatisfied in having secured the victory for the Wa-himas and in having\r\nreleased the besieged Fumba. When Kali came running up soon after with\r\nthe news of the final victory, he ordered him to stop the battle, which\r\nwas still raging in the clefts of the rocks and was being prolonged by\r\nFumba’s fury.\r\n\r\nBut it was daylight before Kali could accomplish this. As is usual in\r\ntropical countries, the sun rose quickly behind the mountains and\r\nflooded with its bright light the battlefield, where lay more than two\r\nhundred Samburu corpses. Some time later, when the fighting ceased and\r\nthe joyful howling of the Wa-himas disturbed the morning calm, Kali\r\nreappeared, but with such a sad and sorry countenance that it was very\r\nevident, even from a distance, that some mishap had befallen him.\r\nStanding still before Stasch, he began to pound his head with his fists\r\nand to cry out in a sad voice:\r\n\r\n“O Great Man! Fumba kufa! Fumba kufa!”[40]\r\n\r\n“Killed?” repeated Stasch questioningly.\r\n\r\nKali related what had happened, and from his words it was readily\r\nunderstood that this sad misfortune was the result of Fumba’s revenge,\r\nfor after the battle was over he attempted to kill two Samburus, and\r\nfrom one of them he received a thrust from a lance.\r\n\r\nThe news was soon dispersed among the Wa-himas, and an excited group\r\nsurrounded Kali. Soon afterward six warriors carried the old king on\r\nspears. He was not dead, but mortally wounded. He wanted to see, before\r\nhe died, the powerful man on an elephant who was the true conqueror of\r\nthe Samburus. Astonishment was in his eyes, but the haze of death was\r\nalso veiling them; and his pale and stiffening lips whispered softly:\r\n\r\n“Yancig! Yancig!”\r\n\r\nShortly after his head sank back, his mouth opened wide and he expired.\r\n\r\nKali, who loved him, threw himself on his breast and wept. Some of the\r\nwarriors began to beat their heads, others to proclaim Kali king and to\r\ncry out, “Yancig!” in his honor. Others fell on their faces before the\r\nyoung ruler. Not one dissenting voice was heard, for Kali was their king\r\nnot only because he was Fumba’s eldest son, but also because he had\r\ngained the victory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in the sorcerers’ huts and in the boma on the mountain-top the\r\nwild roaring of the bad Msimu could be heard. At first it was like the\r\nsound that Stasch had heard before in the negro village, but this time\r\nit was not directed against him, but demanded the death of the prisoners\r\nfor killing Fumba. The drums beat, the warriors formed in a long line,\r\neach row consisting of three men, and then began a war-dance around\r\nStasch, Kali, and the corpse of Fumba.\r\n\r\n“Oa! Oa! Yach! Yach!” repeated all the voices, their heads wagging right\r\nto left in a monotonous manner, the whites of their eyes shining, and\r\nthe points of their spears gleaming in the morning sun.\r\n\r\nKali stood up, turned to Stasch, and said:\r\n\r\n“The Great Man will bring Bibi to the boma and live in Fumba’s hut. Kali\r\nwill be king of the Wa-himas and the Great Man king over Kali.”\r\n\r\nStasch nodded his head as a sign of approval, but he remained there a\r\nfew hours longer, for he and King needed a rest.\r\n\r\nHe did not leave until toward evening. During his absence the corpses of\r\nthe Samburus were carried away and thrown into a deep ravine near by,\r\nover which a great many buzzards immediately settled. The sorcerers now\r\nmade preparation for Fumba’s burial, and Kali assumed the rulership as\r\nan absolute monarch, with power of life and death over all his subjects.\r\n\r\n“Do you know who Kali is?” Stasch asked the girl on the way back from\r\nLunla.\r\n\r\nNell looked at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n“He is your servant!”\r\n\r\n“Oho! A servant! Kali is now king of all the Wa-himas.”\r\n\r\nThis news amused Nell very much. This sudden change, by which the former\r\nslave of the treacherous Gebhr and later Stasch’s servant had become\r\nking, struck Nell as extraordinary and exceedingly droll.\r\n\r\nLinde’s remark that the negroes were like children, incapable of\r\nremembering what happened from one day to another, did not apply to\r\nKali, for scarcely had Stasch and Nell reached the foot of Boko Mountain\r\nthan the young monarch ran hastily toward them, greeted them with the\r\nusual reverence and joy, and repeated the same words he had spoken\r\nbefore:\r\n\r\n“Kali be king of the Wa-himas and the Great Man king over Kali.”\r\n\r\nHis admiration was so great that he all but worshiped Stasch; he made a\r\nvery low bow to Nell before the assembled people, for, from what he had\r\nobserved during the journey, he knew that the Great Man was more\r\nconcerned about the little Bibi than about himself.\r\n\r\nAfter he had solemnly led Stasch and Nell up to the summit where the\r\nboma was, he assigned Fumba’s hut to them; it resembled a large shed\r\ndivided into several rooms. He ordered the Wa-hima women, who\r\naccompanied them from Lunla, and who never tired of gazing at the good\r\nMsimu, to put vessels of honey and sour milk in the first room, and when\r\nhe heard that the Bibi, who was very much fatigued from the journey, had\r\nfallen asleep, he commanded all the people to keep perfectly quiet,\r\nunder penalty of having their tongues cut out. He now decided to pay\r\nthem still greater homage, and so when Stasch appeared before the shed\r\nafter a short rest, Kali approached, bowed low before him, and said:\r\n\r\n“To-morrow Kali will give orders to bury Fumba and to behead as many\r\nslaves for Fumba and Kali as there are fingers on both their hands; and\r\nto propitiate Bibi and the Great Man Kali will order Faru, the son of\r\nMamba, to be beheaded, and also wengi, wengi other Samburus taken\r\nprisoners by the Wa-himas.”\r\n\r\nStasch frowned, and gazing severely into Kali’s eyes, replied:\r\n\r\n“I forbid it.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the young negro in a trembling voice, “the Wa-himas always\r\nbehead their prisoners. When the old king dies they behead people; if a\r\nyoung king follows they behead people. If Kali does not command them to\r\nbe killed the Wa-himas will not believe that Kali is king!”\r\n\r\nStasch looked at him still more severely:\r\n\r\n“Well, how’s that?” said he. “And did you not learn anything on Linde\r\nMountain? Are you not a Christian?”\r\n\r\n“I am, O Great Man!”\r\n\r\n“Then listen! The Wa-himas have black brains, but your brains must be\r\nwhite. As you are now their king, you must enlighten and teach them what\r\nyou learned from me and Bibi. They are now like jackals and hyenas—make\r\nhuman beings of them. Tell them that it is forbidden to behead prisoners\r\nof war, for the Great Spirit to whom Bibi and I pray punishes those who\r\nshed innocent blood. White people do not behead prisoners, and you would\r\ntreat them even more cruelly than Gebhr did you—and you a Christian!\r\nShame on you, Kali! Replace the ancient and savage customs of the\r\nWa-himas by humane ones and God will bless you, and Bibi will not say\r\nthat Kali is a savage, a stupid and vicious negro.”\r\n\r\nA terrible roaring from the sorcerers’ huts drowned his words. Stasch\r\nwaved his hand excitedly and continued: “I hear! Your Msimu wants the\r\nblood and the heads of the prisoners. But you know quite well what this\r\nis, and so you are not frightened at this noise. Therefore I only say\r\nthis much to you: Take a bamboo rod, go into every hut and thrash the\r\nsorcerers until they roar louder than their kettle-drums, and throw the\r\nkettle-drums into the midst of the boma, so that all the Wa-himas may\r\nsee and comprehend how these villains are deceiving them; and at the\r\nsame time tell your stupid Wa-himas what you told M’Rua’s people—that\r\nwhere the good Msimu dwells the blood of human beings must not be shed.”\r\n\r\nStasch’s words apparently had some weight with the young king, for he\r\nlooked at him a moment and answered:\r\n\r\n“Kali will thrash the sorcerers well, will throw out the kettle-drums,\r\nand tell the Wa-himas that where the good Msimu is no blood must be\r\nshed. But what shall Kali do with Faru and the Samburus who have killed\r\nFumba?”\r\n\r\nStasch, who had already planned everything, had anticipated this\r\nquestion, immediately answered:\r\n\r\n“Your father was slain, his father was slain, so both were slain. You\r\nmust form a brotherhood with young Faru, then the Wa-himas and the\r\nSamburus will live together in peace, planting manioc and hunting\r\ntogether. You must tell Faru about the Great Spirit, and Faru will love\r\nyou like a brother.”\r\n\r\n“Kali now have white brains!” answered the young negro.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the conversation ended. Soon afterward savage roars resounded\r\nonce more, but this time not from the wicked Msimu, but from the two\r\nsorcerers, whose skin Kali was thrashing as hard as he could. The\r\nwarriors, who had remained below standing in a circle around King,\r\nhurried up the hill to see what was the matter; they saw with their own\r\neyes and heard from the words of the sorcerers themselves that the\r\nwicked Msimu, before whom they were accustomed to tremble, was only a\r\nhollowed-out tree trunk covered with monkey-skin. And when they told\r\nyoung Faru that in deference to the wishes of the good Msimu and the\r\nGreat Man he was not to be beheaded, but that Kali would eat a piece of\r\nhim and he a piece of Kali, he could not trust his senses; then on\r\nhearing to whom he owed his life, he pushed himself before the entrance\r\nto Fumba’s hut and lay there until Nell came out and bade him arise.\r\nThen he took hold of her little foot with his black hands and placed it\r\non his head, as a sign that he would remain her slave for the rest of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nThe Wa-himas were very much surprised at such orders of the young king,\r\nbut the presence of the unknown guests, whom they looked upon as the\r\nmost powerful sorcerers in the world, awed them to silence. The older\r\npeople were displeased with the new customs, and the two sorcerers,\r\nrealizing that all their good times were over, swore in their hearts to\r\ntake terrible vengeance on the king and the newcomers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fumba was solemnly buried at the foot of the mountain under\r\nthe boma. Kali planted a bamboo cross on his grave, and the negroes\r\nplaced on it several vessels containing pombe and smoked meat, so that\r\nhis spirit would not disturb them during the night.\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony of the brotherhood between Kali and Faru was over,\r\nMamba’s corpse was given to the Samburus.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\nAn intoxicating beer made from millet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\nLances and spears.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\nFumba is dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n“Well, can you tell how many journeys we have made since we left\r\nFayoum?” asked Stasch.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThe girl raised her eyebrows and began to count on her fingers.\r\n\r\n“Let me see: From Fayoum to Khartum—the first journey; from Khartum to\r\nFashoda—the second; from Fashoda to the gorge, where we found King—the\r\nthird; from Linde Mountain to the lake—the fourth!”\r\n\r\n“Right. Perhaps there is not another fly in the world who has flown\r\nthrough so much of Africa.”\r\n\r\n“This fly would have been in a nice plight without you.”\r\n\r\nAnd he began to laugh.\r\n\r\n“A fly on an elephant! A fly on an elephant!”\r\n\r\n“But no tsetse. Ah, Stasch, no tsetse?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied; “a more agreeable kind of fly.”\r\n\r\nNell, satisfied with this praise, leaned her little face on his arm and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n“And when shall we start on our fifth journey?”\r\n\r\n“As soon as you are rested and I have taught these people, whom Kali has\r\npromised to send along with us, how to shoot a little.”\r\n\r\n“And are we going to travel very long?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, long, Nell, long! Who knows if this won’t be the longest road?”\r\n\r\n“And you will, as you always do, find a way out of all our\r\ndifficulties?”\r\n\r\n“I _must_.”\r\n\r\nStasch really did the best he could, but the fifth journey required\r\ngreat preparation. They were going once more into unknown districts, in\r\nwhich there lurked innumerable dangers, and against these the boy wished\r\nto take greater precautions than he had ever done before. For this\r\nreason he taught forty young Wa-himas to shoot with Remington rifles,\r\nfor he thought they would form a picked troop and would also serve as a\r\nguard for Nell. He could not train more men to shoot, for King had only\r\ncarried twenty-five rifles and the horses had carried fifteen. The rest\r\nof the army was to be made up of a hundred Wa-himas and a hundred\r\nSamburus armed with lances and bows, which Faru promised to supply, and\r\nwhose presence solved the difficulties of the journey through the long\r\nstretch of wild country inhabited by the Samburu tribes. Stasch\r\nrecollected with pride how he had fled from Fashoda, traveling with no\r\none but Nell and two negroes, and that he had had no help of any kind;\r\nso he now thought that, being in command of two hundred armed men, and\r\nhaving an elephant and some horses, he could soon reach the coast. He\r\ntried to imagine what Englishmen, who lay such stress on forming\r\nresolutions, would say to this, and especially what his father and Mr.\r\nRawlison would say, and this made every difficulty appear light.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he was very uneasy for Nell’s safety and for his own. Sure\r\nenough, he would most likely have little difficulty in passing through\r\nthe Wa-hima and Samburu territory, but what would follow? What kind of\r\ntribes would he be likely to meet, through what countries and how many\r\nmiles would he have to travel? Linde’s directions had not been specific\r\nenough. Stasch was very much worried because he had no idea where he\r\nwas, for this part of Africa was represented as a white spot on the maps\r\nwhich he had studied. Besides, he had not the least idea what the\r\nBasso-Narok Lake really was like or how large it was. He happened to be\r\non its south bank, where it appeared to be some ten kilometers wide. But\r\nhow far the lake stretched toward the north was something that neither\r\nthe Wa-himas nor the Samburus could tell him. Kali, who knew the\r\nKi-swahili language fairly well, answered all questions with “bali,\r\nbali,” which meant “far, far,” and that was all that Stasch could get\r\nhim to say.\r\n\r\nAs in the north, the mountains at the horizon appeared to be fairly\r\nnear, and he supposed that this water was a small salt lake, many of\r\nwhich are to be found in Africa. Several years later it was evident that\r\nhe had been mistaken.[41] For the present it was not absolutely\r\nnecessary to be more familiar with the banks of the Basso-Narok, but it\r\nwas important to find out whether a river flowed from it, eventually\r\nemptying itself into the ocean. The Samburus, Faru’s subjects, declared\r\nthat to the east of their country lay a large, waterless desert, which\r\nno one had ever crossed. Stasch knew the negroes well from the stories\r\nof travelers and from Linde’s adventures, as well as from his own\r\nexperiences with them, and he was convinced that as soon as danger and\r\nweariness would overtake them many would return home, and perhaps not a\r\nsingle one remain with him. In this case he would find himself in the\r\nmiddle of the desert alone with Nell, Mea, and the little Nasibu. But,\r\nabove all, he recognized that the lack of water would break up and\r\ndisperse the caravan. Following the water-course, it would be impossible\r\nto suffer the tortures which attack all travelers in arid regions, so he\r\ninquired where a stream could be found.\r\n\r\nBut the Samburus were unable to give him any reliable information, and\r\nhe could not take a lengthy excursion along the eastern bank of the lake\r\nbecause other duties retained him at the boma. He was of the opinion\r\nthat of all the kites he had sent up from Linde Mountain and from the\r\nnegro villages through which they had passed, probably not one had flown\r\nover the chain of mountains surrounding the Basso-Narok. For this reason\r\nit was necessary to make new ones and send them up, for these were the\r\nonly ones the wind could carry far off over the flat desert, perhaps to\r\nthe ocean. He had to give his personal attention to this matter, for\r\nNell was very skilful in making the kites and Kali had learned how to\r\nsend them up, but neither was able to write on them the necessary\r\nmessage. Stasch believed this to be a matter of the greatest importance,\r\nwhich should on no account be neglected.\r\n\r\nThese duties occupied so much time that the caravan was not ready to\r\nstart for three weeks. On the evening before they intended to depart the\r\nyoung king of the Wa-himas appeared before Stasch, made a low bow, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Kali will go with the master and with Bibi as far as the sheet of water\r\non which the large rafts of the white men swim.”\r\n\r\nThis proof of devotion touched Stasch, but he did not feel he had the\r\nright to take the boy on such an extended journey, from which he might\r\nnot be able to return in safety.\r\n\r\n“Why do you want to go with us?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Kali loves the Great Man and Bibi.”\r\n\r\nStasch laid his hand on the woolly head.\r\n\r\n“Kali, I know that you are a true and faithful boy. But what will happen\r\nto your kingdom, and who will reign over the Wa-himas in your place?”\r\n\r\n“M’Lana, a brother of Kali’s mother.”\r\n\r\nStasch knew that negroes fight for the throne, that power attracts them\r\njust as it does white people; he thought a while and then said:\r\n\r\n“No, Kali! I can not take you along. You must stay with the Wa-himas in\r\norder to make good people of them.”\r\n\r\n“Kali return to them.”\r\n\r\n“M’Lana has many sons, and what would happen if he should aspire to be\r\nking himself and to leave his kingdom to his sons, and therefore\r\ninstigate the Wa-himas against you, so that they drive you away when you\r\nseek to return?”\r\n\r\n“M’Lana is good. He no do that!”\r\n\r\n“But if he does do it?”\r\n\r\n“Then Kali will go to the great sheet of water, to the Great Man and\r\nBibi.”\r\n\r\n“We shall not be there then.”\r\n\r\n“Then Kali will sit down near the water and weep for sorrow.”\r\n\r\nAt these words he folded his hands over his head and whispered:\r\n\r\n“Kali loves the Great Man and Bibi—very much!” And two large tears\r\nshone in his eyes.\r\n\r\nStasch hesitated, not knowing what to do. He felt sorry for Kali, but he\r\ndid not grant his request at once. He knew that—apart from the dangers\r\nhe might encounter on the return journey—if M’Lana or the sorcerers\r\nwere to incite the negroes, not only would the young negro be banished\r\nfrom his country, but his life would be endangered.\r\n\r\n“It will be much better for you to stay here,” he said; “much better!”\r\n\r\nBut while he was speaking Nell appeared; she had overheard the whole\r\nconversation through the thin partition which separated the caravan, and\r\nwhen she saw tears in Kali’s eyes she wiped them away with her little\r\nfingers, and turning to Stasch, said:\r\n\r\n“Kali will go with us!” This she spoke in a decided tone.\r\n\r\n“Oho!” answered Stasch, a little hurt. “You are not the one to decide.”\r\n\r\n“Kali will go with us!” she repeated.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not!”\r\n\r\nThen she suddenly stamped her little foot, saying:\r\n\r\n“I wish it!” And burst into tears.\r\n\r\nStasch looked at her in great surprise, as if unable to understand what\r\nhad happened to the child, who was usually so good and so gentle, but\r\nwhen he saw how she put both little fists up to her eyes and with open\r\nmouth gasped for air like a little bird, he at once said:\r\n\r\n“Kali shall go with us—yes, he shall go with us! Why are you crying?\r\nHow unreasonable you are! He shall go! Do you hear? He shall go!”\r\n\r\nAnd so it was settled. Stasch felt ashamed of himself all that day\r\nbecause of his weakness in giving in to the “good Msimu,” and she,\r\nhaving gained her point, was as quiet, gentle, and submissive as ever.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\nThis was the large lake discovered by the famous explorer Teleki in\r\n1888, and named Rudolf Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nThe caravan started on its journey at sunrise the following day. The\r\nyoung negro felt very happy, the little despot was gentle and obedient,\r\nand Stasch was full of energy and hope. A hundred Wa-himas accompanied\r\nthem, forty of the latter being armed with Remington rifles, which they\r\nknew how to use quite well. Their white leader, who had instructed them\r\nfor three weeks, knew that at a given signal they would make a great\r\ndeal of noise, but do little damage; he also knew that in a conflict\r\nwith savage people noise plays as important a part as do bullets, and he\r\nwas pleased with his guards. The caravan took away large quantities of\r\nmanioc, little baked cakes made of big fat ants carefully dried and\r\nground to flour, and also a great deal of smoked meat. About ten women\r\nalso accompanied the caravan, and they carried various things for Nell’s\r\ncomfort and water-bags made of antelope skins. From the elephant’s back\r\nStasch supervised and gave orders, which were perhaps not exactly\r\nnecessary, but he did this more because he loved to play the rôle of the\r\nleader of an army; indeed, he surveyed his small army with pride.\r\n\r\n“If I wanted to,” he said to himself, “I could be king of all these\r\ntribes—just as Benjowski was in Madagascar!”\r\n\r\nAnd the thought flashed through his brain that perhaps it would be well\r\nto return here eventually, subjugate a whole region, civilize the\r\nnegroes, and found a new Poland in this country, or even to leave for\r\nold Poland at the head of an army of trained negro soldiers; but feeling\r\nthis was an absurd idea, and doubting whether his father would give him\r\npermission to play the part of an Alexander of Macedon in Africa, he did\r\nnot confide these thoughts to Nell, who was the only person in the world\r\nwho would agree with him.\r\n\r\nBesides, it would be essential to be independent of these savages before\r\nattempting to conquer this part of Africa, and so he busied himself with\r\nwhat lay nearest him. The caravan advanced in a rope-like line. Stasch,\r\non King, had determined to bring up the rear, so as to be able to have\r\neverything under his own eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the people marched past him in single file he noticed with surprise\r\nthat the two sorcerers, M’Kunji and M’Pua, who had been thrashed by\r\nKali, also belonged to the caravan, and were carrying baggage on their\r\nheads and marching along with the others.\r\n\r\nHe stopped them and asked:\r\n\r\n“Who told you you might go along with us?”\r\n\r\n“The king,” answered both, bowing very low.\r\n\r\nBut under the mask of humility their eyes shone so wildly and their\r\nfaces bore such an expression of rage that at first Stasch felt like\r\ndriving them away, and was only prevented because he did not wish to\r\nundermine Kali’s authority.\r\n\r\nCalling Kali to him, he asked:\r\n\r\n“Did you order the sorcerers to go with us?”\r\n\r\n“Kali told them to, for Kali is clever.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore I again ask you, why did your cleverness not leave them at\r\nhome?”\r\n\r\n“If M’Kunji and M’Pua had remained, they would have stirred up the\r\nWa-himas so that they would have killed Kali on his return, and if they\r\ngo along with us Kali will look out for them and put a guard on them.”\r\n\r\nStasch considered a while and said:\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right; but be on the alert day and night, for there is\r\nmischief in their eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Kali has bamboos,” answered the young negro.\r\n\r\nThe caravan now set forth. At the last moment Stasch ordered that the\r\nguards equipped with Remington rifles should close the procession, for\r\nthey were selected and trusted men. During the gun practising they had\r\nin a way become fond of their young leader, and because they guarded his\r\nillustrious person they felt themselves more favored than the others.\r\nThey now had to guard the entire caravan and to capture those who\r\nattempted to run away. It was evident that as soon as danger or fatigue\r\ncame there would be plenty of deserters.\r\n\r\nOn the first day, however, everything was peaceful as could be. The\r\nnegroes with the burdens on their heads, each armed with a spear and\r\nseveral smaller darts, wound through the jungle in one long line. For a\r\nwhile they advanced over a flat tract on the southern border of the\r\nlake, but as high mountain summits enclosed the lake on all sides, they\r\nfound on turning toward the east that it was necessary to climb over the\r\nhills. The old Samburus, who knew this country, declared that the\r\ncaravan would have to cross narrow passes which lay between the\r\nmountains Kulall and Imo, and that until they reached the other side\r\nthey would not come to the flat land south of Bovani. Stasch knew that\r\nthey could not march directly eastward, for he remembered that Mombasa\r\nlay several degrees the other side of the equator, and therefore a\r\nconsiderable distance south of this unknown lake. But as he still\r\npossessed several of Linde’s compasses he was not afraid of losing his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe quarters for the first night were arranged on a woody height.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it had become dark a great many campfires flashed forth,\r\naround which the negroes roasted dried meat and ate cakes made of manioc\r\nroots, which they took out of the pots with their fingers. After they\r\nhad appeased their hunger and thirst they talked over matters with one\r\nanother, speculating as to where “Bwana Kubwa” was going to lead them,\r\nand what they would receive for their services. Some sang as they\r\nsquatted on the ground like Turks and stared into the fire, but they all\r\ntalked so long and so loudly that at last Stasch was obliged to command\r\nsilence so that Nell could sleep.\r\n\r\nThe night was very cool, but the next morning when the first rays of\r\nsunlight lighted up the scene the air became warm. At sunrise the small\r\ntravelers beheld a peculiar sight. They were just approaching a lake\r\nabout two hundred kilometers long, or what might be called a large\r\npuddle, which had been formed in a mountain valley by the rain, when\r\nStasch, who was sitting alongside of the girl on King and surveying his\r\nsurroundings through the telescope, suddenly cried:\r\n\r\n“Nell, look! See the elephants going to the water!”\r\n\r\nHalf a kilometer away could be seen a herd of five beasts slowly\r\nadvancing single file toward the small lake.\r\n\r\n“But these are strange looking elephants,” said Stasch, who was still\r\nregarding them very attentively. “They are not so large as King, and\r\nhave much smaller ears, and as for tusks, I don’t see any at all.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the elephants went into the water, but they did not pause on\r\nthe bank like King usually did, and did not bathe themselves with their\r\ntrunks, but steadily advancing, they went deeper and deeper into the\r\nwater, so that at last only their black backs, resembling pieces of\r\nrock, stood out over the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n“What’s that? They are diving!” cried Stasch.\r\n\r\nThe caravan was slowly approaching the bank, and at last reached it.\r\nStasch ordered a halt, and gazed with the greatest surprise, first at\r\nNell, then at the lake. There was nothing to be seen of the elephants\r\nexcept five dots looking like red flowers riding above the surface of\r\nthe water and rocking gently to and fro.\r\n\r\n“They are standing on the bottom, and these are the ends of their\r\ntrunks,” exclaimed Stasch, scarcely believing his own eyes. Then he\r\ncalled to Kali:\r\n\r\n“Kali, did you see?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, Kali has seen; those are water-elephants,”[42] answered the\r\nyoung negro calmly.\r\n\r\n“Water-elephants?”\r\n\r\n“This is not the first time Kali has seen them!”\r\n\r\n“And they live in the water?”\r\n\r\n“In the night they go into the jungle and graze; in the daytime they\r\nlive in the lake, just like the riboks.[43] They do not go out until\r\nafter sunset.”\r\n\r\nFor some time Stasch could not recover from his surprise, and had he not\r\nbeen in a hurry to continue the journey he would have held back the\r\ncaravan till the evening, so as to have a better opportunity of\r\nobserving these peculiar beasts. But it also occurred to him that the\r\nelephants might emerge on the opposite side of the lake, and even if\r\nthey were to come out of the water at any nearer place, it would be\r\ndifficult to see them well in the dark.\r\n\r\nSo he gave the command to depart, but on the way he said to Nell:\r\n\r\n“Nell, we have seen something which no European has ever seen before.\r\nAnd do you know what I think? That if we are lucky enough to reach the\r\nocean no one will believe me when I tell them that there are\r\nwater-elephants in Africa.”\r\n\r\n“And if you had caught one of them and had taken it along with you to\r\nthe ocean?” said Nell, who, as usual, felt satisfied that Stasch could\r\ndo anything.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\nIn Africa there are many unraveled mysteries. Tales of water-elephants\r\nhad repeatedly reached the ears of explorers, but no one credited them.\r\nLately the Paris Museum of Natural History commissioned Monsieur Le\r\nPetit, who had seen water-elephants on the shores of Lake Leopold in the\r\nCongo, to write on the subject. This report can be seen in the German\r\nMagazine “Kosmos.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\nHippopotamus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nAfter traveling ten days the caravan issued from the mountain pass and\r\nentered a very different region, an extended plain, mostly level, but\r\nbroken here and there by small, wave-like hillocks. The vegetation was\r\ncompletely changed. No large trees towered above the waving, grassy\r\nplain. Only here and there, quite far apart, there sprang up\r\nrubber-acacias, with coral-colored and umbrella-shaped stems, but scanty\r\nfoliage, and therefore furnishing but little shade. In some places\r\nbetween the ant-hills a species of euphorbia, with branches resembling\r\nthe arms of a candlestick, grew taller than the grass. Hawks soared high\r\nin the air, and lower down black and white feathered crow-like birds\r\nflew from one acacia bush to the other. The grass was yellow and had\r\nears like ripe corn. The dried-up jungle seemed to furnish abundant food\r\nfor many different kinds of animals, for during the day the travelers\r\noften met large herds of antelope and a great many zebras. The heat on\r\nthe open and treeless plain became unbearable. The sky was cloudless,\r\nthe days were fiery hot, and the night did not bring much relief.\r\n\r\nDay by day the journey grew more arduous. The small villages through\r\nwhich the caravan passed were inhabited by the wildest savages, who were\r\nso terror-stricken that they received the travelers very reluctantly,\r\nand if it had not been for the numerous armed men and the sight of white\r\nfaces, and King and Saba, great danger would have threatened them.\r\n\r\nStasch, aided by Kali, learned that there were no more villages farther\r\non, and that they were coming to a waterless district. The tales they\r\nheard were hard to believe, for the numerous animals they saw must have\r\nfound some watering-place. But these stories of a desert in which there\r\nwas rumored to be neither stream nor puddle frightened the negroes, and\r\nsome of them deserted the party, and M’Kunji and M’Pua set the example.\r\nFortunately, their flight was quickly perceived, and the mounted troupe\r\nwhich accompanied the travelers discovered them before they had gotten\r\nfar from the camp. When they were brought back Kali, by the aid of a\r\nbamboo rod, convinced them of the inadvisability of such a course.\r\nStasch assembled the whole company and gave them a lecture, which the\r\nyoung negro translated into their native language. Dwelling on the fact\r\nthat at their last headquarters they had heard lions roaring around the\r\ncamp all night, Stasch did his best to convince his people that any one\r\nattempting to run away would certainly become their prey, or if he were\r\nto pass the night in an acacia tree the still more terrible wobos would\r\nlie in wait for him. He also said that where there are antelope there\r\nmust also be water, and that if in the course of their journey they were\r\nto strike waterless regions, they could take with them enough water for\r\ntwo or three days in bags of antelope skin. The negroes paid strict\r\nattention to what he said, and continually repeated:\r\n\r\n“Oh, mother, how true it is!” but the following night five Samburus and\r\ntwo Wa-himas deserted, and from that time some one was missing every\r\nnight. But M’Kunji and M’Pua did not make a second attempt to escape for\r\nthe simple reason that Kali had them bound at sundown every night.\r\n\r\nThe country became drier and drier, the sun beat down mercilessly on the\r\njungle, and not a single acacia could now be seen. They still came\r\nacross herds of antelope, though fewer than they had seen previously.\r\nThe donkey and the horses so far had enough food, for beneath the high\r\ndried grass they found in many places short, green grass only slightly\r\nscorched by the sun. But King, although he was not fastidious, became\r\nmuch thinner. On approaching an acacia he would break it apart with his\r\nhead and trunk and fill himself with young leaves and pods. Until now\r\nthe caravan had always been able to strike water, though it was often\r\nbad and had to be filtered, or so salty that it was not fit to drink.\r\nThen it often happened that the men Stasch sent out in advance under\r\nKali’s guidance would return without having found a single puddle or\r\neven a tiny brook in the hollows of the ground, and Kali would proclaim\r\nin troubled tones, “Madi apana”—“There is no water there.”\r\n\r\nStasch was soon convinced that this long, final journey would certainly\r\nnot be easier than the ones they had accomplished before, and he began\r\nto worry about Nell, for a great change had also come over her. Her\r\nface, instead of being tanned by the sun and wind, had become paler and\r\npaler day by day and her eyes had lost their accustomed brilliancy.\r\nFortunately, on these dry plains there were no flies nor danger of\r\nfever, but it was very evident that the unbearable heat was wasting away\r\nthe girl’s strength. Even now the boy looked sadly and apprehensively at\r\nher little hands, which had become as white as paper, and he bitterly\r\nreproached himself for having lost so much time in making preparations\r\nand in instructing the negroes how to shoot that he had to continue the\r\njourney in the hottest time of the year.\r\n\r\nWith these anxieties the days passed. Even more greedily and mercilessly\r\nthe sun drank the dampness and the life from the earth. The grass\r\nshriveled and dried up until it was so brittle that it broke off under\r\nthe hoofs of the antelope, which threw up clouds of dust as they passed.\r\nBut the travelers now found a small stream, which they distinguished\r\nfrom a distance by the long rows of trees growing on its banks. The\r\nnegroes ran as fast as they could toward the trees, and on arriving at\r\nthe bank threw themselves down side by side on the ground, dipping their\r\nheads in the water and drinking so greedily that they only desisted when\r\na crocodile caught one of them by the hand. Other negroes immediately\r\nhastened to the assistance of their comrade and drew the horrible\r\nreptile out of the water at once, but it would not let go of the man’s\r\nhand, although they opened its jaws with spears and knives. King,\r\nhowever, made an end of it by trampling it under foot, as if it had been\r\na rotten mushroom. When the negroes had at last quenched their thirst,\r\nStasch ordered a round fence of tall bamboos to be erected in the\r\nshallow water, so it could only be entered from one side of the bank,\r\nthat Nell might bathe in privacy. The girl was greatly refreshed by the\r\nbath, after which she lay down, and after a rest felt greatly\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nTo the great delight of the whole caravan, including Nell, Bwana Kubwa\r\ndecided to remain ten days near the water. When this became known all\r\nfelt so happy that they forgot the fatigue they had experienced; some,\r\nafter being restored by a good nap, wandered among the trees near the\r\nstream looking for palms that bear wild dates,[44] called Job’s\r\ntears,[45] of which necklaces are made. Some of them returned before\r\nsunset carrying in their hands square, white objects, which Stasch\r\nrecognized as his own kites.\r\n\r\nOne of these kites bore the number seven, which proved that it had been\r\nsent up from Linde Mountain, for the children had sent up at least ten\r\nfrom that place. The sight of this pleased Stasch so much that he took\r\nheart again.\r\n\r\n“I had no idea,” he said to Nell, “that the kites could fly so far. I\r\nwas sure that they would be entangled in the peaks of the Karamajo\r\nMountains, and I only sent them up thinking to let them take their\r\nchance. But now I see that the wind can carry them in any direction, and\r\nI trust those we sent up from the mountains around the Basso-Narok and\r\non the road here will fly as far as the ocean.”\r\n\r\n“They will certainly fly there,” said Nell.\r\n\r\n“So be it!” said the boy to strengthen his trust, while thinking of the\r\ndangers and difficulties that still lay before them on their journey.\r\n\r\nThe third day the caravan started off again, taking with them a large\r\nsupply of water in the leather bags. Before nightfall they again came to\r\na region dried up by the rays of the sun. Not even an acacia was to be\r\nseen, and the ground in some places resembled a threshing-floor.\r\nOccasionally they came across passiflora with stems penetrating the\r\nground and resembling huge bottle-gourds,[46] as much as four feet or\r\nmore in diameter. From these enormous balls grew lianas, thin as twine,\r\nwhich crept along the ground quite a distance, forming such an\r\nimpenetrable thicket that even mice would have had a hard time to find a\r\nway through it. But notwithstanding the beautiful green of these plants,\r\nwhich remind one of the European bear’s-foot, they were so very thorny\r\nthat neither King nor the horses could eat any part of them. The donkey,\r\nhowever, nibbled at them, though very carefully.\r\n\r\nAt times they saw nothing for several miles except coarse short grass\r\nand flowers of a low order, like the Dürrblumen,[47] which breaks off at\r\nthe merest touch. On their first day in this place the sun beat down in\r\nfiery heat all day long. The air quivered as it does in the Libyan\r\ndesert. The earth was so flooded with light that all objects appeared\r\nwhite. Not a sound, not even the buzzing of insects, broke the deathlike\r\nstillness, through which penetrated the wilting glare.\r\n\r\nAll in the party were bathed in perspiration. Now and again they would\r\nlay down the baggage, the dried meat, and the shields in a large pile,\r\nso as to find shade beneath it. Stasch gave orders to be sparing of the\r\nwater; but negroes are like children, who take no thought for the\r\nmorrow. At last it became necessary to place a guard around those who\r\ncarried the bags of provisions, and to deal out a fixed allowance of\r\nwater to each one separately. Kali fulfilled this task very\r\nconscientiously, but it consumed a great deal of time, retarded their\r\nmarch, and therefore the finding of new watering-places. The Samburus\r\nnow complained that the Wa-himas were given more water than they, and\r\nthe Wa-himas complained that the preference was shown to the Samburus.\r\nThe latter now threatened to turn back, but Stasch gave them to\r\nunderstand that if they did Faru would have them beheaded, and he\r\nhimself ordered the hunters, who were armed with Remington rifles, to\r\nkeep guard and see that no one escaped.\r\n\r\nThe second night they passed on a barren plain. No boma, or, as they\r\ncalled it in the Sudanese language, zareba, was erected, for there was\r\nnothing there to build it of.\r\n\r\nKing and Saba formed the camp guards, which in reality was sufficient\r\nprotection; but King, who had not been given a tenth of the water he\r\nneeded, trumpeted for it until sunrise, and Saba hung out his tongue,\r\nturned his eyes toward Stasch and Nell, silently begging for at least a\r\nfew drops of water to drink. The girl asked Stasch to give the dog a\r\nlittle drink of water out of one of the rubber bags which they had found\r\namong Linde’s things, and which he wore attached to a cord around his\r\nneck, but he was keeping this for the little girl, in case of dire\r\nnecessity, and refused her request.\r\n\r\nToward evening of the fourth day there were only five small bags of\r\nwater left, containing hardly enough to give each person half a\r\nglassful. But as the nights were always cooler than the days, one is not\r\nso thirsty then as under the burning rays of the sun, and as every one\r\nhad been given a little water to drink in the morning, Stasch ordered\r\nthat the water-bags be reserved for the following day. The negroes\r\ngrumbled at this, but they still stood in such awe of Stasch that they\r\ndid not dare to tamper with the little that was left, especially as\r\nthere were always two men armed with Remington rifles keeping guard over\r\nthe water-bags, who relieved each other every hour. The Wa-himas and the\r\nSamburus quenched their thirst as best they could by pulling up\r\nmiserable blades of grass and chewing their small roots, but even these\r\nhad retained no moisture, for the merciless sun had sucked it all out of\r\nthe ground.[48]\r\n\r\nAlthough sleep did not quench their thirst, it at least enabled them to\r\nforget it. At night every one of the party, tired and exhausted from the\r\nday’s march, dropped down where he stood, apparently lifeless, and fell\r\nfast asleep. Stasch also slept, but he was too much worried and troubled\r\nto sleep long and restfully. After a few hours he awoke and began to\r\nwonder what the future would bring forth and where he could find water\r\nfor Nell and the whole caravan, man and beast. The situation was\r\ndifficult and even terrible, but as yet the sensible boy did not yield\r\nto despair. He recalled all that had happened since they had been\r\ncarried off from Fayoum until the present moment—the first great\r\njourney through the Sahara, the hurricane in the desert, the escape from\r\nGebhr, then the journey which they took after Linde’s death to Lake\r\nBasso-Narok and on to where they were now stopping. “We have gone\r\nthrough so much, and suffered so much,” he said to himself. “How often\r\nit seemed to me that everything had collapsed and I could find no way\r\nout of my difficulties; yet God helped me, and I always found a way out.\r\nIt is quite impossible that after having gone so far and been through so\r\nmany dangers we should give out on this last journey. We still have a\r\nlittle water, and this place is certainly not the Sahara, for if it were\r\nthe people would surely have known it!”\r\n\r\nBut he was especially elated by the fact that during the day he had seen\r\nthrough the telescope indistinct outlines, as of mountains, lying toward\r\nthe south. To reach them would mean a journey of perhaps a hundred\r\nmiles; but if they only could reach them they would be saved, for\r\nmountains are rarely without water. How much time that would require he\r\nwas unable to tell, for it depended on the height of the mountain. In\r\nair so transparent as in Africa high summits can be seen a considerable\r\ndistance away, so water must be found nearer by. Otherwise destruction\r\nthreatened them.\r\n\r\n“It _must_ be done!” Stasch repeated to himself.\r\n\r\nThe hard breathing of the elephant, who was trying his best to blow the\r\nfiery heat out of his lungs, continually interrupted the thoughts of the\r\nboy. But after a while it seemed to him as if he heard a voice like some\r\none groaning, which sounded as though it came from another part of the\r\ncamp; in fact, from where the water-bags lay covered up for the night\r\nwith grass. As the groaning continued, he arose and went to see what was\r\nthe matter. The night was so bright that in the distance he could see\r\ntwo dark bodies lying side by side and the barrels of the guns\r\nglistening in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n“The negroes are all alike!” he thought. “They should be guarding this\r\nwater, which is now more precious to us than anything else in the world,\r\nand both of them are sleeping as soundly as if in their own huts. Ah!\r\nKali’s bamboo will be of some use to-morrow!”\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts he approached nearer and kicked one of the guards,\r\nbut immediately drew back horrified—for the apparently sleeping negro\r\nlay on his back with a knife thrust up to the hilt in his throat, and\r\nbeside him lay the other man with his throat so terribly cut that his\r\nhead was nearly severed from his body.\r\n\r\nTwo bags of water had disappeared—three lay in the middle of the\r\nuprooted grass slit open and shriveled.\r\n\r\nStasch’s hair stood on end.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\nPhœnix Senegalensis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\nCoix Lacrymax-Jobi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\nAdenia globosa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\nPlants peculiarly adapted to dry climates.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\nFor further information regarding the arid plains in these regions see\r\nthe excellent book, “Kili Mandjaro,” by Father Le Roy, now Bishop of\r\nGabun.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nAt his cries Kali came running up, and after him the two men who were to\r\nrelieve the guards, and then all the Wa-himas and Samburus assembled,\r\nhowling and roaring around the place where the crime had been committed.\r\nThe greatest noise and confusion ensued, the underlying keynote being\r\none of fear. The negroes were not so much disturbed on account of the\r\nmen having been murdered and a crime committed as they were at having\r\nlost their last drop of water, now absorbed by the parched earth of the\r\njungle. Several threw themselves on the ground and pulled up lumps of\r\nearth with their fingers and sucked out the remaining moisture. Others\r\ncried that wicked spirits had killed the guards and slit the bags. But\r\nStasch and Kali knew how much credit to give to these tales. M’Kunji and\r\nM’Pua were missing from the howling throng. More than the murder of two\r\nguards and the theft of water had taken place. The water-bags left\r\nbehind, having been torn, proved that it was done for revenge; it meant\r\ndeath for the whole caravan. The priests of the wicked Msimu had taken\r\nrevenge on the good Msimu. The sorcerers had taken revenge on the young\r\nking because he had brought their deceptions to light and had not\r\npermitted them to continue deceiving the stupid Wa-himas. But now death\r\nhovered over the caravan like a hawk over a flock of doves.\r\n\r\nKali remembered, when it was too late, that he had been so sad and also\r\nso busy that he had forgotten to have the sorcerers bound, as he had\r\ndone every evening since their attempt to escape. It was also evident\r\nthat the two negroes guarding the water had lain down and gone to sleep,\r\nwith the inherent thoughtlessness of their race. This had made the work\r\nof the villains easy and permitted them to escape unpunished.\r\n\r\nQuite a time elapsed before the excitement subsided and the party\r\nrecovered from its dismay. The evil-doers could not as yet have gotten\r\nfar away, for the ground under the slit bags was damp and the blood of\r\nthe murdered guards was not quite dry. Stasch ordered the fugitives to\r\nbe pursued, not with the sole purpose of punishing them, but also to\r\nrecover the last two water-bags. Kali immediately mounted a horse and\r\nwith several riflemen started in pursuit. It occurred to Stasch, who had\r\nfirst thought of accompanying them, that because of the excitement and\r\nthe disturbed state of the negroes he could not possibly leave Nell\r\nalone with them; so he remained behind, but he ordered Kali to take Saba\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHe was greatly afraid there would be an uprising, and he felt sure that\r\nthe Samburus would revolt. But in this he was mistaken. Negroes are\r\ngiven to revolt, and sometimes even for trivial reasons, but when\r\noverpowered by misfortune, and especially when the merciless hand of\r\ndeath weighs heavily on them, they yield without making any attempt at\r\nresistance. This applies not only to those whom Islam has taught that it\r\nis useless to struggle against fate, but to all without exception. Then\r\nneither fear nor the agony of their last moments can awaken them from\r\ntheir lethargy. This was the case now. As soon as the first excitement\r\nwas over and the Wa-himas and the Samburus realized that they must\r\neventually die, they lay down quietly on the ground to wait for death;\r\ntherefore no rebellion was to be expected; on the contrary, it was\r\ndoubtful if they would get up the following morning and be willing to\r\ncontinue the journey.\r\n\r\nStasch felt deeply sorry for them.\r\n\r\nKali returned before daybreak, and immediately placed in front of Stasch\r\ntwo torn bags, in which not a drop of water remained.\r\n\r\n“Great Man,” he said, “Madi, apana!”\r\n\r\nStasch wiped his forehead, which was streaming with perspiration from\r\nfright and worry; then he asked:\r\n\r\n“And M’Kunji and M’Pua?”\r\n\r\n“M’Kunji and M’Pua are dead,” answered Kali.\r\n\r\n“You have killed them?”\r\n\r\n“Lion or wobo killed them!”\r\n\r\nAnd he began to relate what had happened. They found the corpses of the\r\ntwo criminals at quite a distance from the camp, where they had been\r\nkilled. They lay side by side; both had had their skulls crushed in from\r\nbehind, their shoulders torn, and their backs eaten. Kali conjectured\r\nthat a wobo or a lion had appeared before them in the moonlight and that\r\nthey had fallen on their faces to beseech it to spare their lives. But\r\nthe terrible beast had killed them both; then, having satisfied its\r\nappetite, it scented the water and tore the bags to pieces.\r\n\r\n“God has punished them,” said Stasch, “and the Wa-himas will now be\r\nconvinced that the wicked Msimu can save no one.”\r\n\r\nAnd Kali repeated:\r\n\r\n“God has punished them, but we have no water.”\r\n\r\n“Ahead of us, far off toward the east, I have seen mountains. There must\r\nbe water there.”\r\n\r\n“Kali has also seen them, but to get to them are many, many days——”\r\n\r\nA short silence ensued.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Kali, “good Msimu, Bibi, should pray to the Great Spirit for\r\nrain or for a stream of water.”\r\n\r\nStasch made no reply, but moved away. He saw Nell’s little white figure\r\nin front of the tent, for the screams and howls of the negroes had\r\nawakened her some time before.\r\n\r\n“Stasch, what has happened?” she asked, hurrying toward him.\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on her little head and said gravely:\r\n\r\n“Nell, pray to God for water—or we are all doomed to die!”\r\n\r\nAnd so the little girl raised her small, pale face to heaven; fixing her\r\neyes on the silver disk of the moon, she prayed for deliverance to Him\r\nwho in heaven guides the stars, and on earth tempers the wind to the\r\nshorn lamb.\r\n\r\nAfter a sleepless, noisy, and distracted night the sun appeared on the\r\nhorizon with the suddenness that prevails only at the equator; at once\r\nit was bright daylight. Not a drop of dew on the grass, not a cloud in\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nStasch ordered the riflemen to gather the negroes together, and he\r\naddressed a few words to them. He explained that it was impossible to\r\nreturn to the river, for they knew full well that they were five days’\r\nor five nights’ journey from it. But, on the other hand, no one could\r\ntell whether they might not find water in the opposite direction. In\r\ntheir immediate neighborhood a spring, a tiny stream, or a pool might be\r\nfound; for although no trees could be seen, it often happens that on\r\nopen plains where seeds are blown away by hurricanes there is water,\r\nthough no trees. The day before they had seen several large antelope and\r\nostriches running eastward, which was a sign that there must be a\r\nwatering-place somewhere in that direction. Therefore any one not a fool\r\nor chicken-hearted, but having a brave heart like the lion and buffalo,\r\nwould prefer to march on, even though suffering tortures from thirst,\r\nrather than to remain lying on the ground waiting for the hawks and\r\nhyenas to devour them. At these words he pointed with his hand to some\r\nhawks flying in circles over the caravan, the harbingers of disaster.\r\nNearly all the Wa-himas, whom Kali had ordered to arise, stood up when\r\nthey heard these words; being accustomed to despotic rule, they did not\r\ndare to show the least resistance. Many of the Samburus, however,\r\nbecause their king Faru had remained behind at the lake, did not want to\r\nget up again, and they said to one another: “Why should we seek death\r\nwhen death is seeking us?”\r\n\r\nThus the caravan, now reduced by nearly one-half, broke camp, and even\r\nthis exertion caused the men much torture and pain. For twenty-four\r\nhours no one had tasted a drop of water or any other liquid. Even in a\r\ncooler climate this would have caused most acute suffering, and what\r\nmust it mean to these—now laboring in this African furnace, in which,\r\neven if water be drunk in plenty, the perspiration follows so rapidly\r\nthat one can wipe it off his skin almost the same moment it is\r\nswallowed. It was certain that many of the party would collapse by the\r\nway from exhaustion and sunstroke. Stasch protected Nell from the sun as\r\nbest he could, and would not allow her for a second to put her head out\r\nof the palanquin, the roof of which, by the way, he had covered with a\r\npiece of white percale to make it a double protection against the\r\nblighting rays. He used the water still remaining in the rubber bag to\r\nmake some strong tea and served it to her without sugar, because sweets\r\nincrease thirst. The girl pleaded with tears in her eyes for him to\r\ndrink, too, and at last he put the bottle, in which scarcely a few\r\nthimblefuls of water remained, to his lips, and moving his throat,\r\npretended to drink. At the same moment, as he felt the touch of moisture\r\non his lips, it seemed to him as though a flame were burning in his\r\nchest and stomach, and that if he could not extinguish it he would drop\r\ndead. Red circles began to glimmer before his eyes, terrible stinging\r\npains shot through his jaw as of a thousand needles. His hand trembled\r\nso that he came near spilling the last precious drops, but he only\r\nmoistened his tongue and reserved the rest for Nell.\r\n\r\nAnother day of suffering and fatigue ensued, which was fortunately\r\nfollowed by a cool night. The next morning the burning heat again beat\r\ndown and not a breath of air was stirring. The sun, like a spirit of\r\nevil, devastated the parched soil with its deadly fire. The edge of the\r\nsky down near the horizon was a pale hue, and as far as the eye could\r\nreach not even a bush could be seen. Nothing—only a burned, desert\r\nplain, covered with tufts of blackened grass and heather. Occasionally a\r\nslight rumble of thunder was heard in the far distance, but coming from\r\na clear sky it was a sign of drought, not of rain.\r\n\r\nAt noon, when the heat was at its worst, it became necessary to halt.\r\nThe caravan rested in gloomy silence. Two horses had dropped down, and a\r\nnumber of negroes had fallen behind. During this rest no one thought\r\nabout eating. The eyes of all were sunken, their lips cracked, and on\r\nthem were dried clots of blood. Nell gasped like a languid little bird,\r\nso Stasch handed her two rubber-bags; and crying out, “I have drunk, I\r\nhave drunk!” ran toward the other side of the camp, fearing that if he\r\nremained he would take the water away from her or ask her to share it\r\nwith him. Perhaps this was the most heroic thing he had done during the\r\nentire journey. His sufferings increased under these tortures. Red\r\ncircles continually glimmered before his eyes. Such a terrible pressure\r\nwas in his jaws that he could open and shut them only with difficulty.\r\nHis throat was parched and feverishly hot, there was no saliva in his\r\nmouth, and his tongue was dry as wood.\r\n\r\nBut this was only the beginning of the torture for him and for the\r\ncaravan. The rumbling of thunder near the horizon, a sign of drought,\r\ncontinued. About three o’clock, when the sun turned toward the western\r\nside of the heavens, Stasch ordered the caravan to march. He placed\r\nhimself at its head and led it toward the east. He had now scarcely\r\nseventy men, and now and then one of these would lie down beside his\r\nburden never to rise again. The thermometer went down a few degrees, but\r\neven then it was murderously hot. The motionless air was filled with\r\nsuffocating humidity, and they could scarcely breathe. The animals also\r\nsuffered. Saba’s sides heaved up and down, and he panted laboriously;\r\nnot a drop of froth fell from his tongue, which was black and hanging\r\nout of his mouth. King, who was used to the dry African jungle, did not\r\nseem to suffer much, but still he began to be troublesome. A strange\r\nlight shone in his tiny eyes. He still answered Stasch, and especially\r\nNell, who occasionally talked to him, with a grunt, but when Kali\r\nthoughtlessly passed him by King snorted threateningly and waved his\r\ntrunk so frantically that the boy would probably have been killed had he\r\nnot sprung quickly aside.\r\n\r\nKali’s eyes were bloodshot, the veins of his throat were swollen, and\r\nhis lips were cracked like those of the other negroes. Toward five\r\no’clock he approached Stasch, and with great difficulty moved his throat\r\nsufficiently to say in a hollow voice:\r\n\r\n“Great Man, Kali can go no farther. He will stay here for the night.”\r\n\r\nStasch controlled the pain in his jaw and answered with difficulty:\r\n\r\n“All right; let us halt. The night will bring relief.”\r\n\r\n“It will bring death,” whispered the young negro. The negroes threw down\r\nthe burdens, but they did not lie down immediately, as the fever, which\r\nhad thickened their blood, was now at its height. Their hearts and the\r\npulses in hands and feet beat so heavily that it seemed they must burst.\r\nThe skin on their bodies, dry and shriveled, began to itch. In their\r\nbones they felt an intense restlessness, and a fiery heat seemed to\r\nconsume their throats and intestines. Many walked restlessly up and down\r\nbetween the piles of baggage. By the rays of the dying sun, others,\r\nfarther away, could be seen, following each other among the parched\r\nbushes until their strength was utterly exhausted. Then one by one they\r\nfell to the ground, not resting quietly, but twitching more\r\nspasmodically than before. Kali sat down, in Turkish fashion, next to\r\nStasch and Nell, with his mouth open and gasping for air. Between\r\nbreaths he begged beseechingly:\r\n\r\n“Bwana Kubwa, water!”\r\n\r\nStasch looked at him with a glassy stare and was silent.\r\n\r\n“Bwana Kubwa, water!”\r\n\r\nAnd after a while:\r\n\r\n“Kali die——”\r\n\r\nTherefore Mea, who for some reason was able to bear the thirst better\r\nthan any one else, sat down beside him, and putting her arms around his\r\nneck, said in a soft, melodious voice:\r\n\r\n“Mea will die along with Kali——”\r\n\r\nA long pause ensued.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun went down and the night clothed the landscape in\r\ndarkness. The heavens became dark blue. In the southern sky shone the\r\ncross. Over the plain glittered myriads of stars. The moon rose and its\r\nlight pervaded the darkness, and in the west the pale twilight of the\r\nzodiac spread far and wide. The atmosphere became a huge glittering\r\nflood. An even more brilliant glow spread over the landscape. The\r\npalanquin, which they forgot to remove from King’s back, and the tents\r\nshone as if made of white marble. The world sank into deathlike silence;\r\nsleep enveloped the earth. And in the midst of nature’s tranquil\r\npeacefulness Stasch and his followers writhed in pain, waiting for\r\ndeath. On the silver background of the twilight the huge form of the\r\nelephant stood out distinctly. The moonlight illuminated the tent,\r\nStasch’s and Nell’s white clothes, the spaces between the bushes of\r\nheather, the dark, cramped, and distorted bodies of the negroes and the\r\nbaggage-strewn ground. Saba sat on his hind legs in front of the\r\nchildren and howled sadly with head turned toward the moon. Not a\r\nthought was left in the soul of Stasch—nothing but dumb despair. He\r\nfelt there was no help, no way out, that all their terrible fatigue and\r\nhardships, all the sufferings and courageous deeds done on the terrible\r\njourney—from Medinet to Khartum, from Khartum to Fashoda, from Fashoda\r\nto the unknown lake—had been utterly useless, and that they could not\r\nescape the inexorable end of the struggle—death. It appeared all the\r\nmore dreadful to him since it would come on the last stretch of the\r\njourney—at whose end lay the ocean. Oh, he could never take Nell to the\r\ncoast, nor put her on the ship for Port Said; he could never give her\r\nback to her father, nor fall into his father’s arms and hear him say\r\nthat he had acted like a brave boy and a true Pole! It was all over! In\r\na few days the sun would shine but on lifeless bodies; then it would dry\r\nthem up like the mummies that sleep the everlasting sleep in Egyptian\r\nmuseums!\r\n\r\nHis brain was turning from the pain and heat and fever; he saw visions\r\nof death struggles, and there came to him strange sounds. He distinctly\r\nheard the voices of the Sudanese and the Bedouins crying, “Yalla!\r\nYalla!” as they mercilessly whipped their frightened camels. He saw\r\nIdris and Gebhr. The Mahdi smiled at him with his thick lips and asked:\r\n“Will you drink of the fountain of truth?” A lion standing on a rock\r\ngazed at him, then Linde gave him a jar of quinine and said: “Make\r\nhaste, for the little one is dying!” Then he only saw a pale, sweet\r\nlittle face and two little hands stretched toward him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he shuddered; for a moment consciousness came back to\r\nhim—close to his ear Nell’s soft, sad, pleading voice whispered:\r\n\r\n“Stasch—water!”\r\n\r\nShe, as did Kali, rested her hope on him. But as he had given her the\r\nlast drops of water twelve hours before, he now controlled himself and\r\ncried out with a voice full of emotion, pain, and despair:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Nell, I only pretended to drink! For the last three days I have not\r\ntasted a drop!”\r\n\r\nAnd holding his head in despair, he ran away that he might not see how\r\nshe suffered. Blindly up and down between the tufts of grass and heather\r\nhe ran, until his strength was utterly exhausted and he sank down on one\r\nof the bushes. No weapon of any kind was in his hand. A leopard, lion,\r\nor even a large hyena would have found him easy prey. But only Saba came\r\nrunning up, sniffing at him and howling, as if he, too, were asking for\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nNo one came to their assistance. Only the calm, indifferent moon looked\r\ndown upon them from above. For a long time the boy lay as if lifeless.\r\nWhen a cooler breath of wind, unexpectedly blowing from the east,\r\nrestored him to his senses, he raised himself and tried to stand and go\r\nto Nell.\r\n\r\nNow there blew another cool breath of wind. Saba ceased to howl, turned\r\ntoward the east, and began to expand his nostrils. Suddenly he barked\r\nonce in a sharp bass tone and then a second time, and ran on straight\r\nahead. For a time he seemed to be silent, but soon his bark was heard in\r\nthe distance. Stasch stood up, and staggering about on his benumbed\r\nlegs, looked in the direction taken by Saba. The lengthy journeys, the\r\nlong sojourn in the jungle, the necessity of keeping all his senses\r\nstrung up to their highest pitch, and the incessant dangers he had\r\nencountered had taught the boy to observe everything that was going on\r\nabout him. And so, notwithstanding the tortures he suffered at the\r\nmoment, and though he was only semi-conscious, he began from instinct to\r\nnote the movements of the dog. After a while Saba returned, but he\r\nseemed disturbed and very restless. Several times he looked up at\r\nStasch, walked around him, ran away in the heather sniffing and barking,\r\nand again returned, and at last taking hold of the boy’s clothes, he\r\nbegan to drag him toward the opposite side of the camp.\r\n\r\nStasch had now fully regained his presence of mind.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” he thought. “Either the dog has gone mad from thirst or\r\nhe has scented water. But no!— If there were water near by he would\r\nhave run there to drink and his throat would be wet. But if the water be\r\nfar off he has not scented it—for water has no scent. He is not pulling\r\nme toward some kind of prey, for this evening he refused to eat. Then\r\nwhat can it mean?”\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly his heart began to beat faster in his breast.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the wind has brought him the scent of human beings?—\r\nPerhaps—perhaps there is a negro village in the distance?—perhaps one\r\nof the kites— O merciful Jesus! O Jesus!——”\r\n\r\nA faint ray of hope spurred him on; he felt stronger and tried to run\r\ntoward the camp, in spite of the resistance of the dog, who continually\r\nbarred the way. From the camp Nell’s white form shone out and her weak\r\nvoice reached him; soon afterward he stumbled over Kali lying on the\r\nground, but he took no heed of anything. Reaching the piece of baggage\r\nin which the rockets were kept, he tore it open, took one out, with\r\ntrembling hands bound it to a bamboo post, pushed it into the earth, and\r\nlighted the fuse.\r\n\r\nSoon a red snake shot up, spluttering noisily into the air. Stasch\r\ncaught hold of the bamboo rod with both hands to prevent himself from\r\nfalling, and gazed fixedly into the distance. The pulses in his hands\r\nand temples beat hard and his lips moved in fervent prayer. He felt that\r\nin this his last breath his heart was calling on Heaven for help.\r\n\r\nA second, a third, a fourth minute elapsed. Nothing—and again nothing!\r\nThe boy’s hands fell at his side, his head sank to the ground, and\r\ndreadful pain filled his tortured breast.\r\n\r\n“In vain! In vain!” he moaned. “I shall go and sit down by Nell, and we\r\nshall die together.”\r\n\r\nAt the same moment far, far off in the silvery background of the moonlit\r\nnight a fiery streak rose into the air and broke into golden stars,\r\nwhich slowly fell to the ground like large tears.\r\n\r\n“We are saved!” cried Stasch.\r\n\r\nThen the people, half dead but a moment ago, sprang up, running to and\r\nfro, jumping over the grass and tufts of heather. After the first\r\nrocket, a second and a third were sent up. Then a gust of wind brought\r\nthe echo of a peculiar cracking sound, very evidently caused by distant\r\nshots. In reply Stasch ordered all the rifles fired off, and from that\r\ntime the guns answered each other without intermission, and the noises\r\nbecame more and more distinct. The boy now mounted a horse, which also\r\nhad—as if by a miracle—regained some strength, and holding Nell before\r\nhim, galloped over the plain toward the sound of deliverance. Saba ran\r\nalongside, and behind him tramped the huge King. The two camps were\r\nseveral kilometers apart, but each party was hurrying toward the other,\r\nand so the ride was not a long one. The flashes from the guns could now\r\nbe seen. Another rocket, the last, arose in the air, at a distance of\r\nnot more than several hundred feet away. Then numerous lights shone. A\r\nslight swell of the ground hid them for a while, but when Stasch mounted\r\nit he found himself face to face with a line of negroes holding burning\r\ntorches in their hands.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the line marched two Europeans wearing English helmets\r\nand carrying guns.\r\n\r\nAt a glance Stasch recognized Captain Glen and Dr. Clary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Captain Glen and Dr. Clary certainly was not organized\r\nto seek Stasch and Nell. It was a large and well-equipped government\r\nexpedition, sent out to explore the northeast slopes of the giant\r\nmountain Kilima-Njaro, and also the but little known large tracts to the\r\nnorth of this mountain. It is true that the Captain and the Doctor knew\r\nabout the kidnapping of the children from Medinet el-Fayoum, for English\r\nand Arabic newspapers had published accounts of it, but they thought\r\nthat both had died or else were languishing as prisoners of the Mahdi,\r\nfrom whom not a single European captive had regained his freedom. Clary,\r\nwhose sister was married to Rawlison of Bombay, and who on his trip to\r\nCairo had been quite taken with little Nell, missed her very much. But\r\nthey were also very sorry for the brave boy. They had sent several\r\ntelegrams from Mombasa to Mr. Rawlison asking whether the children had\r\nbeen found, and only after the last unfavorable answer, which arrived\r\nsome time before the departure of the caravan, did they finally give up\r\nevery hope of finding them.\r\n\r\nIt never even occurred to them that the children, who were kidnapped in\r\ndistant Khartum, might turn up in this district. But in the evenings,\r\nafter the day’s work was over, they often conversed about them, for the\r\ndoctor could not forget the beautiful little girl.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the caravan advanced still farther. After staying quite some\r\ntime on the eastern slopes of Kilima-Njaro and exploring the upper\r\ncourse of the rivers Sabaki and Tana, as well as the Kenia Mountains,\r\nthe captain and the doctor turned off northward, and after having\r\ncrossed the swampy Guasso-Nyjro, came into a wide, uninhabited plain,\r\nover which roamed only innumerable herds of antelope. After a journey of\r\nmore than three months, the people needed a longer rest, and so Captain\r\nGlen, after having come to a fairly large lake containing plenty of\r\nbrown but healthy water, ordered the tents to be erected on its banks\r\nfor a ten days’ halt.\r\n\r\nDuring the preparations for camping the white people busied themselves\r\nwith hunting and sorting their geographical and natural science notes,\r\nand the negroes fell into their well-beloved idleness. It happened one\r\nday that Dr. Clary, rising early, and approaching the shore, saw several\r\nZanzibar negroes belonging to the caravan with their faces upturned\r\nlooking at the top of a tall tree and repeating over and over again:\r\n\r\n“Ndege? Akuna ndege! Ndege?”—“A bird? No bird! A bird?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor was shortsighted, so he sent to the tent for a telescope;\r\nthen he looked through it at the object to which the negroes pointed,\r\nand great surprise showed on his face:\r\n\r\n“Call the captain here!” he said.\r\n\r\nBefore the negroes had reached him the captain appeared outside the\r\ntent; he was about to start on an antelope hunt.\r\n\r\n“Glen, look!” cried the doctor, pointing upward.\r\n\r\nThe captain raised his head, covered his eyes with his hands, and showed\r\nas much surprise as did the doctor.\r\n\r\n“A kite!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but negroes don’t send up kites! Where can it come from?”\r\n\r\n“There may be a settlement of white people or a mission in the\r\nneighborhood——”\r\n\r\n“This is the third day the wind has blown from the west, over a region\r\nas unknown and perhaps as uninhabited as is this jungle. Besides, you\r\nknow that there are no settlements or missions hereabouts.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, it is very strange and interesting.”\r\n\r\n“We must certainty take down the kite.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Perhaps then we shall find out where it came from.”\r\n\r\nThe captain gave a short order. The tree was several feet high, but in a\r\nmoment the negroes had reached the top, carefully unfastened the kite,\r\ntaken it down, and handed it to the doctor, who examined it quickly and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“There’s writing on it—let us look!”\r\n\r\nAnd in order to see better he half closed his eyes and began to read:\r\n\r\nSuddenly his face changed and his hand trembled.\r\n\r\n“Glen,” he said, “take that; read it through, and convince me that I\r\nhave not had a sun-stroke, and that I am still in my right senses!”\r\n\r\nThe captain took the bamboo frame to which the sheet of paper was\r\nattached and read the following:\r\n\r\n    “Nell Rawlison and Stanislaus Tarkowski, who were sent from\r\n    Khartum to Fashoda, and were transported from Fashoda to the\r\n    east of the Nile, have freed themselves from the hands of the\r\n    Dervishes. After a journey of many months they have arrived at a\r\n    lake which lies to the south of Abyssinia. They are going to the\r\n    ocean. They beg for help.”\r\n\r\nAnd on the other side of the sheet was found the following postscript:\r\n\r\n    “This, the fifty-fifth kite, was sent up from a group of\r\n    mountains which surrounds a lake not mentioned in geography.\r\n    Whosoever finds it should send the news to the canal\r\n    administration in Port Said, or to Captain Glen in Mombasa.”\r\n\r\n                                              Stanislaus Tarkowski.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain’s voice had ceased the two friends silently regarded\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n“What does it mean?” at last asked Dr. Clary.\r\n\r\n“I can’t believe my eyes!” answered the captain.\r\n\r\n“But is there no mistake?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“There it is, plainly written: ‘Nell Rawlison and Stanislaus Tarkowski.’\r\n”\r\n\r\n“There it is as plain as can be——”\r\n\r\n“And perhaps they may be in this vicinity?”\r\n\r\n“So God has apparently saved them.”\r\n\r\n“All thanks be to Him!” cried the doctor enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“But in what direction shall we look for them?”\r\n\r\n“Is there nothing more on the kite?”\r\n\r\n“There were several other words, but on a part torn by the branches; it\r\nis hard to read them.”\r\n\r\nBoth leaned their heads over the paper, and only after a lengthy\r\nexamination were they able to spell:\r\n\r\n“The rainy season has long since passed.”\r\n\r\n“What does that mean?” asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“That the boy has lost his reckoning of time.”\r\n\r\n“And in this way he tried to give the date as best he could.”\r\n\r\n“You are right. So this kite can not have been sent up such a very long\r\nwhile ago.”\r\n\r\n“If that is the case, then they can not be very far off by this time.”\r\n\r\nThis feverish, abrupt conversation lasted a little longer; then they\r\nboth began to inspect the document again and to consider every word\r\nwritten on it. But it all seemed so improbable, that had it not come\r\nfrom a place where not even one European could be found—more than six\r\nhundred kilometers distant from the nearest coast—the doctor and the\r\ncaptain would have been inclined to think it a joke played by European\r\nor mission children after having read in the newspapers about the\r\nkidnapping. Still it was hard for them not to believe their eyes; for\r\nthey had the kite in their hands, and the inscription, being scarcely\r\nblurred at all, was quite distinct.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, there were many things about it that they could not\r\nunderstand. Where could the children have procured the paper for the\r\nkites? If they had obtained it from a caravan, they would have joined\r\nthe caravan, and so would not have been obliged to ask for assistance.\r\nWhy had the boy not tried to escape to Abyssinia with his little\r\ncompanion? Why had the Dervishes sent them to the east of the Nile in an\r\nunknown country? How had they been able to escape from the Dervishes?\r\nWhere were they hiding? By what miracle had they not starved to death\r\nduring this journey of many months? By what miracle had they not become\r\nthe prey of wild beasts? Why had the savages not killed them? To all\r\nthese questions they could find no answers.\r\n\r\n“I can’t understand it. I can’t understand it!” repeated Dr. Clary. “It\r\nsurely is a miracle of God’s working.”\r\n\r\n“It would seem so!” answered the captain.\r\n\r\nThen he added:\r\n\r\n“But there’s a fine boy for you! This must be his work!”\r\n\r\n“And he did not leave the little one in the lurch. God bless his head\r\nand his heart.”\r\n\r\n“Stanley—yes, even Stanley—placed as he was, could not have kept up\r\nover three days.”\r\n\r\n“And they are still alive!”\r\n\r\n“But they beg for help. What’s past is past. We must depart\r\nimmediately.”\r\n\r\nAnd so they set out. On the way the two friends continually re-examined\r\nthe document, trusting that they might find directions on it to guide\r\nthem in going to the children’s assistance. But no such directions were\r\nfound. The captain led the caravan in a zigzag path, hoping he might\r\nfind some trace of them—the remains of some campfire or a tree with\r\nmarks cut into the bark. In this way they traveled on for several days,\r\nwhen unfortunately they found themselves on a treeless plain, covered\r\nwith tall heather and tufts of dried grass. The two travelers were now\r\nvery much alarmed. How easy, they thought, was it to miss even a large\r\ncaravan on these vast prairies and how much easier it was to miss two\r\nchildren, who, as they supposed, were creeping along somewhere in the\r\ntall heather like two little worms. Another day passed. Neither the tin\r\ncans with notes inside them which they left behind them tied to bushes,\r\nnor the watch-fires burning during the night were of any avail. The\r\ncaptain and the doctor from time to time began to lose hope of ever\r\nfinding the children; indeed, they felt quite sure they were no longer\r\nalive. Nevertheless, they continued searching diligently for several\r\ndays. At last the scouts whom Glen sent out to reconnoiter brought news\r\nthat in front of them lay an absolutely arid desert; so when they\r\naccidentally came across water in a hollow of the ground they were\r\nobliged to halt to make provision for the coming journey.\r\n\r\nThe hollow was several feet deep and very narrow. At its bottom a hot\r\nspring bubbled and boiled, for it was saturated with carbonic gas. The\r\nwater when cooled proved to be good and wholesome. There was so much\r\nwater in the spring that thirty men of their caravan were unable to\r\nempty it. On the contrary, the more water they dipped out the higher it\r\nspurted forth.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps in time,” said Dr. Clary, “invalids will come here to be cured\r\nby this water, but at present the steep side of the cliff renders it\r\ninaccessible even to animals. Can it be possible that the children have\r\nfound a similar spring?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Perhaps there are more like these in this part of the\r\ncountry. If not, the children will surely die of thirst.”\r\n\r\nThe night approached. They lighted several fires, but no boma was\r\nerected, for they could find no materials with which to build it.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the doctor and the captain sat down on camp-stools, lighted\r\ntheir pipes, and began to converse on the subject that weighed most\r\nheavily on their hearts.\r\n\r\n“Not the least trace!” Clary began.\r\n\r\n“It had occurred to me,” answered Glen, “to send ten of our people to\r\nthe coast with a telegram, stating that news from the children had been\r\nreceived. But I am glad that I did not send it, for the messengers would\r\nmost likely have given out on the way, and even if they had reached\r\ntheir destination, what good would it do to raise false hopes——”\r\n\r\n“And increase their grief——”\r\n\r\nThe doctor removed his white helmet and wiped his perspiring forehead.\r\n“Listen,” said he. “Suppose we were to return to that lake, and have\r\nniches cut in the bark of the trees and large fires burning by night!\r\nPerhaps the children would see these signs.”\r\n\r\n“If they are in the neighborhood we would not need to take these means\r\nto find them, and if they are far away the rise in the ground would hide\r\nthe fires. This plateau only appears to be level; in reality it is\r\ncovered with ridges and waves like the ocean. Besides, if we were to\r\nretrace our steps we would lose all hope of finding a vestige of them.”\r\n\r\n“Speak plainly. You have lost all hope?”\r\n\r\n“My friend, we are grown, strong, experienced men; just imagine what\r\nwould have become of us if we had been stranded here by ourselves, even\r\nif supplied with water, had we no provisions or men!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, unfortunately—yes, I can picture to myself two children traveling\r\nthrough the desert on a night like this——”\r\n\r\n“Hunger, thirst, and wild animals——”\r\n\r\n“And yet the boy writes that they have dragged through long months in\r\nthis way.”\r\n\r\n“I can not possibly imagine it.”\r\n\r\nFor a long time all that disturbed the silence of the night was the\r\ncrackling of the tobacco in their pipes. The doctor stared into the pale\r\ndepth of the night, and then in a suppressed voice said:\r\n\r\n“It is now late; but I can not sleep. And to think that, if they are\r\nstill alive, perhaps they are wandering around here somewhere in the\r\nmoonlight between these dried tufts of heather—alone—such young\r\nchildren! Glen, do you remember the angel face of the little one?”\r\n\r\n“I remember it perfectly, and shall not forget it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I would gladly have my hand cut off if——”\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence, for Captain Glen jumped up as suddenly\r\nas if scalding water had been poured over him.\r\n\r\n“A rocket in the distance!” he cried. “A rocket!”\r\n\r\n“A rocket!” repeated the doctor.\r\n\r\n“There must be a caravan ahead of us.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it has come across the children!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. Let us make haste to meet them.”\r\n\r\n“Forward!”\r\n\r\nThe captain’s orders were at once heard throughout the camp. The\r\nZanzibar negroes sprang to their feet. Torches were lighted, and in\r\nanswer to the distant signals Glen ordered rockets sent up in rapid\r\nsuccession and shots to be fired.\r\n\r\nIn less than a quarter of an hour the entire camp was on its way.\r\n\r\nFrom a distance were heard shots responding to theirs. There was no\r\nlonger any doubt but that some European caravan was for some unknown\r\nreason asking for help.\r\n\r\nThe captain and the doctor ran as fast as they possibly could,\r\nalternately hoping and fearing. Would they find the children or not? The\r\ndoctor said to himself that if they did not find them they could at\r\nleast search for their bodies in the dreadful heather-fields.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later one of those ridges of which they had spoken shut off\r\nthe view from the two friends. But they were now so near that they\r\ndistinctly heard the tramping of horses. A few minutes more and a rider\r\nappeared on the top of a hillock; he held a large white object in front\r\nof him on the saddle.\r\n\r\n“Hold the torches high!” commanded Glen.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the rider brought his horse to a standstill within\r\nthe circle of lights.\r\n\r\n“Water! Water!”\r\n\r\n“The children!” cried Dr. Clary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  “ ‘Water! Water!’ repeated Stasch.” ]\r\n\r\n                  “ ‘The children!’ cried Dr. Clary.”\r\n\r\n“Water!” repeated Stasch.\r\n\r\nAnd he almost threw Nell into the arms of the captain and then he sprang\r\nout of the saddle. The next moment he staggered to the ground as if\r\nlifeless.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThe rejoicing of the rescuers was boundless, but the credulity of the\r\ntwo Englishmen was put to a severe test, as they had been unable to\r\ncomprehend how the children by themselves had been able to travel over\r\nthe measureless tracts of land and the deserts which separated their\r\npresent position from the Nile and Fashoda; neither could they\r\nconjecture how “the young Pole,” as they called Stasch, could have done\r\nit, and how it was that he appeared before them as the leader of a large\r\ncaravan—armed with European weapons—with an elephant who carried a\r\npalanquin, with horses, tents, and a considerable amount of provisions.\r\nAt this astounding sight the captain stretched out his hands, saying\r\nover and over again: “Clary, I have seen a great deal in my life, but\r\nnever a boy like this,” and the good doctor, equally astonished, said:\r\n\r\n“And he released the little one from captivity—and saved her!” After\r\nhaving made this remark, he ran to the tents to see how the children\r\nwere and if they were sleeping comfortably.\r\n\r\nAfter they had had food and drink, the children were undressed and put\r\nto bed, and slept during the whole of the following day as soundly as if\r\nthey were dead, and so did the men belonging to their caravan. Captain\r\nGlen attempted to question Kali about their adventures and about\r\nStasch’s part in them, but the young negro merely opened one eye and\r\nanswered: “The Great Man can do everything,” and went to sleep again. So\r\nthey were obliged to put off their questions until the following day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two friends consulted with each other as to the journey\r\nback to Mombasa. They had already traveled farther and explored larger\r\ntracts than their commission called for, and so they decided to return\r\nat once. The unknown lake had a great fascination for the captain, but\r\nthe welfare of the children and the desire to take them back to their\r\ngrief-stricken fathers as soon as possible turned the scales. The doctor\r\ninsisted that at present they should take a good rest on the cool\r\nsummits of the Kenia or Kilima-Njaro Mountains. They also decided not to\r\nsend word to the children’s fathers until they reached the mountains,\r\nand then tell them to come to Mombasa.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, after they were well rested and had bathed several\r\ntimes, they started on their return journey. Now they were obliged to\r\npart from Kali. Stasch convinced the little one that it would be selfish\r\nfor her to take him with them to the ocean, or even as far as Egypt, for\r\neven in England Kali would be nothing more than a servant, while if he\r\nwere to rule over his people he could, as king, spread the Christian\r\nreligion and ameliorate the savage customs of the Wa-himas, and not only\r\ncivilize them, but make them good. He also expressed similar sentiments\r\nto Kali. Many tears were shed at parting. Stasch was not ashamed to\r\nweep, for had not he and Nell been through much happiness and misery in\r\ncommon with Kali? And not only had they both learned to appreciate his\r\nkind heart, but they had also grown very fond of him. The young negro\r\nlay a long time at the feet of his Bwana Kubwa and of the “good Msimu.”\r\nHe turned back twice to look at them, but at last the moment of parting\r\nhad come, and the two caravans separated, going in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nIt was only after they were under way that the adventures of the two\r\nlittle travelers were told. Stasch, who used to be so fond of boasting,\r\ndid not sound his own praises at all now, for he had accomplished so\r\nmany things and gone through so much that he had developed sufficiently\r\nto recognize that facts speak louder than words—that deeds alone, even\r\nwhen told as modestly as possible, speak for themselves. Daily, during\r\nthe hot “white hours,” and evenings in the bivouac, the events and\r\nadventures which the children had suffered passed before the eyes of the\r\ncaptain and the doctor like moving pictures. In this way they saw them\r\ncarried off from Medinet-el-Fayoum, and the terrible journey on camels\r\nthrough the desert—Khartum and Omdurman, which was a hell on earth—and\r\nthe designing Mahdi. When Stasch told how he had replied to the Mahdi\r\nwhen the latter wanted him to change his religion, the two friends arose\r\nand each of them in turn grasped Stasch’s right hand firmly. Then the\r\ncaptain said:\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi is not living now!”\r\n\r\n“The Mahdi not living now!” repeated Stasch, surprised.\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” the doctor continued. “He was suffocated in his own fat,\r\nor, properly speaking, he died of fatty degeneration of the heart, and\r\nAbdullah[49] has taken command.”\r\n\r\nA long pause ensued.\r\n\r\n“Ha!” said Stasch. “When he sent us to meet our death in Fashoda he had\r\nno idea that death would overtake him first.”\r\n\r\nAnd after a while he added:\r\n\r\n“But Abdullah is even more cruel than the Mahdi.”\r\n\r\n“And that has led to the present revolts and slaughter,” answered the\r\ncaptain, “and the whole structure of government which the Mahdi erected\r\nis bound to fall sooner or later.”\r\n\r\n“And what will happen then?”\r\n\r\n“England,” answered the captain.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of the journey Stasch told them about the trip to\r\nFashoda, about the death of old Dinah, their departure from Fashoda,\r\ntheir journey to uninhabited districts, and their search for Smain. When\r\nhe came to the part where he had killed the lion and then Gebhr and\r\nChamis and the two Bedouins, the captain interrupted him, exclaiming,\r\n“All right!” and once more grasping his right hand. He and Clary\r\ncontinued to listen with increasing interest about the taming of King,\r\ntheir dwelling in “Cracow,” Nell’s fever, the finding of Linde, and the\r\nkites, which the children sent up from the Karamajo Mountains. The\r\ndoctor, who grew fonder of little Nell day by day, was so especially\r\ninterested in all that had threatened to harm her that from time to time\r\nhe had to strengthen himself with a drop of brandy, and when Stasch\r\nbegan to relate how she had nearly become the prey of the terrible wobo\r\nhe took the little girl in his arms, and would not let her go for some\r\ntime, as if afraid that some new beast of prey might threaten her life.\r\n\r\nWhat he and the captain thought of Stasch was expressed in two telegrams\r\nwhich they sent off two weeks later (after they had reached the foot of\r\nKilima-Njaro) by messengers, who had orders to forward as soon as\r\npossible to the two fathers.\r\n\r\nThe first telegram was carefully worded and sent to Port Said. It was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Thanks to the boy, have good news of the children. Come to\r\n    Mombasa.”\r\n\r\nThe second was more explicit and addressed to Aden. It read:\r\n\r\n    “The children are safe in our hands. The boy a hero!”\r\n\r\nThey made a halt of two weeks on the cool summits of Kilima-Njaro, for\r\nDr. Clary urged this on account of the health of Nell and of Stasch. The\r\nchildren adored this sky-high mountain, which possessed every kind of\r\nclimate imaginable. Its two peaks, Kibo and Mawenzi, were usually\r\nclothed in thick mists during the day, but when the mists suddenly\r\nlifted on clear evenings the everlasting snows on the summit of Mawenzi\r\nshone with a rosy glow, reflected from the sunset, while all the rest of\r\nthe world was already wrapped in darkness—the mountain resembled a\r\nshining altar of God. At this sight the children unconsciously folded\r\ntheir hands in prayer.\r\n\r\nFor Stasch the days of worry, anxiety, and trouble were over. They now\r\nhad a journey of a month before reaching Mombasa, and the road lay\r\nthrough the beautiful but unhealthy Tawet forest. How much easier was it\r\nnow to travel over well-known roads with a numerous and well-equipped\r\ncaravan than to wander around in an unknown wilderness accompanied by\r\nKali and Mea. Besides, Captain Glen now took charge of the journey.\r\nStasch recovered and went hunting. Having found a chisel and hammer\r\namong the tools of the caravan, he set to work during the cool hours to\r\nchisel on a large gneiss rock the following inscription: “Poland is not\r\nlost yet!” for he wished to leave at least a trace of their sojourn in\r\nthis country. The Englishmen, to whom he translated the inscription,\r\nwere surprised that the boy had not thought of perpetuating his own name\r\nby carving it on a rock in Africa. But he preferred the sentiments he\r\nhad chiseled on it.\r\n\r\nHe continued to protect Nell, and this gave her such an unlimited\r\nconfidence in him that when Dr. Clary asked her whether she was not\r\nafraid of the storms on the Red Sea, the girl rested her beautiful soft\r\neyes on him and replied, “Stasch will know what to do!” Captain Glen\r\nsaid that no one could have given a truer and more beautiful proof of\r\nwhat Stasch was to the little one or given him higher praise.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nAlthough the first telegram sent to Mr. Tarkowski at Port Said was very\r\ncarefully worded, it produced such a great effect on Nell’s father that\r\nhe nearly died of joy, and Mr. Tarkowski, although an unusually\r\ndemonstrative man, knelt down to pray and besought God that this news\r\nmight not be another false clue or the result of a diseased imagination\r\nbrought about by their own longing and their grief. For had they not\r\nboth done everything trying to ascertain if their children were still\r\nalive? Mr. Rawlison had led caravans to the Sudan, and Mr. Tarkowski,\r\ndressed as an Arab, had gone as far as Khartum, thereby greatly\r\nendangering his life. Nothing had been of any avail. Those who might\r\nhave given them some news had died from smallpox or from hunger or had\r\nbeen killed in the bloody fights that were continually being waged, and\r\nthere seemed no more trace of the children than if they had fallen into\r\nthe water and disappeared. At last both fathers gave up all hope and\r\nonly lived on remembrances, firmly convinced that there was nothing in\r\nlife for them, and that death alone would reunite them to their loved\r\nones, who were everything to them. When this great joy suddenly came to\r\nthem it was almost more than they could bear; nevertheless, it was\r\naccompanied by uncertainty and surprise. Neither of them could\r\ncomprehend how and in what manner the news of the children had come from\r\nthis part of Africa; that is to say, from Mombasa. Mr. Tarkowski\r\nimagined that an Arab caravan, advancing from the eastern coast after\r\nhaving been in the interior hunting for ivory, had reached the Nile and\r\nhad either bought their freedom or had stolen them. The words of the\r\ntelegram, “thanks to the boy,” they accounted for in the following\r\nmanner: They conjectured that Stasch must have written to the captain\r\nand the doctor and told them where he and Nell were to be found. But\r\nthere were many things which it was impossible to explain. On the other\r\nhand, Mr. Tarkowski clearly saw that this was not only _good_ news, but\r\n_very_ good news, for otherwise the captain and the doctor would not\r\nhave dared to arouse their hopes, and besides, they would not have told\r\nthem to come to Mombasa.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the journey were soon made, and on the second day\r\nafter receiving the telegrams both engineers, with Nell’s governess,\r\nboarded a large steamer of the Peninsula and Orient Company, which was\r\non its way to India, and stopped en route at Aden, Mombasa, and\r\nZanzibar. In Aden a second telegram awaited them, which read: “The\r\nchildren are safe in our care. The boy a hero!” After he had read it Mr.\r\nRawlison, nearly beside himself, continually repeated as he grasped Mr.\r\nTarkowski’s hand:\r\n\r\n“You see—he saved her—I owe her life to him——” and Mr. Tarkowski\r\nrepressed his feelings, so as not to appear weak, compressed his lips,\r\nand answered: “Yes, the boy has been brave,” and entering his cabin, he\r\nwept for joy.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nAt last the moment came when the children threw themselves into the arms\r\nof their fathers. Mr. Rawlison took his regained treasure in his arms,\r\nand Mr. Tarkowski held his heroic boy pressed to his heart in a long\r\nembrace. Their calamities had passed by as hurricanes and storms pass\r\nover the desert. Life was once more filled with sunlight and happiness,\r\ntheir longing and separation even increasing their present rejoicing.\r\nBut the children were greatly surprised that their fathers’ hair had\r\nbecome quite white during the separation.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThey returned to Suez on a French boat of the Messageries Maritimes,\r\nwhich was crowded with passengers from the islands of Réunion,\r\nMauritius, and from Madagascar, and Zanzibar. When the news that there\r\nwere children on board who had been taken captive by the Dervishes and\r\nescaped had become known, Stasch was made the center of general\r\ncuriosity and admiration. But the happy quartet preferred to shut\r\nthemselves up in the large cabin, which the captain had given up to\r\nthem, and pass the cool hours relating their adventures. Nell also took\r\npart, chattering like a little bird, and to the great amusement of\r\neverybody she commenced every sentence with “and.” Resting on her\r\nfather’s knees and raising her lovely eyes to him, she talked somewhat\r\nlike this: “And, papa, dear! And they carried us off and led us on\r\ncamels—and Gebhr beat me—and Stasch protected me—and we arrived in\r\nKhartum—and there people died of hunger—and Stasch worked, so as to\r\nget dates for me—and we were with the Mahdi—and Stasch would not\r\nchange his religion—and the Mahdi sent us to Fashoda—and then Stasch\r\nkilled a lion and all—and we lived in a large tree called “Cracow”—and\r\nKing was with us—and I had the fever—and Stasch cured me—and he\r\nkilled a wobo—and conquered the Samburus—and—papa, dear—he was\r\nalways very good to me——”\r\n\r\nShe also spoke of Kali, Mea, King, Saba, Linde and his mountain, and of\r\nthe kite sent up just previous to meeting the captain and the doctor.\r\nMr. Rawlison could with difficulty suppress his tears during this\r\nchatter, pressed his child more closely to his heart; and Mr. Tarkowski\r\nwas so overcome with pride that he could not control himself, for even\r\nfrom this childish talk it could readily be seen that had it not been\r\nfor the ability and energy of the boy the little one would have been\r\nhopelessly lost, not only once, but many times.\r\n\r\nStasch gave an exact account of everything, and while telling of the\r\njourney from Fashoda to the waterfall, a great load fell from his chest,\r\nfor when he told how he had shot Gebhr and his followers, he stopped and\r\nlooked uneasily at his father—but Mr. Tarkowski frowned, thought a\r\nwhile, and then said gravely:\r\n\r\n“Listen, Stasch! One ought never kill any one, but if any one threaten\r\nyour country, or the life of your mother or sister, or the life of a\r\nwoman placed in your care, then unquestionably shoot him, and without\r\nany qualms of conscience—and never feel any remorse.”\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Port Said Mr. Rawlison and Nell went to England, where\r\nthey took up their residence. Stasch’s father sent him to a school in\r\nAlexandria, for there his deeds and adventures were not so well known.\r\nThe children wrote to each other almost every day, but it so happened\r\nthat they did not see each other for ten years. After the boy had\r\ncompleted his studies in Egypt he attended the Polytechnic School in\r\nZürich, and on receiving his diploma engaged in tunnel work in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nIt was ten years later, when Mr. Tarkowski retired, that they both\r\nvisited their friends in England. Mr. Rawlison invited them to spend the\r\nentire summer at his house near Hampton Court. Nell had passed her\r\neighteenth birthday, and had grown up a lovely girl, blooming like a\r\nrose; and Stasch found, at the cost of his peace of mind, that a man of\r\ntwenty-four is not too young to think of the ladies. In fact, he thought\r\nso continually of the beautiful and well-beloved Nell that he felt like\r\nrunning off wherever his eyes would lead him and his feet would carry\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut one day Mr. Rawlison, laying both his hands on the young man’s\r\nshoulders, looked into his eyes and said:\r\n\r\n“Stasch, tell me. Is there any one in the world but you to whom I could\r\ntrust her so well?”\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThe young Tarkowski couple remained in England till the death of Mr.\r\nRawlison. A year later they started on a long journey. They had promised\r\nthemselves the pleasure of revisiting the places where they had spent\r\ntheir childhood and had wandered as youngsters, so they first went to\r\nEgypt. The kingdom of the Mahdi and Abdullah had long since\r\ndisintegrated, and after its ruin there came, as Captain Glen had said,\r\n“England.” A railroad had been built from Cairo to Khartum. The places\r\nwhich used to be overflowed by the Nile had been cleaned up, so that the\r\nyoung couple were able to travel in a comfortable steamer not only as\r\nfar as Fashoda, but even to the large Victoria-Nyanza Lake. From the\r\ntown of Florence, which lay on the banks of this lake, they took the\r\ntrain to Mombasa. Captain Glen and Dr. Clary had moved to Natal, but\r\nunder the good care of the English officials in Mombasa lived—King. The\r\ngiant immediately recognized his former masters, and he welcomed Nell\r\nwith such joyous trumpeting that the neighboring mangrove trees shook as\r\nthough before a wind. He also knew old Saba, who had lived to almost\r\ntwice the age allotted to dogs, and, though half blind now, accompanied\r\nStasch and Nell wherever they went.\r\n\r\nStasch also learned while there that Kali was doing well, that he ruled\r\nunder English protection over the whole territory south of Rudolf Lake,\r\nand that he had invited missionaries to come into his land to preach\r\nChristianity among the savage natives.\r\n\r\nAfter completing this final long journey the young couple returned to\r\nEurope, and taking Stasch’s father with them, they made their permanent\r\nresidence in Poland.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\nAbdullah’s reign lasted ten years longer. The fatal stroke was given to\r\nthe Dervishes by Lord Kitchener, who, in a bloody battle, nearly\r\nannihilated them, and razed the tomb of the Mahdi to the ground.\r\n\r\n                 PRINTED BY BENZIGER BROTHERS, NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TRANSCRIBER NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nMis-spelled words and printer errors have been fixed.\r\n\r\nInconsistency in hyphenation has been retained.\r\n\r\nInconsistency in accents has been fixed.\r\n\r\nMoved the illustrations to the associated text, and removed the page\r\nnumber references from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Through the Desert, by Henryk Sienkiewicz",
