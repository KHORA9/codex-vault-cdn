I.  PHILADELPHIA, _Sixth Month, 1820._   _No. 6._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE DESULTORY REMARKER.\r\n\r\nNo. V.\r\n\r\n    This mournful truth is every where confess'd,\r\n    _Slow rises worth, by poverty depress'd._\r\n\r\n  Dr. Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous and important are the boasted advantages of our free\r\ngovernment. Men and things are professedly estimated, in this\r\nregion of sturdy republicanism, in exact accordance with their true\r\ncharacter. Our just and beautiful theories inculcate the doctrine,\r\nthat VIRTUE and TALENT are the only proper grounds of distinction\r\nin society; and if this were faithfully illustrated in practice,\r\nmerit would not be opposed by serious obstacles, in emerging from\r\nobscurity. If such a desirable state of things were realized,\r\nhow rapidly would our country advance in prosperity! Monarchical\r\ninstitutions, which sanction the hereditary descent of RANK and\r\nDISTINCTION, would contrast very unpleasantly with those which are\r\nbottomed on the cardinal principle, that all men are by NATURE\r\nCREATED EQUAL. It becomes us therefore to inquire, whether the\r\nfancied superiority, which in relation to this subject, we arrogate\r\nto ourselves, be in reality any thing but in name.\r\n\r\nIn prosecuting this inquiry, let personal observation, and\r\npersonal experience, be candidly consulted. If we have voluntarily\r\nsubstituted, for what in other countries results from the exercise\r\nof despotic power, an idol of our own creation, and bow to it with\r\nthe same deference and fealty, what becomes of our claim to the\r\ntitle of independence? The effect of such a deception will be no\r\nless productive of mental and moral degradation, than if the laws\r\nof the land had authorized the establishment of PRIVILEGED ORDERS.\r\nThe real republican character is particularly distinguished by its\r\nsimplicity. The inroads of luxury, and the inordinate influence of\r\nwealth, are anxiously to be deprecated, as destructive to rational\r\nliberty. Titles of nobility are not within our reach; but the\r\nglitter of wealth may equally awaken our ambition, and monopolize\r\nour attention. Here there is danger, against the approach of which\r\nit is the part of prudence and of wisdom to be vigilant.\r\n\r\nWhen an individual is supposed to be affluent, have we ever known\r\nhis merit to be unjustly overlooked or disregarded? Are not riches\r\nuniformly invested with the magic power of extenuating the faults,\r\nand magnifying the good qualities of their possessor? The answers\r\nto these questions will at once be given without hesitation,\r\n\r\n    For virtue, glory, beauty, all divine\r\n    And human powers, immortal Gold! are thine.\r\n\r\nThe complexion of society in Philadelphia, is considered, in many\r\nrespects, of that chastened and respectable character, which is well\r\nbecoming the nature of our institutions. Our metropolis has always\r\nbeen distinguished for _Benevolence_, of which, as well as of other\r\ngood qualities, honourable mention might be made. But indiscriminate\r\napprobation must be withheld, if we maintain our allegiance to\r\ntruth. There is in this city an aristocracy of wealth, which has a\r\nwithering and destructive effect on the best interests of social\r\nlife.--Wealth, in certain circles, is considered an indispensable\r\nrecommendation; and perhaps in some instances, the only one its\r\npossessor is required to prefer! It is not pretended, that this\r\ngolden qualification should be contemned in the abstract; for,\r\nwhen not abused, it furnishes the means not only of procuring many\r\nvaluable and rational gratifications, but of extensive utility to\r\nothers. But we err egregiously, in permitting it to supplant, in our\r\nestimation, the only distinctions of real value;--those which have\r\nbeen indicated above. Such a blind devotion to its charms, casts\r\na reflection upon our character for good sense, equally just and\r\nsevere with that which properly belongs to a retailer of the stale\r\nand pointless bon-mots of monarchs, for wit, merely because they\r\nissue from the fountain of royalty. This slavish subserviency, is\r\naltogether unworthy of freemen; they must, if true to themselves,\r\ndiscard the influence of PRIVILEGED ORDERS, and view things as they\r\nreally are.--Many an individual, who now fills a large space in the\r\npublic eye, would, if overtaken by adversity, scarcely be discerned\r\nat all without the aid of a microscope. He would, when deserted by\r\nprosperity, return to his native insignificance, and assume his\r\nproper station in life.\r\n\r\nOur conduct to all men should be friendly and decorous, but to those\r\nwho are struggling with adverse circumstances, and who possess\r\nsterling recommendations to our notice, it should be zealously\r\nand liberally extended. The great man, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor our motto, knew what it was to be beset by those potent\r\nadversaries,--griping poverty, and chilling neglect. He concluded\r\none of his letters to CAVE, the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine,\r\nin these remarkable words, \"I am yours IMPRANSUS.\" If by this he\r\nintended to convey the idea, that he was fasting because he had\r\nnot the means of procuring a dinner, what a melancholy reflection\r\ndoes it suggest to the mind. Even Lord CHESTERFIELD himself, whose\r\ndelicate nerves were so dreadfully shocked by the \"_savageness_\"\r\nof JOHNSON, had he been acquainted with the circumstance, and\r\nforeseen his future celebrity, would have hastened to his relief.\r\nWho that beheld Dr. FRANKLIN, in the garb of a printer's boy,\r\nwalking up Market Street, eating one of his rolls of bread, and\r\ncarrying the other under his arm, could have believed, that at a\r\nfuture period he would become one of the most celebrated men of the\r\nage. So deceptive are external appearances, and so irresistible\r\nmust be the conclusion, that VIRTUE and TALENT are not excluded\r\nfrom the humblest walks of life.--Hence the folly and injustice of\r\nestablishing PRIVILEGED ORDERS.\r\n\r\nSo long ago as the days of HORACE, the seductive power of gold\r\nwas considered as directly hostile to the cause of virtue. The\r\nfollowing lines are extracted from his ode to his friend SALLUST, as\r\ntranslated by Dr. FRANCIS.\r\n\r\n    Virtue, to crowds a foe profest,\r\n    Disdains to number with the blest,\r\n    Phraates, by his slaves ador'd,\r\n    And to the Parthian crown restor'd,\r\n    And gives the diadem, the throne,\r\n    And laurel wreath, to him alone,\r\n    _Who can a treasur'd mass of gold\r\n    With firm, undazzled eye behold!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was finely remarked by an Indian, that the white man has not so\r\ndeep and intimate a sense of his dependence upon God as the Indian.\r\nHe owes more, apparently, to himself and his fellows. Entrenched\r\nin his palaces of stone, he can smile at the pitiless storm, and\r\ndefy the blasts of winter. The great business of his early life, is\r\nto provide against its decline. He has artisans to administer to\r\nevery want, and to alleviate every pain. Hence his own importance is\r\nmagnified in his view; and he thinks less frequently of the great\r\nBeing, from whom all his comforts spring. The Indian, on the other\r\nhand, leads a life of privation and adventure. He wanders alone\r\nthrough the forest; and seeks companionship and communion with\r\nnature. He looks abroad on the majesty of creation, and feels that\r\nthere must be a Deity. In the uncertainty of his supplies of food,\r\nhe knows that he is at the mercy of an invisible Protector; and the\r\nfeeling of gratitude for unexpected relief, is more vivid than can\r\nenter into the heart of the civilized man.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to inquire into the justice of the Indian's\r\nremark, I shall go on to observe, that there is a like difference\r\nbetween the occupations of the city and country. Every thing in a\r\ngreat metropolis is artificial. As the division of labour is the\r\ngreat secret of national wealth, so it is carried to its greatest\r\nextent in the capital. The members of the community are there more\r\ninterlocked with each other, more helpless by themselves, than\r\nis the case with us. Accordingly they look to each other for the\r\nprincipal part of their enjoyments. To begin with the most necessary\r\nthings of life, a citizen is dependant upon a dozen tradesmen,\r\nperhaps, for those articles of food and clothing, which a farmer\r\nworks up at home. He accomplishes himself for one object of pursuit;\r\nand although profoundly ignorant of all others, is enabled thereby\r\nto fill his station, to keep his place as a key-stone in the arch of\r\nsociety. It never occurs to him how helpless and impotent he would\r\nbe by himself. He is accommodated to things around--the artificial\r\ncreature of an artificial system. Nor is it only in this dependence\r\nupon his fellows, that, the citizen differs from the countryman.\r\nHis contrivances against the unavoidable evils and calamities of\r\nlife, are more numerous, and cast a veil, in some degree, between\r\nhim and his Creator. The overruling of that hand, which dispenses\r\nand withholds the rain and the harvest, affect him, as it were, but\r\nat a distance.--His merchandise is the product of art. His system\r\nof credit equalizes, if I may use the expression, the dispensations\r\nof Providence. The tempest may bury his wealth in the bosom of the\r\ndeep; but an insurance office repairs the ravage of the elements.\r\nEvery means in his power is used to thwart the original decree, \"By\r\nthe sweat of thy brow,\" &c.--He looks into futurity, and calculates\r\nthe unfruitfulness of the seasons--not as a motive to humble\r\ndependence--not as an incentive to prayer and repentance--but that\r\nhe may build his fortune upon the wants and the casualties of his\r\nfellow creatures. He even grapples with death itself--calculates\r\nwith unfeeling selfishness the days and the infirmities of his\r\nneighbours, and wagers upon the length of his life. All his\r\narrangements are predicated upon this artificial system. The\r\nthought, if it ever occur to him, of the great God of nature, is as\r\nmuch shut out by it, as the fair face of creation from the alleys\r\nand courts of the city. And in proportion as he becomes impressed\r\nwith a deep sense of that overruling Providence, will these things\r\nbecome hateful in his eyes. No doubt the mind is, as Milton has it,\r\n\"its own place,\" and can transform the natural aliment of vice into\r\na medicament of virtue. The noblest examples of active goodness are\r\ngenerally to be found in a large metropolis; for it must be virtue\r\nof a superior cast that can resist the temptations which are there\r\npresented.--But minds of a contemplative turn may be allowed to shun\r\nthe combat which they find it so hard to sustain, and to seek for\r\naids to their good resolutions in external circumstances.\r\n\r\nTo all such I may venture to recommend the pursuits of a country\r\nlife as eminently salutary. Every month and week has there its\r\nappropriate labours, which cannot be neglected; and it is from\r\nthis cause a life of activity and variety. The events of the\r\nseason are full of interest, and it is peculiarly delightful to\r\nobserve how Providence still delights to bless. Shortsighted and\r\npresumptuous that we are, we are constantly auguring this or that\r\nmisfortune--lamenting the unpropitiousness in some respect or\r\nanother of the year; and yet from harvest to harvest are our barns\r\nfilled, and our granaries laden. The labours of the country do\r\nnot, like those of the city, deform the body, and undermine the\r\nconstitution; and there is in its clear atmosphere, and silent\r\nserenity, an influence as invigorating to the soul as the touch of\r\nearth to Antæus. In the country, the silent and manifest workings\r\nof the Deity are constantly before us, and meet our eyes in every\r\nphase of organized life: The mind must be worse than insensible that\r\ndoes not feel and respond to the voice of praise, which seems to be\r\nconstantly ascending, as from one great altar.\r\n\r\nSome philosophers have placed virtue in a state of lofty\r\ncontemplation; and others, of continued activity. The truth seems\r\nto be, that they are both essential to the perfect character.--He\r\nwho gives himself up to indolent meditation, will become a prey to\r\nthe enemies of his own household, and will fall by a servile foe. He\r\nwho never retires to \"plume his feathers, and let grow his wings,\"\r\nwill find himself less and less able to sustain his flight; and\r\ndiscover, perhaps, when it is too late, that he has lost the energy\r\nof virtue, and the love of moral beauty.\r\n\r\nBut as the temptations of the more selfish passions are the\r\nstrongest, that state of society in which we are the most exposed\r\nto them, is the most dangerous; and we have more need of having\r\nour eyes and our hearts fixed upon pure and lofty objects, than of\r\nhaving excessive stimulants applied to that activity, of which every\r\ncondition in life requires a steady and vigorous application. To\r\nreflecting minds, therefore, the labour and the relaxation which\r\nthe country holds out, are both more salutary and invigorating,\r\nthan that which is required amid the smoke, and bustle, and jarring\r\ninterests of a great metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT\r\n\r\n_Of the Agricultural School at Hofwyl, in Switzerland._\r\n\r\n(From the Edinburgh Review.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. de Fellenberg was first known merely as an agriculturist, and\r\nstill keeps up his original establishment of husbandry at Buchsie,\r\nan old chateau near Hofwyl; but agriculture was always with him\r\na secondary object, and subservient to that system of education\r\nto which his thoughts were very early directed. He is a man of an\r\nunusually ardent as well as persevering turn of mind, and conceals a\r\ncharacter of deep and steady enthusiasm, under a very calm exterior\r\nand manners. Although born to patrician rank in his own country, he\r\nearly imbibed those political doctrines of which such tremendous\r\nmisapplication was so soon to be made in his neighbourhood: and\r\nthe disappointment filled his mind with melancholy views of the\r\nmoral state and future prospects of mankind. It appeared to him,\r\nthat the world was blindly hurrying on to irretrievable ruin; and\r\nthat a sounder system of education for the great body of the people,\r\ncould alone stop the progress of error and corruption. He has\r\nsometimes mentioned in conversation the particular circumstances,\r\nwhich finally determined him to the course he has since pursued.\r\nIn the year 1798 or 1799, he happened to be at Paris as one of\r\nthe commission sent by the provisional government established in\r\nSwitzerland after the French invasion; and in that capacity he\r\nhad an official conversation with the Director Reubel, at his\r\ncountry-house near Paris,--in the course of which he laid before\r\nhim, in glowing colours, a picture of the miserable state to which\r\nhis country was reduced, and which might soon lead to a _Vendean_\r\nwar, destructive to both parties. The Director appeared for some\r\ntime to listen with profound attention, and Mr. de Fellenberg\r\nascribed his silence to conviction of the truths he urged, and\r\nsomething like a feeling of compunction,--when, all at once, the\r\nworthy republican throwing open a window, called aloud to one of his\r\nservants--'_Jacques! apportez moi Finette!_' A little spaniel was\r\nbrought accordingly with its litter of young ones in a basket--and\r\nthere was no chance of his hearing another word about Switzerland\r\nor liberty! After this rebuff, he gave up the idea of serving his\r\ncountry as a politician; and, asking for his passport the next day,\r\nmade the best of his way home, determined to set about the slow work\r\nof elementary reformation, by a better mode of education, and to\r\npersevere in it for the rest of his life!\r\n\r\nIt is now upwards of twelve years since Mr. de Fellenberg undertook\r\nto systematize domestic education, and to show on a large scale\r\nhow the children of the poor might be best taught, and their labour\r\nat the same time most profitably applied: in short, how the first\r\ntwenty years of a poor man's life might be so employed as to provide\r\nfor his support and his education. The peasants in his neighbourhood\r\nwere at first rather shy of trusting their children for a new\r\nexperiment; and being thus obliged to take his pupils where he\r\ncould find them, many of the earliest were the sons of vagrants,\r\nand literally picked up on the highways; and this is the case with\r\none or two of the most distinguished. He had very soon, however,\r\nthe good fortune of finding an excellent co-operator in the person\r\nof a young man of the name of Vehrli, the son of a schoolmaster of\r\nThurgovia, who, coming to Hofwyl in 1809, to see the establishment\r\nand inform himself of the mode of teaching, was so struck with the\r\nplan of the _school of industry_, that he offered his son, then\r\nabout 18, as an assistant. This young man devoted himself from that\r\nmoment to the undertaking.----Although admitted at first to Mr. de\r\nFellenberg's table, he soon left it for that of his pupils, with\r\nwhom he has ever since lived night and day. Working with them in\r\nthe fields, their playfellow in their hours of relaxation,--and,\r\nlearning himself what he is to teach as a master, his zeal has not\r\ncooled a moment during a trial of more than ten years' unremitting\r\nexertions, under the guidance of his patron, and assisted now\r\nby four other masters. The number of his pupils has increased\r\nsuccessively to 43: They obey him as well as Mr. de Fellenberg,\r\nentirely from love and a sense of duty:--punishment has been\r\ninflicted only twice since the beginning; and their treatment is\r\nnearly that of children under the paternal roof. They go out every\r\nmorning to their work soon after sunrise--having first breakfasted\r\nand received a lesson of about half an hour. They return at noon.\r\nDinner takes them half an hour,--a lesson of one hour follows; then\r\nto work again till six in the evening. On Sunday, the different\r\nlessons take six hours instead of two; and they have butcher's meat\r\non that day only. They are divided into three classes, according to\r\nage and strength; an entry is made in a book, every night, of the\r\nnumber of hours each class has worked, specifying the sort of labour\r\ndone, in order that it may be charged to the proper account, each\r\nparticular crop having an account opened for it, as well as every\r\nnew building, the live stock, the machines, the schools themselves,\r\n&c. &c. In winter, and whenever there is no out-of-doors' work,\r\nthe boys plait straw for chairs; make baskets; saw logs with the\r\ncross saw, and split them; thrash and winnow corn, grind colours,\r\nknit stockings, or assist the wheel-wright and other artificers, of\r\nwhom there are many employed on the establishment. For all which\r\ndifferent sorts of labour an adequate salary is credited each boy's\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nMr. de Fellenberg indeed observes, that the boys being most of them\r\nonly just come to the age of productive labour, it is presumed the\r\nEstablishment will not only support itself in future, but repay\r\npast expenses; particularly as certain outfits charged to the first\r\nyears will not recur again.--He observes also, that several grown\r\nboys have been suffered to go away, and have been replaced by young\r\nchildren, to the great injury of the Establishment. It may be added,\r\nthat the pupils have been indulged of late with better clothes than\r\nformerly, or than is strictly necessary, as well as a better table;\r\nand that, from attention to their feelings, the cast-off clothes\r\nof the _school of the rich_ are not turned to their use, but given\r\naway to the poor of the neighbourhood, that they may not appear in\r\nthe light of dependants on any but their adoptive father and their\r\nown labour. It is undoubtedly a very striking circumstance, that\r\nonly one, out of the whole number of boys admitted into this school\r\nsince the beginning, has been dismissed as irrecoverably vicious;\r\nall the others have got rid of their former habits;--and, when final\r\nsentence was passed upon the unfortunate boy, the others begged\r\nleave to contribute each one _batz_ towards a present to him, that\r\nhe might remember them with kindness.\r\n\r\nThe labours of the field, their various sports, their lessons, their\r\nchoral songs, the necessary rest, fill the whole circle of the\r\ntwenty-four hours; and judging from their open, cheerful, contented\r\ncountenances, nothing seems wanting to their happiness.--But it is\r\na great point gained, to have brought young men to the age of 18\r\nor 20, uncontaminated by the general licentiousness which prevails\r\nin the country. When their time is out, and they mix with other\r\npeople, they will no doubt marry; but the probability is, they will\r\nbe more difficult in their choice than other men of the same rank,\r\nand will shrink from vulgarity and abject poverty. Long habits of\r\nself-restraint, too, will enable them to look out with comparative\r\npatience for a suitable establishment, before they burden themselves\r\nwith a family. In short, if the only check of the mild kind to an\r\nexcessive increase of population is self-restraint, from motives of\r\nprudence and morality, where may we look for it with better hopes\r\nthan among the pupils of Mr. de Fellenberg?\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed, however, to lay before our readers a more\r\ndetailed account of the internal management of the school of\r\nindustry. The lessons are given mostly _viva voce_, and various\r\nquestions continually interposed, respecting measures of capacity,\r\nlength and weight, and their fractional parts; the cubic contents\r\nof a piece of timber, or a stack of hay; the time necessary to\r\nperform any particular task, under such or such circumstances; the\r\neffects of gravitation; the laws of mechanics; rules of grammar and\r\ndifferent parts of speech, &c. &c. The boys endeavour to find the\r\nsolution of arithmetical and mathematical problems without writing,\r\nand at the same time to proceed with the mechanical processes in\r\nwhich they may happen to be engaged. Aware of the difficulties with\r\nwhich they are thus made to grapple, as it were, without assistance,\r\nthey are the more sensible of the value of those scientific short\r\ncuts, which carry you in the dark indeed, but safely and speedily,\r\nto your journey's end, and the more delighted with their beauty\r\nas well as their use. They acquire the _rationale_ of the thing,\r\ntogether with the practice; their understandings are exercised,\r\nand their attention kept awake. None of them are ever seen to look\r\ninattentive or tired, although just returned from their day's\r\nlabour in the fields. Contrivance, and some degree of difficulty to\r\novercome, is a necessary condition, it would seem, of our enjoyments.\r\n\r\nThe pupils are not always questioned, but, in their turn, propose\r\nquestions to the masters, and difficulties to be solved, which\r\nthey do sometimes with considerable ingenuity.--They draw outlines\r\nof maps, from memory, exhibiting the principal towns, rivers,\r\nand chains of mountains; they draw correctly from nature, and in\r\nperspective, all sorts of machines for agriculture; and are very\r\nfond of trying chymically the different sorts of soil, and have\r\ntables of them very well arranged.\r\n\r\nVarious gymnastic games are also practised occasionally; but mental\r\nexercises find their place better after hard labour: They do indeed\r\nin the fields full as well as on the benches of the school. For\r\ninstance, when the boys are employed in digging trenches to irrigate\r\na meadow, and while directing the water along artificial ridges,\r\nand round hills, so as to regulate the fall and distribute the\r\nmoisture equally, they put each other in mind of what they have\r\nheard about the laws of hydraulics. When they clear a field of the\r\nstones turned up by the plough, and are directed to separate those\r\nwhich are calcareous, in order to be burned into lime, they know and\r\npractise the different tests by which their nature is ascertained,\r\nand can point out in the horizon, the particular mountains which\r\nhave furnished these various fragments.\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage the attachment to property acquired by our own\r\nindustry, the pupils are allowed certain emoluments, such as the\r\nproceeds of the seeds they collect, some part of their gleanings,\r\nand what they raise in a small garden of their own; all which\r\naccumulates, and forms a fund for the time of their going away. No\r\nambitious views are fostered by this mode of training the poorest\r\nclass, beyond that of being good husbandmen. The pupils of the\r\n_school of industry_ are not raised above their station; but their\r\nstation, dignified and improved, is raised to them. It has been\r\nremarked before, that men born in the poorest class of society,\r\nconstituted as it is at present, especially those who subsist in\r\npart on public charity, find it almost as difficult to get out of\r\ntheir dependant situation as a Hindoo to leave his cast,--kept\r\ndown as they are by a sort of inbred ignorance and improvidence,\r\nand, above all, by their multitude; which is one of the worst\r\nconsequences of that improvidence. The higher and middling ranks\r\nscarcely keep up their numbers any where; while multiplication goes\r\non, unrestrained by any consideration of prudence, precisely among\r\nthose who are least able to support a family. The poor may, in the\r\nbitterness of want, exclaim against taxes and ill government, and\r\ncertainly not always without reason;--but the worst government is\r\ntheir own of themselves.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural labour_ is not the only occupation which can be made\r\nthe base of such an education. _Manufactures_, with all their\r\ndisadvantages, might answer the purpose, provided the children were\r\nnot collected together in vast numbers in the same rooms--provided\r\nthey were under the care of intelligent and kind masters and\r\noverseers, and were allowed gardens of their own, and a certain\r\nnumber of hours each day to work in them, or take exercise in the\r\nopen air--all which must abridge necessarily the time allotted to\r\nproductive labour, or to learning. One of the great advantages of\r\nhusbandry is, that it affords sufficient exercise, and leaves more\r\ntime for mental improvement. Such of Vehrli's pupils as have a turn\r\nfor any of the trades in demand at Hofwyl--wheelwright, carpenter,\r\nsmith, &c. tailor or shoemaker--are allowed to apply to them. These\r\nboys will leave the Institution at the age of one-and-twenty,\r\nunderstanding agriculture better than any peasants ever did before,\r\nbesides being practically acquainted with a trade, and with a share\r\nof learning quite unprecedented among the same class of people; and\r\nyet as hard-working and abstemious as any of them, and with the\r\nbest moral habits and principles. It seems impossible to desire or\r\nimagine a better condition of the peasantry.\r\n\r\nPublic education, Mr. de Fellenberg observes, is too generally a\r\nuniform process, imposed indiscriminately, and by force, upon every\r\nvariety of disposition, talents, and character. His object, on the\r\nother hand, is to suit the education to the pupil, and not the\r\npupil to the education.--A good preceptor should be an experienced\r\nfriend, who guides,--not a master who commands, and, above all,\r\nnot an irascible master. Punishments and rewards he considers as\r\nequally objectionable: for fear makes slaves, and the love of\r\ndistinction unfolds, in the end, most of the bad passions. _Do as\r\nyou would be done by_ is, he maintains, the only safe rule of\r\nconduct to inculcate; a lively feeling of right and wrong, goodwill\r\nand kindness to all men, the only sentiments fit to be encouraged.\r\nEmulation, perhaps, is too powerful and universal a stimulant to be\r\naltogether excluded; but it needs more frequently to be repressed\r\nthan excited. Such a vigilant and cautious system of training would\r\nbe best carried on certainly under the parental roof, in a well\r\nregulated and united family; and therefore he wishes a school to\r\nresemble as nearly as possible such a family, and to be as unlike as\r\npossible to a mere manufactory of learning.\r\n\r\nThe whole course of studies may be considered as divided into three\r\nperiods, of three years each. In the first, they study Greek and the\r\nGrecian History, the knowledge of animals, plants, and minerals.\r\nIn the second, Latin, Roman History, and the Geography of the\r\nRoman world. And in the third, Modern Languages and Literature,\r\nModern History to the last century, and Geography--the Physical\r\nSciences, and Chymistry. During the whole nine years, they apply to\r\nMathematics, Drawing, Music, and Gymnastic Exercises.\r\n\r\nThe geometrical representation of near objects--the house, the\r\ngarden, the course of the river, the surrounding country, the\r\nmountains beyond it, taken by approximation in the shape of a\r\nmap--is the natural introduction to Geography. When the pupils feel\r\na curiosity to know more of the world than they can see, maps are\r\nthen laid before them, and the globe and its uses are explained.\r\nThey are made to delineate correctly, from memory, the shape of\r\ncontinents and seas; and to place and name the principal chains of\r\nmountains, the course of rivers, the boundaries of states, their\r\nprovinces and capitals;--and this leads to an inquiry into the\r\nparticular history of each, and their natural productions.\r\n\r\nDrawing is early cultivated, from natural objects first, then\r\nby copying, and finally by composing characteristic heads, or\r\nrather endeavouring to imitate the effect of passions on the\r\nhuman countenance. The execution is generally correct, but hard\r\nand dry--in the style of Perugino certainly, rather than of\r\nRembrandt. Music likewise is much practised; not however with a\r\nview to execution, but for the sake of the Poetry of music, and its\r\nPiety--as an elevated language, in which certain ideas and feelings\r\nare expressed, which no other human means can reach or convey. The\r\ngymnastic exercises have for their object, health, and the dexterous\r\nuse of the bodily faculties; but they never are exhibited in public,\r\nand made an occasion of show and display.\r\n\r\nIt is the endeavour of the master to encourage his pupils to express\r\nfreely, both in writing and conversation, the opinions and feelings\r\nwhich have been suggested by their reading; and thus to enable them\r\nto rectify their mistakes, either as to facts or inferences; never\r\ndictating to them what they should think, and yet restraining and\r\ndirecting the flights of a young imagination. The pupils do not\r\nread the history of the last century before their twentieth year,\r\nwhen judgment is sufficiently matured; and even then, all reference\r\nto the politics of the day is avoided, that they may enter the\r\nworld with minds wholly free from party spirit, and able to form\r\nunprejudiced opinions. Common newspapers and political pamphlets are\r\nnever seen at Hofwyl.\r\n\r\nThe study of Mathematics continues during the whole period of\r\neducation, to an extent determined entirely by the individual\r\ncapacity and disposition of each pupil, who is not hurried on or\r\nretarded for the sake of keeping pace with others. Every problem is\r\nanalyzed and explained thoroughly before passing to another. The\r\ninterest and attention of those of ordinary abilities, is kept up by\r\npractical applications of the science; and none but those properly\r\nqualified apply to the pure mathematics: In doing so, they are\r\ncarefully guarded against the pride of successful calculation, which\r\nis apt to overlook Divine power in the consideration of its own.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Mr. de Fellenberg dwells with delight and\r\nconfidence on the natural proofs of the existence of the Supreme\r\nBeing, he admits fully, and establishes the necessity of a\r\nRevelation to supply the insufficiency of human reason. Socrates\r\nhimself, he observes, did not know how to establish the dogma of the\r\nunity of God. His pupils, brought up in purity and simplicity of\r\nheart, under the influence of reason and kindness, are in a great\r\ndegree Christians before they are taught Christianity,--and best\r\nprepared, therefore, to understand and receive the Divine doctrine;\r\nbut all dogmatic points are reserved for the ministers of their\r\nrespective communions, who are to instruct them; and controversial\r\ndisputes are unknown and interdicted.\r\n\r\nIt has been said also that Mr. de Fellenberg's husbandry is ruinous.\r\nThis would only add to the wonder of his being able to do what he\r\ndoes by his own slender means; but, in point of fact, his farm\r\naffords a very considerable profit. We have, upon this point, the\r\nevidence of a gentleman well versed in those matters, Mr. Crud of\r\nGenthod, one of the commissioners appointed by the Swiss Diet to\r\ninquire into the agricultural establishment at Hofwyl, the result of\r\nwhose statements is, that the farm (214-1/2 poses, equal to about\r\n172 English acres) has produced _net_ in 4 years from 1810 to 1814,\r\n56,705_l._ Swiss money, and for one year 14,176_l._ which, deducting\r\ninterest at 6 per cent. on 14,382_l._ the average value of stock on\r\nthe farm, or 843_l._, leaves a clear profit of 13,313_l._, equal to\r\n3_l._ 17s. 6d. Sterling a pose (nearly equal to 4/5ths of an English\r\nacre;)[1] and, valuing the farm at the high price of 750_l._ a\r\npose, (47_l._ Sterling,) gives something more than 8-1/4 per cent.\r\ninterest, net of all charges. The farm is undoubtedly benefited by\r\nthe Institution, which affords a ready market for its produce, and\r\nperhaps by the low price at which the labour of Vehrli's boys is\r\ncharged: But the farm, on the other hand, affords regular employment\r\nto the boys; and also enables Mr. de Fellenberg to receive his\r\nricher pupils at a lower price than he could otherwise do. Hofwyl,\r\nin short, is a great whole; where 120 or 130 pupils, more than\r\n50 masters and professors, as many servants, and a number of\r\nday-labourers, six or eight families of artificers and tradesmen,\r\naltogether about 300 persons, find a plentiful, and in many respects\r\na luxurious subsistence, exclusive of education, out of the produce\r\nof 170 acres, and a money income of six or seven thousand pounds,\r\nreduced more than half by salaries, affords a very considerable\r\nsurplus to lay out in additional buildings.\r\n\r\n  [1] The pose is 40,000 square feet of Berne, equal to 32,500 of\r\n  Paris, and about 35,000 English feet, that is, equal to about 4/5ths\r\n  of an English acre.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with what we had ourselves learned and thought on\r\nthis subject, we have been anxious to learn what was thought of\r\nit in the neighbourhood, and by persons not particularly friendly\r\nto the Institution. We have scarcely heard an objection against\r\nthe _School of Industry_. The opinion is _universally_ favourable\r\nto it; and though there is more difference of sentiment as to the\r\n_higher school_, the worst we have heard is, that the pupils are\r\nnot so advanced in any one science as some young men brought up in\r\nother schools are. It is admitted that they are eminently moral and\r\namiable in their deportment; that they are very intelligent; and\r\nthat their ideas have a wide range. In short, the objection, as it\r\nappears to us, is, that they are likely to become liberal-minded\r\ngentlemen, but not professors. Hofwyl is not a college where\r\nthe only object is learning;--still less a monastery, where an\r\naustere and uniform rule prevails;--it is a little world, composed\r\nof different ranks and professions, and where individuality of\r\ncharacter is preserved, and a variety of talents unfolded.\r\n\r\nThe patricians of Berne have been generally, from the beginning,\r\nunfavourable to the Institution; yet several of them have their sons\r\nin it, and many more are now endeavouring to procure admittance.\r\nWe have learned very lately, that a decided and active enemy, many\r\nyears first magistrate of the district where Hofwyl is situated,\r\nand lately dead, enjoined expressly in his last-will, that his sons\r\nshould, if possible, be educated exclusively at Hofwyl!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatise on Agriculture._\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.\r\n\r\n     Of the Analysis of Soils, and of the agricultural relations\r\n     between soils and plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the earths have a threefold capacity; that they\r\nreceive and lodge the roots of plants and support their stems; that\r\nthey absorb and hold air, water and mucilage--aliments necessary to\r\nvegetable life; and that they even yield a portion of themselves to\r\nthese aliments. But we have also seen, that they are not equally\r\nadapted to these offices; that their parts, texture and qualities\r\nare different; that they are cold or warm, wet or dry, porous or\r\ncompact, barren or productive, in proportion as one or other may\r\npredominate in the soil; and that to fit them for discharging the\r\nvarious functions to which they are destined, each must contribute\r\nits share, and all be minutely divided and intimately mixed. In this\r\ngreat work nature has performed her part, but as is usual with her,\r\nshe has wisely and benevolently left something for man to do.\r\n\r\nThis necessary march of human industry, obviously begins by\r\nascertaining the _nature of the soil_. But neither the touch, nor\r\nthe eye, however practised or acute, can in all cases determine\r\nthis. _Clay_, when wet, is cold and tenacious--a description that\r\nbelongs also to magnesian earths: _sand_ and _gravel_ are hard\r\nand granular; but so also are some of the modifications of lime:\r\n_vegetable mould_ is black and friable, but not exclusively so; for\r\nschistous and carbonaceous earths have the same properties.\r\n\r\nIt is here, then, that chemistry offers herself to obviate\r\ndifficulties, and remove doubts; but neither the apparatus nor\r\nprocess of this science, are within the reach of all who are\r\ninterested in the inquiry, and we accordingly subjoin a method,\r\nless comprehensive, but more simple and sufficiently exact, for\r\nagricultural purposes, and which calls only for two vases, a pair of\r\nscales, clean water and a little sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n\"1st. Take a small quantity of earth from different parts of the\r\nfield, the soil of which you wish to ascertain, mix them well\r\ntogether and weigh them; put them in an oven, heated for baking\r\nbread, and after they are dried, weigh them again; the difference\r\nwill show the _absorbent power of the earth_. When the loss of\r\nweight in 400 grains, amounts to 50, this power is great, and\r\nindicates the presence of much animal or vegetable matter; but when\r\nit does not exceed twenty, the absorbent power is small, and the\r\nvegetable matter deficient.[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] See Davy's Elements.\r\n\r\n\"2d. Put the dried mass into a vase with one fourth of its own\r\nweight of clear water; mix them well together: pour off the dirty\r\nwater into a second vase, and pour on as much clean water as before;\r\nstir the contents, and continue this process until the water poured\r\noff, is as clear as that poured on the earth. What remains in the\r\nfirst employed vase is _sand_, _silicious_ or _calcareous_.\r\n\r\n\"3d. The dirty water, collected in the second vase, will form a\r\ndeposit, which (after pouring off the wa-ter) must be dried,\r\nweighed and _calcined_. On weighing it _after_ this process, the\r\nquantity lost will show the portion of _animal_ and _vegetable mould\r\ncontained in the soil_; and,\r\n\r\n\"4th. This calcined matter must then be carefully pulverised and\r\nweighed, as also the first deposit of sand, but without mixing\r\nthem. To these, apply (separately) sulphuric acid, and what they\r\nrespectively lose in weight, is the portion of _calcareous_ or\r\n_aluminous earths_ contained in them. These last may be separated\r\nfrom the mass by soap lie, which dissolves them.\"[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] This manner of analysing soils is that described by M. Rose,\r\n  member of the institute of France, &c. and recommended to French\r\n  agriculturists.\r\n\r\nHere is the light we wanted. In knowing the disease, we find the\r\ncure. Clay and sand qualify each other; either of these will\r\ncorrect an excess of lime; and magnesian earth, when saturated with\r\n_carbonic acid_, becomes fertile.\r\n\r\nBut entirely to alter the constitution of a soil, whether by\r\nmechanical or other means, is a work of time, labour and expense,\r\nand little adapted to the pecuniary circumstances of farmers in\r\ngeneral. Fortunately, a remedy, cheaper, more accessible and\r\nless difficult, is found in that _great diversity_ of habits and\r\ncharacter, which mark the vegetable races. We shall, therefore, in\r\nwhat remains of this section, indicate the principal of these, as\r\nfurnishing the basis of all rational agriculture.\r\n\r\n1st. _Plants have different systems of roots, stems and leaves,\r\nand adapt themselves accordingly to different kinds of soils:_\r\nthe Tussilago prefers clay, the Spergula sand; Asparagus will\r\nnot flourish on a bed of granite nor Musus Islandicus on one of\r\nalluvion. It is obvious, that _fibrous rooted_ plants, which occupy\r\nonly the surface of the earth, can subsist on comparatively stiff\r\nand compact soils in which those of the leguminous and cruciform\r\nfamilies would perish, from inability to penetrate and divide.\r\n\r\n2d. _Plans of the same, or of a similar kind, do not follow each\r\nother advantageously in the same soil._ Every careful observer must\r\nhave seen how grasses alternate in meadows or pastures, where nature\r\nis left to herself. At one time, timothy, at another clover, at a\r\nthird red-top, and at a fourth blue grass prevails. The same remark\r\napplies to forest trees; the original growth of wood, is rarely\r\nsucceeded by a second of the same kind; pine is followed by oak, oak\r\nby chesnut, chesnut by hickory. A young apple tree will not live\r\nin a place where an old one has died; even the pear tree does not\r\nthrive in succession to an apple tree, but stone fruit will follow\r\neither with advantage. \"In the Gautinois (says Bosc,) saffron is not\r\nresumed but after a lapse of twenty years; and in the Netherlands,\r\nflax and colzat require an interval of six years. Peas, when they\r\nfollow beans, give a lighter crop than when they succeed plants of\r\nanother family.\"[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] The ill effect of a succession of crops of the same kind was\r\n  not unknown to the Romans. We have proof of this in the following\r\n  passage of Festus: \"Resistilibus ager fit qui continuo biennio\r\n  seseritur farreo spico id est aristato, quad ne fiat _solent, qui\r\n  pradia locant, excipere_.\"\r\n\r\n3d. _Vegetables, whether of the name family or not, having a similar\r\nstructure of roots, should not succeed each other._ It has been\r\nobserved, that trees suffer considerably by the neighbourhood of\r\nsainfoin and lucern, on account of the great depth to which the\r\nroots of these plants penetrate--whereas culmiferous grasses do them\r\nno harm.\r\n\r\n4th. _Annual or biennial trefoils, prevent the escape of moisture by\r\nevaporation, or filtration, from sandy and arid soils_, and should\r\nconstantly cover them in the absence of other plants;[5] while\r\n_drying and dividing crops_, as beans, cabbages, chickory, &c. &c.\r\n_are best fitted to correct the faults of stiff and wet clays_.\r\n\r\n  [5] The \"Sterilis tellus medio versatur in æstu\" of Virgil, shows\r\n  the opinion he entertained of a husbandry that left the fields\r\n  without vegetation.\r\n\r\n5th. _When plants, are cultivated in rows or hills, and the ground\r\nbetween them is thoroughly worked, the earth is kept open, divided\r\nand permeable to air, heat and water, and accordingly receives from\r\nthe atmosphere nearly as much alimentary provision as it gives to\r\nthe plant._ This principle is the basis of the drill husbandry.\r\n\r\n6th. _All plants permitted to go through the phases of vegetation\r\n(and of course to give their seeds) exhaust the ground in a greater\r\nor less degree; but if cut green, and before seeding, they take\r\nlittle from the principle of fertility._\r\n\r\n7th. _Plants are exhausters in proportion to the length of time\r\nthey occupy the soil._ Those of the culmiferous kinds (wheat, rye,\r\n&c.) do not ripen under ten months, and during this period, forbid\r\nthe earth from being stirred: while, on the other hand, leguminous\r\nplants occupy it but six months, and permit frequent ploughings.\r\nThis is one reason why culmiferous crops are greater exhausters than\r\nleguminous; another is, that the stems of culmiferous plants become\r\nhard and flinty, and their leaves dry and yellow, from the time of\r\nflowering till the ripening of the seed--losing their inhaling or\r\nabsorbing faculties--circulating no juices, and living altogether\r\nin their roots, and on aliments exclusively derived from the earth,\r\nwhereas leguminous or cruciferous plants, as cabbages, turnips, &c.\r\n&c. have succulent stems, and broad and porous leaves, and draw\r\ntheir principal nourishment from the atmosphere. The remains of\r\nculmiferous crops, also are fewer, and less easily decomposed, than\r\nthose of the leguminous family.\r\n\r\n8th. _Meadows, natural and artificial, yield the food necessary to\r\ncattle, and, in proportion as these are multiplied, manures are\r\nincreased and the soil made better._ Another circumstance that\r\nrecommends them is, that so long as they last, they exact but little\r\nlabour, and leave the whole force of the farmer to be directed to\r\nhis arable grounds.[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] The good effect of these mixtures was known to the ancients,\r\n  from whom the practice has descended to us.\r\n\r\n9th. _Grasses are either fibrous or tap-rooted, or both. The remarks\r\nalready made in articles 1, 2 and 3, apply also to them._ Timothy,\r\nred-top, oat-grass and rye-grass, succeed best in stiff, wet soils.\r\nSainfoin does well on soils the most bare, mountainous and arid;\r\nlucern and the trefoils, (or clovers,) only attain the perfection of\r\nwhich they are susceptible, in warm, dry, calcareous earth.\r\n\r\n10th. _The ameliorating quality of tap-rooted plants is supposed\r\nto be in proportion to their natural duration_; annual clover,\r\n(lupinella) has less of this property than biennial, (Dutch clover,)\r\nbiennial less than sainfoin, and sainfoin less than lucern.\r\n\r\n11th. _Any green crop, ploughed into the soil, has an effect highly\r\nimproving_; but for this purpose, lupins and buckwheat (cut when in\r\nflower) are most proper.\r\n\r\n12. _Mixed crops_ (as Indian corn, pumpkins, and peas and oats,)\r\n_are much and profitably employed_, and _with less injury to the\r\nsoil than either corn or oats alone_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nOf Practical Agriculture, and its necessary Instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe begin this part of our subject with a few remarks on the\r\ninstruments necessary to agriculture, which may be comprised under\r\nthe well known names of the plough, the harrow, the roller, the\r\nthreshing-machine, and the fanning mill.\r\n\r\nI. Of the plough:\r\n\r\nIt is among the inscrutable dispensations of Providence, that the\r\narts most useful to man, have been of later discovery--of slower\r\ngrowth, and of less marked improvement, than those that aimed only\r\nat his destruction.--At a time, when the phalanx and the legions\r\nwere invented and perfected, and when the instruments they employed\r\nwere various and powerful, those of agriculture continued to be few,\r\nand simple, and inefficient.\r\n\r\nOf the Greek plough, we know nothing; and the general disuse of that\r\ndescribed by Virgil and Pliny, furnishes a degree of evidence, that\r\nexperience has found it incompetent to its objects.--With even the\r\nboasted lights of modern knowledge, scientific men are not agreed\r\nupon the form and proportion, most proper for this instrument. As\r\nin other cases, so in this, there may be no _abstract perfection_;\r\nwhat is best in one description of soil, may not be so in another;\r\nyet, as in all soils, the office of the plough is the same, viz.\r\nto _cleave_ and _turn over the earth_, there cannot but be some\r\ndefinite shape and proportions, better fitted for these purposes,\r\nand at the same time less susceptible of resistance, than any other.\r\n\r\nThis beau ideal, this suppositious excellence, in the mechanism of a\r\nplough, has been the object of great national, as well as individual\r\nresearch. In Great Britain, high prizes have been established for\r\nits attainment; and in France, under the ministry of Chaptal,\r\n10,000 francs, or $2000, were offered for this object, by the\r\nagricultural society of the Seine. In both countries, the subject\r\nhas employed many able pens; those of Lord Kaimes, of Mr. Young,\r\nof Mr. Arbuthnot, of Lord Somerville, and of Messieurs Duhamel,\r\nChateauvieux, Bosc, Guillaume, &c. It is not for us, therefore, to\r\ndo more than assemble and present such rules for the construction of\r\nthis instrument, as have most attained the authority of maxims.\r\n\r\n1st. The beam, or that part of the plough which carries the\r\ncoulter, and furnishes the point of draft, should be as near that\r\nof resistance as possible; because the more these are approached,\r\nthe less is the moving power required. Even the shape of the beam is\r\nnot a matter of indifference. In the old ploughs, it was generally\r\nstraight, but a small curve is now preferred; because it has the\r\neffect of strengthening the coulter, by shortening it.\r\n\r\n2d. The _head_ of the plough, is the plain on which it moves.\r\nThis should be concave, because that form offers fewer points of\r\nfriction, and, of course, less resistance. Between the beam and the\r\nhead, is an angle, on which depends the principal office of the\r\nplough; the making, at will, a deep or a shallow furrow. If you wish\r\na deep furrow, diminish the angle, and vice versa: but this angle\r\nshould, in no case, exceed from 18 to 24 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe resistance made to the plough being produced less by the weight\r\nof the earth, than by the cohesion of its parts, it is evident,\r\nthat the head should be shod with iron, and rendered as smooth as\r\npossible. This remark applies equally to the soc and to the mould\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n3d. The soc, in its widest part, should be larger than the head.\r\nIt has different shapes in different countries. In some is given\r\nto it that of an isosceles triangle; in others, that of the head\r\nof a lance; in Biscay, that of a crescent; and in Poland, of a two\r\npronged fork. But, whatever be its shape, it should be well pointed\r\nand polished--enter the earth with facility, and cut it easily.\r\n\r\n4th. To the _mould board_, some workmen give the shape of a\r\nprismatic wedge; others make the upper part convex, and the lower\r\nconcave; while many make it entirely flat. In stiff soils, the _semi\r\ncycloid_ is the form to be preferred, and in loose friable soils\r\nthe _semi-ellipsis_.[7] The iron mould boards have great advantages\r\nover the wooden, particularly when they, the shear and the soc, form\r\none piece, as in the plough of Mr. Cook.\r\n\r\n  [7] See Arbuthnot on Ploughs.\r\n\r\nIt is a general opinion, that a heavy plough is more disadvantageous\r\nthan a light one; because the draft of the former, being greater,\r\nwill be more fatiguing to the cattle: but the experiments of the\r\nagricultural society in London, establish a contrary doctrine, and\r\nshow, that in light grounds, the labour is more easily and better\r\nperformed, with a heavy, than with a light plough.\r\n\r\n5th. The _coulter_ is a species of knife inserted in the beam, and\r\nso placed before the soc, as to cut the sod. It is susceptible of\r\nbeing raised or depressed at will.\r\n\r\n6th. The handles of the plough ought to be made of some kind of\r\nheavy wood, that they may operate as a counter-weight to the head,\r\nthe soc and the mould-board.\r\n\r\nTo these remarks we subjoin two sets of experiments made with\r\nthe most approved French and English ploughs; that of Guillaume,\r\nand Small's _Rotheram plough improved_, which furnish a means of\r\ncomparison between the best ploughs of Europe and those of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe resistance (stated in these tables) was measured and ascertained\r\nby a _dynonometer_, a machine, indispensable to those who would make\r\ncorrect observations on the relative advantages of different ploughs.\r\n\r\n    _The French Plough._        _The English Plough._\r\n  Resistance in pounds.

But of whatever form, its\r\nuses are the same; to smooth the field after ploughing, to break and\r\npulverize the clods, and to cover the seed.--These uses sufficiently\r\nindicate the propriety of employing two in succession; one of\r\nheavy frame, with few and long teeth, like the Scotch brake; the\r\nother, of lighter constitution, with more and shorter teeth. Our\r\nown experience leads us to believe, that the common harrow covers\r\nthe seed too much, because small seeds will not vegetate at a depth\r\ngreater than three inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Roller_ is a cylinder of heavy wood, turning on gudgeons,\r\nor on an axle, and placed in a frame, to which is attached a shaft;\r\nit is of different dimensions, but need not exceed that which may\r\nbe drawn by one, or at most by two horses or oxen. This instrument\r\nis indispensable in good husbandry, yet is rarely used in ours.\r\nIts offices are three-fold--to render loose soils more compact; to\r\nbreak the clod on stiff ones, and on both, to compress the earth,\r\n(after seeding) so that it be every where brought in contact with\r\nthe grain. It is also usefully employed in reinstating the roots of\r\nmeadow grasses, loosened and raised by the alternate freezing and\r\nthawing of the ground, and, with similar view, may be passed over\r\nwinter crops early in the spring.\r\n\r\nIts clod-breaking and pulverizing property is much increased, by\r\nsurrounding the roller with narrow bands of iron, two inches broad,\r\nthree inches thick, and six inches asunder; or by studding it with\r\niron points, resembling harrow teeth, and projecting three or four\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Threshing Machine_ is of English invention, and may be well\r\nenough adapted to the taste and circumstances of rich amateurs, but\r\nnot at all to those of farmers in general. Our objections to it\r\nare three--the first cost, which is great; the quantum of moving\r\npower employed, which is equal to that of six horses, and the number\r\nof hands required to attend it, which is not less than four. We\r\nhave seen, in France, a machine for the same purpose, but of much\r\nsimpler structure--called the \"_Rouleau de depiquer_\" which is only\r\na _fluted cylinder_; yet simple and cheap as this was, it could not\r\nmaintain itself against the more ancient instruments--the flail and\r\nthe horse. Still it is to be hoped, that new experiments may succeed\r\nbetter and abridge the manual labour usually given to this branch of\r\nhusbandry, and, that the mechanical genius of our own country (which\r\nis not inferior to that of any other) may be the first to combine\r\n_power_ and _cheapness_ in this machine.\r\n\r\nThis hope is probably suggested, by the description of a new\r\ninvented threshing machine, now before me, and which I may be\r\npermitted to transcribe from the letter of the inventor. \"The\r\nmachine I have built, is three feet wide. One horse will thresh\r\nwith much ease, as much wheat as can be laid on it, by one man,\r\n(the straw to be taken away by another,) say, from _fifty_ to _one\r\nhundred bushels in a day_, and the saving of grain will pay for the\r\nlabour; for, I think, that with good attendance, not a particle of\r\ngrain can escape with the straw.--The expense of the machine will be\r\nfrom _fifty_ to _seventy dollars_, exclusive of the moving power,\r\nwhich is a wheel, about ten feet diameter, on an upright shaft, to\r\nwhich a lever is fixed to hitch the horse. Into this main wheel,\r\na small one should be made to work, about two feet diameter, on a\r\nshaft carrying a drum, four feet wide. With this simple gearing,\r\nand drawn by a horse that walks well, the machine will give about\r\neighteen hundred strokes in a minute, and if fully attended, will,\r\nwithout hard labour for the horse, thresh a _bushel every three_ or\r\n_four minutes_. It stands in my barn, and may be seen and examined\r\nby any one.\"[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] Mr. Levi M'Keen, of Poughkeepsie.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _The Fanning Mill_. Other things being equal, the cleanest wheat\r\nis most easily preserved, and, on manufacture, gives the best flour,\r\nand in the largest quantity. These considerations offer inducement\r\nenough for the employment of this machine, which, however, besides\r\ndoing its business well, saves a great deal of time. It is too well\r\nknown to require description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON BONES, &c. AS MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carbon and hydrogen abounding in oily substances fully account\r\nfor their effects; and their durability is explained from the\r\ngradual manner in which they change by the action of air and water.\r\n\r\n_Bones_ are much used as a manure in the neighbourhood of\r\nLondon.--After being broken and boiled for grease, they are sold to\r\nthe farmer. The more divided they are, the more powerful are their\r\neffects. The expense of grinding them in a mill would probably be\r\nrepaid by the increase of their fertilizing powers; and in the state\r\nof powder they might be used in the drill husbandry, and delivered\r\nwith the seed in the same manner as rape cake.\r\n\r\nBone dust, and bone shavings, the refuse of the turning manufacture,\r\nmay be advantageously employed in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe basis of bone is constituted by earthy salts, principally\r\nphosphate of lime, with some carbonate of lime and phosphate of\r\nmagnesia; the easily decomposed substances in bone are fat, gelatine\r\nand cartilage, which seems of the same nature as coagulated albumen.\r\n\r\nAccording to the analysis of Fourcroy and Vauquelin ox bones are\r\ncomposed\r\n\r\n  Of decomposable animal matter,     51\r\n  phosphate of lime,                 37.7\r\n  carbonate of lime,                 10\r\n  phosphate of magnesia,              1.3\r\n                                    -----\r\n                                    100.\r\n                                    -----\r\n\r\nM.

From 500 grains of\r\nox-horn, Mr. Hatchett obtained only 1-5 grains of earthy residuum,\r\nand not quite half of this was phosphate of lime. The shaving or\r\nturnings of horn form an excellent manure, though they are not\r\nsufficiently abundant to be in common use. The animal matter in them\r\nseems to be of the nature of coagulated albumen, and it is slowly\r\nrendered soluble by the action of water. The earthy matter in horn\r\nand still more that in bones, prevents the too rapid decomposition\r\nof the animal matter, and renders it very durable in its effects.\r\n\r\n  --[_Davy's Ag. Chem._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moniteur contains a very long report by Decaze, which is\r\npublished, as having been approved of by the king on the state\r\nof agriculture in France. It appears from this document that\r\nthe fostering care of the government is steadily, and in most\r\ninstances, successfully, exercised in promoting every branch of\r\ncultivation adapted to the French soil and climate. One branch,\r\nthat of the culture of the beet root, which it was supposed would\r\nhave languished on the restoration of the sugar colonies, is stated\r\nto be gradually but firmly extending itself, and its encouragement\r\nis recommended to the government, among other considerations, on\r\nthe special ground on which it was originally introduced, that of\r\nrendering France independent of foreign supplies of sugar in a\r\nperiod of war. It has been affirmed, that those who manufacture\r\ninto sugar beet root, raised on their own farms, realized a profit\r\nof 25 per cent.; and on the supposition that a quantity were raised\r\nadequate to supply the total consumption of sugar in France, it is\r\nsaid that the refuse of the beet root would of itself suffice to\r\nfatten for the market annually 120,000 head of cattle.--There are\r\nnow about twenty beet root sugar refineries in full activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGETOWN, (S.C.) April 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Agricultural Prize worth winning._--We are informed by a\r\ngentleman from Stateburg, that fourteen or more members of the\r\nClaremont Agricultural Society, of that neighbourhood, have agreed\r\nto plant, each an acre of ground in corn, to be manured and\r\ncultivated at pleasure.--The planter producing the most neat corn\r\nto the acre, (as a reward for his superiour farming) is to receive\r\nthe produce of every other acre. The land to be planted must be high\r\nland, and have been cleared at least five years. A committee of five\r\nmembers were appointed to approve of the land, to superintend the\r\ngathering and measuring the corn, and to report to the Society at\r\nits meeting in the fall, when we will be able to inform our readers\r\nof the successful planter, and the neat product of each acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CULTURE OF THE SUGAR MAPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis valuable tree seems to be equally well adapted for ornament\r\nand for profit. No tree, of the deciduous class, is more elegant\r\nin appearance, and but few grow more rapidly, or live to a greater\r\nlength of years. Its shade is but little injurious to the growths of\r\ngrain, and still less to those of grass. For fuel it is inferiour to\r\nno wood whatever. It may be cultivated in mowing and pasture lands,\r\nprobably as closely as at the rate of 20 trees on an acre, without\r\nany essential injury to the pasture, or growth of the meadow. The\r\nquantity of sugar to be made yearly from the sap of the tree must,\r\nhowever, depend on its size, and on the rapidity of its growth. The\r\nquicker its growth, the more sap may be extracted from it, because\r\nthe alburnum (sap wood) is always in the greatest proportion where\r\nthe tree is most flourishing.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of the growth of young trees, when transplanted,\r\ndepends very essentially on the manner of performing that operation.\r\nThe greater the depth and superficial extent, to which the ground\r\nis loosened, round where a young tree is to be set, the more rapid\r\nwill be its growth when placed in this bed of loosened earth. Let\r\none young tree, for instance, be set in a hole dug only 18 inches\r\nin diameter, and a foot in depth, and let another be set in a hole\r\ndug 6 feet wide, and 2 feet deep, and the latter will, for a number\r\nof succeeding years, grow with more than double the rapidity of the\r\nformer. In order, then, to give the young maples a rapid start, so\r\nas to have them soon fitted for affording considerable supplies of\r\nsap, let due attention be paid to this particular. Let the holes\r\nfor the trees be dug, say, a foot in depth, and five in diameter,\r\nand then spade or loosen the ground at the bottoms to the depth of 8\r\nor 10 inches more before the young trees are to be set in.\r\n\r\nIn addition to planting maples in grounds intended as permanent\r\npastures, and mowing grounds, each side of the highway, leading\r\nthrough any farm, might be profitably occupied and adorned with\r\nthese trees, set at the distance of about every two rods. Suppose\r\nalso that the farm house were placed in a spacious court yard, say\r\nof an acre in extent, and this planted with a suitable number of\r\nmaples, could any thing confer more of an air of pleasantness and\r\nelegance to the mansion?\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt any computation of the probable profits to\r\nbe derived from this proposed improvement in rural affairs, but\r\ndoubtless the gain would be very considerable. Every farmer\r\nmight, in this way, stock his lands with a permanent growth that\r\nwould afford him a plentiful supply of sugar, that would at times\r\nafford him additions of fuel, and that would eminently serve as an\r\nembellishment of his domain, and all these essential advantages\r\nwould be derived without any essential diminution of the usual\r\nproducts of his lands.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that if the young trees be planted in the manner just\r\nmentioned, they would attain a size fit for tapping in about 15\r\nyears, after which they would probably afford yearly supplies of sap\r\nfor more than a century, if tapped in the manner least calculated to\r\ninjure them. This is to be performed, not by cutting large gashes\r\nin them with an axe, but by boring one or more holes in them, with\r\na small auger, to the depth of about 3 inches, or at all events not\r\nbeyond the extent of the sap wood. The holes should be made every\r\nyear in different parts of the trees, sometimes higher and sometimes\r\nlower, and after the sap has ceased running for the season, they\r\nshould be filled with pieces of durable wood, drove in, in order\r\nthat the wounds may be soon healed over by the subsequent growth of\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\n  J. N.\r\n  [_Plough Boy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEMISH HUSBANDRY.\r\n\r\nFrom the Plough Boy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir--Much has been said in praise of English husbandry, though it\r\nis a well known fact, that this vaunted system is surpassed in\r\nmany countries which do not possess equal natural advantages. In\r\nScotland, agriculture has progressed at least half a century beyond\r\nthat of England, where the soil and climate is far more congenial\r\nto the productions of the earth than the \"bleak mountains of\r\nCaledonia.\" But no where in the world is the contrast so marked as\r\nthat between the Flemish and English mode of cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe average produce of a crop of wheat, in England, is 24 bushels\r\nper acre. In Flanders, it is 32 bushels. In England, the system of\r\n_fallows_ almost universally prevails. In Flanders, it has been\r\nunknown from time immemorial; two crops, in many cases three,\r\nbeing uniformly raised annually upon the same field. The following\r\ncomparative tables, as exhibited in \"Vanderstracten's sketch of the\r\nFlemish system,\" shew clearly and correctly its superior advantages\r\nover that of England.\r\n\r\n  _Produce of the Flemish farmer  | _Produce of the English farmer,\r\n     from one acre, for 12        |    according to the Norfolk\r\n     years._                      |    course, for the same period._\r\n                                  |\r\n    Wheat, 32 bush. per           | Wheat, 24 bush. per\r\n    acre                  4 crops | acre,                   3 crops\r\n    Barley, do.     do.   4  do.  | Barley, 32 do.  do.     3  do.\r\n    Flax, hemp, coleseed          | Turnips,                3  do.\r\n    & potatoes,           4  do.  | Clover,                 3  do.\r\n    Roots and vegetables          |\r\n    for the food                  |\r\n    of cattle,           10  do.  |\r\n                         -------- |                        --------\r\n                                  |\r\n        In 12 years,     24 crops |        In 12 years,    12 crops\r\n\r\nThis immense difference in favour of the produce of Flanders, does\r\nnot arise, as might be supposed, from its possessing a better\r\nnatural soil, or a milder climate, than England; but entirely from\r\nthe different mode of cultivation pursued in these two countries. At\r\nno very distant period, the fields of Flanders, now so productive,\r\nwere little else but loose sand and gravel, whereas the soil of\r\nEngland, was always naturally fertile, and in part, lies under a\r\nmore southerly parallel than Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe rich, abundant, and healthy crops obtained by the Flemish\r\nfarmers, may be traced to the following causes:\r\n\r\nI. The abundance and judicious application of manure. II. Digging\r\nall the lands on their farms with the spade, every six or every\r\nthree years. III. The complete extirpation of weeds and noxious\r\nroots. IV. Regular and repeated hoeing. V. A careful choice, and\r\nalternation, of grain and seeds for sowing. VI. An improved rotation\r\nof crops.\r\n\r\n\"The whole secret (observes Vanderstracten) respecting the\r\nsuperiority of Flemish agriculture, consists in this; the farmers\r\nprocure plenty of food for their cattle--food which, excepting\r\nclover, is raised from the same lands which have already yielded\r\ntheir crops of grain, &c. They keep the greatest possible number of\r\ncattle, feed them in the stables plentifully, and render their food\r\npalatable. They collect the greatest possible quantity of manure, of\r\nwhich they preserve the fertilizing salts by a suitable process of\r\nfermentation.--They weed their grounds thoroughly and repeatedly.\r\nThey totally extirpate noxious plants and roots, every six or every\r\nthree years, by digging all the lands on their respective farms--an\r\noperation by which they revert to the surface a stratum of fresh\r\nsoil, that for three or for six years has been absorbing the salts\r\nof manure as they filtrated to the bottom of the roots: a stratum\r\nof soil which has produced no crop during the same period. They,\r\nmoreover, dress their grounds to the precise point of perfect\r\npulverization. These are inestimable advantages, which cannot be\r\nobtained by any plough whatever; hence the drift of the Flemish\r\nadage--\"Never to let the naked ground lie open to the sun in summer\r\nfor more than three days.\"\r\n\r\n\"In truth, to say that there exists a vast province, in which the\r\nprice of lands has been quadrupled within fifty years, and which is\r\nneither placed under a more favourable climate, nor enjoys a greater\r\nfertility of soil, than England; from which fallows in general have\r\nbeen banished from time immemorial; in which the greater part of\r\nthe lands produce in 9 years at least 15 harvests, of which those\r\nof grain yield, one year with another, as high as 32 bushels of\r\nwheat per acre; those of barley, 60 bushels; and those of oats, 90\r\nbushels; and where the borders of the fields are planted with trees,\r\nin such numbers, that by their sale the proprietors acquire, every\r\n40 years, a sum of money equal to the soil; to say this, appears,\r\nto other than English readers, to repeat a tissue of fables.[9] The\r\nless informed attribute this uninterrupted succession of harvests\r\nto the inexhaustible fertility of the soil; but intelligent and\r\nwell-informed travellers attribute it, on the contrary, and with the\r\nbest reason, to the indefatigable industry of the inhabitants, and\r\nto a highly improved mode of culture, of the details of which they\r\nthemselves are ignorant, and which beside, from their complication,\r\nand the great variety of the productions of the soil, require a\r\nprofound study, of many years duration, to which few of them have\r\neither the inclination or the leisure to apply.\"\r\n\r\n  [9] In Flanders, wheat yields 20; rye, 26; barley, 26; and oats, 40,\r\n  for one.--Wheat holds only the fifth rank in value in the harvest of\r\n  Flanders. In England, wheat never yields more, on an average, than\r\n  10 or 11 for one; barley, something less than 10 to 1; and oats only\r\n  between 8 and 9 for one. In some highly ameliorated farms in the\r\n  county of Suffolk, Arthur Young reports a produce of 36 bushels of\r\n  wheat, and 64 bushels of barley to the acre; and that in the county\r\n  of Kent, soils of middling quality, equally ameliorated, yield per\r\n  acre 52 bushels of wheat, and the same quantity of barley. But in\r\n  Flanders, there are soils which yield much more than this--namely,\r\n  72 bushels of wheat, 120 of barley, 128 of beans, and 72 of\r\n  coleseed.--These, however, are extreme cases, which do not affect\r\n  the general question of comparative growths; while, however, they\r\n  shew that the amelioration of land, in any country, is calculated\r\n  greatly to increase its productiveness.\r\n\r\nThis correct, though \"bird's eye\" view, of Flemish husbandry,\r\nmerits farther amplification, in order to furnish distinct data\r\nto the intelligent and enterprising agriculturist. My subsequent\r\ncommunications will be directed to that subject.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\n  GEO. HOUSTON.\r\n\r\n  _New York, April 18, 1820._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Raleigh Star._\r\n\r\nLINCOLN CORN POUNDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usual mode of feeding Indian corn to cattle and hogs, is\r\nwasteful in the extreme. The cob is not eaten, and the corn is\r\nneither ground nor boiled. It is a well established physiological\r\nfact, that the good health of animals requires, that the aliments\r\nfor the stomach should afford both nutriment and mechanical\r\ndistention in due proportions. In the usual method of feeding, these\r\nproportions do not exist, and besides the nutritious quality is only\r\npartially extracted. The grinding of corn is sometimes practised\r\nby those who have mills, and boiling by those who have not. Meal\r\nis sometimes mixed with hot water and fermented. All these are\r\nimprovements in feeding, but these are not sufficient. Lately, a\r\nmill of cast iron has been invented, which converts both corn and\r\ncob into meal, and is used also by tanners in grinding their bark.\r\nThis improvement is valuable. The cob, while it affords in itself\r\nmuch nutriment, furnishes a degree of distension to the stomach,\r\nwhich is necessary to its proper action. If to this grinding of the\r\ncob and grain is superadded fermentation, or boiling, the economical\r\nprocess is nearly complete. I have not time to say what the subject\r\nrequires in regard to fermentation. Boiling not only renders the\r\narticles acted on soluble in the stomach, but it does more--it adds\r\nnutriment furnished by the water itself. The experiments of Count\r\nRumford are full and satisfactory on this head. Let those who doubt\r\nthe nutritive qualities of water be reminded that many kinds of\r\nfish live, grow and fatten in pure water, without any other food\r\nwhatever.---Every one has seen the gold fish, which have lived\r\nfor years in globes of pure water, that are sometimes put by the\r\ncurious into cages of canary birds. Water and air constitute the\r\nentire aliment of vegetables, and give them bulk without diminishing\r\nat all the quantity of soil in which they grow. The perfection of\r\nfeeding corn consists in preserving the cob, grinding the whole\r\ninto meal, and in the cookery. The iron mill is excellent, but too\r\nexpensive for most farmers. What is wanting, then, is to have the\r\ncorn, with its cob, powdered by some cheap and simple method, that\r\nevery one may avail themselves of. Such a one, accident lately made\r\nme acquainted with; and I think it is so valuable that I am desirous\r\nof seeing it introduced into general use, and shall attempt a\r\ndescription of the machine by which the process was effected.\r\n\r\nThis machine I saw last summer in operation, on the road between\r\nLincolnton and Morgantown. It was a horizontal shaft with a beater\r\nat one end, poised by the weight of water falling into an excavation\r\nat the other. The shaft or helve was about fourteen, possibly\r\nsixteen feet long. At two thirds of its length from the beater, it\r\nrested by a notch across the sharpened edge of a piece of timber\r\nlying in a transverse direction, serving as a pivot or fulcrum for\r\nthe shaft to move on. The beater was a piece of wood two feet, or\r\nrather more, in length, fixed by a mortice and tennon to the end of\r\nthe shaft; its face was about two inches and a half in diameter,\r\nand plated with iron. The mortar which received this pestal, or\r\nbeater, was the hollowed end of a log, wide at top, narrower at\r\nbottom, and would contain nearly a bushel. The other, or shorter end\r\nof the shaft, was excavated into a trough about three feet long,\r\neight inches wide, and the same in depth. The extreme inner end of\r\nthe trough formed an angle of ascent from the line of the bottom\r\nof about 35 degrees, affording thereby an easy exit to the water\r\nwhen depressed by its weight. This very simple machine, for I have\r\ndescribed the whole of it, was placed upon the small run of a spring\r\nbranch, where there was a descent of about two feet. The water was\r\nconveyed into the trough by a spout which approached it at right\r\nangles, and the trough was filled and discharged about twice in a\r\nminute. Every morning, and again at evening, this mortar was filled\r\nwith ears of corn, which in twelve hours were found reduced to a\r\nvery fine meal. It was capable of converting to meal three or four\r\nmortars full in a day, but two were sufficient for the use of the\r\nplantation, and the mortar was attended to only when it could be\r\ndone with convenience. In a wet season, when the spring run afforded\r\nmore water, it moved with increased celerity, and was capable of\r\nincreased work. The machine was without cover, and I observed\r\nbarn-door fowls around it, but afraid of the motion of the shaft,\r\nthey never ventured to purloin from the mortar. The whole expense of\r\nthis, I think, could not have exceeded four or five dollars.\r\n\r\nI know not the inventor of this machine. There were a few others, I\r\nwas told, in Lincoln and Burke. Its extreme simplicity, cheapness\r\nand utility, and the means afforded to almost every one of putting\r\nit in motion, ought to recommend it to general use. I am persuaded\r\nthis method of pounding corn, united to boiling or fermentation,\r\nwould double the value of crops for feeding. No rule is necessary\r\nto be observed with regard to the dimensions, or proportions of the\r\nmachine. It must duly be noticed that the trough filled with water\r\nis heavy enough to raise the bearer; and this can be ascertained,\r\nand the proportions duly adjusted by experiment.----If Mr. Henderson\r\nthink but half as favourably of this machine as I do, he will give\r\nthe foregoing a place in his useful paper.\r\n\r\n  CALVIN JONES.\r\n\r\n  _Raleigh, Dec. 20, 1820._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSACTIONS OF THE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An improved method of cultivating the Alpine Strawberry._----The\r\nstrawberry is a fruit which is agreeable to the palate of so many\r\npersons, and which disagrees with the constitution of so few, that\r\nany means of improving the culture of it, and of prolonging the\r\nseason of its maturity and perfection, will be acceptable to the\r\nHorticultural Society: I am therefore induced to send an account of\r\nan improved method of cultivating the _Alpine Strawberry_, that is,\r\nI believe, little if at all known, and that I have practised with\r\nthe best possible success.\r\n\r\nThough the flavour of the Alpine varieties is generally approved,\r\nthey are not much thought of while the larger varieties continue in\r\nperfection, and are valued only as an autumnal crop. I was therefore\r\nled to try several different methods of culture, with a view to\r\nobtain plants that would just begin to blossom when the other\r\nvarieties cease; conceiving that such plants, not having expended\r\neither themselves, or the virtue of the soil, in a previous crop\r\nof fruit, would afford the best and most abundant autumnal produce.\r\nUnder this impression, I sowed the seeds of the best Alpine variety\r\nthat I had ever been able to obtain, in pots of mould, in the\r\nbeginning of August, the seeds of the preceding year having been\r\npreserved to that period; and the plants these afforded were placed,\r\nin the end of March, in beds to produce fruit. This experiment\r\nsucceeded tolerably well; but I was not quite satisfied with it;\r\nfor though my plants produced an abundant autumnal crop of fruit,\r\nthey began to blossom somewhat earlier than I wished, and before\r\nthey were perfectly well rooted in the soil. I therefore tried the\r\nexperiment of sowing some seeds of the same variety early in the\r\nspring, in pots which I placed in a hotbed of moderate strength in\r\nthe beginning of April, and the plants thus raised were removed to\r\nthe beds in which they were to remain in the open ground as soon\r\nas they had acquired a sufficient size. They began to blossom soon\r\nafter midsummer, and to ripen their fruit towards the end of July,\r\naffording a most abundant crop of very fine fruit. The powers of\r\nlife in plants thus raised, being young and energetic, operate\r\nmuch more powerfully than in the runners of older plants, or even\r\nin plants raised from seeds in the preceding year; and therefore I\r\nthink the Alpine strawberry ought always to be treated as an annual\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOILING FRUIT TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir George M'Kenzie has discovered that oil rubbed upon the stems\r\nand branches of fruit trees destroys insects, and increases the\r\nfruit buds. Mr. John Linning has added to the discovery, by using it\r\nsuccessfully upon the stems of carnations, to guard them against the\r\ndepredations of the ear-wig. The coarsest oil will suit, and only a\r\nsmall quantity is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURE OF FOREST TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Watkin Williams Wynn has planted within the last 5 years, in the\r\nmountainous lands in the vicinity of Langollen, situated from 12,000\r\nto 14,000 feet above the level of the sea, 39,000 oaks, 63,000\r\nSpanish chesnuts, 102,000 spruce firs, 110,000 Scotch firs, 90,000\r\nlarches, 30,000 wych elms, 35,000 mountain elms, 80,000 ash, and\r\n40,000 sycamores, all of which are at this time, in a healthy and\r\nthriving condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT DECAY IN TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen old chesnut or other trees are rotted within the trunk, and\r\nthreaten with speedy destruction by the progress of the carious\r\ntaint, it may be stopped by applying fire to the decayed part, so as\r\nto _char_ the whole of the neighbouring surfaces. By this management\r\nthe life of a favourite tree may often be preserved.\r\n\r\n  [_Chaptal's Chemistry_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON PLASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just received my _plaster_ from the mill. I remarked to the\r\nman who brought it, that it was too coarse. He replied that all\r\nour farmers preferred it coarse, and assigned this reason--that in\r\ngrinding it fine, _it becomes so heated as to injure it_. I delay\r\nnot a moment in expostulating against a doctrine so unphilosophical,\r\nand so injurious to the interests of agriculture. Every farmer knows\r\nthat _grain_, as _food_ for _animals_ cannot be made too fine. Upon\r\nthe same principle, _plaster_, which is _food_ for _vegetables_,\r\naffords the most nutriment when reduced to the finest powder.\r\n_Heat_ so far from injuring the properties of plaster, is the best\r\nagent for bringing them into action. This theory is the result\r\nof repeated experiment. Calcined plaster, which is produced by a\r\nprocess of _intense heat_, is found much more invigorating, and more\r\npermanently beneficial, than plaster in its simple state.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, I will suggest for consideration, whether\r\nour farmers, generally spread a sufficient quantity of plaster\r\nparticularly on their grass land. Mr. Silas Gates, a well known\r\nfarmer in Marlborough, informed me, that he directed one of his men\r\nto spread on a certain piece of mowing land, the usual quantity,\r\n(if I mistake not, at the rate of one bushel to the acre.) He had\r\ngone over about half the ground, at this rate, when other calls\r\nprevented his finishing it. Soon after the business of plastering\r\nwas consigned to another, who, not knowing that any had been spread,\r\nwent over the ground, giving one half a double portion.--The result\r\nwas nearly a double portion of hay, which continued until the\r\nsurface was changed by a rotation of crops.\r\n\r\n  Your obed't, O FISKE.\r\n\r\n  Worcester, April 17, 1820.\r\n\r\n  [_Mass.

They are already basking in the sun, and expanding\r\nby the nutricious aliment of foliage and fruit buds; and if not\r\nprematurely molested, (which there is little reason to apprehend) we\r\nmay, in due time, taste from our kneading troughs the former repasts\r\nof Egypt.\r\n\r\nJudging from the produce of last year, it may be fairly calculated\r\nthat many of our farmers, (and some who _do not belong to the\r\nAgricultural Society_) will, this year, raise double as many\r\nbushels of _caterpillars_ as of _apples_. Those (and there are\r\nsome,) who prefer the appearance and flavour of the latter, will do\r\nwell to look to their trees immediately. A thimble full of these\r\nreptiles, which can now be destroyed in an instant, would fill a\r\nhat a month hence, and would require tenfold the labour to subdue\r\nthem.

You may then take off the lid, and cut away as much of the\r\nhoney as you may think proper. If the operation be performed the\r\nbeginning of July, you may take nearly all, as there will be time\r\nenough to provide a sufficiency for their support during the winter.\r\nAs soon as you have taken the honey, put on the lid, loosen the\r\ncloth, and spread it out, and in an hour or two the bees will have\r\nreturned into the hive. It may then be replaced on the stand, and on\r\nthe following day they will be found at work as usual.\r\n\r\nThis method is very simple, and preferable to that sometimes\r\npractised, of driving the bees into another hive; as you get all\r\nthe honey, and moreover the new comb, which is still empty; and the\r\nyoung bees, not yet out of the cells, are preserved. There is also\r\ndanger in driving, of their not liking their new habitation, and, in\r\nthat case, of their sallying out and making war on their neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe above method has frequently been practised by myself and others,\r\nand we have always found it to do well.\r\n\r\n  AMATOR MELLIS.\r\n\r\n  _Washington, June, 1819._ [_Am.

Henry Braconnot, of Geneva, of the whole process\r\nof this singular discovery; and are now so well satisfied there is\r\nnothing of \"pleasantry\" in the matter, as at first sight appeared\r\nto many, that, should we be told to-morrow that, as linen may\r\nbe converted into its constituent principle, sugar--(a piece of\r\nfine Irish linen into a loaf of double refined!)--so may wool be\r\nconverted into its constituent principle, fat--(an old threadbare\r\ncoat into a basin of fine gravy soup!)--we shall be prepared to look\r\nquite grave at the announcement.\r\n\r\n\"The conversion of wood into sugar (says M. Braconnot) will, no\r\ndoubt, appear remarkable; and when persons not familiar with\r\nchemical speculations are told that a pound weight of rags can be\r\nconverted into _more_ than a pound of sugar, they may regard the\r\nstatement as a piece of pleasantry, though nothing can be more real.\"\r\n\r\nThe agent in making this wonderful conversion is sulphuric acid,\r\nand those to whom it may not be enough to know that the thing can\r\nbe done, will find ample directions as to the _modus operandi_ in\r\nM. Braconnot's Memoir. We shall content ourselves here with one\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n\"I made these 359.2 gr. of sugary matter (obtained from old cloth\r\nwell dried) into the consistency of sirup; at the end of twenty-four\r\nhours it began to crystallize; and some days after, the whole was\r\nsolidified into a single mass of crystallized sugar, which was\r\npressed strongly between several folds of old cloth; crystallized\r\na second time, this sugar was passably pure; but, treated with\r\n_animal_ charcoal, it became of a shining whiteness.--The crystals\r\nwere in spherical groupes, which appear to be formed by the union\r\nof small diverging and unequal plates. They are fusible at the\r\ntemperature of boiling water. This sugar, of a fresh and agreeable\r\nflavour, produced in the mouth a slight sensation of coolness. It\r\ndissolves in hot alcohol, and crystallizes by cooling. Dissolved\r\nin water, and mixed with a little yeast, it fermented; the vinous\r\nliquor which resulted, furnished alcohol by distillation. Burned\r\nwith potash, and its charcoal washed with diluted nitric acid, it\r\nyielded a fluid not troubled by nitrate or barytes. It would be\r\nuseless to insist farther on the properties of this sugar: it is\r\nevident that it is perfectly identical with the sugar of grapes or\r\nof starch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUTA BAGA EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1819, July 27--Sowed three fourths of an acre of Ruta Baga, in\r\nground prepared as follows, viz.--Stubble turned in deep--harrowed\r\nfine--furrowed deep at four feet distance--filled the furrows with\r\n_earth burnt ashes_, (burnt according to the plan prescribed by Mr.\r\nCobbett, in his \"Year's Residence,\") which I covered by turning a\r\nfurrow over them on each side; this formed a ridge about eighteen\r\ninches broad at top, which being smoothed a little with a hoe, and a\r\ndrill made along the middle of it with the same instrument; I then\r\nsowed the seed and covered it with a hoe, from one to two inches\r\ndeep; it came up on the 7th of August. When the roots were nearly\r\na fourth of an inch thick, I thinned them to about a foot distance\r\nin the rows, and kept them free from weeds by two good ploughings\r\nand hoeings, (they would have been the better for a third)\r\nnotwithstanding the unexpected dry season;--the last of November,\r\nmany of them would measure fifteen inches in circumference--I left\r\nthem to stand in the ground all winter. I was off the state, from\r\nthe middle of December to the middle of February; on my return at\r\nthe latter period, the snow had just disappeared, when I found my\r\nturnips had grown at least one fifth larger, since I saw them in\r\nDecember; many of them measuring six to seven inches diameter. The\r\nlatter part of February was unusually warm for the season. The tops\r\nbegan to grow rapidly, but the severe cold nights of the early part\r\nof March, first freezing, and the warmth of the middle of the day,\r\nas often thawing them; many rotted in the ground--had they been\r\npulled when the warm weather _commenced_, this would have been\r\nprevented. They are the cheapest, and with the exception of corn,\r\nthey are the best food for milch cows and hogs, I ever met with--I\r\nhave been feeding mine upon them for the last 6 weeks. Within a\r\nweek past, I had them all pulled, (except those left for seed,) and\r\nthrown in heaps. Should the weather prove too warm, I shall spread\r\nthem, in which way they will keep good until midsummer. Having\r\nrepeatedly heard it asserted, that horses would not eat them, I\r\ndetermined to ascertain the truth of the assertion; accordingly, a\r\nparcel of them were washed and cut in pieces, and each horse served\r\nwith about 3 galls. of them, when two out of five eat them greedily,\r\ntwo others eat them, but with less appetite, and the fifth refused.\r\nThey had no other food allowed them for the night, and the next\r\nmorning not the smallest piece was to be found in their trough.\r\n\r\n  [_Am.

If the\r\nfollowing short directions should prove the means of changing even\r\none thorn bush into a pear or quince tree, I shall be fully paid for\r\nthe trouble of scribbling them down.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August and fore part of September, cut from the tree\r\nyou wish to increase some of the young wood of the last summer's\r\ngrowth, (the cuttings should be thrifty and healthy) cut the leaves\r\noff, leaving about half an inch of the foot stalk on the cutting;\r\nat the foot, and immediately above the foot stalk, _lies the bud_;\r\nwith a keen knife begin to cut half an inch above the bud, and bring\r\nout the knife a little below, taking about half the woody substance\r\nwith it; then separate the bark from the wood, carefully observing\r\nthat the bud be not injured in the operation. If the operation be\r\nproperly performed, the bud will be separated from the wood, and\r\nremain unbroken and entire in the bark: this bark and bud is now\r\nto be speedily inserted into the tree you wish to change. Choose a\r\nsmooth spot in some young and healthy branch, or sprout, and with a\r\nkeen knife cut gently through the bark, about one inch in length,\r\nand a small cross cut near the upper end; separate the bark gently\r\nfrom the wood at this cross cut, being careful not to wound the bark\r\nor wood, and immediately insert the bud, laying it smooth and even\r\nunder the bark of the tree; with a string of bass wood bark, or\r\nwoollen yarn, tie it in so as to hold it close to the wood, being\r\ncareful not to injure the bud nor foot stock--and the operation is\r\ndone.--In two or three weeks after, the bud will have united to\r\nthe wood, and the tyings should be loosened or taken away. The\r\nbud will remain dormant until the next spring. In April following,\r\nthey should be examined, and if the buds then appear healthy and\r\nvigorous, the branch should be cut off immediately above the bud,\r\nand removed: in a few weeks this bud will take place of the old\r\nbranch, and in two years produce fruit of the kind you wish.\r\n\r\nBy this simple operation, the ordinary sour peach tree, which is an\r\nincumberer of the ground, may be made to yield the delicious Rare\r\nRipe, the Early Ann, or other favourite peaches; or may be converted\r\ninto a plum tree: and the ordinary _wild plum tree_ may be made to\r\nyield the richest and most delicious of our cultivated plums and\r\npeaches; our thorn bushes may be made to yield the rich and luscious\r\npear; and our crab apple stalks be loaded with the finest varieties\r\nof our cultivated apples and cherries; apricots and nectarines are\r\nequally susceptible of improvement by the same easy means; nay, our\r\nwild gooseberry bushes may be converted into the best varieties, and\r\nour native grape may be made to yield an elegant dessert fruit.--All\r\nwhich I know by\r\n\r\n  EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\n  [_Plough Boy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEAR TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pear tree, brought from Holland, and planted in the year 1647, is\r\nnow in full bloom, standing in the Third Avenue at the intersection\r\nof Thirteenth Street, New York. This is probably the oldest fruit\r\ntree in America. About 70 years ago the branches of the tree decayed\r\nand fell off, and at that time it was supposed the tree was dying;\r\nbut without any artificial means being resorted to, new shoots\r\ngerminated and gradually supplied the room of their predecessors.\r\nThe tree now is in full health and vigour, and appears to be not\r\nmore than 30 years old; the fruit ripens the latter part of August,\r\nhas a rich succulent flavour, and has been known by the name of the\r\nspice pear.\r\n\r\n  [_Evening Post._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_On raising young Potatoes in the Winter months._--In the beginning\r\nof May, lay a quantity of the largest ox-noble Potatoes, on a dry\r\ncellar floor, two or three deep, and turn them over once in about\r\nthree weeks, rubbing off all the white sprouts as they appear, but\r\nnot the spawn or rudiments of the young potatoes. At the end of\r\nSeptember, have ready a few boxes; at the bottom of each put six\r\ninches of decayed leaves, dried to a vegetable mould, and place\r\nupon it a single layer of potatoes, close to each other; then put\r\nanother layer of the same mould, six inches deep, then another of\r\npotatoes, and so on till the boxes are full.--Set the boxes in a dry\r\ncovered place, free from frost, never giving them any water.--They\r\nwill produce good fine young potatoes in December; and those which\r\nare ready may be taken off, and the old potatoes replaced until the\r\nremainder of the produce shall be ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cure for foundered horses, by a surgical operation._--\"The\r\noperation has succeeded admirably and will probably lead to a\r\nsimilar practice in the human subject. It has hitherto failed\r\nfrequently in the _Tic Doloureux_ and other diseases, either\r\nfrom the regeneration of the divided nerve producing a union and\r\nrestoration of sensation, or from the effect being produced by\r\nthe swelling of the ends of the cut nerve sufficient to effect\r\nthe union. But the excision of two inches in length effectually\r\nprevents such a restoration of feeling. Mr. Sewell, the well known\r\nassistant professor at the Veterinary College, who has the exclusive\r\nclaim to this improvement, in the course of the last eighteen\r\nmonths, performed this operation on above 100 horses, with uniform\r\nsuccess, except perhaps two or three cases, in which there was\r\ngreat organical disease of the foot. Although the operation requires\r\nthe skill of Mr. Sewell, it is very simple. It consists in cutting\r\ndown upon the trunks of the nerves which enter the foot in contact\r\nwith the arteries, on each side of either the small or large pastern\r\njoint, and then removing a piece of the nerve. A few minutes after\r\nthe operation, the animal walks and trots like a sound horse, which\r\njust before could scarcely move at all, and then in extreme pain.\r\nThe principle is obvious--it is that of removing the conductors of\r\nsensation from the seat in the disease to the brain. The division of\r\nthe arteries accompanying the nerves is carefully avoided.\"--_Journ.\r\nArts and Science._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To destroy insects which infest fruit trees._--Take a small\r\nquantity of unslackened lime, mix it with soft water, to the\r\nconsistency of very thin whitewash--apply this mixture with a brush,\r\nto the trees, as soon as the sap begins to rise, and wash the\r\nstems and large boughs with it, taking care to have it done in dry\r\nweather, that it may adhere and withstand rain. In the course of\r\nthe ensuing summer, this will be found to have removed all the moss\r\nand insects, and give to the bark a fresh and green appearance.

Even if the blossoms are\r\ndiscoloured, this operation recovers them, provided it is done in\r\nthe morning before the sun shines upon them.[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] This seems to be analogous to the condition of a frost bitten\r\n  joint or limb, which is recovered by the application of cold water;\r\n  but injured, sometimes destroyed, by being brought near a fire, or\r\n  the influence of sudden warmth.\r\n\r\n_Method of forcing Fruit Trees to bear fruit._--With a sharp knife\r\nmake a cut in the bark of the branch, which you mean to force to\r\nbear, and not far from the place where it is connected with the\r\nstem; or if it be a small branch, or shoot, near where it is joined\r\nto the larger bough. The cut is to go round the branch, or to\r\nencircle it, and to penetrate to the wood. A _quarter of an inch_\r\nfrom this cut, you make a second cut, like the first, round the\r\nbranch, so that by both encircling the branch, you have marked a\r\nring upon the branch a quarter of an inch broad, between the two\r\ncuts. The bark between these two cuts you take clean away, with the\r\nknife, down to the wood, removing even the fine inner bark which\r\nlies upon the wood; so that no connection whatever remains between\r\nthe two parts of the bark, but the bare and naked wood appears white\r\nand smooth. But this bark ring, which is to compel the tree to bear,\r\nmust be made at the right time, that is, when in all nature the buds\r\nare strongly swelling, or are breaking out into blossom. In the same\r\nyear a callus is formed at the edge of the ring, on both sides, and\r\nthe connexion of the bark that had been interrupted, is restored\r\nagain without any detriment to the tree, or the branch operated\r\nupon, in which the artificial wound soon again grows over.\r\n\r\n_New mode of preparing Indian Corn._--Take the corn in its green\r\nstate, when it is fit to eat; boil it; then cut it off the\r\ncob--spread it on a cloth in the sun to dry--put it in bags, and\r\nwhen boiled again, it is as sweet and good as when first pulled.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT LAKES.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   A Table, shewing the quantity of water contained in the St. Lawrence,\r\n   and all its tributary Lakes and Rivers.\r\n   (From Darby's Tour.)\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------------------+--------------------\r\n                       |_Medium|                   |\r\n         LAKES         |depth._|_Superficial Area._| _Solid Contents._\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------------------+--------------------\r\n                       | Feet. |       Feet.       |        Feet.\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------------------+--------------------\r\n   Superior,           |  900  |   836,352,000,000 | 752,716,800,000,000\r\n   Huron,              |  900  |   527,568,000,000 | 501,811,200,000,000\r\n   Michigan,           |  900  |   376,898,400,000 |  59,208,560,000,000\r\n   Erie,               |  120  |   418,176,000,000 |  50,181,120,000,000\r\n   Ontario,            |  492  |   200,724,480,000 |  98,756,444,160,000\r\n   St. Lawrence, and } |       |                   |\r\n   other rivers and  } |   \"   |    41,176,000,000 |      83,520,000,000\r\n   smaller lakes,    } |       |                   |\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------------------+---------------------\r\n                       |       | 2,430,894,880,000 |1,742,757,644,160,000\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------------------+---------------------\r\n\r\nLake Superior, in its greatest length, is 381 miles; its breadth\r\nis 161; and its circumference is little less than 1152 miles--it\r\nis as remarkable for the transparency of its waters as for its\r\nextraordinary depth.\r\n\r\nLake Huron, from west to east, is 218 statute miles long; at its\r\nwestern extremity it is less than one hundred miles broad; and,\r\nat about one hundred miles from its eastern shore, it is barely\r\n60 miles broad; but near the centre it suddenly bends away to the\r\nsouthward, and is a hundred miles in breadth; making a circumference\r\nof little less than 812 miles.\r\n\r\nLake Michigan deepens into a bay of 262 miles in length, by\r\nsixty-five in breadth; and its entire circumference is 731 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Slave Trade._--A letter from Sierra Leone, dated Dec. 14, states,\r\nthat there was more slave-dealing carried on at that period in\r\nthe neighbouring rivers, than when it was allowed by the British\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Boston Gazette.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SKETCHES, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Americans who are known to have visited the Western\r\ncountry, were James M'Bride, and several others, who in the year\r\n1754 descended the Ohio river, as far as the mouth of Kentucky river.\r\n\r\nIn 1769, Colonel Daniel Boon, and a few others, undertook to explore\r\nthis vast wilderness, then so little known. After many hardships and\r\nfatigues, they reached the neighbourhood of Lexington, where they\r\nremained until 1771.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, Colonel Boon, with a party of soldiers and emigrants, built\r\nfort Boonsborough, which was the first settlement made in the state\r\nof Kentucky.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding many obstacles, the inhabitants of Kentucky were\r\nestimated, in 1784, at 12,000 souls.--No settlements were made north\r\nof the Ohio, until three or four years afterwards.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March, 1786, the \"Ohio Company\" was formed at Boston,\r\nconsisting of officers and soldiers of the Revolution, who, by an\r\nact of Congress, were entitled to a military grant of land, in the\r\nterritory northwest of the Ohio. This company completed a contract\r\nwith Congress for one million five hundred thousand acres, on the\r\n27th of Nov. 1787. An association of 46 men, under Gen. Rufus\r\nPutnam, proceeded to take possession of the purchase; and on the\r\n7th April following, they pitched their camp and cleared the ground\r\nwhere Marietta now stands.\r\n\r\nIn 1788, Congress passed an ordinance establishing a colonial\r\ngovernment over the Northwest Territory. Arthur St. Clair was\r\nappointed governor.\r\n\r\nCincinnati was first called Losantiville, but Governor St. Clair,\r\nin 1790, altered its name. In 1789, the population of this place\r\nconsisted of only eleven families.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, a Presbyterian church was erected at Cincinnati; and the\r\ncitizens were compelled by law, to take their fire arms with them,\r\nwhen they attended church. The first school was also established\r\nthis year, and consisted of about 30 scholars.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, the small pox broke out among the soldiers at Fort\r\nWashington, and one third of the citizens and soldiers fell victims\r\nto its ravages.--[This was the same year it spread throughout\r\nBoston.]\r\n\r\nSince the above period, the western country has increased in a ratio\r\n\"truly astonishing.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1810, the population of Cincinnati was estimated at 2300; in\r\n1813, at about 4000; and in 1819, at more than 10,000; \"an increase\r\ntruly astonishing.\" The greatest part of the population are stated\r\nto be from the middle and northern states; but there is also a mixed\r\nassemblage of emigrants, \"from almost every part of Christendom; and\r\nit is not uncommon to hear three or four different languages spoken\r\nin the streets at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1819, in Cincinnati, there were 1890 buildings, many of brick and\r\nstone, of two stories and upwards; 10 places of public worship, a\r\ncollege, five banks, court-house, jail, two market houses, several\r\nmanufactories, &c.\r\n\r\nSome of the religious societies were formed in Cincinnati, with only\r\nten members; and all have been created within 16 years. There are\r\nalso several Bible societies, Sabbath school societies, a medical\r\nsociety, humane society, &c.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of steam-boats, considerable attention has\r\nbeen paid at Cincinnati to exportation; and from October, 1818, to\r\nMarch, 1819, it amounted to $1,334,080, and consisted of flour,\r\npork, bacon, lard, tobacco, &c.; while the amount of imports, for\r\nthe same period, amounted to only $500,000. In 1817, the imports\r\namounted to $1,442,266, and in 1818, to $1,619,000! They seem to\r\nbe convinced that the only way to relieve the western states from\r\ntheir \"present embarrassments,\" is to _export more and import less_,\r\nwhich will soon effect a rapid change in their affairs.\r\n\r\nAbout 60 steam-boats, from 25 to 700 tons, and many of them finished\r\nin a style of elegance and taste, are now in successful operation,\r\nand most of them have been built within two or three years.\r\n\r\nThere are three auctioneers in Cincinnati, 25 attorneys, 22\r\nphysicians, 3 companies of \"Independent Military,\" handsomely\r\nuniformed, whose appearance is \"nowise inferior to the Eastern\r\nMilitary.\"\r\n\r\nThree newspapers are now printed at Cincinnati, all upon an imperial\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated, that 120,000 bushels of salt are sold annually at\r\nCincinnati, which at $1.50 amounts to $180,000. The various kinds of\r\nlumber sold are estimated at $150,000 a year.\r\n\r\nWe might enlarge these items, and several other articles worthy of\r\nrecord, but our limits will not permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROBBER DISAPPOINTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few months ago, a farmer living a few miles from Easton, sent his\r\ndaughter on horseback to that town, to procure from the bank smaller\r\nnotes in exchange for one of one hundred dollars. When she arrived\r\nthere the bank was shut, and she endeavoured to effect her object by\r\noffering it at several stores, but could not get her note changed.\r\nShe had not gone far on her return, when a stranger rode up to the\r\nside of her horse, and accosted her with so much politeness that she\r\nhad not the slightest suspicion of any evil intention on his part.\r\nAfter a ride of a mile or two, employed in very social conversation,\r\nthey came to a retired part of the road, and the gentleman commanded\r\nher to give him the bank note. It was with some difficulty that she\r\ncould be made to believe him in earnest, as his demeanour had been\r\nso friendly; but the presentation of a pistol placed the matter\r\nbeyond a doubt, and she yielded to necessity. Just as she held\r\nthe note to him, a sudden puff of wind blew it into the road, and\r\ncarried it gently several yards from them. The discourteous knight\r\nalighted to overtake it, and the lady whipped her horse to get out\r\nof his power, and the other horse who had been left standing by her\r\nside, started off with her. His owner fired a pistol, which only\r\ntended to increase the speed of all parties, and the young lady\r\narrived safely at home with the horse of the robber, on which was\r\na pair of saddlebags. When these were opened, they were found to\r\ncontain, besides a quantity of counterfeit bank notes, _fifteen\r\nhundred dollars in good money_! The horse was a good one, and when\r\nsaddled and bridled, was thought to be worth at least as much as the\r\nbank note that was stolen.\r\n\r\nAs this story is somewhat wonderful, I enclose you my name as a\r\nvoucher for the truth of it, and am yours, &c.\r\n\r\n  [_Nat. Recorder_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIVAUX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following anecdotes from _Esprit de Marivaux_, a book, probably,\r\nnot known to many of your readers, may serve to amuse some of them.\r\n\r\nMarivaux was scarcely less remarkable for his indolence than\r\nhis wit.--He was said to be \"by nature the laziest creature\r\nin the world;\" but his goodness appeared on the most trifling\r\ncircumstances. He was one day setting out for the country with Mad.\r\nLallemand de Bez. Marivaux and the lady's sister were already in\r\nthe coach; she staid behind to give some orders to her domestics.\r\nIn this interval, a sturdy young fellow, about eighteen or twenty,\r\nplump and fresh coloured, came to the coach door begging. Marivaux,\r\nstruck with the contrast between the appearance and profession of\r\nthe man, looked out, and reproved him. \"Are you not ashamed,\"\r\nsaid he, \"a young fellow in perfect health and vigour, to have the\r\nmeanness to beg your bread, when you might procure it by honest\r\nlabour?\" The fellow, struck with this rebuke, was, at first,\r\nconfounded and silent; but presently afterwards, scratching his\r\nhead, exclaimed with a shrug and a sigh, \"_Ah! sir, if you did but\r\nknow--I am so lazy!_\" Marivaux, who was himself sensible of the pain\r\nof labour, was so pleased with the fellow's confession, that he gave\r\nhim a crown.\r\n\r\nFontenelle having heard that Marivaux was sick, and having just\r\nreason to fear that he, who never laid by any money, might be in\r\nwant of it at such an exigence, went to him, and when they were\r\nalone, told him his suspicions. \"Perhaps,\" says he, \"more money may\r\nbe convenient to you than you have by you.--Friends should never\r\nwait to be solicited; here is a purse with a hundred louis d'ors,\r\nwhich you must permit me to leave at your disposal.\"--\"I consider\r\nthem (said Marivaux) as received and used; permit me now to return\r\nthem with the gratitude that such a favour ought to excite.\"--\"What\r\nbenevolence and generosity, in one of these friends,\" says the\r\nauthor, \"what delicacy and greatness of mind in the other!\"\r\n\r\n  [_Nat. Gaz._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A curious phenomenon._--Extract of a letter dated May 4th, 1820,\r\nfrom a respectable physician of Northumberland, Pennsylvania, to an\r\neminent member of the faculty in this city.\r\n\r\n\"About twelve years ago the wife of the parish minister had twins.\r\nShe was a debilitated nervous woman. Her mother a healthy old lady\r\nof seventy-five, who firmly believed the prayers of the faithful\r\ncould remove mountains, began to think what a comfortable thing it\r\nwould be, if she could nurse one of the twins. The consequence was,\r\nthat her breasts filled with milk, and she nursed it for twelve\r\nmonths, affording all that time an abundant supply, to the great\r\nrelief of the mother.\r\n\r\n\"This story cannot be contradicted; for the most respectable persons\r\nin Northumberland have related it to me, persons who could not be\r\ndeceived, and would not deceive me. They say that she often carried\r\nthe child abroad in the course of her visiting, telling the wonder\r\nwherever she went, and giving her friends ocular demonstration of\r\nthe lactiferous miracle.\"\r\n\r\n  [_Ibid_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Works of Fiction._--Hannah More, in her last work, remarking on\r\nthe subject of \"unprofitable reading,\" observes, \"many works of\r\nfiction may be read with safety, some even with profit; But the\r\nconstant familiarity even with such as are not exceptionable in\r\nthemselves, relaxes the mind that wants hardening, dissolves the\r\nheart which wants fortifying, stirs the imagination which wants\r\nquieting, irritates the passions which want calming, and, above all,\r\ndisinclines and disqualifies for active virtues, and for spiritual\r\nexercises. The habitual indulgence in such reading is a silent,\r\nmining mischief. Though there is no act, and no moment, in which any\r\nopen assault on the mind is made, yet the constant habit performs\r\nthe work of a mental atrophy; it produces all the symptoms of decay,\r\nand the danger is not less for being more gradual, and, therefore,\r\nless suspected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENSBOROUGH, _(Pa.) May 5, 1820_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Law Case._--JACK VS. MAUNS.--The plaintiff brought suit against\r\ndefendant for a rifle gun, which defendant had exchanged for a\r\nhorse. The defendant insisted on the bargain being annulled, on\r\nthe ground of a special agreement, that if he did not like the\r\nhorse, he should be returned within a stipulated time. The cause\r\nwas referred to arbitrators, who awarded, that the plaintiff should\r\ntake back the horse, and the defendant his gun, the spectators pay\r\nthe drink, and the justice the cost of arbitrators. Judgment on the\r\naward--_parties satisfied_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH INQUISITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, and in the Pontificate\r\nof Innocent VIII. the Inquisition was established for the\r\nprosecution of heretics. It was originally intended to take\r\ncognizance of only the Jews and Moors--but so rapidly did it extend\r\nits influence, that during the sway of Torquemada, the first\r\nInquisitor-General, it was calculated that 6000 persons were burnt\r\nby his order; and upwards of 20,000 fell victims in various other\r\nways. From the above period to the present time, it is impossible\r\nto calculate the number of persons who have fallen victims to its\r\nhorrid cruelties. The late revolutions in Spain have abolished the\r\nInquisition, opened the doors of its prisons, and set the captives\r\nfree. This measure alone is a subject of the highest congratulation\r\nto the friends of freedom throughout the world.\r\n\r\n  [_N. Y. D. Adv._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ellery._--The venerable Mr. Ellery, the subject of the extract\r\nwhich we give below, was one of the signers of the Declaration\r\nof Independence, and upwards of ninety years old when he died.\r\nThe writer of the letter is a gentleman of Rhode Island, of much\r\ndistinction, who was intimately acquainted with the deceased.\r\n\r\n     _Extract of a letter, dated Newport, (R. I.) March 14, 1820_.\r\n\r\n\"Old Mr. Ellery died like a philosopher. In truth death, in its\r\ncommon form, never came near him. His strength wasted gradually for\r\nthe last year, until he had not enough left to draw in his breath,\r\nand so he ceased to breathe. The day on which he died, he got up and\r\ndressed himself, took his old flag-bottomed chair, without arms,\r\nin which he had sat for more than half a century, and was reading\r\nTully's Offices in the Latin without glasses, though the print was\r\nas fine as that of the smallest pocket Bible. Dr. W. stopped in on\r\nhis way to the Hospital, as he usually did; and on perceiving the\r\nold gentlemen could scarcely raise his eyelids to look at him, took\r\nhis hand, and found that his pulse was gone. After drinking a little\r\nwine and water, Dr. W. told him his pulse beat stronger. \"O yes,\r\nDoctor, I have a charming pulse. But,\" he continued, \"it is idle to\r\ntalk to me in this way. I am going off the stage of life, and it is\r\na great blessing that I go free from sickness, pain and sorrow.\"\r\nSome time after, his daughter, finding him become extremely weak,\r\nwished him to be put to bed, which he at first objected to, saying\r\nhe felt no pain, and there was no occasion for his going to bed.\r\nPresently after, however, fearing he might possibly fall out of his\r\nchair, he told them they might get him upright in the bed, so that\r\nhe could continue to read. They did so, and he continued reading\r\nCicero very quietly for some time; presently they looked at him and\r\nfound him dead, sitting in the same posture, with the book under his\r\nchin, as a man who becomes drowsy and goes to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n  _[National Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Benjamin West._--This distinguished American artist died in London\r\nat the advanced age of 82, being born on the 10th of October, 1738,\r\nin Chester county, Pennsylvania. His genius and industry as a\r\npainter have never been surpassed, and his productions will long be\r\nadmired for their great and unrivalled merit. He was much attached\r\nto his native country, and took great pleasure in conversing\r\nwith his fellow citizens, and giving every facility to American\r\nartists--he viewed our progress in arts and in science, with deep\r\ninterest, and his long absence did not alienate his affections from\r\nhis native land. \"Yesterday,\" said he to an American, \"was fifty\r\nyears since I first arrived in London--I remember travelling on\r\nthe top of the Canterbury coach, and stopping about two miles from\r\nLondon, at a mean tavern, and taking a dinner before I entered the\r\nmetropolis to seek my fortune; and I could not avoid yesterday going\r\nto the same tavern, calling for a dinner alone in the same room,\r\nlooking back on the fifty years I had spent, the progress I had made\r\nin my profession, the friends I possessed, and the adventures I had\r\nmet with.\" This was a singular epoch in the life of an individual.\r\n\r\n  [_Nat.

The feet demand\r\nshoes; the legs stockings; the rest of the body, clothing; and\r\nthe stomach a good deal of victuals. Our eyes, though exceedingly\r\nuseful, ask, when reasonable, only the cheap assistance of\r\nspectacles, which would not much impair our finances. But the eyes\r\nof _other people_ are the eyes that ruin us. If all but myself were\r\nblind, I should want neither fine clothes, fine house nor fine\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enormous Bird._--Mr. Henderson has discovered, in New Siberia, the\r\nclaws of a bird, measuring each a yard in length; and the Yaknts\r\nassured him they had frequently in their hunting excursions, met\r\nwith skeletons, and even feathers of this bird, the quills of which\r\nwere large enough to admit a man's arm. This is a fact in support of\r\nthe tradition, that the earth was formerly inhabited by giants, for\r\nmen, not exceeding ourselves in stature, would have been helpless\r\nagainst birds of prey of this magnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Martial glory._--In the Edinburgh Review of Dr. Seybert's\r\n\"Statistical Annals of the United States,\" there is an admonition\r\nto the Americans to abstain from martial glory. \"We can inform\r\nthem,\" (says the Reviewer) \"what are the inevitable consequences of\r\nbeing too fond of glory. Taxes upon every article which enters into\r\nthe mouth, or covers the back, or is placed under the foot--taxes\r\nupon every thing which is pleasant to see, hear, feel, smell, or\r\ntaste--taxes upon warmth, light, or locomotion--taxes on every thing\r\non earth, and the waters under the earth--of every thing that comes\r\nfrom abroad, or is grown at home--taxes on the raw material--taxes\r\non every fresh value that is added to it by the industry of\r\nmen--taxes on the sauce which pampers man's appetite, and the drug\r\nthat restores him to health--on the ermine which decorate the judge,\r\nand the rope which hangs the criminal--on the poor man's salt, and\r\nthe rich man's spice--on the brass nails of the coffin, and the\r\nribands of the bride--at bed or at board, couchant or levant, we\r\nmust pay! The school boy whips his taxed top--the beardless youth\r\nmanages his taxed horse with a taxed bridle on a taxed road; and\r\nthe dying Englishman, pouring his medicine which has paid seven per\r\ncent., into a spoon which has paid fifteen per cent., flings himself\r\nback upon his chintz bed, which has paid twenty-two per cent.--makes\r\nhis will on an 8l. stamp, and expires in the arms of an apothecary,\r\nwho has paid 100l. for the privilege of putting him to death.--His\r\nwhole property is then taxed from 2 to 10 per cent., besides the\r\nprobate. Large fees are demanded for burying him in the chancel; his\r\nvirtues are handed down to posterity on taxed marble; and he is then\r\ngathered to his fathers to be taxed no more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Law Intelligence.--R. & C. Rhodes, vs. Peleg Congdon._ The court\r\nare of opinion that the legal mode of computing interest, where\r\nthere have been partial payments, is, to cast the interest on the\r\nprincipal, up to the time of the first payment, which add to the\r\nprincipal; and from this sum deduct the payment, and so on through\r\nall the endorsements when one year or more intervenes between the\r\npayments, provided the sum paid is greater than the sum due for\r\ninterest, when the payment is made; if less than such sum is paid,\r\nto be applied towards the payment of interest; and where the note\r\nor mortgage has not run one year, then, cast the interest tin the\r\npayment, as well as the principal, up to the end of the year.--The\r\nabove decision was made by the Supreme Court, at their late April\r\nterm, in Kent, Maryland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Books._--Dr. Aikin in his valuable letters from a Father to a\r\nSon, thus elucidates the value of a Library:--\"Imagine (says he)\r\nthat we had it in our power to call up the shades of the greatest\r\nand wisest men that ever existed, and obliged them to converse with\r\nus on the most interesting topics--what an inestimable privilege\r\nshould we think it!--how superior to all common enjoyments! But in\r\na well furnished library we, in fact, possess this power. We can\r\nquestion Xenophon and Cæsar on their campaigns--make Demosthenes and\r\nCicero plead before us--join in the audiences of Socrates and Plato,\r\nand receive demonstrations from Euclid and Newton. In books we have\r\nthe choicest thoughts of the ablest men in their best dress. We can,\r\nat pleasure, exclude dulness and impertinence, and open our doors to\r\nwit and good sense alone. Without books, I have never been able to\r\npass a single day to my entire satisfaction; with them, no day has\r\nbeen so dark as not to have had its pleasure. Even pain and sickness\r\nhave for a time been charmed away by them. By the easy provision\r\nof a book in my pocket, I have frequently worn through long nights\r\nand days in the most disagreeable parts of my profession, with\r\nall the difference in my feelings between calm content and fretful\r\nimpatience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_European Literature._---The catalogue of the fair of Leipsic, for\r\n1819, contains one thousand two hundred and sixteen new works, in\r\nGreek, Latin, and German; thirty-eight novels, thirty dramatic\r\npieces, twenty-seven geographical maps, fifty-nine pieces of music;\r\nand seventy-seven works in foreign languages, the French, Italian,\r\nPolish, Bohemian, Danish, and Spanish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Egypt._--The last news from this country, of inexhaustible\r\ncuriosity, contains information respecting the labours of that\r\nmagnificent undertaking, the Grand Canal of Alexandria. Already\r\nthe primary effects of it have given an impulse to agriculture and\r\nindustry, such as might be expected from it. The culture of cotton,\r\nof the sugar cane, of the mulberry tree, is beginning to assume\r\na degree of activity, as also the rearing of silkworms; and some\r\nimportant new manufactories are already at work, holding out the\r\npromise of future commercial prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lakes in New Holland._--It appears that two large seas or sheets of\r\nwater have been discovered in the interior of New Holland, supplied\r\nchiefly by two considerable rivers, whose sources are on the western\r\nside of the Blue Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Missions in India._--The Reverend James Bryce, in a sermon\r\npreached in Calcutta, March, 1818, said, \"Zeal the most active and\r\ndisinterested, and diligence the most assiduous, have not been\r\nspared by the Christian missionary, in his pious attempts to convert\r\nthe natives of India. But, alas! it may be doubted, if at this day\r\nhe boasts a single proselyte to his creed, over whom he is warranted\r\nto rejoice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Increase of Taxes in England._--A meeting of the magistrates, and\r\nother owners and occupiers of land in Monmouthshire, was held lately\r\nat Abergavenny, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for\r\nrelief. The 1st clause of the petition states, \"That the farmer at\r\nthis time can obtain but little more for his corn than in the year\r\n1793, although the taxes are increased _four fold_, and the poors'\r\nrates above trebled, since that period.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_British Exports._--The exports of white and plain calicoes from\r\nGreat Britain, were--In 1814, 58,928,174 yards; in 1815, 65,669 930;\r\nin 1816, 50,251,102; and in 1817, 63,525,555.\r\n\r\n_Scull of king Robert the Bruce._--Lately in the church of\r\nDumfermline, the grave of the celebrated warrior king Robert the\r\nBruce was opened, in presence of a numerous assemblage of men of\r\nrank and science. The scull, and various parts of the skeleton,\r\nwere in a state of preservation: now that the opinions of Gall\r\nand Spurzheim are not passed over as mere pieces of quackery, the\r\ncuriosity of anatomists, and even of the public in general, was\r\nexcited by this invaluable opportunity of inspecting and examining\r\nsuch a scull as that of king Robert the Bruce. We are told, that\r\nseveral of the propensities of this great man, were strongly\r\nexpressed in the eminences of the scull--in particular, that the\r\norgan of _combativeness_ was the most prominent of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Power of Ice._--The following singular account of the power of ice,\r\nis taken from an English periodical publication, of January 1820.\r\n\r\n\"Huyghens, in order to try the force with which ice would expand\r\nitself when confined, filled a cannon, the sides of which were an\r\ninch thick, with water, and then closed the mouth and touch hole so\r\nthat none could escape. The instrument, thus filled was exposed in\r\na strong freezing air. In less than twelve hours the water within\r\nwas frozen, and began to dilate itself with such force, that it\r\nactually burst the piece in two different places. Mathematicians\r\nhave calculated the force of the ice on this occasion; such a\r\nforce, they say, would raise a weight of 27,730 pounds. From hence,\r\ntherefore, we need not be surprised at the effects of ice destroying\r\nthe substance of vegetables, trees, and even splitting rocks, when\r\nthe frost is carried to excess.\r\n\r\n\"The late frost produced quite a phenomenon at the back of the\r\nCold-Bath-Fields prison, where the New River Water Company's leading\r\niron pipes cross the Fleet Ditch. The pipes not having been properly\r\ncemented, or the cement having worn away, the water had spouted up\r\nhigh in the air: and when the very severe weather was, it commenced\r\nfreezing, and continued to freeze till a large cascade or fountain\r\nof ice was actually formed, as white as snow, about ten feet above\r\nthe pipe, and reaching in large icicles concocted together nearly\r\nto the water in the ditch below. The bank was covered with a thick\r\ncoat of ice from the spray, which blew from the water-fall. The\r\ncircumference of the frozen pile could not be less than eight or ten\r\nfeet, at half that height from the pipe. At a distance it was not\r\npossible to distinguish it from water spouting and falling down;\r\nand when close to it the ice looked so clear and beautiful, and the\r\nrarity of such an object being considered, made every one behold it\r\nwith wonder and admiration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ingenious Machine._--The National Fire and Life Insurance\r\nAssociation, (London) have introduced a newly invented machine,\r\nwhich possesses the following properties: In case of fire,\r\nit instantly awakens the party in whose sleeping room it is\r\nplaced--immediately lights a lamp--makes known the hour of the\r\nnight, and not only that a fire has commenced, but in what room.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chinese Superstition._--The following article, which gives some\r\nidea of Chinese superstition, is taken from a Peking Gazette:--\"The\r\n1st of May, 1818, there arose suddenly at Peking, a tempest, that\r\nobscured the heavens and filled the air with sand and dust. The\r\nEmperor, thinking it was a judgment from heaven, was very much\r\nalarmed, and very anxious to know what it meant: he assembled his\r\nministers of state, and commanded them to endeavour to discover the\r\ncause of it: he then reprimanded his astronomers for not having\r\nforetold it to him. 'You announced to me,' said he to them, 'three\r\ndays ago, the happy influence the stars had over me, foretelling a\r\nlong and prosperous life; this was mere flattery, while you either\r\nwould not or could not tell me of this impending misfortune.' Three\r\nof those _sages_ gave their opinion, that the cause of this tempest\r\nwas the dismissal of the late chief minister, _Sung Tajin_, and\r\nadvised him to recall him; but his Majesty, far from approving their\r\nproposal, reprimanded them for having the presumption to meddle with\r\nthe royal prerogative. The body of mathematicians gave in their\r\nopinion, assuring him that if this whirlwind, accompanied with dust,\r\ncontinued during the whole day, it indicated a perverse conduct and\r\nvariance of opinion between the sovereign and his ministers, as well\r\nas a great drought and famine. If the wind disturbed the sand, moved\r\nthe stones, and made much noise, inundations were to be expected;\r\nand if the dust continued to fall one hour more, the plague would\r\nrage in the southern regions, and half the inhabitants to the\r\nsoutheast would be sick.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gazette expresses his Majesty's uneasiness at this long drought.\r\nHis Majesty has ordered his sons to fast, to pray, and offer\r\nsacrifices to heaven, to earth, and to the god of wind. There was\r\nto be a solemn festival on the 25th of May, 1819, at which all\r\nthe princes, ministers, and nobles, were to appear in procession,\r\nwearing mourning as a mark of their contrition!\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Farmers' Wives._--A most excellent method of making BUTTER, is\r\nnow practised in England, which effectually prevents its changing\r\nand becoming rancid.--The day before churning, scald the cream in a\r\nclean iron kettle, over a clear fire, taking care that it does not\r\nboil over. As soon as it begins to boil, or is fully scalded, strain\r\nit, when the particles of milk, which tended to sour and change the\r\nbutter, are separated and left behind. Put the vessel into a tub of\r\nwater, in a cellar, till the next morning, when it will be ready\r\nfor churning, and become butter in less than quarter of the time\r\nrequired in the common method. It will also be hard, with peculiar\r\nadditional sweetness, and will not change. The labour in this way is\r\nless than the other, as the butter comes so much sooner, and saves\r\nso much time in working out the buttermilk.--By this method good\r\nbutter may be made in the hottest weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIED,\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the parish of Aiglish, in the vicinity of Killarney, Ireland, at\r\nthe very advanced age of _one hundred and fifteen years_, THEODORE\r\nO'SULLIVAN, the celebrated Irish Bard.--This extraordinary man,\r\nwho was a great composer in his native language, expired suddenly,\r\nin April last, whilst sowing oats in the field of his great grand\r\nchildren, and retaining his faculties to the last moment! He is said\r\nto have sung to the plough one of his favourite lyrics, and actually\r\nbreathed his last at the final stanza of his national melody. The\r\ndeceased also followed the occupation of a cooper, and is said to\r\nhave made a churn, from which butter was taken for the christening\r\nof his 26th great grand child.\r\n\r\nLately, at the hospital at Bourges, France, aged 103 years, and\r\n13 days, ETIENNE DELAMETAIRE. He was born blind, and employed for\r\nupwards of 60 years in turning a grindstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more disinterested our benevolence, the nearer we approach to\r\nthe gods, was the sentiment of a reflecting heathen, who lived at\r\na remote period of antiquity. Disinterested benevolence, though of\r\nrare occurrence, is nevertheless, to the honour of human nature,\r\nsometimes witnessed. 'When it is, the effect, like that produced\r\nby beholding an island of verdure in a sandy desert, or a retiring\r\nevergreen in the wintry waste, is in the highest degree cheering and\r\ndelightful. DAVID G. SEIXAS, a young man of this city, of limited\r\npecuniary resources, but of truly philanthropic and elevated views,\r\nhas for some time past gratuitously instructed a number of deaf and\r\ndumb children, with singular success. His unobtrusive merit has at\r\nlength in some measure become cognisant to the public; and as it\r\nis ascertained that there is a considerable number of unfortunate\r\nindividuals, of this description, in the city _and its vicinity_, an\r\nassociation has been formed, under the most respectable auspices,\r\nfor establishing an Institution for their instruction.[11] It is\r\nhoped and believed, that exertions to promote so excellent an\r\nobject, will be aided with ample and willing patronage.\r\n\r\n  [11] This truly laudable enterprise, as well as many others of a\r\n  similar character, (without derogating from the important services\r\n  of others,) is most essentially indebted to the enlightened zeal,\r\n  and public spirited benevolence of one of the Vice-Presidents,\r\n  ROBERTS VAUX, Esq.--The justice of this small tribute to\r\n  distinguished worth, although dictated by friendship, will be\r\n  cheerfully acknowledged by his fellow citizens generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEAF AND DUMB BOY!\r\n\r\n\r\n    When smiles play around thee, why sad and forlorn,\r\n    Amid all the transports thy fellows enjoy;\r\n    In life's cheerful morning what prompts thee to mourn?--\r\n    Alas! he is SILENT--poor sad-fated BOY!\r\n\r\n    When nature is robed in her mantle of green,\r\n    And winter has fled with his vapours & snows,\r\n    Every bough has its vocalist gladd'ning the scene,\r\n    He naught of this soul-cheering melody knows!\r\n\r\n    His ear never welcom'd the music of sound,\r\n    His tongue never utter'd the wonders of thought,\r\n    His DUTIES and END wrapt in darkness profound,\r\n    Have ne'er to this child of misfortune been taught.\r\n\r\n    Perchance ere the period when heart-rending woes,\r\n    To a premature grave had a fond mother brought,\r\n    As maternal affection more fervidly glows,\r\n    When our path through existence with sorrows is fraught!\r\n\r\n    Life's gath'ring ills were dispell'd by her smiles,\r\n    For love an inaudible language can speak;\r\n    But bereft of that friend who all suffering beguiles,\r\n    The tear of affliction now traces his cheek.\r\n\r\n    His wants disregarded, his wishes unknown,\r\n    Yet generous bosoms with sympathy feel,\r\n    When they make his condition--a moment their own,\r\n    His eloquent, silent, resistless appeal.\r\n\r\n    Though drear be his prospects, we view with delight,\r\n    His sorrowing features now bright'ning with joy,\r\n    For Mercy descending in vesture of white,\r\n    Will solace the SPEECHLESS AND DESTITUTE BOY.\r\n\r\n  E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITORS OF THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The following is a copy of Verses which I took from a manuscript\r\n     above forty years ago. I think them good, and as I have never\r\n     seen them in any printed book, I infer they are very rarely to\r\n     be met with.\r\n\r\n  From your friend and well-wisher,\r\n\r\n  _May_ 8, 1820.\r\n\r\n  C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nON MAN'S DEPENDANCE ON HIS CREATOR.\r\n\r\n    Through all the various shifting scenes\r\n      Of life's mistaken ill or good,\r\n    The hand of God conducts, unseen,\r\n      The beautiful vicissitude.\r\n\r\n    He portions with paternal care,\r\n      Howe'er unjustly we complain,\r\n    To each his necessary share\r\n      Of joy and sorrow, health and pain.\r\n\r\n    Trust we to youth, or friends, or power,\r\n      Fix we our foot on fortune's ball;\r\n    When most secure, the coming hour,\r\n      If he sees fit, can blast them all.\r\n\r\n    When lowest sunk with grief or shame,\r\n      Gorged with affliction's deepest cup,\r\n    Lost to relations, friends, or fame,\r\n      His powerful hand can raise thee up.\r\n\r\n    Before his throne the poor, opprest\r\n      With slanderous rage, acquitted stand;\r\n    He guides the exile to his rest,\r\n      And country, in a foreign land.\r\n\r\n    His powerful consolations cheer,\r\n      His smiles erect the afflicted head;\r\n    His hand can wipe away the tear\r\n      That secret wets the widow'd bed.\r\n\r\n    All things on earth, and all in heaven,\r\n      On his eternal will depend;\r\n    And all for greater good were given,\r\n      Would man pursue th' appointed end.\r\n\r\n    This be my care. To all beside,\r\n      Indifferent let my wishes be;\r\n    Passions be calm, and dumb be pride,\r\n      And fix'd my soul, my God, on thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITORS OF THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy leisure hours are mostly employed in holding a sort of literary\r\n_chit-chat_ with some favourite author or editor; but I am never\r\nmore agreeably entertained than at your _Evening Fire-side_, by\r\nthe various topics there introduced and discussed. The Essayist\r\n_remarks_ the pride, extravagance, and vices, which at present\r\nprevail, and _teaches_ us that these are unworthy of rational\r\nbeings, and that their opposites, humility, prudence, and virtue,\r\nwith the exercise of charity and forbearance, can alone ensure us\r\nfelicity. The Agriculturist descants on the improvement of the soil,\r\nthe rearing of flocks and herds, and the enviable pleasures of rural\r\noccupations. The Mechanic sets forth the superior advantages of some\r\nnew invention; while the man of science communicates the result of\r\ningenious experiments in the particular branches of knowledge which\r\nhave engaged his attention. And last, though not less a favourite\r\nthan the rest, is the Bard, whose title to poetic inspiration is not\r\nunfrequently evinced by his giving\r\n\r\n    ----\"_to airy nothing\r\n    \"A local habitation and a name_.\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus highly amused and instructed myself, I am unable, being\r\nof humble capacity, to contribute in return to the edification of\r\nothers, unless by occasionally communicating what I may chance to\r\nglean in the course of some of my _literary_ peregrinations. As this\r\nmay not be unacceptable, I send you, as a token of my good will, and\r\ndesire for the prosperity of your interesting Miscellany, a _scrap_\r\nof American poesy, which, though published a few years since in some\r\nof the public journals, it is believed will be new to many of your\r\nreaders. The writer is a young lady of Virginia, by the name of\r\nHENNING, who thus modestly speaks of a production, which, it must be\r\nadmitted, is alike creditable to herself, her sex and country:--\"The\r\nsubject which I have selected, has already employed the talents of\r\nan eminent poet, (_Akenside_,) and as he has gathered in the rich\r\nharvest which it presented to the sickle of his genius, I must, like\r\nRuth of old, be content to collect the scattered ears, not however\r\nexpecting the same result to my employment as that which attended my\r\nfair-famed predecessor.\"--Your friend,\r\n\r\n  X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nODE TO IMAGINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Oh thou! whose power inspires the minstrel's song.\r\n    And pours the tide of tuneful verse along,\r\n    Whose rapid wings through ether speed their flight,\r\n    While earth extended lies beneath thy sight,\r\n    Send one bright beam of that celestial blaze,\r\n    That round thy brow in dazzling lustre plays,\r\n    One ray, to gild the gloom of mental night,\r\n    And burst its shroud with thy refulgent light!\r\n\r\n    By thee each scene, that meets the gazing view,\r\n    Is cloth'd in beauty's bright attractive hue:\r\n    'Tis thine to wake the bold exalted thought,\r\n    With splendour graced, with mental ardour fraught;\r\n    The lofty strain of eloquence is thine,\r\n    By thee its torrent rolls, its beauties shine;\r\n    Thy power directs the mind's adventurous flight,\r\n    And guides its course to Grandeur's lofty height.\r\n\r\n    'Tis thine fair Beauty's brightest forms to trace,\r\n    Adorned with charms and rich in every grace,\r\n    By thee the painter's mimic canvas shows\r\n    A youthful form where each attraction glows;\r\n    By thee the eye its seeming lustre sheds,\r\n    By thee the rose the snowy cheek o'erspreads,\r\n    Till to the sight the lovely semblance seems\r\n    A living goddess, sung in fabled themes.\r\n\r\n    Nor does the strain whose headlong torrent falls,\r\n    While sounding echoes strike the lofty walls,\r\n    Nor Venus robed in heavenly charms alone,\r\n    The potent magic of thine influence own.\r\n    Oft have thy visions cheered the drooping breast,\r\n    By anguish pierced, by gloomy cares opprest,\r\n    A while suppressed the deep complaining sigh,\r\n    And wiped the tear from sorrow's streaming eye.\r\n\r\n    The lonely exile, forced afar to roam,\r\n    And leave for ever his lamented home,\r\n    Though foreign scenes to meet his view arise,\r\n    By thee transported, sees his native skies.\r\n    Each scene, that gave his youthful heart delight,\r\n    Again salutes his fond enraptured sight,\r\n    And Friendship's voice, which once he loved to hear,\r\n    In tender accents meets his listening ear.\r\n\r\n    But who can tell how wide thine influence reigns?\r\n    The weary captive, bound in galling chains,\r\n    Cheered by thy light, forgets his dungeon's gloom,\r\n    And seems to gaze on Nature's vernal bloom,\r\n    The leafy grove, the blue ethereal sky,\r\n    The flowery field, delight his wondering eye,\r\n    While Nature's music breathes its thrilling notes,\r\n    And on his ear in melting softness floats.\r\n\r\n    Fair Queen of Visions! I invoke thine aid,\r\n    Whose wondrous force, what strain has e'er display'd?\r\n    For who can trace thy wild eccentric course,\r\n    Or paint of mental light the lovely source?\r\n    As well might Art with feeble skill essay\r\n    To paint the warm enlivening orb of day,\r\n    With mimic hues its sparkling beams to light,\r\n    And pour its radiance on the aching sight!\r\n\r\n    E'en though I gained that mountain's fabled height,\r\n    Where Music breathes the soul of warm delight,\r\n    I'd ask not power thy wondrous might to sing,\r\n    So far beyond my thought's sublimest spring,\r\n    But send one beam of that celestial blaze,\r\n    That round thy brow in dazzling lustre plays,\r\n    One ray to gild the gloom of mental night,\r\n    And burst its shroud with thy refulgent light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INVOCATION TO POVERTY.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES JAMES FOX, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Oh, Poverty! of pale, consumptive hue,\r\n    If thou delight'st to haunt me still in view;\r\n    If still thy presence must my steps attend,\r\n    At least continue as thou art--my friend!\r\n    Whene'er example bids me be unjust,\r\n    False to my word--or faithless to my trust;\r\n    Bid me the baneful error quickly see,\r\n    And shun the world, to find repose in thee:\r\n    When vice to wealth would turn my partial eye,\r\n    Or interest shut my ear to sorrow's cry,\r\n    Or courtiers' custom would my reason bend,\r\n    My foe to flatter--or desert my friend;\r\n    Oppose, kind Poverty, thy tempered shield,\r\n    And bear me off unvanquished from the field.\r\n      If giddy Fortune e'er return again,\r\n    With all her idle, restless, wanton train;\r\n    Her magic glass should false Ambition hold;\r\n    Or Avarice bid me put my trust in gold;\r\n    To my relief, thou virtuous goddess, haste,\r\n    And with thee bring thy daughters ever chaste,\r\n    Health!

You\r\nwill recollect the terms of subscription. We were now to receive\r\nthe first year's payment--THREE dollars; and annually, from this\r\ntime, the same sum. Your punctuality will confer on us an additional\r\nfavour, and afford a criterion by which we may, in part, judge of\r\nour future support.\r\n\r\nWe contemplate no material alteration in our plan. In the first part\r\nof each number we shall present you, as heretofore, with essays of\r\ndifferent kinds; in the second, with agricultural subjects; and in\r\nthe third, or last division, with a miscellany made up of every\r\nvariety that presents.\r\n\r\nOur present list of subscribers is about what we had anticipated,\r\nbut is not yet sufficiently large. We calculate, however, before the\r\nclose of the year, to see it so increased as to support us in our\r\nhope of success. This will, in some measure, depend on those who\r\nhave seen and desire the continuance of the work. Could each of you\r\nprocure among your neighbours two or three, or even one additional\r\nsubscriber, our purpose would be answered. We therefore request\r\nyour assistance in this way, and enclose a subscription paper.\r\nSubscribers will be expected to take the numbers from the beginning\r\nof the year. A complete index and title-page will be furnished for\r\neach volume.\r\n\r\nRICHARDS & CALEB JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA,\r\n\r\n  PUBLISHED MONTHLY BY\r\n  RICHARDS & CALEB JOHNSON,\r\n  _No. 31, Market Street_,\r\n  At $3.00 per annum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGRIGGS & DICKENSON, _Printers--Whitehall_.",
