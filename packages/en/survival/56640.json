B. FORD AND COMPANY.\r\n  1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873,\r\n  BY J. B. FORD AND COMPANY,\r\n  in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.\r\n\r\n  UNIVERSITY PRESS: WELCH, BIGELOW, & CO.,\r\n  CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Preface to the first edition of this volume, which follows these\r\nfew words, will give some idea of the book’s origin. Much of the\r\nmaterial is of only passing importance, and is retained now rather\r\nfrom retrospective interest. A considerable addition has been made,\r\nhowever, consisting of articles contributed to Mr. Bonner’s _New York\r\nLedger_, bearing upon rural affairs, and also an unpublished address\r\nupon _The Apple_. This was delivered at Iona Island, on a fair summer\r\nday, when ladies and gentlemen, several score,—editors, pomologists,\r\nsingers, preachers, poets, and inventors,—gathered under Dr. C. W.\r\nGrant’s hospitable trees,—for the house was too small to hold them,—to\r\neat apples and pears, to discuss grapes solid and liquid, and to\r\nlisten to the venerable poet, Mr. Bryant, to Horace Greeley, to\r\nCharles Downing, and to notable songsters, whose warbles put the birds\r\nto envious silence,—at any rate, so the compliments ran at the time.\r\n\r\nThe address had better luck at Iona than its great subject did in\r\nParadise; though it will never give rise to such a literature of\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n                   H. W. BEECHER.\r\n\r\nBROOKLYN, February, 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one of our readers will be half so curious to know what this book\r\ncontains as the author himself. For it is more than twelve years since\r\nthese pieces were begun, and it is more than ten years since we have\r\nlooked at them. The publishers have taken the trouble to dig them out\r\nfrom what we supposed to be their lasting burial-place, in the columns\r\nof the _Western Farmer and Gardener_, and they have gone through the\r\npress without our own revision.\r\n\r\nIt is now twenty years since we settled at Indianapolis, the capital\r\nof Indiana, a place then of _four_, and now of _twenty-five_ thousand\r\ninhabitants. At that time, and for years afterward, there was not,\r\nwithin our knowledge, any other than political newspapers in the\r\nState—no educational journals, no agricultural or family papers. The\r\n_Indiana Journal_ at length proposed to introduce an agricultural\r\ndepartment, the matter of which should every month be printed, in\r\nmagazine form, under the title, _Indiana Farmer and Gardener_, which\r\nwas afterward changed to the more comprehensive title, _Western Farmer\r\nand Gardener_.\r\n\r\nIt may be of some service to the young, as showing how valuable the\r\nfragments of time may become, if mention is made of the way in which\r\nwe became prepared to edit this journal.\r\n\r\nThe continued taxation of daily preaching, extending through months,\r\nand once through eighteen consecutive months, without the exception of\r\na single day, began to wear upon the nerves, and made it necessary for\r\nus to seek some relaxation. Accordingly we used, after each\r\nweeknight’s preaching, to drive the sermon out of our heads by some\r\nalterative reading.\r\n\r\nIn the State Library were Loudon’s works—his encyclopedias of\r\nHorticulture, of Agriculture, and of Architecture. We fell upon them,\r\nand, for years, almost monopolized them.\r\n\r\nIn our little one-story cottage, after the day’s work was done, we\r\npored over these monuments of an almost incredible industry, and read,\r\nwe suppose, not only every line, but much of it many times over;\r\nuntil, at length, we had a topographical knowledge of many of the fine\r\nEnglish estates quite as intimate, we dare say, as was possessed by\r\nmany of their truant owners. There was something exceedingly pleasant,\r\nand is yet, in the studying over mere catalogues of flowers, trees,\r\nfruits, etc.\r\n\r\nA seedsman’s list, a nurseryman’s catalogue, are more fascinating to\r\nus than any story. In this way, through several years, we gradually\r\naccumulated materials and became familiar with facts and principles,\r\nwhich paved the way for our editorial labors. Lindley’s Horticulture\r\nand Gray’s Structural Botany came in as constant companions. And when,\r\nat length, through a friend’s liberality, we became the recipients of\r\nthe _London Gardener’s Chronicle_, edited by Prof. Lindley, our\r\ntreasures were inestimable. Many hundred times have we lain awake for\r\nhours, unable to throw off the excitement of preaching, and beguiling\r\nthe time with imaginary visits to the Chiswick Garden, to the more\r\nthan oriental magnificence of the Duke of Devonshire’s grounds at\r\nChatsworth. We have had long discussions, in that little bedroom at\r\nIndianapolis, with Van Mons about pears, with Vibert about roses, with\r\nThompson and Knight of fruits and theories of vegetable life, and with\r\nLoudon about everything under the heavens in the horticultural world.\r\n\r\nThis employment of waste hours not only answered a purpose of soothing\r\nexcited nerves then, but brought us into such relations to the\r\nmaterial world, that, we speak with entire moderation, when we say\r\nthat all the estates of the richest duke in England could not have\r\ngiven us half the pleasure which we have derived from pastures,\r\nwaysides, and unoccupied prairies.\r\n\r\nIf, when the readers of this book shall have finished it, they shall\r\nsay, that these papers, well enough for the circumstances in which\r\nthey originally appeared, have no such merit as to justify their\r\nrepublication in a book form, we beg leave to tell them that their\r\njudgment is not original. It is just what we thought ourselves! But\r\nPublishers are willful and must be obeyed!\r\n\r\n  BROOKLYN, June 1, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                PAGE\r\n\r\n  Political Economy of the Apple                   1\r\n  A few Flowers easily raised                     16\r\n  Flower-Farming                                  21\r\n  A Letter from the Farm                          25\r\n  The Cost of Flowers                             28\r\n  Haying                                          31\r\n  The Value of Robins                             34\r\n  Sounds of Trees                                 39\r\n  Unveiled Nonsense                               43\r\n  Natural Order of Flowers                        46\r\n  Roses                                           49\r\n  Chestnuts                                       51\r\n  Green Peas                                      55\r\n  Hens                                            58\r\n  Farming                                         60\r\n  Gardening under Difficulties                    63\r\n  Corn                                            66\r\n  Dandelions                                      69\r\n  How to beautify Homes                           72\r\n  Birch and Aspen                                 75\r\n  Autumn                                          78\r\n  Plant Trees!                                    81\r\n  Farewell to “Summer Rest”                       84\r\n  Preliminary                                     87\r\n  Our Creed                                       88\r\n  Almanac for the Year                            89\r\n  Educated Farmers                                98\r\n  An Acre of Words about Aker                    101\r\n  Farmer’s Library                               105\r\n  Nine Mistakes                                  107\r\n  Agricultural Societies                         108\r\n  Shiftless Tricks                               111\r\n  Electro Culture                                114\r\n  Single-Crop Farming                            117\r\n  Improved Breeds of Hogs and Cattle             119\r\n  Absorbent Qualities of Flour                   122\r\n  Portrait of an Anti-Book Farmer                124\r\n  Good Breeds of Cows                            128\r\n  Cutting and curing Grass                       131\r\n  Country and City                               133\r\n  Lime upon Wheat                                134\r\n  Culture of Hops                                136\r\n  White Clover                                   138\r\n  Plowing Corn                                   139\r\n  Clean out your Cellars                         142\r\n  When is Haying over?

The name was\r\nborrowed from across the water, by Dr. C. W. Grant’s father-in-law,\r\nwho owned this gem,—for gem it was and is for those who love rocks,\r\nglades, fine old trees, and absolute seclusion.\r\n\r\nBut who ever would have thought of such a place for vineyards? Yet,\r\nIona became the very Jerusalem of grape-vines. Dr. C. W. Grant,\r\nformerly of Newburgh, purchased the island, and, adopting the then new\r\ngrape,—the Delaware,—commenced propagating it for commercial purposes.\r\nIt may be fairly said that no man in America ever gave to grape\r\nculture a greater impulse than Dr. Grant. Abundant sales at length\r\nbrought in abundant revenues. But his ideas expanded with his means,\r\nand outran them.\r\n\r\nThe island was to become another Paradise. Here the magnolia was to be\r\npropagated in such numbers that every man in America could have it in\r\nhis yard, holding white cups filled with perfume to his windows. The\r\nrhododendron was to be sent forth to every farm. New grapes were\r\noriginated. Every year developed its own marvel. But whether it was\r\npear, Downing’s mulberry, grape, or ornamental tree, the good\r\ndemocratic heart of Dr. Grant intended no narrower field than the\r\ncontinent. Men were to be raised to a higher level by familiarity with\r\nbetter and better grapes. The taste was to be refined. Every creature\r\nunder the western heavens was to sit under his own grape-vine, and not\r\nunder one alone, but a whole vineyard of them.\r\n\r\nHealth failed. Business got tangled. The kind doctor sold out. He is\r\ngone from his vineyards. The island remains. One of these days, in the\r\nhands of some one who unites taste and thrift with abundant means, it\r\nwill become a marvel of beauty.\r\n\r\nBut it will hardly have a pleasanter day than when, in 1864, were\r\ngathered there two score or more of ladies and gentlemen,—not a few of\r\nthem famous in art, in literature, in music, in pomology, and in\r\nsanguine plans of fruit culture,—for a good time. Among the\r\ncontributions to the general amusement, I was appointed Orator to\r\ndiscourse upon _The Apple_, and the address was to have been\r\npublished, together with minutes of the proceedings, other speeches,\r\nand various interesting matter. But years passed on without progress\r\ntoward publication. What has become of other things I know not, but\r\nthis apple-talk has been fished up and saved. I fear it will never\r\nagain be as fresh or as powerful as in its first estate. For there now\r\nhangs upon my cellar wall a huge pan, lacking but a few inches of\r\nthree feet in diameter, upon which the ladies who had heard the\r\naddress established and perfected an apple-pie,—sent to me for New\r\nYear’s Day of 1865,—of so rare a spirit that every one of the hundreds\r\nwho tasted it declared it to be as good as it was large. Alas! the pan\r\nremains, and the poetry which came singing its merits; but the\r\npie,—where is it? So, too, the island of the Hudson stands secure; but\r\nwhere are the joyous people that thronged it on that autumn day?]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nI am to discourse of the apple to an audience, many of whom know much\r\nmore about it than I do, and all of them full as much. It does not, on\r\nthat account, follow that I should not speak. What a terrible blow\r\nwould fall upon all professions if a teacher should be forbidden to\r\nspeak upon things of which he knew nothing, and to an audience who\r\nknew more about them than he! One large part of the duty of a teacher\r\nis to remind his hearers of how much they know, and tempt them to a\r\nbetter use of their knowledge. Instruction is one thing, and important\r\nin its place; but the inspiration of men to a good use of the things\r\nthat they already know is far more needed.\r\n\r\nWhile the character of the ladies and gentlemen present makes it\r\nproper for me to hide, with due modesty, my knowledge of the apple in\r\nthe department of culture, there is what may be called the _Political\r\nEconomy of the Apple_, by which I mean the apple in its relation to\r\ndomestic comfort and commerce; and on that subject I think I can\r\nspeak, if not to edification, at least without fear of being tracked\r\nand cornered.\r\n\r\nThe apple is, beyond all question, _the_ American fruit. It stands\r\nabsolutely alone and unapproachable, grapes notwithstanding.\r\nOriginating in another hemisphere, neither in its own country, nor in\r\nany other to which it has been introduced, has it flourished as in\r\nAmerica. It is conceded in Europe that, for size, soundness, flavor,\r\nand brilliancy of coloring, the American apple stands first,—a long\r\nway first.\r\n\r\nBut it is American in another sense. This is a land in which diffusion\r\nis the great law. This arises from our institutions, and from the\r\ncharacter which they have imprinted upon our people. In Europe,\r\ncertain classes, having by their intelligence and wealth and influence\r\nthe power to attract all things to themselves, set the current from\r\nthe center toward the surface. In America, the simple doctrines that\r\nthe common people are the true source of political power, that the\r\ngovernment is directly responsible to them, and therefore that moral\r\nculture, intelligence, and training in politics are indispensable to\r\nthe common people, on whom every state is to rest safely, have wrought\r\nout such results that in all departments of justice and truth, as much\r\nas in politics, there is a tendency toward the popularizing of\r\neverything, and learning, or art, or any department of culture, is\r\nmade to feel the need of popularity; a word which is very much\r\ndespised by classicists, but which may be used in a sense so large as\r\nto make it respectable again. Things that reach after the universal,\r\nthat include in them all men in their better and nobler nature, are in\r\na proper sense _popular_; and in this country, amusement and\r\nrefinement and wealth itself, first or last, are obliged to do homage\r\nto the common people, and so to be _popular_. Nor is it otherwise in\r\nrespect to horticulture. Of fruits, I think this, above all others,\r\nmay be called the true democratic fruit. There is some democracy that\r\nI think must have sprung from the first apple. Of all fruits, no other\r\ncan pretend to vie with the apple as the fruit of the common people.\r\nThis arises from the nature of the tree and from the nature of the\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the tree. It is so easy of propagation, that any man who\r\nis capable of learning how to raise a crop of corn can learn how to\r\nplant, graft or bud, transplant, and prune an apple-tree,—and then eat\r\nthe apples. It is a thoroughly healthy and hardy tree; and that under\r\nmore conditions and under greater varieties of stress than perhaps any\r\nother tree. It is neither dainty nor dyspeptic. It can bear high\r\nfeeding and put up with low feeding. It is not subject to gout and\r\nscrofula, as plums are; to eruptions and ruptures, as the cherry is;\r\nor to apoplexy, as the pear is. The apple-tree may be pampered, and\r\nmay be rendered effeminate in a degree; but this is by artificial\r\nperversion. It is naturally tough as an Indian, patient as an ox, and\r\nfruitful as the Jewish Rachel. The apple-tree is among trees what the\r\ncow is among domestic animals in northern zones, or what the camel of\r\nthe Bedouin is.\r\n\r\nAnd, like all thoroughly good-natured, obliging, patient things, it is\r\nhomely. For beauty is generally unfavorable to good dispositions. (I\r\nam talking to the ladies now.) There seems to be some dissent; but\r\nthis is the orthodox view. It seems as if the evil incident to human\r\nnature had struck in, with handsome people, leaving the surface fair;\r\nwhile the homely are so because the virtue within has purged and\r\nexpelled the evil, and driven it to the skin. Have you never seen a\r\nmaiden that lovers avoided because she was not comely, who became,\r\nnevertheless, and perhaps on that account, the good angel of the\r\nhouse, the natural intercessor for afflicted children, the one to stay\r\nwith the lonely when all the gay had gone a-gadding after pleasure,\r\nthe soft-handed nurse, the story-teller and the book-reader to the\r\nwhole brood of eager eyes and hungry ears in the nursery; in short,\r\nthe child’s ideal of endless good-nature, self-sacrifice, and\r\nintercessorship, the Virgin Mary of the household,—mother of God to\r\ntheir love, in that she brings down to them the brightest conceptions\r\nof what God may peradventure be? And yet, such are stigmatized _old\r\nmaids_, though more fruitful of everything that is good (except\r\nchildren) than all others. One fault only do we find with them,—that\r\nthey are in danger of perverting our taste, and leading us to call\r\nhomeliness beautiful. All this digression, ladies and gentlemen, is on\r\naccount of my dear Aunt Esther, who brought me up,—a woman so good and\r\nmodest that she will spend ages in heaven wondering how it happened\r\nthat she ever got there, and that the angels will always be wondering\r\nwhy she was not there from all eternity.\r\n\r\nI have said, with some digressions, that the apple-tree is homely; but\r\nit is also hardy, and not only in respect to climate. It is almost\r\nindifferent to soil and exposure. We should as soon think of coddling\r\nan oak-tree or a chestnut; we should as soon think of shielding from\r\nthe winter white pine or hemlock, as an apple-tree. If there is a lot\r\ntoo steep for the plow or two rocky for tools, the farmer dedicates it\r\nto an apple orchard. Nor do the trees betray his trust. Yet, the apple\r\nloves the meadows. It will thrive in sandy loams, and adapt itself to\r\nthe toughest clay. It will bear as much dryness as a mullein stalk,\r\nand as much wet, almost, as a willow. In short, it is a genuine\r\ndemocrat. It can be poor, while it loves to be rich; it can be plain,\r\nalthough it prefers to be ornate; it can be neglected, notwithstanding\r\nit welcomes attention. But, whether neglected, abused, or abandoned,\r\nit is able to take care of itself, and to be fruitful of excellences.\r\nThat is what I call being democratic.\r\n\r\nThe apple-tree is the common people’s tree, moreover, because it is\r\nthe child of every latitude and every longitude on this continent. It\r\nwill grow in Canada and Maine. It will thrive in Florida and Mexico.\r\nIt does well on the Atlantic slope; and on the Pacific the apple is\r\nportentous. Newton sat in an orchard, and an apple, plumping down on\r\nhis head, started a train of thought which opened the heavens to us.\r\nHad it been in California, the size of the apples there would have\r\nsaved him the trouble of much thinking thereafter, perhaps, opening\r\nthe heavens to him, and not to us. Wherever Indian corn will grow, the\r\napple will thrive; and wherever timothy-grass will ripen its seed, the\r\napple will exist fruitfully.\r\n\r\nNor is the tree unworthy of special mention on account of health and\r\nlongevity. It is subject to fewer diseases than almost any tree of our\r\ncountry. The worms that infest it are more easily destroyed than those\r\nupon the currant or the rose. The leaf is subject to blight in so\r\nsmall a degree, that not one farmer in a hundred ever thinks of it.\r\nThe trunk is seldom winter-killed. It never cracks. It has no trouble,\r\nas the cherry does, in unbuckling the old bark and getting rid of it.\r\nThe borer is the only important enemy; and even this is a trifle, if\r\nyou compare the labor required to destroy it with the pains which men\r\nwillingly take to secure a crop of potatoes. Acre for acre, an apple\r\norchard will, on an average of years, produce more than half as many\r\nbushels of fruit as a potato-field,—will it not? And yet, in plowing\r\nand planting and after-plowing and hoeing and digging, the potato\r\nrequires at least five times the annual labor which is needed by the\r\napple. An acre of apple-trees can be kept clean of all enemies and\r\ndiseases with half the labor of once hoeing a crop of potatoes. And if\r\nyou have borers it is your own fault, and you ought to be bored!\r\n\r\nThe health of the apple-tree is so great that farmers never think of\r\nexamining their orchards for disease, any more than they do cedar\r\nposts or chestnut rails. And the great longevity of the apple-tree\r\nattests its good constitution. Two hundred years it sometimes reaches.\r\nI have a tree on my own place in Peekskill that cannot be less than\r\nthat. Two ladies, one about eighty years of age, called upon us about\r\nthree years ago, saying that they were brought up on that farm, and\r\ninquiring if the old apple-tree yet lived. They said that in their\r\nchildhood it was called _the old apple-tree_, and was then a\r\npatriarch. It must now be a Methuselah. And, not to recur to it again,\r\nI may say that it is probably the largest _recorded_ apple-tree of the\r\nworld. I read in no work of any tree whose circumference is greater\r\nthan twelve or thirteen feet. This morning I measured the Peekskill\r\napple-tree, and found that six inches above the ground it was fourteen\r\nfeet and six inches, and, at about four feet, or the spring of the\r\nlimbs, fourteen feet and ten inches. I am sorry to add that the\r\nlong-suffering old tree gives unmistakable signs of yielding to the\r\ninfirmities of age. The fruit is sweet, but not especially valuable,\r\nexcept for stock. I do not expect to live to see any of my other trees\r\nattain to the size and age of this solitary lingerer of other\r\ncenturies! I cannot help reverencing a tree whose leaves have trembled\r\nto the cannonading of the guns of our Revolution, which yielded fruit\r\nto Putnam’s soldiers when that hill was a military post, and under\r\nwhose shadow Washington himself—without any stretch of probability—may\r\nhave walked.\r\n\r\nI ought not to omit the good properties of the apple-tree for fuel and\r\ncabinet-work. I have for five autumns kept up the bright fire required\r\nby the weather in an old-fashioned Franklin fireplace, using\r\napple-wood, procured from old trees pruned or cut up wholly; and, when\r\nit is seasoned, I esteem it nearly as good as hickory, fully as good\r\nas maple, and far better than seasoned beech. I have also for my best\r\nbureau one of apple-wood. It might be mistaken for cherry. It is\r\nfine-grained, very hard, solid as mahogany, and grows richer with\r\nevery year of age.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the streets and roads are often shaded by fruit trees, the\r\nmulberry and the cherry being preferred. In some parts, the public are\r\nallowed to help themselves freely. When the fruit of any tree is to be\r\nreserved, a wisp of straw is placed around it, which suffices.\r\nUpright-growing apple-trees might be employed, with pears and\r\ncherries, in our streets and roads, and by their very number, and\r\ntheir abundance of fruit, might be taken away one motive of pilfering\r\nfrom juvenile hands. He must be a preordained thief who will go miles\r\nto steal that which he can get in broad daylight, without reproach, by\r\nhis door. One way to stop stealing is to give folks enough without it.\r\n\r\nI have thus far spoken of the apple _tree_. I now pass to the\r\n_fruit_,—to the apple itself. The question whether it sprang from the\r\nwild crab I do not regard as yet settled. It is not known from any\r\nhistorical evidence to have had that origin. You cannot prove that\r\nthis, that, or the other man, of any age or nation, planted the seed\r\nand brought forward the fruit. Nor am I aware that any man has\r\nconducted experiments on it like those of Van Mons on the pear, or\r\nthose which Dr. Grant has made on the grape that is cultivated in this\r\ncountry, to show that it sprang from the wild grape of Europe. Until\r\nthat is done, it will be only a theory, a probable fact, but not a\r\nfact proved. And, by the way, it might be worth some man’s while, at\r\nhis leisure, to take the seeds of the American wild grape, and see if,\r\nby any horticultural Sunday school, he can work them up into good\r\nChristian vines.\r\n\r\nThe apple comes nearer to universal uses than any other fruit of the\r\nworld. Is there another that has such a range of season? It begins in\r\nJuly, and a good cellar brings the apple round into July again, yet\r\nunshrunk, and in good flavor. It belts the year. What other fruit,\r\nexcept in the tropics, where there is no winter, and where there are\r\nsuccessive growths, can do that?\r\n\r\nIt is a luxury, too. Kinds may be had so tender, so delicate, and, as\r\nDr. Grant—the General Grant of the vineyards—would say, _so\r\nrefreshing_, that not the pear, even, would dare to vie with it, or\r\nhope to surpass it. The Vanderveer of the Hudson River, the American\r\nGolden Russet, need not, in good seasons, well ripened, fear a\r\nregiment of pears in pomological convention, even in the city of\r\nBoston. It may not rival the melting qualities of the peach, eating\r\nwhich one knows not whether he is eating or drinking. But the peach is\r\nthe fruit of a day,—ephemeral; and it is doubtful whether one would\r\ncarry through the year any such relish as is experienced for a few\r\nweeks. It is the peculiarity of the apple that it never wearies the\r\ntaste. It is to fruit what wheaten bread is to grains. It is a\r\nlife-long relish. You may be satisfied with apples, but never cloyed.\r\nDo you remember your boyhood feats? I was brought up in a great\r\nold-fashioned house, with a cellar under every inch of it, through\r\nwhich an ox-cart might have been wheeled after all the bins were full.\r\nIn this cellar, besides potatoes, beets, and turnips, were stored\r\nevery year some hundred bushels of apples,—the Rhode Island Greening,\r\nthe Roxbury Russet, the _Russet round the Stem_, as it was called, and\r\nthe Spitzenberg; not daintily picked, but shaken down; not in\r\naristocratic barrels set up in rows, but ox-carts full; not handled\r\nsoftly, but poured from baskets into great bins, as we poured potatoes\r\ninto their resting-place. If they bruised and rotted, let them. We had\r\nenough and to spare. Two seasons of picking over apples—a sort of\r\ngrand assizes—put the matter all right. In all my boyhood I never\r\ndreamed of apples as things possible to be stolen. So abundant were\r\nthey, so absolutely open to all comers,—who went down into the cellar\r\nby the inside stairs instead of the outside steps,—that we should as\r\nsoon have thought of being cautioned against taking turnips, or asking\r\nleave to take a potato. Apples were as common as air. And that was\r\nearly in December and January; for I noticed that the sun was no more\r\nfond than I was of staying out a great while on those Litchfield\r\nhills, but ran in early to warm his fingers, as I did mine. When the\r\nday was done, and the candles were lighted, and the supper was out of\r\nthe way, we all gathered about the great kitchen fire; and soon after\r\nGeorge or Henry had to go down for apples. Generally it was Henry. A\r\nboy’s hat is a universal instrument. It is a bat to smack butterflies\r\nwith, a bag to fetch berries in, a basket for stones to pelt frogs\r\nwithal, a measure to bring up apples in. And a big-headed boy’s old\r\nfelt hat was not stingy in its quantities; and when its store ended,\r\nthe errand could always be repeated. To eat six, eight, and twelve\r\napples in an evening was no great feat for a growing young lad, whose\r\nstomach was no more in danger of dyspepsia than the neighborhood mill,\r\nthrough whose body passed thousands of bushels of corn, leaving it no\r\nfatter at the end of the year than at the beginning. Cloyed with\r\napples? To eat an apple is to want to eat another. We tire of\r\ncherries, of peaches, of strawberries, of figs, of grapes, (I say it\r\nwith reverence in this presence!) but never of apples. Nay, when\r\ncreature comforts fail, and the heart—hopeless voyager on the troubled\r\nsea of life—is sick, apples are comforters; or, wherefore is it\r\nwritten:—\r\n\r\n“As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among\r\nthe sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his\r\nfruit was sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house,\r\nand his banner over me was love. Stay me with flagons,”—undoubtedly of\r\ncider!—“comfort me with apples; for I am sick of love.”\r\n\r\nIf this is the cure of love, we may the better understand why the\r\npopular instinct should have resorted to the apple-tree as a cure for\r\nambition, singing,\r\n\r\n  “We’ll hang Jeff Davis on a sour-apple tree.”\r\n\r\nThere is, in this toothsomeness of the apple, together with its utter\r\nharmlessness, a provision for nurses and mothers. There is a growing\r\nperiod when children are voracious. They must be filled; and it is a\r\nmatter of great account to know what to fill them with. If you give\r\nthem but bread, that seems meager. Pies, cakes, and sweetmeats are\r\nmischievous; and yet more so are candies and confections. Apples just\r\nhit the mark. They are more than a necessary of life, and less than a\r\nluxury. They stand just half-way between bread and cake, as wholesome\r\nas one and as good as the other.\r\n\r\nBut now I enter upon the realm of uses, culinary and domestic, where,\r\nwere I an ancient poet, I should stop and invoke all the gods to my\r\naid. But the gods are all gone; and next to them is that blessing of\r\nthe world, the housewife. Her I invoke, and chiefly one who taught me,\r\nby her kitchen magic, to believe that the germ of civilization is in\r\nthe art and science of the kitchen. Is there, among fruits, one other\r\nthat has so wide a range, or a range so important, so exquisite, so\r\nwonderful, as the range of the apple in the kitchen?\r\n\r\nFirst, consider it as a fruit-vegetable. It might with great advantage\r\ntake its place upon the table as regularly as the potato or the onion.\r\nFar more odorous is the onion, but, I think, far more blessed is the\r\napple. It is an admirable accompaniment of meat, which always craves a\r\npiquant acid for relish. And when meat is wanting, a scrap of pork in\r\nthe frying-pan, with sliced apples, will serve the economic table\r\nalmost as well as if it had been carved from a beef or cut from a\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nWe do not use the apple enough in our cooking. As a fruit upon the\r\ntable it may be used for breakfast, for supper, for dessert. Roasted\r\napples! Baked apples! What visions come before my mind! Not the baked\r\napples of the modern stove, which has humbled their glory. They are\r\nstill worth eating, but they have lost the stature, the comeliness,\r\nand the romance of the old roasted apples, that were placed in due\r\norder between the huge andirons, and turned duly by the careful\r\nservant, drinking in heat on one side and oxygen on the other, and\r\ncoming to a degree of luxurious nicety that will never be attained\r\ntill we go back again to the old fireplace. It was a real pleasure to\r\nbe sick,—I mean on the hither border of sickness; so that we might not\r\ngo to school, and so that, while we took a little magnesia, we might\r\nfeast on delicious roasted apples. And as for baked apples and milk,\r\nhow can I adequately speak of that most excellent dish!\r\n\r\nThen, again, the apple may be regarded as a confection, serving in the\r\nform of tarts, pies,—blessed be the unknown person who invented the\r\napple-pie! Did I know where the grave of that person was, methinks I\r\nwould make a devout pilgrimage thither, and rear a monument over it\r\nthat should mark the spot to the latest generations. Of all pies, of\r\nevery name, the apple-pie is easily the first and chief. And what\r\nshall I say of jellies, dumplings, puddings, and various preserves,\r\nthat are made from the apple?\r\n\r\nIt might seem hard, in this enumeration of the many forms in which the\r\napple is made to contribute to the benefit of mankind, not to notice\r\nthat form in which it defies age, I refer to the dried apple. No\r\nfestoons are more comely than were those half-circles that used to\r\ndecorate the rafters of the old-fashioned kitchen. I confess that no\r\ndried fruit is worthy to be called fruit, whether it be huckleberry,\r\nor peach, or pear, or apple. Once dried, these things have lost the\r\nsoul of their flavor; and no coddling, no soaking, no experimenting,\r\nwill ever bring them back to what they were in their original fresh\r\nlife. You cannot give youth to old age in apples any more than among\r\nmen. And yet, as a _souvenir_, as a sad remembrances of days gone by,\r\ndried apples are very good.\r\n\r\nNext, we naturally consider the use of apples as food for stock,—for\r\nswine, for horses, and for cattle. This use of them is known; but it\r\nseems to me that they are not thus employed near so much as their\r\nbenefits would justify.\r\n\r\nLast of all, let me speak of cider; for, although the days of\r\ntemperance have banished cider from its former and almost universal\r\nposition upon the farmer’s table, it is creeping back again. Not\r\ndaring to come in its own name, it comes in the name of a neighbor,\r\nand is called _champagne_. But whether it comes in one form or\r\nanother, it still is savory of the orchard; still it brings warmth to\r\nchilly veins; still it is a contribution to many a homely domestic\r\nfestival. And though I cannot, as a temperance man, exhort you to make\r\nit, I must say, that if you _will_ make it, you had better make it\r\ngood!\r\n\r\nBut woe to him who takes another step in that direction! Cider-brandy\r\nis a national disgrace. How great is the calamity that impends over a\r\ncommunity that makes cider-brandy may be known by the recent history\r\nof the Shenandoah valley; it being declared by several of the Richmond\r\npapers that the defeat of Early was owing to the abundance of\r\napple-jack there.\r\n\r\nIt only remains that I should say a single word on the subject of the\r\napple as an article of commerce. Whether fresh or dried, it is still,\r\nin that relation, a matter of no small importance. The home market is\r\nenlarging every year; and as soon as the apple shall become so cheap\r\nthat all men may have it no matter how poor they may be, the market\r\nmust of necessity have become very much augmented. Many men suppose\r\nthat as orchards increase and fruit multiplies the profits diminish.\r\nSuch is not the fact. As the commoner kinds multiply, and the common\r\npeople learn to use them as daily food, the finer kinds will bear\r\nproportionally higher prices; and cheapness is one of the steps to\r\nprofit in all things that are consumed in the community. And I should\r\nbe glad to see the day when, for a few pence, every drayman, every\r\ncommon laborer in every city, should be able to bring as much fruit to\r\nhis house every day as his family could consume in that day. I should\r\nbe glad to see in our cities, what is to be seen to some extent in the\r\ncities of Europe, the time when a penny or two will enable a man to\r\nbring home enough flowers to decorate his table of food twice a day.\r\n\r\nWe have not merely in view the profits of raising fruit when we exhort\r\nyou to bestow your attention on the apple more and more as an article\r\nof commerce; we have also in view the social influence which it may be\r\nmade to exert. I hold that when in any respect you lift the common\r\npeople up, whether by giving them a better dwelling, by placing within\r\ntheir reach better furniture, or by enabling them to furnish their\r\ntable better, you are raising them toward self-respect; you are\r\nraising them toward the higher positions in society. For, although all\r\nmen should start with the democracy, all men have a right to stop with\r\nthe aristocracy. Let all put their feet on the same level; and then\r\nlet them shoot as high as they please. Blessed is the man that knows\r\nhow to overtop his neighbors by a fair development of skill and\r\nstrength. And every single step of advance in general cultivation,\r\neven though it is brought about by so humble an instrumentality as the\r\nmultiplication of fruit, or anything else that augments the range of\r\nhealthful enjoyment among the common people, not only stimulates their\r\nmoral growth, but, through that growth, gives the classes above them a\r\nbetter chance to grow. One of the most efficient ways of elevating the\r\nwhole community is to multiply the means of livelihood among the\r\npoorest and commonest.\r\n\r\nI will not finish my remarks with those elaborate statistics or with\r\nthose admirable and eloquent periods with which I should be pleased to\r\nentertain you, for two reasons: first, because I would not consume\r\nyour time at so late an hour; and, secondly, because I have none of\r\nthese things at hand!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA FEW FLOWERS EASILY RAISED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 22d, 1868._\r\n\r\nThe love of flowers is steadily increasing among the common people of\r\nAmerica, and anything which shall increase the knowledge and skill of\r\nthe _plain people_ in the management of flowers will be a contribution\r\nto the public welfare.\r\n\r\nThose that are rich can command the services of expert gardeners, and\r\nneed no advice from me. But there are thousands who have ground enough\r\naround their dwellings, and yet have little knowledge in the selection\r\nof plants and flowers, and little skill in the cultivation of them, to\r\nwhom I may be of some service if I give such hints as have been\r\nderived chiefly from my own experience.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that my reader has given but little attention to the\r\ncultivation of flowers, and that he needs to be told the simplest\r\nthings, I would begin by recommending him to send for a _catalogue_ of\r\nflowers to Mr. Vick, Rochester, N. Y., or to Mr. B. K. Bliss, of Park\r\nPlace, New York, or Mr. Thorburn, John Street, also New York; not, as\r\nmight at first be supposed, for the sake of the list of seeds, but\r\nbecause each catalogue contains brief directions how to prepare the\r\nground, how to sow various kinds of seeds, etc., etc. With such hints\r\nas these catalogues afford, one can begin. The very first step is to\r\n_succeed the first year in admirably raising one or two things_. If\r\none undertakes too much before having practical experience he will\r\nfail, become disgusted, and give up the whole effort at flowers in\r\ndiscouragement. But the exquisite delight of seeing a bed of flowers,\r\nof your own raising, and thoroughly good, will be apt to inspire a\r\nreal ambition, and lay the foundation for future success with more\r\ndifficult flowers.\r\n\r\nI will suppose a young lady, who never has cultivated flowers, but who\r\ncan afford to hire a man’s services for one or two days in the spring.\r\nShe is to perform all the rest of the work herself. What shall she\r\nplant?\r\n\r\n_Morning-glories._ If possible, select a place which the morning sun\r\nwill not reach before nine or ten o’clock in the forenoon, in order to\r\nsave the daily bloom from withering before you have had half enough\r\nenjoyment. Let the ground be made mellow, and enriched with black dirt\r\nfrom the woods, or with old and well-decayed barn-yard manure, or, if\r\nneither are convenient, with a pint of _superphosphate of lime_ to\r\neach square yard of ground, well mixed into the soil. This can now be\r\nbought in almost every large town, or the merchant who sells seeds\r\nwill procure it for you.\r\n\r\nThe common sorts of morning-glories, if combined, will answer well.\r\nBut one who would do the best should have two beds, one of the\r\n_Convolvulus_ and the other of _Ipomea_. The difference is of\r\nimportance only to a botanist. To the common eye the flowers are the\r\nsame. Of _Ipomeas_ there is a _puce_-colored one, which blossoms late\r\nin the afternoon, named _Buona Nox_; a _mazarine-blue_, shading to red\r\n(_Learii_); a _sky-blue with white edge,_ called in the\r\ncatalogue—don’t be afraid!—_Ipomea hederacea superba grandiflora_, i.\r\ne. the superb great-flowering ivy-leaved _Ipomea_. And then there is a\r\nvery fine variety of this same one, whose Latin name you will get by\r\nadding to the above the compound word _Atro-violacea_. One more name,\r\nviz. _Ipomea limbata elegantissima_.\r\n\r\nPlant the seeds as soon as the frost is finally out of the ground. Let\r\nthere be pales, or strings, or trellis, arranged for them to climb\r\nupon, and you will have all summer long, and till the frost kills\r\nthem, a magnificent show of exquisite blossoms every morning; Sundays\r\nas well as week-days, for flowers wear their Sunday clothes all\r\nthrough the week. We have derived as much pleasure from these\r\nmorning-glories as from any one thing in our garden. They are healthy\r\nand hearty growers, not infested with insects, profuse in bloom,\r\nsurpassing all blossoms in exquisite form and delicacy, and, what is\r\nof prime importance, holding forth through the whole summer, whether\r\nhot or cold, wet or dry.\r\n\r\nThe common morning-glory will sow itself, and come up every year in\r\nthe same place; but the seed of the _Ipomea_ must be saved and planted\r\nevery spring anew. Now, let some sweet girl begin her flower-life with\r\nmorning-glories—nothing else—the first year, and see if she will ever\r\nlet a summer go by afterward without flowers!\r\n\r\nA bed of _China Aster_, although blossoming for only a few weeks, may\r\nbe had with so little trouble that one may well undertake it. Send for\r\nthe best kind, say _Truffant’s Giant Emperor_, or his new\r\n_Peony-flowered_. Plant them in rows six inches apart, in a seed-bed.\r\nKeep them clean from all weeds. When grown from an inch to two inches\r\nhigh, transplant them to a prepared bed, placing them about fifteen\r\ninches apart each way. The ground should be rich, light, and gently\r\nhoed, at least once a week, to keep the surface open. If _very_ large\r\nflowers are wanted, not more than three blooms should be allowed to\r\none root. We prefer, however, to give the plant a rich soil and let it\r\nyield its flowers, large and small, to suit itself. The seed should be\r\nsaved from the largest blossoms only.\r\n\r\nA particular favorite with us is the _Petunia_. If fine seed is\r\nsecured, a bed of seedlings may be easily grown which will be splendid\r\nthe whole summer long. The directions for the aster may be followed\r\nfor _Petunias_, except that the plants should stand _two feet_ apart.\r\nSelect a place where they will have air and sun all day. They are\r\ngenerous, and will roll out billows of color through the whole summer,\r\nand even after the light early frosts have cut down many other things.\r\n\r\nThere are two other beds on which we depend for color every summer,\r\nand could no more afford to miss than we could the sunsets, viz.\r\n_Dwarf Convolvulus_ and _Eschscholtzia_. A bed of _Dwarf_ or\r\n_Convolvulus Minor_, say six by twelve feet, will be an object of\r\npleasure all summer long. They are to be planted where they are to\r\nstand, as they will not bear transplanting good-naturedly. Sow in rows\r\neight inches apart, and when well up thin out, leaving the plants a\r\nfoot apart. There are five or six varieties, and the mixed seed, from\r\na reputable seedsman, should contain them all. No one will be willing\r\nto go without a bed of Dwarf Convolvulus who has once seen how easily\r\nthey are raised, and how splendid and long-continued is their\r\nblossoming.\r\n\r\nManage the _Eschscholtzia_ in almost exactly the same way. There are\r\nthree shades of color,—pale yellow, bright yellow, and orange. The\r\nfoliage is extremely delicate. The buds are very shapely, and the full\r\nbloom gives brilliancy to the whole region where the bed is planted.\r\nNo one knows this flower who has not seen its effect in beds, or on\r\nlong borders. In a similar way the _Poppy_ should be raised. Get seed\r\nof the _Carnation_ Poppy and the _Peony-flowered_ Poppy. It will not\r\nbear transplanting well.\r\n\r\nA bed of _Portulacca_ will be so brilliant that it will almost put\r\nyour eyes out when the sun shines; and it is so easy to raise, that\r\nsuccess is no credit. Prepare a bed, say four by six feet, or larger\r\nif you choose, and rake it off smoothly. The seeds are extremely\r\nminute. Take a pinch of them as if they were snuff, and then do by\r\nthem what everybody ought to do by snuff,—sift them evenly all over\r\nthe ground. Then just touch the ground with the tips of the\r\nrake-teeth, stirring it very lightly. Take a spade and _spat_ the\r\nsurface gently, so as to bring the soil home to the seed. Keep weeds\r\naway, and for the rest do nothing but enjoy the labor of your hands.\r\nIt will come up of itself every year, and become a weed if you wish it\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThere, we have mentioned enough flowers for a beginning. They are all\r\nhardy, profuse bloomers, and, with the exception of the aster, last\r\nall summer, and form masses of color which will charm the eye every\r\ntime you look out of your window. A girl can do all that is to be\r\ndone, except working the ground, and even that ought not to be so hard\r\nas it would be to go without flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFLOWER-FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _February 29th, 1868._\r\n\r\nI acknowledge the merits of flower-_gardening_, but a kind of\r\nnecessity has compelled me to practice flower-_farming_. I do not live\r\nupon my little farm, on the Hudson, except for a few months in\r\nmidsummer. To keep a professional gardener befits more ample means\r\nthan mine. Yet I must have flowers; I am as set and determined to have\r\nflowers as my farmer, Mr. Turner, is to have vegetables; and there is\r\na friendly quarrel on hand all the season, a kind of border warfare,\r\nbetween flowers and vegetables, which shall have this spot, and which\r\nshall secure that nook; whether in this southern slope it shall be\r\nonions or gladioluses; whether a row of lettuce shall edge that patch,\r\nor of asters. I think, on a calm review, that I have rather gained on\r\nMr. Turner. The fact is, I found that he had me at advantage, being\r\nalways on the place, and having the whole spring to himself. So I\r\nshrewdly tampered with the man himself, and before he knew what he was\r\nabout, I had infected him with the flower mania (and this is a\r\ndisorder which I have never known cured); so that I had an ally in the\r\nvery enemy’s camp. Indeed, I begin to fear that my manager will get\r\nahead of me yet in skill and love of flowers!\r\n\r\nI can see many and sufficient reasons for parterres of flowers, for\r\nborders of mixed plants, for clumps and ribbons; but I can see no\r\nreason for supposing that flowers grow to advantage _only_ in these\r\nformal methods.\r\n\r\nIn a plantation of _tomatoes_, if every alternate plant in the outer\r\nrow is a _petunia_ you will find a charming effect in the red fruit of\r\nthe one and the profuse blossoming of the other; and on these outer\r\nrows the tomatoes may be left to ripen for seed, as being more exposed\r\nto the sun, thus adding the beauty of their rich color.\r\n\r\nI do not know why a square plat of beets or onions may not be edged\r\nwith asters, or with balsams. Sometimes I plant a few alternate rows\r\nof flowers with my root crops, and find that carrots and stocks,\r\nalternated, are admirable friends. When the main crops are in, there\r\nare always some outlying edges, some places about the walls, which\r\nwould be surely filled in with cabbages, if I did not jump at the\r\nchance. I have great luck with tropealums, nasturtiums, and\r\nparticularly with labias, which are as easy of culture, on a farm, as\r\na bean. And I have a fancy that when one comes upon a heap of stones\r\nin a corner, covered over with all varieties of tropealum, he takes\r\nmore pleasure in them than if found just where one would look for\r\nthem, in a flower-bed.\r\n\r\nIf I should lay down a rule, it would be that, in arable land, or in\r\nshrubbery and forest, no man should have to walk more than twenty\r\npaces to find a flower. If a lady should meet you on any acre on your\r\nfarm, you ought to be able then and there to make up for her an\r\nacceptable bouquet.\r\n\r\nIn an unexpected way, I am like to have my rule kept for me. For, in\r\nautumn, the stems and haulms of flowers go to the barn-yard and join\r\nall other stuff fit for compost; and when, in the spring, it is hauled\r\nout, I find, on every part of the farm, that stray seeds have shaken\r\nout, and sown themselves, and produced volunteer flowers. Indeed, the\r\nprimrose family are getting too familiar; larkspurs are everywhere;\r\ncoreopsis glitters all over the fields; poppies have turned vagrants;\r\nand the portulacca has fairly become a weed. Farms should be carried\r\non for profit and pleasure; and, as I fail in the former, I am\r\ndetermined to make up in the latter element.\r\n\r\nNow and then, on the outer row of Indian corn, a _convolvulus_,\r\nclimbing to the very top and full of blossoms, will cheat nothing and\r\nenrich the eye a great deal. There is always a spot or two, amidst\r\nfield crops, where a _Ricinus sanguineus_ (castor bean) will do\r\nbravely; and I will affirm that no fancier will be able to get past it\r\nwithout stopping to look at its generous palms.\r\n\r\nWhere stone-walls prevail, what can be less expensive and what more\r\nbeautiful than to cover them with the Chinese honeysuckles, with, now\r\nand then, the new and hardy golden-veined honeysuckle, with other\r\nhardy sorts, easily propagated? There is also our own wild clematis,\r\nand to this may be joined, at little expense, several of the new\r\nvarieties in this charming family, which may be obtained of\r\nnurserymen.\r\n\r\nIf one has young evergreen trees,—say the Norway spruce,—a few of the\r\nfiner kinds of morning-glory (_Ipomeas_), planted near and suffered to\r\nrun up among the branches and peep out of the green openings, will\r\nhave a beautiful effect all summer long, and the tree will suffer no\r\nharm, as it sometimes does when the bitter-sweet, the ampelopsis, and\r\nother woody vines, take possession of them.\r\n\r\n_Stumps_ are not deemed ornamental, and yet I have seen them turned to\r\nan admirable account. If still standing on their own roots, but\r\ndecayed at the core, let them be hollowed out, deeply as may be,\r\nfilled with good soil, and flowers planted in them, nasturtiums or\r\npetunias or the _linums_ or dwarf morning-glories. Stumps that have\r\nbeen pulled up by the roots, and rolled into a corner, may be dressed\r\nout with ferns, vines, and mosses, and a tasteful hand will array them\r\nin such beauty that the farmer will be reluctant another season to\r\ngive them up to the axe and the stove.\r\n\r\nFlowers peeping out of unlikely spots give a surprise of pleasure.\r\nTherefore stick in a flower just where it would not be expected. No\r\nmatter if it “was never done before,” or if “farmers don’t do so in\r\nthese parts,” or if “flowers are a trouble, and don’t bring any\r\nmoney.” They bring what money often fails to bring,—refinement and\r\npleasure. There is no use, my old friend under a rough coat, in making\r\nbelieve that you don’t like flowers. I know that you do. Somewhere in\r\nyou is a spot, if the rubbish can be cleared away, which a flower\r\nalways touches. There is no reason why rich gentlemen should own all\r\nthe flowers. Hard-working farmers and mechanics have as much right to\r\nthem as if they lived without working.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I say of the gladiolus? It is the flower for the million!\r\nIt is as easy to manage as a potato. It blossoms long, and better if\r\ncut and carried into the house than if left out doors. Its varieties\r\nof color are endless. It is healthy; multiplies its _corms_ rapidly,\r\ncan be kept in winter in a common cellar, if dried of a little first;\r\nand is calculated to return as much pleasure for a small outlay as any\r\nflower in vogue. A few dozen to start with will convince any man of\r\nthe truth of my words.\r\n\r\nLet me dissuade you, my dear readers, from too great an addiction to\r\nmere profit. Don’t wait for a regular garden of flowers, but stick\r\nthem in, in nooks and corners, all about the homestead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nA LETTER FROM THE FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         PEEKSKILL, _May 28th, 1868_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. BONNER: You must expect no article from me this week. I am\r\nengaged. I was never more busy in my life. Let me relate my\r\noccupations. At about half past three in the morning, I wake. The\r\nlight is just coming. I do not care for that, as I do not propose to\r\nget up at such an hour. But the birds _do_ care. They evidently wind\r\nup their singing apparatus over night. For, when the first bird breaks\r\nthe silence, in an instant the rest go off, as if a spring had been\r\ntouched which moved them all. Was ever such noise! There are robins\r\nwithout count, wood-thrushes, orioles, sparrows, bobolinks,\r\nmeadow-larks, bluebirds, yellow-birds, wrens, warblers, catbirds (as\r\nthe Northern mocking-bird is called), martins, twittering swallows.\r\nThink of the noise made by mixing all these bird-notes together! Add a\r\nrooster, and a solemn old crow to carry the bass. Then consider that\r\nof each kind there are scores, and of some kinds hundreds, within ear\r\nreach, and you will have some faint conception of the opening chant of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nYou may not believe that I wake so early. But I do. You may be still\r\nless inclined to believe that, after listening for ten minutes to this\r\nmixture, I again go to sleep. But I solemnly do. Nor do I think of\r\ngetting up before six o’clock. Whether I should emerge even then, if\r\nit were not for the savory odor that begins to steal through my\r\ncottage, I cannot tell. After breakfast, there are so many things to\r\nbe done first that I neglect them all. The morning is so fine, the\r\nyoung leaves are so beautiful, the bloom on the orchards is so\r\ngorgeous, the sounds and sights are so many and so winning, that I am\r\napt to sit down on the veranda, for just a moment, and for just\r\nanother, and for a series of them, until an hour goes by. Do not blame\r\nme! Do not laugh at such farming and such a farmer. The soil overhead\r\nbears larger and better crops, for a sensible man, than does the soil\r\nunder feet. There are blossoms in the clouds. There is fruit upon\r\ninvisible trees, to those who know how to pluck it.\r\n\r\nBut then sky-gazing and this dallying with the landscape will not do.\r\nWhat crowds of things require the eye and hand! Flowers must be\r\ntransplanted. Flower-seeds must be sown; shrubs and trees pruned;\r\nvines looked after; a walk taken over the hill to see after some\r\nevergreens, with many pauses to gaze upon the landscape, and many\r\nbirds watched as they are confidentially exhibiting their domestic\r\ntraits before you. The kittens, too, at the barn, must be visited, the\r\ncalf, the new cow. Then every gardener knows how much time is consumed\r\nin noticing the new plants; for instance, I have some eight new\r\nstrawberries that need watching, each one purporting to be a world’s\r\nwonder. I am quite anxious about eight or ten new kinds of clematis;\r\ntwo new species of honeysuckle; eight or ten new and rare evergreens;\r\nand ever so many other things,—shrubs and flowers. What shall I say of\r\nthe new peas, new beans, rare cucumbers, early melons, extraordinary\r\npotatoes?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of potatoes, do you know anything of the _Early Rose_? Let me\r\ntell you. One hundred bushels were sold this spring, to one man, for\r\n_eighty dollars_ a bushel! Since then, they have been selling by the\r\n_pound_, at the increasing prices of one, two, and three dollars a\r\npound. It takes about three potatoes to make a pound.\r\n\r\nNow for a story—true, for I had it from Timothy Titcomb’s lips. A\r\nfriend sent him this potato, with injunctions to give it the utmost\r\ncare. He planted it in his garden, and when it ripened, last summer,\r\nnot informed of its exceeding preciousness, he proceeded to eat. In a\r\nreasonable time he consumed three barrels, which at the lowest price\r\nwere worth about seven hundred dollars!\r\n\r\nI have a very nice plat of these potatoes, and should like to sell\r\nthem to you in advance. As an inducement, I offer mine at _fifty_\r\ndollars a bushel! But this is confidential. I do not wish to be\r\noverrun with purchasers, scrambling for a chance!\r\n\r\nDo you not see that it is impossible for me, amid such incessant and\r\nweighty cares, to compose an article? The air is white with\r\napple-blossoms; the trees are all singing; the steaming ground\r\nbeseeches me to grant it a portion of flower-seeds; by night the\r\nwhippoorwills, and by day the wood-thrush and mocking-bird, fill my\r\nimagination with all sorts of fancies, and how can I write?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _June 18th, 1868._\r\n\r\nThe charms of flowers have been sung ever since letters have existed.\r\nBut in our day the passion for flowers has wonderfully increased, and\r\nthe cultivation of them, which is a thing very different from the\r\nsentiment of admiration, has become so common that it is considered as\r\nan evidence of bad taste for one having any ground _not_ to have\r\nflowers about the dwelling-house.\r\n\r\nBut how few who only receive flowers as gifts, or purchase them, know\r\nthe pains and penalties of flower-raising! It may be imagined that one\r\nhas only to scratch open the ground, bury the seed, and then patiently\r\nwait for nature to do the rest. Listen! First comes the seed-buying.\r\nWe do not think seedsmen any less honest than other men. Indeed, the\r\nconduct of those with whom we have dealt for ten years past leads us\r\nto think that they are honorable and honest in intent. But that does\r\nnot insure good _seeds_.\r\n\r\nThey buy of other seedsmen, in foreign lands, who may not be honest,\r\nor are obliged to trust seed-raisers. And so it comes to pass that\r\nseeds, like thousands of other articles in this wicked and adulterous\r\ngeneration, are adulterated. Italian carnation seed come up miserable\r\nsingle pinks, of very poor colors; balsams are not half so choice as\r\nis the _price_ at which the seed is sold; not one in ten of this\r\nyear’s _ipomea seed_ (convolvulus) will stir out of the ground,—and so\r\nof stock, sweet-william, etc.\r\n\r\nBut, that past, and our seed well planted, there often comes a deluge,\r\nand washes the seed-beds to pieces, or a long wet spell rots the seed\r\nin the ground.\r\n\r\nAt length we gather up what we can, and transplant the remnant, and\r\npatiently wait for the flowers. But we are not the only ones waiting\r\nfor them. A legion of various insects seem to think that all our\r\nflowers were planted for _them_. We have been often asked why were\r\ninsects created? If it is fair to say that the cause of their\r\nexistence may be learned from the effects which they produce, we\r\nboldly aver that they were made to humble man’s arrogance, and to\r\nteach him how much mightier is insect weakness than human power. A\r\ngrasshopper is contemptible. The farmer can crush him at a step. But\r\nlet the plague of grasshoppers be let loose, and all his fields be\r\ndeluged with them; and how easily do myriads of creatures that are\r\nindividually weak overwhelm him and destroy all his labor!\r\n\r\nWe have a realizing sense of the unequal war which is waged between\r\nman and insects. It seems in late years as if horticulture might as\r\nwell be abandoned. Cherries and plums go down before the curculio;\r\napples before the canker-worm, the tent-worm, and the apple-worm;\r\ncurrants before a worm peculiar to itself; melons before half a dozen\r\nkinds of enemies (not including roguish boys).\r\n\r\nAmong flowers the destruction is equally great. As soon as the rose\r\nfairly shakes out its leaves it is attacked: one bug cuts circles out\r\nof the leaves, as if busy with a pair of scissors making diagrams;\r\nthen comes the _thrip_, that can neither be caught, nor wet with\r\nsoapsuds, nor dusted with lime, nor pinched with the fingers,—a nimble\r\nfellow, minute as a speck of flour, but numerous as dust. Close upon\r\nits heels comes the _slug_, whose remorseless appetite leaves nothing\r\nbehind it but the ribs and frame of the leaf. Next come the rose-bugs\r\nproper, of a finer appetite, disdaining anything less delicate than\r\nrose-petals. Of these the number is surpassing; their devastation\r\npitiable. There stand my bushes stripped of leaves and blighted in\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nOf course there are remedies enough. One rose-bush may be treated with\r\nhand-picking, or pinching, or washes, but one or two hundred\r\nrose-bushes would require formidable engineering.\r\n\r\nYear by year the number of insects increases. New flowers come into\r\nthe blighted circle. Aphides, grubs, worms, moles, flies—at the root,\r\nor on the top—resist your labor at every step. They never tire. They\r\nseem never to be full. They get up before you do, and eat on all\r\nnight, after you are asleep.\r\n\r\nWell, we are born into a world which pays few premiums to lazy men.\r\nWhatever is worth having is worth working for. At any rate, Providence\r\nseems to design that no man shall gather who does not sow and tend. Of\r\nevery lazy man it may well be said, What does he in this world? This\r\nis a place for workers. “He that will not work shall not eat,” is an\r\ninspired command. It is as true of the garden as of the field, of\r\nflowers as of fruit and grain. God sends millions of insects over all\r\nour gardens and flower-beds, saying, “We are sent to make you work.”\r\nEvery insect is some malignant enchanter, and every fair-faced flower,\r\nlike a maiden lost in the wilderness, beseeches us to deliver it from\r\nits enemies!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nHAYING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _July 2d, 1868._\r\n\r\nAlas for the poetry of farming! All the songs of milkmaids must be now\r\nlistened for in the old English poets. The whetting of the mower’s\r\nscythe is almost over—quite over on my farm! Instead of that, one\r\nhears the sharp rattle of the mower, and sees the driving-man quite at\r\nhis ease riding round and round the meadow, for all the world as if he\r\nwere out airing. Whereas, heretofore, two acres would be counted a\r\nlarge day’s work, ten and twelve are easily accomplished now!\r\n\r\nNor is the contrast less remarkable in all the after-work. When I was\r\na boy, I was placed in line with all the men that could be mustered,\r\nto shake out the hay with forks; and after a few hours, all hands were\r\ncalled to go over the ground and turn it. To do this rapidly, and yet\r\nso that the bottom side should really come to the top, was no small\r\nknack. Now, a _tedder_, with one man riding, will literally do the\r\nwork of ten men, and do it far better than the most expert can. Have\r\nyou ever seen a tedder? I have a perfect one. The grass rolls up\r\nbehind it and foams, I was going to say, like water behind the wheels\r\nof a steamer. The grass leaps up and whirls as if it were amazingly\r\ntickled with such dealings. The result is, that unless the grass is\r\nvery heavy, and the weather very bad, you may cut your hay in the\r\nmorning and get it into your barn before night, in far better\r\ncondition than it used to be when it required never less than two, and\r\ngenerally a part of three days to cure it.\r\n\r\nBut I have forgotten the _horse-rake_. Instead of the old-fashioned,\r\nlong-handled rake, and the five or six men pulling and hauling to get\r\nthe grass into windrows, that same fellow, with that same horse, rides\r\nhis luxurious rake, and in a fifth part of the time formerly required\r\nputs it into equally good shape. Indeed, haying, if it has lost its\r\npoetry, has also lost its drudgery. A man can now manage a hundred\r\nacres of grass easier than he formerly could twenty.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that remains to be made easy is pitching on and off the\r\nload. It is true that horse-forks have been invented, but I have never\r\nseen any that did their work well; and in my barn, at any rate, the\r\nold work of pitching and mowing remains; and if you wish to know what\r\nfun is, get on to the mow, under the slate roof of my barn, on a hot\r\nday, and let Tim pitch off hay as he will if I give him the wink. You\r\nwill have to step lively, and even then you will often be seen\r\nemerging from heaps of hay thrown over you, like a rat from a bunch of\r\noakum. And then it is so pleasant, when a man is all a-sweat, to have\r\nhis shirt filled with hay-seed, each particular particle of which\r\nmakes believe that it is a flea, and wiggles and tickles upon every\r\nsquare inch of his skin, until he is half desperate.\r\n\r\nIt is the 2d of July, and my grass is all cut, and the last load is\r\nrolling into the barn while I write. How sweet it smells! How jolly\r\nthe children are that have been mounted on the top of the load! And\r\ntheir little scarlet jackets peep out from their nest while Tim stands\r\nguard and nurse. A child that has not ridden up from the meadow to the\r\nbarn on a load of hay has yet to learn one of the luxuries of exultant\r\nchildhood. What care they for jolts, when the whole load is a vast and\r\nmultiplex spring? The more the wagon jounces the better they like it!\r\nThen come the bars, leading into the lane with maple-trees on each\r\nside. The limbs reach down, and the green leaves kiss the children\r\nover and over again. So would I, if I were a green leaf, and not\r\nconsider myself so green after all! And so the load slowly rolls up\r\nthe bill. There is no such thing as momentum in an ox. He is always at\r\na dead pull and at the very hardest. But the children like it. The\r\nslower they move the longer is the ride! Let them take all the comfort\r\nthey can. By and by they will be grown, and own fine carriages, and\r\nroll in style through the streets. But there is many a fair face that\r\nrides in a silk-lined coach, with a sad heart, and would go back if\r\nshe could, O, how gladly, to her joyous ride on a load of hay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF ROBINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      _October 10th._\r\n\r\nThe game-law has relaxed its authority. The gun is set free. I hear it\r\nin the woods, in the fields, on the hills, Sundays and week-days,\r\nbang! bang! bang! as if it could not express its joy, and even\r\ncelebrating its own emancipation.\r\n\r\nWell, let them fire, only so they keep off my hill. It is true that\r\nthe birds have finished their service, and are now of little use,\r\neither as songsters or as worm-exterminators—more’s the pity! But are\r\ntheir past services to be forgotten?\r\n\r\nLet me speak of the robin.\r\n\r\nHe is an immense feeder, and omnivorous. Nothing seems to come\r\namiss—fruit, worm, or seed. Glutton he is not, for he does not eat\r\nmore than he really needs; but he needs more than most birds of his\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nIt is a disputed question, among farmers, whether the robin is a\r\nprofitable bird. Whether he does not damage the fruit crop out of all\r\nproportion to his services in the crusade against insects, I grieve to\r\nsay, that my own household is divided, and that I am the only one that\r\nis openly and wholly a friend to the robin. He is an early riser, and\r\nno sooner has he sung his morning hymn than he begins breakfast. Now,\r\nin the month of June cherries ripen. I have a cherry orchard. When\r\nfully grown, there will be enough for robins and men. But at present\r\nmy trees are like precocious children; they blossom enormously, but\r\nset little fruit. The question now is, Whose is that fruit? The people\r\nin the house declare that it belongs to us. The robins out of doors\r\nsay little about it, but actions speak louder than words. Rising\r\nearlier than we do, they get their breakfast before the smoke rises\r\nfrom my chimneys. I will not permit them to be driven away, and still\r\nless to be shot. I plead their services. I recount their deeds of\r\nvalor against insects; their service of song. But it is all in vain. I\r\nam voted down. All manner of threats are thrown out by the boys, “if I\r\nwould only let them.” But I won’t let them!\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct grounds on which these birds are to be\r\npreserved and encouraged. The first ground is the refining pleasure\r\nwhich they give to every person of true susceptibility. Thousands\r\nthere are who live in the country who will regard this as sheer\r\nsentimentality. They are robust people, who drive around all day with\r\nvigorous industry, and have always done so, until at length their very\r\nstandard of manhood is made up of some kind of physical force. He is a\r\nman that can lift the largest weight, run the longest and fastest, cut\r\nthe most grain, climb most lithely, wrestle the most dextrously. And\r\nif he can make a shrewd bargain, has an eye for the points in an ox or\r\nhorse, has the knack of making money, and a good-natured way of\r\npushing about among men, he is considered, and considers himself, to\r\nbe a real up-and-down man!\r\n\r\nBut where are the finer traits? God made blossom bulbs in every\r\nnature, and if men do not blossom they are deficient in the higher\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nTo disregard qualities of beauty, in form, color, motion, and song, is\r\nso far to indicate a deformity of one’s own nature. We never think one\r\nto be more manly who cares nothing for the unmarketable graces of the\r\nnatural world, than he who makes them a part of his daily enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe argument is conclusive to a fine nature, when one says, “Birds are\r\ntoo beautiful to be killed.” It may be replied that noxious insects\r\nand animals are beautiful, too, and yet are destroyed by the humane\r\nand refined, because they are mischievous. We admit the statement, and\r\nare willing to apply it to birds. When they are really destructive to\r\ncrops, or when they are, at proper seasons, needful for food, it is no\r\ninhumanity to take their lives. They must take their part and lot with\r\nthe whole creation, which everywhere eats and is eaten.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our robin. There is no season of the year when the\r\nrobin does not prevent more mischief than he accomplishes. He is an\r\nenormous eater, and, for the most part, he prefers a meat diet. No one\r\nwho has not taken pains to observe and estimate can form any\r\nconception of the insects and worms devoured by the robin between\r\nMarch and August—that is, during the whole nesting period. One robin\r\neats, in a single season, what, if built into a solid form, would be\r\nmore than a whole ox. Fruit is but a small part of his diet; cherries,\r\nstrawberries, and grapes, for a while, suffer from his depredations.\r\nYet, if there were no birds these very things would suffer far more.\r\nInsects are more to be dreaded than birds. They elude our vigilance,\r\nthey work secretly, they swarm in such numbers as to defy man’s power.\r\nBut birds keep them down. They destroy myriads of eggs, of grubs, of\r\ntender worms, and of fruit-loving insects. To destroy birds for the\r\nsake of saving fruit is like throwing down the fence about one’s\r\ngarden to keep the pigs out! Even admit, as some do and we do not,\r\nthat blackbirds and crows deserve to be shot for destroying the\r\nplanter’s seed. We claim that the robin does not belong to their\r\ncompany. He preserves a hundred-fold more than he destroys.\r\n\r\nOn every ground, then, of humanity, of good taste, and of thrift,\r\nrobins should be spared. They are our best friends. They are, beyond\r\nall question, the finest song-bird of the temperate zone. They are a\r\nwatch and guard against insect depredations in orchard and garden,\r\nand, with other birds, they make possible the raising of fruit, which,\r\nwithout them, it is no exaggeration to say, would be utterly\r\nimpossible. They are, next to the wren and sparrows, the most\r\ncompanionable of birds, hovering about the dwellings of man, and\r\nfollowing him, step by step, as he subdues the wilderness, and singing\r\nthe song of triumph for the axe and the plow.\r\n\r\nOne word as to the robin’s song. Whoever has read Audubon’s\r\ndescription of the wood-thrush’s song, and the still more glowing\r\naccount by a writer in the _Atlantic Monthly_ of two or three years\r\nago, will surely be disappointed on first hearing it. In any proper\r\nsense, it has no _song_, but only a few sweet sentences, which it\r\nutters in a sad and almost melancholy way, sitting solitary in some\r\nforest edge, or tree overhanging a brook. The bird is a recluse. So,\r\none imagines a tender-hearted woman, disappointed in love, yet not\r\nembittered, might sing from the casement of a nunnery a hymn of\r\nmingled resignation and regret. But, to compare this monosyllabic song\r\nof the wood-thrush to the robin’s, is like comparing a ballad to an\r\noratorio, or the tinkling of a guitar to the sweet tone of a\r\npiano-forte under the hands of some Perabo.\r\n\r\nThe robin is an out-door bird. He lives in the sunshine. He attracts\r\nno sympathy by delicate ways. He is altogether robust, and full of\r\ndashing life. When twenty or thirty robins between three and four\r\no’clock in a June morning are at full voice, it would be no\r\nexaggeration to compare it to a rain of music. It is no dainty\r\nthrumming,—no parceling out of a sweet note or two, with more rests\r\nthan notes. It is a musical rush, the exultation of a healthy, hearty\r\nbird, that sings by the half-hour, without pause, and is ever ready to\r\nsing again.\r\n\r\nThe evening song of the robin I most love to hear. Heard from the top\r\nof some orchard tree, or of some meadow maple, while his note has the\r\nfire and brilliancy of his morning song, there is in it a slight\r\nundertone of sadness. Indeed, this evening song seems to be a\r\nmate-call. For ten or fifteen minutes the bird will send out its\r\nmellow call over all the region, if peradventure the truant mother may\r\ncome home. A slight impatience mixes with its closing notes. He flies\r\nto a neighboring tree, utters two or three sharp single notes, and\r\nthen, beginning again, swells out his long call louder than before,\r\nwarbling five to ten minutes. He pauses. No bird returns. He sits\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he remembers that there had been a little domestic quarrel\r\nduring the day, and if his mate is dead, he may never be able to say\r\nto her, “I am sorry.” A nest full of little birds needs the mother.\r\nThe twilight is deepening. Once more, its brilliance now toned down by\r\nan unmistakable sadness, he sends out far and near through the\r\ndew-damp air a song which is more a lamentation than a call. If there\r\nbe no response, he flies silently away, and the air rests.\r\n\r\nBut, sometimes, just as his song is ending, it breaks out into a sharp\r\nnote of surprise. A flutter is heard, and two birds fly hastily away.\r\nThe wanderer has come home again!\r\n\r\nCan one, all summer long, follow birds with sympathy, and enter into\r\ntheir gentle life, throwing around it, by the imagination, the charm\r\nof the affections, and then consent to their destruction as if they\r\nhad been mere birds from a coop? Shoot and eat my birds? It is but a\r\nstep this side of cannibalism. The next step beyond, and one would\r\nhanker after Jenny Lind or Miss Kellogg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nSOUNDS OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _July 24th._\r\n\r\nThe sounds and motions of trees constitute subtle but important\r\nelements of pleasure. It is not enough that a tree have a comely form\r\nas a whole; that it cast a dense shade in the sultry days of summer;\r\nthat, perhaps, it yield a nut or fruit; and that, finally, when it\r\ngives up its life to the inevitable ax, its prostrate trunk shall\r\nfurnish good timber. Besides these uses of bodily comfort and of\r\neconomy, a tree, like a rich-hearted person, has a hundred nameless\r\nways which we hardly stop to analyze, but which, were they suddenly\r\ntaken away, we should miss.\r\n\r\nThe murmuring of trees is profoundly affecting to a sensitive spirit.\r\nIn some moods of imagination one cannot help feeling that trees have a\r\nlow song, or a conversation of leaves. They whisper, or speak, or cry\r\nout, and even roar. No one knows this last quality so well as those\r\nwho have been in old oak forests in a storm, with violent wind. A\r\ndense forest opposes such a resistance to the free passage of the air,\r\nthat the sound is much deadened. But in a park or oak-opening, where\r\nspaces are left for the motion of the air, and among open-branched\r\ntrees, a storm moves with such power and majesty, that not even the\r\nbattles of thunder-clouds are more sublime, and, under certain\r\ncircumstances, it becomes terrific. At the beginning of the tempest,\r\nthe trees sway and toss as if seeking to escape; as the violence\r\nincreases, the branches bounce back, the leaves, turning their white\r\nunder sides to the light, fairly scream. The huge boughs creak and\r\nstrain like a ship in a storm. Now and then some branches which have\r\ngrown across each other are drawn back and forth, as if demons were\r\nscraping infernal bass-viols. Occasionally a branch breaks with a wild\r\ncrash, or some infirm tree, caught unawares in a huge puff of the\r\nstorm, goes down with crashing as it falls, and with a thunder-stroke\r\nwhen it reaches the ground. I would go farther to hear a storm-concert\r\nin an old forest, than any music that man ever made. No one who is\r\nfamiliar with forest sounds but is sure, when he hears Beethoven’s\r\nmusic, that much of it was inspired by the sounds of winds among\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThere are milder joys, however, in tree converse. Only this morning I\r\nawakened to hear it rain. That steady splash of drops which a\r\nnortheast wind brings on is not easily mistaken. I flatter myself that\r\nmy ear is too well trained to all the ordinary sounds of nature to be\r\neasily deceived. I rise, and throw back the blinds, when lo! not a\r\ndrop is falling. It is the wind in my maple-trees. I had thought of\r\nthat, and listened with the most discriminating attention, and was\r\nsure that it was rain!\r\n\r\nTwice in our life we lived in houses built on the edge of the original\r\nforests. These had been thinned out, and recesses opened up. It\r\nhappened in both cases that an ash and a hickory had been left, which\r\nshot up, without side branches, to a great height. The trunks were\r\nsupple and tough. Whenever the winds moved gently, these long and\r\nlithe trees moved with singular grace and beauty. As there was no\r\nperceptible wind along the ground, their movements seemed voluntary.\r\nAnd yet there was in it that kind of irresolution which one sees in\r\nsleep-walking. But as soon as the breath became a breeze, the wide\r\ncircles through which these rooted gymnasts moved was wonderful. They\r\nseemed going forth in every direction, and yet surely and quickly\r\nspringing back to position again. And in every motion, such was their\r\nelasticity, they manifested the utmost grace. The sighing of winds in\r\na pine forest has no parallel sound except upon the sea-shore. Of all\r\nsounds of leaves it is the sweetest and saddest, to certain moods of\r\nsummer leisure.\r\n\r\nThe pine sings, like the poet, with no every-day voice, but in a tone\r\napart from all common sounds. It has the power to change the\r\nassociations, and to quicken the poetic sensibility, as no other\r\nsinging tree can do. Every one should have this old harper, like a\r\nseer or a priest among trees, about his dwelling. Under an old pine\r\nwould naturally be found the young maiden, whose new lover was far\r\nacross the seas. In the sounds that would descend she could not fail\r\nto hear the voices of the sea,—the roar of winds, the plash of waves\r\nrunning in upon the shore. A young mother, whose first-born had\r\nreturned to God who gave it, would go at twilight to the pines; for,\r\nto her ear, the whole air must needs seem full of spirit voices. They\r\nwould sing to her thoughts in just such sad strains as soothe sorrow.\r\nNor would it be strange if, in the rise and fall of these sylvan\r\nsyllables, she should imagine that she heard her babe again, calling\r\nto her from the air.\r\n\r\nEvery country place should have that very coquette among trees, the\r\naspen. It seems never to sleep. Its twinkling fingers are playing in\r\nthe air at some arch fantasy almost without pause. If you sit at a\r\nwindow with a book, it will wink and blink, and beckon, and coax, till\r\nyou cannot help speaking to it! That must be a still day that does not\r\nsee the aspen quiver! A single leaf sometimes will begin to wag, and\r\nnot another on the whole tree will move. Sometimes a hidden breath\r\nwill catch at a lower branch, then, shifting, will leave that still,\r\nwhile it shakes a topmost twig. Though the air may move so gently that\r\nyour cheek does not feel it, this sensitive tree will seem all a\r\nshiver, and turn its leaves upward with shuddering chill. It is the\r\ndaintiest fairy of all the trees. One should have an aspen on every\r\nside of his house, that no window should be without a chance to look\r\nupon its nods and becks, and to rejoice in its innocent witcheries. I\r\nhave seen such fair sprites, too, in human form. But one does not get\r\noff so easily, if he sports too much with them. The aspen leaf makes\r\nno wounds. Its frolics spin no silken threads which one cannot follow,\r\nand which will not break!\r\n\r\nThe musical qualities of trees have not been considered enough, in\r\nplanting around our dwellings. The great-leaved magnolias have no fine\r\nsound. Willows have but little. Cedars, yew-trees, and Lombardy\r\npoplars are almost silent. It is said that the Lombardy poplar is the\r\nmale tree, the female having never come over. It is very likely. It is\r\nstiff enough to be an old bachelor. It spreads out no side branches.\r\nIts top dies early. It casts a penurious shadow.\r\n\r\nBut my hand is tired. The winds move; all the leaves call me. Let me\r\ngo forth.\r\n\r\nThis ocean above me is sure to cure trouble. The winds sound, the\r\ntrees sing. My soul yearns. Its thoughts and moods below may roll like\r\na disturbed sea; but, drawn up into the heavenly air, like the waters\r\nof the sea, they forget their wrath, and descend again in gentle dews\r\nand nourishing rains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nUNVEILED NONSENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _August 28th._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. BONNER: Are you not a censor of all your contributors? Do\r\nyou not read cautiously all matter sent to the _Ledger_, to prevent\r\nthe entrance thereinto of any injurious sentiments? And yet you have\r\nallowed _blasphemy_ in your columns? You have! Or else the _Christian\r\nIntelligencer_, the Dutch Reformed religious journal of New York, by\r\none of its contributors, is greatly mistaken. An article appears there\r\nsigned “Puritan,” and entitled “Veiled Profanity.” It begins with an\r\nextract from an article of one of your contributors:—\r\n\r\n     “Henry Ward Beecher says, ‘The only way to exterminate the\r\n     Canada thistle is to plant it for a crop, and propose to\r\n     make money out of it. Then worms will gnaw it, bugs will\r\n     bite it, beetles will bore it, aphides will suck it, birds\r\n     will peck it, heat will scorch it, rains will drown it, and\r\n     mildew and blight will cover it.’”\r\n\r\nAnd now guess, if you can, what harm lies couched in these words. Put\r\non your spectacles. Nothing wrong, do you say? O, but there is! _You_,\r\na Scotch-Irish Presbyterian, and can’t see heresy! Fie, for shame, to\r\nbe beaten by a Dutchman! Now, let our _Intelligencer’s_ man express\r\nhimself. The italics are his, not mine:—\r\n\r\n     “These bugs, beetles, aphides, heat, rain, and mildew are\r\n     the messengers of God. If they are sent, they _are on an\r\n     errand for God_! Now, if the above extract has a point, it\r\n     is that when mankind plant a crop of any kind of grain or\r\n     seed, _God_ takes _a malicious pleasure in defeating such\r\n     schemes_.”\r\n\r\nThis is exquisite! If mildew attacks my grape-vines, _it is on an\r\nerrand for God_, and if I sprinkle it with sulphur as a remedy, I put\r\nbrimstone into the very face of God’s messenger! When it _rains_—is\r\nnot rain, too, God’s messenger?—does “Puritan” dare to open a\r\nblasphemous umbrella, and push it up in the very face of this divine\r\nmessenger? When a child is attacked by one of “God’s messengers”—measles,\r\ncanker-rash, dysentery, scarlet-fever—would it be a very great sin to\r\nsend for a doctor on purpose that he might resist these divine\r\nmessengers? There are insects which attack men, against one of which\r\nwe set up combs, and against another sulphur. “Nay,” says Puritan. “If\r\nthey are sent, _they are on an errand for God_.”\r\n\r\n“Puritan” goes on:—\r\n\r\n     “Such a sentiment is far deeper in its tone than a mere\r\n     _murmur_. Especially as Mr. Beecher’s farm at Fishkill is\r\n     well known to be cultivated with reference to making money.”\r\n\r\nYes, we confess it. A “murmur” very imperfectly expresses our feelings\r\nas we dig at a Canada thistle, or squirt whale-oil soapsuds over a\r\nmyriad of “Puritan’s” divine messengers, called aphides. A _grumble_\r\nwould not be too strong a word to use on such occasions. Nay, the\r\nreverend gentleman has been known to say, in a paroxysm of\r\nhorticultural impiety, “I wish every rose-bug on the place was dead!”\r\nwhich must seem to “Puritan” a piece of horrible depravity.\r\n\r\nI did not before know that I had a farm in _Fishkill_. My experience\r\nwith the farm at Peekskill, “which is well known to be cultivated with\r\nreference to making money,” is such, that if it be true that I own\r\nanother farm at Fishkill, I shall consider myself on the straight road\r\nto the poor-house!\r\n\r\nBut there is more coming:—\r\n\r\n     “The charge of the reverend gentleman amounts to this,—that\r\n     whenever he attempts to raise a crop of wheat, corn, flax,\r\n     or grass, God sends beetles, bugs, aphides, heat, rain, and\r\n     mildew, to blast his designs.\r\n\r\n     “This has the _ring_ of Cain when his sacrifice was\r\n     rejected. That primeval sinner vented his anger towards God\r\n     on his holy brother. Mr. H. W. Beecher vents his anger\r\n     towards the real cause of his mildewed crops, by charging\r\n     the innocent instruments in their Maker’s hand. If this is\r\n     not blasphemy in one as well informed as Mr. Beecher is, we\r\n     have read his words amiss.\r\n                                                      “PURITAN.”\r\n\r\nI may have been mistaken, but it has seemed to me that every crop that\r\nI have ever attempted to raise has had swarms of “messengers” sent\r\nupon it. But, until now, I never suspected that God sent them, in any\r\nother sense than that in which he sends diseases, famines, tyrants,\r\nliterary “Puritans,” and all other evils which afflict humanity.\r\n\r\nBut what is to be done about this matter? If it be “blasphemy” to\r\nspeak against bugs, it can be little short of sacrilege to smash them.\r\nHere have I been, in the blindness of unrepented depravity,\r\nslaughtering millions of “the messengers of God” called aphides! I\r\nhave ruthlessly slain those other angelic “messengers” called\r\nmosquitoes, who came singing to me with misplaced confidence. I have\r\neven railed at fleas, and spoken irreverently of gnats. I have gone\r\nfurther: on a sultry summer’s day, after dinner, I have turned out of\r\nmy room every one of those “messengers of God” which wicked boys call\r\nflies—every one but one, I mean; and, just as the sounds grew faint\r\nand sight dim, and I was sinking into that entrancing experience, the\r\nfirst virgin moments of slumber, an affectionate fly settled on my\r\nnose, ran down to kiss my lips, and, like a traveler on a new\r\ncontinent, set about exploring my whole face. Instead of greeting this\r\n“messenger” divine as “Puritan” would, I confess to a lively vexation.\r\nAnd if speaking of flies in a very disrespectful manner is\r\nblasphemous, I must confess to the charge!\r\n\r\nBut soberly, Mr. Bonner, is it not pitiable to have among us men\r\npretending to intelligence, who bring religion into discredit by such\r\nhopeless stupidity?\r\n\r\nIn the velocipede rinks, besides those for speed, premiums are offered\r\nto the men who can ride the _slowest_. “Puritan” should enter himself.\r\nIf anybody can go slower, he must be a marvel of torpidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nNATURAL ORDER OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _May 21st._\r\n\r\nHe must have an artist’s eye for color and form who can arrange a\r\nhundred flowers as tastefully, in any other way, as by strolling\r\nthrough a garden, picking here one and there one, and adding them to\r\nthe bouquet in the accidental order in which they chance to come. Thus\r\nwe see every summer day the fair lady coming in from the breezy\r\nside-hill with gorgeous colors, and most witching effects. If only she\r\ncould be changed to alabaster, was ever a finer show of flowers in so\r\nfine a vase? But instead, allowed to remain as they were gathered, the\r\nflowers are laid upon the table, divided and rearranged on some\r\nprinciple of taste, I know not what, but never regain that charming\r\nnaturalness and grace which they first had.\r\n\r\nAs to the bouquets put up for market, the less said about them the\r\nbetter. They are mere pillories in which, like innocent children put\r\ninto the stocks, flowers are punished! Squeezed, tied on sticks,\r\nformal and pedantic, the flowers lose their rare charms, their\r\ndelicacy, their individuality, their exquisite variety of form, every\r\nelement of floral beauty except color. They are used as mere pigments.\r\nThey are poor studies in color. There are few who really know anything\r\nabout flowers by their finer qualities. The elder Park—who committed\r\nthe capital crime of leaving Brooklyn and going back to Scotland to\r\nlive—loved flowers after the true sort. We remember one day going to\r\nhis green-house in Amity Street, and after a world of talk about all\r\nsorts of things, and looking over all his azaleas, camellias,\r\nlaurustinus, and what not, he drew us bashfully into a side apartment,\r\nand with the diffidence of a girl, said, pointing to an exquisite\r\nlittle fern hardly so large as our forefinger, growing in the border\r\nunder some orange-plants, “There, I should not dare to tell anybody\r\nbut you that I have taken more real pleasure in that one little thing\r\nthan in all the whole establishment.” We perfectly understood him. The\r\nfern was of the most delicate sort. It seemed to hover between form\r\nand spirit,—if there be such a thing as soul in plant-life. All around\r\nit were large and vigorous plants growing lush and stalwart. This\r\ndainty little fairy fern appealed to the child-loving side of human\r\nnature, to the unworldly and uncommercial faculties. We always\r\nrespected Park the better for this weakness. No man can have such a\r\nsentiment for flowers, who has not in him feelings as fresh and\r\ndelicate as the flowers which he admires.\r\n\r\nBut with what complacency can such a one look upon the merchandise of\r\nflowers which is exhibited at every party, every wedding, every vulgar\r\njam of rich people, who torment themselves through untimely hours for\r\nthe sake of tormenting their host?\r\n\r\nLook at the atrocious bridal bouquets! The bride, the bridesmaids,\r\ncome forth bearing each a huge _melange_ of orange-blossoms and\r\nrosebuds, wedged together into a pyramidal wart of flowers! If,\r\ninstead, the bride were to issue forth bearing in her hand a sprig of\r\norange-blossoms just as it grew, just as it was plucked from the\r\nbranch, or two or three simple rosebuds on the one stem, loosely\r\nclustered, and with their own fresh green leaves, or a simple white\r\nlily, would not every one feel how superior flowers were for such an\r\noccasion, in their own simplicity and individuality, than when, as\r\ngenerally happens, they are smothered up in an artificial heap, in\r\nwhich all naturalness is utterly lost?\r\n\r\nA single blossom of carnation with a geranium leaf; an exquisite\r\nsaffrano rosebud just beginning to open, with a fresh leaf from its\r\nown bush for company; a stem of mignonette, girt round with a dozen\r\nfragrant blue violets; a long sprig of mauvandia-vine, with its\r\ncharming blue bells, hanging from a tall wineglass, or carelessly\r\ntrailing round it,—these, and such little things, confer a pleasure on\r\nthose who have a sensitive eye for grace and simplicity, which nothing\r\nelse can.\r\n\r\nWe would not be understood as objecting to all _masses_ of flowers,\r\nnor to large combinations. For coarser and more distant effects, they\r\nare permissible. But even then, the more they can be made to have a\r\nloose, airy, open habit, the finer will be their effect.\r\n\r\nBut first, simplicity, naturalness, singleness, and individualism in\r\nflowers; afterward and inferior, though permissible, artificial\r\nstructures and combinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nROSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           _July 2d._\r\n\r\nJune is the paradise of roses. In this month they break forth into\r\nunparalleled splendor. All Rosedom is out in holiday apparel; and\r\nroses white and black, green and pink, scarlet, crimson, and yellow,\r\nstriped and mottled, double and single, in clusters and solitary,\r\nmoss-roses, damask-roses, Noisette, perpetual, Bourbon, China, tea,\r\nmusk, and all other tribes and names, hang in exuberant beauty. The\r\nair is full of their fragrance. The eye can turn nowhere that it is\r\nnot attracted to a glowing bush of roses. At first one is exhilarated.\r\nHe wanders from bush to bush and cuts the finest specimens, until\r\nthere is no room or dish for more. So many roses, and so few to see\r\nthem! What would not people shut up in cities give to see such\r\nluxuriance of beauty! How strange that those who have ground do not\r\ngather about them these favorites of every sense! The air and soil\r\nthat nourish nettles and thistles, plantain and dock, would bring\r\nforth roses with equal kindness. There is enough ground wasted around\r\ncountry houses to furnish root-room for a hundred kinds of roses,\r\nwithout detriment either to fruit trees or ornamental shade trees. Men\r\nadmire them when they see them in a friend’s house; they are always\r\npleased to receive a lapful as a present to their wife or mother or\r\ndaughter; but it does not enter their head that they, too, might have\r\nroses to give away.\r\n\r\nRoses are easy of culture, easy of propagation, requiring almost as\r\nlittle care as dandelions or daisies. The wonder is that every other\r\nman is not an enthusiast, and in the month of June a gentle fanatic.\r\nFloral insanity is one of the most charming inflictions to which man\r\nis heir! One never wishes to be cured, nor should any one wish to cure\r\nhim. The garden is infectious. Flowers are “catching,” or the love of\r\nthem is. Men begin with one or two. In a few years they are struck\r\nthrough with floral zeal. Not bees are more sedulous in their\r\nresearches into flowers than many a man is, and one finds, after the\r\nstrife and heat and toil of his ambitious life, that there is more\r\npure satisfaction in his garden than in all the other pursuits that\r\npromise so much of pleasure and yield so little.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to find in men whose hard and loveless side you see in\r\nsociety, so much that is gentle and beauty-loving in private. Hard\r\ncapitalists, sharp politicians, grinding business men, will often be\r\nfound, at home, in full sympathy with the gentlest aspects of nature.\r\nOne is surprised to find how rich and sweet these monsters often turn\r\nout to be! Here is the man whom you have for years heard described, in\r\nall the newspapers, as a spectacle of wickedness or a monument of\r\nfolly. You are, by some convulsion of nature, thrown into his company,\r\nand travel for days with him. To your surprise his manners are gentle,\r\nhis conversation pleasing, his attentions to all about him\r\nconsiderate. This must be artifice. It is a veil to hide that hideous\r\nheart of which you have heard so much. You watch and wait. But\r\nwatching and waiting only satisfy you that this supposed monster is a\r\nkind man, with a world of sympathy for beautiful things. And when, in\r\nafter-months, you have been at his summer-house, and know him in his\r\nvineyard and his garden, you smile at yourself that you were ever\r\nsubject to that illusion which is so often raised about public men.\r\n\r\nA man is not always to be trusted because he loves fine horses, or\r\nbecause he follows the stream or hunts in the fields. But if a man\r\nthat loves flowers, and loves them enough to labor for them, is not to\r\nbe trusted, where in this wicked world shall we go for trust? A man\r\nthat carries a garden in his heart has got back again a part of the\r\nEden from which our great forefather was expelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nCHESTNUTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _July 30th._\r\n\r\nI fancy that trees have dispositions. At any rate, they have those\r\nqualities which suggest dispositions to all who are in sympathy with\r\nnature, and who look upon facts as letters of an alphabet, by which\r\none may spell out the hidden meanings of things. Some trees, like the\r\napple, suggest goodness and humility. They put on no airs. They do not\r\nexalt themselves. They are patient of climate, full of beauty in\r\nblossom, and, in autumn, beautiful in fruit.\r\n\r\nThe oak, when well grown, has the beauty of rugged strength, and\r\nsometimes it has grandeur. Certain live-oak trees on Helena Island,\r\nnear Beaufort, S. C., with long, pendant moss, like a Druid’s beard,\r\nimpressed us with a feeling of the sublime in vegetation which we\r\nnever experience in the presence of any other tree. Down on our backs\r\nwe lay, and gazed up into their vast tops with a pleasure never since\r\nrenewed. These were the types of patriarchal dignity.\r\n\r\nThe American elm is the tree of grace and beauty. It is stately\r\nwithout stiffness. It carries itself up to such a height that its\r\ndrooping boughs do not suggest feebleness, as the weeping-willow does.\r\nAnd yet, one never has the feeling of sympathy with it or of personal\r\nintercourse. One may sit under its branches, but no one ever sat on or\r\namong them. We admire, but do not sympathize. Still less did any one\r\never love a hickory-tree. They are beautiful and stately, but\r\nself-contained. When young, they are dandies; and when old,\r\naristocrats.\r\n\r\nNot so the chestnut-tree. This darling old fellow is a very\r\ngrandfather among trees. What a great, open bosom it has! Its boughs\r\nare arranged with express reference to ease in climbing. Nature was in\r\na good mood when the chestnut-tree came forth. It is, when well grown,\r\na stately tree, wide-spreading, and of great size. Even in the forest\r\nthe chestnut is a noble tree. But one never sees its full development\r\nexcept when it has grown in the open fields. It then assumes immense\r\nproportions. Having a tendency when cut down to send up many shoots\r\nfrom the stump, old trees are often found with four or five trunks\r\nspringing from the same root. In such cases, no other American tree\r\ncovers so wide a space of ground. Not even the oak attains to greater\r\nsize or longevity. The Tortworth chestnut, in England, is supposed to\r\nhave been standing before the Conquest, 1066, and must be not far from\r\na thousand years old. The longest known tree in America is the “Rice”\r\nchestnut, on the estate of Marshall I. Rice, at Newton Centre, Mass.\r\nIt measures twenty-four feet and three tenths in circumference at the\r\nbase, seventy-six feet in height, and spreads its limbs ninety-three\r\nfeet. It is vigorous, and still bears enormous crops. This, however,\r\nis a mere stripling compared with the famous chestnut-tree of Mount\r\nÆtna, whose trunk measured about one hundred and sixty feet in\r\ncircumference, or some fifty-three feet in diameter, and which could\r\nshelter a hundred horsemen beneath its branches! But this tree, long\r\nhollow, is about giving up the ghost, even if it has not already done\r\nso, no doubt dying in the peaceful consciousness of having spent a\r\nvirtuous life, and fed thousands of people with two thousand years’\r\nfull of nuts!\r\n\r\nThere is living in vigor at Sancerre, in France, a tree which, at six\r\nfeet from the ground, measures thirty feet in circumference. Michaux\r\nsays that he measured several trees in the Carolina mountains of\r\nfifteen or sixteen feet in circumference; which, if a boy is expected\r\nto climb them, is full large enough.\r\n\r\nA chestnut-tree in full bloom is a fine sight. It blossoms about the\r\nfirst of July, in clusters of long, yellowish-white filaments, like a\r\ntuft of coarse wool-rolls. The whole top of the tree is silvered over.\r\nWe have never seen them so finely in blossom as this year, and we\r\nforesee a grand harvest for the boys. O, those golden days of October!\r\nThe thought of them brings back the days of boyhood, the brilliant\r\nfoliage of the forest just putting on its regal garments; the merry\r\nsport of squirrels racing on the ground (if one lies dead-still to\r\nwatch), or scampering up the trunks, and leaping from tree to tree\r\nwith chirk and bark, if disturbed.\r\n\r\nIt was a great day when, with bag and basket, the whole family was\r\nsummoned to go “a-chestnuting!” There was frolic enough, and climbing\r\nenough, and shaking enough, and rattling nuts enough, and a sly kiss\r\nor two,—but never enough,—and lunch enough, and appetite enough. The\r\nsilver brook on the hillside carried down, on its murmuring current,\r\nthe golden leaves which the trees, with every puff of wind, sent\r\nshimmering down through the air. Barefooted, as we were all summer\r\nlong, the prickly chestnut burs were too sharp for our little tough\r\nfeet, and we were glad to pick our way cautiously under the trees.\r\n\r\nLong live the chestnut-tree, and the chestnut woods on the\r\nmountain-side, and the boys and girls who frolic under their boughs!\r\nAnd long live the winter nights, with the homely fare of apples and\r\nnuts, and no stronger drink than cider; and a merry crowd of boys and\r\ngirls, with here and there the spectacled old folks; all before a\r\nroaring hickory fire, in an old-fashioned fireplace, big as the\r\nwestern horizon with the sun going down in it, and with a roguish\r\nstick of chestnut wood in it, which opens such a fusillade of snaps\r\nand cracks as sets the girls to screaming, and throws out such\r\nmischievous coals upon the calico dresses, as obliges every humane boy\r\nto run to the relief of his sweetheart all on fire!\r\n\r\nNo doubt many an old gentleman will read this article with a face\r\ngrowing more and more full of smiles, and taking off his spectacles at\r\nthe end, and, looking kindly over at his aged dame, will say, “Do you\r\nremember, Polly, when we were at Squire Judson’s—” “Well, well,\r\nfather, you are too old to be talking about such youthful follies.”\r\nNevertheless, she smiles and looks kindly over at the old rogue who\r\nkissed her that night, proposed on the way home, and was married\r\nbefore Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nGREEN PEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _August 20th._\r\n\r\nWhat a comfort is the consciousness of usefulness! One may dig on his\r\nfarm or delve in his library for weeks, with nothing to show for it,\r\nand with no murmuring applause. But let him once spread the table, put\r\nthe pot to boiling, and set forth a meal; and the praise of\r\nhousekeepers begins to ascend, sweet as frankincense or new-made\r\napple-pies. But we are praise-proof in culinary matters. There are\r\nothers around here that are liable to the puffing-up of vanity, if\r\ntheir domestic performances are loudly applauded. But we, of the\r\nstronger sex, can hear our beefsteak commended without a wrinkle upon\r\nour tranquil humility. We can have our coffee criticised without a\r\nflush of indignation. Even our method of cooking vegetables may be\r\nundervalued, without exciting us to controversy; so tranquil is our\r\nsoul, when once under the inspiration of the _cuisine_. But some there\r\nare who mingle praise with suggestion—a cup of criticism with sugar in\r\nit. Thus:—\r\n\r\n     “We heartily thank him for his descriptions in ’summer\r\n     Dinners,’ and would mildly suggest, if he would add a pint\r\n     of nice, thick cream to a quart of peas, taken from milk\r\n     that has stood just six hours in a cool, airy, and clean\r\n     cellar—said milk must be milk, to start with; none of your\r\n     blue, watery stuff, such as some cows are said to give, but\r\n     rich, golden milk, caught in bright tin pails, so polished\r\n     that they reflect the happy faces of all who wish to take a\r\n     peep at them:—with such a dish, I think we could tempt—well,\r\n     Henry Ward, to dine with us; couldn’t we? especially if we\r\n     add an apple-pie made after a receipt you gave in the\r\n     _Ledger_ several years ago.\r\n\r\n              “Yours, very respectfully,\r\n                   “Twenty-year-old              DOT.”\r\n\r\nIf one wishes a new and composite dish, let the peas be smothered in\r\ncream. But, if one wishes _peas_, pure and simple, in their own\r\nflavor,—a flavor chosen out of the whole vegetable realm, and not\r\nrepeated in any other growing thing,—let him not, let her not,\r\naudaciously introduce any rival flavor. Peas are good; cream is good;\r\npeas and cream are good,—each in its own severalty. But let each one\r\nstand in its own name. Do not call peas and cream, peas. One’s\r\ntenderest culinary susceptibility is touched, to be asked if he will\r\ntake some green peas, and then to find himself eating peas and cream!\r\n\r\nThe English receipts recommend a sprig or two of mint to be thrown in\r\nwhile green peas are cooking. We do not challenge their right to do\r\nit. They may put in anise and cummin too, if they choose. But we do\r\nprotest, in the name of kitchen literature, against calling such\r\nexperimental compounds by the ever-dear name of “green peas.”\r\n\r\nAll smooth peas are tasteless compared with the wrinkled peas. It is\r\nproper that wrinkles should bring sweetness. The smooth-faced\r\nvarieties are fairer to look upon. But they are not inwardly rich.\r\nThat these should be flavored, enriched, and spiced with herbs, is not\r\naltogether against nature or analogy.\r\n\r\nStill, if on some bright summer day, soon after the twelve musical\r\nstrokes on the village bell, we shall find ourselves the guest of the\r\nsprightly “Dot,” we shall lay aside all pre-conceived notions and all\r\nprejudices; and if it prove to be that peas absorb cream into their\r\nbosoms without losing their peahood—nay, if this wedding shall prove,\r\nas all true weddings should, that individuality is developed and\r\nestablished—we shall gladly repent, confess, and recant our foregoing\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\nAnother fair heart has suffered itself to fall into shocking doubts.\r\n\r\n     “DEAR SIR: It is with great pleasure that I read your weekly\r\n     articles in the _Ledger_, and I have especially relished\r\n     your ’summer Dinner,’ which was got up in such good style.\r\n     But—and this is what is very important—did you have to ask\r\n     your wife the different names of the vegetables, and how to\r\n     cook them? Or do you believe in _Men’s Rights_, and so know\r\n     how to do your own cooking, seasoning, and eating?”\r\n\r\nThe family should be sacred! This attempt to pry into its secrets must\r\nnot succeed. This question answered, the next one would be, whether we\r\nwrote our own articles for the _Ledger_, or whether some one dictated\r\nthem to us? And then would come questions as to who wrote the sermons?\r\nThen, when once the stream had broken over the bounds of proper\r\nprivacy, it would rush through kitchen and pantry, closet and\r\ncupboard, cellar and attic, until the slime of curiosity would lie\r\nthick on all the sacred places of the household.\r\n\r\n“Ask our wife,” forsooth! We asked her once for all, some years ago,\r\nand the answer lasts, full and strong, until this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nHENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _April 22d._\r\n\r\nThe day is bright and windy. The sky has sunk back to the uttermost,\r\nand the arch seems wonderfully deep above your head. Little\r\ncloud-ships go sailing about in the heavens as busily as if they\r\ncarried freight to long-expectant owners. It is a day for the country.\r\nThe city palls on the jaded nerve. I long to hear the hens cackle.\r\nThere are lively times now in barn and barn-yard, I’ll warrant you. If\r\nI were lying on the east veranda of a cottage that I wot of, I should\r\nsee flocks of pure white Leghorns, wind-blown, shining in the\r\nsunlight, searching for a morsel in and out of the shrubbery, and hear\r\nthe cocks crowing, and the hens crooning. The Leghorn, of true blood,\r\nleads the race of fowls for continuous eggs, in season and out of\r\nseason; eggs large enough, of fine quality, and sprung from hens that\r\nnever think of chickens. For a true Leghorn seldom wants to sit. They\r\nbelieve in division of labor. They provide eggs; others must hatch\r\nthem. Other fowls may surpass them on the spit or gridiron, but, as\r\negg-layers, they easily take the lead. They are hardy, handsome, and\r\nimmensely productive. As it is just as easy to keep good fowls as poor\r\nones, thrifty housekeepers should secure a good laying breed. Not\r\nevery pure white fowl is a Leghorn. There are many White Spanish sold\r\nas Leghorns. They may be known by their gray or pearl-colored legs.\r\nThe pure Leghorn has a yellow leg, a single comb, quite long and\r\nusually lapping down. This breed is well known about New York, but no\r\ndescription of it can be found in English poultry-books. Indeed, we\r\nare informed that Tegetmayer, the standard authority, but recently\r\nknew anything about them, and then from a coop sent from New York.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmas and Cochins have good qualities. They are large, even\r\nhuge. They are peaceable, and the Cochins do not _scratch_,—an\r\nimportant fact to all who have a garden, and who yet desire to let\r\ntheir poultry run at large. They are good layers, admirable mothers,\r\nand yield a fine carcass for the table, but the meat is not fine,\r\nthough fairly good. But a more ungainly thing than buff Cochins the\r\neye never saw. A flock of Leghorns is a delight to the eye. One is\r\nnever tired of watching them. Their forms are symmetrical, and every\r\nmotion is graceful. But the huge poddy Cochins waddle before you like\r\nover-fat buffoons. They are grotesque, good-natured, clumsy, useful\r\ncreatures; but they have a great love of sitting. Every Cochin hen\r\nwould love to bring out two broods in a season; while the white\r\nLeghorns fill their nests with eggs, and then think their whole duty\r\ndone. We keep Cochin hens to sit on Leghorn eggs. Better mothers\r\ncannot be.\r\n\r\nI hear my hens cackle! These bright spring days are passing, and the\r\nconcert of the barn-yard is in full play, but I am tied up to the pen!\r\nCurrant-bushes are pushing out their blossom-buds; rhubarb is showing\r\nits red knuckles above the ground; willows are pushing out their silky\r\ncatkins; birds have come—everything has come but me! I cannot sprout\r\nyet. Patience! I shall be green enough in a few weeks. The city shall\r\nnot always prevail. In due season I shall go to grass. Already I smell\r\nit. The odor of new grass can be perceived but for a few days only in\r\nspring. It should be noticed then, for it is unlike any other perfume,\r\nand will be perceived no more until another year. How happy are they\r\nthat dwell among open fields,—or how happy they might be if they but\r\nknew their privileges!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nFARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _May 13th._\r\n\r\nIf one wishes to make money out of the soil, upon an Eastern farm, he\r\nmust live upon it, study it, watch it, calk and groove it so that no\r\nleak shall be possible, economize rigidly, work fearfully, sell the\r\nbest, use the unsalable,—in short, he must be a drudge or a genius.\r\nNot a genius in literature or art, but in money-making. Only think how\r\nsome old-fashioned New England ministers lived on a salary of four\r\nhundred dollars; educated seven or eight children; worked their farm\r\nduring the week, and preached on Sunday; and died rich, that is, worth\r\nanywhere from fifty to a hundred thousand dollars, which, fifty years\r\nago, was as much as two hundred and fifty thousand dollars are now;\r\nfor the purchasing power of gold and silver is steadily declining, and\r\nof course more of it is required for the same purposes.\r\n\r\nBut only now and then did such a man and minister turn up; and the\r\ngeneral impression, even in his case, was, that the farm was better\r\ntilled than the parish.\r\n\r\nBut the small farmers in the old States north of the Delaware have a\r\nhard life. If they get on, it is by vigorous economy following\r\nexcessive industry. There is a good deal of sentiment wasted on the\r\ndelights of farming. But in New England, we suspect that for every\r\nfarmer who lives in abundance or comparative ease, there are five, and\r\nperhaps ten, that fare coarsely, and are not half as well clothed and\r\nhoused as the average mechanic. First-rate farmers are few; third and\r\nfourth rate farmers are many, and a hard time they have. But as one\r\ngoes westward, to better soil, larger farms, and more congenial\r\nclimate, things change. Farmers are prosperous without such exacting\r\ntoil. Their dwellings grow better, particularly in the northern parts\r\nof Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and the great Northwest. If one has money\r\nand leisure, he may carry on a farm in the Eastern States with great\r\nenjoyment. That is as pleasant a way to spend money as can well be\r\ndevised, not even excepting the management of fast horses and fast\r\nyachts; for both of these deteriorate in the using, and some go under,\r\nwhile the farm steadily rises in value and force. But with the\r\nexception of the owners of uncommonly good land here and there, not\r\nmuch money is to be made at farming in the East. The farm is an\r\ninstitution designed to promote health and comfort in the expenditure\r\nof money. Money is the one manure which the farm greedily covets.\r\n\r\nWe say these things, not to discourage farming, but to dissuade the\r\nannual host from going out to make their fortunes on a farm, who, in\r\nfive years, will come back stripped bare of everything but disgust—not\r\nof that. No man would think of going from the law, or from a store,\r\ninto a mechanical trade without having served an apprenticeship, or\r\nhaving become in some way familiar with it. Lawyers do not set up at\r\ncabinet-making, nor go into steel works, nor set up for builders or\r\npainters. But when business is dull, and health delicate, many a\r\nprofessional man, many a clerk or unsuccessful merchant, concludes to\r\nbuy a “snug farm,” and retire from the cares of the town or city, to\r\nlead the joyous life of a farmer. He has no knowledge of farming; but\r\nit requires none! Farming is simple. You rise with the dewy morn; you\r\ngo forth to your prodigal acres; you rest under the trees bending with\r\nfruit; you eat from your bountiful table the food that sprung from\r\nyour own soil,—and ever so much more romance of the same sort.\r\n\r\nProsperous farming requires knowledge, tact at managing men, skill in\r\nlaying out work, incessant industry, very close calculations, good\r\njudgment in buying, and a good capacity of selling. In short, the\r\nqualities which go to make up a good merchant, a good manufacturer,\r\nand a good scientist ought to be combined in a first-class farmer.\r\nThere are more passable orators born every year than there are\r\nfirst-class farmers. If any one doubts the truth of these views, let\r\nhim try a farm for a few years!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nGARDENING UNDER DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not every one who can toss off his provocations with so good a\r\ngrace as our correspondent, whose letter we insert:—\r\n\r\n                                         NEW YORK, _April 19th_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MR. BEECHER: Suppose you were fond of flowers and\r\n     shrubs, and that the plat of Mother Earth allotted you was\r\n     at the back of your city house, say about seventeen feet\r\n     square,—the most of it occupied by the space for drying\r\n     clothes; the rest a hard clayey soil, baked by the sun so\r\n     quickly that you wish the Israelites might have had it to\r\n     make brick, and one that no amount of foreign admixture\r\n     improves.\r\n\r\n     Suppose the florist came every spring, hoed and raked, and\r\n     distributed roses, verbenas, geraniums, and the like, at\r\n     regular intervals, also sticks, bare evidence of the\r\n     burial-place of various cherished bulbs that never come up,\r\n     but seem, like your carnations, to disappear with the\r\n     wheelbarrow.\r\n\r\n     Suppose the occupants of the tenement-house close to your\r\n     rear fence,—who always, _in all the stories_ of the day,\r\n     nurse a geranium in a cracked pot,—instead of thanking you\r\n     for the pleasant sight under their windows, garnished your\r\n     bed with egg-shells, old paper collars, rags, bones, empty\r\n     spools, and other _débris_ handy for the purpose.\r\n\r\n     Suppose the nine thousand and ninety cats and their families\r\n     roosted on the fence in the twilight, and tried their claws\r\n     on your shrubs, and the softness of your soil generally, in\r\n     the small hours of the night.\r\n\r\n     Suppose, with the first green leaves, the worms came also,\r\n     and the green lice, and the ants, and made your bushes a\r\n     sorrow and a vexation.\r\n\r\n     Suppose the hoop of the laundress was over it all, so to\r\n     speak, and the hose always burst when the weather was dry,\r\n     and your watering-pot held about a teacupful.\r\n\r\n     What would _you_ do, Mr. Beecher? Would you give over the\r\n     space to old shoes and ugliness, or would you fly in the\r\n     face of _manifest destiny_ and cultivate?\r\n\r\n                   Dejectedly yours,\r\n                                                 BREEZE.\r\n\r\nThe very first thing to be done with a tenacious and obstinate clay\r\nsoil is to have it dug out and carted away bodily, and its place\r\nsupplied with good fresh loam. This would be a serious job if there\r\nwere several acres. But when there is but a plat of seventeen feet\r\nsquare, and the larger part of that reserved for laundry purposes,\r\nonly borders being used for flowers, the amount to be removed would be\r\ncomparatively small, and the satisfaction would be ample repayment.\r\nAny one with a cart can carry off the clay, but not every one can get\r\ngood soil. An honest florist or garden jobber could put you in the way\r\nof that.\r\n\r\nIf you will have a garden, it is best to be your own gardener. Adam\r\nand Eve set the example.\r\n\r\nThe cats may be managed in various ways. A black-and-tan terrier kept\r\nin the back yard has a wonderful influence on cats, arousing in them a\r\nstrong local prejudice. If the boys in the neighborhood knew that a\r\npremium were offered for cat scalps, it would be found greatly to\r\ninterest the cats. At any rate, their number would grow less.\r\n\r\nAs to worms and aphides, no one is fit to own flowers who, in so small\r\na space as seventeen feet square, cannot exterminate them,—worms by\r\nhand picking, and aphides by whale-oil soapsuds. A vigorous fidelity\r\nwill in a short time put the last worm _hors de combat_. The whale-oil\r\nsoap may be had at any large seed-store,—directions for use\r\naccompanying the little jar. A tin garden syringe may be had at the\r\nsame place, costing but little, lasting, with care, twenty years, and\r\ncarrying the soapsuds like spray over every leaf and twig.\r\n\r\nWe, too, in Brooklyn have _lawn dresses_ with equatorial hoops, and\r\nyet manage to have many a charming patch of flowers. But, of all\r\nthings in this world, a garden needs the presence of its owner. If you\r\ndo not love it enough to care for it as you would for a baby, better\r\nlet it alone. Flowers know who love them. They will not be put off\r\nwith arm’s-length cordiality. But, if you love them, you will easily\r\novercome a hundred obstacles, and rejoice in your flowers all the more\r\nbecause they are the trophies of your patience and industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nCORN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _September 19th._\r\n\r\nWe have artists who give themselves to specialties. One delights to\r\nknow fruits. Another loves architecture, or landscape, or figures, or\r\nanimals, or grasses and flowers. Now it has always seemed strange that\r\nthe noblest of all grasses, maize, or Indian corn, has never found an\r\nenthusiastic lover. It has been painted often, but never yet\r\ninterpreted. No one has done by it what has been done by the lily, the\r\nrose, the convolvulus.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, where shall we find any union of strength and grace more\r\nperfect among herbaceous plants? The jointed stem, robust and stiff,\r\ngives off at each articulation the most gracefully curved\r\nsword-leaves, which diminish in length as the plant goes up to its\r\nfimbriated top, forming a symmetrical whole not to be equalled among\r\nfield plants.\r\n\r\nIf one will wander along the edges of a cornfield, he will often see\r\nan exquisite picture, such as Nature loves to make. The wild\r\nconvolvulus, which often fills the fence corners, has crept out of the\r\ngrass into the furrow and twined around the corn, climbing to its very\r\ntop, and, having power yet to grow, returns upon itself and fashions\r\nfestoons of exquisite leaves and white blossoms, which hang down in\r\nevery negligent form of beauty. Other vines too, besides the\r\nconvolvulus, try their arts, and none fail; but none succeed so\r\ncharmingly as this queen of twining vines.\r\n\r\nA specialist might devote himself to corn without fear of exhausting\r\nthe subject. Of all the grains it is the true type of republicanism.\r\nIt knows how to live in the community without losing its\r\nindividuality. The smaller grains—wheat, barley, and such like—produce\r\ntheir effects only in masses. Individual stalks are quite\r\ninsignificant. It is the community, and not the individual, that is\r\nbeautiful. But a field of corn does not swallow up in itself the stems\r\nwhich form its mass. Every plant yet retains it nobility. If corn is\r\nsown so thickly that it cannot find room for development, the whole\r\ndegenerates into mere grass, and loses its proper force and beauty.\r\nBut the husbandman has found out what rulers yet but slowly learn, and\r\nreluctantly,—that the force and beauty of the whole is to be sought in\r\nthe development and strength of each single plant. Individuality and\r\ncommunity are not only compatible, but each is the indispensable\r\nfactor of the other.\r\n\r\nOr, turn the subject in another light. Each stalk of corn is a father\r\nand mother. It does not live for itself. When it hastens on in the hot\r\ndays of July, it is not its own beauty that it seeks. It takes that on\r\nthe way to a higher end. In the cool juices of that polished stem\r\nglows the sacred fire of parentage. The arched and rustling leaves\r\nborrow of the sun and air food for the coming brood. No sooner does\r\nthe tassel break forth at the top, than out peer the infant ears\r\nnestling at the side of the noble stem. Nor does the parent blossom\r\ninto its final beauty until the exquisite silk hangs from the nascent\r\nears of corn to feed upon the parent’s life, and in that find its own.\r\n\r\nNo sooner do the new-born kernels swell, than the parent bequeaths\r\nitself and all its inward stores to its offspring. The long leaves\r\nswing idly in the air, as things that have nothing more to do. Every\r\nday the winds evoke a shriller sound from their motions. When the cob\r\nhas covered itself with golden kernels, rich and ripe, the parent\r\ndies,—dies mourning sadly, shall we think? What though it shall live a\r\nhundred-fold in its children? All memory or consciousness will be\r\ngone. It has spent its life and beauty for others. But how strong, how\r\nfresh, how full, how beautiful its life, while doing its appointed\r\nwork! How little does it really care to live when the end of living is\r\naccomplished! It did the work at hand, and drew all its beauty from\r\nthat doing, then took its place in the great economy of nature,\r\nfalling back to nothing.\r\n\r\nWith such thoughts men looked upon the fields thousands of years ago,\r\nand sighed, “As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the\r\nfield, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is\r\ngone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.”\r\n\r\nIt was thousands of years afterward that one said, “As we have borne\r\nthe image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the\r\nheavenly…. Death is swallowed up in victory.”\r\n\r\nThe grass of the field may image forth the secular side of human life,\r\nbut it can go no further than the grave. Beyond that it cannot point.\r\nOnly one garden ever was that set forth the sure hope of immortality.\r\n“In the place where He was crucified, there was a garden…. There laid\r\nthey Jesus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nDANDELIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _June 8th._\r\n\r\nThere are many charms connected with the ideal life of the tropics.\r\nThe chief drawback is, that _manhood_ deliquesces and runs out under\r\nthe equator. This is not paid for by luscious bananas, oranges,\r\norchids, or ever-blooming vines and trees. Enjoyment palls when it\r\nflows unceasingly and without break. To live in summer forever,\r\nwithout one ungarlanded hour in the year, might, for aught we know,\r\nsate us with sweetness.\r\n\r\nThe tropics were not made to live in all the year. They are a refuge\r\nfor one or two months. After frost and snow have had their full meal,\r\nand the northern winds have by familiarity bred contempt and\r\ninfluenzas, it is a good thing to go to sleep on the good steamer Moro\r\nCastle, and wake up in Cuba, or Jamaica, or to go on through the Gulf\r\nof Mexico to the Magdalena valley in Northern South America, which the\r\npainter Church once told me he regarded as the most perfect climate\r\nthat he had ever found in all travels.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the contrast is satisfied, we are sure that one in the\r\ntropics must long for the northern zones, northern fruits and northern\r\nflowers; for calm days without pestilent insects; for _grass_, and for\r\nDANDELIONS!\r\n\r\nNow I have got upon my real subject. The foregoing sentences were in\r\nthe nature of a rhetorical introduction,—a sly and adroit way of\r\ngetting people to listen to the praises of one of the brightest charms\r\nof our northern spring days.\r\n\r\nI am moved to celebrate this brilliant, and yet, I fear, not\r\nmuch-prized flower, from the glory of my morning view. Out of my back\r\nwindows I look down on four or five grassy yards, all well kept and\r\nlying well open to the sun. Soon after the grass springs you may see\r\nsuch a gorgeous array of dandelions as might make a florist fairly\r\nenvious! They jut out from the edges of the walks, they crowd the\r\nnarrow strips of grass at the lower end, they fairly jostle each other\r\nlike a crowd pouring out of a public hall, in their strife to get into\r\nthe light and open their golden crowns to the sun.\r\n\r\nSo brilliant are they and so hardy, that we are apt to miss the\r\nsentiment that lives in them. They are not of the flowers that\r\nimpudently push themselves forward, demanding us to look at them\r\nwhether we will or no. With all their amazing brilliancy, they are\r\nstill coy love-flowers, that wait for the sun, as a bride for the\r\nbridegroom. For dandelions do not wake up in the morning before we do.\r\nThey wait till the sun has long called them, and then they fling open\r\ntheir golden disks, and shine with a real delight of existence, with a\r\ncheer and abundance which ought to strike joy into the heart of a\r\nmisanthrope.\r\n\r\nSoon after noon is at its highest, the dandelion, thinking that the\r\nworld is bright enough, and that the sun can manage the rest of the\r\nday, folds itself up, laces the golden filaments with the green\r\nlepals, and retires to meditation. Thus it plays courtier in the\r\nmorning, and nun in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nBut what a name! _Dens leonis!_ or _Dent-de-lion!_ Or, if you fly to\r\nthe systematic name,—the harsh _Taraxacum!_ Shall such a home-loving,\r\nradiant creature be called _Lion’s Tooth_, because some impertinent,\r\nprying botanist fancied that he had espied the shape of a lion’s tooth\r\nin its minor forms?\r\n\r\nJust as soon as we have got politics settled, business reformed, and\r\nhuman nature elevated, I am determined to form a society for the\r\nreformation of botanical names. Botany has been the Noah’s Ark of\r\npedants. Every absurd whim of every pragmatical professor has been\r\nturned into Greek or Latin, and hung about the neck of unhappy flower.\r\nOne might as well hang a dictionary around a child’s neck by way of\r\nornament, as to impose on flowers such outrageous and outlandish names\r\nas now defend the science of botany from all approach, as a fort is\r\ndefended by a line of _chevaux-de-frise_.\r\n\r\nBut blessings on those cheery children of the sun! They are born of\r\nbrightness; their whole life is like a smile of love. They are not a\r\nflower for the hand; they are not to be worn in the bosom. They do not\r\nlove the house, or the pressure of a close bouquet. Their life is in\r\nthe free open air. They shine out on you along your daily walk. They\r\ncrowd your yard with golden coin, which, good for nothing in the\r\nmarket, may yet have the power to confer more enjoyment than could\r\ngolden dollars or ducats.\r\n\r\nThis is my annual tribute. To-day I look out of my window, and thank\r\nGod for the gifts which he sends me by the hand of Dandelions! Do they\r\nknow my thoughts as I gaze on them? Is there not some sympathy between\r\nthings in nature which wake up the soul to delight, and aid the soul\r\nthus aroused? Behind signs and signals, back of all articulate\r\nutterance, may there not be a subtler relationship which will yet be\r\ndiscovered, as connecting the inward and the outward with a living\r\nrelationship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nHOW TO BEAUTIFY HOMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _August 25th._\r\n\r\nNo one needs to be told how much a house is adorned by _vines_; and\r\nyet many are averse to their liberal use from the impression that they\r\nmake a house damp. It is true that they _may_, but it is not necessary\r\nthat they should. Vines do not _collect_ dampness. If any part of the\r\nhouse wall needs the sun to warm it, and is covered by a vine from its\r\ninfluence, it may favor dampness. But an ivy vine, on the other hand,\r\nis reputed to make a wall dry, and has sometimes been employed to\r\ncorrect the undue moisture to which certain portions of a dwelling are\r\nsubject. A grape vine, trained upon slats, which shall have a few\r\ninches of air-space underneath it, will not injure the house. Upon\r\nporches, over trellises, vines may be trained with charming effect,\r\nand without offending those who are superstitiously prejudiced against\r\nvines on the house.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of vines must be left, in the case of thousands, to\r\naccident. Men that are obliged to count the very last penny in their\r\nexpenses cannot send many orders to florists for beautiful things, but\r\nmust take what they can get in their own neighborhood. We will mention\r\na few things now generally diffused.\r\n\r\nThe _Glycine_, or _Wistaria_, is one of the noblest. It will run a\r\nhundred feet or more, and grow in time to have a trunk like a small\r\ntree. Nothing can surpass it at its blossoming period. It is like a\r\nvision of the garden of heaven. It may be raised by _layers_, but will\r\nbe found somewhat slow in taking hold after transplantation. Its arms\r\nmay be carried out in tier above tier to cover the whole side of the\r\nhouse, when economy of space is no object; but where one desires to\r\nspare for other things, the _Wistaria_ may be trained upon a corner,\r\nor along the eaves.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more beautiful in its summer greenness or gorgeous in\r\nits autumn reds and purples, than the Virginia Creeper—_Ampelopsis\r\nhederacea_. There is a variety called _Ampelopsis Veitchii_, or\r\nVeitch’s, which is extremely beautiful. It clings to wood or brick\r\nwith as much tenacity as the ivy. Its foliage is fine, and its habit\r\nfits it to fill small spaces. It is a plant that, having once owned,\r\nno one would part with.\r\n\r\nIf one wishes a dense screen, there is no vine that grows more rapidly\r\nor that is more hardy than the _Aristoloicha sipho_, or Dutchman’s\r\npipe. One might as well attempt to look through a brick wall as\r\nthrough the opaque mass made by its enormous leaves. But its\r\ncoarseness fits it chiefly for hiding ungainly things or shading from\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\nThe _Trumpet Creeper_ is effective at a distance, but its coarseness\r\nexcludes it from familiar nearness.\r\n\r\nFew people are aware of the vast improvements which have taken place\r\nin the _Clematis_. Every one knows the wild white clematis, which is\r\nbeautiful in blossom, and almost as fine when its seeds are ripened.\r\nIt abounds in our fields, and bears transplantation easily. The new\r\nkinds, or those comparatively new, deserve to be better known.\r\nFortune’s, Henderson’s, Jackman’s, the Prince of Wales, Standish’s,\r\ntogether with Helena, Sophia, Lanuginosa, are obtainable at our\r\nfirst-class nurseries, and may be easily propagated. Besides these,\r\nthere are every year new varieties introduced. There is no vine that\r\nwe should spare with more reluctance. The sheets of gorgeous bloom,\r\nwhich, by judicious selection of kinds, will last from June to\r\nSeptember, the perfect hardiness of the plant, and the ease with which\r\nit is trained, fit it eminently for small places and sunny spots. For\r\nit loves the full blaze, and will not flourish well even when planted\r\nwith other vines that at all shade it. Indeed, to have the best effect\r\nof clematis, it should be trained in a clear and open space to a\r\ntrellis of its own.\r\n\r\nBut, of all vines, none is more popular, and deservedly so, than the\r\nhoneysuckle. The kinds are numerous. But if but one can be had, let it\r\nbe the _Halleana_, or Hall’s Japan honeysuckle. It cannot be\r\ndistinguished from the _Brachypoda_, in leaf or blossom; but it excels\r\nthat immeasurably in the habit of blossoming all summer. The\r\n_Flexuoso_, or Chinese, is fine, but we consider it second to Hall’s,\r\nwhich ought to be better known and more widely diffused than it is. By\r\nplanting it on open soil, without support, it spreads over the ground,\r\nand roots at every joint, so that hundreds of new plants may be gained\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful golden honeysuckle—_aurea reticulata_. This ought\r\nnot to be planted by the side of green-leaved varieties. It produces\r\nthe effect of a diseased or weak branch, rather than of contrast and\r\nvariety. But the golden-leaved, if planted by itself, and well grown,\r\nis gorgeous. It is perfectly hardy, and is of good growth and\r\nconstitution. If one has a yard of ground, he may have a vine which\r\nwill give unfeigned pleasure through the whole summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nBIRCH AND ASPEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _September 28th._\r\n\r\nLooking out from my window upon the dark sides of the mountains, upon\r\nthe massive clouds, upon the wind-blown trees, I see my pet, the\r\nbirch, all in a shiver with each blast. The American white birch has\r\nall the grace and delicacy of its European namesake, and, besides, a\r\nsensibility which it borrows from the aspen, or shares with it.\r\n\r\nOne should have, on every side of a country house, a group of aspens\r\nand birches. Planted together, they will give you motion in charming\r\nvariety. On other trees the leaves are so rigid in the stem, that a\r\nwind strong enough to set them in full activity is strong enough to\r\nset all the branches in motion. We recognize the force, and, in large\r\ntrees, the grandeur of motion. When a strong wind moves the whole\r\ntree, it swings its great boughs hither and thither, all its leaves\r\nand twigs utter their voices, which in chorus often rise to a roar.\r\nYet, though the whole tree is agitated, and seems convulsed, one sees\r\nthat it is only upon the exterior; while the top and sides are in full\r\nmotion, the trunk stands firm, and seems motionless. Not till its very\r\nroots give way will it move, and then it does not bend, but goes down\r\nwith stiff trunk.\r\n\r\nThe elastic birch, with long and slender limbs, avoiding horizontal\r\npositions and aiming at the zenith, flexible to the last degree, moves\r\nin the wind with a grace and elasticity which has no parallel.\r\n\r\nThe American aspen has a shivering leaf upon a rigid branch. It stands\r\nquite stiff and motionless in bough, while its leaves are quivering\r\nand shivering in the most industrious manner. Right over against the\r\neast door of the Twin Mountain House, New Hampshire, at a little\r\ndistance, is a group of aspens, which are my perpetual delight. They\r\nare my wind-meters, or, rather, zephyr measurers. On a hot noon, when\r\nno air seems stirring, and the trees about them doze and slumber, like\r\ngood men at church, these twinklers, like roguish boys, are dancing in\r\nan imaginary breeze, and playing with themselves, without a particle\r\nof wind, so far as I can perceive. Now a shiver runs over them from\r\nhead to foot; then the topmost leaves shake and swirl, while the\r\nbottom rests. Gradually the motion dies away all over, and the frolic\r\nends. No, a single leaf begins to wag; it goes on in single\r\nblessedness, with accelerated pace, up and down, round and round,\r\nuntil, for the life of me, I cannot help bursting into a fit of\r\nlaughter at this solitary dance.\r\n\r\nAt times, in certain moods, one cannot help thinking that the aspen is\r\nstriving to communicate something. It seems so sigh and pant. It\r\nsupplicates as one that suffers. Then, changing suddenly, it coaxes\r\nand winks and blinks at you as if it was only in fun. It will stand\r\nperfectly still a minute as if looking to see what you will do, and\r\nthen a laughing ripple runs all over it. It frolics with the same\r\ntireless grace as a kitten. Indeed, it is a kind of compound\r\nkitten-tree, each particular leaf a kitten, all frolicking together;\r\nthough there is not one of them, if the rest won’t play, that is not\r\nready, kitten-like, as it were, to chase its own tail.\r\n\r\nWhy have landscape gardeners done so little with birches and aspens?\r\nMaples, oaks, ashes, and evergreens are well; but in what other\r\ndirection shall we look for such grace in form, such susceptibility to\r\naerial influences, and such exquisite motion both of branch and leaf,\r\nas we find in the aspen and birch? The birches grow rapidly, are\r\nextremely hardy, and will flourish upon poor soil, though loving a\r\ngenerous soil better. In ten years, with birch and aspen, one may\r\nrejoice in a thick grove. If the yellow locust be added to these, and\r\nthe silver maple, one who plants at sixty may hope to see high over\r\nhis head a respectable young forest, dense enough for shade and high\r\nenough to begin to comfort the imagination.\r\n\r\nLong live the aspen and the birch! Only the young have just grounds\r\nfor prejudice; but even boys soon outgrow the birch, and watch its\r\nsinewy motion without a thought of moving too, in shivering accord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nAUTUMN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _November 2d._\r\n\r\nThe summer is gone. The autumn is here. Not this year, as last, in the\r\nplenitude of color, but more soberly, frugally, and sedately. The\r\nautumn of 1871 was eminently a color season. Only once in three or\r\nfour years does Nature make a full pallet. Then the colors are pure,\r\nintense, tender, and fresh. Such was last year. The scarlets were\r\nbrilliant, the orange was pure, the crocuses and yellows were clear\r\nand rich. But, as autumnal days steal upon us now, we see already that\r\nwe shall have picture-forests of only second or third rate brilliancy.\r\nThe hickories are of a rusty and spotted golden brown. The maples are\r\nfine, yet not exquisite.\r\n\r\nThe sumach is always brilliant. So are some of the vines. The\r\npepperidge-tree (_Nyssa sylvatica_) is very fine. If any one doubts\r\nit, let him go over to Prospect Park, in Brooklyn, not far from the\r\nstone cottage, on the south side, and he will have an opportunity to\r\nreview his opinion, and to wonder why it is that one of the most\r\nmagnificent color trees of the American forests is so little known or\r\nintroduced into decorated grounds. It ranks among the very first in\r\nmerit, and stands among the very last in use.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the parks of New York and Brooklyn should be used for\r\nsomething else and more than mere walking and driving. They are the\r\nbest schools that America possesses for the study of trees and shrubs.\r\nThere are few things which our climate will allow to grow that may not\r\nbe found here, under circumstances which tend to produce their most\r\nfavorable development. Gentlemen who have country places may, by some\r\nlittle pains, here see just what things they need, how to combine them\r\nfor the best effects, and how to provide for them soil and site. Once\r\npossessed, the love of trees becomes a passion, and inspires more\r\npleasure than one can imagine who has never become an enthusiast in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nOne may learn, particularly in the Brooklyn Park, the value of the new\r\n_golden_ evergreens of various sorts. They are destined to work a\r\nrevolution in yards and gardens. Some of the more choice ones are\r\nmarvels of brilliancy, and carry their glowing yellows right through\r\nthe winter. One may learn in these parks how to decorate _rocks_.\r\nThere is many a place in the country abounding in outcropping ledges,\r\nhuge bowlders, or jutting rocks, which the proprietor wishes he could\r\ndig out and cart away. But he is rich who has large rocks upon his\r\ngrounds. If one will see what use can be made of them, what a frame\r\nthey furnish for mosses, ferns, vines, and various elegant shrubs, he\r\nwill cease foolishly spending money to get rid of that which many men\r\nwould gladly spend money to obtain.\r\n\r\nIt is a fortunate thing for our country that so much attention is now\r\npaid to the planting of trees. We hope to see the day when no longer\r\nninety-nine in every hundred that are planted in streets or yards\r\nshall be maples and elms. What a sight would be a road on which one\r\ncould ride for a mile through an avenue of scarlet oaks, and then for\r\na mile through stately avenue of tulip-trees, and then through lines\r\nof scarlet maples, pepperidge-trees, cypress, or long rows of\r\ngentlemanly walnut-trees! The time will come when, on the great roads,\r\none may travel a whole day in the shade of stately trees.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to plant your own grounds. Every village should line\r\nits streets with shade trees. It is not enough to plant shade trees in\r\nthe streets. They ought to outrun the town, and reach from village to\r\nvillage, until the whole region is filled with shadowed roads. In\r\ndoing this, we ought to avoid the monotony of a few varieties\r\nendlessly reproduced, and make a generous use of the noble sorts that\r\nare so abundantly scattered over our forests and fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\nPLANT TREES!\r\n\r\n\r\nApril is the time for planting trees. Too much cannot be said to\r\ninduce people to fill their villages, and the great roads between\r\nvillage and village, with fine shade trees, and private grounds with\r\nthe choicer kinds. To write a good hymn or plant a good tree makes one\r\na benefactor to his generation.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be expected that the old men, hard-working, and with\r\nenough to do at any rate, will trouble themselves to plant trees along\r\npublic roads. But we may hope for such service from enterprising young\r\nmen, and even more from the public spirit of young women. Several\r\ninstances have come to our knowledge in which women have formed\r\nassociations for beautifying towns and villages by tree-planting, and\r\nin a few years have transformed the places. Nor is it unworthy of\r\nmention that this has been done by the influence of articles in the\r\n_New York Ledger_. A tree-planting week might be made a festival week;\r\nor persons might agree to secure a given number during the season.\r\n\r\nAnd here it may be well to say, that, although spring and fall are the\r\nbest seasons for transplanting, yet trees may be moved in any month in\r\nthe year,—in the middle of August, if need be. A long row of\r\nmaples, in Peekskill, were moved—in consequence of grading and\r\nfence-building—during the month of July, and only two of them\r\nexperienced any permanent injury.\r\n\r\nBut it should be borne in mind that only _small_ trees should be\r\nremoved in hot months, and after the foliage is expanded, unless one\r\nhas a mind to go to great expense. But trees six or eight feet high,\r\nif taken with ample roots, and especially if moved in damp or wet\r\nweather, may be safely transplanted in midsummer. Of course, it will\r\nrequire twice the care and labor which the same tree would need in\r\nspring, to produce the same result.\r\n\r\nThe three or four trees usually planted in grounds are maples, elms,\r\nhorse-chestnuts, and locusts. These are very well. But there are many\r\nkinds of maple seldom seen that deserve a place; such as the English\r\nfield maple (_Acer compestre_), and notably the American red maple,\r\ncalled swamp maple (_Acer rubrum_), the former for its finely cut\r\nleaves, and the latter for early blossoms and for the exquisite\r\nscarlet autumn hues of its leaves.\r\n\r\nThe cut-leaf or fern-leaf white birch is now common in nurseries. It\r\ngrows rapidly, is extremely graceful, has leaves delicate as a fern,\r\nand in winter throws against the sky a tracery of twigs which is\r\nbeautiful to look upon. It ought to be in every small collection. The\r\n_liquidomen_ has a very beautiful leaf, star-like, and changes in\r\nautumn to a purplish bronze, quite distinct from all other leaves. If\r\none can get the _tupelo_, which abounds in New England, and may be\r\nfound in some nurseries, he will secure a tree much neglected, but\r\nwhich ought to be universally diffused.\r\n\r\nFew people know how beautiful is the sassafras-tree, when well grown.\r\nIn the woods it is hardly more than a shrub, or scrawny tree; but when\r\nplanted young in an open space, and in good soil, it has a peculiar\r\nbeauty of its own which is not repeated in any other tree.\r\n\r\nWhy are magnolias so seldom planted? They are as hardy as maples—some\r\nof them at least. The _M. conspicua_, the _M. soulangiana_, _M.\r\nglanca_, and _M. tripetala_ are easily had, are fine all summer, and\r\nare the glory of the spring when their flowers expand.\r\n\r\nThe American and the English beech, and also the purple beech, should\r\nbe more often planted. An old beech-tree, grown on good soil, in an\r\nopen field, and not mutilated, has nothing to fear when standing among\r\nall the kings of trees. No trees that we saw in England impressed us\r\nas did the beeches at Warwick Castle.\r\n\r\nIn street planting, and along roadsides, nothing could be finer than\r\nthe tulip-tree, which grows rapidly, is clean, and bears fine blossoms\r\nin early summer. They should be transplanted when small, as they\r\neasily die off if moved when large. The same is true of chestnuts,\r\nwalnuts, and pecan-nuts.\r\n\r\nOf evergreens I shall not speak, as they deserve a separate mention.\r\nBut do not plant them in the city, nor in any close yard. They do not\r\nthrive, and become disfigurements rather than ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nFAREWELL TO “SUMMER REST.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this bright October day I know, not what Eve felt in leaving\r\nParadise, but what John Milton imagined that she felt. To be sure, I\r\nhave no such garden as hers must have been, and besides, I leave at a\r\ndifferent season of the year; for she inquires feelingly, “Who now\r\nshall train these flowers?” whereas my flowers are so nearly spent\r\nthat there is no need of training them. Tuberoses are gone, verbenas\r\nare gone, phloxes, common roses, and all the garden tribe, except\r\nscarlet sage, faithful marigolds, that never flinch to the last, and\r\npetunias, that are more graceful than they, and full as constant.\r\nBesides, there is the slow-footed chrysanthemum, too late for summer,\r\noften too late for autumn,—that never gets its Sunday jacket on until\r\nit is time to take it off again. But the amplitude of the floral\r\nharvest has been reaped. Now we only glean. Still one leaves a home of\r\ntwo months—summer months—not without a fluttering somewhere about the\r\nheart. The still days, the deep days, the mellow days, without\r\ntaxation or excitement, are over. Now for the plunge and rush! Now for\r\n_men_. Farewell, Nature!\r\n\r\nGood by, top of the hill! from which not a dwelling can be seen, only\r\nan horizon of mountains; and where, so often, just after the sun sets,\r\nwe have lingered alone, in the mystery and inexplicable delight of an\r\nevening solitary hour, lifted far above the surrounding earth, and\r\nalmost as one suspended in the very ether.\r\n\r\nGood by, homely stone wall! along which have grown so many weeds which\r\nwe naughtily admired and cherished, contrary to good farming manners;\r\nwhere so many shrubs, finding good soil, shot up into thickets laced\r\nwith wild grape vines. Old tumble-down stone wall! Every stone colored\r\nand built over with weather-stains of hard moss; stones covered with\r\nbrilliant ampelopsis, with the three-leaved ivy, fair to see, foul to\r\ntouch, and with the rampant bitter-sweet! Let no one despise a stone\r\nwall, nor judge of it only from the cow’s point of view. It is the\r\ncity of refuge to all the little fry. Squirrels run in and out, with\r\nsaucy alertness, every summer’s day. Hares and rabbits find it a\r\nbulwark. The hoary old fat woodchuck rejoices in it as in a fenced\r\ncity. Birds, too, wrens and sparrows, creep in and out, like children\r\nplaying bo-peep. On these sturdy stones have we sat hours and hours,\r\nasking no softer cushion, and desiring no finer spectacle than God\r\nsent down from the heavens, or displayed upon the earth. The winter\r\nwill soon vault into my seat, and a white shroud cover down the\r\nneglected old wall on the hill-top! Good by!\r\n\r\nNeither can a sensitive nature forget his summer companions, or stint\r\nthem in their meed of praise and gratitude. Worms whose metamorphosis\r\nwe have watched; spiders whose webs glitter along the grass at morning\r\nand at evening, or mark out geometric figures among the trees,—spiders\r\nred, brown, black, green, gray, yellow, and speckled; soft-winged\r\nmoths, gorgeous butterflies, steel-colored and shining black crickets,\r\nlocusts, and grasshoppers, and all the rabble of creaking, singing,\r\nfiddling fellows besides, which swarm in air and earth,—we bid you all\r\na hearty good-by. Sooth to say, we part from some of you without\r\nregret. But for the million we feel a true yearning,—so much have we\r\nwatched your ways, so many hours has our soul been fed by you through\r\nour eyes. Ye are a part of the Great Father’s family.\r\n\r\nO, how goodly a book is that which God has opened in this world! Every\r\nday is a separate leaf,—nay, not leaf, but volume, with text and note\r\nand picture, with every dainty quip and quirk of graceful art, with\r\nstores of knowledge illimitable, if one will only humble himself to\r\nreceive it!\r\n\r\nOne should not willingly be ungrateful, even to the smallest\r\ncreatures, or to inanimate objects, that have served his pleasure. And\r\nso, to reed and grass, bush and tree, stone and hill, brook and lake,\r\nall creeping things and all things that fly, to early birds and late\r\nchirping locusts, we wave our hand in grateful thanks!\r\n\r\nBut to that Providence over all, source of their joy and mine, what\r\nwords can express what every manly heart must feel? Only the life\r\nitself can give thanks for life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASANT TALK\r\n\r\nABOUT\r\n\r\nFRUIT, FLOWERS AND FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe understand very well that every region must fashion its _system_ of\r\nagriculture upon the nature of its soil, its climate, etc. The\r\n_principles_ of agriculture may be alike in every zone, but the\r\n_processes_ depend upon circumstances. It would be folly for a new\r\ncountry, without commerce, to imitate an old country with an active\r\ncommerce; it would be folly, where land is cheap, abundant, and\r\nnaturally fertile, to adopt the habits of those who are stinted in\r\nlands, who have a redundant population, and who find a market for even\r\nthe weeds which are indigenous to the soil. The husbandry of Holland\r\nis suited to a wet soil, and of England to a humid atmosphere and a\r\nvery even annual temperature. But our soil is subject to extreme wet\r\nin spring and dryness in summer, to severe cold and intense heat. A\r\nfarm whose bottom-lands are reinvigorated by yearly inundations, may\r\nthrive under an exacting husbandry that would exhaust an upland farm\r\nin a few years. Modes of agriculture must be suited to circumstances.\r\nNevertheless, the experiments and discoveries and practices of every\r\nland are worth our careful attention. We do not import _clothes_—but\r\nwe do _cloth_, to be _made up_ to suit our own habits and wants.\r\n\r\nThe two extremes of husbandry are, the _adoption_ of every novelty and\r\nevery experiment indiscriminately, and the _rejection_ of every new\r\nthing and every improvement, as indiscriminately. Wisdom consists in\r\n“proving all things and holding fast that which is _good_.” We do not\r\nadvocate large outlays for expensive machines—for fancy cattle, for\r\nevery new thing that turns up. But when, after full trial, it is\r\nascertained what are the best farm horses, the best breed of cattle,\r\nthe best milch cows, the most profitable breed of hogs and sheep, and\r\nthe most skillful routine of cultivation, we think our farmers ought\r\nto profit by the knowledge. It is never a good economy to have poor\r\nthings when you can just as well have the best. This, then, is\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR CREED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe in small farms and thorough cultivation.\r\n\r\nWe believe that soil loves to eat, as well as its owner, and ought,\r\ntherefore, to be manured.\r\n\r\nWe believe in large crops which leave the land better than they found\r\nit—making both the farmer and the farm rich at once.\r\n\r\nWe believe in going to the bottom of things and, therefore, in deep\r\nplowing, and enough of it. All the better if with a sub-soil plow.\r\n\r\nWe believe that every farm should own a good farmer.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the best fertilizer of any soil, is a spirit of\r\nindustry, enterprise, and intelligence—without this, lime and gypsum,\r\nbones and green manure, marl and guano will be of little use.\r\n\r\nWe believe in good fences, good barns, good farmhouses, good stock,\r\ngood orchards, and children enough to gather the fruit.\r\n\r\nWe believe in a clean kitchen, a neat wife in it, a spinning-piano, a\r\nclean cupboard, a clean dairy, and a clean conscience.\r\n\r\nWe firmly disbelieve in farmers that will not improve; in farms that\r\ngrow poorer every year; in starveling cattle; in farmers’ boys turning\r\ninto clerks and merchants; in farmers’ daughters unwilling to work,\r\nand in all farmers ashamed of their vocation, or who drink whisky till\r\nhonest people are ashamed of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALMANAC FOR THE YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. WORK FOR JANUARY.—If you have done as you ought to have done, you\r\nhave a snug ice-house, with double walls, the space between which is\r\nfilled with non-conducting substances, as pulverized charcoal, or\r\ndried saw-dust, or tanbark, which are mentioned in the order of their\r\nvalue. Cut your blocks of ice of a size and shape with reference to\r\nclose packing. Cover over thickly with clean straw when the stock of\r\nice is all in. Look out not to lose all your chance in waiting for a\r\nbetter one; sometimes careful folks mean to have such glorious ice,\r\nthat an open winter cheats them out of any at all.\r\n\r\nWARMTH.—The best fire in winter is made up of _exercise_, and the\r\npoorest, of _whisky_. He that keeps warm on liquor is like a man who\r\npulls his house to pieces to feed the fire place. The prudent and\r\ntemperate use of liquor is to let it alone. If you don’t touch it, it\r\ncertainly won’t hurt you; he that says there is no danger, boasts that\r\nhe is something more than other men.\r\n\r\nThe way to summer your cattle well is to winter them well; and half\r\nthe secret of good wintering is _to keep them warm_. Animal heat is\r\ngenerated in proportion to the abundance and excellence of their food.\r\nExposure to the cold air withdraws heat rapidly, and of course makes\r\nmore food necessary to re-supply it, just as an open door makes it\r\nnecessary to have more wood in the stove. If your stock run down in\r\nthe winter and come out lean and feeble, all the summer will not fully\r\nbring them up again.\r\n\r\n2. WORK FOR FEBRUARY.—Get out rails, both for present use, and for the\r\nfence which you expect to lay in March and April. Cut, haul and stack\r\nup near your house a good supply of _fire-wood_; no matter if the\r\nforest is within ten rods of your door, your wife ought to have her\r\nwood chopped and dried ready for use. Look at every fence upon the\r\nplace; see if the corners of your rail fences are rotting down; if\r\nsome rails have not broken; if pig-holes have not been made; if boys\r\nand cattle have not thrown down top-rails; and in short, put your\r\nfences into proper repair.\r\n\r\nOf course your tools will now be overhauled; those with steel blades\r\nshould be thoroughly cleansed when laid aside in the fall, and if you\r\nrub a little oil over them and hang them up, all the better. Repair\r\nall that are out of order. These things and all your ordinary work,\r\nmay be done; and still leave you leisure for _reading_. You should\r\nhave good books and good papers, and read them carefully for your own\r\nsake and for your children’s. A man who brings up a family of ignorant\r\nchildren, cheats his children of their rights, and cheats his country\r\nof its rights; it is therefore a crime.\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK.—If there be no snow on the ground, the gardens may be\r\ncleared of all rubbish, manure hauled and stacked carefully; and if\r\nyou have a clay soil, and can catch the ground without frost for a few\r\ndays, it will mellow and ameliorate it to spade it up, leaving it in\r\nlumps and heaps, through which the frost may thoroughly penetrate.\r\n\r\nIt is time to prepare your hot-bed, if you design having early plants\r\nin your garden.\r\n\r\n3. WORK FOR MARCH.—Begin the year by thorough, deep plowing, where\r\nyour fields are in good order for it. Depend upon it, that deep\r\nplowing is the only good plowing. Your first crop, generally, will\r\ntell you so. But if the subsoil is such that the first crop is rather\r\npoor, a year’s exposure of the land will ameliorate it so that your\r\nsecond crop will remunerate all expenses of time and labor laid out in\r\ndeep plowing. No farmer should be without a subsoil plow who has got\r\nhis lands clear of stumps and roots.\r\n\r\nTake especial care of cows now just coming in with calf. See that\r\nthose which are heavy are carefully handled, well fed, and warmly\r\nsheltered. Mares with foal should be tenderly used, exercised a\r\nlittle, but not put to hard or straining work. _The condition of the\r\nmother will to a great extent determine the condition of the\r\noffspring._ Cows, mares, sows, ewes, etc. etc., should be kept in a\r\nhearty condition, without being _fat_.\r\n\r\nORCHARD.—Do not trouble your trees with premature pruning. Let the\r\naxe, and knife, and saw alone. Loosen the dirt or sod around and\r\nbeneath your trees. The best manure for your trees is fresh mold, or\r\nforest soil and lime in the proportion of about one part to ten. Take\r\nsoft soap, dilute it with urine, scrub your trees with it plentifully,\r\nhaving first scraped off all rough bark. If you would work easily\r\nalways, never let your work drive you.\r\n\r\n4. WORK FOR APRIL.—Gather from your barn the loose hay seed, and sow\r\nit upon your wheat fields; it will give good pasturage, after harvest,\r\nand make fine stuff for plowing under. Push forward your plowing, but\r\nlook well to the teams; as cattle and horses are like men, unable in\r\nearly spring to endure severe labor all at once. Your spring wheat\r\nshould be got in; barley is a better crop, usually, than rye. The\r\nmiddle and last of the month will keep you in the corn-field. Plow\r\ndeep—plow thoroughly; and after planting, give the plow no rest, if\r\nyou wish good corn.\r\n\r\nYOUNG ANIMALS.—You will now begin to have plenty of calves, colts,\r\npigs, and lambs. If you mean to have profitable pork, you ought to\r\n_push_ your pigs from the birth. Look carefully after your lambs; see\r\nthat the mothers are well cared for; have dry and warm pens for any\r\nthat are feeble. A little tenderness to the lambs will be well repaid\r\nby and by.\r\n\r\nGARDEN.—Your lettuce may be transplanted from the hot-bed the middle\r\nand last of this month. A foot apart is none too much, if you wish\r\nhead-lettuce. Sow your main supplies of radishes, cabbage, tomatoes,\r\netc. Get your pie-plant seed in early as possible; also carrots,\r\nparsnips, and salsify or oyster-plant. Prune your gooseberries,\r\ncurrants, and raspberry bushes. Grapes, which were not laid in last\r\nfall should be pruned and laid in early in March; but if neglected\r\nthen, let them be till the leaves are large as the palm of your hand.\r\nLook out or worms’ nests, and destroy them promptly.\r\n\r\n5. WORK FOR MAY.—Your whole force will be required in this month. If\r\nthe season has been late or wet, you still have your corn to plant.\r\nPastures will be ready for your stock; remember to salt your stock\r\nevery week. Weeds will now do their best to take your crops. Your\r\npotato crop should be put in, as there will be little danger of frost.\r\nAfter the 15th, you may put out sweet potato slips. If you have not\r\ngrass-land for pasturage, try for one season the system of _soiling_,\r\n_i. e._ keeping up your cattle in the yard or home-lot, and cutting\r\ngreen-fodder for them every day. An acre or two of corn, sown\r\nbroad-cast, or oats and millet, should be tried. Above all other\r\nthings, if you have warm, deep sandy loam, put in an acre of lucerne.\r\n\r\nDuring the last of this month, and at the beginning of the next,\r\npruning may be done. If the limbs be large, cover the stump with a\r\ncoat of paint, wax, grafting clay, or anything that will exclude air\r\nand wet.\r\n\r\nThe garden will require extra labor in all this month. After the 15th,\r\ntender bulbs and tubers may be planted, dahlias, amaryllises,\r\ntuberoses, etc. Peas will require brush; all your plants from the\r\nhot-bed should by this time be well a growing in open air. Roses will\r\nbe showing their buds. If large roses of a favorite sort are required,\r\nmore than half the buds should be taken off, and the whole strength of\r\nthe plant be given to the remainder. The soil for this best of all\r\nflowers, cannot be too rich, nor too deep.\r\n\r\n6. WORK FOR JUNE—May, June, and September are the _dairy months_. The\r\nbest butter and the best cheese are usually made in these months. If\r\nyou are not neat, you do not know how to make cheese or butter.\r\nUncleanliness affects not only the looks, but the quality of butter.\r\nBroad, shallow glass pans are the best, but the most expensive. In\r\nthese milk seldom turns sour in summer thunder-storms. Tin pans are\r\ngood, but unless the dairy-woman is _scrupulously_ neat, the seams\r\nwill be filled with residuum of milk and become very foul, giving a\r\nflavor to each successive panful. The principal requisites for prime\r\nbutter are, good cows, good pasture for them, clean pans, cool, airy\r\ncellars, clean churns. Let the cream be churned before it is sour or\r\nbitter; and when the butter comes, at least three thorough workings\r\nwill be necessary to drive out all the butter-milk.\r\n\r\nGARDEN.—Transplant flowers; destroy all weeds; get out cabbages; more\r\nlettuce; get ready celery trenches; layer favorite roses, vines, etc.;\r\nexamine and remove from the peach-tree root, the grub which is\r\ndestroying them. Sow salt under plum-trees—put on a coat two inches\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nTransplant flowers; bud roses with fine kinds; see that large plants\r\nare tied neatly to frames or stakes. Every morning examine your beds\r\nof cabbage, etc., for cut-worms, and destroy them if found; plant\r\nsuccession crops of peas, corn, radishes, lettuce, etc.\r\n\r\n7. WORK FOR JULY.—Great difference of practice and opinion exists as\r\nto the methods and time of harvesting. Some cut their grass while the\r\ndew is on it; others cut it when perfectly dry, and say that if so cut\r\nit need not be spread, but will dry in the swath in one or two days.\r\nAs to the _time_ of cutting grass, we should avoid both extremes of\r\nvery early or very late. Just before the seed of _timothy_ is ripe,\r\nis, upon the whole, the best time for this best of grasses for the\r\nscythe. Clover should be cut when in full blossom; instead of\r\nspreading, the best farmers make it into small cocks and leave it\r\nthere to cure, which it will do without shrivelling or losing its\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK.—As soon as your roses are done blooming, if you wish to\r\nincrease them, take the young shoots, and about eight inches from the\r\nground, cut, below an eye, half through, and then slit upward an inch\r\nor two through the pith; put a bit of chip in to keep the slit open;\r\nbend down the branch and cover the portion thus operated on with an\r\ninch or two of earth and put a brick upon it. It will soon send out\r\nroots, and by October may be separated from the parent plant. Quinces,\r\ngooseberries, and almost all shrubs which branch near the ground, may\r\nbe propagated in this way. Still keep down weeds. Sow successive crops\r\nof corn, peas and salads, for fall use. Begin to gather such seeds as\r\nripen early. Take up tulips, hyacinths, etc., as soon as the tops\r\nwither.\r\n\r\n8. WORK FOR AUGUST.—If during this hot month you will clear out fence\r\ncorners, and cut off vexatious intruders, the sun will do all it can\r\nto help you kill them. If your wheat is troubled with the weevil,\r\nthrash it out and leave it in the chaff. It will raise a heat fatal to\r\nits enemy without injuring itself. Every farmer should have a little\r\nnursery row of apple, pear, peach and plums of his own raising. Plant\r\nthe seed; when a year old, transplant into rows eight inches apart in\r\nthe row and two feet between the rows. During July, August, and\r\nSeptember, you may bud them with choice sorts, remembering that a\r\n_first-rate_ fruit will live just as easily as a worthless sort. This\r\nis a good month to sow down fallow fields to grass. Plough\r\nthoroughly—harrow till the earth is fine; be liberal of seed, and\r\ncover in with a harrow and not with a bush, which drags the seeds into\r\nheaps, or carries them in hollows. The early part of the month should\r\nbe improved by all who wish to put in a crop of buck-wheat or turnips.\r\nIf your pastures are getting short, let your milch cows have something\r\nevery night in the yard. Corn, sown broadcast, would now render\r\nadmirable service.\r\n\r\nIf you have neglected to raise your bulbs, lose no time now. Take\r\ncuttings from roses and put in small pots, invert a glass over them;\r\nin two or three weeks they will take root, and by the next spring make\r\ngood plants. Gather flower seeds as soon as they ripen.\r\n\r\n9. WORK FOR SEPTEMBER.—You should finish seeding your wheat grounds in\r\nthis month. If sown too early, it is liable to suffer from the fly; if\r\ntoo late, from rust. Those who sow acres by the hundred, must sow\r\nearly and late both. But moderate fields should be seeded by the\r\nmiddle of this month. In preparing the land, if the surface does not\r\nnaturally drain itself, it should be so plowed as to turn the water\r\ninto furrows between each land. Standing water, and, yet more, ice\r\nupon it, being fatal to it. See that your cattle are brought into good\r\ncondition for wintering. Fall transplanting may be performed from the\r\nmiddle of this month; _take off every leaf_—re-set, and stake.\r\n\r\nBy the latter part of the month, or early in October, according to the\r\nseason, it will be necessary to raise and pot such plants as you\r\nintend to keep in the house; to raise and place in a dry and\r\nfrost-proof room your dahlias, tuberoses, amaryllis, tigridia,\r\ngladioli, and such other tender bulbs as you may have. Let your seed\r\nbe gathered, carefully put away where it will contract no moisture. Go\r\nover your grounds and examine all your _labels_, lest the storms which\r\nare approaching should destroy them. Sow in some warm and sheltered\r\npart of your garden, early in this month, for spring use, spinage,\r\ncorn salad, lettuce, etc. As soon as the leaves fall, take cuttings\r\nfrom currant bushes and grapes, and plant them out in rows. They will\r\nstart off and grow earlier by some six weeks, the next season. Fill in\r\nyour celery trenches every ten days.\r\n\r\n10. WORK FOR OCTOBER.—Push forward your hogs as fast as possible. If\r\nthey have had a good clover range in the summer, they will be ready to\r\nstart off vigorously from the moment that you begin to put them upon\r\ncorn. See that good paths are made in every direction from your house;\r\nand be sure to have walks through your barn-yards raised so high as\r\nnever to be muddy. Your cattle-yards should slope toward the centre in\r\nsuch a way that horses and cattle need not wade knee deep in going in\r\nand out.\r\n\r\nFrosts will now begin to strip your trees and stop the growth of\r\ngarden shrubs, and all your preparations should be made for protecting\r\ntender trees and shrubs. For cherry and pear-trees, especially, you\r\nshould provide good covering for their trunk, until they have grown\r\nquite large. A good bundle of corn-stalks set round the body so as to\r\nkeep out the sun, but not the air, will answer every purpose. For beds\r\nof China and tea, and dwarf roses, we advise a covering of three\r\ninches of half-rotted manure. Cover this with leaves about six inches.\r\nMoss is better, if you will take the trouble to collect it; and straw\r\nwill do if you have neither moss nor leaves. Half cover the part that\r\nremains exposed, with fine brush, or pine branches. For single plants,\r\ndrive a stake by their side, and tie the plant to it; wind loosely\r\nabout it a wisp of straw or roll of bass matting, or cloth, so as to\r\nexclude the sun and not the air. The _sun_, and not the _cold_,\r\nusually destroys plants.\r\n\r\n11. WORK FOR NOVEMBER.—During this month, if the ground is not locked\r\nby frost, you may plow stiff, tenacious clay soils to great advantage.\r\nBy being broken up and subjected to the keen frosts, your soil will\r\nbecome mellow and tender. See that every provision is made for\r\nsheltering your cattle and horses; be sure that your sheep are not\r\nobliged to lie out in drenching rains.\r\n\r\nIN THE GARDEN see that your asparagus bed is dressed if neglected last\r\nmonth. House all your brush, poles, stakes, frames, etc., which will\r\nbe fit for use another season. If your tulips, hyacinths, etc. have\r\nnot been planted, you had better reserve them for spring, as they will\r\nbe liable to rot in the ground if planted so late in the year. Cover\r\nwith brush, or leaves, or straw, your lettuce, spinage, and other\r\nsalad plants designed for spring use. If tender plants, roses, vines,\r\netc., have been left unprotected, cover as directed last month. If you\r\nhave no cold frame for half-hardy plants, they may be _laid in by the\r\nheels_, i. e., taken up, and the roots laid into a trench, the tops\r\nsloping at an angle of about twenty degrees, and then covered with\r\nearth. The soil should cover about half the stem.\r\n\r\nIt is now a good season for cutting grafts. Take them from the outside\r\nof the middle of the tree; let them be done up in small packages, and\r\nset up endwise in the cellar, and covered with about half-dry sand.\r\nRoots may be taken from pear and apple-trees, and packed in the same\r\nway for root-grafting.\r\n\r\n12. DECEMBER.—The year is about to close. Look back upon your toil. In\r\nwhat respect will your year’s labor bear an approval when calmly\r\nexamined? Can you honestly acquit yourself of indolence and\r\ncarelessness? and as honestly take credit for enterprise, activity,\r\nand a desire for improvement? Your barns are full—your granary is\r\nheavy with grain—the year’s bounty has followed a year’s labor, and if\r\nyou have the heart of a man you will not forget the source whence your\r\nblessings have come. You have perhaps done well by your stock, and in\r\nso far as the body is concerned, for your children; but what have you\r\ndone for their education? What have you done to promote popular\r\neducation? Are you doing anything to make your neighborhood better?\r\nWhat good newspapers do you provide for your family? Do you lay out as\r\nmuch money for books as you do for tobacco? In looking forward to the\r\nnext year, you ought to mark out your personal course by good\r\nresolutions, and your business course by a definite plan of\r\noperations. It would be well if a farmer should know beforehand\r\neverything he means to do; and afterwards, if he has kept such an\r\naccount that you can tell anything that you have done.\r\n\r\nSleighing for the young and gay, and warm fire-sides for the aged, are\r\nwhat are now most thought of. Those who are best provided with the\r\ncomforts of life should remember their less favored brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATED FARMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is time for those who do not believe ignorance to be a blessing, to\r\nmove in behalf of common schools. Many teachers are not practised even\r\nin the rudiments of the spelling-book; and as for reading, they\r\nstumble along the sentences, like a drunken man on a rough road. Their\r\n“_hand-write_,” as they felicitously style the hieroglyphics, would be\r\na match for Champollion, even if he _did_ decipher the Egyptian\r\ninscriptions. But a more detestable fact is, that sometimes their\r\nmorals are bad; they are intemperate, coarse, and ill-tempered; and\r\nwholly unfit to inspire the minds of the pupils with one generous or\r\npure sentiment. We do not mean to characterize the _body_ of the\r\ncommon schoolmasters by these remarks; but that any considerable\r\nportion of them should be such, is a disgraceful evidence of the low\r\nstate of education.\r\n\r\nFarmers and mechanics! this is a subject which comes home to you.\r\nCrafty politicians are constantly calling you the _bone and sinew_ of\r\nthe land; and you may depend upon it that you will never be anything\r\nelse but bone and sinew without education. There is a law of God in\r\nthis matter. That class of men who make the most and best use of their\r\n_heads_, will, in _fact_, be the most influential, will stand highest,\r\nwhatever the theories and speeches may say. This is a “nature of\r\nthings” which cannot be dodged, nor got over. Whatever class bestow\r\ngreat pains upon the cultivation of their minds will stand high. If\r\nfarmers and mechanics feel themselves to be as good as other people,\r\nit all may be true; for _goodness_ is one thing and _intelligence_ is\r\nanother. If they think that they have just as much mind as other\r\nclasses, that may be true; but can you _use it as well_?\r\n\r\nLawyers, and physicians, and clergymen, and literary men, make the\r\ndiscipline of their intellect a constant study. They read more, think\r\nmore, write more than the laboring classes. The difference between the\r\neducated and uneducated portions of society is a _real_ difference.\r\nNow a proud and lazy fellow, may rail and swear at this, and have his\r\nlabor for his pains. There is only one way really to get over it, and\r\nthat is to rear up a generation of well educated, thinking, reading\r\nfarmers and mechanics. Your skill and industry are felt; and they put\r\nyou, in these respects, ahead of any other class. Just as soon as your\r\n_heads_ are felt, as much as your _hands_ are, that will bring you to\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nMany of our best farmers are men of great natural shrewdness; but when\r\nthey were young they “had no chance for learning.” They feel the loss,\r\nand they are giving their children the best education they can.\r\nFarmers’ sons constitute three-fifths of the educated class. But the\r\nthing is, that they are not educated _as farmers_. When they begin to\r\nstudy they leave the farm. They do not expect to return to it. The\r\nidea of sending a boy to the school, the academy, and the college, and\r\nthen let him go back to farming, is regarded as a mere waste of time\r\nand money. You see how it is even among yourselves. If a boy has an\r\neducation, you expect him to be a lawyer, or a doctor, or a preacher.\r\nYou tacitly admit that a farmer does not need such an education; and\r\nif you think so, you cannot blame others if they follow your example.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why men of the very highest education should not go\r\nto a farm for their living. If a son of mine were brought up on\r\npurpose to be a farmer, if that was the calling which he preferred, I\r\nstill would educate him, if he had common sense to begin with. He\r\nwould be as much better for it as a farmer, as he would as a lawyer.\r\nThere is no reason why a thoroughly scientific education should not be\r\ngiven to every farmer and to every mechanic. A beginning must be made\r\nat the common school. Every neighborhood ought to have one. But they\r\ndo not grow of themselves, like toad-stools. And no decent man will\r\nteach school on wages which a canal boy, or a hostler would turn up\r\nhis nose at. You may as well put your money into the fire as to send\r\nit to a “make-believe” teacher—a great noodle-head, who teaches school\r\nbecause he is fit for nothing else! Lay out to get a _good teacher_.\r\nBe willing to pay enough to make it worth while for “smart” men to\r\nbecome your teachers. And when your boys show an awakening taste for\r\nbooks, see that they have good histories, travels, and scientific\r\ntracts and treatises. Above all, do not let a boy get a notion that if\r\nhe is educated, he must, of course, quit the farm. Let him get an\r\neducation that he may _make a better farmer_. I do not despair of yet\r\nseeing a generation of honest politicians. Educated farmers and\r\neducated mechanics, who are in good circumstances, and _do not need\r\noffice for a support_, nor make politics a trade, will stand the best\r\nchance for honesty. But the Lord deliver us from the political honesty\r\nof tenth-rate lawyers, vagabond doctors, bawling preachers, and\r\nbankrupt clerks, turned into patriotic politicians!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACRE OF WORDS ABOUT AKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur spelling _acre_ according to Webster’s former method[1]—_aker_,\r\nhas attracted no little attention, in a small way, both far and near.\r\nIt is very difficult to fix on any rule for anything in our language.\r\nEtymology is chiefly useful in settling the primitive signification,\r\nand is, or ought to be, scarcely at all authoritative in orthography.\r\nWhere two languages are very different, it is absurd to attempt the\r\nforms of the one in the other. In respect to _idiom_, no one dreams of\r\ntransferring it from one to another. Oftentimes it is equally absurd\r\nto transfer mere literation, as in the Greek-blooded word _Phthisic_\r\nfor Tisic, or as Walker would have spelled it, _Phthisick_! Who rebels\r\nbecause _demesne_, as it is written in our best authors until within a\r\nlittle time, is now spelled _domain_? We see no reason why Anglicized\r\nwords should, against all our notions of sound, retain a cumbrous\r\nforeign spelling. Words adopted into a language by the _ear_, which\r\nare spoken before they are written, generally conform, on being\r\nwritten, to our modes of spelling. But words introduced first by the\r\neye, as they are written, for a long time wear the original spelling.\r\nThus some foreign words are spelled by one method, and some by\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nCustom is usually regarded as determinate, in the matter of spelling,\r\npronunciation, idiom, purity, etc. But, in respect to spelling, custom\r\nis not long the same. If one will examine our literature from the time\r\nof Henry VIII., he will find a constant succession of changes in\r\nspelling, both for good and for bad. _I_ has been generally\r\nsubstituted for _Y_, as in _Lykwyse_, _accordynge_, _beyng_,\r\n_certayne_. Sir Thomas More wrote _hym_, _thynges_, _desyer_,\r\n_myndes_. Skelton, the Poet Laureat, has _centencyously_, _dyd_,\r\n_advysynge_, _hyll_, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThere has, too, and wisely, been a constant tendency to drop all\r\n_unsounded_ letters. What earthly use is there of lugging along\r\nletters which are entirely mute? In old but classic authors we have\r\nGod_de_ dyd_de_, now_e_, which_e_, pull_e_, best_e_, such_e_,\r\ncou_e_rt_e_ (court) be_e_twen_e_, begun_ne_, etc.\r\n\r\nWithin our own memory the final _k_ is lopped of from words where it\r\nhad a perfect sinecure, as in music_k_, etc. “_Kan’t kum it_,” does\r\nnot look any more odd to our eyes than our spelling would have looked\r\nto those who wrote one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why we do not spell every word by the same rule that we\r\ndo some; we reply, that violent, and sudden changes in languages are\r\n_impracticable_; and as in everything else, are not desirable. We are\r\nglad to see spelling simplified, and shall move along just as fast as\r\nwe can do it with a reasonable prospect of carrying the public.\r\n\r\nIt is not a matter of conscience; we have no necessity laid upon us to\r\nreform the language; no call to be _literal_ martyrs; it is a matter\r\nof _convenience_ and _taste_, to be done or omitted as one pleases. It\r\nwould be more inconvenient to stand alone with all writers against us,\r\nfor the sake of spelling consistently, than to spell foolishly and\r\nsuperfluously in conformity to inveterate practice. Therefore, for the\r\nsake of company, we still spell quite absurdly.\r\n\r\nIt is called _inconsistent_; and by men, too, who spell trough, cough,\r\nenough, though; through, bought, six dissimilar sounds (_ou_, _ow_,\r\n_oo_, _o_, _uf_, _off_), by the same combination of letters! If\r\nconsistency be the question, every English writer that ever lived, is\r\na mere bundle of inconsistencies. Every continental living language,\r\nand the dead classic languages, have thrown in their contributions,\r\nand our tongue comprises the scraps, odds and ends, of all lands, with\r\nall the diverse peculiarities of each language more or less retained.\r\nUnder such circumstances, when no man writes a sentence without\r\nspelling inconsistently, it is quite ridiculous to oppose a\r\nsimplification of spelling, because we cannot do, at once, what it is\r\nonly practicable to do gradually. As fast as the public is able to\r\nbear it, we shall be glad to reduce all cumbrous spelling to a\r\nconsistent simplicity.\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance declares, that the derivation of AKER from the Latin\r\nand Greek, is “without the least foundation in the words as used in\r\nthe Greek and Latin and in the English, and built entirely on the\r\nresemblance of sounds,” etc. The facts are the other way. In the\r\nGreek, and in the Latin, it meant simply a field, an open, cultivated\r\nspot. Now, this was the meaning of the word in English, until it was\r\nby statutes limited to a particular quantity (31 Ed. III.; 5 Ed. I.,\r\n24; Henry VIII., as quoted by Webster) and this is the meaning yet, of\r\nthe word in German (_acker_) Swedish (_acker_) Dutch (_akker_). There\r\nis, therefore, ample foundation in the _use_ of the word; and the\r\n_sound_ our friend gives up.\r\n\r\nIn almost all the languages of the Teutonic family, of which ours is\r\none, the word is still spelled with _k_; and so it is in the Asiatic\r\nlanguages, from which, probably, both the Teutonic and the Greek,\r\nalike borrowed it.\r\n\r\nThe spelling a_cre_, as also cent_re_, theat_re_ we, probably, derived\r\nfrom the French; to which language we owe the emasculation of many a\r\nnoble Saxon word.\r\n\r\nIn the _New England Farmer_ our orthographical sins are thus set in\r\norder before us:\r\n\r\n     “The _Western Farmer and Gardener_, is an excellent\r\n     journal—very. It has only one feature that we dislike,\r\n     viz.—it spells ACRE _a-k-e-r_! We are somewhat surprised at\r\n     Bro. Beecher, who usually evinces such good taste, as well\r\n     as such good sense, should adopt such an ugly-looking\r\n     substitute for an old word of so much better appearance,\r\n     although supported in it by the prince of lexicographers.\r\n\r\n     “_A-k-e-r!_ Wheugh! Bro. editors, _hoot_ at it till it shall\r\n     become obsolete. In Todd’s, Johnson’s, and Walker’s, and\r\n     Worcester’s dictionaries, _fuel_ is spelled _fewel_, as the\r\n     most correct way. This is odd enough and bad enough—but it\r\n     is hardly so unsightly as _aker_.”\r\n\r\nNothing becomes obsolete until it has been in vogue. But pass that:\r\nwhat a sight will the hooting confraternity present! I imagine Maine\r\nFarmer Holmes—a plump, short, dapper gentleman, giving a long howl,\r\nthat sounds so ludicrous, that he draws back from the open window to\r\nlaugh. Our more sober Breck performs the euphonious duty with such\r\nconscientious heartiness, that up starts the man of Buckwheat from his\r\n(mis-spelled) Plo_ugh_man’s chair, as also does the Cultivator Cole—a\r\ntrio not practiced to sing together. The uproar reaches Albany, and\r\nsurprises him of the Cultivator, who hoots supplementary, with such\r\nvoice as he happens, in his surprise, to have on hand. Next, toward\r\nthe west, Dr. Lee shall give a scientific roar or hoot such as will\r\nmake his laboratory jar again. Down across the lake the hooting (not\r\n_hunting_) chorus goes (what will the sailors think is to pay!) to\r\nElliot of the yard-long-named Magazine, who, hoarse with lake fogs and\r\nwinds, shall put in so bass a hoot, that Wight and Wright of the\r\n_Prairie Farmer_ will howl of mere fright, if for nothing else.\r\n\r\nAudacious men! we utterly defy you! We shall pass by the whole crowing\r\nbrood of Polands, Dorkings and what-not; and raise a breed of genuine\r\nowls, to be our champions in this dire necessity. We say,\r\nperemptorily, that we will not bet on any match between hooting birds\r\nand hooting editors. But our serious opinion is, that, in grave\r\nsolemnity of looks, and in professional hooting, a half dozen\r\nwell-trained owls will beat the whole of you. However, we are open to\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [1] Two-volume edition, imperial octavo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS’ LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of the highest importance that farmers should possess _reading\r\nhabits_; and that they should bring up their children to a love of\r\nbooks. Every farmer should have a library; it may, at first, be small;\r\nbut it should be select. As soon as a farmer is beforehand enough to\r\nown an acre, he is prosperous enough to begin a library. It is said by\r\nmany, _books won’t make money_. Yes they will. To-be-sure, their best\r\neffect is the production of intelligence in the reader; but a man well\r\ninformed in his own business is just the man to make money. Who ever\r\nthought of making money by buying grindstones and whetstones? But they\r\nsharpen the scythe, and sickle, and the axe, and _they_ produce money.\r\nBooks are grindstones and whetstones for a man’s mind.\r\n\r\nMany are unwilling to buy a treatise upon the disease of the horse,\r\nalthough there are several which will _prevent_ most of the evils\r\nwhich affect this noble animal. In the West, the horse is used, in\r\ntown and country, by almost every man. But very few profess to know\r\nhow he should be treated! And, of those who think they are wise, how\r\nmany have any knowledge except of a few nostrums for sickness? The\r\nhorse, in man’s service, is living in an entirely artificial state. He\r\ntakes care of himself if left wild. But living in stables, laboring\r\nevery month of the year in harness, and under the saddle, not\r\nselecting his own food, but fed at the will of his master, his own\r\ninstincts become of little use, and he is dependent entirely on the\r\nmercy and knowledge of those whose slave he is. It ought not to be\r\nthought unreasonable to say that every man who is willing to _own_ a\r\nhorse, ought to be willing to know how to _manage_ him, in the stable\r\nand out of it. There is no work in the English language containing\r\nmore, or better instructions than[2] Stewart’s Stable Economy. It\r\nshould be read by the farmer; and just as much by every man, of\r\nwhatever calling, who uses a horse, or owns one. It is of standard\r\nauthority in England. Mr. Stewart has long been a professor in\r\nveterinary institutes. Every man ought to know how to treat a sick\r\nhorse. Suppose a horse to be taken sick on a journey; most frequently\r\nthe driver is the only one at hand to prescribe. If you are at a\r\ntavern, of what use, generally speaking, are the bragging pretensions\r\nof those that crowd around you? Stopping for a night at a wretched\r\nhole of a tavern, one of my horses, at night fell sick. I knew no more\r\nthan a child what to do; the landlord (ah me! I shall never forget\r\nhim!) was equally ignorant and much more indifferent. A big, bragging,\r\nEnglish booby was the only one pretending to know what to do; and to\r\nhim I yielded the animal. After sundry manipulations—punching him in\r\nthe loins; pulling at his ears, etc.—he rolled up a wad of _hair from\r\nhis tail_, and crammed it down the horse’s throat! presuming, I\r\nsuppose, that the hair would find its way back to the place it came\r\nfrom, and so pilot the disease out! I inwardly resolved never to go\r\nanother journey until in possession of the best remedies for the\r\nattacks common to horses on the road.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPREPARING CUTTINGS IN THE FALL.—Cuttings of the currant, gooseberry,\r\nand grape are better if cut immediately on the fall of the leaf,\r\nplunged into moist sand two-thirds of their length, and placed in a\r\ncellar. If nature is as propitious to others as she has been to us,\r\nthe cuttings will be found in the spring with the granulations\r\ncompleted at the lower end, and the roots just ready to push; and on\r\nbeing planted out, they grow off immediately, forming during the\r\nseason well established plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [2] _A Treatise on the management of horses in relation to\r\n     stabling, grooming, feeding, watering, and working_:\r\n     published by A. O. Moore & Co., N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNINE MISTAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn so far as instruction is concerned, I esteem my mistakes to be more\r\nvaluable than my successful efforts. They excite to attention and\r\ninvestigation with great emphasis. I will record a few.\r\n\r\n1. One mistake, which I record once for all, as it will probably occur\r\nevery year, has been the attempting of more than I could do _well_.\r\nThe ardor of spring, in spite of experience, lays out a larger garden,\r\nthan can be well tended all summer.\r\n\r\n2. In selecting the _largest_ lima beans for seed, I obtained most\r\nluxuriant vines, but fewer pods. If the season were longer these vines\r\nwould ultimately be most profitable; but their vigor gives a growth\r\ntoo rampant for our latitude. If planted for a screen, however, the\r\nrankest growers are the best.\r\n\r\n3. Of three successive plantings of corn, for table use, the first was\r\nthe best, then the second, and the third very poor. I hoed and thinned\r\nthe first planting myself, and thoroughly; the second, I left to a\r\nDutchman, directing him how to do it; the third, I left to him without\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n4. I bought a stock of roses in the _fall of the year_. All the loss\r\nof wintering came on me. If purchased in the spring, the nurserymen\r\nloses, if there is loss.\r\n\r\n5. I planted the silver-leaved abele (_Populus alba_) in a rich sandy\r\nloam; in which it made more wood than it could ripen. The tree was\r\ntop-heavy, and required constant staking. A poorer soil should have\r\nbeen selected.\r\n\r\n6. I planted abundantly of flower-seeds—just before a drought. I\r\nneither covered the earth with mats, nor watered it—supposing that the\r\nseeds would come up after the first rain. But, in a cheerless and\r\nbarren garden, I have learned that _heat_ will kill planted seeds, and\r\nthat he who will be sure of flowers should not depend upon only one\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\n7. In the fall of 1843, I took up the bulbs of tuberoses, and wintered\r\nthem safely upon the top of book-cases in a warm study. Having a\r\nbetter and larger stock in 1844, I would fain be yet more careful, and\r\npacked them in dry sand, and put them in a closet beyond the reach of\r\nfrost. On opening them in the spring all were rotted save about half a\r\ndozen. Hereafter, I shall try the book-case.\r\n\r\n8. We are told that glazed or painted flower-pots are not desirable,\r\nbecause, refusing a passage to superfluous moisture, they leave the\r\nroots to become sodden. In small stove-heated parlors, the evaporation\r\nis so great that glazed or painted flower-pots are _best_, because the\r\ndanger is of dryness rather than dampness in _all plants growing in\r\nsandy loams or composts_.\r\n\r\n9. I have resolved every summer for three years, to cut pea-brush\r\nduring the winter and stack it in the shed; and every summer\r\nfollowing, not having kept the vow, I have lacked pea-brush, being too\r\nbusy to get it when it was needed, I have allowed the crop to suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany county societies were formed in 1836 and for some years\r\nflourished; few of them, we believe, exist now. We hope that the day\r\nhas come for them to revive; and, that the experience of the past may\r\nnot be lost, it is well to record the reasons why these county\r\nsocieties declined.\r\n\r\n1. Just after their birth, came on the fatal years of fictitious\r\nprosperity; when every man expected a railroad on one side of his farm\r\nand a canal on the other—and when everybody was about to be\r\nexceedingly rich; not by legitimate business; not by producing wealth;\r\nbut by the _rise of property_. Now the wealth of a farming community\r\nis always to arise from the products of the farm. Whatever withdraws\r\nattention from assiduous cultivation, or plants the hope of gain in\r\nother sources than in the herds, the dairy, the grain and the grass\r\nfield, will, eventually, insure disappointment and even poverty, as\r\nmany of our farmers can testify. It would be difficult for those who\r\nhad not seen it, to imagine the fervent, sanguine, exulting, state of\r\nmind with which the whole community, at the time we speak of, looked\r\nfor the wealth. Farms were to quadruple in value; pork was to be\r\ncashed at enormous prices; grain and grass, stock and fruit, were to\r\nswell the golden tide; and, for once, the world was to see great\r\nriches from little labor. Carelessness, waste, rashness, and\r\nincredible presumption were the result. Societies for the promotion of\r\na careful and patient cultivation of the soil could not long be\r\nthought worthy of attention in a community which expected to be rich\r\nby a dexterous bargain, by one lucky speculation, by town lots, and\r\nshares, and that mysterious hum-bug—the rise of property.\r\n\r\n2. Succeeding such days came the opposite extreme. Everybody was poor\r\nand expected to be poorer. There was no money and no market. Hogs were\r\nhardly salable, grain a drug, and all produce unavailable. Nothing was\r\nbrisk but debt and debt collecting. Men were discouraged. Said they,\r\n“if one can sell nothing, there is no use in raising anything; twenty\r\nbushels an acre is as good as forty, when one can’t sell or use it.”\r\nSchools languished, public spirit died, business was totally deranged,\r\nand agricultural societies became extinct with the downfall of other\r\nuseful institutions.\r\n\r\n3. There were some things in the management of the societies which\r\nembarrassed them independently of these other causes. There was too\r\nmuch talk and pretension—wind work; the offices were taken for the\r\nhonor—patient endurance of drudgery, which somebody must bear, was\r\n_shirked_ off. Men took little pains _between_ the meetings;\r\neverything was to be done at the time of meeting; and, of course, half\r\ndone. This led to dissatisfaction. The mistakes of carelessness were\r\nattributed to partiality or prejudice. Some dropped off; others\r\nrelaxed; and, when the excitement was gone, few cared to take the dull\r\nbut real and necessary business.\r\n\r\n4. Notwithstanding all these things, the county societies did a great\r\ndeal of good. A skillful farmer told me, that in the county, where he\r\nresided, there was hardly a considerable farmer who did not try a few\r\nacres, at least, to see what he _could do_; and even many renters\r\nexhibited specimens of fine cultivation. More attention was paid to\r\nevery part of the farm; and, for a time, everything felt the impulse.\r\n\r\nA few words to those who may embark again in this good cause.\r\n\r\n1. It is best to begin as you can hold out. A great meeting, a vast\r\nroll of by-laws, a regiment of officers, a parade of speeches, these\r\nmake a fine meeting, and that’s all. Let a few stanch friends to\r\nimprovement put their heads and hands together, without show or noise;\r\nbegin at the little end, and hold fast what is gained.\r\n\r\n2. In choosing officers, societies almost invariably steer upon one\r\nrock on which thousands have split. There is a desire to put great men\r\ninto offices, to get their influence. In a mere public meeting of a\r\nday, this is well enough; but in a society which is to exist by\r\nefficient labor, it is suicide. Such men like to be puffed and\r\npublished as presidents, chairmen, etc., etc., but that ends the\r\nmatter. They go away and are not seen again till the next annual\r\nmeeting, when, lo! a resurrection takes place; and they flame again, a\r\nwhole year’s zeal exhibited in one day. It is best to select officers,\r\nwho are well broken, of a good strain of blood, and who pull steadily,\r\non hard ground, in the mud, over bridging, or upon turnpikes. In this\r\nway we may not have quite so large a show, but we shall have a\r\nsteadily growing and efficient society.\r\n\r\n3. In the award of premiums, more or less of dissatisfaction will\r\nalways be felt. A man who has worked a whole year for a premium cannot\r\nbe expected to lose it without some pain. Premiums should be awarded\r\nwith great care, with scrupulous impartiality, and every effort made\r\nby the leading, substantial farmers to soothe and keep down everything\r\nlike bitterness and faction, in consequence of disappointment.\r\n\r\n4. It is _indispensable_ that agricultural papers should go hand in\r\nhand with agricultural societies. We will venture to say, that no\r\nsociety will long exist prosperously, which does not have a reading\r\nmembership; and that a society can hardly fail to prosper if its\r\nmembers are regular readers of agricultural papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIFTLESS TRICKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo let the cattle fodder themselves at the stack; they pull out and\r\ntrample more than they eat. They eat till the edge of appetite is\r\ngone, and then daintily pick the choice parts; the residue, being\r\ncoarse and refuse, they will not afterwards touch.\r\n\r\nTo sell half a stack of hay and leave the lower half open to rain and\r\nsnow. In feeding out, a hay knife should be used on the stack; in\r\nselling, either dispose of the whole, or remove that which is left to\r\na shed or barn.\r\n\r\nIt is a shiftless trick to lie about stores and groceries, arguing\r\nwith men that you have _no time_, in a new country, for nice\r\nfarming—for making good fences; for smooth meadows without a stump;\r\nfor draining wet patches which disfigure fine fields.\r\n\r\nTo raise your own frogs in your own yard; to permit, year after year,\r\na dirty, stinking, mantled puddle to stand before your fence in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nTo plant orchards, and allow your cattle to eat the trees up. When\r\ngnawed down, to save your money, by trying to nurse the stubs into\r\ngood trees, instead of getting fresh ones from the nursery.\r\n\r\nTo allow an orchard to have blank spaces, where trees have died, and\r\nwhen the living trees begin to bear, to wake up and put young whips in\r\nthe vacant spots.\r\n\r\nIt is very shiftless to build your barnyard so that every rain shall\r\n_drain_ it; to build your privy and dig your well close together; to\r\nbuild a privy of more than seven feet square—some shiftless folks have\r\nit of the size of the whole yard; to set it in the most exposed spot\r\non the premises; to set it at the very far end of the garden, for the\r\npleasure of traversing mud-puddles and labyrinths of wet weeds in\r\nrainy days.\r\n\r\nIt is a dirty trick to make bread without washing one’s hands after\r\ncleaning fish or chickens; to use an apron for a handkerchief; to use\r\na veteran handkerchief just from the wars for an apron; to use\r\nmilk-pans alternately for washbowls and milk. To wash dishes and baby\r\nlinen in the same tub, either alternately or altogether; to chew snuff\r\nwhile you are cooking, for sometimes food will chance to be too highly\r\nspiced. We have a distinct but unutterable remembrance of a cud of\r\ntobacco in a dish of _hashed pork_—but it was before we were married!\r\n\r\nA lady of our acquaintance, at a boarding-house, excited some fears\r\namong her friends, by foaming at the mouth, of madness. In eating a\r\nhash (made, doubtless, of every scrap from the table, not consumed the\r\nday before), she found herself blessed with a mouthful of _hard soap_,\r\nwhich only lathered the more, the more she washed at it. It is a\r\nfilthy thing to comb one’s hair in a small kitchen in the intervals of\r\ncooking the breakfast; to use the bread trough for a cradle—a thing\r\nwhich we have undoubtedly seen; to put trunks, boxes, baskets, with\r\nsundry other utensils, under the bed where you keep the cake for\r\ncompany; we have seen a dexterous housewife whip the bed-spread aside,\r\nand bring forth, not what we feared, but a loaf-cake!\r\n\r\nIt is a dirty trick to wash children’s eyes in the pudding dish; not\r\nthat the sore eyes, but subsequent puddings, will not be benefited; to\r\nwipe dishes and spoons on a hand-towel; to wrap warm bread in a dirty\r\ntable-cloth; to make and mold bread on a table innocent of washing for\r\nweeks; to use dirty table-clothes for _sheets_, a practice of which we\r\nhave had experimental knowledge, once at least in our lives.\r\n\r\nThe standing plea of all slatterns and slovens is, that “everybody\r\nmust eat a peck of dirt before they die.” A peck? that would be a\r\nmercy, a mere mouthful, in comparison of cooked cart-loads of dirt\r\nwhich is to be eaten in steamboats, canal-boats, taverns, mansions,\r\nhuts and hovels.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO TRICKS.—It is a filthy trick to use it at all; and it puts an\r\nend to all our affected squeamishness at the Chinese taste, in eating\r\nrats, cats, and bird’s nests. It is a filthy trick to let the\r\nexquisite juice of tobacco trickle down the corners of one’s mouth; or\r\nlie in splashes on one’s coat, or bosom; to squirt the juice all over\r\na clean floor, or upon a carpet, or baptismally to sprinkle a proud\r\npair of andirons the refulgent glory of the much-scouring housewife.\r\nIt is a vile economy to lay up for re-mastication a half-chewed cud;\r\nto pocket a half-smoked cigar; and finally to be-drench one’s self\r\nwith tobacco juice, to so be-smoke one’s clothes that a man can be\r\nscented as far off as a whale-ship can be smelt at sea.\r\n\r\nIt is a shiftless trick to snuff a candle with your fingers, or your\r\nwife’s best scissors, to throw the snuff on the carpet, or on the\r\npolished floor, and then to extinguish it by treading on it!\r\n\r\nTo borrow a choice book; to read it with unwashed hands, that have\r\nbeen used in the charcoal bin, and finally to return it daubed on\r\nevery leaf with nose-blood spots, tobacco spatter, and dirty\r\nfinger-marks—this is a vile trick!\r\n\r\nIt is not altogether cleanly to use one’s knife to scrape boots, to\r\ncut harness, to skin cats, to cut tobacco, and then to cut apples\r\nwhich other people are to eat.\r\n\r\nIt is an unthrifty trick to bring in eggs from the barn in one’s coat\r\npocket, and then to sit down on them.\r\n\r\nIt is a filthy trick to borrow of or lend for others’ use, a\r\ntooth-brush, or a tooth-pick; to pick one’s teeth at table with a\r\nfork, or a jack-knife; to put your hat upon the dinner table among\r\nthe dishes; to spit generously into the fire, or at it, while the\r\nhearth is covered with food set to warm; for sometimes a man hits what\r\nhe don’t aim at.\r\n\r\nIt is an unmannerly trick to neglect the scraper outside the door, but\r\nto be scrupulous in cleaning your feet after you get inside, on the\r\ncarpet, rug, or andirons; to bring your drenched umbrella into the\r\nentry, where a black puddle may leave to the housewife melancholy\r\nevidence that you have been there.\r\n\r\nIt is soul-trying for a neat dairywoman to see her “man” watering the\r\nhorse out of her milk-bucket; or filtering horse-medicine through her\r\nmilk-strainer; or feeding his hogs with her water-pail; or, after\r\nbarn-work, to set the well-bucket outside the curb and wash his hands\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRO-CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few years ago, all the world was agog about electricity applied to\r\nvegetation. Sanguine persons grew red in the face with excitement, and\r\nenterprising schemers hoped to supersede all past processes of culture\r\nby this magical fluid. Things were to be made to grow not only as fast\r\nas lightning but _by_ lightning. Those mischievous bolts which had\r\nplayed their dangerous pranks with chimneys, oaks, and towers, were to\r\nbe regularly harnessed and set to work in the field like horses or\r\noxen. Many of our readers will recollect how widely the agricultural\r\npapers copied the glowing accounts brought from over the seas; and\r\nnobody was afraid of anything except of not believing enough.\r\n\r\nWell, the lightning has been too smart for them; and the whole pack\r\nwhich opened loud on the scent, are now heard just as loud on the back\r\ntrack. It usually takes two foolings to satisfy the public. They first\r\nswing to an extreme folly of injudicious admiration, and them vibrate\r\nto the opposite extreme of disgust. Everybody was fever-hot with morus\r\nmulticaulis; and then they went into chills about it. Durham stock\r\nbrought almost their weight in silver at one time, and then could\r\nhardly be sold at butchers’ prices. Berkshire hogs were all the rage,\r\nand now are in great and unmerited contempt. The guano fever sent\r\nhundreds of ships a-dung-hunting all over the earth: and lucky were\r\nthey who espied a precious heap of excrement. How little did the\r\npenguins and sea gulls of the Pacific imagine, that their unconscious\r\nobservance of the laws of nature was one day to figure so largely on\r\nthe British Exchange, and to raise such a bustle in chemical\r\nlaboratories!\r\n\r\nWe believed but few of these accounts of electricity, because we\r\nperceived nothing which could be regarded as settled. And now, we are\r\nfar from sympathizing with the recantations and apostasies from the\r\nelectric faith. Like all other things driven to extremes, we shall by\r\nand by see it settle upon a middle point.\r\n\r\nEditors are not without blame for these actions and reactions. Many of\r\nour best agricultural papers are connected with agricultural\r\nwarehouses which deal largely in all articles for which there is an\r\nagricultural demand. Without the slightest intention of deception,\r\nnay, with a desire to act cautiously, such pecuniary interest may\r\nsensibly affect the judgment of sanguine editors. But the wish to\r\nissue a spicy paper, full of life and surprise, inclines an editor to\r\npublish whatever is new, without a scrutiny of its truth. With a few\r\nhonorable exceptions of standard periodicals, we scarcely take an\r\nagricultural paper which does not contain most absurd stories gravely\r\nindited without a word of comment. Now, it seems to us that\r\nagricultural papers ought not to be the common sewers of news, full of\r\nwaste and refuse matter; but registers of rigid facts and scientific\r\nexpositors of the principles deducible from facts. Farmers are at\r\nfault also in the matter. An editor who depends for his support upon\r\nthe proceeds of his paper, must be a man of rare independence if he\r\ncan shield himself from the selfish influence of those who are his\r\nbest supporters. Men that have a novelty, a new and precious jewel of\r\na flower, a heavy stock of nursery commodities, or large herds of\r\nfancy stock, sheep or swine, can afford to circulate widely and praise\r\nany paper that will circulate widely and praise their special\r\ninterest. A sanguine editor inditing a eulogistic article, with a\r\nred-hot speculator whispering at each ear, will be very likely to lead\r\nmany simple farmers astray. Such articles, copied by newspapers,\r\nspread the infection beyond the circle of subscribers. Farmers that\r\ntake, and farmers that do not take the paper will be deceived.\r\n\r\nNow, let husbandmen give to their agricultural papers such a support\r\nas shall leave the editors free from temptations to listen to\r\ninterested persons; let them contribute so freely of their\r\nobservations that editors will not have to draw upon their imagination\r\nfor facts, and the agricultural press will become sober, stable,\r\naccurate, and so, profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGLE-CROP FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is extensively the practice of large farmers, to put their whole\r\nforce upon one staple article; a style of farming as full of risk, as\r\nit would be to invest a whole fortune in one kind of property. At the\r\nSouth, we have cotton plantations; nothing but cotton is raised. If\r\nthe market and the season happen to be propitious, enormous profits\r\nare made. If markets, or the planting or picking season are adverse,\r\nthe year is lost; for it was staked on one article; all the risks of\r\nthe year, instead of being distributed, were concentrated. Another\r\nplantation cultivates sugar exclusively; and the ambitious planter has\r\nhis pockets full or empty, according to chances which he cannot\r\nforesee, calculate, or overrule.\r\n\r\nAt the North, some farmers put in nothing but wheat; others, nothing\r\nbut corn. One relies on the hay crop; another makes or loses a year’s\r\nprofits on cattle. In each case, if the staple raised happens to\r\n_hit_, in every respect profits roll in like a flood. But such\r\noperations leave no margin for those casualties, and annual changes,\r\nwhich are inevitable.\r\n\r\nIreland, relying upon the potato as a support for a large mass of its\r\npoverty-stricken people, is visited with famine if this crop is\r\nshaken. The failure of the grain crop, in England, strikes panic into\r\nthe whole nation.\r\n\r\nA perfect system of agriculture should have in itself, a balancing\r\npower. There should be such a distribution of crops that a farmer may\r\nhave four or five chances instead of one. To be sure, a farmer cannot\r\ndrive so large a business—cut such a swath—where five small or\r\nmoderate operations take the place of a single great one. Five years\r\nof moderate profits are better than one gaining year and four years to\r\neat it up. A farmer has 160 acres—sixty are in wood: of the one\r\nhundred cleared acres, say _twenty_ are used for home lots, pasture,\r\ncorn, etc., and _eighty_ are in wheat. The fall may be bad for\r\nplanting, the spring may be bad, the fly may take the crop or the rust\r\nmay strike it; escaping all these, the weevil may damage it; and,\r\nafter all this, it may not bring a justifying price when got to\r\nmarket. Is it wise for a man to put his yearly support or gains upon\r\none crop and that one crop depending upon six or seven contingencies?\r\nIf there is a large crop _and_ high prices, he makes largely. Eighty\r\nacres at thirty bushels the acre yields 2,400 bushels, worth, say,\r\nseventy cents, or $1,680 gross receipts. Elated beyond measure, the\r\nlucky fellow buys some forty acres more of cleared land, reduces his\r\npasture, shaves of a portion from his meadow, plants a few acres only\r\nof corn, and puts every inch he can command into wheat; a good\r\noperation if he can find guaranty for as good seasons and as good\r\nmarket as before. But there are at least ten chances against for one\r\nin favor.\r\n\r\nA farm which depends for its profit on butter, cheese, fruit, timber,\r\ncattle, hogs, corn, wheat, potatoes, flax, etc., makes, perhaps, but a\r\nlittle on each crop; but the rains that come in _drops_ are useful,\r\nwhile those that come in _torrents_ and raise freshets, leave great\r\nmischief behind.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTICKS ON SHEEP.—A clergyman, who was early in life a regular-built\r\nshepherd, after the old-fashioned style, living with his flock,\r\nrequests us to call the attention of all interested in sheep, to the\r\nprevention of ticks adopted “in the place he came from.” A trough,\r\nlarge enough to hold a sheep, was filled with a decoction of tobacco;\r\nas soon as the sheep are sheared, they are plunged all over in, except\r\nthe nose and mouth (these organs being sacred to chewers and\r\nsnuffers). The lambs are treated in the same way, and a world of\r\ntrouble to the owner and yet more to the flock, is saved by this\r\nnauseous bath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED BREEDS OF HOGS AND CATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo farmer ever owns a fine animal without being proud of it. Yet, the\r\nsame man will have an inveterate prejudice against what are called\r\nimproved breeds. The “fancy” prices which have been extravagantly\r\npaid, the miserable failure which some have made in attempting to\r\nstock their farm with foreign breeds, together with a suspicion of\r\nwhatever is new, and a lack of enterprise, have deterred many farmers\r\nfrom seeking a better stock than the common run. It is in this way\r\nthat speculators, besides ruining themselves, which is of no great\r\nconsequence, seriously retard the progress of enlightened husbandry.\r\n\r\nLet us take a plain and practical view of the matter.\r\n\r\n1. Every man who has had anything to do with cattle, horses and swine,\r\nknows very well what a difference there is between different animals,\r\nin respect to size, form, and aptitude to fatten. Among twenty steers\r\nthere will be a few that without any reason that the owner can see,\r\nout-grow and out-fatten all the rest. A lot of fifty hogs gathered up\r\nfrom one neighborhood, will naturally divide itself into three sorts,\r\nthose which fatten with remarkable rapidity and on little food; those\r\nthat eat voraciously without taking on fat; and those that lie between\r\nthese two extremes and are not remarkable in one way or the other.\r\nEvery man that buys a horse knows that some horses require as much\r\nagain food as others to keep them fat.\r\n\r\n2. It is equally true that these qualities can be transmitted, by\r\ncareful breeding, from parent to offspring; until the qualities become\r\n_fixed_ in the breed. A particular _strain of blood_, is then said to\r\nbe established. By this process, English breeders of stock, with the\r\ngreatest perseverance and with admirable skill, have established\r\nseveral truly improved breeds. It is not mere beauty of form that has\r\nbeen gained, although this has been eminently attained; but also all\r\nthose qualities which make an ox valuable for the _yoke_ or for the\r\n_knife_; all that makes a cow good at the pail and afterwards for the\r\nbutcher; all that makes a hog valuable in flesh and fat. It is a\r\nmistake to suppose that the improved breeds have been formed to please\r\ngentlemen farmers and amateur fanciers. They have been perfected with\r\nan eye mainly to their _profitableness_ to the farmer—the real farmer.\r\nNor are they the stock for large farmers and rich proprietors alone.\r\nThey are more peculiarly suited to farmers of small or moderate means\r\nthan to any other; a rich farmer can afford to keep poor stock, if\r\nanybody can; but a small farmer is badly off indeed if the little that\r\nhe has is poor.\r\n\r\n3. No class of farmers are more interested in having good stock of all\r\nkinds than western farmers. Pork and beef constitute, probably,\r\nthree-fifths of their exports. It is of the last importance that they\r\nshould possess animals from which can be made the utmost profit. It is\r\nas much more profitable for an Indiana farmer to drive the very best\r\ncattle, as it is for a Massachusetts farmer. If improved breeds are\r\nfound on the Mohawk to be vastly more profitable than common stock,\r\nthey will be found to be just the same on the Wabash.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, either, because we have more corn than we can\r\nfeed, or more grass and hay than can be used, that we can make up for\r\ninferior quality by the greater quantity of cattle kept. A western\r\nfarmer may winter a hundred head of cattle without positive loss, when\r\na New York farmer would sink money by it. But that is not the\r\nquestion. Suppose two herds, of a hundred each, of four year olds,\r\npreparing for the shambles. They eat the same amount of grain, and hay\r\nor grass. But when weighing-time comes, one herd averages a fourth\r\nheavier than the other, and this is clear profit. With no more food,\r\nand no more labor, and no longer time in fattening, they yield the\r\nowner a fourth more profit.\r\n\r\nThree men start a hundred hogs apiece for market.\r\n\r\nThe first lot is of the true land-shark breed, and will average, say\r\none hundred and twenty-five pounds; the second lot are of a better\r\nbreed, and will average two hundred pounds; the third hundred are of a\r\nchoice breed and average three hundred pounds. If the market happen to\r\nbe heavy, the first lot can hardly be sold; the second lot sells\r\nmoderately well, the third lot goes promptly and at a shade higher\r\nprice. Now what is the difference of profit? If pork is selling for\r\ntwo dollars the hundred, the first hundred hogs bring two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars. The second, four hundred dollars; and the third, six\r\nhundred dollars. That is, a difference of breeds makes a difference in\r\nprofit, feeding and labor being the same in both cases, between the\r\nfirst and last lot, of three hundred and fifty dollars. But it will be\r\nmore than this, for hogs averaging three hundred pounds will command\r\ntwenty-five cents in the hundred more than those weighing a hundred\r\nand twenty-five pounds. The price which a farmer will get, then, for\r\nhis hundred acres of corn, depends upon what his hogs can do for him.\r\nOne sort of hogs can make up a fourth more fat than others, and\r\nanother can make up still a fourth more than these. If you owned a\r\nmill, which of two millers would you choose—the one who could make\r\nforty pounds of flour to the bushel, or the one who could make\r\nforty-five—the quality being equally good? Of two acres of land, which\r\nwould you choose—the one which would yield fifteen bushels of wheat,\r\nor the one which, with the same cultivation, would yield thirty? Our\r\nfarmers are willing enough to hunt for good lands; but why, on the\r\nsame reasons, should they not hunt for the best breeds of cows, cattle\r\nhogs, and horses?\r\n\r\n4. As to the different varieties which are cried up, we have no\r\ninterest in urging one more than another upon the public. It is all\r\none to us whether Hereford, Devon, or Durham, prevail; Woburn, Byfield\r\nor Berkshire. All that we ask is that farmers should aim to procure\r\n_the best_. Their own experience must determine which that is. One\r\nkind will suit one range of land better than another. Beginning with\r\nmoderation, a shrewd farmer will soon be able to tell whether any\r\nparticular breed will suit his farm.\r\n\r\nWe presume that all farmers work for the sake of profit: we urge an\r\nimprovement of stock simply on the ground of its _profitableness_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSORBENT QUALITIES OF FLOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that flour gains in weight on being made up\r\ninto bread. The English act of Parliament allowed 280 lbs. (a sack) of\r\nflour to make 320 lbs. of bread. But in fact it makes a much greater\r\nweight than this. The average per cent. of water, in English flour,\r\nnaturally, according to Johnson, is 15 per cent. But good English and\r\nFrench wheat bread, according to the same author, contains 44 per\r\ncent. of water; i. e. twenty-eight pounds are absorbed in making. By\r\nthis estimate, 280 lbs. would gain nearly _seventy four pounds_, while\r\nthe act of Parliament allows only _forty pounds_.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that American wheat absorbs more water than English;\r\nand that United States southern wheat, absorbs more than northern. It\r\nis also true that good wheat gains more in baking than poor wheat, and\r\nold flour, more than new. It is not good _because_ it takes up water;\r\nbut good flour has that property, and poor has not; and absorption is,\r\ntherefore, an evidence of quality.\r\n\r\nThis absorption of water is in part mechanical and in part chemical.\r\nThe difference between these may be illustrated; a bushel measure of\r\nshelled corn will admit a great quantity of water into its open\r\nspaces; it stands _between_ the kernels. When water is thrown upon\r\nlime, it does not exist _between_ the particles, but _combines_ with\r\nthem. Flour absorbs water in both ways.\r\n\r\nAbsorption, mechanically, depends upon the coarseness of flour, either\r\nfrom the character of its growth, or from the manner of its grinding.\r\nThe want of light and heat, in unfavorable climates, or in bad\r\nseasons, induces sluggish and imperfect action. The juices are but\r\npartially digested and assimilated. Many vegetable constituents exist,\r\nin consequence, in smaller quantities, or in a crude state. In such\r\ncases the texture is porous and spongy. Grinding breaks down the\r\norganized form without altering the essential nature of the texture.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, if this be true, that grain ripened under unfavorable\r\ninfluences would absorb _less_ rather than _more_ water, since the\r\nwatery particles, from the want of rapid digestion and excretion,\r\nremain in the grain. But after grain is cut, and put to dry, a literal\r\nevaporation takes place; the water is, in a measure, exhaled.\r\n\r\nWe are not to suppose that a mechanical absorption predominates. By\r\nfar the greatest proportion of water is supposed to _combine_ with the\r\ningredients of the flour—starch, gluten, etc.,—chemically. And as\r\nflour is rich in starch and gluten, it will have the power of taking\r\nwater into combination. It has been supposed that the absorbing power\r\nof flour depended mainly upon its gluten. But Johnson holds the\r\nposition in doubt. Whereas, Webster (of England) states that it is\r\nwith the starch, principally, that water combines. The per cent. of\r\nstarch, sugar, and gluten, etc., in wheat, depends on the soil and\r\nclimate;—on the soil, because it must derive from it, originally, the\r\nelements of its existence; on climate, because these elements require\r\na certain temperature and quantity of light for their perfect\r\nelaboration. It is on this account, that the wheat of southern Europe\r\nis better than that of England; that that of Egypt is superior to the\r\nItalian. In each case there is a superiority of climate which produces\r\nthe most perfect elaboration of all the elements of wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF AN ANTI-BOOK-FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever our anti-book-farmers can show us better crops at a less\r\nexpense, better flocks, and better farms, and better owners on them,\r\nthan book-farmers can, we shall become converts to their doctrines.\r\nBut, as yet, we cannot see how _intelligence_ in a farmer, should\r\ninjure his crops. Nor what difference it makes whether a farmer gets\r\nhis ideas from a sheet of paper, or from a neighbor’s mouth, or from\r\nhis own experience, so that he only gets good, practical, sound ideas.\r\nA farmer never objects to receive _political_ information from\r\nnewspapers; he is quite willing to learn the state of markets from\r\nnewspapers, and as willing to gain religious notions from reading, and\r\nhistorical knowledge, and all sorts of information except that which\r\nrelates to his business. He will go over and hear a neighbor tell how\r\nhe prepares his wheat-lands, how he selects and puts in his seed, how\r\nhe deals with his grounds in spring, in harvest and after\r\nharvest-time; but if that neighbor should write it all down carefully\r\nand put it into paper, it’s all poison! it’s _book-farming_!\r\n\r\n   “Strange such a difference there should be\r\n   ’Twixt tweedledum, and tweedledee.”\r\n\r\nIf I raise a head of lettuce surpassing all that has been seen\r\nhereabouts, every good farmer that loves a salad would send for a\r\nlittle seed, and ask, as he took it, “How do you contrive to raise\r\nsuch monstrous heads? you must have some secret about it.” But if my\r\nway were written down and printed, he would not touch it. “Poh, it’s\r\nbookish!”\r\n\r\nNow let us inquire in what States land is the best managed, yields the\r\nmost with the least cost, where are the best sheep, the best cattle,\r\nthe best hogs, the best wheat? It will be found to be in those\r\nStates having the most agricultural societies and the most\r\nwidely-disseminated agricultural papers.\r\n\r\nWhat is there in agriculture that requires a man to be ignorant if he\r\nwill be skillful? Or why may every other class of men learn by reading\r\nexcept the farmer? Mechanics have their journals; commercial men have\r\ntheir papers; religious men, theirs; politicians, theirs; there are\r\nmagazines and journals for the arts, for science, for education, and\r\n_why not for that grand pursuit on which all these stand_? We really\r\ncould never understand why farmers should not wish to have their\r\nvocation on a level with others; why they should feel proud to have\r\n_no_ paper, while every other pursuit is fond of _having_ one.\r\n\r\nThose who are prejudiced against book-farming are either good farmers,\r\nmisinformed of the design of agricultural papers, or poor farmers who\r\nonly treat this subject as they do all others, with blundering\r\nignorance. First, the good farmers; there are in every county many\r\nindustrious, hard-working men, who know that they cannot afford to\r\nrisk anything upon wild experiments. They have a growing family to\r\nsupport, taxes to pay, lands perhaps on which purchase money is due,\r\nor they are straining every nerve to make their crops build a barn,\r\nthat the barn may hold their crops. They suppose an agricultural paper\r\nto be stuffed full of wild fancies, expensive experiments, big stories\r\nmade up by men who know of no farming except parlor-farming. They\r\nwould, doubtless, be surprised to learn that ninety-nine parts in a\r\nhundred of the contents of agricultural papers are written by\r\n_hard-working practical farmers_! that the editor’s business is not to\r\nfoist absurd stories upon credulous readers, but to sift stories, to\r\nscrutinize accounts, to obtain whatever has been abundantly proved to\r\nbe fact, and to reject all that is suspected to be mere fanciful\r\ntheory. Such papers are designed to prevent imposition; to kill off\r\npretenders by exposing them; to search out from practical men whatever\r\nthey have found out, and to publish it for the benefit of their\r\nbrethren all over the Union; to spread before the laboring classes\r\nsuch sound, well-approved scientific knowledge as shall throw light\r\nupon every operation of the farm, the orchard and the garden.\r\n\r\nThe other class who rail at book-farming ought to be excused, for they\r\ndo not treat book-farming any worse than they do their own farming;\r\nindeed, not half so bad. They rate the paper with their tongue; but\r\ncruelly abuse their ground, for twelve months in the year with both\r\nhands. I will draw the portrait of a genuine anti-book-farmer of this\r\nlast sort.\r\n\r\nHe plows three inches deep lest he should turn up the poison that, in\r\nhis estimation, lies below; his wheat-land is plowed so as to keep as\r\nmuch water on it as possible; he sows two bushels to the acre and\r\nreaps ten, so that it takes a fifth of his crop to seed his ground;\r\nhis corn-land has never any help from him, but bears just what it\r\npleases, which is from thirty to thirty-five bushels by measurement,\r\nthough he brags that it is fifty or sixty. His hogs, if not remarkable\r\nfor fattening qualities, would beat old Eclipse at a quarter-race; and\r\nwere the man not prejudiced against deep plowing, his hogs would work\r\nhis grounds better with their prodigious snouts than he does with his\r\njack-knife-plow. His meadow-lands yield him from three-quarters of a\r\nton to a whole ton of hay, which is regularly spoiled in curing,\r\nregularly left out for a month, very irregularly stacked up, and left\r\nfor the cattle to pull out at their pleasure, and half-eat and\r\nhalf-trample underfoot. His horses would excite the avarice of an\r\nanatomist in search of osteological specimens, and returning from\r\ntheir range of pasture they are walking herbariums, bearing specimens\r\nin their mane and tail of every weed that bears a bur or cockle. But\r\noh, the cows! If held up in a bright day to the sun, don’t you think\r\nthey would be semi-transparent? But he tells us that good milkers are\r\nalways poor! His cows get what Providence sends them, and very little\r\nbeside, except in winter, then they have a half-peck of corn on ears a\r\nfoot long thrown to them, and they afford lively spectacles of\r\nanimated corn and cob-crushers—never mind, they yield, on an average,\r\nthree quarts of milk a-day! and that milk yields varieties of butter\r\nquite astonishing.\r\n\r\nHis farm never grows any better, in many respects it gets annually\r\nworse. After ten years’ work on a good soil, while his neighbors have\r\ngrown rich, he is just where he started, only his house is dirtier,\r\nhis fences more tottering, his soil poorer, his pride and his\r\nignorance greater. And when, at last, he sells out to a Pennsylvanian\r\nthat reads the Farmers’ Cabinet, or to some New Yorker with his\r\nCultivator packed up carefully as if it were gold, or to a Yankee with\r\nhis New England Farmer, he goes off to Missouri, thanking Heaven that\r\n_he’s_ not a book-farmer!\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, there are two sides to this question, and both of them\r\n_extremes_, and therefore both of them deficient in science and in\r\ncommon sense. If men were made according to our notions, there should\r\nnot be a silly one alive; but it is otherwise ordered, and there is no\r\ndepartment of human life in which we do not find weak and foolish men.\r\nThis is true of farming as much as of any other calling. But no one\r\ndreams of setting down the vocation of agriculture because, like every\r\nother, it has its proportion of stupid men.\r\n\r\nWhy then should agricultural _writers_, as a class, be summarily\r\nrejected because some of them are visionary? Are we not to be allowed\r\nour share of fools as well as every other department of life? We\r\ninsist on our rights.\r\n\r\nA book or a paper never proposes to take the place of a farmer’s\r\n_judgment_. Not to read at all is bad enough; but to read, and swallow\r\neverything without reflection, or discrimination, this is even worse.\r\nSuch a one is not a book-headed but a block-headed farmer. Papers are\r\ndesigned to _assist_. Those who read them must select, modify, and act\r\naccording to their own native judgment. So used, papers answer a\r\ndouble purpose; they convey a great amount of valuable practical\r\ninformation, and then they stir up the reader to habits of thought;\r\nthey make him more inquisitive, more observing, more reasoning, and,\r\ntherefore, more reasonable.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the contents of agricultural papers, whose fault is it if\r\nthey are not _practical_? Who are the practical men? who are daily\r\nconversant with just the things a cultivator most needs to know? who\r\nis stumbling upon difficulties, or discovering some escape from them?\r\nwho is it that knows so much about gardens, orchards, farms, cattle,\r\ngrains and grasses? Why, the very men _who won’t write a word for the\r\npaper that they read_, and then complain that there is nothing\r\n_practical in it_. Yes there is. There is practical evidence that men\r\nare more willing to be helped than to help others; and also that men\r\nsometimes blame others for things of which they themselves are chiefly\r\nblameworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD BREEDS OF COWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is hardly one thing which conduces more to the comfort of a\r\nfamily than a good cow. A family well supplied with rich milk twice a\r\nday cannot have poor fare; for, besides the use of pure milk by\r\nitself, there is no article, except flour, which enters into so many\r\nforms of cooking. Next in importance to the family, are the relations\r\nof the cow to the dairy; we say _next_ to the family, for it is more\r\nimportant that there should be good cows for private families than\r\nthat dairies should have them. All the dairy herds might be destroyed,\r\nand if each family has its cow, the loss would be bearable. But take\r\nfrom families their one cow, and all the dairies in the land could not\r\ncompensate.\r\n\r\nThe question of a good breed of milch cows is important, then, to the\r\nwhole community; to the dairymen of course; but yet more to the\r\nfamilies of laborers, mechanics, merchants, etc.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that it costs no more to keep a good cow than a poor\r\none. But what is the use in talking so when good ones are not to be\r\nhad? or to be had only at a price which not one in fifty can afford?\r\nBut so far as we are concerned, and so far as ninety-nine in a hundred\r\nare concerned, of what use are these accounts except to make us\r\ndissatisfied with our poor old cow without enabling us to get a\r\nbetter? It was all right to publish them, but the sight of such facts\r\nreminded us of the low estate of our milk cows, and of the woeful\r\ncarelessness of farmers about improving their stock.\r\n\r\nIt is high time that farmers should endeavor to procure a good milk\r\nbreed. It is well known that horses and oxen are almost bred to order;\r\nif a fore shoulder is too slight, a breeder crosses so that in the\r\nnext generation it comes out right; if the animal is too small he is\r\nenlarged; if too large he is condensed; if the back is too long, the\r\nleg too heavy, the muscle too spare, the head heavily or clumsily put\r\non, the breeder has skill, in a great measure, to remedy the evils.\r\nWhy then should it not be thought both possible and worth while to\r\nbreed for good milking properties?\r\n\r\nThe least trouble, not the best stock, seems to be the question with\r\nmost. The discouragement of debt, the low prices of all farm products,\r\nthe habits of arrant carelessness which naturally belong to large\r\nfarms, of rich lands, removed from a ready market, and on which there\r\nis more than enough for home use, and much waste of the surplus\r\nbecause a poor sale for it; these things are the causes why but little\r\nattention is paid to good stock. To be sure, in speculating times,\r\nlarge prices have been paid for animals of repute. And now, if fancy\r\nprices could be realized, there are thousands who would beg, borrow,\r\nor steal enough to rush madly into the raising of improved breeds.\r\nEven from such extravagance much collateral advantage results. Many,\r\ndoubtless, are disappointed, as they expected angelic cattle, and got\r\nnothing but flesh and blood; those who are the most furious in one\r\nextreme, revolt to the other, and are as careless and neglectful this\r\nyear, as they were cattle-mad the last year. But, some good,\r\nnotwithstanding, remains. Good breeds have been brought in. Good blood\r\nwill run longer in good stock, than perseverance, often, will in their\r\nowners. Here and there a man holds on. His stock improves. His\r\nneighbor’s herds are gradually leavened. By and by particular counties\r\ngrow famous for their fine stock. The farmers feel some pride in it;\r\nand now the thing begins to work rightly. When once the best stock, of\r\nany kind, is a matter of hearty personal pride with the farmer, over\r\nand above the mere price of them in market, then there will be\r\nconstant and solid improvement.\r\n\r\nThese remarks, applying to stock generally, are peculiarly applicable\r\nto the subject of milch cows with which we set out.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nDAHLIAS.—It is necessary to give your plants a strong support, for, in\r\ngood seasons, they grow so thriftily, that rains and winds break down\r\nthe branches even when the main stalk is strongly staked. Those who\r\nare willing to be at the trouble, should put three stakes so as to\r\nleave the stem in the middle. Take a pliant withe, or small hoop, and\r\nencircle the stakes at the top, the middle, and also about a foot from\r\nthe ground. In this way the branches will lean on the hoops, and not\r\nbe liable to split off; a few weeks’ growth will cover and conceal the\r\nstakes and hoops, leaving to the eye only a mass of foliage,\r\napparently, self-sustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTING AND CURING GRASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question when grass ought to be cut, it seems to us, is to be\r\nanswered by the purposes to which we mean to put it.\r\n\r\nDo we wish it for the seed, or for the stem? Are we anxious to obtain\r\nthe greatest weight from an acre? or are we desirous of gaining the\r\nlargest amount with the least exhaustion of the soil?\r\n\r\n1. If one, regardless of soil, wishes the greatest weight to an acre,\r\nlet the grass ripen. It will have become perfectly developed; its\r\njuices will have perfected the solid matter, and less loss will ensue\r\nin curing. But the stem will be comparatively hard, and without\r\nnutriment.\r\n\r\n2. Do we desire, without particular regard to economy, the most\r\nnutricious food for animals? The grass should ripen and _only the\r\nupper part of the stem_ and the head should be fed out; for, while the\r\nbuts will be hard and juiceless, the grain and husk and neighboring\r\nparts will have received, in a concentrated form, the height of the\r\nplant’s juices. Chemistry has recently shown that plants prepare in\r\nthemselves, the fatty matter which is afterward laid on the bones of\r\nthe cattle. This fatty substance lies not in the grain, but the husk.\r\n\r\nJohnston, the agricultural chemist, says “This fact of the existence\r\nof more fat in the husk than in the inner part of the grain, explains\r\nwhat often seems inexplicable to the practical man, why bran, namely,\r\nwhich _appears_ to contain little or no nourishing substance, should\r\nyet fatten pigs and other full grown animals when fed to them in\r\nsufficient quantity, along with their other food.” If for example, a\r\nhorse is to be trained, it has long been the _practice_ (though\r\nhitherto the reason was not understood) to give the racers, the\r\nhunter, etc., only the top joint and head of hay. Now the principle on\r\nwhich a trained horse is fed, is to give the most solid nourishment in\r\nthe most compact form—throwing as little unnutricious food as possible\r\ninto the stomach consistently with a proper distension of it.\r\n\r\nThis fact also explains the value of old hay which has been well cured\r\nand well kept. It is known that freshly gathered nuts are not so oily\r\nas those which are old. All seeds perfect their oil after being\r\nthoroughly ripened by keeping. The seed of old hay will be richer in\r\nfatty matter, then, than new.\r\n\r\n3. The most palatable hay for cattle is that which is cut before it\r\nripens its seed. If the farmer has enough grain to feed with, he can\r\nafford to cut his grass early. Its want of nutriment will be made up\r\nby feeding grain, and his stock will relish their food better than if\r\nit had grown hard with age before cutting.\r\n\r\n4. _But for general purposes_, grass should be cut when just out of\r\nflower. This is a compromise between the two extremes. It combines the\r\ntwo advantages of juiciness of stem and richness of grain more nearly\r\nthan any other. The stem will be cut while yet in juice, and the seed\r\nwill continue to fill and ripen _after it has been cut_. This is well\r\nknown in respect to wheat, and the best farmers cut it before it is\r\ndead ripe.\r\n\r\nThe want of barns to store it, the want of markets in which to sell\r\nit, the want of profit in raising it, and lastly, the want of thrift\r\nin making it, has caused thousands of tons of hay to be most\r\nwretchedly put up—_curing_ as it is sarcastically called; cured,\r\nprobably, on the principle of the following story: A physician in\r\nEngland went out with the gamekeeper to hunt; covey after covey was\r\nstarted, into which the doctor fired with a strange want of\r\nprofessional skill, without killing anything. The gamekeeper at length\r\nlost patience, and snatching the gun, said:\r\n\r\n“Let me take it, I’ll doctor them.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, sir, by _doctoring_ them?”\r\n\r\n“Why, kill them, to be sure.”\r\n\r\nThus, we think, grass is too often doctored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY AND CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA worthy friend recently said to me: “A gentlemen of observation from\r\none of our principal cities of the West, stated to me, that in point\r\nof fact, almost all the leading men of the cities were from the\r\ncountry, and had been raised farmers’ sons. The reasons seemed to me\r\nquite obvious. The vigorous health, patient industry, thorough\r\neconomy, and hard thinking necessary to success, are the product of\r\nthe country and but seldom of the town or city. A large part of the\r\nbest merit and talent of the country doubtless remains upon and adorns\r\nour farms. Another portion is drawn by a spirit for enterprise of a\r\ndifferent kind to our towns. When they enter they find an active\r\ncompetition that brings out their best efforts. Success on their part\r\ntakes away the necessity of effort on the part of their children; and\r\nthe next result is, that their children become reduced in means and\r\nmerit, and every element of success, and are driven to some refuge in\r\nvice or petty employment. It is therefore the duty of the man who has\r\nbeen successful in town, to retire to the country again that his\r\nchildren, who are to succeed him, may partake, as far as possible, of\r\nhis advantages.”\r\n\r\nThe _facts_ stated we believe are undoubted; the business\r\nmen—merchants, lawyers, physicians, and clergymen of large cities are,\r\nto a large degree, drawn from the country. And there is a system of\r\n_circulation_, if the facts could be well made out, worth attention.\r\nIn travelling, one day last year, the rain drove us into a country\r\ntavern, where a fat man of some fifty years of age was waiting to\r\nentertain us with a dish of philosophy (of which, considering our\r\naccommodations, we had special need). But we were led to notice one\r\npart of his remarks: “You see, sir, everything comes round in about\r\nfour generations. First comes the enterprising and hard-working fellow\r\nwho gets the money; then his children begin to live in style; but\r\ntheir parents’ example and stamina keep them pretty well up; but\r\n_their_ children begin to run down; in their hands the property is\r\nwasted and they die poor; and the fourth race begin in poverty, and\r\nwork upward again.” Now, if our fat and somewhat dogmatical friend has\r\nreasoned aright, there is a degenerating and rejuvenating process\r\ngoing on in society, having a period of about four or five years. We\r\ngive the theory for what it may be worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME UPON WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLime is used either to prepare the seed for germination, or to prepare\r\nthe soil for the better growth of the seed. This latter operation it\r\ndoes, either by adding itself as a new ingredient, or by acting\r\nchemically upon the ingredients already in the soil.\r\n\r\nWhen lime is applied _to the seed_ (the seed being moist) the oxygen\r\nof the water, combining with carbon of the seed, forms carbonic acid;\r\nwhich, having a powerful affinity for lime, unites with it, forming a\r\ncarbonate of lime. The escape of a portion of its carbon constitutes\r\nthe natural preparation of a seed for growth; but why, chemists have\r\nnot been able to explain.\r\n\r\nAir-slaked lime, is lime which has combined with carbonic acid\r\nexisting in the atmosphere. Unburnt limestone is a carbonate of lime;\r\nair-slaked lime is the same, and they do not materially differ.\r\nAir-slaked lime, having no longer an affinity for carbonic acid,\r\nwithdraws none from the grain to which it may be applied; and in\r\nnothing helps the germinating process. Our readers will therefore see\r\nthe reason why wheat does not sprout any quicker when it is limed,\r\nthan when it is not. Precisely the same thing is true of other\r\nsubstances applied to grains. Magnesia, existing naturally as a\r\ncarbonate, like lime, has its carbonic acid expelled by strong heat,\r\nand in that state applied to seeds, will assist the germination. If\r\nexposed to the air it attracts carbonic acid and becomes again a\r\ncarbonate, and useless to seeds.\r\n\r\nWhere lime is employed _upon the soil_, it is either as a mere article\r\nof vegetable food, or, as a chemical agent, to change the condition of\r\nother ingredients of the soil. All good soils contain lime; of\r\nninety-four different cultivated soils in Rhode Island, analyzed by\r\nProfessor C. T. Jackson, _eighty-nine_ contained lime. Ruffin, in his\r\nessay on calcareous manures, says, after a large induction of fact,\r\n“that all soils naturally poor, are certainly destitute of calcareous\r\nearth.” When there exists in the soil, already, enough lime for the\r\nwants of vegetation, the addition of more will produce no effect upon\r\nthe crop. New lands, and old land not run down, and naturally rich in\r\nlime, may require none. But lime is applied not alone as food directly\r\noffered to vegetation, but to act upon and change the soil itself.\r\n\r\nIt _neutralises_ free acids which exist in the soil. This is done with\r\nquick-lime or air-slaked; the first combining directly with the\r\nacid—the second by liberating its carbonic acid and then combining\r\nwith the acid of the soil, leaving the carbonic acid to be food for\r\nplants. It is very well known by those accustomed to use peaty\r\nsubstances for manures, and meadow mud, that they will rather injure\r\nthan benefit soils, until their acid has been neutralized.\r\n\r\nLime _decomposes_ vegetable fibre, and reduces tough ligneous\r\nsubstances, to a consideration in which they can be appropriated by\r\nplants. For this purpose _quick-lime_ should be used and may be\r\napplied at the rate of from twenty to thirty bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\nLime enters into combination with sand or silex, forming a substance\r\ndifferent from either of them. Even strong clays will be found to\r\ncontain much silex; and lime, by combining with it, makes the soil\r\nfriable or crumbling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURE OF HOPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall state such facts as are within our reach, and leave each one\r\nto make his own calculations.\r\n\r\nTHE HOP PLANT.—The hop belongs to the natural order, Urticeæ, or the\r\nnettle and hemp family. Its root is perennial; its stem annual,\r\ntwining to the height of from fifteen to twenty feet. They bear male\r\nand female flowers on different plants, and the female is the only one\r\nused for planting.\r\n\r\nSOIL.—Rich, friable clay, and hearty loams, and vegetable molds are\r\nthe best soils. A wet subsoil is fatal to their health. Any rich,\r\nlight, dry (but not droughty) soil suits them. A large crop may be\r\nobtained from our rich alluvions, or bottom lands; but although\r\nuplands yield a less crop, the quality is regarded as decidedly\r\nsuperior. A wet clay subsoil is not good.\r\n\r\nPLANTING.—Plants are set out in rows six to eight feet apart and six\r\nto eight feet from hill to hill in the row. Rooted plants, but more\r\nfrequently cuttings from old plants are employed; five or six being\r\nplanted to the hill. Poles from fifteen to twenty feet in length are\r\nplaced to each hill. In England from three to six and even eight are\r\nplaced to each hill. But three is about the average number.\r\n\r\nHARVEST.—No crop is more variable than this; the yield per acre\r\nranging according to the season from 300 to 2,000 lbs. On rich bottom\r\nlands 2,000 lbs. may be not unfrequently raised; but on an average,\r\nfrom 700 to 1,000 lbs. may be reckoned.\r\n\r\nThe plants bloom in July and are ready for harvest by the first of\r\nSeptember. It is necessary to gather them promptly, as they soon\r\ndeteriorate if allowed to remain after they are ripe. As soon as\r\ngathered they are kiln-dried, then placed from ten days to two weeks\r\nto cool, and, finally, they are baled for market.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.—A plantation will last in full vigor for ten\r\nyears, and then will decline, but gradually, for ten more, when it is\r\nto be broken up. Fifteen years, perhaps, is the average duration of\r\nthe hop plantations. They exhaust the soil, withdrawing much and\r\nreturning little to it. Hops vary exceedingly in price in different\r\nyears, not only on account of the varying supply arising from the\r\nuncertainty of yield, but from the quality of the article in different\r\nyears. The average price in the United States is not far from sixteen\r\ncents per pound. Sometimes they rise to thirty, forty, and even fifty\r\ncents per pound.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of sprouting, in the spring, until the hop is ready\r\nfor the kiln, they are liable to disaster from insects or disease.\r\nNowhere has more experience been had in their cultivation than in\r\nEngland. Brown says, “they are exposed to more diseases than any other\r\nplant with which we are acquainted, and the trade offers greater room\r\nfor speculation than any other exercised within the British\r\ndominions.” Parkinson, with a quaint play upon the word hop, says,\r\n“the _hop_ is said to be a plant very properly named, as there is\r\nnever any certainty in cultivating it.”\r\n\r\nIf the crop is to be planted largely, it would seem plain, from the\r\nforegoing, that one should have capital enough to be able to bear some\r\nlosses, at least, at first. For ordinary cultivators, if the\r\nexperiment is to be made, it would be better to begin with a small\r\nplantation at first, embarking more largely as knowledge and skill\r\nincrease, and as experience determines its profitableness.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nGRAPE VINES should be trimmed before the sap begins to rise, else they\r\nwill bleed, to their great injury. If it be neglected till the sap is\r\nin motion, let the cultivator wait till the leaves are about the size\r\nof a dollar; then cutting may be performed without injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE CLOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are inclined to suppose that the excellences of white clover have\r\nnot been enough esteemed among our farmers; indeed, they have adopted\r\na few grasses as special favorites upon whom all favors are lavished,\r\nand the rest are totally or very nearly rejected.\r\n\r\nIn regions where dairies abound, and where, therefore, the subject of\r\npasturage is of vital interest, those grasses are sown which spring\r\nearly in the year and continue late; which grow quickly, abundantly,\r\nand shoot again rapidly after being cropped; which are nutritious;\r\nwhich tend to produce milk, and impart to it high flavor. If any _one_\r\ngrass possessed all these properties, it would be perfect; and, for\r\npastures, all others might be rejected. As it is, several grasses must\r\nconspire to form a _sward_ possessed of these diverse excellences. In\r\nthis joint result white clover bears no mean place. It is, on\r\ncongenial soils, of vigorous growth, eminently conducive to the\r\nproduction of milk, and milk of fine flavor. These are its peculiar\r\nvirtues. Besides these, it possesses in common with other pasture\r\nplants, hardiness, tenacity of life, nutritiousness for beef-cattle.\r\nThaër, the most eminent practical, and scientific cultivator of his\r\nday, says: “_It is certainly the most generally approved of all plants\r\nthat are cultivated for this_ (pasture) _purpose_.” Sinclair, whose\r\nauthority in grasses will not be disputed, says: “nor does it form a\r\ngood pasture when sown _by itself_ … but, combined with other grasses,\r\nit is a valuable plant.” Great quantities of seed are annually sown in\r\nEngland by the best farmers. Fessenden, of New England, says, “it does\r\nnot contain as much nutritive matter as red clover; yet its value as a\r\n_pasture-grass is universally admitted_.” This is the experience of\r\nGermany, England, and New England. Has experience determined that\r\nthese good qualities are suppressed in western pastures? Or is there\r\nsuch a prejudice against it on account of its prying, intrusive\r\ndisposition in arable lands, that our farmers are unwilling to give it\r\na chance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOWING CORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany farmers, because their fathers did so before them, plow their\r\ncorn lands very shallow before planting; but make up for it in deep\r\nplowing while dressing the corn crop. Why is corn plowed at all?\r\n\r\n1. TO DESTROY WEEDS.—In this climate if a plow is not kept lively in\r\nthe early part of the season, weeds will completely take the crop. The\r\nsoil is like a table full of food. Every man who sits down to it makes\r\nit less. Every weed eats up a part of the soil, and takes away,\r\nneedlessly, so much from the corn. But it is not merely the nutritive\r\ningredients which are extracted—but what, on some soils, in some\r\nseasons, is even worse—weeds drink up the moisture. There are many\r\nsoils which could afford to lose much mineral and vegetable substance\r\nwithout lessening the supply for corn; but, in this climate, in\r\nordinary seasons, no soil can afford to squander its moisture.\r\n\r\nBut a corn crop is often put in to act as a cleanser of the soil when\r\nit has become foul. This end can only be answered by a rigid\r\npersecution and destruction of the weeds throughout the whole growing\r\nseason. Some farmers, strangely enough, will deal thoroughly with\r\ntheir fields, but allow the edges and fence rows to swarm with weeds\r\nthat luxuriate and ripen seed which the winds scatter all over the\r\nfield. This is as if a man should busy himself all day long, in\r\ndriving hogs out of his field, but leave all the holes open where they\r\nbroke in. The soil should be thoroughly worked.\r\n\r\n2. TO PREVENT DRYNESS.—Nothing is wider of the truth, than letting\r\ncorn alone in dry weather for fear of “firing” it. If the plow begins\r\nearly, and is kept going, no drought likely to occur in our climate\r\ncan do much injury; especially if the ground has been broken up deep\r\nbefore planting.\r\n\r\nWhere the atmosphere is very dry, very hot and windy, the evaporation\r\nof moisture from the plant, and from the surface of the soil, is\r\nexcessive. A hill of corn will exhale many pounds of moisture in a\r\nday. There is no remedy for excessive exhalation from plants; but this\r\nrenders it yet more necessary that a supply should be kept up at the\r\nroots. If the soil therefore, is permitted to evaporate from its\r\nsurface, the double draught upon its moisture—through the plant, and\r\nfrom the surface—will soon exhaust its water.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that if a board or cloth be put upon the ground, in\r\ndry weather, the earth under it will remain moist—its aqueous\r\nparticles being checked in their passage upward. If a shovelful of\r\nfine manure be laid in a heap upon a spot of ground, the same effect\r\nwill be produced. Gardeners are accustomed to cover the earth about\r\nshrubs with an inch or two of fine sand; experience teaching them that\r\nit preserves the moisture of the soil. Now, if the soil, instead of\r\nbeing covered with sand, or light manure, be itself pulverized, the\r\nsame effect will be produced—and for reasons which will appear. When\r\nthe soil is compact the moisture ascends from particle to particle\r\nwithout obstruction. Every crevice which separates the particles of\r\nearth, checks the passage of the moisture. This may be more readily\r\nseen in an analogous case—the transmission of heat. Take two\r\nnail-rods, lay the end of one in the fire; divide the other into inch\r\npieces and lay them in a row from the fire, each piece touching the\r\nother. The transmission of heat in the rod made up of pieces will be\r\nchecked at each point of division, while the uncut rod will heat\r\nrapidly. On this principle, an iron chain two feet long, with one end\r\nthrust into fire, will not transmit heat through its length near so\r\nsoon as a solid bar of the same length.\r\n\r\nIf this reasoning be true, and experience bears it out, the plow\r\nshould be kept running in dry times to save a crop from drought. But\r\nif the farmer has neglected his corn, waiting for rain, and begins to\r\nplow after his ground is very dry, and plows deep, _breaking the\r\nroots_ of his corn, the crop will be “fired;” for, in this case,\r\nbesides the evaporation from the leaves and the dryness of the soil,\r\nhe commences breaking the roots by which the crop drinks what little\r\nwater there may be left for it. Of course it despairs when it is\r\nattacked on one side by the heat, and on the other by the foolish\r\nfarmer, and underneath by a treacherously dry soil. Begin, then,\r\nearly, and plow often, and you may defy dry summers and cram your crib\r\nwith hearty crops of corn.\r\n\r\nBREAKING THE ROOTS.—Many farmers study to break the roots of their\r\ncorn. We have heard them boast of ripping them up with a big plow till\r\nthey clogged it up like bundles of yarn. It is done by some because\r\nothers do it; those who attempt to reason, say, that if a root be\r\nbroken it immediately puts out many more from the point of breakage;\r\nand the practice of root-pruning fruit-trees is cited, to show that\r\nthe fruitfulness of a plant is increased by reducing the root and\r\nchecking the growth of the wood. It is not true that the fruitfulness\r\nof a tree is increased by root-pruning, but, it is made to yield its\r\nfruit _earlier_. It is a device to bring trees rapidly into bearing. A\r\npear-tree (grafted) requires from five to eight years before it is\r\nmatured enough to commence bearing. By mutilation of root, bending of\r\nbranches, or by a poor gravelly soil, the tree is partially forbidden\r\nto grow, and obliged to ripen its wood and fit it for fruit-bearing.\r\nBut had it grown to its natural size, it would then have borne even\r\nmore fruit than when dwarfed.\r\n\r\nNo such practice is required upon annual plants, whose ripening is not\r\ndelayed through years, but which come up and ripen and die within the\r\nlimits of a single season. They need no artificial treatment to\r\naccelerate the fruiting, because it ordinarily makes no difference\r\nwhether the corn crop comes in September or October. It is better to\r\nselect varieties of corn which ripen within the limits of the season\r\nnatural to the region where it is planted. Then there will be no\r\noccasion to break roots, or to apply any other artificial and violent\r\nprocess to accelerate maturation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAN OUT YOUR CELLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI speak to those who have cellars. If not already done, thoroughly\r\npurge this subterranean story of your house. Every decayed onion,\r\ncabbage stump, potato vine or tuber, turnip, parsnip, carrot, and all\r\nthe dirt they have made, all straw and rubbish, rake them up and out\r\nwith them. The cellar is no place for them at any time of year. If you\r\nstill retain a few potatoes for table use, let them be picked over and\r\nall decayed ones removed. One of the best housewives of our\r\nacquaintance, greeted us not long since, with an invitation to come\r\nand see her cellar: “I have swept down every cobweb, whitewashed the\r\nwalls, swept up the floor, and sowed it with salt.” Decayed vegetable\r\nmatter is a fertile cause of disease, and there is enough of it out of\r\ndoors, in this country, without heaping it up in the cellar for the\r\nspecial purpose, it would almost seem, of breeding fevers. Whitewash\r\nthe walls, for lime purifies as well as beautifies. Rake down the\r\ncobwebs, they are the infallible marks of a _slattern_. Every spider\r\nthat is allowed to peer out of his corner in a house, up-stairs or\r\ndown, undisturbed, points his long black leg in thanksgiving at the\r\nhousewife, “Hurra for folks that are not too particular.” Old legends\r\nrepresent witches as addicted to riding brooms. I wish that many women\r\nwould get bewitched enough to do this, something more than they do.\r\nDown cellar, then, with your broom. Look now; the window is perfectly\r\ncovered; there is a great sprawling gaunt spider in the corner and\r\nhalf a dozen empty bugs hung up like scalps to commemorate his\r\ntriumphs; next to him is a great over-swollen potbellied fellow—for\r\nall the world he looks like a huge glutton; then there is a sharp,\r\nnimble, enterprising spider, below him, who has just opened an office\r\nand is keen for business, preparing to inherit, like many other\r\nfellows, his neighbor’s custom, who, having got rich fraudulently,\r\nwill soon burst; there, too, are several pale and shadowy spiders, who\r\nlook as if the cobwebs had kept them from the light until they had\r\nbecome quite sallow and emaciated; then there are several little\r\nround, shining-black, pestilent fellows, whose legs are so long in\r\nproportion to their bodies, that they make one think of a little\r\npotato with yard-long sprouts all over it. I say nothing of\r\ncrab-spiders on the window-sill, who, like metaphysicians, run\r\nbackward just as easy as forwards. Just look, too, my dear madam, at\r\nthe various patterns of their webs. Here is one from point to point\r\nresembling a sheet-like shelf of dusty cotton, and running like a\r\ntunnel, into a knot hole, where stands the venomous old fellow waiting\r\nfor flies, like a usurer waiting for customers. Another corner is\r\nfilled up with a web like a skein of tangled silk; then there is a\r\nbeautiful wheel, worked more beautifully than any lace-work, while\r\nthere are a multitude of base and lazy little spiders who, like many\r\nof their betters, live on other folk’s webs. Well, we have talked long\r\nenough; dash your brush into that spider-village, give it a dextrous\r\ntwirl, and with the whole population on the end of it, run to the door\r\nand crush them! So much for spiders.\r\n\r\nAs to salt; the only advantage of salt in a cellar, that occurs to us,\r\nis its effect in destroying snails, bugs, and that fungus vegetation\r\ncalled mold. It will do this. But it attracts moisture from the\r\natmosphere and renders a cellar damp. If your cellar is very dry and\r\nsandy, you may use salt without detriment. But if too damp it will\r\nmake the matter worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN IS HAYING OVER?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a trip through the country last summer we saw several fields of\r\ntimothy, out of blossom, which had become dry, seedy, and\r\nsnuff-colored. Haying was not over, it seems. Cattle that had been\r\nhardened to eat iron-weed stems, jimpsum stalks, and packing straw,\r\nwould probably be willing to eat this hay.\r\n\r\nWe saw another sight. Hay which had been cut and partly cured, was\r\ncocked up and had been left, probably for a week or two already; and,\r\ndoubtless, was to stand thus much longer, for there is a fashion with\r\nsome to let their hay lie about the field in little three-feet cocks,\r\n_until it is convenient_ to haul it to the stack. This may be in\r\nAugust, or September, and sometimes we have seen a farmer (so called)\r\nwith a little sled and rope hauling his hay in October. Now, hay thus\r\nserved is good for nothing but for litter. The bottom of each little\r\nheap molds; the sides are, by sun and rain, spoiled, and the little\r\nwad in the middle does not, after subtracting the sides and bottom,\r\namount to much.\r\n\r\nI’ll venture my head that these are not “book farmers.” I have no\r\ndoubt that “book farmers” do some foolish things, but farmers without\r\nbooks do a great many more. No book farmer, none but a farmer utterly\r\nwithout books, would think of leaving his hay in cocks for six weeks\r\nor two months. We see enough of such hay offered for sale every\r\nwinter, of a dingy, lack-lustre, straw-colored look, without\r\nfragrance, or odor of any sort except a faint smell of old wood, or\r\nmore pungent odor of mold.\r\n\r\nWe say, in conclusion, grass should not be left so long that it will\r\nbe already dry and cured before it is cut; and, after grass is once\r\ndown, it is not to be treated like flax, and left to bleach and rot,\r\nbut should be got in _as soon as possible_. Farmers whose hay is on\r\nthe stack or in the mow may laugh at this article; those whose hay is\r\nnot stacked or in the barn had better do something besides laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING DOWN LAND TO GRASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall speak of the kinds and quality of seed, and of the time and\r\nmanner of putting them in.\r\n\r\nWe think our farmers err in not sowing enough kinds of seed together.\r\n\r\nThe objects to be secured are very early grass in the spring, a heavy\r\nbody of hay, a rapid after-growth, and the greatest amount which the\r\nsoil can yield. No one grass can be found capable of meeting all these\r\nends. Some are very early, but not heavy enough or sufficiently\r\nnutritious for the main crop; others are admirable for hay, but do not\r\nstart readily again after cutting. By judiciously mixing different\r\nsorts of grasses, any one of these objects may be secured and the\r\nmeadow be admirable both for the scythe and for pasturage. Nor can the\r\nsoil be made to yield all of which it is capable in any other way; for\r\na square foot of ground may be able to sustain but a certain number of\r\nroots of any _one kind_ of grass, and yet many support, in addition,\r\nas much more of another kind, since different species of grass draw\r\ntheir nourishment from different portions of the soil—the\r\nfibrous-rooted grasses from the surface, and tap-rooted plants from\r\nthe lower strata of the soil, while broad-leaved vegetation, as\r\nclovers, lucerne, etc., draw very much of their support from the air.\r\nIndeed, this is the lesson which Nature teaches us, for a dozen kinds\r\nof grass may oftentimes be found growing wild on a single square foot.\r\n\r\nThe English farmer sows from four to seven or eight kinds of\r\ngrass-seed, and sometimes as high as twelve or fourteen, each one of\r\nwhich is destined to answer some special end, and the whole taken\r\ntogether constitute as it were, a perfect grass.\r\n\r\nWe subjoin the quantity and kind of seed per acre recommended by\r\nEnglish authorities, that our readers may have an idea of the English\r\nmethod, and derive such benefit from it as their circumstances will\r\nadmit of:\r\n\r\n  Smooth-stalked poa,                    8 quarts.\r\n  Rough-stalked poa,                     8   “\r\n  Meadow fescue,                        12   “\r\n  Meadow fox-tail,                       8   “\r\n  Crested dog’s-tail,                    6   “\r\n  Rib-grass,                             4   “\r\n  Timothy-grass,                         4   “\r\n  Yellow oat-grass,                      4   “\r\n  Perennial rye-grass,                  12   “\r\n  Cock’s foot,                           4   “\r\n  Yarrow,                                4   “\r\n  Sweet-scented vernal,                  2   “\r\n  White clover,                          6  lbs.\r\n  Cow-grass,                             4   “\r\n            and annual meadow-grass.\r\n\r\nThese seeds may, for the most part, be had of eastern dealers, though\r\nnot probably in the West.\r\n\r\nWith blue grass we should join orchard grass, say a bushel to the\r\nacre—white clover five pounds, red clover ten pounds, and\r\nsweet-scented vernal (_anthoxanthum odoratum_) say three pounds.\r\n\r\nThis last grass is remarkably early in the spring, and peculiarly\r\nfragrant; indeed, it is supposed that the famous spring butter of\r\nPhiladelphia derives its peculiar flavor from this grass, and we\r\nshould include it in every mixture to be sown for pasturage. The\r\norchard grass is one of our most valuable; for hay it may be inferior\r\nto timothy; but it is decidedly superior to it for pasturage. Colonel\r\nPowell, of Pennsylvania, after growing it ten years, declares that it\r\nproduces more pasturage than any cultivated grass he has even seen in\r\nAmerica. It should be spread on a floor and sprinkled with water a day\r\nor two before sowing, it being very light, not weighing more than\r\ntwelve or fourteen pounds to the bushel.\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits the quantity of seed, by _weight_, and\r\nalso on the three kinds of soil:\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOR PERMANENT PASTURE, PER IMPERIAL ACRE.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+---------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n  |                      |  LIGHT SOIL.  |  MEDIUM SOIL.  |  HEAVY SOIL.  |\r\n  |                      +------+--------+-------+--------+------+--------+\r\n  |                      |With a|Without |With a |Without |With a|Without |\r\n  |                      | Crop | a Crop | Crop  | a Crop | Crop | a Crop |\r\n  |                      +------+--------+-------+--------+------+--------+\r\n  |                      | lbs. |   lbs. |  lbs. |  lbs.  | lbs. |  lbs.  |\r\n  |Perennial rye-grass   |  12  |   24   |  12   |   24   |  12  |   24   |\r\n  |Meadow fox-tail       |   1¼ |    2½  |   2   |    4   |   3¼ |    6½  |\r\n  |Timothy-grass         |  —   |    —   |   1½  |    3   |   3¼ |    5½  |\r\n  |Meadow fescue         |   2½ |    4   |   2½  |    4   |   2½ |    4   |\r\n  |Cock’s-foot           |   5  |    8   |   3¼  |    6½  |   2½ |    4   |\r\n  |Rough-stalked poa     |  —   |    —   |   1¾  |    3¼  |   3¼ |    6½  |\r\n  |Smooth-stalked poa    |   3¼ |    6½  |   1½  |    3¼  |  —   |   —    |\r\n  |White clover          |   5  |    8   |   5   |    8   |   5  |    8   |\r\n  |Red clover            |   1½ |    2½  |   1½  |    2½  |   1½ |    2½  |\r\n  |Hop-clover, or trefoil|   1½ |    2½  |   1½  |    2½  |   1½ |    2½  |\r\n  |Cow-grass             |   1½ |    2½  |   1½  |    2½  |   1½ |    2½  |\r\n  |                      +------+--------+-------+--------+------+--------+\r\n  |                      |  33½ |   60½  |  34   |   63½  |  36¼ |   66   |\r\n  +----------------------+------+--------+-------+--------+------+--------+\r\n\r\nThere is a very great difference of opinion respecting the quantity of\r\nseed to be sown to an acre. There can be no doubt that the question is\r\nto be settled by the character of the soil and climate. In soils and\r\nunder circumstances where every seed will vegetate and grow off with\r\nunobstructed vigor, less seed is needed than where a part will be\r\ntaken by frosts, a part by drenching rains which are not well drained\r\noff, and a part by severe drought. Every farmer must employ his best\r\njudgment in this matter; but, it is better to err on the side of too\r\nmuch than of too little seed.\r\n\r\nTIME OF SEEDING.—We cannot pretend to decide between the conflicting\r\nopinions on this subject. The positiveness of those who prefer\r\nspring-sowing is only to be equalled by that of those who prefer\r\nfall-planting. Young says of the month of August, “this is the best\r\nseason of the whole year for laying down land to grass, and no other\r\nis admissible for it on strong, wet, or heavy soils.” This, however,\r\nis said of humid England. But if the character of the season toward\r\nthe close of summer favors, there can be no doubt that fall-sowing\r\nwill advance the crop very early the next year, in all soils where it\r\nis not liable to be thrown out by the frosts. If the winter proves\r\nsevere, it will be prudent to add an additional quantity of seed in\r\nthe spring. It is objected to spring sowings, that the grass is grown\r\nin the shade during the early part of the summer, and is, of course,\r\n_tender_, so that when the grain is cut, it is enfeebled by the\r\npowerful heat, to which, then, it becomes exposed. On the whole, we\r\nare inclined to prefer the month of September, if the season favors,\r\nto any other for sowing grass seed. Since writing these lines, one of\r\nour best farmers informs us that he prefers August to any other month.\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF SOWING.—The ground should be very thoroughly prepared by\r\ndeep and fine plowing, and the want of labor in this respect is want\r\nof economy.\r\n\r\nIf the soil is naturally well drained, no further provision against\r\nwet will be required. But if it be flat, it may be well to lay it off\r\ninto lands, strike a furrow through the centre, and then turn the\r\nfurrows toward the outer on each side. This will give a slight\r\nelevation at the middle and a drain between each land sufficient to\r\nanswer the purpose of moderate surface draining. The seed should be\r\nsown with the greatest _evenness_ possible. The English farmer prefers\r\nto sow some of the kinds separately on this account; for although he\r\nhas to sow the whole ground several times over, experience has taught\r\nhim, as it will us, that that is the cheapest which is done the best.\r\nLet it be covered in well with a harrow, and not with a bush, which\r\nlast leaves the soil dead, and tends to drag the seed into patches and\r\nhollows. As a general rule, grass seed may be planted as deeply as\r\ngrain. Farmers lose much more seed from shallow than from deep\r\nplanting. For although shallow-planted seed vegetates sooner, they are\r\nmore liable to be winter-killed, or to perish by drought than those\r\nwhich are deeply covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very well known that a young orchard will not, usually, flourish\r\non the site of an old one; for the older trees are supposed to have\r\nwithdrawn from the soil certain elements necessary to their growth;\r\nand as necessary to the growth of the young tree, should it be planted\r\nthere. There is no “like” or “dislike” of the soil to the tree; it is\r\na plain case of starvation. The tree needs, and the soil cannot supply\r\ncertain elements of its wood.\r\n\r\nBut if, after a plant has abstracted from the soil certain\r\ningredients, the whole plant is decomposed and returned to the earth,\r\nthe soil repossesses itself of the lost elements, and is ready to\r\nyield them up again to a plant of the same kind. If the straw of wheat\r\nbe burned upon the field, annually, the soil would yield fine crops\r\nfor a thousand successive years, that is so far as the _straw is\r\nconcerned_. But if the grain is removed, and nothing resupplies the\r\ndrain of phosphates which it makes from the soil, the soil will in due\r\ntime, according to the original quantities in the soil, cease to yield\r\n_grain_, although the straw may be admirable. But if both straw and\r\nkernel were every year burned upon the field, as grass and its seed is\r\nupon the prairies, wheat would grow for a thousand years in\r\nsuccession. The same is true of corn, of potatoes, and of any annual\r\ncrop. When the annual growth is restored to the soil, it is\r\nrepossessed of all its treasure which had been loaned for a season. If\r\na part of the crop is removed, the soil is poorer by just so much as\r\nthe portion removed contained within it of the elements necessary to\r\nthat crop, and it must be restored artificially, _i. e. by manuring_;\r\nor by allowing the earth to prepare (by disintegration or\r\ndecomposition of its minerals) a new supply; _i. e. by fallowing_. A\r\nforest will grow for ages on the same spot, for it returns annually\r\nits leaves, and, gradually, by force of accidents and the elements,\r\nits twigs, branches, trunks, etc., to the soil again. But let the\r\nwhole product be gradually removed, and the soil would soon be unable\r\nto supply the trees their nourishment, except in cases where the soil\r\nwas very rich in the materials of growth. The forests of Germany, like\r\nour mines, are under the management of the government. It was\r\ncustomary, for a time, to allow the peasants the use of the _twigs_\r\nand _smaller branches_; but analysis has shown that in these,\r\nespecially, resides the large proportion of potash entering into the\r\ncomposition of trees; the annual removal of it debilitated the trees\r\nto an extent that obliged the Conservators to change their mode of\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in one of Mr. Horsford’s letters from Germany, we\r\nhave the question of growing plants upon their own ashes, brought, by\r\nthe ablest chemist of the age, directly to the test of experiment.\r\n\r\n     “In the spring preceding my arrival in Giessen, Professor\r\n     Liebig planted some grape scions under the windows of the\r\n     laboratory. He fed them, if I may use such an expression,\r\n     upon the ashes of the grape vine—or upon the proper\r\n     inorganic food of the grape, as shown by analyses of its\r\n     ashes. The growth has been enormous, and several of the\r\n     vines bore large clusters of grapes in the course of the\r\n     season. Indeed, I know not but all, as my attention was\r\n     drawn to them particularly only since the fruit has been\r\n     gathered. The soil otherwise is little better than a\r\n     pavement—a kind of fine gravel, in which scarcely anything\r\n     takes root.\r\n\r\n     “I was shown pots of wheat, in different stages of their\r\n     growth, that had been fed variously—some upon the inorganic\r\n     matters they needed, according to the analyses of their\r\n     ashes—others had merely shared the tribute of the general\r\n     soil. The results in numbers I don’t yet know. In\r\n     appearance, no one could be at a loss to judge of what might\r\n     be expected.”\r\n\r\nThe fact that depopulated forest-grounds change the character of their\r\ngrowth, is quite familiar to all; and the reasons of it have been\r\nvariously debated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFODDER FOR CATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the practice of soiling cattle, _i. e._ of cutting their food\r\ndaily and feeding it to them in a green state, would be profitable to\r\nmany small farmers, it is especially to be recommended to those living\r\nin towns, where pasturage is distant and expensive. Where an immediate\r\nsupply is required, corn may be sown broadcast, and cut as wanted,\r\nuntil it begins to tassel, when all should be cut and cured, and the\r\nground sown again, and a third time in the same summer.\r\n\r\nBut if half that is said of lucerne is true, and we see no reason to\r\ndoubt it, it is valuable far above all other kinds of green fodder. It\r\nstarts very early in spring; may be cut four times in a summer,\r\nyielding from four to nine tons to the acre, acccording to the\r\ncondition of the land. It is much relished by cattle, imparts no bad\r\nflavor to milk, is a very fattening food, and one sowing will last ten\r\nyears. One acre is sufficient for four or five cows. It may be sown in\r\ndrills, if the land is foul, and kept clean by hoeing, the first year;\r\nbut on clean ground it may be sown broadcast. It is hardy under the\r\ninfliction of severe frosts; and surpasses all grasses in endurance of\r\ndrought, its enormously land roots affording it moisture from a great\r\ndepth. An English writer says, its roots have been found from ten to\r\nfourteen feet below the surface; and an American writer says, that it\r\nmade, on his land, roots three feet long the first summer.\r\n\r\nWhere it is sown broadcast, it is difficult to get it through the\r\nfirst year. But if sown in drills ten inches apart, and hoed once or\r\ntwice, it may be cut twice or thrice the first season, and be entirely\r\nestablished before winter.\r\n\r\nA light, sandy soil is the best; it should not be put upon heavy and\r\nnon-friable soils, though it will flourish on even these, when fully\r\nestablished. Ten pounds of seed to the acre is enough, if drilled;\r\nfifteen pounds, if sown broadcast.\r\n\r\nThe only reason, that we can imagine, why this plant should not be\r\nextensively cultivated, is, the disrelish which our farmers too often\r\nhave to any crop requiring much care. To slash along with a plow is\r\nall well enough; but to hoe and weed is rather tedious. But these\r\noperations are required only during the first part of the first year.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR FOR FLOWERS.—Two or three drops of a saturated solution of\r\ncamphor in alcohol, put into half an ounce of soft water, forms a\r\nmixture which will revive flowers that have begun to droop and wilt,\r\nand give them freshness for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENCE OF BAD BUTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe once took occasion to give our opinion of the butter which was\r\nlargely brought to our market. The article was deemed severe; but if\r\nthey who think so had eaten of the butter they would have regarded\r\n_that_ as the more pungent of the two. We have waited a year; and are\r\nnow prepared more fully to testify against that utter abomination,\r\nslanderously called butter, so unrighteously exchanged in our market\r\nfor good money. Far the most part, the cream is totally depraved at\r\nthe start, and churning, working, and packing are only the successive\r\nsteps of an evil education by which bad inclinations are developed\r\ninto overt wickedness. We determined to keep an eye upon the matter;\r\nand now give, from life, the natural history of the butter sold.\r\n\r\nBefore doing this, we will express an opinion of what is _good\r\nbutter_.\r\n\r\n_Good butter_ is made of sweet cream, with perfect neatness; is of a\r\nhigh color, perfectly sweet, free from buttermilk, and possesses a\r\nfine grass flavor.\r\n\r\n_Tolerable butter_ differs from this only in not having a _fine\r\nflavor_. It is devoid of all unpleasant taste, but has not a high\r\nrelish.\r\n\r\nWhatever is less than this is bad butter; the catalogue is long and\r\nthe descending scale is marked with more varieties than one may\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\n_Variety 1._ BUTTER-MILK BUTTER.—This has not been well worked, and\r\nhas the taste of fresh buttermilk. It is not very disagreeable to such\r\nas love fresh buttermilk; but as it is a flavor not expected in good\r\nbutter, it is usually disagreeable.\r\n\r\n_Variety 2._ STRONG BUTTER.—This is one step farther along, and the\r\nbuttermilk is changing and beginning to assert its right to\r\npredominate over the butteraceous flavor; yet it may be eaten with\r\nsome pleasure if done rapidly, accompanied with very good bread.\r\n\r\n_Variety 3._ FROWY OR FROWSY BUTTER.—This is a second degree of\r\nstrength attained by the buttermilk. It has become pungent, and too\r\ndisagreeable for any but absent-minded eaters.\r\n\r\n_Variety 4._ RANCID BUTTER.—This is the putrescent stage. No\r\ndescription will convey, to those who have not tasted it, an idea of\r\nits unearthly flavor; while those who _have_, will hardly thank us for\r\nstirring up such awful remembrances by any description.\r\n\r\n_Variety 5._ BITTER BUTTER.—Bitterness is, for the most part, incident\r\nto winter-butter. When one has but little cream and is long in\r\ncollecting enough for the churn, he will be very apt to have bitter\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n_Variety 6._ MUSTY BUTTER.—In summer, especially in damp, unventilated\r\ncellars, cream will gather mold; Whenever this appears, the pigs\r\nshould be set to churn it. But instead, if but just touched, it is\r\nquickly churned; or, if much molded, it is slightly skimmed, as if the\r\n_flavor_ of mold, which has struck through the whole mass, could be\r\nremoved by taking off the colored portion! The peculiar taste arising\r\nfrom this affection of the milk, blessed be the man who needs to be\r\ntold it!\r\n\r\n_Variety 7._ SOUR-MILK BUTTER.—This is made from milk which has been\r\nallowed to sour, the milk and cream being churned up together. The\r\nflavor is that of greasy, sour milk.\r\n\r\n_Variety 8._ VINEGAR BUTTER.—There are some who imagine that all milk\r\nshould be _soured_ before it is fit to churn. When, in cool weather,\r\nit delays to change, they expedite the matter by some acid—usually\r\nvinegar. The butter strongly retains the flavor thereof.\r\n\r\n_Variety 9._ CHEESY BUTTER.—Cream comes quicker by being heated. If\r\nsour cream be heated, it is very apt to separate and deposit a _whey_:\r\nif this is strained into the churn with the cream, the butter will\r\nhave a strong cheesy flavor.\r\n\r\n_Variety 10._ GRANULATED BUTTER.—When, in winter, sweet cream is\r\nover-heated, preparatory to churning, it produces butter full of\r\n_grains_, as if there were meal in it.\r\n\r\n_Variety 11._—In this we will comprise the two opposite kinds—_too\r\nsalt_ and _unsalted butter_. We have seen butter exposed for sale with\r\nsuch masses of salt in it that one is tempted to believe that it was\r\nput in as a make-weight. When the salt is coarse, the operation of\r\neating this butter affords those who have good teeth, a pleasing\r\nvariety of grinding.\r\n\r\n_Variety 12._ LARD BUTTER.—When lard is cheap and abundant, and butter\r\nrather dear, it is thought profitable to combine the two.\r\n\r\n_Variety 13._ MIXED BUTTER.—When the shrewd housewife has several\r\nseparate churnings of butter on hand, some of which would hardly be\r\nable to go alone, she puts them together, and those who buy, find out\r\nthat “Union is _strength_!” Such butter is pleasingly marbled; dumps\r\nof white, of yellow, and of dingy butter melting into each other,\r\nuntil the whole is ring-streaked and speckled.\r\n\r\n_Variety 14._ COMPOUND BUTTER.—By compound butter we mean that which\r\nhas received contributions from things animate and inanimate;\r\nfeathers, hairs, rags of cloth, threads, specks, chips, straws, seeds;\r\nin short, everything is at one time or another to be found in it,\r\ngoing to produce the three successive degrees of dirty, filthy, nasty.\r\n\r\n_Variety 15._ TOUGH BUTTER.—When butter is worked too long after the\r\nexpulsion of buttermilk, it assumes a gluey, putty-like consistence,\r\nand is tough when eaten. But, oh blessed fault! we would go ten miles\r\nto pay our admiring respects to that much-to-be-praised dairy-maid\r\nwhose zeal leads her to work her butter too much! We doubt, however,\r\nif a pound of such butter was ever seen in this place.\r\n\r\nBesides all these, whose history we have correctly traced; besides\r\nbutter tasting of turpentine from being made in pine churns; butter\r\nbent on travelling, in hot weather; butter dotted, like cloves on a\r\nboiled ham, with flies, which Solomon assures us causeth the ointment\r\nto stink; besides butter in rusty tin pans, and in dirty swaddling\r\nclothes; besides butter made of milk drawn from a dirty cow, by a\r\ndirtier hand, into a yet dirtier pail, and churned in a churn the\r\ndirtiest of all; besides all these sub-varieties, there are several\r\nothers with which we have formed an acquaintance, but found ourselves\r\nbaffled at analysis. We could not even guess the cause of their\r\npeculiarities. Oh Dr. Liebig! how we have longed for your skill in\r\nanalytic chemistry! What consternation would we speedily send among\r\nthe slatternly butter-makers, revealing the mysteries of their dirty\r\ndoings with more than mesmeric facility!\r\n\r\nAnd now, what on earth is the reason that good butter is so great a\r\nrarity? Is it a hereditary curse in some families? or is it a\r\npunishment sent upon us for our ill-deserts? A few good butter-makers\r\nin every neighborhood are a standing proof that it is nothing but bad\r\nhousewifery; mere sheer carelessness which turns the luxury of the\r\nchurn into an utterly nauseating abomination.\r\n\r\nSelect cows for quality and not for quantity of milk; give them sweet\r\nand sufficient pasturage; keep clean yourself; milk into a clean pail;\r\nstrain into clean pans—(pans scalded, scoured, and sunned, and if tin,\r\nwith every particle of milk rubbed out of the seams.) While it is yet\r\nsweet, churn it; if it delays to come, add a little saleratus; work it\r\nthoroughly, three times, salting it at the second working; put it into\r\na cool place, and then, when, with a conscience as clean and sweet as\r\nyour butter, you have dispatched your tempting rolls to market, you\r\nmay sit down and thank God that you are an honest woman!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCINCINNATI, THE QUEEN CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the squealing celebrity of Porkopolis,\r\nCincinnati seems destined to merge the glory of that name in the more\r\nagreeable title, City of Vineyards. That she is the Queen City none\r\ndenies. But on account of what single excellence, it might be\r\ndifficult, for some, to say. A queen of slaughter-pens might he a\r\nhearty buxom lass, but, withal, not exactly the personage for which\r\nknights (Sancho always excepted) love to break lances. A queen of\r\nfoundries and stithies, she might be, and not necessarily, on that\r\naccount, a ruddy brunette; inasmuch as Sir Vulcan was, once before,\r\nthe husband of Venus—queen of beauty. A blushing queen of strawberry\r\nbeds would be quite romantic; but yet more appropriate if her\r\njurisdiction were extended over vines and purple clusters and\r\nvineyards and orchards. But whether it be pork, or iron, or gardens,\r\nor vineyards, or observatories, Cincinnati is acknowledged on all\r\nhands to be the Queen City.\r\n\r\nLeaving her commercial glories out of view, we think Cincinnati has\r\ndone more for horticulture than any American city, taking into the\r\naccount her recent origin and her means. In all other cities\r\nhorticulture has been the child of wealth and leisure. It has\r\n_followed_ commercial or manufacturing prosperity. But in this city,\r\nit began with them and kept pace with them; so that one wonders which\r\nmost to admire, the thrift of industry and skill, or the elegant taste\r\nwhich is so generally evinced in the cultivation of fruit, and shrub\r\nand flower.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the Transactions of the Cincinnati Horticultural\r\nSociety, is eminently worthy of that enterprising corporation.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts of several principal friends of horticulture seem much\r\ndirected to the subject of vine culture, and the manufacture of wine.\r\nThere are more than eighty-three vineyards in the vicinity of the city\r\ncontaining not far from 400 acres of land! From 114 acres during the\r\nseason of 1845, more than 23,000 gallons of wine were manufactured,\r\nand there was not more than half a crop obtained in that season. The\r\naverage yield of wine per acre, for five years in succession, is\r\nstated to be from 450 to 500 gallons per annum.\r\n\r\nMany think the culture of the grape will be the finishing stroke to\r\nthe temperance enterprise; affording a wholesome beverage from our\r\nhills in place of “corn juice” from our bottoms, and beer from our hop\r\nand barley fields.\r\n\r\nThe arguments urged by some with great sincerity, are the often-quoted\r\nfacts, that the inhabitants of wine-making countries are favorably\r\ndistinguished for temperance; and that a palatable and wholesome\r\nbeverage—pure wine—would supersede the use of violent liquors. If we\r\nthought that our people would become temperate upon such conditions,\r\nwe should be glad to see a vineyard on every hillside, and a wine-vat\r\nto every farmhouse. But there is no reason to expect any such result.\r\nVineyards in Europe exist among a quiet, comparatively unenterprising\r\npeasantry. They have been _trained_ to moderation; necessity has made\r\nthem temperate in all things—in food, in dress, in expense, and in\r\ndrink. The popular habits are not so excitable as with us; business\r\nruns in quiet streams, and politics are unknown. With us, business is\r\nboisterous, pleasure obstreperous, and politics outrageous. Our people\r\nare anything but quiet; they are hot, hot in tongue and blood. It is\r\nwide enough of the mark to suppose that the same cause existing among\r\ntwo entirely dissimilar people, would, of course, produce the same\r\nresults. We might as well say that vineyards would make our people eat\r\nless meat, less corn and pork, because the residents of wine districts\r\nwere known to be addicted to a vegetable diet. The probable\r\nconsequences of abundant cheap wine must be judged, not by what would\r\nhappen in France, among abstemious peasants, nor on the Rhine, among\r\neconomical and sober Germans; but by the tastes, habits, and\r\ntendencies of our own people. In this land everything tends to\r\nexcitement. Men live upon a higher key, and live faster and live much\r\nmore full of exhilaration than the same classes do in foreign lands.\r\nOur people drink not for the _taste_ but for the _excitement_ of\r\nliquor; and, so that wine, beer, or whisky will bring them up to the\r\nright key, the question of wholesomeness is quite unimportant. Our\r\npeople are free and therefore have a right to live in the violation of\r\nnatural laws; and a right, constantly exercised, of having fevers on\r\naccount of surfeitings, and of dying early and by thousands by reasons\r\nof gross excesses.\r\n\r\nPleasures and business are esteemed by the volume of blood which they\r\ncan drive, the pulse they can raise, the heat of excitement which they\r\ncan produce. So long as affairs are fresh and piquant they are\r\nstimulants enough. But in the inequalities and intervals and fatigues\r\nof life, something else is required to hold the spirits up to the high\r\nlevel upon which everything proceeds. As soon as a man resorts to\r\nalcoholic stimulants to do this, he has embarked upon a course where\r\nall experience shows that he will drink deeper and deeper to final\r\ndownright intemperance.\r\n\r\nSome people think that cheap and wholesome beverage for the “masses,”\r\nfor laboring people, is desirable. While it may be well enough for\r\nevery gentleman of leisure, it is to be the poor man’s special\r\nblessing, saving him from the swill of the brewery and the fire of the\r\nstill. Facts will stand on the side of the reverse reasoning. If wine\r\nis to be harmless at all, it will be with men who are not prone to\r\nenterprising heats; but given to the relishful pleasure of sipping\r\njust for the delicate flavors, for the aroma, for the fine _bouquet_\r\nof wine—men who need to have their blood up, and kept up, and resort\r\nto wine to supply the flagging stimulus of affairs; such men will not\r\ndrink for the flavor, but for the feeling.\r\n\r\nIt is for the sake of being roused; it is to be stimulated; it is, in\r\nplain language, to have the first exhilarations of drunkenness that\r\nlaboring men drink, will drink, and have always drank cider, beer,\r\nwine, and brandy. The result of affording wine in abundance to such\r\npeople as ours, will be to prepare them for a stronger drink just as\r\nsoon as wine, by frequent use, is no longer stimulating enough. Wine\r\nwill play jackal to brandy for the rich, and to whisky for the poor.\r\nWe have some facts on hand touching this popular wine-drinking, which,\r\nif necessary, we shall employ at another time. Meanwhile, we are glad\r\nto see grape-culture spreading for the production of table-grapes; for\r\nthe manufacture of wine, in so far as a supply of pure wine is needed\r\nfor medicinal purposes. Further than that, we are opposed to\r\nwine-making. And as to cheating whisky out of its authority over “the\r\ndear people” by the blandishments of hock and champagne, or redeeming\r\nour barley and cornfields from the abominable persecutions of the\r\nbrew-tub and the still, by the conservative energy or evangelizations\r\nof grape juice, we shall believe it when we see it; and we shall just\r\nas soon expect to see fire putting out fire and frost melting ice, as\r\none degree of alcoholic stimulus curing a higher one.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE GARDEN STICKS.—It is desirable when one has prepared good\r\nsticks for supporting carnations, roses, dahlias, etc., to preserve\r\nthem from year to year. The following preparation will make them last\r\na man’s lifetime: When they are freshly made, allow them to become\r\nthoroughly dry; then soak them in linseed oil for some time, say two\r\nor three days. When taken out let them stand to dry till the oil is\r\nperfectly soaked in; then paint with two coats of verdigris paint. No\r\nwet can then penetrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF ANIMALS IN WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wisest man has said that “the righteous man regardeth the life of\r\nhis beast; but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.” If any one\r\nis at a loss to know the meaning of the latter part, he cannot have\r\nmade good use of his eyes. Lean cattle, leaner horses, anatomical\r\nspecimens of cows, half fed, dirty, drenched by every rain, and\r\npierced by every-winter wind, these are an excellent comment on the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nIt is time for every merciful man to make provision for every dumb\r\nanimal which is dependent upon him.\r\n\r\n_Cows_ should be provided with a comfortable stable at night. No\r\nfeeding will be a substitute for good shelter. Both the quantity and\r\nquality of the milk will depend upon bodily comfort in respect to\r\nwarmth and nutritious food. Such as are becoming heavy with calf\r\nshould be specially cared for. Many farmers let their cows shift for\r\nthemselves as soon as their milk dries away. But the health of the\r\ncoming calf and the ability of the cow to supply it, and her owner,\r\ncopiously with milk depend on the condition in which she is kept\r\nduring the period of gestation.\r\n\r\n_Cattle_ should have a good shed provided for them, under which they\r\nmay be dry and sheltered from winds. It is the curse of western\r\nfarming that cattle and fodder are so plenty that it is hardly a loss\r\nto waste both.\r\n\r\nWhere the amount of stock is too great for comfortable home-quarters,\r\nand they are wintered in a stock field, there should be places of\r\nresort for them, so high as to remain dry, well turfed with\r\nblue-grass, and sheltered with cheap sheds, or by belts of forest.\r\n\r\n_Sheep_ should receive special attention. They abhor wet. They should\r\nbe permitted to keep their fleece dry, and to eat their food in a dry\r\nstable. The flock should be sorted. The bucks and wethers by\r\nthemselves, the ewes by themselves; lambs and weak sheep in another\r\ndivision; and a fourth compartment should never be wanting for the\r\nsick, where they may be nursed and medically treated.\r\n\r\n_Horses_ are more apt to be taken care of than cattle. But even they\r\nare often more indebted for existence to a stubborn tenacity of life,\r\nthan to the care of their keepers. The horse is a more dainty feeder\r\nthan ruminating animals. He should be supplied with a better article\r\nof hay: his grain should never be dirty or musty.\r\n\r\nHardy farm-horses may even rough out the winter without blanketing or\r\nany other care than is necessary to supply good food and enough of\r\nit. But carriage horses, and those highly prized for the\r\nsaddle—aristocratic horses—should be more carefully groomed. It is not\r\nwise to blanket a horse at all, unless it can be _always_ done. If he\r\nis liable to change hands; to be off on journeys under circumstances\r\nin which he cannot be blanketed at night, it will be better not to\r\nbegin it.\r\n\r\nWinter is a good time to kill off spirited horses. They are easily run\r\ndown by a smashing sleigh-ride pace. Boys and girls, buzzing in a\r\ndouble sleigh like a hive of bees, think that the horses enjoy\r\nthemselves, at the exhilarating pace of six or eight miles an hour, as\r\nmuch as _they_ do. But this is not ordinarily the worst of it. The\r\nhorse stands out, after a trip of ten or fifteen miles, at a post for\r\nan hour or two until thoroughly chilled; then home he races, and goes\r\ninto the stable, steaming with sweat, to stand without blankets all\r\nnight. Horses catch cold as much as men do. And a horse-cold is just\r\nas bad as a human cold. As there has been some difficulty, in the\r\nconstruction of fanning mills, to gain a strong enough current of\r\nwind, we would advise the builders of them to study the construction\r\nof a good stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER NIGHTS FOR READING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the winter is a season of comparative leisure, it is the time for\r\nfarmers to study. It is a good time for them to make themselves\r\nacquainted with the nature of soils, of manures, of vegetable\r\norganization—or structural botany. Farmers are liable to rely wholly\r\nupon their own experience, and to despise science. Book-men are apt to\r\nrely on scientific theories, and nothing upon practice. If these two\r\ntendencies would only court and marry each other, what a hopeful\r\nfamily would they rear! How nice it would look to see in the papers:\r\n\r\nMARRIED.—By Philosophical Wisdom, Esq., Mr. Practical Experience, to\r\nMiss Sober Science. [We will stand godfather to all the children.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quality of feathers depends on their strength, elasticity and\r\ncleanness; and these, again, depend upon the condition of the bird,\r\nits health, food, and the time of plucking its feathers. _Down_ is the\r\nterm applied to under-feathers—most abundant in water fowl, and in\r\nthose especially which live in cold latitudes, being designed to\r\nprotect them from wet and cold. The eider-down, from the eider-duck,\r\nis of the most repute. It is brought from extreme northern latitudes,\r\nand is used for coverings to beds, rather than for beds themselves,\r\nas, by being slept upon, it loses its elasticity.\r\n\r\n_Poultry feathers_, as those of turkeys, ducks, and chickens, if\r\nassorted and the coarse ones rejected, afford very good beds; but they\r\nare not so elastic as geese-feathers.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that live geese-feathers are _the_ best. Every one\r\ndoes not think of the reason; which, as it is the key to the art of\r\nhaving good feathers, we shall propound.\r\n\r\nSo long as a bird is alive, the feathers are as much an object of\r\nnutrition as the flesh, the bones, or any other part of the body.\r\n\r\nWhen dead, put them into hot water to make the feathers come easy. In\r\npulling, take out large handfuls at a time, so as to have scraps of\r\nmeat and shreds of skin adhere to the quill; let them lie for several\r\ndays in wet heaps to ferment a little. Then dry them suddenly by\r\nviolent heat, cram them into the bed-tick, and jump on, and if you\r\nhave not an odorous bed, and, in a month or two, a bedful of visitors\r\nseeking food, then there is no truth in the laws of nature.\r\n\r\n_The care of beds_ is not understood, often, by even good housewives.\r\nWhen a bed is freshly made it often smells strong. Constant airing,\r\nwill, if the feathers are good, and only new, remove the scent.\r\n\r\nA bed in constant use should be invariably beaten and shaken up daily,\r\nto enable the feathers to retain their elasticity.\r\n\r\nIt should lie after it is shaken up, for two or three hours a day, in\r\na well ventilated room. The human body is constantly giving off a\r\nperspiration; and at night more than usual, from the relaxed condition\r\nof the skin. The bed will become foul from this cause if not well\r\naired. If the bed is in a room which cannot be spared for such a\r\nlength of time, it should be put out to air two full days in the week.\r\n\r\nIn airing beds, _the sun should never shine directly upon them_. It is\r\n_air_, not _heat_, that they need. We have seen beds lying on a roof\r\nwhere the direct and reflected rays of the sun had full power, and the\r\nfeathers, without doubt, were _stewing_, and the oil in the quill\r\nbecoming rancid; so that the bed smells worse after its roasting than\r\nbefore. _Always air beds in the shade, and, if possible, in cool and\r\nwindy days._ And now, if any of our attentive housewife-readers, and\r\nwe have not a few, are disposed to reward us for all this advice, let\r\nthem give us a bed to sleep on, when we next visit them, made of\r\ngrowing feathers, from live and healthy geese, carefully picked, well\r\ncured, daily shaken up and thoroughly aired; and if we do not dream\r\nthat the owner is an angel, it will be because we are too much\r\noccupied in sound sleeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAIL UP YOUR BUGS.\r\n\r\n  “The words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by masters\r\n   of assemblies.”—SOLOMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a great pother about canker worms, peach-tree worms, and other\r\naudacious robber-worms; after smoke, salt, tar, and tansy, bands of\r\nwool, cups of oil, lime, ashes, and surgery have been set forth as\r\nremedies, to the confusion of those who have tried them bootlessly, it\r\nnow appears that we are about to _nail_ the rascals. The Boston\r\n_Cultivator_, contains an article “On Destroying Insects on Trees,”\r\nfrom which we quote:\r\n\r\n     “I did not intend to give it publicity until I had fully\r\n     tested it, but as the ravages are very extensive in the\r\n     West, I cannot delay giving you the experiment, hoping that\r\n     some of your western readers may now give it a fair trial\r\n     and report the result. I will give one case which may induce\r\n     the experiment wherever the evil is felt. In conversation\r\n     with a friend in Newburyport, Dr. Watson, last fall. I\r\n     mentioned the experiment; he invited me to his garden, where\r\n     last year a fruit-tree was infested with the nests of\r\n     caterpillar or canker-worms, as were his neighbors’ trees;\r\n     he showed me a board nailed for convenience of a\r\n     clothes-line upon one of the large limbs of the tree; he\r\n     said he noticed a little while afterward that the nests on\r\n     that limb dried up, and the worms disappeared, though the\r\n     cause did not then occur to him though apparent as it will\r\n     be to any scientific mind.\r\n\r\n     “Drive carefully well home, so that the bark will heal over\r\n     a few headless cast iron nails, say some six or eight, size\r\n     and number according to the size of the tree, in a ring\r\n     around its body, a foot or two above the ground. The\r\n     oxidation of the iron by the sap, will evolve ammonia, which\r\n     will, of course, with the rising sap, impregnate every part\r\n     of the foliage, and prove to the delicate palate of the\r\n     patient, a nostrum, which will soon become, as in many cases\r\n     of larger animals, the real panacea for the ills of life,\r\n     _via Tomb_. I think if the ladies should drive some small\r\n     iron brads into some limbs of any plant infested with any\r\n     insect, they would find it a good and safe remedy, and I\r\n     imagine in any case, instead of injury, the ammonia will be\r\n     found particularly invigorating. Let it be tried upon a limb\r\n     of any tree, where there is a vigorous nest of caterpillars,\r\n     and watch it for a week or ten days, and I think the result\r\n     will pay for the nails.”\r\n\r\nLet our farmers take their hammers and nails and start for the\r\norchard; if they see a bug on the tree, drive a nail, and he is a bug\r\nno more! If they see a worm, in with a nail, and the “ammonia evolved”\r\nwill finish his functions!\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Planter_ is out with a backer to the Boston\r\n_Cultivator_:\r\n\r\n     “A singular fact, and one worthy of being recorded, was\r\n     mentioned to us a few days since by Mr. Alexander Duke, of\r\n     Albemarle. He stated that whilst on a visit to a neighbor,\r\n     his attention was called to a large peach orchard, every\r\n     tree in which had been totally destroyed by the ravages of\r\n     the worm, with the exception of three, and these three were\r\n     probably the most thrifty and flourishing peach-trees he\r\n     ever saw. The only cause of their superiority known to his\r\n     host, was an experiment made in consequence of observing\r\n     that those parts of worm-eaten timber into which nails had\r\n     been driven, were generally sound; when his trees were about\r\n     a year old he had selected three of them and driven a\r\n     tenpenny nail through the body, as near the ground as\r\n     possible; whilst the balance of his orchard has gradually\r\n     failed, and finally yielded entirely to the ravages of the\r\n     worms, these three trees, selected at random, treated\r\n     precisely in the same manner, with the exception of the\r\n     nailing, had always been vigorous and healthy, furnishing\r\n     him at that very period with the greatest profusion of the\r\n     most luscious fruit. It is supposed that the salts of iron\r\n     afforded by the nail are offensive to the worm, whilst they\r\n     are harmless, or perhaps even beneficial to the tree.”\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to interrupt any experiments which the enterprising may\r\nchoose to make. To be sure we regard the facts with some incredulity,\r\nand the chemical explanations with something of the mirthful\r\nsuperadded to unbelief. But if nails _are_ an antidote to worms—a real\r\nvermifuge—let them be administered, whatever may be the explanations;\r\nwhether they are an electric battery, giving the insects a little\r\ndomestic, vegetable lightning, or whether they afford “salts of iron”\r\nto physic them, or “evolve ammonia” in such potent, pungent strength\r\nthat vermicular nostrils are unable to endure it!\r\n\r\nWhile one is fairly engaged in a campaign of experiments, we heartily\r\nhope that war will be carried to the very territory of ignorance, and\r\nwe will propound several other important questions of fact and theory,\r\nwhich, if settled, will crown somebody’s brow with laurels.\r\n\r\nIt is said that hanging a scythe in a plum-tree, or an iron hoop, or\r\nhorse shoes, will insure a crop of plums. This ought to be\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nIt is said that pear-trees that are unfruitful, may be made to bear,\r\nby digging under them, cutting the tap root, and burying a black cat\r\nthere. We do not know as it makes any difference as to the sex of the\r\ncat, though we should, if trying it, rather prefer the male cat.\r\n\r\nLastly, that we may contribute our mite to the advancement of science,\r\nwe will state that, in our youth, we were informed, that, if we would\r\ngo into the wood-house once a day and rub our hands with a chip,\r\n_without thinking of red fox’s tail_, the warts would all go off. We\r\nhave no doubt that it would have been successful, but every time we\r\ntried the experiment, whisk came the red fox’s tail into our head and\r\nspoilt the whole affair. But might this not cure warts on trees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASHES AND THEIR USE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome soils contain already the chemical ingredients which wood ashes\r\nsupply. If lime be applied to a calcareous soil, it will do no good;\r\nthere was no want of lime there before; if potash be added to a soil\r\nalready abounding in it, no effect will be seen in the crops. Ashes\r\ncontain lime and potash (phosphate of lime and silicate of potash). If\r\na soil is naturally rich in these, the addition of ashes would be\r\nuseless. Such cases show the true benefits of a _really_ scientific\r\nknowledge of soils and manures. Every plant that grows takes out of\r\nthe soil certain qualities. Wheat, among other things, extracts\r\nlargely of its potash; Indian corn abstracts but little; potatoes\r\nextract phosphate of magnesia, etc. A chemist would say, at once,\r\napply that kind of manure which is rich in the peculiar property\r\nextracted by your wheat, corn, or potatoes! What manure is that? Here\r\nagain science must help. It analyzes manures—gives the farmer the\r\nchoice among them. The soil being known, the properties required by\r\ndifferent crops being known—the farmer applies that manure which\r\ncontains what the soil lacks. Experiments have seemed to show, that,\r\nfor purposes of tillage, _leached_ ashes are just as good as the\r\n_unleached_. So that housewives may have all the use of their ashes\r\nfor soap, and then employ them in the garden. Leached ashes become\r\nbetter by being exposed for some time in the air absorbing from the\r\natmosphere fertilizing qualities (carbonic acid?)\r\n\r\nSo valuable are ashes regarded in Europe, that they are frequently\r\nhauled by farmers from twenty miles’ distance—and on Long Island they\r\nbring eight cents a bushel.\r\n\r\nThe ashes of different kinds of wood are of very unequal value—that of\r\nthe oak the least, and that of beech the most valuable. The latter\r\nwood constitutes two-thirds of the fire-wood of this region, and the\r\nashes are therefore the very best.\r\n\r\nA coat of ashes may be laid, in the spring, over the whole garden and\r\nspaded in with the barnyard manure.\r\n\r\nThey may be dug in about gooseberry and currant bushes.\r\n\r\nThey are excellent about the trunks of fruit-trees, spreading the old\r\neach year, and renewing the deposit.\r\n\r\nThey may be thinly spread over the grass-plat in the dooryard, as they\r\nwill give vigor and deeper color and strength to the grass.\r\n\r\nWe have usually added about one shovelful of ashes to every _twenty_\r\nin making a compost for flowers, roses, shrubs, etc.\r\n\r\nAshes are peculiarly good for all kinds of melon, squash, and cucumber\r\nvines. This is well known to those who raise watermelons on burnt\r\nfields, on old charcoal pits, etc. We have seen statements of\r\ncucumbers being planted upon a peck of pure, leached ashes, in a hole\r\nin the ground, and thriving with great vigor. The ashes of vines show\r\na great amount of potash; and as wood ashes afford this substance\r\nabundantly, its use would seem to be indicated by theory as well as\r\nconfirmed by experiment.\r\n\r\nLastly, whenever ground is liable to suffer severely from drought, we\r\nwould advise a liberal use of ashes and salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARD TIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are called _hard times_ produce very different effects on\r\ndifferent individuals. Some are made more industrious, and some more\r\nindolent; some grow frugal and careful, others careless and desperate;\r\nsome never appear so honest as when brought to the _pinch_, but many\r\nmen seem honest _until_ they are brought to the trial, and then give\r\nway. Hard times are gradually passing away. As a community, are we\r\nbetter or worse off than before? A few particulars may help us to form\r\nsome judgment.\r\n\r\nFewer goods are bought at the store, and more are manufactured at\r\nhome; spinning-wheels and looms have renewed their youth—and so have\r\nour mothers, who, after a long disuse, may now be seen working as\r\nmerrily at them, as they used to do when they spun and wove their\r\n_wedding_ furnishings—although they have not now any such rosy hope to\r\nquicken their aged fingers. Men have been obliged to rely more upon\r\ntheir own ingenuity—for want of money to pay the carpenter, the\r\nblacksmith, the shoe-maker, etc. Old clothes, old tools have been made\r\nto serve an additional campaign.\r\n\r\nThe leisure of dull times has been improved extensively in setting out\r\norchards, and we hope this practice will be continued in busy times.\r\nNo one has, during the _pressure_, suffered for food, raiment, or\r\nshelter. Indeed, it is supposed that not a pound less of sugar, tea\r\nand coffee, has been used by the farmers than hitherto. Probably the\r\nquantity has increased.\r\n\r\nDebts have been gradually contracted or discharged. Men have seen the\r\nend of speculations to be sudden disaster—and (of all things on earth)\r\nspeculation-farming has received its reward. Men contented with small\r\ngains—industrious, frugal, and prudent men have suffered almost\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYPSUM.—“Time and practice” have ascertained the circumstances under\r\nwhich gypsum should be applied. As a reason why, after repeated\r\napplications, it no longer benefits, Prof. Liebig says, “when we\r\nincrease the crop of hay in a meadow by means of gypsum, we remove a\r\ngreater quantity of potash with the hay, than can, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, be restored. Hence it happens that, after the lapse of\r\nseveral years, the crops of grass on lands manured with gypsum,\r\ndiminish, owing to the deficiency of potash.” In such a case, if spent\r\nashes were employed either in connection or alternately with\r\ngypsum—potash would be resupplied from the ashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCLIMATING A PLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other day we were riding past a large farm, and were much\r\ngratified at a device of the owner for the preservation of his tools.\r\nA good plow, apparently new in the spring, had been left in one corner\r\nof the field, standing in the furrow, just where, four months before,\r\nthe boy had finished his _stint_. Probably the timber needed\r\n_seasoning_—it was certainly getting it. Perhaps it was left out for\r\nacclimation. May-be the farmer left it there to save time in the hurry\r\nof the spring-work, in dragging it from the shed. Perhaps he covered\r\nthe share to keep it from the elements, and save it from rusting. Or,\r\nagain, perhaps he is troubled with neighbors that _borrow_, and had\r\nleft it where it would be convenient for them. He might, at least,\r\nhave built a little shed over it. Can any one tell what a farmer\r\nleaves a plow out a whole season for? It is barely possible that he\r\nwas an _Irishman_, and had _planted_ for a spring crop of plows.\r\n\r\nAfter we got to sleep that night, we dreamed a dream. We went into\r\nthat man’s barn; boards were kicked off, partitions were half broken\r\ndown, racks broken, floor a foot deep with manure, hay trampled under\r\nfoot and wasted, grain squandered. The wagon had not been hauled under\r\nthe shed, though it was raining. The harness was scattered about—hames\r\nin one place, the breeching in another—the lines were used for\r\n_halters_. We went to the house. A shed stood hard by, in which a\r\nfamily wagon was kept for wife and daughters to go to town in. The\r\nhens had appropriated it as a roost, and however plain it was _once_,\r\nit was ornamented _now_, inside and out. (Here, by the way, let it be\r\nremembered that hen-dung is the _best_ manure for melons, squashes,\r\ncucumbers, etc.) We peeped into the smoke-house, but of all the\r\n“fixings” that we ever saw! A Chinese Museum is nothing to it. Onions,\r\nsoap-grease, squashes, hogs’ bristles, soap, old iron, kettles, a\r\nbroken spinning-wheel, a churn, a grindstone, bacon, hams, washing\r\ntubs, a barrel of salt, bones with the meat half cut off, scraps of\r\nleather, dirty bags, a chest of Indian meal, old boots, smoked\r\nsausages, the ashes and brands that remained since the last “smoke,”\r\nstumps of brooms, half a barrel of rotten apples, together with rats,\r\nbacon bugs, earwigs, sowbugs, and other vermin which collect in damp\r\ndirt. We started for the house; the window near the door had twelve\r\nlights, two of wood, two of hats, four of paper, one of a bunch of\r\nrags, one of a pillow, and the _rest_ of glass. Under it stood several\r\ncooking pots, and several that were _not_ for cooking. As we were\r\nmeditating whether to enter, such a squall arose from a quarrelling\r\nman and woman, that we awoke—and lo! it was a dream. So that the man\r\nwho left his plow out all the season, may live in the neatest house in\r\nthe county, for all that we know; only, was it not strange that we\r\nshould have dreamed all this from just seeing a plow left out in the\r\nfurrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOUR YOUR PLOWS BRIGHT!\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers may be surprised to know that their crops will depend a good\r\ndeal on the color of the plows! yet so it is. Bright plows are found\r\nto produce much better crops than any other. It may be electricity, or\r\nmagic for aught we know; we merely state the fact, leaving others to\r\naccount for it. But very much depends upon the manner of doing it, for\r\nmerely scrubbing it by hand with emery or sand is not the thing—_it\r\nmust be scoured by the soil_. It is found that the subsoil scours it\r\nbetter for wheat, than the top soil—for a plow kept bright by very\r\ndeep plowing affords better wheat than a plow brightened by the\r\nsurface of the soil. It is the same with corn. In respect to this last\r\ncrop, if you will keep your plow bright as a mirror until the corn is\r\nin the milk, you will find that it will have a wonderful effect. We\r\nappeal to every good farmer if he ever knew a rusty plow to be\r\naccompanied with good crops? Iron rust on a plow-share is poisonous to\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nA young farmer of about twenty years of age said to us the other day:\r\n“If anybody wants me, he must come to my corn-field; I live there—I am\r\nat it all the time—I have harrowed my corn once, plowed five times,\r\nand gone over it with the hoe once.” “Yes,” said his old father, who\r\nseemed, justly, quite proud of his son—“keep your plows agoing if you\r\nwant to fetch corn. I never let the ground settle on the top; if it is\r\nbeaten down by rain, or begins to look a kind of rusty on the surface,\r\nI pitch into it, and keep it as mealy as flour. The fact is our\r\nfarmers raise more corn than they can tend, they can’t go over the\r\ncorn more than once or twice, and that’ll never do, and I guess I’ll\r\nshow old Billy R—— that it’s so.”\r\n\r\nSome ambitious farmers are pleased to “lay by” the corn very early;\r\nbut it is not wise; for the grass is always more forward to grow about\r\nthis season than any other; and the ground will become very foul where\r\ncorn is too early laid by, and, what is more to the purpose, a great\r\ndeal of the nourishment of a crop is derived from the air and dew\r\n_conveyed to the roots_. This can be done only when the surface is\r\nkept thoroughly open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOW TILL IT IS DRY, AND PLOW TILL IT IS WET.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of corn, a very intelligent gentleman remarked: “Well, by a\r\nfive minutes’ talk, I made Mr. —— produce the best crop he ever had on\r\na certain field.” He was looking over the fence where his corn was, at\r\na flat field, upon furrows full of water; as I came by he said: “Well,\r\nI shall never get a crop off this piece of land; it’s going just as it\r\nalways does when I plant here.” I told him of an old man in Indiana,\r\nwho was a good farmer, to whom I once said when at his house one\r\nmorning:\r\n\r\n“Deafenbaugh, how is it that you always have good corn when no one\r\nelse gets a half crop?”\r\n\r\n“_Why_,” said he, “_when it is wet I plow it till it is dry, and when\r\nit is dry I plow it till it is wet_.”\r\n\r\nThe man to whom I told this anecdote, says our informant, tried the\r\npractice, and gained a fine crop.\r\n\r\nNow the principle is _good_. Our Dutch friend would not, we suppose,\r\nplow a stiff _clay_ in a wet condition, unless, possibly, to strike a\r\nchannel through the middle between rows. But the gist of the story\r\nlies in this—_constant cultivation_. Stir, _stir_, STIR the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIRRING THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to deep plowing we should urge the advantage of continually\r\nstirring the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nIT PRODUCES CLEANLINESS.—Weeds in a growing crop are witnesses which\r\nno good farmer can afford to have testifying against him. When seed is\r\nsown broad-cast, weeding cannot be performed. In Europe, where labor\r\nis cheap and children plenty, acres of wheat and such-like crops are\r\nweeded by hand. _Our_ only chance is to clear out every field, to be\r\nsown broad-cast, by a thorough previous culture. In all crops which\r\nare drilled, or planted in rows, the hoe, or plow, or cultivator,\r\nshould be kept in lively use through the season. This practice should\r\nbegin early, that weeds and grass may not get a start, for often, if\r\nthey do, it is nearly impossible to keep them down, especially if the\r\nseason is a wet one.\r\n\r\nBut there are yet some important reasons for constantly stirring the\r\nsoil among growing crops. No matter how thoroughly the earth was\r\npulverized when the seed was put in, one or two rains will, except in\r\nvery sandy loam, beat it down compactly. This crust is injurious in\r\npreventing the ingress of moisture. But that which is the most\r\nmaterial of all is, that _it excludes the air_. It is well known that\r\nthe air affords much nourishment to vegetation; but, perhaps, it is\r\nnot as well known, that it supplies it _by the root_ as well as by the\r\nleaf. If any one wishes to try the experiment, and we have done it\r\ntime and again, let two patches in a garden be treated in all respects\r\nalike, except in this—let one be hoed or raked _every two or three\r\ndays_ and the other not at all, or but once in the season.\r\n\r\nThe result will satisfy any man better than a paper argument. Indeed,\r\nwe have found it impossible (in a garden) to perfect some vegetables\r\nwithout constantly stirring the soil.\r\n\r\nWhile these advantages are gained, it is not to be forgotten that, in\r\ndry seasons, a thorough pulverization of the surface, will prevent the\r\nevaporation of the moisture _in the earth_ and prevent deleterious\r\neffects of the drought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSOIL PLOWING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the great improvements of the age is the adoption in husbandry\r\nof the subsoil plow; or, as it is called in England, _Deanstonizing\r\nsystem_, from Mr. Smith, of _Deanstone_, who first brought the\r\nimplement into general notice. They are designed to follow in the\r\nfurrow of a common plow, and pulverize without bringing up the soil\r\nfor eight or ten inches deeper. In ordinary soils two yoke of oxen\r\nwill work it with ease, plowing from an acre to an acre and a quarter\r\na day.\r\n\r\nThe use of this plow will renovate old bottom-lands, the surface of\r\nwhich has been exhausted by shallow plowing and continual cropping. It\r\nbrings up from below fresh material, which the atmosphere speedily\r\nprepares for crops.\r\n\r\nOld fields, a long time in grass, are very much benefited.\r\n\r\nConstant plowing at about the same depth will often form a hard\r\nunder-floor by the action of the plow, through which neither roots nor\r\nrain can well penetrate; subsoiling will relieve a field thus\r\nconditioned.\r\n\r\nSoils lying upon clay or hard compact gravel are opened and remarkably\r\nimproved by the process. The wet, level, beech-lands would be greatly\r\nbenefited by deep plowing in the _fall of the year_, subjecting the\r\nearth, to a considerable depth, to the action of the frosts, rains,\r\netc., and giving a downward drain for superfluous moisture.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have incidentally alluded to the benefits of subsoiling,\r\nthey deserve a separate and individual enumeration.\r\n\r\n1. In very deep molds or loams it brings up a supply of soil which has\r\nnot been exhausted by the roots.\r\n\r\n2. In soils whose fertility is dependent upon the constant\r\ndecomposition of mineral substances, subsoil plowing is advantageous\r\nby bringing up the disintegrated particles of rock, and exposing them\r\nto a more rapid change by contact with atmospheric agents.\r\n\r\n3. Subsoiling guards both against too much and too little moisture in\r\nthe soil. If there is more water than the soil can absorb, it sinks\r\nthrough the pulverized under-soil. If summer droughts exhaust the\r\nmoisture of the surface they cannot reach the subsoil, which affords\r\nabundant pasture to the roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE-BLIGHT AND WINTER KILLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are two entirely different processes. The _Fire Blight_ (of the\r\nmiddle and western States), is a disease of the circulatory system,\r\ninduced by a freezing of the sap while _the tree is in a growing and\r\nexcitable state_. It always _must_ occur before the leaves are shed in\r\nthe autumn. Winter-killing is of two kinds—resulting from severe cold,\r\nand from untimely heat. The loss of tender shrubs, roses, etc., at\r\nleast, before they are fully established, and of half-hardy\r\nfruit-trees, is occasioned by the winter sun shining warmly upon them\r\nwhile frozen, and suddenly thawing them. The point of death is usually\r\nnear the surface of the ground, where the under-ground bark and upper\r\nbark come together. Whole orchards are destroyed in this way; and, if\r\nexamined, the bark may be found _sprung off_ from the wood. This may\r\noccur at any time during the winter.\r\n\r\nWe are in doubt whether the winter-stored sap exists in a state to be\r\naffected by the expansion of the freezing fluids of the tree. If the\r\nexpansion of congelation _did_ produce the effect, it should have been\r\nmore _general_, for there are fluids in every part of the trunk—all\r\ncongeal or expand—and the bursting of the trunk in one place would not\r\nrelieve the contiguous portions. We should expect, if this were the\r\ncause, that the tree would _explode_, rather than split. Capt. Bach,\r\nwhen wintering near Great Slave Lake, about 63° north latitude,\r\nexperienced a cold of 70° below zero. Nor could any fire raise it _in\r\nthe house_ more than 12° above zero. Mathematical instrument cases,\r\nand boxes of seasoned fir, split in pieces by the cold. Could it have\r\nbeen the sap in _seasoned fir wood_ which split them by its expansion\r\nin congealing?\r\n\r\nWe quote a paragraph from Loudon—“The history of frosts furnishes very\r\nextraordinary facts. The trees are often scorched and burnt up, as\r\nwith the most excessive heat, in consequence of the separation of the\r\nwater from the air, which is therefore very drying. In the great frost\r\nin 1683, the trunks of oak, ash, walnut, and other trees, were\r\nmiserably split and cleft, so that they might be seen through, and the\r\ncracks often attended with dreadful noises like the explosion of\r\nfire-arms.”\r\n\r\nWe don’t exactly know whether to take the first part as Loudon’s\r\nexplanation of the facts in the second.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the nature of the summer’s growth, very\r\nmuch determines the power of a tree to resist the severity of winter.\r\nWhen there is but an imperfect ripening in a cold and backward season,\r\nthe tissues formed will be feeble, and the juices stored in them thin.\r\nNow the power to resist cold, among other things, is in proportion to\r\nthe viscidity of the fluids in a plant.\r\n\r\nIt is highly desirable that the chemical researches which have\r\nrevolutionized the art of cultivation, should be pushed into the\r\n_morbid anatomy_ of vegetation. A close, exact analysis of all the\r\nsubstances in an injured condition, will save a vast deal of bootless\r\ningenuity and fanciful speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER TALK.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not be tempted by fine weather to haul out manure—it will be half\r\nwasted by lying in small heaps over the field; to spread it will be\r\nworse yet; manure should lie in a stack, as little exposed to the\r\nweather as possible.\r\n\r\nLook to your fences; see that they are in complete order and leave\r\nnothing of this to consume your time in the spring when you will need\r\nall your force for other work. It is well to haul all the rails you\r\nwill need for the year. The timber will last longer cut now. Do not\r\nleave rails or sticks of timber lying where you cleave them, on the\r\ndamp ground, they will decay more in six months there, than in\r\neighteen when properly cared for. Put two rails down and lay the rest\r\nacross them so as to have a circulation of air beneath. If you have\r\nfive or ten acres of _deadening_ which you mean to clear up and put to\r\ncorn, you may as well roll the logs now. Every good farmer should\r\nstudy through the winter to make his spring work as light as possible.\r\nWhatever can be done _now_ do not fail to do it; you will have enough\r\nto do when spring opens; and perhaps the season may be one which will\r\ncrowd your work into a week or two. If you have young fruit-trees, or\r\na little home-nursery, look out for _rabbits_. They usually depredate\r\njust after a light fall of snow.\r\n\r\nOverhaul all your plows, carts, shovels, hoes, etc., and put\r\neverything in complete readiness.\r\n\r\nWhile you are moving about and repairing holes in the fence, putting\r\non a rail here, a stake yonder, a rider in another place, you may\r\ninquire of yourself whether your _character_ is not in some need of\r\nrepairs? Perhaps you are very careless and extravagant—the fence needs\r\nrails there; perhaps you are lazy—in that case the fence corners may\r\nbe said to be full of brambles and weeds, and must be cleared out;\r\nperhaps you are a violent, passionate man—you need a stake and rider\r\non that spot. And lastly, perhaps you are not _temperate_, if so, your\r\nfence is all going down and will soon have gaps enough to let in all\r\nthe hogs of indolence, vice, and crime: and they make a large drove\r\nand fatten fast. Now is a good time to plan how to get out of debt.\r\nDon’t be ashamed to _save_ in _little things_, nor to earn small\r\ngains: “_Many a mickle makes a muckle._” But set it down, to begin\r\nwith, that no saving is made by cheating yourself out of a good\r\nnewspaper. No man reads a good paper a year, without _saving_ by it.\r\nSuppose you put in your wheat a little better for something you see\r\nwritten by a good farmer and get five bushels more to the acre. One\r\nacre pays for a year’s paper. One recipe, a hint which betters any\r\ncrop, pays for the paper fourfold. Intelligent boys work better, plan\r\nbetter, earn and save better; and reading a good paper makes them\r\nintelligent. Besides, suppose you took a good paper a year, and found\r\nnothing new during all that time (an incredible supposition!) yet\r\nevery two weeks it comes to _jog your memory_ about things which you\r\nmay forget, but ought not to forget. It steps in and asks whether that\r\nlittle store bill is paid? Whether that loan drawing a fatal _six_,\r\n_seven_ or _ten per cent_ (poison! poison! deadly poison!) is being\r\nmelted down? whether the children are going to school? whether the\r\ntools are all right? the fences snug? whether economy, and industry,\r\nand sound morals (the best crop one can put in), are flourishing? It\r\nwill look at your orchard—peep over into your garden, pry into the\r\ndairy—nay, into the cupboard and bureau, and even into your pocket.\r\nNow, if you are a man willing to learn, it will give you hints enough\r\nin a year to pay ten times over for your paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“SHUT YOUR MOUTH.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe heard a lad, in anger, use this expression to another. It was not\r\nvery bad advice, though given somewhat roughly.\r\n\r\nWhen we hear some of our mincing misses singing, now away up, and now\r\naway down, tossing their heads and rolling their eyes, we think, Well,\r\nmiss, if you knew what folks thought of you, you’d _shut your mouth_.\r\n\r\nWe have seen many men ruined because they did not know how to _shut\r\ntheir mouth_ when tempted to say “Yes,” to a bad business.\r\n\r\nWhen we see a man standing before the bar just ready to drink, we\r\nthink, Ah! you fine fellow, if you will not keep your mouth shut\r\nbefore _that_ bar, you will, by and by, find yourself before a Bar\r\nwhere it will be shut tight enough.\r\n\r\nWhen we hear a fine lady scolding till every room rings; or tattling\r\nfrom house to house—or scandal-mongering, we think, Ah, you lady, with\r\nall your schooling, you never learned to _shut your mouth_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING WORK ON THE FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThoroughly overhaul your tools; let plows be sharpened; repair their\r\nstocks if anywhere started or weakened; look after the chains, the\r\nswingletrees, the yokes for your oxen, or the harness for your horses.\r\nDon’t have any straps to replace, or harness to tie up with tow\r\nstrings after you get into the fields, and when time is precious. NOW\r\nIS THE TIME TO SAVE TIME, BY GETTING READY. Old rusty buckles will\r\ngive way the moment the plow strikes a root; stitches which have been\r\nlonging for some time to fall out and part, will be likely to do it\r\nwhen you have the least time to mend them. Then we shall hear talk;\r\nyou’ll be cursing the old horse or the old rickety harness, and\r\ndeclaring that your “luck is always on the wrong side;” and you may\r\ndepend upon it, that it always will be, so long as you are not more\r\ncareful. Good luck is a wary old fish which nibbles at everybody’s\r\nhook, but the shrewd and skillful angler only catches it.\r\n\r\nThe opening of spring is usually debilitating both to man and beast.\r\nYour horses cannot stand hard usage at once; some of them will need\r\nphysic—all of them should be put to work carefully; increase their\r\ntask gradually; favor them, and you will get abundantly paid for it\r\nbefore their summer’s work is done.\r\n\r\nA good farmer may be known by the way he manages his spring work.\r\nConsider how much there is of it. Cows are calving; mares foaling;\r\nyoung heifers for the first time to be broken to milking; all the\r\ntools to be got ready; the ground to be broken up and seeded; the\r\norchards to be set; or old ones to be attended to; a garden to be\r\nmade; and a hundred other things to do. Now here is a chance for good\r\nmanagement, and a yet better chance for bad management. There is as\r\nmuch skill in “laying out” a season’s work for the farmer, as there is\r\nin “laying out” a frame for a house or barn.\r\n\r\nBethink you of all the _mistakes_ you made last season; if you made\r\nany good hits, improve upon them this year. Every farmer should\r\nresolve to do _all things_ as well as he did the last year, and _some_\r\nthings a great deal better.\r\n\r\nWhile everything is merry, birds singing, bees at work, cattle frisky,\r\nand the whole animated world is joyous, do but search and see if,\r\namong all beasts, birds, or bugs, you can find one that needs whisky\r\nto do its spring or summer work on?\r\n\r\nLook again; seeds are sprouting; trees budding; flowers peeping out\r\nfrom warm nooks. Everything grows in spring-time. Youth is\r\nspring-time, habits are sprouting, dispositions are putting out their\r\nleaves, opinions are forming, prejudices are getting root. Now take at\r\nleast as good care of your children as you do of your farm. If you\r\ndon’t want to use the land you let it alone, and _weeds_ grow; but\r\nwhen you wish to _improve_ a piece, you turn the natural weeds under,\r\nand sow the right seed, and tend the crop. I have heard good kind of\r\nfolks object to much “_bringing up_” of their boys. They guessed the\r\nlads would come out about right. You break a colt, and break a steer,\r\nand break a heifer, and break a soil, and if you won’t break your\r\nchildren, they will be very likely to break you—heart and pocket.\r\n\r\nFermenting manures should not be hauled or spread until you are ready\r\nto plow them under. [If you spread manure on meadows it should be\r\nfine, and well rotted, and let ashes be liberally mixed with it.] If\r\nyou let manure lie a week or ten days exposed in the fields to the\r\nair, it will waste one half of “its sweetness on the desert air.” Let\r\nthe plow follow the cart as fast as possible, and the gases generated\r\nby your manure will then be taken up by the soil, and held in store\r\nfor your grain.\r\n\r\nDEEP PLOWING.—There may be some rare cases where, for special reasons,\r\nshallow plowing is advisable. But the standing rule upon the farm\r\nshould be deep plowing. A good farmer remarked the other day to us,\r\n“One of my neighbors who is always talking of deep plowing was at it\r\nlast summer, and I followed in the furrow, and his depth did not\r\naverage more than four inches; he did not measure on the _land side_\r\nbut on the mold-board side.” The reasons are very strong for deep\r\nplowing.\r\n\r\n1. When crop after crop is taken off the first four or five inches of\r\ntop earth, it tends speedily to rob it of all materials required by\r\ngrass or grain. Every blade taken from the soil, takes off some\r\nportion of that soil with it.\r\n\r\n2. Deep plowing brings up from beneath a greater amount of earth,\r\nwhich, when subjected to the frosts, the atmosphere, and the action of\r\nthe plow, becomes fit for vegetation.\r\n\r\n3. Summer droughts seldom injure deeply-plowed soils; certainly not to\r\nthat degree that they do shallow soils. The roots penetrate the mellow\r\nmould to a greater depth, and draw thence moisture when the top is as\r\ndry as ashes. Will not some one who is curious in such matters try two\r\nacres side by side plowed shallow and deep, respectively, and give us\r\nthe history of their crop?\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF SEED.—It has been often said that American husbandry was\r\nunfavorably peculiar in stinginess of seed-sowing. It is certain that\r\nvery much greater quantities are employed in Great Britain and on the\r\nContinent than with us, and that much greater crops are obtained per\r\nacre. In part the crop is owing to a superior cultivation; but those\r\nwho have carefully studied the subject affirm that, in part, it is\r\nattributable to the use of much greater quantities of seed. We give a\r\ntable showing the average quantity of seed per acre for different\r\ngrains, in England, Germany, and the United States. The table was\r\nformed in that manufactory of so many valuable articles, the _Albany\r\nCultivator_. It must be remembered that the average crop is not the\r\naverage of the best farming States, but of the whole United States.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                 GERMANY.                  |\r\n  |          Seed per acre—Product.           |\r\n  +----------+-----------------+-----------=--+\r\n  |Wheat,    |  2½ bushels.    |25 bushels.   |\r\n  |Rye,      |  2      “       |25    “       |\r\n  |Barley,   |  2½     “       |35    “       |\r\n  |Oats,     |  2 to 4 “       |40    “       |\r\n  |Millet,   |  7 quarts.      |35    “       |\r\n  |Peas,     |  2½ bushels.    |26    “       |\r\n  |Corn,     | 20 quarts.      |36    “       |\r\n  |Turnips,  |                 |30 to 35 tons.|\r\n  |Buckwheat,|  1 bushel.      |27 bushels.   |\r\n  |Clover,   | 14 pounds.      |              |\r\n  |Flax,     |  2 to 3   bush. |10 bu. seed.  |\r\n  |Hemp,     |  2½ to 3   “    |650 pounds.   |\r\n  |Potatoes, |  5         “    |300 bushels.  |\r\n  +----------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n  +-------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                 ENGLAND.                  |\r\n  |          Seed per acre—Product.           |\r\n  +----------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n  |Wheat,    |  2½ to 3½ bu.   |28 bushels.   |\r\n  |Rye,      |  2 to 2½   “    |25    “       |\r\n  |Barley,   |  2½ to 4   “    |36    “       |\r\n  |Oats,     |  4 to 7    “    |32    “       |\r\n  |Millet,   |                 |              |\r\n  |Peas,     |  3 to 3½   “    |30 to 40 bu.  |\r\n  |Corn,     |                 |              |\r\n  |Turnips,  |  1 to 2 pints.  |30 to 35 tons.|\r\n  |Buckwheat,|  1 to 1½ bush.  |26 bushels.   |\r\n  |Clover,   | 14 to 18 lbs.   |              |\r\n  |Flax,     |  2 to 3 bush.   |10 bu. seed.  |\r\n  |Hemp,     |  3        “     |550 pounds.   |\r\n  |Potatoes, |  8 to 12  “     |250 bushels.  |\r\n  +----------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n  +-------------------------------------------+\r\n  |              UNITED STATES.               |\r\n  |          Seed per acre—Product.           |\r\n  +----------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n  |Wheat,    |  1 to 1½ bush.  |18 bushels.   |\r\n  |Rye,      |  1 to 1½   “    |15    “       |\r\n  |Barley,   |  1½ to 2   “    |25    “       |\r\n  |Oats,     |  2 to 3    “    |35    “       |\r\n  |Millet,   |                 |              |\r\n  |Peas,     |  2 to 2½   “    |25    “       |\r\n  |Corn,     | 20 to 30 qts.   |30    “       |\r\n  |Turnips,  |  1 to 2 lbs.    |20 tons.      |\r\n  |Buckwheat,| 16 to 20 qts.   |15 to 30 bu.  |\r\n  |Clover,   |  5 to 10 lbs.   |              |\r\n  |Flax,     |  1 to 1½ bush.  |8 to 12 bush. |\r\n  |Hemp,     |  1½ to 2½  “    |500 pounds.   |\r\n  |Potatoes, |  8 to 20   “    |175 bushels.  |\r\n  +----------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING WORK IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen spring comes, everybody begins to think of the garden. A little\r\nof the experience of one who has learned some by making many mistakes\r\nwill do you no harm.\r\n\r\nTOO MUCH WORK LAID OUT.—When the winter lets us out, and we are\r\nexhilarated with fresh air, singing birds, bland weather, and\r\nnewly-springing vegetation, our ambition is apt to lay out _too much\r\nwork_. _We_ began with an _acre_, in garden; we could not afford to\r\nhire help except for a few days; and we were ambitious to do things as\r\nthey ought to be done. By reference to a Garden Journal (every man\r\nshould keep one), we find that we planted in 1840, _sixteen_ kinds of\r\npeas; _seventeen_ kinds of beans; _seven_ kinds of corn; _six_ kinds\r\nof squash; _eight_ kinds of cabbage; _seven_ kinds of lettuce; _eight_\r\nsorts of cucumber, and _seven_ of turnips—_seventy-six varieties of\r\nonly eight vegetables_! Besides, we had fruit-trees to transplant in\r\nspring—flowers to nurture, and all the etceteras of a large garden.\r\nAlthough we worked faithfully, early and late, through the whole\r\nseason, the weeds beat us fairly; and every day or two some lazy loon,\r\nwho had not turned two spadefuls of earth during the season, would\r\nlounge along and look over, and seeing the condition of things, would\r\nvery quietly say: “Why, I heard so much about your garden—whew! what\r\nregiments of weeds you keep. I say, neighbor, do you boil that\r\n_parsley_ for greens?” It nettled us, and we sweat at the hoe and\r\nspade all the harder, but in vain; for we _had_ laid out more than\r\n_could_ be well done. Nobody asked how much we _had_ done—they looked\r\nonly at what we had _not_ done. To be sure so many sorts were planted\r\nonly to test their qualities; but the laying out of so large a work in\r\nspring is not wise. _A_ HALF _well done is better than a_ WHOLE _half\r\ndone_. Remember there is a _July_ as well as an April; and _lay_ out\r\nin April as you can _hold_ out in July and August. We have profited by\r\nour own mistakes and have no objections that others should do it.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE GARDEN.—Before you meddle with the garden, do two things:\r\nfirst inspect your seeds, assort them, rejecting the shrunk, the\r\nmildewed, the sprouted, and, generally, the discolored. Buy early,\r\nsuch as you need to purchase. Do not wait till the minute of planting\r\nbefore you get your seeds. Second, make up your mind beforehand just\r\nwhat you mean to do in your garden for the season.\r\n\r\n_Preparation._—Haul your manure and stack it in a corner; do not\r\nspread it till the day that you are ready to turn it under; cut your\r\npea-brush and put it under shelter; inspect your bean-poles and\r\nprocure such as are necessary to replace the rotten or broken ones;\r\ninspect every panel of the garden fence; one rail lost, may ruin, in a\r\nnight, two months’ labor, and more temper and grace than you can\r\nafford to spare in a whole year. Clean up all the stubble, haulm,\r\nstraw, leaves, refuse brush, sticks and rubbish of every sort, and\r\ncast it out, or burn it and distribute the ashes. If you intend to do\r\nyour work in the best manner, see that you have the _sorts_ of manure\r\nthat you may need through the season: ashes, fine old barn-yard\r\nmanure, green long manure, leaf-mold from the wood, top-soil from\r\npastures, etc., etc. Every florist understands the use of these.\r\n\r\nCoarse manure may be put upon your pie-plant bed, as a strong and\r\nsucculent leaf-stalk is desirable. Let it be thoroughly forked, gently\r\nnear the stools and deeply between the rows.\r\n\r\nWith an iron-toothed rake go over your old strawberry beds that are\r\nmatted together, and rake them severely. Strawberries that have been\r\nkept in hills and cleanly tended should be manured between the rows\r\nand gently spaded or forked.\r\n\r\n_Early Sowings._—Tomatoes, egg-plant, early cucumbers, cabbage,\r\ncauliflowers, broccoli, lettuce, melons, celery for an early crop,\r\nshould have been, before this, well advanced in a hot-bed. If not, no\r\ntime is to be lost; and if a first sowing is well along, a second\r\nsowing should be made.\r\n\r\nYou cannot get too early into the ground after the frost is out and\r\nthe wet a little dried, onions for seed or a crop, lettuce, radishes,\r\npeas, spinage, parsnip, early cabbage, and small salads.\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS.—The beds should be attended to; remove all weeds and old\r\nstalks; give a liberal quantity of salt to the bed—if you have old\r\nbrine, or can get fish brine at the stores, that is better than dry\r\nsalt. Asparagus is a _marine_ plant, growing upon sandy beaches along\r\nthe sea coast, and is therefore benefited by salt, to which, in its\r\n_habitat_, it was accustomed. Put about three or four inches of old,\r\nthoroughly rotted manure upon the bed; fork it in gently, so as not to\r\nwound the crowns of the plant. Directions for forming beds belong to a\r\nlater period in the season.\r\n\r\nONIONS.—Should be sown or set early.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer seed, sow, across beds four feet wide, in drills eight\r\ninches apart; young gardeners are apt to begrudge _room_—give it\r\nfreely to everything, and it will repay you; when they come up, thin\r\nout to one for every inch; as you wish young and tender onions for\r\nyour table, draw these, leaving, at least, one every five inches in\r\nthe row. If your soil is deep and very rich, onions can be grown in\r\none season from the seed as well as from the set—we try it almost\r\nevery year and _never fail_, although told a hundred times: “You could\r\ndo that in the old States, but it won’t do out here.” It had to do,\r\nand did do, and always will do, where there is no lazy men about; but\r\nnothing ever does well in a slack and lazy man’s garden; plants have\r\nan inveterate prejudice against such, and won’t grow; but he is a\r\ndarling favorite among weeds.\r\n\r\nThe white or silver skin, and the yellow Portugal have been favorite\r\nkinds with us to raise from seed. They are tender, mild flavored, but\r\ndo not keep as well as the _Red_. _Strong onions always keep better\r\nthan mild ones._\r\n\r\nIf you prefer top-onion sets, or sets of any other kind, plant them\r\nout at the same distances, viz. eight inches between the row and five\r\nor six between the sets. Inexperienced gardeners are afraid that\r\n_little_ sets no bigger than a pea, will not do well. It is a\r\nmistake—they will make large onions; put them _all_ in, if they are\r\nsound. Plant the sets so that the top shall just appear above the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIf you plant out old onions for _seed_, let them be at least a foot\r\napart and stake them when they begin to blossom. If you plant the\r\n_top-onion_ for sets you need not stake them, for they cannot shed out\r\ntheir seed if they fall over. It is not generally known that the same\r\nonions may be kept for seed for many years.\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING.—All fruit-trees, most kinds of shade trees, shrubs,\r\n_hardy_ roses, honeysuckles, pinks, lilacs, peonies, etc., may be\r\nraised, divided, and transplanted in April unless your soil is _very\r\nwet_. All _hardy_ plants may be safely transplanted just as soon as\r\nthe ground is dry enough to crumble freely—and not till then. In\r\nplanting out shrubs, remember that they will _grow_; if you put them\r\nnear together, for the sake of present effect, in a year or two they\r\nwill be crowded. We set at ample distances and fill up the spaces with\r\nlilies, peonies, phlox, gladiolus, and herbaceous plants which are\r\neasily removed.\r\n\r\nFLOWER GARDEN.—Remove the covering from your bulb beds; as soon as the\r\nearth is dry enough to crumble, with a small hoe carefully mellow the\r\nearth _between_ the rows of bulbs, and work it loose with _your\r\nhands_, in the row itself. Leave the surface convex, that superfluous\r\nrain may flow off. Transplant roses that are to be moved. Divide the\r\nroots of such lilies, peonies, irises, etc., as are propagated by\r\ndivision, and replant.\r\n\r\nAs fast as the soil allows, spade up your borders, and flower\r\ncompartments, giving first a good coating of very fine, old,\r\npulverized manure.\r\n\r\nIf you have hot-beds you may bring forward most of your annuals, so as\r\nto turn them out into the open beds as soon as frosts cease.\r\n\r\nBut defer sowing in the open air until the first of April; and then,\r\nsparingly; sow again the middle of April, and on the first of May.\r\nOnly thus, will you be _sure_ of a supply. If you gain more than you\r\nneed by three sowings, should all succeed, you have friends and\r\nneighbors enough, if you are a reasonably decent man, who will be glad\r\nto receive the surplus.\r\n\r\nMANURE.—Corn and potatoes will bear green and unfermented manure. But\r\nall ordinary garden vegetables require _thoroughly_ rotted manure. If\r\nthe soil is sandy, leached ashes may be applied with great profit at\r\nthe rate of seventy or eighty bushels the acre. The soil is made more\r\nretentive of moisture, and valuable ingredients are secured to it.\r\nSalt may be used with great advantage on all garden soils, but\r\nespecially upon light and sandy ones. Thus treated, soils will resist\r\nsummer droughts and be moist when otherwise they would suffer. Salt\r\nhas also a good effect in destroying vermin, and it adds very valuable\r\nchemical ingredients to the soil. Soapsuds should be carefully saved\r\nand poured about currants, gooseberries and fruit-trees. Charcoal,\r\npulverized, is excellent, as it absorbs ammonia from the atmosphere,\r\nor from any body containing it, and yields it to the plants. Let a\r\nbarrel be set near the house filled with powdered charcoal. Empty into\r\nit all the _chamber-ley_. The ammonia will be taken up by the\r\ncharcoal, and the barrel will be without any offensive smell. But as\r\nsoon as the charcoal is saturated, it will begin to give out the\r\npeculiar odor of urine. Let the charcoal then be mixed with about five\r\ntimes its bulk of fresh earth and well worked together, and it will\r\nafford a very powerful manure for vegetables and flowers. In Europe,\r\nwhere manure is precious, it is estimated that the excrementitious\r\nmatter, slops, suds, scraps, etc., of a family, will supply one acre,\r\nfor each member, with manure.[3] There are few families whose offal\r\nwould not afford abundant material for enriching the garden, and with\r\nsubstances peculiarly fitted for flowers, fruits, and esculent roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [3] See note, p. 98, Colman’s Tour, 2d part, where is given\r\n     an estimate by a distinguished agricultural chemist, Mr.\r\n     Haywood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFALL WORK IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting seeds may be performed for very early spring use. Lettuce,\r\nspinage, and radishes, may be sown in a sheltered spot, and they will\r\ncome forward ten days or a fortnight earlier than those which shall\r\nhave been sown, in spring.\r\n\r\n_Clearing up_ the garden should be thoroughly performed. Let pea-brush\r\nbe removed, bean poles and flower stakes be collected and put under\r\nshelter. Collect all refuse vines, haulm, stems and stalks and wheel\r\nthem to a corner to rot, or to be ready for use in covering\r\nflower-beds. Let the alleys be hoed out for the last time, and it will\r\nbe as good as one hoeing in the spring, when they will probably be too\r\nwet to hoe. Gravel may now be laid in the walks; if ashes are to be\r\nspread, it may be done in autumn, and save time in the spring.\r\n\r\nAll tender plants are to be removed or secured by covering.\r\n\r\nThe best covering to secure the earth from frost, that we know of, is\r\na layer of leaves, say three inches thick when well packed down, and\r\n_upon them_ two or three inches of chip dirt, with the coarsest part\r\non top. We have had the soil unfrozen in severe winters when so\r\ncovered. In this manner, tuberoses, gladiolus, dahlias, tiger flowers,\r\netc., may be kept out through the winter. The gladiolus thus treated\r\nmakes splendid tufts of blossoms. It may be prudent to try only a few\r\nat first, and adventure more as experience gives confidence.\r\n\r\nCELERY which is to be left in the trenches should first be well\r\ncovered with straw, and then boards should be placed upon the top in\r\nsuch a manner as to shed the rain. Great quantities of wet rot it when\r\nit is not growing; and freezing and thawing _in the light_ destroys\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIf portions of the garden have been infested with cutworms, etc., let\r\nit be spaded and thrown up loosely just before freezing weather. A\r\nclay soil will be ameliorated by frosts, if treated in the same way. A\r\nlight, loose soil, should not be worked in the fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGUARDING CHERRY-TREES FROM COLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is peculiarly liable while young, but more especially when\r\ncoming into bearing, to be roughly handled by our winters. The bark at\r\nthe surface of the ground splits, and often the trunk, enfeebling the\r\ntree and sometimes destroying it. The evil does not result from the\r\ncold, but from the action of bright suns upon the frozen trunk. Let\r\nthose having valuable young trees, prepare them for winter by giving a\r\ncheap covering to the trunks, so that the sun shall not strike them.\r\nThis may be done by tying about them bass matting, long straw,\r\ncorn-stalks, or any similar protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADE-TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that no man ever walked under the magnificent elms upon the\r\nBoston Common, or beneath the Lindens in Philadelphia, or through Elm\r\nstreet in New Haven, without conviction of the beauty and utility of\r\nshade-trees. Trees not only are objects of beauty—the architecture of\r\nNature—but they promote both health and comfort. Our ardent summers,\r\nfrom June to October, make open, unshaded streets, almost impassable,\r\nand reflect heat upon our dwellings from the side-walks and beaten\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nIn this country the growth of trees is so rapid, and the supply from\r\nour own forests so abundant and convenient that every village and\r\ncity, and every well-conducted farm should be lined with shade-trees.\r\nWe will offer a few suggestions upon the kinds to be selected and the\r\nmanner of setting.\r\n\r\nTHE LOCUST (_Robinia pseudacacia_).—This tree is very popular, and is\r\nalmost the only one at the West set for shade-trees. It has a\r\nbeautiful form, grows very rapidly, bears a profusion of beautiful and\r\nvery fragrant blossoms (pendulous racemes of pea-shaped flowers), its\r\nfoliage is singularly pleasing—the young leaves being of a light\r\npea-green, and growing darker with age, so that in the same tree three\r\nor four distinct shades of green may be seen; it grows freely in all\r\nsoils, and is not infested by any worms; its timber is almost as\r\ndurable as cedar, and in the West, is not subject to the attacks of\r\nthe _borer_, as it is in the East.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the tree becomes unsymmetrical with age, it is\r\nbrittle, breaking easily at slight wounds, even when they have healed\r\nover. It is not a long-lived tree, and requires careful protection\r\nfrom cattle.\r\n\r\nWe would advise a more sparing use of it. Let _every other_ tree be a\r\nLocust, and the alternate maple or elm, oak, tulip, etc. By this\r\nmethod the Locust will afford immediate shade, and when they become\r\nunsightly the intervening trees will have grown to a goodly size. The\r\nLocust should be transplanted just as the buds are ready to burst;\r\nthey should be protected by frames as soon as set. Good cases may be\r\nmade at a trifling expense, by taking strips of inch and a half stuff,\r\nthree inches wide, and nine or ten feet long, sharpen the lower end,\r\nand drive it into the ground four or five inches, and in a box formed\r\nabout the tree let crosspieces be nailed at the top. Be careful that\r\nthe tree does not _rub_ upon the case, although the wound will heal\r\nover, yet in the first high wind, it will be apt to break off at that\r\npoint. This tree is rather peculiar in that respect.\r\n\r\nThe Locust was introduced to Europe by a Frenchman named Robin. From\r\nhim the genus (_Robinia_) took its name. There are but four species\r\nbelonging to it, and they are all indigenous to North America, viz.:\r\n\r\n_Robinia pseudacacia_ (common Locust). _R. viscosa_, confined to the\r\nsouthwestern parts of the Alleghany Mountains, bearing rose-colored\r\nblossoms and being even more ornamental than the former; it is equally\r\nhardy, and if it could be introduced among us would form a valuable\r\naddition. Locusts nowhere appear to a better advantage than when\r\nplanted in clumps of six or eight on a lawn, and if the _R.\r\npseudacacia_ and _R. viscosa_ were contiguous, blending the pure white\r\nand the rose-colored blossoms, the world might be challenged for a\r\nfiner effect.\r\n\r\nThe _R. hispida_ (_rose-acacia_ of our gardens) is a highly ornamental\r\nshrub, its branches are, like the moss-rose, covered with minute\r\nspines, which give it a fine appearance. A fourth species is said to\r\nexist in the basin of Red River. The favorable opinion here expressed\r\nof the Locust, will remove any impression of prejudice when we say,\r\nthat _they are altogether too much cultivated_. Our forests are full\r\nof magnificent shade-trees whose claims can never, all things\r\nconsidered, be equalled by the Locust.\r\n\r\nELM (_Ulmus Americana_), commonly called White Elm. Of the four\r\nspecies of elms indigenous to the United States, but two are\r\nparticularly worth notice, the White Elm, and Slippery Elm (_U.\r\npulva_). But the former of these is so incomparably the superior, that\r\nit should be selected wherever it can be had. It attains a height of\r\none hundred feet, is very long-lived, grows more and more beautiful\r\nwith age, its long branches droop over, forming graceful pendulous\r\nextremities; and no one who has seen the Boston Mall, or the New Haven\r\nelms, or those scattered along the villages of Connecticut, will think\r\nthat Michaux exaggerated in pronouncing this tree to be _the most\r\nmagnificent vegetable production of the Temperate Zone_. It is\r\nunquestionably the monarch among shade-trees, as superior to the oak\r\nfor avenues and streets, as the oak is to it for parks and forests.\r\nThe great main-street of every village should be lined with White\r\nElms, set at distances of fifty feet, and Locusts between to supply an\r\nimmediate shade, and to be removed so soon as the slower-growing elm\r\nhas spread enough to dispense with them.\r\n\r\nTHE MAPLE.—The following varieties are in our forests, and are\r\nbeautiful shade-trees for the borders of farms, door-yards, public\r\nsquares, avenues, streets, etc. The Sugar Maple (_Acer saccharinum_),\r\nWhite Maple (_A. eriocarpum_), Red Maple (_A. rubrum_). This last\r\nvariety shows beautiful red flowers before its leaves put out in\r\nspring, and, like the sugar-maple, brilliant scarlet leaves in autumn.\r\nThe maple is a beautiful tree of fine form, the leaves of the\r\ndifferent varieties are variously shaped and all beautiful, it is free\r\nfrom disease and noxious insects.\r\n\r\nBesides these, the ash, oak, tulip, beech and walnut, are all worthy\r\nof being transferred to our streets. Shade-trees for door-yards, and\r\npublic squares, and pleasure-grounds, require a separate notice, as in\r\nsome material respects they should be differently treated.\r\n\r\nWe warmly recommend in lining streets, that each alternate tree only\r\nbe locust.\r\n\r\nIt is better for _effect_ that each street, or at least continuous\r\nportions of each, have _one kind_ of forest tree, so that an avenue of\r\nsimilar trees be formed. In planting grounds, it is well to group\r\ntrees of different kinds, but in streets an avenue should be of elms,\r\nor of oaks, or of sycamores, or of maples, and not all of them mingled\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLEA FOR HEALTH AND FLORICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one knows to what an extent women are afflicted with nervous\r\ndisorders, _neuralgic_ affections as they are more softly termed. Is\r\nit equally well known that formerly when women partook from childhood,\r\nof out-of-door labors, were confined less to heated rooms and exciting\r\nstudies, they had, comparatively, few disorders of this nature. With\r\nthe progress of society, _fevers_ increase first, because luxurious\r\neating vitiates the blood; _dyspepsia_ follows next, because the\r\nstomach, instead of being a laboratory, is turned into a mere\r\nwarehouse, into which everything is packed, from the foundation to the\r\nroof, by gustatory _stevedores_. Last of all come _neuralgic_\r\ncomplaints, springing from the muscular enfeeblement and the nervous\r\nexcitability of the system.\r\n\r\nLate hours at night, and later morning hours, early application to\r\nbooks, a steady training for _accomplishments_, viz. embroidery,\r\nlace-work, painting rice paper, casting wax-flowers so ingeniously\r\nthat no mortal can tell what is meant, lilies looking like huge\r\ngoblets, dahlias resembling a battered cabbage; these, together with\r\npractisings on the piano, or if something extra is meant, a little\r\ntum, tum, tuming, on the harp, and a little ting-tong on the guitar;\r\nreading “ladies’ books,” crying over novels, writing in albums, and\r\noriginal correspondence with my ever-adored Matilda Euphrosyne, are\r\nthe materials, too often, of a fashionable education. While all this\r\nrefinement is being put on, girls are taught from eight years old,\r\nthat the chief end of women is to get a beau, and convert him into a\r\nhusband. Therefore, every action must be _on purpose_, must have a\r\ndiscreet object in view. Girls must not walk fast, that is not\r\nlady-like; nor run, that would be shockingly vulgar; nor scamper over\r\nfields, merry and free as the bees or the birds, laughing till the\r\ncheeks are rosy, and romping till the blood marches merrily in every\r\nvein; for, says prudent mamma, “my dear, do you think Mr. Lack-a-daisy\r\nwould marry a girl whom he saw acting so unfashionably?” Thus, in\r\nevery part of education those things are pursued, whose tendency is to\r\nexcite the brain and nervous system, and for the most part those\r\nthings are not “_refined_,” which would develop the muscular system,\r\ngive a natural fullness to the form, and health and vigor to every\r\norgan of it.\r\n\r\nThe evil does not end upon the victim of fashionable education. Her\r\nfeebleness, and morbid tastes, and preternatural excitability are\r\ntransmitted to her children, and to their children. If it were not for\r\nthe rural habits and health of the vast proportion of our population,\r\ntrained to hearty labor on the soil, the degeneracy of the race in\r\ncities would soon make civilization a curse to the health of mankind.\r\n\r\nNow we have not one word to say against “accomplishments” when they\r\nare _real_, and are not purchased at the expense of a girl’s\r\nconstitution. She may dance like Miriam, paint like Raphael, make wax\r\nfruit till the birds come and peck at the cunning imitation; she may\r\nplay like Orpheus harping after Eurydice (or what will be more to the\r\npurpose, like a Eurydice after an Orpheus), she may sing and write\r\npoetry to the moon, and to every star in the heavens, and every flower\r\non earth, to zephyrs, to memory, to friendship, and to whatever is\r\nimaginable in the spheres, or on the world—if she will, in the midst\r\nof these ineffable things, remember the most important facts, that\r\n_health_ is a blessing; that God made health to depend upon exercise,\r\nand temperate living in all respects; and that the great objects of\r\nour existence, in respect to ourselves, is a virtuous and pious\r\ncharacter, and in respect to others, the raising and training of a\r\nfamily after such a sort that neither we, nor men, nor God, shall be\r\nashamed of them.\r\n\r\nNow we are not quite so enthusiastic as to suppose that floriculture\r\nhas in it a balm for all these mentioned ills. We are very moderate in\r\nour expectations, believing, only, that it may become a very important\r\nauxiliary in maintaining health of body and purity of mind.\r\n\r\nWhen once a mind has been touched with zeal in floriculture it seldom\r\nforgets its love. If our children were early made little enthusiasts\r\nfor the garden, when they were old they would not depart from it. A\r\nwoman’s perception of the beauty of form, of colors, of arrangement,\r\nis naturally quicker and truer than man’s. Why should they admire\r\nthese only in painting, in dress, and in furniture? Can human art\r\nequal what God has made, in variety, hue, grace, symmetry, order and\r\ndelicacy? A beautiful engraving is often admired by those who never\r\nlook at a natural landscape; ladies become connoisseurs of\r\n“artificials,” who live in proximity to real flowers without a spark\r\nof enthusiasm for them. We are persuaded that, if parents, instead of\r\nregarding a disposition to train flowers as a useless trouble, a waste\r\nof time, a pernicious romancing, would inspire the love of it, nurture\r\nand direct it, it would save their daughters from _false taste_, and\r\nall love of meretricious ornament. The most enthusiastic lovers of\r\nnature catch something of the simplicity and truthfulness of nature.\r\n\r\nNow a constant temptation to female vanity—(if it may be supposed for\r\nthe sake of argument, to exist) is a display of person, of dress, of\r\nequipage. In olden times, without entirely hating their beauty, our\r\nmothers used to be proud of their spinning, their weaving, their\r\ncuriously-wrought apparel for bed and board. A pride in what we have\r\n_done_ is not, if in due measure, wrong or unwise; and we really think\r\nthat rivalry among the young in rearing the choicest plants, the most\r\nresplendent flowers, would be altogether a wise exchange for a rivalry\r\nof lace, and ribbons, and silks. And, even if poor human nature must\r\nbe forced to allow the privilege of criticising each other something\r\nseverely, it would be much more amiable to pull roses to pieces, than\r\nto pull caps; all the shafts which are now cast at the luckless\r\nbeauty, might more harmlessly be cast upon the glowing shield of her\r\ndahlias or upon the cup of her tulips.\r\n\r\nA love of flowers would beget early rising, industry, habits of close\r\nobservation, and of reading. It would incline the mind to notice\r\nnatural phenomena, and to reason upon them. It would occupy the mind\r\nwith pure thoughts, and inspire a sweet and gentle enthusiasm;\r\nmaintain simplicity of taste; and in connection with personal\r\ninstruction, unfold in the heart an enlarged, unstraitened, ardent\r\npiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING YOUNG PIGS IN WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is both negligence, and mistake, in the way of wintering pigs. I\r\nam not talking to those whose manner of keeping stock is, to let stock\r\ntake care of themselves; but to farmers who _mean to be careful_. Hogs\r\nshould be _sorted_. The little ones will, otherwise, be cheated at the\r\ntrough, and overlaid and smothered in the sleeping-heap. There should\r\nnot be too many in one inclosure; especially young pigs should not\r\nsleep in crowds; for, although they sleep warmer, they will suffer on\r\nthat very account. Lying in piles, they get sweaty; the skin is much\r\nmore sensitive to the cold, and coming out in the morning reaking and\r\nsmoking, the keen air pierces them. In this way, young pigs die off\r\nthrough the winter by being too warm at night. If you have the\r\nland-shark and alligator breed, however, you should crowd these\r\ntogether, for the more they die off the better for the farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET POTATOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough our practice has been more extensive, and is more skillful,\r\nin eating sweet potatoes than in raising them, we yet adventure some\r\nremarks: No root can live and grow without food from the leaf; if the\r\ntops be permitted to root, so much nutriment is subtracted from the\r\ntubers as is diverted to these new roots. Those who are best skilled\r\nin their cultivation, raise their vines up so as to detach the roots,\r\nbut do not twist them round the hill; which, by crushing or covering\r\nthe leaves, would render the vines unhealthy. As to vines of the\r\n_Cucurbitacæ_, their fruit not being under ground, it is not necessary\r\nthat such an amount of prepared sap should go to the root as if tubers\r\nwere formed. There is, in such vines, a great liability to disease and\r\ninjury near the hill. The vines shrink and dry near the base; and\r\nhowever flourishing the running end may otherwise be, it is destroyed.\r\nIf roots are secured at several points along the vine, we remove the\r\nchances of its prematurely dying, without withdrawing any sap\r\nnecessary for the maturation of its fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF BOTTOM-LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost every kind of soil requires a management of its own. That\r\nproper for clays, and that proper for bottom-lands, cannot be\r\ninterchanged. Bottom lands are usually composed largely of vegetable\r\nmatter and sand; and are therefore light, and easy to work; yet, as\r\nthey are now managed, they admit a less variety of crops than the\r\ntougher and more unmanageable clay lands.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM-LANDS FOR CORN.—Our corn-lands, strictly so called, consist of\r\nrich intervales and river bottoms. On these corn is raised year after\r\nyear, without manuring, fallowing, clover, or any change; but one\r\nconstant, successive corn, corn, corn. It is supposed that corn may be\r\nhad for an indefinite period, so far as mere exhaustion of the soil is\r\nconcerned, if the right course is pursued. Some of the best farmers in\r\nthis region _hog_ their corn lands. _Hogging_ is turning the hogs in\r\nupon the ripe corn, and letting them harvest it in their own way. The\r\nsaving of labor of gathering the corn and feeding it out is very\r\ngreat. Some single farmers fatten from one to five hundred head of\r\nhogs; but if this number were fed by hand and the grain gathered for\r\nthem it would require a force which would eat up the profits. When the\r\nfatting hogs have eaten off the field (temporary fences divide large\r\nfields into inclosures of convenient size) they are turned into\r\nanother, and the stock-hogs for another year, are let in to glean and\r\nroot for the waste and trampled corn. In this way nothing is lost.\r\n\r\nThis method _takes very little off from the land_; for the droppings\r\nof the hogs returns a great amount of food for the soil; and the corn\r\nstalks being burned or turned under, the land continues in good heart.\r\nLand being hogged will be _free from cut-worms_; for the continual\r\nrooting of the stock-hogs, which continues until the ground freezes,\r\nthrows up the eggs or insect to be destroyed by the winter. This\r\nmethod of cultivation is peculiarly suited to large farms, where\r\nextensive tracts of ground are kept under the plow.\r\n\r\nBut in the course of eight or ten years, this process renders the soil\r\nextremely light. The action of frost upon it, after the hogs have\r\nsnout-plowed it, leaves it in the spring as light and dry as an\r\nash-heap. The corn will still _grow_ as well, but every high wind\r\nwill throw it down; the soil has not tenacity enough to hold up its\r\ncrop. _Clovering_ has been resorted to by some good farmers as a\r\nremedy; but without pretending to know certainly, we suspect that\r\nclover will not fully answer the object. Clover on hard soils,\r\nseparates the particles and renders the ground lighter, and adds\r\nvegetable matter to its composition. This is not what bottom land\r\nneeds. It is _too_ light, and rich enough in vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nWe believe a better course will be found in putting _bottom-lands to\r\nsmall grain_. To be sure, there are difficulties in the way of this;\r\nbut good farming is nothing but a compromise of difficulties. If the\r\nmonth of May be cold and backward, wheat will do well and yield\r\nfreely. But if the spring is forward, May warm and wet, the grain will\r\nrun rank, break down when the head begins to fill, and, of course, the\r\nberry, however plump and well it might have looked in the milk, will,\r\nafter it falls, for want of nourishment, light, and air, shrink and\r\nshrivel. But even in such springs, might not an over rankness be\r\nprevented by pasturing the grain; or even mowing it, when, as it\r\nsometimes happens, it gets ahead of what cattle are put upon it. But,\r\nat the worst, the grain is not lost; for if it lodges, and is spoiled\r\nfor the sickle, hogs may be turned upon it and they will thrive well.\r\n\r\nBut now comes the advantage of small grain to the soil, which will be\r\nthe same whether the crop is reaped or hogged. The straw or stubble,\r\nin either case, remains upon the ground. This should not be _plowed\r\nin_, but _burned, and the ashes plowed under_. To do this a strip of\r\neight feet should be plowed about the whole field; and fire put to it,\r\n_on every side at once_, so that it may burn towards the centre; for\r\nfire, driven across a field, would leap many feet of open space at a\r\nfence. The more stubble the better, and the more weeds the better. The\r\nashes will give to the soil just what it lacks, cohesion or firmness,\r\nand moisture. For, to make a dry soil moist, requires some substance\r\nto be added, which, having an affinity for moisture, shall attract and\r\nretain it. This is the nature of wood or straw ashes. A gentleman who\r\nwill recognize in the above much of his own practical experience,\r\nmentioned to us a singular fact in corroboration of this reasoning.\r\nHaving a very heavy wheat or oat stubble on a bottom-land field, which\r\nmade it very hard for the plow, he burned it over; but a smart\r\nthunder-storm coming suddenly up, the fire was extinguished, leaving\r\nabout five acres in the middle of the piece, unburned. The whole field\r\nwas then plowed. It was found that the soil in the part burned over\r\nwas more firm, and moist, all the ensuing summer; and the corn more\r\neven, and darker colored, than that upon the five acres which escaped\r\nthe fire, and whose stubble had been plowed in.\r\n\r\nAt all events, there can be no doubt that wood-ashes would be very\r\nadvantageous to bottom lands. And we are persuaded that such soils may\r\nbe kept in wheat and corn for any length of time, if thus managed. In\r\nconclusion, corn your bottom-lands till they are too light, hogging\r\ninstead of harvesting them; then put in wheat or oats; leave the\r\nstubble long, burn it over, and put it into wheat again, or to corn,\r\nas the case may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two opinions which will prevent any attempt to improve the\r\ncultivation of wheat, or, indeed, of anything else. The first is the\r\nopinion that, what are called _wheat-lands_, yield enough at any rate:\r\nthe second is the opinion of those who own a soil not naturally good\r\nfor wheat, that there is no use in trying to raise much to the acre.\r\nWe suppose that wheat will not _average_ more than twelve bushels to\r\nthe acre, as it is now cultivated in some parts. At that rate, and\r\nwith too low prices, it is not worth cultivation for commercial\r\npurposes. The cost of seed, of labor in preparing the soil, putting in\r\nthe crop, harvesting, threshing, and carrying it to market, is greater\r\nthan the value of the crop. At fifty cents a bushel, and twelve\r\nbushels to the acre, the farmer gets six dollars, which certainly does\r\nnot cover the worth of his time and the interest on his land.\r\n\r\nIs it possible, then, at an expense within the means of ordinary\r\nfarmers, to bring a double or treble crop of wheat? If nature has set\r\nlimits to the produce of this grain to the acre, and if our farmers\r\nhave come up to that limit, there is no use in their trying to do any\r\nbetter. But if their crop is four fold behind what it ought to be,\r\nthey will feel courage to reach out for a better mode of cultivation.\r\nVegetables collect food from the atmosphere, and from the soil; and\r\ndifferent plants select different articles of food from the soil, just\r\nas different birds, beasts, insects, etc., require different food. One\r\nclass of plants draws potash largely from the soil, as turnips,\r\npotatoes, the stalk of corn, etc. Another class requires lime, in\r\ngreat measure, as tobacco, pea straw, etc. Liebig partially classifies\r\nplants according to the principal food which they require; as silica\r\nplants, lime plants, potash plants, etc.\r\n\r\nEvery plant being composed of certain chemical elements, requires for\r\nits perfection a soil containing those elements. Thus chemistry has\r\nshown, by exact analysis, that good meadow hay contains the following\r\nelements: Silica (sand), lime (as a phosphate, a sulphate, and a\r\ncarbonate, i. e. lime combined with phosphoric, sulphuric, and\r\ncarbonic acids), potash (as a chloride, and a sulphate), magnesia,\r\niron, and soda. Whatever soil is rich in these will be productive of\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nThe grain of wheat (in distinction from the straw) contains, and of\r\ncourse requires from the soil, sulphates of potash, soda, lime,\r\nmagnesia, iron, etc.\r\n\r\nAny vegetable, in its proper latitude, will flourish in a soil which\r\nwill yield it an abundance of food; and decline in a soil which is\r\nbarren of the proper nutritive ingredients.\r\n\r\nA practical, scientific knowledge of these fundamental facts, will\r\ngive an intelligent farmer, in grain-growing latitudes, almost\r\nunlimited power over his crops. A good cook knows what things are\r\nrequired for bread; he selects these materials, compounds them to\r\ndefinite proportions—adding, if any one is deficient; subtracting, if\r\nany one is in excess. Raising a crop is a species of slow cooking.\r\nHere is a compound of such materials (called wheat) to be made. Nature\r\nagrees to knead them together, and produce the grain, if the farmer\r\nwill supply the materials. To do this he _must_ understand what these\r\nmaterials are. Suppose a cook perceiving that the bread was wretched,\r\ndid not know exactly what was the matter; and should add, salt, or\r\nflour, or yeast, or water at hap-hazard? Yet that is exactly what\r\nmultitudes of farmers do. They find that their fields yield a small\r\ncrop of wheat. They do not know what the matter is. Is the soil\r\ndeficient in lime, or sand, or clay? Is magnesia or potash lacking?\r\nPerhaps they do not even know that these things are requisite to this\r\ncrop. “The land must be manured.” Now, manure on an impracticable\r\nsoil, is _medicine_. Of course if the farmer prescribes, he must tell\r\n_what_ medicine, i. e. what manure. Is it vegetable matter or\r\nphosphates? alumina or silica? Suppose a doctor says: “You are sick\r\nand must take medicine,” without knowing what the disease is, or what\r\nthe appropriate remedy; and so should pull out a handful of whatever\r\nthere was in his saddle-bags and dose the wretch? That’s the way\r\nfarming goes on. “The ten acre lot wants manure.” To the barn yard he\r\ngoes, takes the dung heap, plows it under, and gets an enormous crop\r\nof—straw.  Nitrogenous manure was not what the soil wanted. He has\r\nadded materials which existed in abundance already; but those\r\nelements, from the want of which his crop suffered, have not been\r\ngiven it. The land is sicker than it was before. It languishes for\r\nwant of one element, it suffers from a surfeit of another. We are\r\nprepared to sustain these observations by a reference to authentic\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, a few years ago, was not a wheat-growing State.\r\nCautious farmers had given up the crop, because neither soil nor\r\nclimate was supposed to favor it. How then have both soil and climate\r\nbeen persuaded to relent, and permit from twenty to forty bushels to\r\ngrow to the acre? It was no accident, and no series of blind but lucky\r\nblunders, that effected the change. It was _thinking_ that did it. _It\r\nwas a change wrought by science._ Elliot (in Connecticut), Deane (both\r\nclergymen), Dexter, Lowell, Fessenden, and many others, all men of\r\nscience, were pioneers. Agricultural surveys, geological surveys, and\r\nskillful chemical analyses of the soil and its products have been made\r\nfor, now, a series of years. A Hitchcock, a Dana, a Jackson have\r\napplied science to agriculture. Pamphlets, books, and widely\r\ncirculated newspapers have diffused this knowledge. Agricultural\r\nsocieties, state and county; farmers’ meetings for discussion, such as\r\nare held every winter in Boston, have awakened the _mind_ of farmers,\r\nand by learning to treat their soils skillfully, good wheat is raised\r\nin large quantities on soils naturally very averse to wheat.\r\n\r\nThe average crop of wheat in great Britain is _twenty-six_ bushels to\r\nthe acre, but forty and fifty are common to good farmers; sixty,\r\nseventy, and even eighty have been raised by great care.\r\n\r\nIn the whole United States it will not average much more than fifteen.\r\nA comparison of the two countries will show a corresponding\r\ninferiority on our part in the application of _science_ to\r\nagriculture. Scotland, formerly, hardly raised wheat. Since the\r\nformation of the Highland Agricultural Society in Scotland, wheat has\r\n_averaged_ fifty-one bushels to the acre!—_Ellsworth’s Report for\r\n1844_, p. 16.\r\n\r\nLord Hardwicke stated, in a speech before the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety of England, that fine Suffolk wheat had produced _seventy-six_\r\nbushels per acre; and another and improved variety had yielded\r\n_eighty-two_ bushels per acre! This was the result of “book farming”\r\nin a country where anti-book farmers raise _twenty-six_ bushels to the\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nThose very operations which farmers call _practical_, and upon which\r\nthey rely in decrying “book farming” were first made known by science,\r\nand through the writings of scientific men.\r\n\r\nThese views have an immediate and practical bearing on the cultivation\r\nof wheat in the Western States.\r\n\r\nHitherto the want of enough cleared land has led farmers to put in\r\nwheat among the corn, and _half_ put it in at that. Others have plowed\r\ntheir fallows, or their grass lands, so early in the season, that\r\nrains and settling have made it hard again by seed-time. Then, without\r\nstirring it, the grain has been thrown (away) upon it, and half\r\nharrowed in and left to its fate. Equally bad has been the system of\r\nlate single plowing. Others have given their grain no soil to bed\r\ntheir roots in; a scratched surface receives the grain; its roots,\r\nlike the steward, cannot dig, and so get no hold; and are either\r\nwinter killed, or subsist upon the scanty food of the three or four\r\ninches of top soil. With some single exceptions, wheat cannot be said\r\nto have been _cultivated_ yet. The two great operations in rendering\r\nsoil productive of wheat, are either the _development of the materials\r\nalready in the soil; or, the addition to the soil of properties which\r\nare wanting_.\r\n\r\nMuch land yielding only twelve or fifteen bushels, by a better\r\npreparation would, just as easily, yield thirty. Let us suppose that a\r\ncommon plowing of four or five inches, precedes sowing. Out of this\r\nsuperficial soil the wheat is to draw its food. Constant cropping has,\r\nperhaps, already diminished its abundance. Then wheat is rank in stem,\r\nshort in the head, and light in the kernel. But below there is a bed\r\nof materials untouched. The subsoil, if brought up, exposed to the\r\nameliorating influence of the elements, will furnish in great\r\nabundance the elements required. The simple operation of deep and\r\nthorough plowing will, often, be enough to increase the crop one-half.\r\nDeep plowing gives a place for the roots, which will not be apt to\r\nheave out in winter; it saves the wheat from drought, it gives the\r\nnourishment of twice the quantity of soil to the crop.\r\n\r\nFive acres may become ten by enlarging the soil _downward_. These\r\nremarks are desultory; and, while we intend to continue writing on the\r\nsubject, we say to such as may be getting ready for the wheat-sowing,\r\n_plow deeply and thoroughly_; unlike corn, wheat can only be plowed\r\nonce, and that at the beginning. It should be thoroughly done, then,\r\nonce for all.\r\n\r\nWHEAT LANDS ought to be so farmed as to grow better from year to year;\r\ncertainly, they ought to hold their own. Lands may be kept in heart by\r\nthe adoption of a rotation suited to each particular soil; or, if\r\nfrequent wheat crops are raised, by fallows or manuring. It is a fact\r\nthat in this neighborhood farms in the hands of careful men are\r\nyielding better crops of wheat every year; while multitudes of farmers\r\nthink themselves fortunate in twelve or fifteen bushels to the acre,\r\nthere is another class who expect twenty-five or thirty bushels, and\r\nin good seasons get it. This is encouraging. As our lands get older we\r\nmay look for yet better things. Some farmers put in from 100 to 800,\r\nand even 1,000 acres of wheat. The native qualities of the soil are\r\nrelied upon for the crop. To manure or clover such a body of land is\r\nimpossible with any capital at the command of its owners. But with us,\r\neach owner of a quarter section puts in from ten to twenty acres, and\r\nit lies within his means to dress this quantity of land to a high\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nSOILS FIT FOR WHEAT.—A vegetable mold cannot yield wheat, because it\r\ndoes not contain, and therefore cannot afford to the crop, silicate of\r\npotash, or phosphate of magnesia; the first of which gives strength to\r\nthe stem, and the second of which is necessary to the grain. On such\r\nsoil wheat may grow as a grass, but not as a grain.\r\n\r\nA mere sand will not yield wheat; because wheat requires, and such\r\nsoils do not contain, soda, magnesia, and especially silicate of\r\npotash.\r\n\r\nAll clays contain potash, which is indispensable to wheat, but they\r\nmay be deficient in soda, in magnesia, and in other alkalies.\r\n\r\nA calcareous clay-loam may be regarded as the best soil for wheat. And\r\nwhen it does not exist in a natural state, all the additions in the\r\nform of manure should be with reference to the formation of such a\r\nsoil. If the land be light and sandy, clay, and marl, and wood ashes\r\nshould be added, together with barnyard manure; if the soil is a\r\ntenacious clay, it should be warmed and mellowed by sand and manure;\r\nif it is deficient in lime, lime in substance, or in marl must be\r\ngiven; vegetable molds, if heavily dressed with wood-ashes and lime,\r\nmay be brought to produce wheat.\r\n\r\nTO PREPARE THE GROUND.—This operation depends upon the condition of\r\nthe soil. But, in all cases, the deepest plowing is the best. The\r\nroots of wheat, if unchecked, will extend more than _five feet_.\r\nStiff, tough, soils, unbroken for years, and especially if much\r\ntrampled by cattle, will require strong teams. Oxen are better than\r\nhorses to break up with. It has been said, that a yoke of cattle draw\r\na plow deeper, naturally, than a span of horses. They are certainly\r\nbetter fitted for dull, dead, heavy pulling. And if oxen have been\r\nwell trained they will do as much plowing in a season as horses, and\r\ncome out of the work in better condition.\r\n\r\nFallow lands should be broken up early in summer, as soon as corn\r\nplanting is over; about midsummer plow again; and the last time early\r\nin September to prepare for seed.\r\n\r\nA grass or clover lay[4] may be plowed under deeply at midsummer, and\r\nnot disturbed till sowing-time; and the fall plowing should not\r\ndisturb the inverted sod.\r\n\r\nWhen wheat is to be sown on wheat again, as large a part of the straw\r\nshould be left in the harvest-field as possible. This is to be plowed\r\nunder; but, if it can be done without endangering the fences, it would\r\nbe better to _burn it over_; the ashes will contain all the valuable\r\nsalts. On this point we extract the following note appended by the\r\neditor of _Liebig’s Agricultural Chemistry_.\r\n\r\n     “In some parts of the grand-duchy of Hesse, where wood is\r\n     scarce and dear, it is customary for the common people to\r\n     club together and build baking-ovens, which are heated with\r\n     straw instead of wood. The ashes of this straw are carefully\r\n     collected and sold every year at very high prices. The\r\n     farmers there have found by experience that the ashes of\r\n     straw form the very best manure for wheat; although it\r\n     exerts no influence on the growth of fallow-crops (potatoes\r\n     or the leguminosæ, for example). The stem of wheat grown in\r\n     this way possesses an uncommon strength. The cause of the\r\n     favorable action of these ashes will be apparent, when it is\r\n     considered that all corn-plants require silicate of potash;\r\n     and that the ashes of straw consist almost entirely of this\r\n     compound.”\r\n\r\nBut this procedure does not depend upon theoretical reasonings; it has\r\nbeen abundantly substantiated by the practice of English cultivators.\r\nWe find on page 333 of the “British Husbandry,” an admirable work\r\npublished under the superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion\r\nof Useful Knowledge, the following statement:\r\n\r\n     “The _ashes of burnt straw_ have also been found beneficial\r\n     by many intelligent practical farmers, from some of whose\r\n     experiments we select the following instances. Advantage was\r\n     taken of a fine day to fire the stubble of an oat-field soon\r\n     after harvest, the precaution having been previously taken\r\n     of sweeping round the boundary to prevent injury to the\r\n     hedges. The operation was easily performed, by simply\r\n     applying a light to windward, and it completely destroyed\r\n     every weed that grew, leaving the surface completely covered\r\n     with ashes; and the following crop, which was wheat,\r\n     produced full five quarters per acre. This excited further\r\n     experiment, the result of which was, that in the following\r\n     season, the stubble having been partly plowed in according\r\n     to the common practice, and partly burned, and the land sown\r\n     with wheat, the crop produced eight bushels per acre more on\r\n     that portion which had been burned, than on that which had\r\n     been plowed in. The same experiment was repeated, on\r\n     different occasions, with similar results; and a following\r\n     crop of oats having been laid down with seeds, the clover\r\n     was found perfectly healthy, while that portion on which the\r\n     burning of the stubble had been omitted, was choked with\r\n     weeds. It must, however, be recollected, that if intended to\r\n     have a decided effect, the stubble must be left of a\r\n     considerable length, which will occasion a material\r\n     deficiency of farmyard manure; though the advantages will be\r\n     gained of saving the cost of moving the stubs, the seeds of\r\n     weeds and insects will be considerably destroyed, and the\r\n     land will be left unimpeded for the operation of the plow.\r\n\r\n     “On the wolds of Lincolnshire, the practice of not only\r\n     burning the stubble, but even the straw of threshed grain,\r\n     has been carried, in many cases, to the extent of four to\r\n     six loads per acre; and, as it is described in the report of\r\n     the county, has been attended, in all those instances, with\r\n     very decidedly good effect. It is even said to have been\r\n     found superior, in some comparative trials, to yard-dung, in\r\n     the respective rate of five tons of straw to ten of manure!”\r\n\r\nWe frequently ride past immense piles of wheat straw, encumbering the\r\nyard or field where it was threshed; and never without thinking upon\r\nthe unthriftiness of a farmer who ignorantly takes everything off his\r\nwheat land, returns nothing to it, and is content with annually\r\ndiminishing crops.\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF SEEDS.—The varieties of wheat, already very numerous, are\r\nconstantly increasing. No farmer should be satisfied with anything\r\nshort of the _best_ kind of wheat. Suppose an expense of many dollars\r\nto have been incurred in procuring a new kind, if it yield only two\r\nbushels more to the acre than an old sort, it will more than pay for\r\nitself in the first harvest field. It should be observed that\r\ndifferent soils require different varieties; and every farmer should\r\nselect, after trial, the kind which agrees best with his land.\r\n\r\nA standard wheat should be hardy, strong in the straw; not easy to\r\nshell and waste, prolific, thin in the bran, white in flour, and the\r\nflour rich in starch and gluten. The earliness or lateness of a\r\nvariety affects its liability to disease.\r\n\r\nMuch may be done by every farmer to secure a variety suited to his\r\nsoil from his own fields. Let a watchful eye observe every remarkable\r\nhead of wheat—a very early one, a very long head, any which have an\r\nunusual sized grain, or is distinguished for any excellent property.\r\nBy gathering, planting separately, and then culling again, each farmer\r\nmay improve his own wheat ten fold. Indeed it has been in this way\r\nthat several improved varieties have been procured.\r\n\r\nOf spring wheat, the most valuable kinds are, _Italian Spring Wheat_;\r\nbearded, red berry, white chaff, head long, bran thick, flour of fair\r\nquality. _Tea_ or _Siberian Bald_; bright straw, not long; berry\r\nwhite, bald; flour good; extensively cultivated in New England and\r\nnorthern part of New York. Valuable variety.\r\n\r\nBLACK SEA WHEAT.—White chaff, bearded, berry red, long and heavy, bran\r\nthick, flour inferior. Ripens very early, and seldom rusts or mildews.\r\n\r\nThe following are also the spring varieties. _Egyptian Wild Goose or\r\nCalifornia._—Large and branching head, bearded, berry small, bran\r\nthick, flour coarse and yellow, ripens late, and subject to rust.\r\nAlthough branching, it is not productive. There is a winter variety\r\nalso. _Rock Wheat_, from Spain.—Chaff white, bearded, berry red and\r\nlong, bran thick, flour of fair quality, hardy, shows small, well\r\nadapted for new lands and late sowing. _Black Bearded._—Long\r\ncultivated in New York—stem large, heavy head, berry large and red,\r\nbeard very long and stiff, produces flour well. _Red Bearded_,\r\nEnglish.—Chaff red, bearded, beards standing out, berry white, weighs\r\nfrom sixty to sixty-two pounds. _Scotch Wheat._—A large white wheat,\r\nberry and straw large.\r\n\r\nSpring wheat does well on soils which heave and throw out winter\r\nwheat. It is deemed a good policy to sow some spring wheat every year,\r\nthat, if the winter wheat fails, a crop may still be on hand.\r\n\r\nAn account of the best varieties of winter wheat, we extract from the\r\n_Western Farmer and Gardener_:\r\n\r\n     “WHITE FLINT.—A winter wheat, very white chaff, withstood\r\n     Hessian fly well, has yielded fifty-four bushels to the\r\n     acre, weighing from sixty-three to sixty-seven pounds per\r\n     bushel. _Improved White Flint._—This from early selection\r\n     from the first. _White Provence, from France._—A white\r\n     wheat—shows small heads, well filled and large. _Old Red\r\n     Chaff._—White wheat, old—subject to fly. _Kentucky, White\r\n     Bearded._— White wheat, sometimes called Canadian\r\n     Flint—early, good for clay soils. _Indiana Wheat._—White\r\n     wheat—berry white and large, ripens early, not so flinty as\r\n     the White Flint, good flour, valuable for clayey soils.\r\n     _Velvet Beard, or Crate Wheat._—White wheat—English variety,\r\n     chaff reddish, berry large and red, straw large and long,\r\n     heads long and well filled, beard very stiff, flour\r\n     yellowish. _Soule’s Wheat._—A mixed variety, heads large,\r\n     berry white, not very hardy. _Beaver Dam._—Old variety,\r\n     berry red, flour yellowish, ripens late. _Eclipse._—English,\r\n     not hardy. _Virginia White May_, from Virginia.—Winter, good\r\n     flour, chaff white. _Wheatland Wheat_, from Virginia.—Chaff\r\n     red, heads well filled, berry red, hardy. _Tuscan Bald_,\r\n     from Italy in 1837.—Berry large and white, not hardy, flour\r\n     good. _Tuscan Bearded._—Head large, still less hardy.\r\n     _Yorkshire_, from England, ten years ago.—Mixed variety of\r\n     white and red chaff, bald, berry white, good flour, liable\r\n     to injury from insects, subject to ergot. _Bellevere\r\n     Tallavera._—White variety from England, head large, tillers\r\n     well, not hardy, insects like it much. _Pegglesham_,\r\n     English.—Head large, berry white, and medium sized, tender\r\n     for our winters—(all this is calculated for New York State.)\r\n     _Golden Drop_, English.—Berry red, flour not first rate.\r\n     _Skinner Wheat._—Produced from crosses, berry red, chaff\r\n     white, hardy, yield good, sixty-four pounds to the bushel.\r\n     _Mediterranean._—Chaff light, red bearded, berry red and\r\n     long, very flinty, flour inferior. _Hume’s White Wheat_ from\r\n     crosses.—A beautiful white wheat, berry large, bran thin,\r\n     hardy and a valuable variety. _Blue Stem._—Cultivated for\r\n     thirty-three years, berry white, sixty-four pounds to the\r\n     bushel, flour superior, bran thin, and very productive.\r\n     _Valparaiso Wheat_, from South America.—Chaff white, bald,\r\n     berry white, bran thin, a good variety.”\r\n\r\nPREPARING SEED FOR SOWING.—Seed wheat should be subjected to a process\r\nwhich shall separate all chess, cockle, etc., from it, together with\r\nthe shrunken kernels of the wheat itself. This may be, in part, done\r\nby screening; but the light grain will float and may thus be detected\r\nin the process of brining. Two tubs, or half barrels, may be\r\nconveniently used. A strong brine of salt and water is preferred, and\r\nthe wheat, in convenient parcels, is poured in, the light wheat\r\nskimmed from the top, the brine poured off into the second tub, and\r\nthe heavy wheat at the bottom put into some suitable receptacle to\r\ndrain for an hour. When in successive parcels the whole quantity to be\r\nused has been brined, let it be emptied upon a smooth floor, and limed\r\nat the rate of about a bushel of lime to ten of wheat. By this process\r\nthe chaffy grain is rejected, the smut, to which wheat is so liable,\r\nis entirely prevented; and the grain caused to germinate more rapidly\r\nand strongly. The lime should be what is termed _quicklime_, or that\r\njust slaked. The reason may be explained. No seed can germinate until\r\nit has rid itself of a large part of that carbon, which, being\r\nessential to its _preservation_, must be withdrawn in order that it\r\nmay grow. The addition of oxygen from air and water converts the\r\ncarbon to carbonic acid, which is emitted from the pores, and escapes.\r\nNewly slaked lime has a powerful affinity for carbonic acid; and by\r\nwithdrawing it from the seed, puts it in a condition favorable to\r\nimmediate germination. Lime that has been air-slaked or lain exposed\r\nto the air after being slaked by water, combines with the carbonic\r\nacid in the atmosphere, and when applied to wheat, being already a\r\ncarbonate, it does not liberate the carbonic acid contained in the\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPLEASURES OF HORTICULTURE.—There is no writing so detestable as\r\nso-called _fine writing_. It is painted emptiness. We especially\r\ndetest fine writing about rural affairs—all the senseless gabble about\r\ndew, and zephyrs, and stars, and sunrises—about flowers, and green\r\ntrees, golden grain and lowing herds, etc. We always suspect a design\r\nupon our admiration, and take care not to admire. In short,\r\n_geoponical cant, and pastoral cant, and rural cant_ in their length\r\nand breadth, are like the whole long catalogue of cants (not excepting\r\nthe German Kant), intolerable. Now and then, however, somebody writes\r\nas though he knew something; and then a free and bold strain of\r\ncommendation upon rural affairs is relishful.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [4] The word _lay_, or _ley_, is only a different way of\r\n     spelling _lea_, the old English word for _field_, not used\r\n     except in poetry or by farmers; and it is one, among many\r\n     instances, of old Saxon English words being preserved among\r\n     the agricultural population long after they have ceased to\r\n     be generally used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL USE OF LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two facts in the functions of the leaf, which are worth\r\nconsideration on account of their practical bearings. The food of\r\nplants is, for the most part, taken in solution, through its roots.\r\nVarious minerals—silex, lime, alumen, magnesia, potassa—are passed\r\ninto the tree in a dissolved state. The sap passes to the leaf, the\r\nsuperfluous water is given off, _but not the substances which it held\r\nin solution_. These, in part, are distributed through the plant, and,\r\nin part, remain as a _deposit in the cells of the leaf_. Gradually the\r\nleaf chokes up, its functions are impeded, and finally entirely\r\nstopped. When the leaf drops, it contains a large _per cent._ of\r\nmineral matter. An autumnal or old leaf yields, upon analysis, a very\r\nmuch larger proportion of earthy matter than a vernal leaf, which,\r\nbeing yet young, has not received within its cells any considerable\r\ndeposit. It will be found also, that the leaves contain a very much\r\nhigher _per cent._ of mineral matter, than _the wood of the trunk_.\r\nThe dried leaves of the elm contain more than eleven _per cent._ of\r\nashes (earthy matter), while the wood contains less than two _per\r\ncent._; those of the willow, more than eight _per cent._, while the\r\nwood has only 0.45; those of beech 6.69, the wood only 0.36; those of\r\nthe (European) oak 4.05, the wood only 0.21; those of the pitch-pine\r\n3.15, the wood only 0.25 _per cent._[5]\r\n\r\nIt is very plain, from these facts, that, in forests, the mineral\r\ningredients of the soil perform a sort of _circulation_; entering the\r\nroot, they are deposited in the leaf; then, with it, fall to the\r\nearth, and by its decay, they are restored to the soil, again to\r\ntravel their circuit. Forest soils, therefore, instead of being\r\nimpoverished by the growth of trees, receive back annually the\r\ngreatest proportion of those mineral elements necessary to the tree,\r\nand besides, much organized matter received into the plant from the\r\natmosphere; soils therefore are gaining instead of losing. If owners\r\nof parks or groves, for neatness’ sake, or to obtain leaves for other\r\npurposes, gather the annual harvest of leaves, they will, in time,\r\ntake away great quantities of mineral matter, by which the soil,\r\nultimately, will be impoverished, unless it is restored by manures.\r\n\r\nLeaf-manure has always been held in high esteem by gardeners. But many\r\nregard it as a purely _vegetable substance_; whereas, it is the best\r\nmineral manure that can be applied to the soil. What are called\r\nvegetable loams (not peat soils, made up principally of decomposed\r\n_roots_), contain large quantities of earthy matter, being\r\nmineral-vegetable, rather than vegetable soils.\r\n\r\nEvery gardener should know, that the best manure for any plant is the\r\ndecomposed leaves and substance of its own species. This fact will\r\nsuggest the proper course with reference to the leaves, tops, vines,\r\nhaulm, and other vegetable refuse of the garden.\r\n\r\nThe other fact connected with the leaf, is its function of\r\n_Exhalation_. The greatest proportion of crude sap which ascends the\r\ntrunk, upon reaching the leaf, is given forth again to the atmosphere,\r\nby means of a particularly beautiful economy. The _quantity_ of\r\nmoisture produced by a plant is hardly dreamed of by those who have\r\nnot specially informed themselves. The experiments of Hales have been\r\noften quoted. A sun-flower, three and a half feet high, presenting a\r\nsurface of 5.616 square inches exposed to the sun, was found to\r\nperspire at the rate of twenty to thirty ounces avoirdupois every\r\ntwelve hours, or seventeen times more than a man. A vine with twelve\r\nsquare feet exhaled at the rate of five or six ounces a day. A\r\nseedling apple-tree, with twelve square feet of foliage, lost nine\r\nounces a day.[6]\r\n\r\nThese are experiments upon very small plants. The vast amount of\r\nsurface presented by a large tree must give off immense quantities of\r\nmoisture. The practical bearings of this fact of vegetable exhalation\r\nare not a few. Wet forest-lands, by being cleared of timber, become\r\ndry; and streams, fed from such sources, become almost extinct as\r\ncivilization encroaches on wild woods. The excessive dampness of\r\ncrowded gardens is not singular, and still less is it strange that\r\ndwellings covered with vines, whose windows are choked with shrubs,\r\nand whose roof is overhung with branches of trees, should be\r\nintolerably damp; and when the good housewife is scrubbing, scouring\r\nand brushing, and nevertheless, marvelling that her house is so\r\ninfested with mold, she hardly suspects that her troubles would be\r\nmore easily removed by the axe or saw, than by all her cloths and\r\nbrushes. A house should never be closely surrounded with shrubs. A\r\nfree circulation of air should be maintained all about it, and\r\nshade-trees so disposed as to leave large openings for the light and\r\nsun to enter. Unusual rains in any season produce so great a dampness\r\nin our residences that no one can fail to notice its effect, both on\r\nthe health of the occupants, and upon the beauty and good condition of\r\ntheir household substance.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe following method to destroy weeds is pursued at the mint in Paris,\r\nwith good effect: 10 gallons water, 20 lbs. quicklime And 2 lbs.\r\nflowers of sulphur are to be boiled in an iron vessel; after settling,\r\nthe clear part is thrown off and used when needed. Care must be taken,\r\nfor if it will destroy weeds it will just as certainly destroy edgings\r\nand border flowers if sprinkled on them. Weeds, thus treated, will\r\ndisappear for several years.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [5] See Dr. Grey’s Botanic Text Book, an admirable work,\r\n     which every horticulturist should own and study.\r\n\r\n     [6] Lindley’s Horticulture, p. 42-44. Grey’s Botany, p. 131.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING WORK FOR PUBLIC-SPIRITED MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADE-TREES.—One of the first things that will require your action is,\r\nthe planting of _shade-trees_. Get your neighbors to join with you.\r\nAgree to do four times as much as your share, and you will, perhaps,\r\nthen obtain some help. Try to get some more to do the same in each\r\nstreet of your village or town.\r\n\r\n_Locusts_, of course you will set for immediate shade. They will in\r\nthree years afford you a delightful verdant umbrella as long as the\r\nstreet. But _maples_ form a charming row, and the autumnal tints of\r\ntheir leaves and the spring flowers add to their beauty. They grow\r\nquite rapidly, and in six years, if the soil is good and the trees\r\nproperly set, they will begin to cast a decided shadow. Elms are, by\r\nfar, the noblest tree that can be set, but they will have their own\r\ntime to grow. It is best then to set them in a row of other trees, at\r\nabout fifty or a hundred feet apart, the intervening space to be\r\noccupied with quicker-growing varieties.\r\n\r\nThe beech, buckeye, horse-chesnut, sycamore, chestnut, and many others\r\nmay be employed with advantage. Now, do not let your court-house\r\nsquare look any longer so barren.\r\n\r\n_Avenues_ may be lined with rows of trees, but squares and open spaces\r\nshould have them grouped or scattered in small knots and parcels in a\r\nmore natural manner.\r\n\r\nMAY-WEED.—There was never a better time to exterminate this\r\nvillainous, stinking weed than summer-time will be. Just as soon as\r\nthe first blossoms show, “up and at it.” Club together in your streets\r\nand agree to spend one day _a-mowing_. Keep it down thoroughly for one\r\nseason and it will no longer bedrabble your wife’s and daughter’s\r\ndresses, nor fill the air with its pungent stench, or weary the eye\r\nwith its everlasting white and yellow.\r\n\r\nSIDE-WALKS. What if your neighbors are lazy; what if they do not care?\r\nSome one ought to see that there are good gravel walks in each\r\nvillage. You can have them in this way: Take your horse and cart and\r\nmake them before your own grounds, and then go on no matter who owns,\r\nand when your neighbors see that _you_ have public spirit, they will,\r\nby and by, be ready to help you. But the grand way to do nothing, is,\r\nnot to lift a finger yourself, and then to rail at your\r\nfellow-citizens as selfish and devoid of all public spirit.\r\n\r\nPROTECT PUBLIC PROPERTY.—What if it does concern everybody else as\r\nmuch as it does you? Some one ought to see that the fences about every\r\nsquare are kept in repair. Some one ought to save the trees from\r\ncattle; some one ought to have things in such trim as that the\r\ninhabitants can be proud of their own town. Pride is not decent when\r\nthere is nothing to be proud of; but when things are worthy of it, no\r\nman can be decent who is devoid of a proper pride. The church, the\r\nschoolhouse, fences, trees, bridges, roads, public squares, sidewalks,\r\nthese are things which tell tales about people. A stranger, seeking a\r\nlocation, can hardly think well of a place, in which the distinction\r\nbetween the house and stye are not obvious; in which every one is lazy\r\nwhen greediness does not excite him, and where general indolence\r\nleaves no time to think of the public good.\r\n\r\nWhen politicians are on the point of dissolving in the very fervent\r\nheat of their love for the public, it would recall the fainting soul\r\nquicker than hartshorn or vinegar to ask them—Did you ever set out a\r\nshade-tree in the street? Did you ever take an hour’s pains about your\r\nown village? Have you secured it a lyceum? Have you watched over its\r\nschools? Have you aided in any arrangements for the relief of the\r\npoor? Have you shown any _practical_ zeal for good roads, good\r\nbridges, good sidewalks, good schoolhouses, good churches? Have the\r\nyoung men in your place a public library?\r\n\r\nIf the question were put to many distinguished village patriots, What\r\nhave you done for the public good?—the answer would be: “Why, I’ve\r\ntalked till I’m hoarse, and an ungrateful public refuse me any office\r\nby which I may show my love of public affairs in a more practical\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS AND FARMING SCENES IN THE WEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one goes to Holland they are all Dutch farmers there; if he\r\ngoes to England he finds British husbandry; in New England it’s all\r\nYankee farming. A man must go to the West to see a little of every\r\nsort of farming that ever existed, and some sorts we will affirm,\r\nnever had an existence before anywhere else—the purely indigenous\r\nfarming of the great valley. Within an hour’s ride of each other is\r\nthe Swiss with his vineyard, the Dutchman with his spade, the\r\n“Pennsylvany Dutch” and his barn, the Yankee and his notions, the\r\nKentuckian and his stock, the Irishman and his shillelah, the Welchman\r\nand his cheese, besides the supple French and smooth Italian, with\r\nhere and there a Swede and a very good sprinkling of Indians.\r\n\r\nAway yonder to the right is a little patch of thirty acres owned by a\r\nYankee. He keeps good cows, _one_ horse only (fat enough for half a\r\ndozen); every hour of the year, save only nights and Sabbath-days he\r\nis at work, and neat fences, clean door-yard, a nice barn, good crops,\r\nand a profitable dairy, and money at interest, show the results. What\r\nif he has but thirty acres, they are worth any two hundred around him,\r\nif what a man makes is a criterion of the value of his farm. But a\r\nlittle farther out is a jolly old Kentucky farmer, the owner of about\r\nfive hundred acres of the best land in the county, which he tills when\r\nhe has nothing else to do. He is a great hunter and must go out for\r\nthree or four days every season after deer. He loves office quite\r\nwell, and is always willing to “serve the public” for a\r\nconsid-er-a-tion, as Trapbois would say. As to farming, he hires more\r\nthan he works; but, now and then, as at planting or harvesting, he\r\nwill lay hold for a week or a month with perfect farming fury, and\r\nthat’s the last of it. As to working every day and every hour, it\r\nwould be intolerable! He is a great horse-raiser, is fond of stock,\r\nand if a free and easy fellow ready to laugh, not careful of his\r\npurse, nor particular about his time, will ride over his grounds,\r\nadmire his cattle, his bluegrass pasture, his Pattons and his Durhams;\r\nand above all, that blooded filly, or that colt of Sir Archie’s—our\r\nKentucky farmer will declare him the finest fellow alive, and his\r\nhouse will be open to him from year’s end to year’s end again.\r\n\r\nRight along side of him is a “Pennsylvany Dutch,” good-natured,\r\nlaborious, frugal and prosperous. He minds his own business. Seldom\r\nwrangles for office. Is not very public spirited, although he likes\r\nvery well to see things prosper. He farms carefully on the old\r\napproved plan of his father, plants by the signs in the moon, seldom\r\nchanges his habits, and on the whole constitutes a very substantial,\r\nclean, industrious, but unenterprising farmer.\r\n\r\nThen there is a _New York_ Yankee; he has got a grand piece of land,\r\nhas paid for it, and got money to boot; he knows a little about\r\neverything; he “lays off” the timber for a fine large house—bossed the\r\njob himself. When it was up he stuck on a kitchen, then a pantry on to\r\nthat, then a pump-room on that, then a wood-house on that, and then a\r\nsmoke-house for the fag end; a fine garden, a snug little nursery well\r\ntended, good orchards; by and by a second farm, pretty soon a boy on\r\nit, all married and fixed off; by and by again another snug little\r\nfarm, and then another boy on it, with a little wife to help him; and\r\nthen a spruce young fellow is seen about the premises, and after a\r\nwhile a daughter disappears and may be found some miles off on a good\r\nfarm, making butter and raising children, and has good luck at both.\r\nThe old man is getting fat, has money lent out, loves to see his\r\nfriends, house neat as a pin, glorious place to visit, etc., etc. But\r\nwho can tell how many sorts more there are in the great heterogeneous\r\nWest, and how amusing the mixture often is, and what strange customs\r\ngrow out of the mingling of so many diverse materials. It is like a\r\nkaleidoscope, every turn gives a new sight. We will take our leisure,\r\nand give some sketches of men, and manners and scenery, as we have\r\nseen them in the West.\r\n\r\nAbout eight years ago a raw Dutchman, whose only English was a\r\ngood-natured _yes_ to every possible question, got employment here as\r\na stable-man. His wages were six dollars and board; that was $36 in\r\nsix months, for not one cent did he spend. He washed his own shirt and\r\nstockings, mended and patched his own breeches, paid for his tobacco\r\nby some odd jobs, and laid by his wages. The next six months, being\r\nnow able to talk “goot Inglish,” he obtained eight dollars a month,\r\nand at the end of six months more had $48, making in all for the year\r\n$84. The second year, by varying his employment—sawing wood in winter,\r\nworking for the corporation in summer, making garden in spring, he\r\nlaid by $100, and the third year $125, making in three years $309.\r\n\r\nWith this he bought 80 acres of land. It was as wild as when the deer\r\nfled over it, and the Indian pursued him. How should he get a living\r\nwhile clearing it? Thus he did it. He hires a man to clear and fence\r\nten acres. He himself remains in town to earn the money to pay for the\r\nclearing. Behold him! already risen a degree, he is an employer! In\r\ntwo years’ time he has twenty acres well cleared, a log-house and\r\nstable, and money enough to buy stock and tools. He now rises another\r\nstep in the world, for he gets married, and with his amply-built,\r\nbroad-faced, good-natured wife, he gives up the town and is a regular\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nIn Germany he owned nothing and never could; his wages were nominal,\r\nhis diet chiefly vegetable, and his prospect was, that he would be\r\nobliged to labor as a menial for life, barely earning a subsistence\r\nand not leaving enough to bury him. In five years, he has become the\r\nowner in fee simple of a good farm, with comfortable fixtures, a\r\nprospect of rural wealth, an independent life, and, by the blessing of\r\nheaven and his wife, of an endless posterity. Two words tell the whole\r\nstory—Industry and Economy. These two words will make any man rich at\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nWe know of another case. While Gesenius, the world-wide famous Hebrew\r\nscholar, was as school, he had a bench-fellow named Eitlegeorge. I\r\nknow nothing of his former life. But ten years ago I knew him in\r\nCincinnati as a baker, and a first-rate one too; and while Gesenius\r\nissued books and got fame, Eitlegeorge issued bread and got money. At\r\nlength he disappeared from the city. Travelling from Cincinnati to\r\nIndianapolis, a year or two since, I came upon a farm of such fine\r\nland that it attracted my attention, and induced me to ask for the\r\nowner. It belonged to our friend of the oven! There was a whole\r\ntownship belonging to him, and a good use he appeared to make of it.\r\nCourage then, ye bakers! In a short time you may raise wheat instead\r\nof molding dough.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA HOLE IN THE POCKET.—If it were not for these holes in the pocket, we\r\nshould all be rich. A pocket is like a cistern, a small leak at the\r\nbottom is worse than a large pump at the top. God sends _rain_ enough\r\nevery year, but it is not every man that will take pains to catch it;\r\nand it is not every man that catches it who knows how to keep it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORNAMENTAL SHRUBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA description of a few of the desirable flowering and ornamental\r\nshrubs for yards and lawns may enable our readers to select with\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nPRIVET.—This is quite beautiful as a single plant; but is universally\r\nemployed for hedges, verdant screens, etc. There is an evergreen\r\nvariety, originally from Italy, by far the best. The roots of this\r\nplant are fibrous, don’t spread much; the limbs endure the shears very\r\npatiently; it grows very rapidly, two full seasons being sufficient to\r\nform a hedge; and it will flourish under the shade and drip of trees.\r\n\r\nROSE ACACIA (_Robinia hispida_).—This is a species of the locust, of a\r\ndwarf habit, seldom growing six feet in height, and covered with fine\r\nspines which give its branches a mossy appearance. Its blossoms\r\nresemble the locust, but are of a pink color. It is often grafted upon\r\nthe locust to give it a higher head and better growth. It should be in\r\nevery shrubbery.\r\n\r\nVENETIAN SUMACH, or smoke tree (_Rhus cotinus_).—The peculiarity of\r\nthis shrub is in the large bunches of russet-colored seed-vessels,\r\nlooking, at a little distance, like a puff of smoke. The French and\r\nGermans call it _periwig-tree_, from the resemblance of these russet\r\nmasses to a powdered wig. It grows freely, and is highly ornamental.\r\n\r\nThere are two other species of sumach worthy of cultivation; the _Rhus\r\ntyphina_, or Stag’s Horn sumach, of a fine flower, and whose leaves\r\nturn in autumn to a beautiful purplish red; and the _R. glabra_, or\r\nScarlet sumach, having red flowers and fruit of a velvety scarlet\r\nappearance, changing as it ripens to crimson.\r\n\r\nSYRINGA, or Mock Orange (_Philadelphus coronarius_), is a beautiful\r\nshrub, having, in the spring, flowers of a pure white, and of an odor\r\nonly less exquisite than that of the orange; whence one of its popular\r\nnames. The leaves have the smell of the cucumber, and are sometimes\r\nused in spring to flavor salads. It grows freely, even under the shade\r\nof trees, which, in all low shrubs, is a valuable quality. There is\r\nalso a large flowered inodorous variety. The popular name, Syringa, is\r\nthe botanical name of the lilac; but these plants are not in the\r\nremotest degree related to each other.\r\n\r\nLILAC.—This well-known and favorite little tree requires only to be\r\nmentioned. There is a white variety, and delicately-leaved variety\r\ncalled the Persian.\r\n\r\nSNOWBALL (_Viburnum opulus_), everywhere known, and everywhere a\r\nfavorite; and scarcely less so is the\r\n\r\nWAXBERRY, or Snowberry, (_Symphora racemosa_), introduced by Lewis and\r\nClark to the public attention, and first raised from seed by McMahan,\r\na gardener of some note. When its fruit is grown, it has a beautiful\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nTAMARISK (_Tamarix gallica_), a sub-evergreen of very beautiful\r\nfeathery foliage, of rapid growth, and highly ornamental in a\r\nshrubbery. It will grow in very poor soil.\r\n\r\nSHEPARDIA, or Buffalo Berry, from the Rocky Mountains, a low tree,\r\nwith small silvery leaves, a currant-like fruit, which is edible. This\r\nis worthy of cultivation. It is diœcious, and the male and female\r\ntrees must therefore be planted in proximity.\r\n\r\nDWARF ALMOND (_Amygdalus nana_), but now called by botanists Cerasus\r\nor Prunus japonica. This favorite shrub is found in all gardens and\r\nyards. The profusion of its blossoms and the delicacy of their color\r\nmake it, during the short time of its inflorescence, deservedly a\r\nfavorite. As it flowers before its leaves put forth, it requires a\r\ngreen background to produce its full effect. It should therefore be\r\nplanted against evergreens.\r\n\r\nWOOD HONEYSUCKLE (_Azalea_).—This is a native of North America, and is\r\nperfectly hardy. It flourishes best in a half shade, and flowers\r\nfreely. There have been a vast number of varieties originated from\r\ncrossing the species; and the nurseries will supply almost every shade\r\nof color from white to brilliant flame color.\r\n\r\nThe _A. pontica_ is also hardy; but the Chinese species require a\r\ngreenhouse. This is one of the most magnificent shrubs that can be\r\ncultivated, and deserves the special attention of those who wish to\r\nform even a moderately good shrubbery.\r\n\r\nThe BERBERRY (_Berberis vulgaris_) is quite beautiful when in fruit.\r\nIt is easily propagated, grows in any soil, requires little pruning,\r\nand is very good fur hedges.\r\n\r\nGLOBE FLOWER (_Corchorus japonica_).—A very pretty shrub with double\r\nyellow flowers, which are in abundance early in the summer, and also,\r\nbut sparingly, shown throughout the season.\r\n\r\n     “By some mistake _Kerria japonica_ was at first supposed to\r\n     belong to Corchorus, a genus of Tiliaceæ, and of course\r\n     nearly allied to the lime-tree; to which it bears no\r\n     resemblance, though it is still called _Corchorus japonica_\r\n     in the nurseries. It is also singular, that though the\r\n     double-flowered variety was introduced into England in 1700,\r\n     the species was not introduced till 1835. It is a delicate\r\n     little shrub, too slender to support itself in the open air;\r\n     but when trained against a wall, flowering in great\r\n     profusion. It should be grown in a light, rich soil, and it\r\n     is propagated by cuttings.”—_Companion to the Flower Garden._\r\n\r\nLABURNUM (_Cytisus laburnum_).—This beautiful plant forms a small\r\ntree, which, in May, is covered with pendant yellow blossoms. Blooming\r\nat the same time with the lilac, the two planted together have an\r\nextremely beautiful effect. It is hardy, grows in any soil, and is\r\npropagated easily by seed.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch Laburnum (_C. alpinus_), is much more beautiful than the\r\ncommon kind, “the flowers and leaves being larger and the flower more\r\nfrequently fragrant. They are also produced much later in the season,\r\nnot coming into flower till the others are quite over.”\r\n\r\nALTHEA, or Rose of Sharon (_Hibiscus Syriacus_).—One of the most\r\ndesirable shrubs for yards and gardens. The form of the shrub is\r\ncompact and sightly; flowers double, and may be had of every color; it\r\nis hardy, growing well in all soils, and blooms continually from the\r\nlast of July till frost. It is beautiful in avenues, and, being\r\npatient of the shears, it will form a fine _floral_ hedge, a good\r\nspecimen of which may be seen on Mr. Hoffner’s beautiful grounds near\r\nCincinnati. The single altheas are not so desirable. We regard this\r\nshrub as worthy of much more extensive cultivation than it has\r\nreceived. Its flowers are coarse on a close inspection, but at a\r\nlittle distance, and among other plants its effect is excellent. It is\r\nvery easily propagated by cuttings, or from the seed.\r\n\r\nSWEET-SCENTED SHRUB (_Calycanthus Floridus_).—Chiefly desirable from\r\nthe pine-apple fragrance of its brownish-purple flowers. They are used\r\nto scent drawers, to carry in the pocket, etc. It grows freely in any\r\ndry, rich soil, and is propagated by layers and suckers.\r\n\r\nRED-BUD (_Cercis Canadensis_).—This small tree is familiar to every\r\none, being the first spring flowering tree of our woods. It flourishes\r\nin gardens and makes a finer appearance there than in its native\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRIES.—Let those who are accustomed to lose their fruit by\r\nmildew, drench their bushes with an alkaline wash. Lime-water, or\r\ndiluted lye are the most convenient. With a watering-pot, copiously\r\nwater the whole bush, on the upper and under side of the branches;\r\nwhich can be easily done, if one will lift the branches while another\r\nbestows the shower-bath. After they have done bearing, prune out the\r\nhead, and the lower branches, so as to give a _free circulation of\r\nair_ under and through the bush. Spade in about them a liberal\r\ndressing of leached ashes, and fine charcoal if procurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK FOR AUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dahlias_ will require special attention to secure them from splitting\r\ndown, and breaking; let every part be well supported by ties. The cool\r\nnights and warm days of approaching fall will give them their most\r\nvigorous growth.\r\n\r\nSAVING SEED.—Beet, spinage, peas, celery, salsify, lettuce seeds will\r\nnow be ripe and should be gathered. Even if not quite ripe, they may\r\nbe plucked, as experiments seem to show that seeds are more injured by\r\nover-ripeness than under-ripening. Seal up your peas in bottles and\r\nput wax about the cork, according to Dr. Plummer’s directions, and the\r\nlarvæ of the pea-bug will die for want of air. Seeds are ripened best\r\nin their own pods or receptacles; and where they ripen nearly at the\r\nsame time, and do not easily shake out, we hang the whole plant in an\r\nairy shed, barn, etc., until winter; and then, for convenience, thresh\r\nout and pack up.\r\n\r\nAs fast as your perennial plants have shed their flowers, let the seed\r\nplants be destroyed, unless you wish to save seed, as the ripening of\r\nseed exhausts the root.\r\n\r\nYoung peach-trees should have the side shoots cleared away and one\r\nstrong centre stem secured for budding in the fall.\r\n\r\nOnions may now be gathered. Let them lie a day or two on the bed or in\r\nthe alley, and then be transferred to a cool and airy place. The sets\r\nfor top onions may be tied in bundles and hung up till spring.\r\n\r\nWhere peas and bush beans have been cleared away, turnips may be sowed\r\nfor a fall and winter crop.\r\n\r\nSpinage seed should be got ready to be sown in September, if you wish\r\na good supply of this choicest of all spring greens.\r\n\r\nCelery plants will begin to grow strongly in the trenches; water with\r\nliquid manure; if troubled with insects, dust with quick lime and\r\nwater with salt water. Above all things be careful in drawing in the\r\nearth to keep it out from the heart of the plant, and let it be done\r\nin dry weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPULLING OFF POTATO BLOSSOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Boston Cultivator_, speaking of this process, says: “As the\r\nqualities of the potato-ball or apple differ considerably from the\r\nroot or tuber, it may be that the juices destined to nourish the balls\r\nwill not, on removing the blossoms, go to increase the roots. This\r\nview is not unreasonable.”\r\n\r\nWe do not suppose the theory to be, that the sap tending to the bloom\r\nand ball _returns_ to the root. But, simply, that there will be so\r\nmuch less food to be prepared, and therefore so much less exhaustion\r\nto the vegetable economy. It is well known that the filling out and\r\nripening of seeds is eminently exhausting to the plant. It has long\r\nbeen the custom of florists who wish show-flowers, to refuse their\r\nbulbous plants leave to bloom for one season, plucking off the bud,\r\nthat they might be so much the stronger for the next year’s blooming.\r\n\r\nBut we suppose the truth to be this. The sap is prepared in the leaf\r\nand enters the distributing vessels of the plant. It is conveyed to\r\nevery organ; each part, receiving its portion, _modifies it by a\r\nfarther chemical action peculiar to itself_. Thus in the case of an\r\napple-tree. The elaborated sap which goes to the leaf, the alburnum,\r\nthe liber, the blossom, the fruit is the same in all; but the fruit\r\ngives it a still further elaboration, by which it imparts the peculiar\r\nproperties belonging to it, in distinction from the tissues; so of the\r\nbark, the blossom, etc. If, then, the seed-vessels are removed, so\r\nmuch less elaborated sap is consumed as they would have required; and\r\nthis, or at least, portions of it, are given to the other parts of the\r\nvegetable economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLADING AND TOPPING CORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one performs these operations for the benefit of the ear, but to\r\nobtain fodder, and it is then justified on the ground that the corn is\r\nnot harmed by it. The sap drawn from the root does not flow straight\r\nup into the ear and kernel, but into the _leaves_ or blades. The\r\ncarbonic acid of the crude sap is decomposed, oxygen is given off and\r\ncarbon remains in the form of starch, sugar, gum, etc., etc.,\r\naccording to the nature of the plant. When sap has by exposure to\r\nlight undergone this change it is said to be _elaborated_.\r\n\r\nIt is only now that the sap, passing from the upper side of the leaf\r\nto a set of vessels in the under side, is reconveyed to the stem,\r\nbegins to descend, and is distributed to various parts of the plant,\r\naffording nourishment to all. But when the fruit of every plant is\r\nmaturing, it draws to itself a large part of the prepared sap, which,\r\nwhen it has entered the kernel, is still farther elaborated, and made\r\nto produce the peculiar qualities of the fruit, whether corn or wheat,\r\napple or pear. It is plain from this explanation that a plant stripped\r\nof its leaves is like a chemist robbed of his laboratory, or like a\r\nman without lungs.\r\n\r\nIf corn is needed for fodder, let it be cut close to the ground when\r\nthe corn has glazed. The grain will go on ripening and be as heavy and\r\nas good as if left to stand, and the stalk will afford excellent food\r\nfor cattle. Sheep are fond of corn thus cured, and will winter very\r\nwell upon it. In husking out the corn, the husk should be left on the\r\nstalk for fodder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPLE-SUGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs most persons who have not informed themselves on the subject,\r\nimagine that we are indebted to cane-sugar for our main supply, and\r\nthat maple-sugar is a petty neighborhood matter, not worth the figures\r\nemployed to represent it, we propose to spend some space in stating\r\nthe truth on this matter. We will exhibit, 1, the amount produced; 2,\r\nthe proper way of manufacturing it; 3, the proper treatment of\r\nsugar-tree groves.\r\n\r\nWe shall confine our statistics to the most important Northern and\r\nWestern States.\r\n\r\n  1. New York produces annually                  10,048,109 lbs.\r\n  2. Ohio                                         6,363,386  “\r\n  3. Vermont                                      4,647,934  “\r\n  4. Indiana                                      3,727,795  “\r\n  5. Pennsylvania                                 2,265,755  “\r\n  6. New Hampshire                                1,162,368  “\r\n  7. Virginia                                     1,541,833  “\r\n  8. Kentucky                                     1,377,835  “\r\n  9. Michigan                                     1,329,784  “\r\n                                              ---------------\r\n  Total Of nine States                           22,464,799  “\r\n\r\n  Residue thus—add for Maine, Massachusetts,\r\n    Connecticut, Maryland, Tennessee, Illinois,\r\n    Iowa, Missouri and Wisconsin                  2,030,853  “\r\n                                            ---------------\r\n                                                 24,495,652  “\r\n\r\nSomething should be subtracted for beet-root and cornstalk-sugar. But\r\non the other hand, the statistics are so much below the truth on\r\nmaple-sugar, that the deficiency may be set off against beet-root and\r\ncornstalk-sugar. That the figures do not more than represent the\r\namount of _maple-sugar_ produced in these States may be presumed from\r\none case. Indiana is set down at 3,727,795; but in the four counties\r\nof Washington, Warrick, Posey and Harrison, no account seems to have\r\nbeen taken of this article. In Marion county, four of the first\r\nsugar-making townships, Warren, Lawrence, Centre and Franklin, are not\r\nreckoned. If we suppose these four townships to average as much as the\r\nothers in Marion county, they produced 77,648 lbs., and instead of\r\nputting Marion county down at 97,064 it should be 174,712 lbs. It is\r\napparent from this case, that in Indiana the estimate is far below the\r\ntruth; and if it is half as much so in the other eight States\r\nenumerated,[7] then 22,464,799 is not more than a fair expression of\r\nthe _maple-sugar_ alone.\r\n\r\nLousiana is the first sugar-growing State in the Union. Her produce,\r\nby the statistics of 1840, was 119,947,720, or nearly one hundred and\r\ntwenty million pounds. The States of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,\r\nSouth Carolina and Florida, together, add only 645,281 pounds more.\r\n\r\n  Cane-sugar in the United States 120,593,001 lbs.\r\n  Maple  “     “          “        24,495,652  “\r\n\r\nThus about one-sixth of the sugar made annually in the United States\r\nis made from the maple-tree.[8] It is to be remembered too that in\r\nLouisiana it is _the_ staple, while at the North maple-sugar has never\r\nbeen manufactured with any considerable skill, or regarded as a\r\nregular crop, but only a temporary device of economy. Now it only\r\nneeds to be understood that maple-sugar may be made so as to have the\r\nflavor of the best cane-sugar, and that it may, at a trifling expense,\r\nbe refined to white sugar, and the manufacture of it will become more\r\ngeneral, more skillful, and may, in a little time, entirely supersede\r\nthe necessity of importing cane-sugar. Indiana stands fourth in the\r\nrank of maple-sugar making States. Her annual product is at least\r\n_four million pounds_, which, at six cents the pound amounts to\r\n$160,000 per annum. A little exertion would quickly run up the annual\r\nvalue of her home-made sugar to half a million dollars.\r\n\r\nMaple-sugar now only brings about two-thirds the price of New Orleans.\r\nThe fault is in the manufacturing of it. The saccharine principle of\r\nthe _cane and tree are exactly the same_. If the same care were\r\nemployed in their manufacture they would be indistinguishable; and\r\nmaple-sugar would be as salable as New Orleans, and if afforded at a\r\nless price, might supplant it in the market. The average quantity of\r\nsugar consumed in England by each individual is about thirty pounds\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\nMAPLE-SUGAR MAKING.—Greater care must be taken in collecting the sap.\r\nOld, and half-decayed wooden-troughs, with a liberal infusion of\r\nleaves, dirt, etc., impart great impurity to the water. Rain-water,\r\ndecayed vegetable matter, etc., add _chemical_ ingredients to the sap,\r\ntroublesome to extract, and injuring the quality if not removed. The\r\nexpense of clean vessels may be a little more, but with care, it could\r\nbe more than made up in the quality of the sugar. Many are now using\r\nearthen-crocks. These are cheap, easily cleaned, and every way\r\ndesirable, with the single exception of breakage. But if wood-troughs\r\nare used, let them be kept scrupulously clean.\r\n\r\nThe kettles should be scoured thoroughly before use, and kept\r\nconstantly clean. If rusty, or foul, or coated with burnt sugar,\r\nneither the color nor flavor can be perfect. Vinegar and sand have\r\nbeen used by experienced sugar-makers to scour the kettles with. It is\r\nbest to have, at least, three to a range.\r\n\r\nAll vegetable juices contain _acids_, and acids resist the process of\r\ncrystallization.\r\n\r\nDr. J. C. Jackson[9] directs the one-_measured ounce_ (one-fourth of a\r\ngill) of pure lime-water to be added to every gallon of sap. This\r\nneutralizes the acid, and not only facilitates the granulation, but\r\ngives sugar in a free state, now too generally acid and deliquescent,\r\nbesides being charged with salts of the oxide of iron, insomuch that\r\nit ordinarily strikes a black color with tea.\r\n\r\nThe process of making a pure white sugar is simple and unexpensive.\r\nThe lime added to the sap, combining with the peculiar acid of the\r\nmaple, forms a neutral salt; this salt is found to be easily soluble\r\nin alcohol. Dr. Jackson recommends the following process. Procure\r\nsheet-iron _cones_, with an aperture at the small end or apex—let them\r\nbe coated with white-lead and boiled linseed-oil, and thoroughly\r\ndried, so that no part can come off. [We do not know why earthen\r\ncones, unglazed and painted, would not answer equally well, besides\r\nbeing much cheaper.] Let the sugar be put into these cones, stopping\r\nthe hole in the lower end until it is entirely cool. Then remove the\r\nstopper, and pour upon the base a quantity of strong whisky or\r\nfourth-proof rum[10]—allow this to filtrate through until the sugar is\r\nwhite. When the loaf is dried it will be pure white sugar, with the\r\nexception of the alcohol. To get rid of this, dissolve the sugar in\r\npure boiling hot-water, and let it evaporate until it is dense enough\r\nto crystallize. Then put it again into the cone-moulds and let it\r\nharden. The dribblets which come away from the cone while the whisky\r\nis draining, may be used for making vinegar. It is sometimes the case\r\nthat whisky would, if freely used in a sugar camp, go off in a wrong\r\ndirection, benefiting neither the sugar nor the sugar-maker. If, on\r\nthis account, any prefer another mode, let them make a _saturated_\r\nsolution of loaf-sugar, and pour it in place of the whisky upon the\r\nbase of the cones. Although the sugar will not be quite as white, the\r\ndrainings will form an excellent molasses, whereas the _drainings_ by\r\nthe former method are good only for vinegar.\r\n\r\nCARE OF SUGAR ORCHARDS.—It is grievous to witness the waste committed\r\nupon valuable groves of sugar-trees. If the special object was to\r\ndestroy them, it could hardly be better reached than by the methods\r\nnow employed. The holes are carelessly made, and often the abominable\r\npractice is seen of cutting channels in the tree with an axe. The man\r\nwho will murder his trees in this tomahawk and scalping-knife manner,\r\nis just the man that Æsop meant when he made the fable of a fellow who\r\nkilled his goose to get at once all the golden eggs. With good care,\r\nand allowing them occasionally a year of rest, a sugar-grove may last\r\nfor centuries.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible get your sugar-tree grove laid down to grass,\r\nclear out underbrush, thin out timber and useless trees. Trees in open\r\nland make about _six pounds_ of sugar, and forest trees only about\r\n_four_ pounds to the season. As the maple is peculiarly rich in potash\r\n(four-fifths of potash exported is made from sugar-maple), it is\r\nevident that it requires that substance in the soil. Upon this account\r\nwe should advise a liberal use of wood-ashes upon the soil of\r\nsugar-groves.\r\n\r\nTAPPING TREES.—Two taps are usually enough—never more than three. For\r\nthough as many as twenty-four have been inserted at once without\r\nkilling the tree, regard ought to be had to the use of the tree\r\nthrough a long series of years. At first bore about two inches; after\r\nten or twelve days remove the tap and go one or two inches deeper. By\r\nthis method more sap will be obtained than by going down to the\r\ncolored wood at first. We state upon the authority of William Tripure,\r\na Shaker of Canterbury, N. H., that about seven pounds of sugar may be\r\nmade from a barrel of twenty gallons, or four pounds the tree for\r\nforest trees; and two men and one boy will tend a thousand trees,\r\nmaking 4,000 pounds of sugar.\r\n\r\nWe would recommend the setting of pasture-lands, and road-sides of the\r\nfarm with sugar-maple trees. Their growth is rapid, and no tree\r\ncombines more valuable properties. It is a beautiful shade-tree, it is\r\nexcellent for fuel, it is much used for manufacturing purposes, its\r\nashes are valuable for potash, and its sap is rich in sugar. There are\r\ntwenty-seven species of the maple known, twelve of them are indigenous\r\nto this continent. All of these have a sacharine sap, but only two, to\r\na degree sufficient for practical purposes, viz., _Acer saccharinum_\r\nor the common sugar-maple, and _Acer nigrum_ or the _black_\r\nsugar-maple. The sap of these contains about half as much sugar as the\r\njuice of the sugar-cane. One gallon of pasture maple sap contains, on\r\nan average, 3,451 grains of sugar; and one gallon of cane juice (in\r\nJamaica), averages 7,000 grains of sugar.\r\n\r\nBut the cane is subject to the necessity of annual and careful\r\ncultivation, and its manufacture is comparatively expensive and\r\ndifficult. Whereas the maple is a permanent tree, requires no\r\ncultivation, may be raised on the borders of farms without taking up\r\nground, and its sap is easily convertible into sugar, and if carefully\r\nmade, into sugar as good as cane-sugar can be. Add to the above\r\nconsiderations that the sugar-making period is a time of comparative\r\nleisure with the farmer, and the motives for attention to this subject\r\nof domestic sugar-making seem to be complete.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nLETTUCE.—Those who wish fine _head_ lettuce should prepare a rich,\r\nmellow bed of light soil; tough and compact soil will not give them\r\nany growth. In transplanting, let there be at least one foot between\r\neach plant. Stir the ground often. If it is very dry weather, water at\r\nevening _copiously_, if you water at all; but the _hoe_ is the only\r\nwatering-pot for a garden, if thereby the soil is kept loose and fine.\r\nWe have raised heads nearly as large as a drum-head cabbage by this\r\nmethod, very brittle, sweet and tender withal.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [7] Dr. J. C. Jackson puts Vermont at 6,000,000 lbs. per\r\n     annum, while the census only gives about 4,000,000.\r\n\r\n     [8] The data of these calculations, it must be confessed,\r\n     are _very_ uncertain, and conclusions drawn from them as to\r\n     the relative amounts of sugar produced in different States,\r\n     are to be regarded, at the very best, as problematical. We\r\n     extract the following remarks from an article in the\r\n     _Western Literary Journal_, from the pen of Charles Cist, an\r\n     able statistical writer:\r\n\r\n     “It is not my purpose to go into an extended notice of the\r\n     errors in the statistics connected with the census of 1840.\r\n     A few examples will serve to show their character and\r\n     extent. In the article of hemp, Ohio is stated to produce\r\n     9,080 tons, and Indiana 8,605—either equal nearly to the\r\n     product of Kentucky, which is reported at 9,992 tons, and\r\n     almost equal, when united, to Missouri, to which 18,010 tons\r\n     are given as the aggregate. Virginia is stated to raise\r\n     25,594 tons, almost equal to both Kentucky and Missouri,\r\n     which are given as above at 28,002 tons. Now the\r\n     indisputable fact is, that Kentucky and Missouri produce\r\n     more hemp than all the rest of the United States, and ten\r\n     times as much as either Ohio, Indiana, or Virginia, which\r\n     three States are made to raise 50 per centum more than those\r\n     two great hemp-producing States.\r\n\r\n     “The sugar of Louisiana is given at 119,947,720 lbs., equal\r\n     to 120,000 hhds., 160 per cent. more than has been published\r\n     in New Orleans, as the highest product of the five\r\n     consecutive years, including and preceding 1840.\r\n\r\n     “But what is this to the wholesale figure-dealing which\r\n     returns 3,160,949 tons of hay, as the product of New York\r\n     for that article! a quantity sufficient to winter all the\r\n     horses and mules in the United States.\r\n\r\n     “Other errors of great magnitude might be pointed out; such\r\n     as making the tobacco product of Virginia 11,000 hhds., when\r\n     her inspection records show 55,000 hhds., thrown into market\r\n     as the crop of that year. Who believes that 12,233 lbs.\r\n     pitch, rosin and turpentine, or the tenth part of that\r\n     quantity, were manufactured in Louisiana in 1840, or that\r\n     New York produced 10,093,991 lbs. maple-sugar in a single\r\n     year, or twenty such statements equally absurd, which I\r\n     might take from the returns?”\r\n\r\n     Mr. Cist will find in the appendix to Dr. Jackson’s Final\r\n     Report on the Geology of New Hampshire, a statement, that\r\n     Vermont makes 6,000,000 pounds of sugar annually. If this be\r\n     so, we may, without extravagance, suppose that New York\r\n     reaches 10,000,000 lbs. So far as we have collateral means\r\n     of judging, the amount of maple-sugar is _under_-stated in\r\n     the census of 1840.\r\n\r\n     [9] Appendix to final Report on the Geology and Mineralogy\r\n     of New Hampshire, page 361. This admirable Report is an able\r\n     exposition of the benefit of public State surveys.\r\n\r\n     [10] If those who drink whisky would pour it on to the sugar\r\n     in the refining cones, instead of upon sugar in tumblers, it\r\n     would refine _them_ as much as it does the sugar; performing\r\n     two valuable processes at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DEFINITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany terms, in general use among scientific men, and usually employed\r\nin agricultural works, are obscure to young readers. For their sakes\r\nwe will explain some of them; and shall not be angry if _old_ men\r\nprofit by the explanation.\r\n\r\nSOIL.—The surface-earth, of whatever ingredients it may be composed.\r\nIt may be a clay-soil, a sand-soil, a calcareous soil, as the surface\r\nis composed of clay, or sand, or clay strongly mixed with lime, etc.\r\n\r\nSUBSOIL.—The earth lying below the ordinary depth to which the plow or\r\nspade penetrate. Sometimes it has hardened by the running of the plow\r\nover it for a series of years; then it is called _pan_, as hard-pan,\r\nclay-pan, etc. It is sometimes of the same nature as the top-soil, as\r\nin clay-lands; in others it is a different earth; as when a coarse\r\ngravel underlies vegetable mold, or when clay lies beneath sandy soil.\r\n\r\nSUBSOIL PLOWING.—In ordinary plowing, the share runs from five to\r\nseven inches deep. A plow has been constructed (called subsoil plow),\r\nto follow in the furrow, and break up from six to eight inches\r\ndeeper—so that the whole plowing penetrates from ten to sixteen\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nSUBSOIL PLOW.—A plow having a narrow “_double share_, or a small share\r\non each side of the coulter, and no mold-board.” It is designed to\r\nbreak up and soften the subsoil, but not to bring it up to the top.\r\n\r\nMOLD.—A soil in which decayed vegetable matter largely predominates\r\nover _earths_. Thus, leaf-mold is soil _principally_ composed of\r\nrotten leaves; dung-mold, of dung reduced to a fine powdery matter;\r\nheath-mold, a black vegetable soil found in heath-lands; peat-mold,\r\nforest-mold, garden-mold, etc.\r\n\r\nLOAM.—Clay, or any of the primitive earths, reduced to a mellow,\r\nfriable state by intermixture of _sand_, or vegetable matter, is\r\ncalled loam. Clay lands well manured with sand, dung, or muck, are\r\nturned, gradually, to a loam.\r\n\r\nARGILLACEOUS.—From the Latin (_argillaceus_,) soil principally\r\ncomposed of clay.\r\n\r\nALUMINA OR ALUMINE.—Generally employed to signify _pure_ clay. It is,\r\nchemically speaking, a metallic oxide; _aluminium_ is the metallic\r\n_base_, and is an elementary substance.\r\n\r\nIt is generally known that the _diamond_ is pure carbon (charcoal is\r\ncarbon in an impure state), but it is not as generally known that the\r\n_ruby_ and the _sapphire_, “two of the most beautiful gems with which\r\nwe are acquainted, are composed almost solely of alumina,” or pure\r\nclay in a crystallized state.\r\n\r\nSILICIOUS.—An earth composed largely of silex. _Silex_ or _silica_ is\r\nconsidered to be a primitive earth constituting flint, and containing\r\nmost kinds of sands, and sandstones, etc. China or porcelain, ware is\r\nformed from silica and alumina united, _i. e._ from silicious sand and\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nCALCAREOUS.—A soil into the composition of which lime enters largely.\r\nLimestone lands are calcareous. Pure clay manured freely with marl\r\nbecomes calcareous, for marl is, mostly, clay and carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nALLUVIAL.—Strictly speaking, alluvium or our alluvial soil, is a soil\r\nformed by causes yet in existence. Thus a bottom-land is formed by the\r\nwash of a river. It is usually a mixture of decayed vegetable matter\r\nand sand.\r\n\r\nDILUVIAL.—A diluvial soil or deposit is one formed by causes no longer\r\nin existence. Thus a deposit by a deluge is termed _diluvial_. The\r\nword is derived from the Latin (_diluvium_), signifying a deluge.\r\n\r\nThe terms argillaceous, calcareous, silicious, alluvial and diluvial\r\nare constantly employed in all works which treat of husbandry.\r\n\r\nFRIABLE.—A friable soil is one which crumbles easily. Clay is\r\n_adhesive_, or in common language _clammy_: leaf-mold is friable, or\r\ncrumbling. Clay becomes friable when, by exposure to air or frost, or\r\nby addition of sand, vegetable matter, etc., it is thoroughly\r\nmellowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINING WET LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore many years there will be thousands of acres pierced with\r\ndrains. But the inducements to it which make it wise in England and\r\nNew England do not yet, generally, exist in the West. The expense of\r\ndraining one acre would buy two. Many farmers have already more arable\r\nland than they can till to advantage. Land redeemed from slough would\r\nnot pay for itself in many years.\r\n\r\nBut although a general introduction of draining would not be wise,\r\nthere are many cases in which, to a limited extent, it should be\r\npractised. Lands lying near to cities are sufficiently valuable, and\r\nthe market for farming products sure enough, to justify the reclaiming\r\nof wet pieces of land. On small farms of forty and eighty acres,\r\nsurrounded by high-priced lands, not easily procured for enlarging his\r\nfarm if the owner should wish it, draining might be employed with\r\nadvantage. A man with a _small_ farm can _afford_ expenses for high\r\ncultivation which would break a _large_ farmer.\r\n\r\nSome times a large meadow or arable field is marred by a wet slash\r\nthrough the middle of it; a farmer would not begrudge the labor of\r\ndraining for the sake of having his favorite field without a blemish.\r\nSometimes farms are intersected by wet lands, which make the passage\r\nfrom one part of the farm to another difficult at all times, and\r\nalmost impassable at some seasons of the year. Draining might be\r\nresorted to in such a case, not so much for the sake of the land\r\nreclaimed, as for the convenience of the whole farm.\r\n\r\nWe know pieces of wet, peaty meadow land lying close by the\r\nfarm-house, the only drawback to the beauty of the place. A good\r\nfarmer would wish to recover such a spot for the same reason that he\r\nwould prefer a handsome house to a homely one—a fine horse over a\r\ncoarse-looking animal—a sightly fence, rather than a clumsy one. There\r\nis much strong land—but high, flat, and cold—which is wet through all\r\nthe spring, resisting seed till long after other portions of the farm\r\nare at work, and which would, but for this backwardness, be regarded\r\nas the best land. If without great expense, such land could be cured,\r\nfew farmers would mind the trouble or labor.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of draining which may be employed according to\r\ncircumstances—subsoil-plowing, furrow-draining and ditch-draining.\r\nWhen a soil is underbound by a compact, impervious _subsoil_, all the\r\nrain or melting snow is retained in the soil until it can _exhale_ and\r\nevaporate. For the subsoil acts like a water-tight floor, or the\r\nbottom of a tub. Subsoil-plowing, by thoroughly working through this\r\nunder crust, gives a downward passage to the moisture; water sinks as\r\nit does in sandy loams. Nor will such treatment be less useful to\r\nprevent the injury of summer drought; for the depth of soil affords a\r\nharbor for roots from whence they can draw moisture when the top-soil\r\nis dry as ashes.\r\n\r\nBut there is a limit put to this treatment by the amount of clay\r\ncontained in the subsoil. It has been experimentally ascertained in\r\nEngland, that when the soil contains as high as forty-three per cent\r\nof alumina (clay) sub-soil-plowing is useless, because the clay soon\r\n_coalesces_ and is as impervious as ever. In such cases, if the land\r\nhas a slight inclination in any direction, furrow-draining may, in\r\nsome measure, relieve it. The ground is marked out in lands as for\r\nsowing grain and plowed with back-furrows, throwing the earth toward\r\nthe centre. The rain and snow will run to either side, and flow off by\r\nthe channels left between each strip. This treatment does not relieve\r\nthe land, to any great extent, of water contained in it, but acts as a\r\npreventive, by carrying off the rain and snow before they are absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO DEAR! SHALL WE EVER BE DONE LYING?\r\n\r\n\r\nAn honest old gentleman, in telling us his troubles, gave great\r\nprominence to the necessity he was frequently under of disappointing\r\nhis customers, whose work could not be finished as soon as he had\r\npromised. After explaining the difficulty, he looked up with great\r\nearnestness, and exclaimed, “_O dear! shall we ever be done with this\r\nlying?_”\r\n\r\nWe have often wondered ourselves whether such a consummation would\r\never take place. “Your boots shall be done on Saturday night without\r\nfail.” Nevertheless, you have to go to church with gaping shoes for\r\nwant of them. “Your coat shall be sent home by nine o’clock on\r\nSaturday night;” and you get it, in fact, the Wednesday after. “Will\r\nyou lend me your wheel-barrow? I will return it to-night.” You wait\r\nfor it till next week, and then _send_ for it. My carpenter solemnly\r\nagreed to finish my house by November; but it was July before I could\r\nget the key. My wood was to be split on Saturday afternoon—enough for\r\nthe Sabbath; so it was—but I had to do it. My money was to be paid me\r\nthe next week; and then, _next_ week; and then, NEXT week—and _then_,\r\nas soon as he could get it; he did get it and spent it; and then it\r\nshould be paid when he got it again—he got it again, and paid another\r\ndebt because the man treated him more savagely than I would. The\r\nstrength laid out in running for this money, if it had been\r\neconomically applied to labor, would, nearly, have _earned_ the whole\r\ndebt. The fellow never paid me at last; but Death came along, and he\r\npaid him promptly. “O dear! shall we ever get done with this lying?”\r\nIt is one of the few domestic manufactures which need no protection,\r\nand flourishes without benefit either to the producer or consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF STOCK IN WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no better sign of careful husbandry can be found than in the\r\nattention paid to brute animals. We always expect a thriftless fellow\r\nto neglect and abuse his stock. When we see them well cared for, we\r\nalways judge the owner to be a good farmer. Cattle ranging out often\r\nhave had good picking, and if partly fed at the rack, will come out in\r\nthe spring well-conditioned. Where hay and grain are a drug, we\r\nsuppose that all cautions about wasting them will be laughed at.\r\n_Care_ and _economy_ are not the peculiar features of western farming;\r\nprofusion and easiness are the more characteristic. But there are some\r\npoints of attention to which every farmer should give heed.\r\n\r\nCLEANING THE STABLE.—When cattle lie out, this trouble is saved in\r\ntheir case. But it is almost universally the practice to let the\r\nmanure accumulate in stables for horses from autumn to spring, and\r\nsometimes from year to year, until its quantity compels its removal.\r\nThis is all well enough for the sake of the manure—it is sheltered,\r\nand its strength preserved. But it is at the expense of the horse. The\r\nconcentrated effluvia is bad; and lying down upon manure, night after\r\nnight, causes the skin to break out in blotches; and sometimes the\r\nwhole ham is affected so much that the hair comes off, and the skin is\r\ninflamed and covered with running sores. The ammonia of urine (which\r\nabounds in horse manure), is caustic, and acts upon the skin like a\r\nblister upon the human flesh. If Providence had ordained that a sore\r\nshould break out on the owner, for every one on his stock occasioned\r\nby his negligence, animals would have a much better time than they now\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nCOWS WITH CALF.—Especial attention should be paid to these. As they\r\ngrow heavy, toward spring, they should not be chased by horses or\r\ndogs, or beaten by unmannerly boys and men. Their food should be\r\nabundant and nutritious. A cow brought to calving in spring in a very\r\nthin and lean condition will not recover through the whole summer, no\r\nmatter how carefully tended. The cow, the calf, and your own profit in\r\nboth, require that you should bring your cows to the spring in\r\nfirst-rate condition. If you have _roots_, feed them; but if not, give\r\na slop of shorts, meal, and flax-seed cake. This last ingredient is\r\neminently serviceable in laying on flesh.\r\n\r\nMILKING COWS.—Let them be milked regularly without regard to weather.\r\nA careless girl will, if not watched, milk irregularly, and what is\r\nworse, leave the cow _unstript_. The morning work presses, or the cold\r\npinches, or she is in haste, at night, to go a visiting, or some one\r\nof a hundred other reasons tempt her to milk out the full flow, and\r\nleave the strippings. A cow so abused will be injured, in a short\r\ntime, so much, that all the care in the world will not bring her back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSee that stock are treated with gentleness and patience. It is a shame\r\nto abuse a kind and docile animal, and it is useless to thrash those\r\nthat are not so. In either case, kindness is the best policy. A man\r\nwho is brutal to cattle is more of a beast than they are. We have seen\r\nmany a man who, if he had two more legs, would not fetch the price of\r\na stock-hog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEP PLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe saw recently a potato which grew at the depth of _twenty-five feet_\r\nbelow the surface of the earth. This is an extraordinary depth. Few\r\nthings planted at that depth would vegetate. The fact in this case is\r\nunquestionable. The top was terminated by a cluster of _blossoms_, and\r\nthe potatoes were of the size of small hickory-nuts.\r\n\r\nP. S. Another fact, which like to have been omitted in this account,\r\nis, that it grew at the bottom of an _open well_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN AND MILLET FOR FODDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of sowing grains for fodder has been practised with great\r\nsuccess. MILLET is sown in May, June, or July, at the rate of three\r\npecks of seed to the acre. It is, usually, ready for the scythe in\r\nabout ninety days. Thick sowing is best. Cut when the grain is fairly\r\nout of the milk, and cure it like hay. Four tons is a fair yield—two\r\ntons is a small crop.\r\n\r\nINDIAN CORN should be sown broadcast at the rate of four to five\r\nbushels to the acre. Corn belongs to the tribe of _grasses_.\r\nCultivating it for the grain, in rows, with every stimulant of air,\r\nlight, and manure, develops the stalk almost to a tree form. When sown\r\nfor fodder, the object should be to produce it, as nearly as possible,\r\nlike a _grass_. Thick sowing will tend to do it, and each stalk being\r\nsmall and tender, the crop will be easily masticated by cattle. By\r\ngood management six or eight tons may be cut to the acre—cutting twice\r\nin the season. The first mowing should be about the period of\r\n_silking_. The next, whenever the shoots have grown again to a proper\r\nsize. If but one mowing is intended, it should be permitted to stand a\r\nweek or two later than when two crops are to be taken. For, all plants\r\nprepare the most of nutritious juices at the period of their\r\n_fruiting_. Indian corn is the richest in saccharine matter at about\r\nthe time its grain is turning from a milky to a mealy state. Cattle\r\nwill eat either of the above grains, treated like a grass crop, with\r\ngreat avidity; and every one knows that it is desirable to give them a\r\n_change_ of food through the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED SAVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seeds of cucumber, melon, etc., are better, at any rate, when four\r\nof five years old than when fresh; and we have well authenticated\r\ninstances of seeds retaining their vitality much longer than this.\r\nThere is _no_ fixed period during which seeds will keep. There is no\r\nreason to suppose that they would lose their vitality in any\r\nassignable number of years _if the proper conditions were observed_.\r\nDe Candolle says that M. Gerardin raised kidney beans, obtained from\r\nTournefort’s herbarium, which were at least a hundred years old; but\r\nbeans left to the chances of the atmosphere are not good the second\r\nyear, and hardly worth planting in the third. Professor Lindley raised\r\nraspberry plants from seed not less than sixteen or seventeen hundred\r\nyears old. Multitudes of other instances might be given. In reply to\r\nthe first question, it may, then, be said, that the length of time\r\nthrough which seeds will keep depends upon the method of preserving\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe do not suppose it to be essential to inclose apple, pear, and\r\nquince seeds in earth for the purpose of preserving their vitality\r\nduring a single winter. But if exposed to the air, the rind becomes so\r\nhard and rigid as to make germination very difficult from mere\r\nmechanical reasons. The moisture of the soil keeps the covering in a\r\ntender state, and it is easily ruptured by the expansion of the seed.\r\n\r\nThe shell of peach, plum, and other stone-fruit seeds would form, if\r\nleft to dry and harden, a yet more hopeless prison. If kept for two\r\nyears, the most stone-fruit pips, it is to be presumed, would not\r\ngerminate. Some, however, would have vigor enough to grow even then.\r\nWe have forgotten who it was, but believe it to have been a reliable\r\nperson, recently mentioned the fact, that a peach or apricot stone was\r\nfor several years kept as a child’s play-thing; but upon being\r\nplanted, grew, and is now a healthy tree. Such cases are, however,\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse between Great Britain and her distant colonies, and\r\nthe various expeditions fitted out from her shores for purposes of\r\nbotanical research and for the acquisition of new plants from distant\r\nregions, have made the subject of seed-saving at sea a matter of much\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nIn general, the conditions of preservation are three; a low\r\ntemperature, dryness, and exclusion of air. But it often happens, that\r\nall these cannot be had, and then a choice must be made between them.\r\nHeat and moisture will either germinate the seeds or corrupt them. In\r\nlong voyages, and in warm regions, _moisture contained in the seed_,\r\nif in a close bottle, is sufficient to destroy the seed. Glass bottles\r\nhave therefore been rejected. Seeds for long voyages, or for long\r\npreservation, are thoroughly ripened and thoroughly dried; but dried\r\nwithout raising the _temperature_ of the air, as this would impair\r\ntheir vitality. They are then wrapped in coarse paper, and put,\r\nloosely, in a coarse canvas bag, and hung up in a cool and airy place.\r\nIn this way seeds will be as nearly secure from heat and\r\nmoisture—their two worst enemies—as may be. It is probable that some\r\nseeds have but a short period of vitality under any circumstances of\r\npreservation. Seeds containing much oil, are peculiarly liable to\r\nspoil. Lindley suggests that the oil becomes rancid.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of seeds from one season to another, for home use, is\r\nnot difficult, and may be described in three sentences: ripen them\r\nwell, dry them thoroughly, and keep them aired and cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRHUBARB.\r\n\r\n\r\nRhubarb or _pie-plant_ is becoming as indispensable to the garden as\r\ncorn, or potatoes, or tomatoes. No family should be without it. It\r\ncomes in after winter apples are gone and before green apples come in\r\nagain for tarts. By a little attention it may be had from the last of\r\nMarch through the whole summer. Indeed, it may be had through the\r\nwhole year. The root contains within itself all the nourishment\r\nrequired to develop the leaves and stalks at first, without any other\r\naid than warmth and moisture. If then it be lifted late in the fall or\r\nduring open weather in winter, and put in large pots, nail kegs,\r\nboxes, etc., put in a warm room, or cellar, it will soon send up a\r\nsupply of leaves. It is not even necessary that there should be much\r\nlight, for the want of it only makes the stem whiter and of a milder\r\nacid. The roots thus used may either be thrown away, or set out again\r\nand not used until they have recovered, which will be in about one\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nFor early spring use, select a warm spot in the garden, and late in\r\nthe fall dig in around your roots a good supply of rotten manure.\r\nCover them with coarse manure, straw, or litter. As soon as the frost\r\ncomes out of the ground, knock out the ends of a barrel and put one\r\nover each plant from which you propose to gain an early supply. Put a\r\nquantity of coarse manure around the outside of the barrel to maintain\r\nthe warmth, and, in cold nights and during cold rains, lay a board\r\nover the open top. Thus treated, you may have tarts in March. But the\r\nmain supply of this wholesome plant is to arise from open cultivation.\r\nThe roots may be gained from seed or from division of old roots.\r\nEastern writers recommend sowing the seed in autumn; but in the West\r\nspring sowings have vegetated much better than an autumnal planting.\r\nIn April sow the seed in deep mellow and rich beds. Keep the plants\r\nfree from weeds and in a growing state during the summer. They may\r\nrequire a little shading during the hottest days of summer. The next\r\nspring we transplant them to a trial-bed; for, it is to be remembered,\r\nthat the seed does not necessarily give a plant like its parent. Let\r\nthem be set two feet apart every way, and during the season it can be\r\nseen which are the largest and best; these are to be raised in the\r\nfall, divided and transplanted, and the rest thrown away. Out of a\r\nhundred plants, not more than two or three may be worth keeping. In\r\nthe spring of 1842 we planted seed obtained in New York, for the\r\nVictoria Rhubarb (a new kind), which had been imported but a few\r\nmonths. Of fifty plants only three proved worth keeping—one of these\r\nfor its earliness and the others for size.\r\n\r\nWhen you have secured roots from which you wish to form a bed for your\r\nmain supply, divide them either in the fall or spring into as many\r\npieces as there are buds on the crown, each piece having, of course, a\r\nbud. The smallest slice of root will live, although a large portion is\r\npreferable. Do not be too timid in dividing; the plant is exceedingly\r\ntenacious of life—it can hardly be killed. We have had roots lying in\r\nthe open air for weeks, and when replanted growing with undiminished\r\nvigor. Every one who has, for a single season, tended a garden, knows\r\nwhat _dock_ is, and how tenacious of life, so much so, as to make it\r\nquite a trouble. The rhubarb is a full-blooded vegetable brother,\r\nbelonging to the same family of plants.\r\n\r\nThis plant thrives most luxuriantly in a rich, sandy loam; the earth\r\nshould be spaded and mellowed to at least twenty inches depth. We\r\nprepare ground for it as follows: Mark out the row with a line, throw\r\nout the top earth on one side; throw out a full spade depth of subsoil\r\nupon the other side. Throw back the top dirt, mixing it freely with\r\nwell rotted manure. Now put in the soil which was taken from the\r\nbottom of the trench; as this is comparatively poor—mix it largely\r\nwith manure. We make rows four feet apart, and set the plants three\r\nfeet apart in the row. Very little care is needed in after\r\ncultivation. The large leaves will shade the ground and check weeds. A\r\ngood supply of fresh manure, well dug in once a year, will keep the\r\nplants in heart and health for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeas should be planted among the earliest of seeds. They are a hardy\r\nvegetable, and will bear severe frosts in the spring without injury. A\r\nlight, sandy soil is the best. If manured, let only the most\r\nthoroughly rotted be used. Two sorts of peas are sufficient for all\r\nordinary purposes—one early kind, and one for the later and main\r\nsupply. The number of kinds advertised by seedsmen is very great, and\r\nevery year adds to the new varieties. Many of them are of little\r\nvalue, and many, hitherto esteemed, are supplanted by better ones. The\r\nEarly Warwick and Cedo Nulli are fine early peas, unsurpassed till the\r\nPrince Albert appeared. This is now esteemed the earliest of peas,\r\nripening at Boston in fifty-three days from the time of sowing, and in\r\nEngland in forty-two days. We hope to be able, soon, to have this\r\nvariety for distribution. Early peas are seldom of high flavor; none\r\nthat we ever raised are comparable to the larger and later peas, and\r\nit is, therefore, except for market purposes, not desirable to plant\r\nvery largely of early sorts.\r\n\r\nOf late peas we have, after trying many sorts, fallen back upon the\r\nold-fashioned _Marrowfat_, and now raise it exclusively. It will be\r\nfit for the table in from seventy to eighty days after planting.\r\n_Knight’s tall marrowfat_ is recommended in Hovey’s Magazine (a\r\nstandard authority), as of “delicious quality and producing throughout\r\nthe whole season.” We have never had an opportunity of proving it.\r\n\r\nWe prefer _buying_ our seed to _raising_ it. In this region the\r\npea-bug pierces every seed-pea, and, although the germ is not usually\r\ndestroyed by this depredator, the seed is weakened, and the certainty\r\nof growth very much diminished. If one _must_ plant buggy peas, let\r\nthem have _scalding_ water poured upon them and turned off again\r\nimmediately. The bug will be destroyed and the pea not injured.\r\n\r\nWhen peas are up they require but one or two hoeings, as they soon\r\nshade the ground so as to prevent weeds from growing. They should be\r\nwell supplied with brush, strongly set in the ground. When peas are\r\nallowed to fall over, they become mildewed and rot. This also happens\r\nwhen the rows are planted so near together as to prevent free\r\ncirculation of air.\r\n\r\nWhen large quantities of peas are desired they should be sown\r\nbroad-cast, at the rate of about three bushels to the acre—more rather\r\nthan less. It leaves the land in fine tilth, smothering all weeds.\r\nThirty bushels to the acre is a fair crop; but eighty-four, and\r\neighty-eight, have been taken.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAUTUMN-PLANTED ONIONS.—Onions for seed should be planted in October;\r\nand, like their more brilliant, but less perfumed, friends of the\r\ntulip and hyacinth connections, they will thoroughly root themselves\r\nduring the autumn and mild winter weather, and be ready for early\r\nwork, the moment the frost rises from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT SHADE-TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would suggest to the editors of newspapers the propriety of\r\nestablishing in their columns a permanent agricultural department. We\r\nare much pleased to see that many excellent papers are doing it, and\r\nthat others insert occasional articles. Great advantage cannot fail to\r\naccrue to our town and rural population by putting into their hands\r\nevery week, able articles from practical farmers and gardeners upon\r\nthe various topics of agriculture and horticulture. Let every paper\r\nurge the setting out of shade-trees in our villages. It is greatly to\r\nbe desired, that all our towns should be filled with elms, maples,\r\nashes, locusts, etc. The cultivation of fruit may be much encouraged\r\nand promoted by a frequent republication of articles on that subject.\r\nThe gardens and conservatories of a few very wealthy gentlemen do not\r\nconstitute a horticultural community. They are of great use in the\r\nprocuration and cultivation of new varieties of plants, and in testing\r\nimportant matters by expensive experiments. But affluent men and their\r\npleasure grounds are to horticulture, what universities are to common\r\nschools; that State is best educated whose _whole_ population are the\r\nmost thoroughly trained; and that is _the_ horticultural State, _all_\r\nof whose villages, towns, farms, and gardens, are in the highest state\r\nof cultivation.\r\n\r\nOur desire is to diffuse a love for rural affairs, husbandry, and\r\nhorticulture among the whole mass of the community.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWEEDS IN ALLEYS.—It is said that weeds may be entirely destroyed for\r\nyears by copious watering with a solution of lime and sulphur in\r\nboiling-hot water. This, if effectual, will be highly important to\r\nsuch as have garden gravel walks, pavements, etc., through which grass\r\nand weeds grow up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOT-BEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a little practice any one can make and manage a simple hot-bed.\r\nFor a common family one twelve by four feet will be large enough, and\r\nnine by four will answer for a small family. _Frame._—The frame should\r\nbe made of two-inch stuff (pine or poplar). The back must be as high\r\nagain as the front, in order to give the right inclination to the\r\nsash. The ends should be nailed fast to corner posts, say four inches\r\nsquare. The back and front are to be attached to those parts by iron\r\nbolts, which may be screwed or unscrewed at pleasure. The frame may be\r\ntaken to pieces, if so made, and put away during the season it is not\r\nin use. A frame twelve by four, will take four sash of three feet\r\nwide, the other sized frame will take three sash. Where the sash meet,\r\na piece of wood three inches broad and two thick, should be let in\r\nfrom back to front, for the sash to run upon, and it may be allowed to\r\nextend back for two feet beyond the body of the frame. Three coats of\r\npaint should be put on the outside and inside of the frame, and then,\r\nwith good care, it will last twenty years. Mark out the ground six\r\ninches larger every way than your frame. Dig it out a foot deep. Take\r\nfresh, strong horse-dung. Shake it up and mix it thoroughly. Lay it\r\ninto the bed evenly, beating it down with the back of the fork, _but\r\nnever treading it_. Raise the bed three feet above the surface, making\r\nthe thickness in all four feet. In a week’s time this will have\r\nsettled six or eight inches. We have for the sake of a gentler and\r\nlonger continued heat, laid alternate layers of manure and _tan-bark_,\r\nand thus far it has done well with us. Put on the frame and sash and\r\nlet it stand till the heat begins to raise, which will be two or three\r\ndays. Then raise the sash to let the steam pass off. In about four\r\ndays take off the frame, put on about six inches of light, good soil,\r\nevenly, all over the bed; replace the frame, and in a day thereafter\r\nit will be ready for seed.\r\n\r\nCabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, egg plants, peppers, celery,\r\ncucumbers, lettuce, together with savory herbs, as sweet marjoram,\r\nsweet basil, thyme, sage, lavender, etc., etc. may be sown in drills\r\nin the soil prepared as above.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give, on paper, the directions for the care of the\r\nbed. The greatest dangers of all, are that of _burning_ the plants by\r\nexcessive heat, or of damping them off, by too little air. These evils\r\nmust be guarded against by the admission of as much air as possible.\r\nIn mild days let the sash be partly open all day, and in very cold\r\ndays, endeavor to procure a half hour even, at mid-day, for raising\r\nthe sash and airing the plants. As they grow up, if crowded, they\r\nshould be thinned out, so as not to run up spindling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL RECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we say _original_, we don’t mean that no one ever employed the\r\nsame recipes, but only this, that we have obtained them, not from\r\nbooks, but from good and skillful housewives.\r\n\r\nEPICURE’S CORN BREAD.—Upon two quarts of sifted corn-meal, pour just\r\nenough boiling water to scald it thoroughly; if too much water is used\r\nit will be heavy. Stir it thoroughly, let it get cold; then rub in a\r\npiece of butter as large as a hen’s egg, together with two\r\nteaspoonfuls of fine salt; beat four eggs thoroughly, and they will be\r\nall the better if the whites and yolks are beaten separately, add them\r\nto the meal and mix thoroughly. Next, add a pint of sour cream, or\r\nbutter-milk, or sour milk (which stand in the order of their value).\r\nDissolve two teapoonfuls of saleratus in hot water, and stir it in.\r\nPut it in buttered pans and bake it.\r\n\r\nIn winter, it may be mixed over night and in that case, the eggs and\r\nsaleratus should not be put in until morning. When ready for the oven,\r\nthe mixture ought to be about as thin as good _mush_, and if not, more\r\ncream should be added.\r\n\r\nIf you are not an epicure already, you will be in danger of becoming\r\none, if you eat much of this corn cake—_provided it is well made_.\r\n\r\nSUGAR GINGER-BREAD.—To three-quarters of a pound of butter and not\r\nquite a pint of finely rolled brown sugar, add a great spoonful of\r\nginger, and a little cinnamon and nutmeg; beat these up to a foam;\r\nbeat four eggs thoroughly and add and mix well, with the butter and\r\nsugar. Add a teacup of rich cream, a great spoonful of saleratus\r\ndissolved in hot water. Stir in sifted flour as long as it can be\r\nworked. Pound and knead the dough very thoroughly. Roll out quite\r\nthin, cut into small cakes, bake in a quick oven. They will be hard,\r\nbut tender and crisp.\r\n\r\nHOOSIER BISCUIT.—Add a teaspoonful of salt to a pint of new milk, warm\r\nfrom the cow. Stir in flour until it becomes a stiff batter; add two\r\ngreat spoonfuls of lively brewer’s yeast; put it in a warm place and\r\nlet it rise just as much as it will. When well raised, stir in a\r\nteaspoonful of saleratus dissolved in hot water. Beat up three eggs\r\n(two will answer), stir with the batter, and add flour until it\r\nbecomes tolerable stiff dough; knead it thoroughly, set it by the fire\r\nuntil it begins to rise, then roll out, cut to biscuit form, put in\r\npans, cover it over with a thick cloth, set by the fire until it rises\r\nagain, then bake in a quick oven. If well made, no directions will be\r\nneeded for eating.\r\n\r\nAs all families are not provided with scales and weights, referring to\r\nthe ingredients generally used in cakes and pastry, we subjoin a list\r\nof weights and measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WEIGHT AND MEASURE.\r\n\r\n  Wheat flour              one pound              is one quart.\r\n  Indian meal              one pound two ounces,  is one quart.\r\n  Butter, when soft        one pound one ounce,   is one quart.\r\n  Loaf-sugar, broken,      one pound              is one quart.\r\n  White sugar, powdered,   one pound one ounce,   is one quart.\r\n  Best brown sugar         one pound two ounces,  is one quart.\r\n  Eggs                     ten eggs              are one pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIQUID MEASURE.\r\n\r\n  Sixteen large tablespoonfuls   are                half a pint\r\n  Eight large tablespoonfuls     are                one gill.\r\n  Four large tablespoonfuls      are                half a gill.\r\n  A common sized tumber holds                       half a pint.\r\n  A common sized wine glass holds                   half a gill.\r\n\r\nAllowing for accidental differences in the quality, freshness,\r\ndryness, and moisture of the articles, we believe this comparison\r\nbetween weight and measure to be as nearly correct as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOKING VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we believe meat to be necessary to laboring men, we are equally\r\nsure that it is used to excess; for persons of a sedentary habit,\r\nvegetable diet is supposed to be much more wholesome, because much\r\nless stimulating than meat. Whatever shall make vegetables more\r\nrelishful will extend their popular use, and therefore any _simple_\r\nrecipe for cooking them is a public good. The following are taken\r\nfresh from the kitchen, and we will vouch for their being good,\r\nalthough there may be other ways still better.\r\n\r\n1. GREENS.—The articles employed for greens are numerous; we merely\r\nmention the following:—sprouts of turnip and cabbage, dandelions,\r\nlamb’s quarters, red-rooted plantain, cowslip, wild pepper-grass,\r\npurslain, young beet-tops, lettuce, and spinage—the best of all\r\ngreens.\r\n\r\nIn gathering plantain, care must be taken to select _only_ the\r\nred-rooted, the white being thought poisonous. With the exception of\r\nspinage, all these should be boiled in salted water, or in water with\r\na piece of salt pork, for half an hour, then taken out, drained, and\r\nserved up with butter gravy.\r\n\r\nSpinage is boiled, as above, for half an hour, then taken out,\r\nthoroughly drained, put into a skillet with cream, butter and pepper,\r\nand if need be, a little more salt. Place it over the fire and stir it\r\nup with a knife all the time it simmers, until it becomes a paste.\r\nAbout five minutes are enough for this last process—then dish and\r\nserve it.\r\n\r\n2. ASPARAGUS.—Asparagus should never be cut _below the surface of the\r\nground_, although books and papers, almost universally, direct to the\r\ncontrary. The white part of the stem is always tough and inedible. Let\r\nit spring up about six or eight inches and then cut it _at_ the\r\nsurface of the ground. Lay it in the pan or kettle in which it is to\r\nbe cooked, and sprinkle salt over it. Pour boiling water over it,\r\nuntil it is just covered; boil from fifteen to twenty-five minutes,\r\naccording to the age of the asparagus. Have two or three nicely\r\ntoasted slices of bread in the dish which is to go to the table; lay\r\nthe asparagus upon the toast, putting first sweet butter and pepper\r\nupon it according to your taste; lastly pour over it the liquor in\r\nwhich it was boiled. Many throw away the water in which it was cooked\r\nand substitute cream and butter, but thereby the finest flavor of the\r\nvegetable is thrown away and lost.\r\n\r\n3. BEETS.—While young, beets may be boiled tops and all; as the tops\r\nget tough the root alone is boiled in salted water until tender, viz.\r\nfrom three-quarters of an hour to an hour and a half; according to the\r\nsize of the beet. Quarter or slice them if large, and add fresh sweet\r\nbutter and pepper.\r\n\r\n4. PEAS.—No vegetable depends more for its excellence upon good\r\ncooking than peas. Have them freshly gathered and shelled, _but never\r\nwash them_. If they are not perfectly clean, roll them in a dry cloth;\r\nbut even this is seldom required, and then only through carelessness.\r\nPour them dry into the cooking dish, and put as much salt over them as\r\nis required, then pour on boiling water enough to cover them; boil\r\nthem fifteen minutes if they are young; no pea is fit to cook which\r\nrequires more than half an hour’s boiling. When done, put to a quart\r\nof peas three great tablespoonfuls of butter, and pepper to your\r\ntaste. Put all the water to them in which they were boiled. The great\r\nmistakes in cooking peas are in cooking too long, and in deluging them\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\nSTRING or SNAP beans are cooked like peas, only they require longer\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\n5. CORN should be boiled in salted water from twenty to thirty\r\nminutes, according to its age; if boiled longer it becomes hard and\r\nloses its flavor. We have given in the _Western Farmer and Gardener_,\r\np. 231, a recipe for corn and beans, but as all may not see that\r\nperiodical, we extract the substance of it.\r\n\r\nWe give directions for a mess sufficient for a family of six or seven.\r\n\r\nTo about half a pound of salt pork put three quarts of cold water; let\r\nit boil. Now cut off three quarts of green corn from the cobs, set the\r\ncorn aside and put _the cobs_ to boil with the pork, as they will add\r\nmuch to the richness of the mixture. When the pork has boiled, say\r\nhalf an hour, remove the cobs and put in one quart of freshly-gathered,\r\ngreen, shelled beans; boil again for fifteen minutes; then add the\r\nthree quarts of corn and let it boil another fifteen minutes. Now turn\r\nthe whole out into a dish, add five or six large spoonfuls of butter,\r\nseason it with pepper to your taste, and with salt also, if the salt\r\nof the pork has not proved sufficient. If the liquor has boiled away,\r\nit will be necessary to add a little more to it before taking it away\r\nfrom the fire, as this is an essential part of the affair.\r\n\r\n6. SALSIFY OR OYSTER-PLANT.—This vegetable is raised exactly as are\r\ncarrots and parsnips. Like the latter—they require a little frosting\r\nbefore their flavor is fully developed.\r\n\r\nThey should be scraped and washed (but _not_ soaked in vinegar, as\r\nEnglish cooks direct, to extract a bitter taste, which they do _not_\r\ncontain), and sliced; sprinkle enough salt upon them to season them,\r\npour on just enough boiling water to cover them; boil till perfectly\r\ntender, which will be, say fifteen minutes. Put butter and pepper to\r\nthem; stir up a little flour in cream to make a thin paste and pour in\r\nenough to thicken a little the water in which they were boiled. Dish\r\nwith or without toasted bread, as may suit the taste.\r\n\r\n7. TOMATOES.—The recipe which we gave in the _Farmer and Gardener_ has\r\nbeen universally copied, and, we believe, has beguiled thousands to\r\nthe love of tomatoes. It has been introduced to cook-books under the\r\nname of “Indiana Recipe for Cooking Tomatoes.”\r\n\r\n8. ONIONS should be boiled for half an hour in salted water, then\r\ndrained, put into sweet milk, boiled again for five or ten minutes,\r\nseasoned with butter, pepper and salt, and served up.\r\n\r\n9. PIE-PLANT.—This important vegetable—among the earliest, the most\r\nwholesome, and of the easiest culture—should be found in every garden,\r\nand served up on every table during the spring and early summer. To\r\nprepare it for use, strip off the skin, slice it thin, put into a dish\r\nwith a few spoonfuls of boiling water, just enough to keep from\r\nsticking, for its own juice will afford liquid enough after it is\r\ncooked. Boil until it is perfectly tender, stirring it constantly. If\r\nthe plant is good and the fire quick, it ought to be boiled in five\r\nminutes. Stir in all the sugar needed while it is in a scalding state.\r\nA little nutmeg or lemon peel, put in while it is hot, improves the\r\nflavor. When cool, it may be used for tarts, or pies, with or without\r\nupper crust; it also makes a better _apple_-sauce than apples do\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n10. EGG-PLANT.—Boil in salted water a few minutes; cut slices, put a\r\nlittle salt between each slice, and let them lie for half an hour.\r\nThen fry them in butter or lard until they are brown.\r\n\r\n11. CAULIFLOWER AND BROCCOLI.—The only difference between these, so\r\nfar as the cook is concerned, is in color. Take off the outside leaves\r\nand soak them for an hour in salted water. Pour boiling water to them\r\nand boil for about twenty minutes. Serve them up with butter and\r\npepper. The Savoy cabbages are next in delicacy of flavor to the\r\ncauliflower, and may be cooked in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS, TAKE A HINT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very surprising to see how slow men are to take a hint. The\r\nfrost destroys about half the bloom on the fruit-trees; everybody\r\nprognosticates the loss of fruit; instead of that, the _half_ that\r\nremains is larger, fairer, and higher flavored than usual; and the\r\ntrees instead of being exhausted, are ready for another crop the next\r\nyear. Why don’t the owner _take the hint_ and thin out his fruit every\r\nbearing year? But no; the next season sees his orchard overloaded,\r\nfruit small, and not well formed; yet he always _boasts_ of that\r\nfirst-mentioned crop without profiting by the lesson it teaches.\r\n\r\nWe heard a man saying, “the best crop of celery I ever saw, was raised\r\nby old John ——, on a spot of ground where the wash from the barn-yard\r\nran into it after every hard shower.” Did he take the hint, and convey\r\nsuch liquid manure in trenches to his garden? Not at all; he bragged\r\nabout that wonderful crop of celery, but would not take the hint.\r\n\r\nWe knew a case where a farmer subsoiled a field and raised crops in\r\nconsequence which were the admiration of the neighborhood; and for\r\nyears the field showed the advantage of deep handling. But we could\r\nnot learn that a single farmer in the neighborhood took the hint. The\r\nman who acted thus wisely, sold his farm and his successor pursued the\r\nold way of surface-scratching.\r\n\r\nA stanch farmer complained to us of his soil as too loose and light;\r\nwe mentioned ashes as worth trying; “well, now you mention it, I\r\nbelieve it will do good. I bought a part of my farm from a man who was\r\na wonderful fellow to save up ashes, and around his cabin it lay in\r\nheaps. I took away the house and ordered the ashes to be scattered,\r\nand to this day I notice that when the plow runs along through that\r\nspot, the ground turns up moist and close-grained.” It is strange that\r\nhe never took the hint! There are thousands of bushels of ashes lying\r\nnot far from his farm about an old soap and candle factory with which\r\nhe might have dressed his whole farm.\r\n\r\nA farmer gets a splendid crop of corn or grain from off a grass or\r\nclover lay. Does he take the hint? Does he adopt the system which\r\nshall allow him every year just such a sward to put his grain on? No,\r\nhe hates book-farming, and scientific farming, and “this notion of\r\nrotation;” and jogs on the old way.\r\n\r\nA few years ago our farmers got roundly into debt; and they have\r\nworried and sweat under it, till some of them have grown greyer, and\r\nadded not a few wrinkles to their face. Do they take the hint? Are\r\nthey not pitching into debt again?\r\n\r\nA few years ago _mules_ commanded a high price; everybody raised mules\r\nforthwith; the market of course was glutted; the price fell; everybody\r\nquit the business; markets became empty and the price rose; a few men\r\nwho had stuck to the business pushed in their droves and made money;\r\nand now everybody is raising mules again. The same game is played\r\nevery four or five years with pork; men make when pork is scarce, but\r\nfew farmers have stock on hand. They instantly rush into the business,\r\nflood the country with hogs and get almost nothing for them. Why don’t\r\nmen take the hint? _A moderate stock all the time_, makes more money\r\nthan that system which has none when the price is high and too many\r\nwhen the price is low.\r\n\r\nBecause one year, the wheat crop has been very large and fine, and the\r\nprice low, not half so much will be put in another year. Those who are\r\nwise, foreseeing this fact and sowing largely, will, if the season\r\nfavors wheat, reap a handsome profit.\r\n\r\nAuctioneers tell us that a “wink is as good as a word.” We give both,\r\nand hope our readers will _take the hint_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXING PAINT, AND LAYING IT ON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is convenient, and oftentimes, on the score of economy, necessary\r\nfor persons (who have not been apprenticed to the trade), to do their\r\nown painting. To enable such to practise with success, we propose\r\ngiving a few hints.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPECTING THE ARTICLES USED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE LEAD.—This is extensively manufactured in all of our principal\r\ncities. Low priced leads are always adulterated by _chalk_, or, as it\r\nis called in its prepared state, _whiting_. It is sometimes so largely\r\nmixed with this, as to be worthless, and every one has observed\r\nhouses, painted for a year or so, from which the paint rubs off like\r\nwhitewash, in consequence of the use of adulterated lead. The poorest\r\nlead is sold _without any brand_. The common article is branded as No.\r\n1, with the maker’s name. The best article is branded with the maker’s\r\nname, as PURE, or SUPERIOR. It is the best economy always to use the\r\npure lead.\r\n\r\nOIL.—Linseed oil is that usually employed in painting. It contains a\r\nlarge amount of fatty substance and of other impurity, which should be\r\nseparated from it before it is used. _This is to be done by boiling._\r\nFor outside work, the oil should _always be boiled_, no matter what\r\nthe painter says about it. Great care should be taken in doing this.\r\nLet the kettle be set out of doors, the heat be increased gradually,\r\nbut never enough to produce violent boiling, as the oil will expand,\r\nrun over, and take fire, when nothing can save it, or the house\r\neither, oftentimes, if you have been foolish enough to do it within\r\ndoors. As fast as impurities rise to the surface, skim them off—when\r\nthe oil has a clear look, slack off the fire and let the oil cool;\r\ncarefully turn off the clear portion, leaving the _sediment_\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nDRYERS.—Substances used to make paint dry quickly are called _Dryers_.\r\nFor light work sugar of lead is the best; for colored paint, litharge\r\nand red lead are employed. Spirits of turpentine is used for the same\r\npurpose. Litharge and red lead are usually boiled in with the oil at\r\nthe rate of about a quarter of a pound of litharge to a gallon of oil.\r\n\r\nMIXING AND LAYING ON.—Paint is purchased in kegs, containing\r\ntwenty-five pounds of lead ground in oil, and ready for mixing. The\r\nkegs themselves make excellent paint-pots. The lead is to be mixed\r\naccording to the work to be done. If paint is laid on in heavy coats\r\nit will crack and peel off. If several thin coats are successively\r\nlaid on, it forms a solid body. The first coat is called _priming_.\r\nThe lead is made quite thin with oil for priming. Before laying it on,\r\nlet the work be cleaned, all dust and dirt be removed. The surface is\r\nthen covered evenly with paint, and allowed to dry thoroughly.\r\n\r\nSECOND COAT.—Let nail-holes, cracks, etc., be filled with putty; for\r\ncolored painting, red-lead putty is the best. The paint should be\r\nmixed to the thickness of thin cream, and laid on _evenly_, but not in\r\ntoo great quantities. In nice work, after this coat has thoroughly\r\ndried, it should be rubbed down with pumice-stone or fine sand-paper.\r\nThe third coat is to be laid on as was the second. Three coats, at\r\nleast, are required for good painting. Four or five will be still\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nPaint mixed with boiled oil usually has a glossy appearance. If it is\r\ndesired to increase this, small portions of varnish are added. This is\r\nusually confined to outside work.\r\n\r\nIn cities the glossy surface of paint, is dis-esteemed for inside\r\nwork; and instead, a _flatted_ white is laid on. This is produced by\r\nmixing the lead for the last coat with turpentine instead of oil, by\r\nwhich a dull white is made. Flatted colors are not susceptible of\r\nbeing cleaned by washing more that once or twice, whereas common paint\r\nwill endure washing, if carefully performed, for years. If painting is\r\n_well done_, and the paint is of the best materials, it ought to last\r\ntwenty years. But the trash too often daubed upon buildings, does not\r\nlast five years.\r\n\r\nWhite will keep its color best for outside work. Some tint is thought\r\nto be more agreeable for inside work. Much judgment is required in\r\npreparing colored or tinted paints; and verbal directions cannot well\r\nbe given for it in any moderate space. The usual pigments employed in\r\nmaking up the tints most in fashion, are for _grey_—white lead,\r\nPrussian blue, ivory black, and lake, or Venetian red; for _pea_ and\r\n_sea greens_—white, Prussian blue, and yellow; for _olive\r\ngreen_—white, Prussian blue, umber, and yellow ochre; for _fawn\r\ncolor_—burned terra sienna, umber, and white.\r\n\r\nWe add two recipes taken from an English work, for a cheap paint for\r\ninside walls.\r\n\r\n    “MILK PAINT.—A paint has been used on the Continent with\r\n    success, made from _milk_ and _lime_, that dries quicker than\r\n    oil paint, and has no smell. It is made in the following\r\n    manner: Take fresh curds and bruise the lumps on a\r\n    grinding-stone, or in an earthen pan, or mortar, with a\r\n    spatula or strong spoon. Then put them into a pot with an\r\n    equal quantity of lime, well slacked with water, to make it\r\n    just thick enough to be kneaded. Stir this mixture without\r\n    adding more water, and a white-colored fluid will soon be\r\n    obtained, which will serve as a paint. It may be laid on with\r\n    a brush with as much ease us varnish, and it dries very\r\n    speedily. It must, however, be used the same day it is made,\r\n    for if kept till next day it will be too thick: consequently\r\n    no more must be mixed up at one time than can be laid on in a\r\n    day. If any color be required, any of the ochres, as yellow\r\n    ochre, or red ochre, or umber, may be mixed with it in any\r\n    proportion. Prussian blue would be changed by the lime. Two\r\n    coats of this paint will be sufficient, and when quite dry it\r\n    may be polished with a piece of woollen cloth, or similar\r\n    substance, and it will become as bright as varnish. It will\r\n    only do for inside work; but it will last longer if varnished\r\n    over with white of egg after it has been polished.”\r\n\r\n    “_The following recipe for milk paint_ is given in ‘Smith’s\r\n    Art of House Painting:’ Take of skimmed milk nearly two\r\n    quarts; of fresh-slaked lime about six ounces and a half; of\r\n    linseed oil four ounces, and of whiting three pounds; put the\r\n    lime into a stone vessel, and pour upon it a sufficient\r\n    quantity of milk to form a mixture resembling thin cream;\r\n    then add the oil, a little at a time, stirring it with a\r\n    small spatula; the remaining milk is then to be added, and\r\n    lastly the whiting. The milk must on no account be sour.\r\n    Slake the lime by dipping the pieces in water, out of which\r\n    it is to be immediately taken, and left to slake in the air.\r\n    For fine white paint the oil of caraway is best, because\r\n    colorless; but with ochres the commonest oils may be used.\r\n    The oil when mixed with the milk and lime entirely\r\n    disappears, and is totally dissolved by the lime, forming a\r\n    calcareous soap. The whiting or ochre is to be gently\r\n    crumbled on the surface of the fluid, which it gradually\r\n    imbibes, and at last sinks: at this period it must be well\r\n    stirred in. This paint may be colored like distemper or\r\n    size-color, with levigated charcoal, yellow ochre, etc., and\r\n    used in the same manner. The quantity here prescribed is\r\n    sufficient to cover twenty-seven square yards with the first\r\n    coat, and it will cost about three halfpence a yard. The same\r\n    paint will do for outdoor work by the addition of two ounces\r\n    of slaked lime, two ounces of linseed oil, and two ounces of\r\n    white Burgundy pitch: the pitch to be melted in a gentle heat\r\n    with the oil, and then added to the smooth mixture of the\r\n    milk and lime. In cold weather it must be mixed warm, to\r\n    facilitate its incorporation with the milk.”\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe add several recipes of various convenient kinds of paint to be\r\nemployed in particular situations, and for special purposes.\r\n\r\n     “_A coating to preserve wood in damp situations_ may be made\r\n     by beating twelve pounds of resin in a mortar, and adding to\r\n     it three pounds of sulphur and twelve pints of whale oil.\r\n     This mixture must then be melted over a fire, and stirred\r\n     well while it is melting. Ochre of any required color,\r\n     ground in oil, may be put to it. This composition must be\r\n     laid on hot, and when the first coat is dry, which will be\r\n     in two or three days, a second coat may be given; and a\r\n     third, if necessary.”\r\n\r\n     “_Gas tar_, with yellow ochre, makes a very cheap and\r\n     durable green paint for iron rails and coarse woodwork.”\r\n\r\n     “_Composition to lay on a boarded building, to resist the\r\n     weather and likewise fire._—Take one measure of fine sand,\r\n     two measures of wood-ashes well sifted, three of slaked lime\r\n     ground up with oil, and mix them together; lay this on with\r\n     a brush, the first coat thin, the second thick. This adheres\r\n     so strongly to the boards covered with it, that it resists\r\n     an iron tool, and the action of fire, and is impenetrable by\r\n     water.”\r\n\r\n     “_A flexible paint for canvas_ is made by stirring into\r\n     fifty-six pounds of common oil paint a solution of soap lye,\r\n     made of half a pound of soap and three pounds of water: it\r\n     must be used while warm.”\r\n\r\n     “_A black coloring for garden walls_ may be made by mixing\r\n     quicklime, lampblack, a little copperas, and hot water.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN WEEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter hot weather sets in many are naturally inclined to relax their\r\ngarden labors; they have eaten their salads, their radishes and peas;\r\ntheir beans and corn require but little attention, and as for the\r\nrest, it is left to the company of weeds.\r\n\r\nWEEDS.—If the garden be thoroughly hoed twice or three times, the\r\nlabor of keeping down weeds the rest of the summer will be small. It\r\nis best to go over a compartment first with the hoe, to cut off weeds\r\nand loosen the soil, then with a rake go over it again, levelling and\r\nsmoothing the surface, and collecting the weeds into heaps, which\r\nshould be wheeled to the manure-corner and left to decay. In raking,\r\ntread backward so that your tracks will be covered by the rake, and\r\nthe bed left even.\r\n\r\nAmong the most vexatious weeds may be mentioned the purslain\r\n(_Portulacca oleracea_), commonly called pussly. It comes in May and\r\nlasts through the summer. One plant bears seed enough for a whole\r\nacre. It is very tenacious of life. The least bit of root sprouts\r\nagain, and when rooted up, if a single fibre touches the soil, it\r\nstarts off in full vigor. When boiled it furnishes a very palatable\r\narticle of “greens.” We go over the ground with a hoe, then rake it\r\ninto heaps and wheel it to the barn-yard. Hogs are fond of it, and it\r\nis said to fatten them well. It is somewhat amusing to those who are\r\nvexed at its insuperable intrusiveness and its inevitable vigor, to\r\nhear English garden-books speaking of it as “somewhat tender,” of\r\nraising it on hot-beds, of drilling it in the open garden, of watering\r\nit in dry weather thrice a week, and cutting it carefully so that it\r\nmay sprout again! Cut it as you please, gentlemen! rake it into\r\nalleys, let an August sun scorch it, and if there is so much as a\r\nhandful of dirt thrown _at it_, no fear but that it will sprout again.\r\nIt is a vegetable type of immortality. The Jamestown weed (called\r\njimpsum), the Spanish needle, lamb’s-quarters, etc., are easily\r\neradicated for the season by one or two hoeings. The grasses which\r\ninfest gardens, spreading into a cultivated ground from the\r\ngrass-plat, or brought in with manure, are easily weeded out if\r\nplucked while small; but if left, the long spreading-roots tear up\r\ntender plants along with them.\r\n\r\nIt is said that if no seeds were brought into the land by wind or\r\nmanure, or growth, the stock of weeds might be eradicated in eight\r\nyears. But so long as corners and fence edges are reserved as\r\nweed-nurseries, to furnish an annual supply of seed, no one need fear\r\nthat gardening will become too easy from want of work.\r\n\r\nWe know of but two reasons for letting weeds grow to any size. In a\r\nlarge garden, when all the ground is not to be planted at once, the\r\nreserved portions may be suffered to sprout all the weeds, and when\r\nsix or eight inches high, if turned under, they will furnish good\r\nmanure. Again, when cut-worms are very numerous, when tomatoes and\r\ncabbages have been set out on a clean compartment, we have lost from a\r\nhalf to two-thirds of the plants. If the weeds are kept down just\r\nabout the hill, and permitted to grow for a few weeks, between the\r\nrows, although it has a very slovenly look, it will save the cabbages,\r\netc., by giving ample foot to the cut-worm. When the plants grow tough\r\nin the stem the weeds may be lightly spaded in, and the surface\r\nlevelled with a rake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCERNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis admirable plant is not so well known as it should be. It\r\nresembles a clover, and is used for green food for cattle, for which\r\nit is peculiarly adapted both by its nutriciousness and its endurance\r\nof repeated cuttings. Care must be taken to put it upon the right soil\r\nand it will bear mowing four or five times a year, and will last for\r\nten years—with care five years more! The soil for it is a _deep_, a\r\nvery deep vegetable loam, which drains itself perfectly and yet\r\nwithout becoming dry. It has a fusiform root, which, as the plant\r\ngrows older, extends downward from four to six feet. The subsoil is\r\nregarded by Flemish farmers as of more importance than the surface\r\nsoil. A stiff, cold, clay, a wet and springy soil; a hard, cold, wet\r\nsubsoil of any sort, is unfavorable to it. It should therefore be\r\ntried on warm, dry, and rich soils, than which none are better than\r\nour sandy alluvions or bottom lands. During its first year it requires\r\nsome care, to keep down weeds, as it is easily smothered; but when\r\nonce established it rules the soil in defiance of anything. If the\r\nground is _very_ clean, it may be sown broadcast; but it is always\r\nsafer and often _necessary_ to drill it. Authors vary as to the\r\nquantity of seed required per acre, Von Thaër says six to eight\r\npounds, while his French editor says from sixteen to eighteen. We\r\nsuppose that from ten to twelve pounds will be a fair amount.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants are well established they will be improved by severe\r\nharrowing every spring, a sharp harrow being used until the field\r\nlooks as if it were plowed.\r\n\r\nLucerne has been tried by a few cultivators in the West, but by more\r\nin the East, with great success, and it has this peculiar excellence,\r\nthat, thanks to its very long roots, it withstands our severest\r\ndroughts; indeed our hottest and dryest summers are those which it\r\nseems to delight in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n“William! stop that noise, I say—_won’t_ you stop! Stop, I Tell you,\r\nor I’ll slap your mouth.”\r\n\r\nWilliam bawls a little louder.\r\n\r\n“William, I tell you! ain’t you going to stop? _Stop_ I say! If you\r\ndon’t stop I’ll whip you, sure.”\r\n\r\nWilliam goes up a fifth, and beats time with his heels.\r\n\r\n“I never saw such a child!—he’s got temper enough for a whole town;\r\nI’m sure he didn’t get it from me. Why don’t you be still! Whist.\r\nWh-i-st. Come, come, be still, won’t you? Stop, _stop_, STOP, I say!\r\nDon’t you see this—don’t you see this stick? See here now,” (cuts the\r\nair with the stick).\r\n\r\nWilliam, more furious, kicks very manfully at his mother—grows redder\r\nin the face, lets out the last note, and begins to reel, and shake,\r\nand twist, in a most spiteful manner.\r\n\r\n“Come, William! come dear—that’s a darling—naughty William! come,\r\nthat’s a good boy; donty cry, p-o-o-r, little fellow; sant ab-o-o-s-e\r\nyou, sall eh! Ma’s ittle man, want a piece of sooger? Ma’s little boy\r\ngot cramp, p-o-o-r little sick boy,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWilliam wipes up, and minds, and eats his sugar, and stops.\r\n\r\nAFTER SCENE.—The minister is present, and very nice talk is going on\r\nupon the necessity of governing children. “Too true,” says mamma,\r\n“some people _will_ give up to their children, and it ruins them—every\r\nchild should be governed. But then it won’t do to carry it _too_ far;\r\nif one whips all the time it will break a child’s spirit. One ought to\r\nmix kindness and firmness together in managing children.”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” said the preacher; “firmness first and then kindness.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, that’s my practice exactly.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALOGUE OF FLOWERS, SEEDS, AND FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have received from different directions catalogues of seeds,\r\nflowers, and fruits. Instead of a mere mention of them, we shall\r\nemploy them as _texts_ for some remarks on the departments to which\r\nthey belong.\r\n\r\nThe kinds, and varieties of the same kind of vegetables advertised are\r\nsatisfactory. Then there is evidence that the easily besetting sin of\r\nseed establishments has been resisted and very much overcome, viz.: _a\r\nprodigal multiplication of varieties_. Now we do not wish to tie down\r\na seedsman to only one variety of cucumber—one pea—one bean; for there\r\nis great advantage in having many varieties of the same vegetable.\r\nSome love mild radishes, and some love the full peppery taste; as both\r\nqualities cannot exist in the same variety it is desirable to have\r\ntwo. But some radishes which do admirably in the spring and early\r\nsummer, lose their good qualities if planted in summer. We therefore\r\nseek and find a summer variety. This again fails for late autumnal\r\nuse, and we procure a (so called) winter sort. We need one pea for its\r\n_earliness_: but early fruit seldom has size or a high flavor; we\r\ndesire other varieties, therefore, for flavor, even though, in giving\r\nthem a longer period to perfect their juices, we have a late pea. But\r\nsome men raise peas for _market_, and cannot afford to raise a pea\r\nmerely because fine-flavored, unless also it is _prolific_. Then, once\r\nmore, market peas must be raised, usually as a _field-pea_, and sown\r\nbroadcast. Some peas stand up stronger than others, and these are of\r\ncourse preferred. Now, as we cannot find any vegetable that combines\r\nall the qualities of _earliness_, _size_, _flavor_, and adaptation to\r\nvariety of soil and diversity of cultivation, we come as near to it as\r\npossible, by gaining _varieties_, in which some one or more of these\r\nqualities are better developed than in any others. The reasons for\r\nmultiplying varieties afford a rule by which they may be limited.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a seed is a variety different from all others is no good\r\nreason for retaining or cultivating it; it must, in SOME _respects,\r\nsurpass others_ now in use, or it only encumbers the garden. What is\r\nthe use of ten varieties of peas ripening at the same time of one\r\nsize, and differing from each other in not one assignable particular?\r\nWhen a catalogue enumerates _fifty varieties_ of cabbage, or pea, or\r\nbean, are we to believe that each of the _fifty_ has a virtue peculiar\r\nto itself? If not, if two-thirds of them have no merit which is not\r\nfound, and found in a higher degree, in the one-third they have no\r\nbusiness to be retained. Let the one-third, stand and the rest be\r\nerased. We regard a _very_ fat catalogue as we do a very fat man—all\r\nthe worse for its obesity. In comparing catalogues, we are not left as\r\nmuch without an authoritative standard of judgment, in respect _to a\r\nproper extension of the number of varieties_, as might at first\r\nappear. English gardening has been carried to such a degree of\r\nexcellence, both as an art and as a science, that we may regard the\r\ndeliberate judgment of the best gardeners as law on this subject. When\r\nLoudon published his invaluable “Encyclopedia of Gardening,” he was\r\npermitted by the London Horticultural Society to avail himself of the\r\nservices of the distinguished Monro in the department of culinary\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nLet us compare the catalogues of three first rate seedsmen as it\r\nrespects a multiplication of varieties, with Mr. Monro’s selections:\r\n\r\n  +--------+--------+-----+------+----+------+-------+----+-----+-------+\r\n  |        |Cucumber|Melon|Celery|Beet|Turnip|Cabbage|Peas|Beans|Lettuce|\r\n  +--------+--------+-----+------+----+------+-------+----+-----+-------+\r\n  |Landreth|    2   | 15  |  2   | 5  |   9  |  10   |  7 | 15  |   8   |\r\n  |        +--------+-----+------+----+------+-------+----+-----+-------+\r\n  |Breck   |    9   | 10  |  6   | 8  |  22  |  18   | 20 | 24  |  12   |\r\n  |        +--------+-----+------+----+------+-------+----+-----+-------+\r\n  |Prince  |   17   | 25  |  8   | 9  |  30  |  49   | 47 | 61  |  56   |\r\n  +--------+--------+-----+------+----+------+-------+----+-----+-------+\r\n\r\nMr. Monro names _nineteen_ kinds of peas only, instead of\r\n_forty-seven_: _twenty-two_ kinds of beans instead of _sixty-one_;\r\nseven varieties of turnip instead of _twenty-two_, or, worse yet,\r\n_thirty_; _fourteen_ sorts of lettuce, instead of _fifty-two_.\r\n\r\nTo the uninitiated a catalogue may look meagre with only _eight_ kinds\r\nof lettuce instead of _fifty_; _fifteen_ beans instead of _sixty-one_,\r\netc., but these corpulent catalogues make meagre pockets, except in\r\nthe case of the _seedsman_. A much greater latitude of varieties is\r\nallowable in a nursery catalogue than in a seedsman’s list. But in\r\neven these there is a disposition to extravagance which needs to be\r\ncorrected. Where the disproportion of knowledge between the buyers and\r\nseller is so great as it is, and for some time, must be, in\r\nhorticultural matters, it becomes nurserymen and seedsmen who _are_\r\nhonest (and we have many such, and they are increasing)—those who\r\nregard their business as an honorable branch of _science_, as well as\r\na proper means of livelihood, and who hope to gain a high\r\n_reputation_, even more than they do wealth, it becomes such to render\r\nthe lists SELECT; and while the monstrously bloated catalogues of\r\nboasting and avaricious men continue to perplex and deceive the\r\nunwary, let all intelligent cultivators _sustain_ those who rely on\r\nthe _quality_ rather than _quantity_ of their articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN SEEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood seeds are the very first requisite for a good garden; soil and\r\nculture cannot make good crops out of bad seed.\r\n\r\n1. As a general rule, _buy your seeds_. The reasons for it are so many\r\nand so good, that you will certainly do it, unless _economy_ prevent;\r\nbut it is better to economize elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, seed-raising is a delicate business; and, for many\r\nreasons, will be better done by those who make it their business, than\r\nby those who do not. A reputable seedsman never dreams of raising,\r\nhimself, all the seeds which he sells. For example, one sort of seed\r\nis let out to a farmer who contracts to raise it in a given soil and\r\nmanner, and at a distance from all other seeds. One man raises the\r\nbeet seed—another man, very often hundreds of miles distant, another\r\nsort. Peas are sent to Vermont and to Canada, where the pea-bug does\r\nnot infest them. Some seeds, for which this climate is not favorable,\r\nare imported from Italy, from Guernsey—just as flowering bulbs are\r\nfrom Holland. We suppose this to be true of Landreth, Thornburn,\r\nPrince, Bliss, Risley, etc. In cases where seeds are raised upon the\r\npremises of the seedsman, they are put on different parts of the farm,\r\nas far apart as possible.\r\n\r\nThose precautions are indispensable to the procuration of the _best_\r\nseeds of esculent vegetables. Species of the same genus, with open\r\nflowers, are so easily _crossed_, that, if grown contiguously, they\r\ncannot be kept pure. All _cucurbitaceous_ plants, such as squashes,\r\npumpkins, melons, cucumbers, gourds, etc., will mix and degenerate if\r\nplanted even in the same garden. Let any one who wishes to see how it\r\nis done, watch the bee covering itself with golden pollen as it\r\nsearches for honey in the cells of the flower, and darting off to\r\nanother, mingling the fertilizing powder of the two. In a single\r\nmorning, cucumbers will be mixed with each other, and with\r\ncanteloupes; squashes will be crossed, and in the next generation will\r\nshow it. Where the organs of flowers are protected, as in the pea,\r\nbean, etc., by a floral envelope, insects do not mix their pollen. I\r\nhave never known pure beet seed raised in a private garden which had\r\nmore than the single kind in it—or when another garden was near which\r\nhad other sorts.\r\n\r\nWe prefer, _generally_, northern seeds to those raised elsewhere. A\r\nmere change of soil and climate is often advantageous to seeds. But\r\nbesides this, greater care and skill are usually employed at the north\r\nin producing sound and safe seeds.\r\n\r\nWe can recommend, from repeated trials, the seeds of Risley, Chatauque\r\ncounty, N. Y., and of Mr. Breck of Boston. Landreth of Philadelphia\r\nhas a high reputation; so have the veteran Thorburn of John Street,\r\nand the enterprising house of B. K. Bliss & Sons of Park Place, New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n2. Some seeds retain their power of germination to an astonishing\r\nlength of time, as will appear from facts stated by Prof. Lindley:\r\n\r\n“Not to speak of the doubtful instances of seeds taken from the\r\nPyramids having germinated, melons have been known to grow at the age\r\nof 40 years, kidney beans at 100, sensitive-plant at 60, rye at 40;\r\nand there are now growing, in the garden of the Horticultural Society,\r\nraspberry plants raised from seeds 1600 or 1700 years old.” (See\r\n“Introduction to Botany,” ed. 3, p. 358.)\r\n\r\nBut in selecting seeds, _fresh_ ones should be had if possible. Where,\r\nhowever, the vegetable is cultivated for the sake of its flower, or\r\nits fruit, it is sometimes better to select old seed. Thus balsamines\r\n(the touch-me-not) and the cucumber, squash and melon tribe do better\r\non seeds three or four years old; for fresh seeds produce plants whose\r\ngrowth will be too luxuriant for producing fruit; whereas from old\r\nseed, the plants have less vigor of growth but a greater tendency to\r\nfruit well.\r\n\r\nWe insert a table, exhibiting the years which different seeds will\r\nretain their vitality.\r\n\r\n  TIME THAT SEEDS WILL KEEP.\r\n\r\n                      YEARS.\r\n  Asparagus           4 or 13\r\n  Balm                2\r\n  Basil               1 or 3\r\n  Beans               1 or 2\r\n  Beets               8 or 10\r\n  Borage              2\r\n  Cabbage             6 or 8\r\n  Carrot              1 or 7\r\n  Celery              6 or 8\r\n  Corn                2 or 3\r\n  Cress               2\r\n  Cucumber            8 or 10\r\n  Caraway             4\r\n  Fennel              6\r\n  Garlic              3\r\n  Leek                3 or 4\r\n  Lettuce             3 or 4\r\n  Mangel Wurtzel      8 or 10\r\n  Marjoram            4\r\n  Melon               8 or 10\r\n  Mustard             3 or 4\r\n  Nasturtium          2 or 3\r\n  Onion               3\r\n  Parsley             5 or 6\r\n  Parsnip             1\r\n  Pea                 2 or 3\r\n  Pumpkin             8 or 10\r\n  Pepper              5 or 6\r\n  Radish              6 or 8\r\n  Rue                 3\r\n  Ruta Baga           4\r\n  Salsify             2\r\n  Savory              3 or 4\r\n  Spinage             3 or 4\r\n  Squash              8 or 10\r\n  Turnip              3 or 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS’ GARDENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers are apt to have very inferior gardens. The idea is, that in\r\nthe spring they have no time; the farm crops are of more importance.\r\nIn consequence of such a decision, no garden will be had unless the\r\nhousewife is willing to be gardenwife too. At her importunity at\r\nlength one horse is put to the plow and the garden is broken up—say\r\nfour inches deep. Possibly the boy is allowed to throw up the beds,\r\nbut very often even this is left to woman’s hand. She has to hunt up\r\nseed; peppers are pulled off from the ceiling and eviscerated; drawers\r\nare ransacked for the bag of radish seed or the paper of lettuce seed;\r\nthe old broken pitcher is taken from its long seclusion on the top of\r\nthe cupboard and emptied of its beans and peas; withal a few flower\r\nseeds are added to grace the stock—four o’clocks; poppies, marigolds,\r\nand touch-me-nots. Our gardenwife is not so admirable for lily hands\r\nor fair face, or fairy form. She cannot walk over dewy flowers without\r\ncrushing them, as can a true heroine; for her specific gravity gives\r\nevidence of a good constitution, health and habits.\r\n\r\nHer praise is, that in a new country where woman unquestionably\r\nsuffers the most of hardships, she is cheerful, contented,\r\nindustrious, enterprising, and, like women the world over, seeks to\r\ndraw around herself objects of taste and beauty to decorate and cheer\r\nher husband’s and her children’s home; and, if necessary, to do it by\r\nthe field-labor of her own hands. We could not forbear saying so much\r\nof the meritorious gardener of more than half the rural gardens in the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThe seeds all mustered, she may be seen, after the breakfast things\r\nare all done up, busy with spade and hoe, hiding her treasures. And\r\nthus she does it. First a liberal suit of onion beds—savory vegetables\r\nto the tongue and most unsavory to the nose—making it almost\r\nimpossible for these respectable neighbors to live together in peace,\r\none or other of them being in bad odor with the other. Next, a\r\nseed-bed full of cabbages—significant to the imagination of cold-slaw,\r\nsourcrout, etc. A good row of peas, and a few hills of running beans\r\nare added. The alleys are ruffled with bush beans; a few early\r\npotatoes, some corn for roasting-ears, with a slender bed for beets,\r\ncomplete the stock of esculents. But sage, and summer savory, and\r\nthyme, and rue, and sweet marjoram, tansy, boneset and wormwood are\r\nattended to; a part for stuffing ducks and chickens—and the others for\r\ncuring those who have been too much stuffed _with_ them. The garden\r\nyields in due time its first fruits; the potatoes come and go, the\r\ncorn is early plucked, lettuce shoots up its seed-stalk, peas render\r\ntheir tribute and grow sere, beans rattle in the pod, and before\r\nAugust her work is done and her garden forsaken except a small retinue\r\nof flowers, which are nursed to the last. Weeds now make up for lost\r\ntime, and in a few weeks a weedy forest hides every trace of\r\ncultivation. This is not a fancy sketch; we have been far from drawing\r\na picture from the worst specimens; it is a fair average case.\r\n\r\nOur business is, not to quarrel with the farmer, but to suggest a\r\nbetter plan for his garden. We saw the plan stated some years ago;\r\nwhere, we have forgotten, but think well of it. It is simply this: let\r\nthe garden be an oblong—say three times as long as it is broad—and\r\ncultivate it with the _plow_. Instead of having beds, let all seeds be\r\nplanted in rows running the whole length of the garden. For example,\r\nbegin with one row of beets—or more if wanted; next a row or rows of\r\ncarrots, parsnips, cabbages, potatoes, corn, and all about three feet\r\napart. The same system should be followed for small fruits—currants,\r\ngooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, etc.—and it will have this\r\nadvantage over common gardens, that the bushes will have sun and air\r\non all sides, and be more fruitful and more healthy for it. The whole\r\ngarden, thus arranged, can be kept in order with very little labor. A\r\nsingle-horse plow will dress between the rows of the whole garden in a\r\nvery little time and save all hand-hoeing. The hand-weeding in the row\r\nmay be performed by women or children.\r\n\r\nIn large towns ground is scarce and labor abundant. Gardens,\r\ntherefore, are properly laid out for economy of space. In the country\r\nthe reverse is true; land is abundant but labor scarce and dear; of\r\ncourse gardens should be laid out not to save room, but to economize\r\nlabor. The plan suggested will save labor, improve the garden, and\r\ntake from the wife the drudgery of the spade and hoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DAYS OF SPRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the soil be thrown up during the open weather into ridges, an\r\nimmense number of insects will be unburrowed and destroyed; stiff\r\nclayey soils will be rendered more crumbling and mellow by exposure to\r\nfrost. If advantage is taken of the weather to haul manure, let it be\r\nstacked up, and a little earth thrown over it, else the volatile and\r\nmost valuable portions will escape. Ashes may be spread over the\r\ngarden; a small portion of refuse salt will benefit the ground, and\r\nmay be sown now. Clear the ground of all vines, stalks, haulm. If you\r\nhave flowering bulbs, cover slightly with coarse manure—they will not\r\nbe so much tried by the changes of temperature and moisture, and will\r\nflower stronger for it. Bright, dry days afford a fine time for going\r\nto the woods and cutting poles for your beans, stakes for your trees\r\nand dahlias, brush for peas, etc. While you are about it, collect moss\r\nfrom old logs, and put away in the barn or shed to cover the ground in\r\nsummer where roses and shrubs have been newly set out, and require to\r\nbe kept moist. If not done before, put two or three forks full of\r\ncoarse green manure about tender shrubs—Noisette and China roses.\r\nFreezing and thawing at the crown of the roots, destroys them oftener\r\nthan anything else.\r\n\r\nOn mild days when the earth is open, sow lettuce seed in a warm\r\ncorner, beat it gently with the back of the shovel, and cover it\r\nslightly with fine earth or old crumbling manure. You will have\r\nlettuce ten days earlier for your trouble. Pepper-grass and radishes\r\nmay be sowed in like manner.\r\n\r\n☞ Let alone the knife and saw. Your vines and trees will not be\r\nbenefited by any pruning at this season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLOR FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater freely such as are in pots, while in blossom. The flower stalks\r\nwill be apt to shoot up taller and weaker than in the garden, and will\r\nrequire rods to support them. Let the rod be thrust down about _two\r\ninches_ from the centre of the flower, and attach the flower stem to\r\nit by one or two ligaments. Flowers in small stove rooms can be kept\r\nin health with extreme difficulty. The heat forces their growth, or\r\ninjures the leaves. They should be washed off once a week (either on a\r\nmild day out of doors, or in a warm room within, if the weather be\r\nsevere), as the dust settles upon the leaf, and stops up the stomata\r\n(mouths) by which the leaf perspires and breathes. If green _aphides_\r\ninfest them, put a pan of coals beneath the stand, and throw on a\r\nhalf-handful of coarse tobacco. In half an hour every insect will\r\ntumble off. Let such as lie on the surface of the earth be removed or\r\ncrushed, as they will else revive. Plants should have _fresh air_\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SALT RECIPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a great fashion, now-a-days, in all papers, to set forth\r\nuseful recipes for every imaginable purpose. Every newspaper has its\r\nweekly budget of recipes. Our magazines have a page of original\r\nrecipes; and, before long, why should not the _North American Review_,\r\nor the _Edinburgh Review_ come out with their quarterly bill of fare\r\nreciped in full? So practical is our nineteenth century, that our\r\nliterary men and women feel it to be a solemn duty to indite novel\r\nrecipes for cooking, seasoning, removing stains, curing diseases,\r\netc.; and why not? If one can invent a sonnet, an elegy, or worse yet,\r\na poem, and thus draw people’s brains a wool-gathering in the regions\r\nof imagination, ought they not to atone for their license by an\r\ninvention equally substantial for the body? Miss Leslie writes a\r\nbeautiful story, and a recipe for manipulating lobsters. Miss\r\nMartineau writes travels, political economies and suggestions on plum\r\npudding. Mrs. Sigourney tunes her lyre with a hand most redolent of\r\npies, cakes and gingerbread. Such is the aspect of culinary affairs,\r\nand the rights of women, that the day seems at hand when no learning\r\nwill sustain a man, and no accomplishments a woman, who does not\r\nunderstand the art and mystery of cooking. It will be the duty of some\r\nfuture Heyne to give accurate recipes for all the feasts of Homer’s\r\nheroes, the ingredients of all the Horacian drinking-bouts—the dishes\r\nof Virgil’s fine fellows, as well as the minor matters of armor,\r\nlanguage, manners, and customs; and a good lexicon, Hebrew, Greek, or\r\nLatin, must contain clearly written recipes for all the dishes used by\r\nthe people whose language it sets forth. We have been led into this\r\ngrand prairie of reflections by a recipe found in a country paper\r\nwhich unquestionably is _salty_.\r\n\r\n“INDIAN BAKED PUDDING.—Indian pudding is good and wholesome, baked.\r\nScald a quart of milk, and stir in seven table spoonfuls of salt, a\r\ntea-cupful of molasses, and a great spoonful of ginger, or sifted\r\ncinnamon. Bake three or four hours. If you want whey you must be sure\r\nand pour in a little cold milk, after it is all mixed. Try it.”\r\n\r\nIf Misses Leslie, Childs, etc., refuse to mother such a recipe, with\r\n_no_ Indian meal in it, but _seven_ mortal spoonfuls of salt, then we\r\nwill consider it as emanating from Lot’s wife. We are sure if one\r\nshould eat many such puddings, he would speedily come to her estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURE OF CELERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know of no vegetable which requires more care and skill in its\r\ncultivation, from beginning to end, than celery. An inexperiened hand\r\nwill be apt to fail in planting his seed, fail in preparing the\r\ntrenches, and fail in earthing up the plants and bleaching them. And\r\nyet, celery is so generally a favorite that every family desires it,\r\nand every gardener is willing to cultivate it.\r\n\r\nSEED SOWING.—The seed is exceedingly slow in germination, and, if not\r\nassisted artificially, will lie three and sometimes four weeks without\r\nsprouting. We soak the seed in water, (a solution of oxalic acid would\r\nbe much better), for twenty-four hours: turn off the water, and then\r\nadd and stir up a few handfuls of sand, well moistened, and let the\r\nseed stand in a stove room or other warm place, for two or three days.\r\nThe sand will now be nearly dry; if it be not, add dry sand to it\r\nuntil it is perfectly powdery, and can be sown without falling in\r\nlumps. Besides hastening its germination, mixing the seed with sand\r\nenables the operator to sow it with greater facility and evenness.\r\nSelect a _shaded_ spot, let the earth be rich, rather inclined to\r\nmoisture, and perfectly mellow. Sow the seed broadcast, and cover\r\n_very thinly_ by sifting over it finely pulverized mold. Beat the bed\r\ngently with the back of the spade to settle the earth firmly about the\r\nseed. Don’t fear that the seed will be troubled by beating; every seed\r\nshould have the earth pressed to it by a smart stroke of the hoe,\r\nhand, spade, or by the pressure of a roller. If the weather is\r\nexceedingly warm and dry, cover your seed-bed with matting or old\r\ncarpet, to retain the moisture. When up let them be well weeded, until\r\nthey are six inches high, when they are to be removed to the trench\r\nfor blanching.\r\n\r\nFIRST TRANSPLANTING.—The process here detailed may be wholly omitted\r\nby those who are _obliged_ to economize time and labor. But those who\r\nwish to do the very best that can be done—who wish to avoid spindling,\r\nweak plants, and secure strong and vigorous ones—transplant their\r\ncelery to a level bed of very rich soil, placing the plants four\r\ninches apart every way. They are cultivated here for about five weeks,\r\nwhen they will have attained a robust habit, or, technically, they\r\nwill have became _stocky_—for which purpose they were thus\r\ntransplanted.\r\n\r\nCELERY TRENCHES.—Dig your trenches about eighteen inches wide, and one\r\nfoot deep, laying a shovelful of dirt alternately on each side of the\r\ntrench, that it may be conveniently drawn in on both sides when you\r\n_earth up_. If you are favored with a very deep and rich loamy soil,\r\nsuch as often abounds in Western gardens, you will need little or no\r\nmanure. But usually about four inches of _vegetable mold_ and very\r\n_thoroughly rotted_ manure, should be placed in the bottom of the\r\ntrench and gently spaded in. No part of the culture is more critical\r\nthan manuring. If the soil is slow, poor, and stingy, the celery will\r\nbe dwarfish, tough and strong. On the other hand, if you employ new,\r\nrank, fiery manure, although you will have a vigorous growth, the\r\nstalks will be hollow, watery, coarse and flavorless. Let the manure\r\nbe very thoroughly decayed and mixed half and half with leaf or\r\nvegetable mold.\r\n\r\nSet the plants five inches apart, water them freely with a fine rosed\r\nwatering pot, and, if the sun is fierce, cover the trenches daily from\r\nten A.M. till evening with boards. In about a week they will begin to\r\ngrow and will need no more shading.\r\n\r\nLet them alone, except to weed, until the plants are from twelve to\r\nfifteen inches high—at which time they are to be earthed up.\r\n\r\nEARTHING UP.—In dry weather, with a short, hand-hoe, draw in the earth\r\ngently from each side and bring it up carefully to the stalk. The soil\r\nmust be kept _out of the_ plant, and it is best for the first and\r\nperhaps the second time of earthing, to gather up the leaves in the\r\nleft hand, and holding them together, to draw the earth about them.\r\nFill in about once in two weeks, and _always when the plants are dry_.\r\nWhen the trench is full, the process is still to go on, and at the\r\nclose of the season your plants will be exactly reversed—instead of\r\nstanding in a trench they will top out from a high ridge.\r\n\r\nSAVING CELERY IN WINTER.—Three ways may be mentioned. Letting it stand\r\nin the trench—in which case it should be covered with long straw and\r\nboards so laid over it that it will be protected from the _wet_, which\r\nis supposed to be more prejudicial to it than mere cold.\r\n\r\nThe Boston market gardeners dig it late in autumn, trim off the\r\nfibrous roots, cut off the top, lay it for two days in an airy shed,\r\nturning it, say twice a day, and then pack it in layers of perfectly\r\n_dry_ sand, in a barrel. After laying two days to air it goes into the\r\nbarrel much wilted, but regains its plumpness, and comes out as fresh\r\nas from the trench.\r\n\r\nLastly, it may be put in rows on the cellar bottom, without trimming,\r\nand earth heaped up about it. Set a plank at an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees and bank up the earth against it, set a row of roots and cover\r\nthem with dirt, then another row and so on.\r\n\r\n_Solid_ celery is not a particular variety—any celery is solid when\r\nproperly grown—and if grown too rankly the most _solid_ celery in the\r\nworld will be hollow.\r\n\r\nWe have seen it recommended to water the trenches once or twice during\r\nthe season with a weak brine of salt and water. Besides the\r\nfertilizing effect of salt, it will have the effect of retaining\r\nmoisture in the soil, and what is of yet more moment, it destroys the\r\nparasitical fungus (_Puccinca Heraclei_) which attacks and rusts the\r\nplant, and probably would, also, guard it against a maggot which is\r\napt to infest and very much injure it. There is an insect, which, in\r\nvery dry weather, is apt to sting the leaf and cause it to wilt. While\r\nthe dew is on in the morning, sift lime over the plants once or twice,\r\nand it will check the fly.\r\n\r\nIf any think these directions too minute and the process vexatious,\r\nthey are at liberty to try a cheaper method—and may, once in a while,\r\nsucceed. But a certain crop, year by year, cannot be expected without\r\nexact and very careful cultivation. We have learned this by sorrowful\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe main crop of celery need not be placed in the trenches until the\r\nmiddle of July or the first of August. It’s greatest growth will be in\r\nthe fall months.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSEEDLING TREES.—Many trees which are entirely hardy when grown, are\r\nvery tender during the first and second winters. Cover them with\r\nstraw, refuse garden gatherings, leaves, etc. Sometimes it is best to\r\nraise them and _lay them in by the heels_, by which those gardeners\r\ndesignate the operation of laying trees in trenches or excavations,\r\nand covering the roots and a considerable portion of the stems. This\r\nwill not be extra labor in all cases when the young trees are to be\r\nreset, at any rate, the second year in nursery rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURE OF PIE-PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginners should in all cases, if possible, obtain a supply of plants,\r\nfrom a proved sort, by dividing the root. Raising from seed is an\r\nafter, and an amateur practice. The first object with every man is to\r\nsupply his family with this esculent, and not to experiment with new\r\nsorts. Let him buy or beg from garden or nursery, enough buds to\r\nestablish a bed, of some kind already known to be good.\r\n\r\nThe _best_ season of the year for dividing the root is in the spring;\r\nthe next best is in late autumn; and the worst in midsummer—as we have\r\nabundantly ascertained by experiment. The reason is plain. Like bulbs,\r\nand tubers, the root of the pie-plant stores up in itself during one\r\nseason, a supply of organizable matter enough to enable it to start\r\noff the next season, without any dependence upon the soil. Dahlias,\r\npotatoes, onions, turnips, cabbages, etc., it is well known, are able\r\nto grow for a considerable time, in the spring, without any connection\r\nwith the soil; being sustained by that supply which they had treasured\r\nup within themselves the previous autumn. When this is exhausted, they\r\nwill die, if they have not been put in connection with food from\r\nwithout. When pie-plant is divided in the spring, it is full of the\r\nmaterial of life, and a bud cut off from the main root with a portion\r\nof the root attached, has a supply of food until new roots are\r\nemitted, which in good soil and weather will be in about a week. There\r\nis the same vitality in autumn, and the only reason why it is not so\r\ngood for transplanting as spring, is the risk that the buds and roots\r\nwill rot off during the winter. A uniform winter will scarcely injure\r\none in a hundred, but constant changes, freezing and thawing, will\r\nweaken, if not destroy many of them. When, however, it is necessary to\r\ndivide and transplant in the fall, cover the bed full four inches deep\r\nwith coarse, strong manure. Although great care will enable one to\r\ntransplant a section of the root in midsummer, yet we have found that\r\nwhen no more attention is paid than in spring, nine plants are lost\r\nout of ten. The reason is obvious. There is no reserved treasure of\r\nsap in the root in summer, such as gives it vitality in spring or\r\nautumn. If for any reason we _must_ take up a root in summer, let\r\nevery possible fibre be saved, the plant well watered and sheltered\r\nuntil it begins to grow again.\r\n\r\nRAISING FROM SEED.—The origination of new varieties of fruits, flowers\r\nand esculent vegetables is one of the greatest rewards of gardening.\r\nAlmost every seed of the pie-plant will produce a variety. We have\r\nthought ourselves repaid for trouble if one in fifty seedling plants\r\nwere worth saving. It requires a full two years’ trial to improve a\r\nsort. Of fifty plants, say twenty-five may be rejected peremptorily\r\nthe first season, the petioles being mere wires. Of the other\r\ntwenty-five, one or two will give great promise, and the others will\r\nbe doubtful. Let them be transplanted in the spring of the second\r\nseason, into very mellow, rich, deep loam, full three feet apart every\r\nway, and here they may stand until the owner is fully satisfied, by\r\nthe trial of one or more seasons, which are good and which inferior.\r\nIn marking seedling plants, the cultivator should bear in mind that\r\nthere are _two_ kinds required, viz. a very early sort, and one for\r\nthe later and main supply. If a plant has small stalks, and is _late_\r\ntoo, reject it of course. If it be very _early_, it may be valuable\r\neven if quite small. Some sorts are fit for plucking five or six weeks\r\nbefore others; we have a variety which comes forward almost the moment\r\nthe frost leaves the ground in the spring, or in warm spells in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a late sort from your seedlings, several qualities must\r\nbe consulted. The plant should manifest an indisposition to go to\r\nseed; should be apt to throw out an _abundance_ of leaves, to supply\r\nthose taken off; the petioles should be large; the meat rich and\r\nsubstantial. There is great difference between one sort and another in\r\nthe amount of sugar required, in the delicacy of flavor, and in the\r\nproperty of stewing to a pulp, without wasting away.\r\n\r\nA good variety of pie-plant, then, should be a vigorous grower,\r\nprolific, large in the stalk, not apt to flower, of a sprightly acid\r\nwithout any earthy or woody taste, not stewing away more than\r\none-third when cooked, and not requiring too much sugar.\r\n\r\nWe have observed in our trials that seedlings having smooth leaves,\r\nwith the upper surface varnished and glossy, are seldom good; while\r\nevery plant which we have thought worth keeping, had the upper surface\r\nof its leaves of a deep, dull, lack-lustre green.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF A BED.—Select a strong and rich loam. Let it be spaded\r\nfull two feet deep. If the subsoil has never been worked, and is clay,\r\nor gravel, a large supply of old manure should be mixed with it. Our\r\nworking-method is this: Mark off the square, begin on one side, lay\r\nout a full spadeful of the top-soil clear across the bed; lay four or\r\nfive inches of manure in the trench, and then spade it down a full\r\ntwelve inches deep; beginning again by the side of the first trench,\r\nput the top-soil of the second into the first; add manure and spade as\r\nbefore; and so across the bed. The surface-soil thrown out of the\r\nfirst trench may be wheeled down and put into the _last_ one. This\r\nprocess will leave the bed much higher than it was; let it stand one\r\nor two weeks to settle. If the bed is prepared in autumn it will be\r\nbetter, and in the spring it may be half-spaded again before planting.\r\n\r\nMark out, by line, rows three feet apart, and set your plants in the\r\nrows three feet from plant to plant, if of the large kind, and two\r\nfeet, if of the small. Very large varieties require four feet every\r\nway. Tho buds should be left just below the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nAFTER CULTURE.—Through the summer keep the surface mellow and free\r\nfrom weeds. In the fall of the year, when the leaves show signs of\r\nfalling, form a compost heap of fine charcoal, if you can get it from\r\nblacksmith’s or elsewhere, vegetable mold, ashes, and very old manure.\r\nSpread and spade in a good coat of this, spading lightly near to the\r\nplants and deeply between them. When frost destroys the tops wholly,\r\ncover the bed with coarse, strong manure about four inches deep,\r\nsmooth it down, and let it remain thus. The next spring stir the\r\nsurface smartly with a rake, and no further care will be required\r\nexcept to pluck out any weeds that grow through the summer.\r\n\r\nGATHERING.—Leaves are constantly springing from the centre. Of course\r\nthe full-grown ones will be on the outside. These should be harvested,\r\nleaving the inside ones to mature. By going regularly over your bed,\r\nand taking in turn the outside leaves, a bed may be used till July\r\nwithout the slightest injury. Other fruit, after that time, usually\r\ndisplaces pie-plant and leaves it to rest the remainder of the year.\r\nThe leaf-stalks should not be _cut_ off. Slide the hand down as near\r\nas possible to the root, and give the stalk a backward and sidewise\r\nwrench and it will be detached at a joint or articulation, and no\r\nstump will be left to rot and injure the root—we usually cut off the\r\nleaves on the spot, leaving them about the root, both for shade to the\r\nground and for manure.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPRESERVE YOUR POT-PLANTS.—We warn ladies having pot-plants designed\r\nfor winter-wear, to be prudent _beforehand_, or some frosty night will\r\ncut every tender plant left out, and _then_ prudence will be good for\r\nnothing. Every one who pretends to keep parlor plants should own a\r\n_thermometer_. If at sundown or at nine o’clock it stands anywhere\r\nnear forty degrees, your plants are in danger. Sometimes it will fall,\r\nin one night, from fifty degrees to below thirty-two degrees, which\r\nlast is the freezing point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUN-FLOWER SEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo some extent this is likely to become a profitable crop. Medium\r\nlands will yield, on an average, fifty bushels; while first-rate lands\r\nwill yield from seventy to a hundred bushels.\r\n\r\nMODE OF CULTIVATION.—The ground is prepared in all respects as for a\r\ncorn crop, and the seed sown in drills four feet apart—one plant to\r\nevery eighteen inches in the drill. It is to be plowed and tended in\r\nall respects like a crop of corn.\r\n\r\nHARVESTING.—As the heads ripen, they are gathered, laid on a barn\r\nfloor and threshed with a flail. The seed shells very easily.\r\n\r\nUSE.—The seed may be employed in fattening hogs, feeding poultry,\r\netc., and for this last purpose it is better than grain. But the seed\r\nis more valuable at the _oil-mill_ than elsewhere. It will yield a\r\ngallon to the bushel without trouble; and by careful working, more\r\nthan this. Hemp yields one and a fourth gallons to the bushel, and\r\nflax-seed one and a half by ordinary pressure; but two gallons under\r\nthe hydraulic press.\r\n\r\nThe oil has, as yet, no established market price. It will range from\r\nseventy cents to a dollar, according as its value shall be established\r\nas an article for lamps and for painters’ use. But at seventy cents a\r\ngallon for oil, the seed would command fifty-five cents a bushel,\r\nwhich is a much higher price than can be had for corn.\r\n\r\nIt is stated, but upon how sufficient proof we know not, that\r\nsun-flower oil is excellent for burning in lamps. It has also been\r\ntried by our painters to some extent; and for _inside_ work, it is\r\nsaid to be as good as linseed oil. Mr. Hannaman, who has kindly put us\r\nin possession of these facts, says, that the oil resembles an\r\n_animal_, rather than a vegetable oil; that it has not the _varnish_\r\nproperties of the linseed oil. We suppose by varnish is meant, the\r\nalbumen and mucilage which are found in vegetable oils. The following\r\nanalysis of _hemp-seed_, and _flax-seed_, or as it is called in\r\nEngland lint or linseed, will show the proportions of various\r\ningredients in one hundred parts.\r\n\r\n                             Hemp-seed.

All oils may, therefore, the less excellent\r\nthey are for painting, be regarded as the more valuable for burning.\r\n_Rape-seed_ is extensively raised in Europe, chiefly in Flanders, for\r\nits oil, and is much used for burning. Ten quarts may be extracted\r\nfrom a bushel of seed. We append a table representing the richness of\r\nvarious seeds, etc., in oil.\r\n\r\n                           Oil per cent.\r\n  Linseed (flax)              11 to 22\r\n  Hemp-seed,                  14 to 25\r\n  Rape-seed,                  40 to 70\r\n  Poppy-seed,                 36 to 33\r\n  White mustard-seed,         36 to 48\r\n  Black mustard-seed,         15\r\n  Swedish turnip-seed,        34\r\n  Sun-flower seed,            15\r\n  Walnut kernels              40 to 70\r\n  Hazel-nut kernels,          60\r\n  Beech-nut kernels,          15 to 17\r\n  Plum-stone  do.             33\r\n  Sweet almond kernels,       40 to 54\r\n  Bitter  do.    do.          28 to 46\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL GARDEN-WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one will now be at work in the garden. A few suggestions may\r\nmake your garden better.\r\n\r\nPLOWING GARDENS.—We do not like the practice except when the garden is\r\nlarge, and the owner unable to meet the expense of _spading_. But if\r\nyou must plow, let that be well done. Those contemptible little\r\none-horse plows, with which most gardens are plowed, should be\r\ndiscarded. The best plowing will be too shallow, but these spindling\r\nlittle plows, drawn by a little meagre horse, will skim over your\r\nground, averaging from three to four inches deep, and preparing your\r\nsoil to receive the utmost possible detriment from summer droughts.\r\nWhat chance have young roots, or the finer fibres of plants, to\r\npenetrate more than a few inches of surface-soil? Persons come to our\r\ngarden and wonder why some vegetables flourish so well, while they\r\nnever have luck with them, “It must be a difference of soil.” No, it\r\nis the difference of working it. Give your vegetables a chance to\r\ndescend eighteen or twenty inches if they incline to it, and you will\r\nhave no more trouble. A large plow should be used, and you should\r\nstand by and _see_ that it is _put in to the beam_. A garden soil is\r\nusually mellow, and a plow can go to its full depth without hurting\r\nthe horses.\r\n\r\nSPADING.—This mode of working the ground will always be employed by\r\nthose ambitious of having a _first-rate_ garden. Indeed, where there\r\nis much shrubbery and permanent beds, as of asparagus, pie-plant,\r\nstrawberry, and plantations of currants, raspberries, etc., spading is\r\nthe only method which _can_ be employed.\r\n\r\nSPADING SHRUBBERY.—Let very fine manure be spread about roses,\r\nhoneysuckles, and ornamental shrubs (where they are not standing in a\r\ngrass-lawn). Beginning at the plant, with great care turn over the\r\nsoil one or two inches deep, yet so as not to injure the fibres;\r\ngradually deepen the stroke of your spade as you go out from the\r\nplant; at two feet from the shrub you may put in the spade half its\r\ndepth, and at three feet to its full depth. You will of course cut\r\nmany roots, but they will very soon re-form and send out fibres, and\r\nby the manure spaded in, be supplied with abundant nourishment for the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nSPADING FLOWER BEDS.—This requires a practised hand. There is danger\r\nof wounding and displacing clumps of flower-roots, or of filling the\r\ncrowns with dirt, or of leaving the surface uneven, and the edges\r\nragged. If there is a skillful gardener to be had, hire it done, and\r\nwatch while he performs, for any man who has seen a thing done in a\r\ngarden once, ought to be ashamed if he cannot himself do it\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nSPADING VEGETABLE BEDS.—Asparagus, pie-plant, strawberries, etc.,\r\nrequire enriching every year, and to have the manure forked or spaded\r\nin. It is easy to perform this upon strawberries, and a spade is\r\npreferable. A three or four-pronged fork is better for asparagus and\r\npie-plant. Be careful not to tear or cut the crowns of the plants. No\r\nmaterial injury ensues from clipping the side fibres, _in the spring_;\r\nin summer, when a plant requires all its mouths to supply sap for its\r\nextended surface of leaf, it is not wise to cut the roots or fibres at\r\nall, but only to keep the surface mellow and friable.\r\n\r\nDEEP SPADING.—Ames’ garden-spades measure twelve inches in length of\r\nblade. In a good soil the foot may gain one or two additional inches\r\nby a good thrust. Thus the soil is mellowed to the depth of fourteen\r\ninches. This will do very well; but if you aspire to do the very best,\r\nanother course must be first pursued. The first spadeful must be\r\nthrown out, and a second depth gained, and then the top soil returned.\r\nThis is comparatively slow and laborious, but it need not be done more\r\nthan once in five years, and by dividing the garden into sections, and\r\nperforming this _thorough-spading_ on one of the sections each year,\r\nthe process will be found, practically, less burdensome than it seems\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING POOR ON RICH LAND AND RICH ON POOR LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nA close observer of men and things told us the following little\r\nhistory, which we hope will plow very deeply into the attention of all\r\nwho plow very shallow in their soils.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers settled together in —— county. One of them on a cold,\r\nugly, clay soil, covered with black-jack oak, not one of which was\r\nlarge enough to make a half dozen rails. This man would never drive\r\nany but large, powerful, Conastoga horses, some seventeen hands high.\r\nHe always put _three_ horses to a large plow, and plunged it in some\r\nten inches deep. This deep plowing he invariably practised and\r\ncultivated thoroughly afterward. He raised his seventy bushels of corn\r\nto the acre.\r\n\r\nThis man had a brother about six miles off, settled on a rich White\r\nRiver bottom-land farm—and while a black-jack clay soil yielded\r\nseventy bushels to the acre, this fine bottom-land would not average\r\nfifty. One brother was steadily growing rich on poor land, and the\r\nother steadily growing poor on rich land.\r\n\r\nOne day the bottom-land brother came down to see the black-jack oak\r\nfarmer, and they began to talk about their crops and farms, as farmers\r\nare very apt to do.\r\n\r\n“How is it,” said the first, “that you manage on this poor soil to\r\nbeat me in crops?”\r\n\r\nThey reply was “_I_ WORK _my land_.”\r\n\r\nThat was it, exactly. Some men have such rich land that they won’t\r\n_work_, it; and they never get a step beyond where they began. They\r\nrely on the _soil_, not on labor, or skill, or care. _Some men expect\r\ntheir_ LANDS _to work, and some men expect to_ WORK THEIR LAND;—and that\r\nis just the difference between a good and a bad farmer.\r\n\r\nWhen we had written thus far, and read it to our informant, he said,\r\n“three years ago I travelled again through that section, and the only\r\ngood farm I saw was this very one of which you have just written. All\r\nthe others were desolate—fences down—cabins abandoned, the settlers\r\ndiscouraged and moved off. I thought I saw the same old stable door,\r\nhanging by one hinge, that used to disgust me ten years before; and I\r\nsaw no change except for the worse in the whole county, with the\r\nsingle exception of this one farm.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING READY FOR WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaul tanbark and bank up around the house to insure a warm cellar.\r\nCellar windows should be kept open through the day, and closed after\r\nthe nights begin to freeze, as late in the season as possible. See\r\nthat dry walks are prepared from the house to all the out-houses. Do\r\nnot be stingy of your materials; make the paths high and rounding, so\r\nas to insure dryness, especially about the barn. See that stones,\r\ngravel, or timber are laid so as to be out of the way of cattle’s\r\nfeet, and just in the way of your own. We have seen swamp-barn-yards,\r\nbefore going into which a prudent man would choose to make his will.\r\nMud on the shoes from roads and fields is all well enough; but mud\r\nfrom one’s own yards, shows that the owner has not fixed up as he\r\nought to have done.\r\n\r\nIf your stables are old, examine the floor; or some night may let a\r\nhorse through, to come out lame for life. If you have a dirt floor,\r\nsee that it is carefully laid, and remember that if it be inclined\r\neither way, it should be _from_ the rack and not _toward_ it. Let your\r\nwagons, carts, plows, etc., be repaired during the fall and winter,\r\nand not be left till spring. See that your shingles are all sound on\r\nthe house, barn, and shed. The leak which you have allowed to drop,\r\ndrop, drop all summer has at last taken off a yard or two of plaster,\r\nand it is time now to put on a shingle or two. There is another leak\r\nor two that _must_ be stopped. That pocket of yours which has let out\r\ndime after dime for liquor, the hole getting bigger and bigger every\r\nyear, now is the time to sow _it_ up, or it will rip _you_ up. A\r\npocket is a small place, to be sure, but we have seen barns, cattle,\r\nand acre after acre slip through a hole in it which, at first, was\r\nonly large enough to let sixpence through.\r\n\r\nSee that all your tools have a safe and dry standing-place; hoes,\r\nrakes, scythes, sickles, yokes, spades, shovels, chains, pins,\r\nharrows, plows, carts, and sleds, axes, mattocks, hammers, and\r\neverything, but your geese and ducks, should be kept from wet and\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nIf you have no stables for your cattle, you should have good sheds\r\nprovided, opening to the south. Even when cattle are allowed to run\r\nthrough the stock-fields, there ought to be in some warm place an\r\nample shed to which they can resort during wet and cold weather; and\r\none sufficiently snug can be made without calling in the carpenter or\r\nbuying lumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCULENT VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe mention some of the more common kinds of garden esculent\r\nvegetables, to point out the best kinds, and give some hints for their\r\ncultivation. If more vegetables were raised and eaten in the place of\r\nmeat, there would be fewer diseases, and less expense for medicine\r\nthan is now the case among those who eat so heartily and liberally of\r\nthe _fat_ of the land.\r\n\r\nBEET.—The turnip-rooted blood beet should be sown for the earliest\r\ncrop; the long blood beet for the late crop, and for winter use. The\r\n_blood beet_ is the proper garden beet. The _scarcity_, the sugar\r\nbeets (so called), white, yellow, and red, are inferior for table use.\r\nEvery year we see accounts of new varieties, which are seldom\r\nmentioned a second time, while these old standard sorts hold their own\r\nfrom year to year. We see people running around among their neighbors\r\nfor _beet_-seed, careless whether it is early or late, coarse fleshed\r\nor fine grained, sweet or insipid. It is just as easy and cheap to\r\nhave the best seed of the best kinds, as to have refuse seed of\r\nworthless kinds. Lately, a variety introduced from France, called\r\n_Bassano_, has attracted attention and commendation.[11] It is early,\r\ntender, and sweet. If you attempt to raise your own seed, let only\r\n_one_ sort stand in the garden; otherwise bees and other insects will\r\nmix them, and the purity of the variety will be lost. We very seldom\r\nsee an unmixed variety in common gardens, unless seed have been bought\r\nfrom good seedsmen.\r\n\r\nThe best seed is a small black seed about the size of a pin head,\r\nenveloped in a ragged, rough, two or three lobed husk. Every _seeming_\r\nseed planted, then, is a mere envelope of two or more seeds, and two\r\nor three plants come up, very much to the surprise of the\r\ninexperienced, for each husk. When a little advanced, they are to be\r\nthinned out to one in a place.\r\n\r\nWe prefer planting very early, and in rows eight inches apart and at\r\nabout _one inch_ distant in the row. As the plants begin to gain size\r\nthey make very delicate greens; and for this purpose are to be boiled,\r\nleaf, root, and all. Continue to thin out until one is left for every\r\nsix inches for full growth.\r\n\r\nEvery year a great ado is made about monstrous beets—twenty and thirty\r\npounders. There is no objection to these giants, unless they beget an\r\nidea that _size_ is the test of merit. For table-use, _medium sized_\r\nfruits and vegetables are every way preferable; a beet should never be\r\nlarger than a goose-egg.\r\n\r\nIt is equally foolish to suppose that large, coarse-grained\r\nvegetables, whether potatoes, beets, parsnips, ruta bagas, or anything\r\nelse, are as good for stock, though not so palatable to men. To be\r\nsure they fill up. But that which is nutriment to man is nutriment to\r\nbeast; a vegetable which is rank and watery is no better for my cow\r\nthan for us. It is not the _bulk_ but the _quality_ that measures the\r\nfitness of articles for food.\r\n\r\nPARSNIP.—This vegetable is, to those who are fond of it, very\r\ndesirable, as coming in at a time when other things are failing. For,\r\nalthough the parsnip attains its size by autumn, yet its flavor seems\r\nto depend upon its receiving a pretty good frosting. It may be dug at\r\nopen spells through the winter and early in the spring. It gives one\r\nof the first indications of returning warmth, and its green leaves are\r\namong the first which cheer the garden. On this account it must be dug\r\nearly in the spring and housed, or it will spoil by growth.\r\n\r\nWe know of no difference in varieties. The _Guernsey_, is not a\r\ndifferent sort from the common, but only the common sort, very highly\r\ncultivated in that island, where it sometimes grows to a length of\r\nfour feet. The _hollow-crowned_ and _Siam_ are mentioned in English\r\ncatalogues, as fine fleshed and flavored, but we have never been able\r\nto obtain seed of them.\r\n\r\nThe parsnip (_Pastinacea sativa_) is a native of Great Britain and is\r\nfound wild by the road-sides, delighting particularly in calcareous\r\nsoils. It has hitherto been supposed that the seed would not retain\r\nits germinating power more than one year, but Mr. Mendenhall states\r\nthat he has raised freely from four year old seed. The parsnip is much\r\nsown as a field crop at the east, yielding 1,000 bushels, on good\r\nland, to the acre. They are invaluable both to cows and horses. The\r\nquantity and quality of milk in cows is improved; and no farmer with\r\nwhom butter-making is a considerable object of interest, should be\r\nwithout a root crop—beet, carrot, or ruta baga.\r\n\r\nCARROT. (_Daucus carota_).—This is a native of Great Britain. The\r\nearly horn and Altringham are the best varieties sold by our seedsmen.\r\nBeside their use upon the table, they are largely and deservedly\r\ncultivated in the field for stock. A horse becomes more fond of them\r\nthan of oats, and they do not, like the potato, require boiling before\r\nfeeding out. A thousand bushels may be raised to the acre. The premium\r\nof the New York Agricultural Society for the year 1844, was to a crop\r\nof 1,059 bushels the acre. The seed should be new each year, as it\r\nwill not come well even the second year, and not at all if kept yet\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nRADISH.—Every garden has its bed of radishes, and they are among the\r\nfirst spring gifts. They will grow in any soil, but not in all equally\r\nwell. A mellow sandy loam is best; or rather that soil is best which\r\nwill grow them the quickest. If they are a long time in growing, they\r\nare tough and stringy. It is said that a compost of the following\r\nmaterials will produce them very early and finely. Take equal parts of\r\nbuckwheat bran and fresh horse-dung, dig them in plentifully into the\r\nsoil where you intend to sow. Within two days a plentiful crop of\r\ntoadstools will start up. Spade them under, and sow your seed, and the\r\nradishes will come forward rapidly, and be tender and free from worms.\r\n\r\nThe _short-top scarlet_, is the best for spring planting. It is so\r\nnamed, because, from its rapid growth the top is yet small when the\r\nroot is fit for the table. There is a white and red turnip-rooted\r\nvariety, also good for spring use. The turnip-rooted kinds have not\r\nonly the shape, but something of the sweetness and flavor of the\r\nturnip, and are by some preferred to all others. For summer planting,\r\nthere is a yellow turnip-rooted sort and the summer white. For fall\r\nand early winter, the white and black Spanish are planted. When\r\nradishes are sown broadcast, it must be very thinly, for if at all\r\ncrowded they run to top, and refuse to form edible roots. For our own\r\nuse, we sow on the edges of beds, devoted to onions, beets, etc., and\r\nthrust each seed down with the finger.\r\n\r\nThe radish (_Raphanus sativus_) is a native of China, and was\r\nintroduced to England before 1584.\r\n\r\nSALSIFY, OR VEGETABLE OYSTER.—We esteem this to be a much better root\r\nfor table use than either the parsnip or carrot. It is cultivated in\r\nall respects as these crops are. Some have been skeptical as to their\r\npossessing an oyster flavor. They seldom attain the true taste until,\r\nlike the parsnip, they have been well frosted. But if dug up during\r\nspells in winter and early in the spring, and cooked by an orthodox\r\nformula, they are strikingly like the oyster. We have just consulted\r\nthe oracle of our kitchen, and give forth the following method of\r\ncooking it: First, oblige your husband to raise a good supply of them.\r\nWhen you have obtained them, scrape off the outside skin—cut the root\r\nlengthwise into thin slices—put them into a spider and just cover with\r\nhot water. Let them boil until a fork will pass through them easily.\r\nWithout turning off the water, season them with butter, pepper, and\r\nsalt, and sprinkle in a little flour—enough to thicken the liquor\r\nslightly. Then eat them.\r\n\r\nThe success of this gustatory deception depends, more than anything\r\nelse, upon the skill in seasoning. If well done they are not merely an\r\napology, but they are a very excellent substitute for the shell-fish\r\nhimself; a thousand times better than pickled can-oysters—those arrant\r\nlibels upon all that is dear in the remembrance of a live oyster.\r\n\r\nEvery one may save seed for himself, as it will not, if well\r\ncultivated, degenerate. It is a biennial, and roots may either be set\r\nout, or left standing where they were planted. When the seed begins to\r\nfeather out it must be immediately gathered, or like the dandelion or\r\nthistle, it will be blown away by the wind. This vegetable should be\r\nmuch more extensively cultivated than it is.\r\n\r\nBEANS.—There are three kinds—English dwarf; kidney dwarf or string,\r\nand the pole beans. The first kind, so far as our experience has gone,\r\nare coarser than the others, and, in our hot and dry summers, are very\r\ndifficult to raise.\r\n\r\nOf kidney or bush beans, there is a long catalogue of sorts. The\r\n_Mohawk_ is good for its hardiness, enduring spring frosts with\r\ncomparative impunity. The _red-speckled valentine_ is highly\r\ncommended. But after a trial of some twenty kinds, we are entirely\r\ncontented with one—the _China red-eye_. It is early, hardy, very\r\nprolific, and well flavored.\r\n\r\nOf the pole beans, one sort, the _Lima_, might supersede all others\r\nwere it a little earlier. It is immensely prolific, its flavor\r\nunrivalled, and nearly the same in the dry bean as when cooked in its\r\ngreen state, a quality which has never, we believe, been found in any\r\nother variety. To supply the deficiency of this variety in earliness,\r\nwe know of none equal to the _Horticultural_. With these two kinds one\r\nhas no need of any other. Pole beans will not bear frost, and are\r\namong the last seeds to be planted, seldom before the last of April.\r\nThe bush-bean may precede them a fortnight.\r\n\r\nThe English dwarf (_Vicia faba_) is a native of Egypt; but has been\r\ncultivated in England from time immemorial, and, it is supposed, was\r\nintroduced by the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe kidney dwarf (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) is a native of India, and was\r\nintroduced into England about the year 1597.\r\n\r\nThe pole bean (_Phaseolus multifloris_) is a native of South America,\r\nand was introduced to England in 1633.\r\n\r\nPole beans are not strictly annuals. In a climate where the winter\r\ndoes not destroy them they bear again the second year, and we believe\r\nyet longer. Gov. Pinney, of Liberia, on the African coast, stated in a\r\nlecture, speaking of the vegetable productions of that region, that\r\nthe bean was a permanent vine like the grape, bearing its crops from\r\nyear to year without replanting. The bush bean is strictly an annual.\r\nIf the pole bean were protected in the ground, or raised and put away\r\nlike sweet potatoes, dahlias, etc., in the cellar and replanted in the\r\nspring it would bear again the second season. Perhaps an earlier crop\r\nof beans might thus be secured.\r\n\r\nThe bean crop, by field culture, is not to be overlooked. Great\r\nquantities of dried beans are consumed by families, by the army and in\r\nthe navy, and they always bear a good price, when they are well grown\r\nand well cured. They are excellent for sheep, not from their fattening\r\nproperties, but for improving their fleece. Analysis has shown them to\r\nbe rich in those properties which are “wool-gathering.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     [11] A new variety called the _Bassano_ has been recently\r\n     introduced into France, and extensively cultivated; and it\r\n     is said to be found in all the markets from Venice to Genoa,\r\n     in the month of June. It is remarkable for the form of the\r\n     root, which is flattened like a turnip. The skin is red, the\r\n     flesh white, veined with rose. It is very tender, very\r\n     delicate, preserving its rose colored rings after cooking,\r\n     and from two to two and a half inches in diameter. This\r\n     description is from the _Bon Jardinier_ for 1841. The\r\n     edition for 1842 states that this variety is highly esteemed\r\n     in the north of Italy, and that it is, in fact, one of the\r\n     best kinds for the table.—_Hovey’s Magazine._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD ROOT CROPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom mid-winter, and especially _just before_ spring opens, beets,\r\ncarrots, parsnips, potatoes, ruta baga, and mangel wurtzel are of the\r\nhighest utility. After months of dry fodder, and of slops thickened\r\nwith corn-meal, cattle need—their stomach, their blood need—a change\r\nof diet; and none can be better than roots. At the East it is no\r\nlonger a debatable question—root crops are as regularly laid in as\r\ngrain or grass crops. The chief difficulty at the East, in introducing\r\n“new-fangled notions,” arises from the regular routine habits of\r\nfarmers and their settled aversion to change from old ways. Very\r\nlittle of this spirit exists at the West. There the very essence of\r\nlife is _change_. The population have broken up from old homesteads,\r\nmoved off from old States, abandoned the comforts and settled life of\r\nlong tilled agricultural districts—to come into a new country, where\r\nthey _have_ to practise new ways, live differently, and labor by new\r\nmethods; and, by consequence, the farming community of the West are\r\nremarkably free to meet and adopt agricultural improvements. But the\r\ndifficulty lies in a different direction. The farmers have large\r\nfarms—are ambitious of large crops, large herds of cattle, large\r\ndroves of hogs, and of a style of husbandry which brings in a large\r\npile, and all at once; so that the idea of _good_ farming is _large_\r\nfarming. Many a sturdy Kentuckian will very patiently plow, two or\r\nthree times, his fifty or hundred acres of corn, and think nothing of\r\nit; but to put in half an acre of carrots, or beets, to weed and work,\r\nto harvest and store the vexatious little crop, this seems a piddling\r\nbusiness. Our big prairie farmers, our heavy bottom-land farmers, our\r\nstock farmers who “hog” one or two hundred acres of corn, of their own\r\nplanting or of their neighbor’s, they do not love _little_ work. We\r\nknow a man who lives on thirty acres of land of about a middling\r\nquality. He winters seven cows, two horses, and two pigs. He raises\r\ncorn and grass enough for his own use, and sells none. Every year he\r\nputs in about a quarter of an acre of parsnips, or ruta baga, for\r\nwinter and spring fodder. His garden in summer, and his dairy all the\r\nyear round, are represented in market. He probably does not receive\r\nfive dollars at _once_, on any one sale, through the year. We never\r\nlooked into that old chest under his bed; but we will venture much,\r\nthat if the shrewd housewife would keep her eagle eyes off long enough\r\nto give us a chance, it would be found that this man has made, and\r\nlaid up, more money in the last five years from his thirty acres, than\r\nany farmer about here from six times the amount. Our farmers _have not\r\ngrown rich on large and careless farming; but many are growing rich on\r\nsmall farms and careful husbandry_.\r\n\r\nWhen the dairy shall be more thought of—when wintering stock, and\r\nfattening it, shall be more carefully studied—we predict that our\r\nfarmers will annually raise thousands of bushels of roots, and have\r\ncapacious cellars under their barns to store them in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF FRUIT-TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must give up thinking of _remedies_ for blights and diseases of\r\nfruit-trees and seek after _preventives_. Amputation may limit its\r\nravages; but surgery is not a remedy, but a resource after remedies\r\nfail. We must, it seems to us, look for a preventive in a wiser system\r\nof fruit cultivation. To this subject we shall now speak.\r\n\r\nThe effect of cultivation in changing the habits of plants is familiar\r\nto all. Incident to this artificial condition of the plant, there will\r\nbe new diseases, vegetable vices, which, as they result from\r\ncultivation, must be regarded in every perfect system of cultivation.\r\n\r\nWhere trees are grown for timber, or shade, or ornament, everything\r\ncan be sacrificed to the production of wood and foliage. But in\r\nfruit-trees wood is nothing and fruit is everything. We push for\r\n_quantity_ and _quality_ of fruit; and would not regard the wood or\r\nfoliage at all, if it were not indispensable as a means of procuring\r\nfruit. That is the most skillful treatment of fruit-trees which\r\ninvolves a just compromise between the wants of the _tree_, and the\r\nabundance and excellence of _fruit_. There is a way of gaining fruit\r\nby a rapid consumption of the tree; and there is a method of gaining\r\nfruit by invigorating and prolonging the tree. Two systems of\r\ncultivation grow out of these different methods—a natural system and\r\nan artificial system. All _cultivation_ is artificial, even the\r\nrudest. By natural system, then, is only meant a treatment which\r\ninterferes but _little_ with nature; and by artificial, a system in\r\nwhich skill is applied to every part of the vegetable economy. For\r\nconservatories, gardens, and experimental grounds, there is no reason\r\nwhy an artificial system should not exist. Moral considerations\r\nrestrain us from stimulating a man or a beast to procure a quick or a\r\nlarge return at the expense of life and limb; but in vegetable matters\r\nour _preference_ or interest is the only restraint. If any reason\r\nexists for forcing a tree to bear young, and enormously, and after ten\r\nyears’ service for throwing it away, it is proper to do it. For larger\r\nshow-fruit we _ring_ a limb expecting to sacrifice the branch; we\r\ndiminish the life of the pear by putting it to a dwarf habit by\r\nviolent means. If we have any sufficiently desirable object to\r\naccomplish, there is no reason why we should not do it. There may be\r\nas good reasons for limiting a tree to ten years as a strawberry bed\r\nto three.\r\n\r\nThere is another form of the artificial system in which there _is_\r\nmuch to censure. When fruit-trees are set in gardens, yards, etc., to\r\nbe permanent, and _long-lived_, it is folly to apply to them that\r\nhigh-toned treatment which belongs to an artificial system as I have\r\nspoken of it above. Impatient of delay, the cultivator presses his\r\ntrees forward by stimulating applications, or retards them by violent\r\ninterference—by prunings at the root or branch, by bending or binding;\r\neverything is sacrificed for early and abundant bearing. Fine fruit\r\nyards, designed to last a hundred years, are served with a treatment\r\nproper only to a conservatory or experimental garden. This high-toned\r\nsystem is still more vicious when applied to orchards and especially\r\nto pear orchards; and it seems to us that much is to be learned and\r\nmuch unlearned before we shall have attained a true science of pear\r\nculture. Let us consider some facts. It is well known that seedling\r\napple-trees are generally longer lived than grafted varieties, and\r\nobnoxious to fewer diseases. The same is true of the pear-tree. It has\r\nfrequently been said that _seedling_ and _wilding_ pears were not\r\nsubject to the blight. This is not true if such trees are undergoing\r\nthe same cultivation as grafted sorts; it is not always true when they\r\nexist in an untutored state; but when they are left to themselves,\r\nthey certainly are _less_ obnoxious to the blight and to disease of\r\nany kind, than are grafted and cultivated varieties. A comparison\r\nbetween wild and tame, between cultivated and natural, between\r\nseedling and grafted fruit, is certainly to the advantage of seedling\r\nuncultivated fruit, _in respect to the HEALTH of the tree_—of course\r\nit is not in respect to quality of fruit. In connection with these\r\nfacts, consider another, that seedling and wilding fruit is nearly\r\ntwice as long in coming into bearing as are cultivated varieties. The\r\nseedling apple bears at from ten to fourteen years. The pear bears at\r\nfrom fifteen to eighteen years. But upon cultivation the grafted pear\r\nand apple bear in from five to eight years. It is noticeable that,\r\nalthough the pear as a wilding is four or five years longer in coming\r\nto a bearing state than the apple, yet, upon cultivation, they both\r\nbear at about the same age from the bud or graft. In a private letter\r\nfrom Robert Manning (we prize it as among the last he ever wrote;\r\nanother, received not long after, was _dictated_; but signed by his\r\ntremulous hand in letters which speak of death), he says, “_Pears bear\r\nas soon as apples of the same age_; on the quince much sooner,” etc.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that while cultivation accelerates the period of\r\nfruit-bearing and perfects the fruit, it is also accompanied with\r\npremature age and liability to diseases. We do not wish to be\r\nunderstood as opposing the habit of _cultivating_ fruit, or as\r\nprejudiced against grafted varieties—we are neither opposed to the one\r\nnor to the other. But we would deduce from facts, some conclusions\r\nwhich will enable us to perfect our fruits by a more discriminating\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThe question will arise, Is it only by accident that liability to\r\ndisease increases, with increase of cultivation? Is there an\r\n_inherent_ objection in _all_ artificial treatment? or is there\r\nobjection only to particular methods of artificial cultivation?\r\n\r\nAlthough there may be too many exceptions, to allow of our saying,\r\nthat quickly-growing timber is not durable, it may be said in respect\r\nto trees of the same species, that the durability of the timber\r\ndepends (among other things) on the slowness of its growth. Mountain\r\ntimber is usually tougher and more lasting than champaign wood; timber\r\ngrowing in the great alluvial valleys of the West, is notoriously more\r\nperishable than that grown in the parsimonious soils of the North and\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThe reason does not seem obscure. In a rich soil, and under an ardent\r\nsun, not only is the growth of trees greater in any given season, than\r\nin a poor soil, but the growth is coarser and the grain coarser. But\r\nwhat is a _coarse_ growth, and what is fine-grained, or coarse-grained\r\ntimber?—timber in which the vascular system has been greatly\r\ndistended, in which sap-vessels and air-cells are large and coarse.\r\nWhere wood is formed with great rapidity and with a super abundance of\r\nsap, not only will there be large ducts and vessels, but the sap\r\nitself will be but imperfectly elaborated by the leaves. We may\r\nsuppose that overfeeding in vegetables is, in its effects, analogous\r\nto overfeeding in animals. The sap is but imperfectly decomposed in\r\nthe leaf—it passes into the channels for elaborated sap in a partially\r\nundigested state—it deposits imperfect secretions, and the whole\r\ntissue resulting from it will partake of the defects of the _proper\r\njuice_.[12]\r\n\r\nThus a too rapid growth not only enlarges the sap passages, but forms\r\ntheir sides and the whole vegetable tissue of imperfect matter. This\r\naccounts, not only for the perishableness of quickly-grown timber,\r\nbut, doubtless, for the short-lived tendency of cultivated fruit in\r\ncomparison with _wildings_. For where the tissue is imperfectly\r\nformed, general weakness must ensue.\r\n\r\nThese reasonings do not include plants which, in their original\r\nnature, have a system of large sap-vessels, etc., and which naturally\r\nare rapid growers, but respects only plants which have been forced to\r\nthis condition by circumstances.\r\n\r\nHas this condition of the vegetable substance nothing to do with the\r\nhealth of a tree? Does it not very much determine its liability to\r\ndisease?—its excitability? Where are trees liable to diseases of the\r\ncirculation? In England, in New England, where, by climate and soil,\r\ngrowth is slow?—or in the Western and Middle States, where, by\r\nclimate, by soil, and by vicious treatment, the growth is excessive?\r\nThis leads me to review the methods employed in rearing fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nThe nursery business is a commercial business, and aims at _profit_.\r\nIt is the interest of nurserymen to sell largely, and to bring their\r\ntrees into market in the shortest possible time from the planting of\r\nthe seed and the setting of the bud, to the sale of the tree. But\r\nindependently of this, few nurserymen know, accurately, the nature of\r\nthe plants which they cultivate, and still less the habits of each\r\nvariety. Why should they, when learned pomologists are content to know\r\nas little as they? The trees are highly cultivated and closely\r\nside-pruned. The _vigor_ of a tree, _i. e._ the rapidity with which it\r\nwill grow, determines its favor. Sorts which take time, and require a\r\nlonger treatment, are regarded with disfavor. Everything is sacrificed\r\nto rapid growth and early maturity.\r\n\r\nNext, and proceeding in the same evil direction, comes the orchard\r\ncultivation. From what quarter have we, mostly, derived our opinions\r\nand practices in fruit cultivation? From French, English, and New\r\nEngland writers. But is the system which they pursue fit for us? There\r\nis an opposite extreme to high cultivation; there are evils besetting\r\nlow-cultivation. In cold, wet, stiff, barren soils, and in a cool, or\r\nhumid, or cloudy atmosphere, trees require stimulants. The soil needs\r\ndrying, warming, manuring; and the tree requires pruning. But such a\r\nsystem is ruinous, where the soil is full of fiery activity, bursting\r\nout with an irrepressible fertility and a superabundant vegetation;\r\nwhere the long summer days are intensely brilliant, and the _air_ warm\r\nenough to ripen fruit even in the densest shade of an unpruned tree.\r\n\r\nA traveller in Lapland would require the most bracing and stimulating\r\nfood; but in New Orleans it would produce fever and death. A region,\r\nsubject to all the diseases and evils of vegetable plethora, has\r\nadopted the practice of regions subject to the opposite evils. While\r\nreceiving with gratitude, at the hands of eminent foreign\r\nphysiologists and cultivators, the _principles_, we must establish the\r\nART of horticulture, by a practice conformable to our own\r\ncircumstances. A treatment which in England would only produce\r\nhealthful growth, in this country would pamper a tree to a luxurious\r\nfullness. Let us not be deluded by the fallacious appearance of our\r\norchards. The evils which we have to fear are not shown forth in the\r\nearly history of a tree or an orchard. On the contrary, the appearance\r\nwill be flattering. The apple is a more hardy tree than the pear, and\r\nwill endure greater mismanagement; but in the long run we shall have\r\nto pay for our greedy cultivation, even in the apple family. Our\r\npear-trees are already evincing the evils of a too luxuriant habit;\r\nand if the West is ever to become the pear-region of America, the\r\nculture of this tree must be adapted to the peculiarities of western\r\nsoil and climate.\r\n\r\nIt will be borne in mind that our remarks upon the cultivation of\r\nfruit-trees are not applicable to the processes of art employed in\r\nexperimental gardens, or in climates requiring a highly artificial\r\nculture, but to gardens and open orchards of the pear and apple in the\r\nmiddle and Western States.\r\n\r\n_Our climate and soil predispose fruit-trees to excessive growth._\r\nThere is, in the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and in the thickly\r\nsettled portions of Missouri and Kentucky, very little poor soil.\r\nLimestone lands, clay lands, sandy barns and alluvions, afford not\r\nonly variety of soil, but the strongest and most fertile. The forest\r\ntrees of the West compared with the same species east of the Alleghany\r\nridge, exhibit the difference of soils. Artificial processes may\r\nproduce better soils, it may be, but there is not probably on earth so\r\nlarge a body of land which is, as uniformly, deep, strong, quick, and\r\nrich in all mineral and vegetable substances. It is cultivated under a\r\nclimate most congenial to vegetation, both in respect to length and\r\ntemperature. Our spring is early. In 1835 we gathered flowers from the\r\nwoods, near Cincinnati, on the 22d of February. In 1839 we gathered\r\nthem at Lawrenceburgh, in the last week of February. We find in our\r\ngarden journal at Indianapolis, latitude 39°55′ north, March 11, 1840,\r\n“rose-bushes, honey-suckles, and willow trees had been in leaf for\r\nsome days,” and seed-sowing had begun. In 1841, seed was sown in open\r\nground, April 8th. In 1842, pie-plant broke ground March 8th, and all\r\nearly seed were in the ground by the 21st. In 1843, seeds were in by\r\nApril 20. In 1844 ground was in a working state Feb. 23d, and seeds\r\nput in by March 1. Trees, varying according to the nature of the\r\nseason, complete the _first_ growth, on an average, about the 1st of\r\nSeptember. Their second growth continues, usually, into November. In\r\n1844 we had noisette roses pushing out terminal leaves after\r\n_Christmas_; but this is not a frequent occurrence. Upon an average,\r\nthe middle of March and the 1st of November, may be taken as the\r\nlimits of the vegetable year—a period of more than seven months.\r\nDuring this season rains are copious, and frequent. Our midsummer\r\ndroughts are seldom so severe upon vegetation as they seem to be in\r\nNew England. During the months of June, July and August, the\r\ntemperature of mid-day seldom falls below 70° Fahren. and ranges\r\nbetween 70° and 100°.\r\n\r\nOne other cause of rapid growth is to be mentioned—the nature of our\r\nwinters. Except when the roots are frozen, they are supposed never to\r\nbe inactive. During the winter they slowly absorb materials from the\r\nsoil, and fill the whole system with sap. When the winters are severe,\r\nthey are usually very long; and the slowness of its winter action is\r\ncompensated by the length of time afforded to the plant. In the\r\nwestern States, though the winters are short, yet there is scarcely a\r\nweek in which trees may not accumulate their stores. The spring growth\r\nwill be vigorous in proportion to the amount of true sap collected in\r\nthe vegetable system. As the whole winter is mild enough for this\r\nprocess to go on, the growth of trees is rampant in spring. Thus, the\r\nquality of the soils, and the nature of the seasons—the mildness of\r\nwinter—the earliness of spring and length of summer—its heat and great\r\natmospheric brilliancy, all conspire to produce very rapid and strong\r\ngrowth in herb, shrub, and tree; and I repeat, as a fundamental\r\nconsideration, that our SOIL AND SEASON PREDISPOSE FRUIT-TREES TO\r\nEXCESSIVE GROWTH. From this fact we should take our start in every\r\nprocess of orchard, nursery, and garden cultivation of fruit-trees;\r\nand if philosophically employed it will, we will not say\r\nrevolutionize, but materially modify the processes of cultivation\r\npeculiar to colder climates and poorer soils. In respect to esculent\r\nvegetables—cabbages, radishes, celery, rhubarb, lettuce, etc., this\r\nrank and rapid growth is beneficial, since it is not the _fruit_ but\r\nthe _plant_ which we eat. The reverse is true in fruit-trees.\r\nObservant cultivators have conformed to this indication of nature, in\r\nsome things; for instance, in the treatment of the grape. The German\r\nemigrants who settled in these parts, having been conversant with\r\nvine-dressing in Europe, were usually employed to cut and lay in the\r\nvines of such as were desirous of the best gardens. But, gradually,\r\ntheir practice has been rejected, and now, instead of reducing our\r\nvines to niggardly stumps, the wood is spared and laid in long. If\r\npruning be close, the vine may be said to overflow with excess of new\r\nwood, which does not ripen well. Our remarks more especially apply to\r\nregions below 40° of north latitude.\r\n\r\nBelow this line, our efforts need not be directed to the forcing of\r\ngrowth, for that, naturally, will be all-sufficient. Our object must\r\nbe _compact and thoroughly ripened wood_. These reasonings may be\r\napplied to many practices now generally in vogue.\r\n\r\n1. It is the practice of nurserymen to force their trees by\r\ncultivation, and by pruning. It is very well known, to those\r\nconversant with the nursery business, that great growers and early\r\ngrowers are the favorites (and, so far as an expeditious preparation\r\nof stock for sale is concerned, justly), that slow and tedious growers\r\nare put upon rampant growing stocks to quicken them. In some cases\r\nmanures are freely applied to the soil, as directed by all writers who\r\nteach how to prepare ground for a nursery. But such writers had their\r\neye upon the soil of England or New England. The still more vicious\r\npractice of side trimming and free pruning is followed, which forces\r\nthe tree to produce a great deal of wood, rather than to ripen well a\r\nlittle. A well-informed nurseryman ought not to look so much at the\r\n_length_ of his trees, as to the _quality of their wood_. The very\r\nbeau ideal of a fruit-tree for our climate is one that, while it is\r\nhardy enough to grow steadily in cool seasons, is not excitable enough\r\nto grow rampantly in warm ones, and which completes its work early in\r\nthe season, ripens its wood thoroughly, and goes to rest before there\r\nis danger of severe frost. Such trees may be had, by skillful\r\nbreeding, as easily, as, by breeding, any desirable quality may be\r\ndeveloped in cattle or horses. But of this hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe subject of pruning will be separately treated; but it is\r\nappropriate here to say, that every consideration should incline the\r\nnurseryman to grow his trees _with side brush from top to bottom_, and\r\nby shortening these, to multiply leaves to the greatest possible\r\nextent all over the tree. In every climate we should idolize the\r\n_leaf_—in which are the sources of health and abiding vigor.\r\n\r\n2. The mistakes of the nursery are carried out and developed by the\r\npurchaser, in the following respects—by bad selection, pernicious\r\ncultivation, and by improper pruning.\r\n\r\nFirst, trees are selected upon a bad principle. Men are very naturally\r\nin a hurry to see their orchards in bearing; precocious trees,\r\ntherefore, and all means of prematurity are sought. In respect to the\r\npear, it is the popular, but incorrect, opinion that it takes a man’s\r\nlifetime to bring them into fruit. Hope deferred, very naturally in\r\nsuch cases, makes the heart sick. But certain talismanic words found\r\nin catalogues and fruit manuals restore the courage, and you shall\r\nfind the pencil mark made upon all pears, described as “of a vigorous\r\ngrowth,” “a rampant grower,” “comes early into bearing,” “bears\r\nyoung,” “a great and early bearer.” But such as these—“not of a very\r\nvigorous growth,” “does not bear young,” “the growth is slow but\r\nhealthy,” “grows to a large size before producing fruit,”—are passed\r\nby. Many farmers judge of a tree as they would timothy grass. A\r\nshort-jointed, compact branch, is “_stunted_;” but a long, plump limb,\r\nlike a water shoot, or a Lombardy poplar branch, is admired as a\r\nfirst-rate growth. Some pears have but this single virtue: they make\r\nwood in capital quantities, but very poor pears. Now our selection\r\nmust proceed on different principles if our orchards are to be\r\n_durable_ and _healthy_. We should mark for selection pears described\r\nas—“of a compact habit,” “growth slow and healthy,” “ripens its wood\r\nearly and thoroughly.” A tree which runs far into the fall, and makes\r\nquantities of wood more than it can thoroughly ripen, must be regarded\r\nas unsafe and undesirable.\r\n\r\nThere is another marked fault in selecting trees—a disposition to get\r\nlong and handsome trees with smooth stems. This principle of selection\r\nwould be excellent when one goes after a bean-pole, or a cane. A\r\nfruit-tree is not usually cultivated for such uses. In the first\r\nplace, it is not wise to expose the trunk of a fruit-tree to the full\r\nsun of our summers. We have seen peach trees killed by opening the\r\nhead so much as to expose the main branches to the sun. A low head, a\r\nshort trunk should be sought. When land is scarce, and orchards\r\ncultivated, high trimming is employed for the sake of convenience, not\r\nof the tree, but of its _owner_. And in cool and humid climates, such\r\nevils do not attend the practice, as with us. Beside picking long\r\nshanked trees, one would suppose that a leaf below the crotch would\r\npoison the tree from the assiduity with which they are trimmed off. It\r\nought to be laid down as a fundamental rule with us, that a tree is\r\nbenefited _not by the amount of its wood, but by the extent of its\r\nleaf surface_. Every effort should be used to make the length of the\r\nwood moderate, and the amount of its leaves abundant. The leaf does\r\nnot depend for its quality on the wood, _but the wood takes its nature\r\nfrom the leaf_. Young trees ought to be grown with side brush from the\r\nroots to the fork. Water shoots from the root are to be removed, but\r\nleaves upon the trunk are to be nursed. By cutting in the brush when\r\nit tends to a long growth, it will emit side shoots, and still\r\nincrease the number of leaves.\r\n\r\nSecondly. There is great evil in pruning too much. France and England\r\nhave given us our notions upon pruning. There, their own system is\r\nwise, because it conforms to the climate and soil. But their system of\r\npruning is totally uncongenial with our seasons and the habits of our\r\ntrees. In England, for instance, the peach will not ripen in open\r\ngrounds, except, perhaps, in the extreme southern counties. In\r\nconsequence, it is trained upon walls, and its wood thinned, to let\r\nlight and heat upon every part of it. It is very right to husband\r\nlight and heat when it is scarce, and by opening the head of a tree to\r\ncarry them to all parts of the sluggish wood. But we often have more\r\nthan we want. A peach will ripen, on the lowest limb and inside of the\r\ntree, by the mere heat of the atmosphere. Even in New England, the\r\nEnglish system of pruning proves too free. Manning says, “From the\r\nstrong growth of fruit-trees in our country and the dryness of its\r\natmosphere, severe pruning is less necessary here than in England.” We\r\nare not giving rules _for_ pruning; but cautions _against_ pruning too\r\nfreely. There is not a single point in fruit cultivation where more\r\nmistakes are committed than in _pruning_.\r\n\r\nThirdly. Great mistakes are committed in stimulating the growth of\r\ntrees by enriching the soil. Books direct (and men naturally and\r\ninnocently obey), the putting of manure to young trees. We have no\r\ndoubt that the time will come, when manures will be so thoroughly\r\nanalyzed and classified, that we can employ them just as a carpenter\r\ndoes his tools, or the farmer his implements; if we wish _wood_, we\r\nshall apply certain ingredients to the soil and have it; if we wish\r\nfruit, we shall have at hand manures which promote the fruiting\r\nproperties of the tree; if we want seed, we shall have manures for it.\r\nBut manures as now employed, are, usually, not beneficial to orchards\r\nof _young_ trees. A clay soil, very stiff and adhesive, may require\r\nsand and vegetable mold to render it permeable to the root; some very\r\nbarren soils may require some manure; but the average of our farms are\r\nrich enough already, and too rich for the good of the young tree. It\r\nwould be better for the orchard if it made less wood and made it\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nIf these directions make the prospect of fruit so distant as to\r\ndiscourage the planting of orchards, we will add, plant your orchard;\r\nand if you cannot wait for its healthful growth, plant also trees for\r\nimmediate use, and serve them just as you please; manure them, cut\r\nthem, get fruit at all hazards; only make up your minds that they will\r\nbe short-lived and liable to blight and disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [12] For the young reader it may be necessary to say, that\r\n     when sap is first taken up by the roots it is called _true\r\n     sap_; but after it has undergone a change in the leaves it\r\n     is called _proper juice_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIST OF CHOICE FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur readers may desire a list of fruits, which are universally\r\nadmitted to be of first-rate excellence.

Or rather, we see\r\nnew adventurers in this line, for the failure of many and the\r\nabandonment of the business, prevents the number from becoming so\r\ngreat as one would suppose.\r\n\r\nWe are very glad to see the art of fruit culture increasing, and we\r\nare very glad to see competent men embarking in the nursery business.\r\nBut we are sorry to see the impression gaining ground that it is a\r\nbusiness which anybody can conduct, and that every man can make money\r\nby it who knows how to graft or to bud. Let no man embark in it under\r\nsuch misapprehension.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the time, and labor, and patience required for a\r\nsuccessful nursery business is much greater than any one suspects\r\nbeforehand. If a man has a large capital he may begin sales at once\r\nupon a purchased stock. But if one is to prepare his own stock for\r\nmarket, and this must be the case with by far the greater number of\r\nwestern nurserymen, it will require several years of expensive labor\r\nbefore he can realize anything. Nor even then will he be apt to\r\nreceive profits which will at all meet his expectations. During these\r\nyears of preparation on what is he to live? If he has means, very\r\nwell; but let no man suppose that he can get along, especially with a\r\nfamily on his hands, during the early years of his nursery, if he has\r\nnothing else to depend upon. The mere physical labor of keeping a\r\nnursery in proper order is such as to make it no sinecure.\r\n\r\nBut all this is a less consideration than the special skill and\r\nvigilant care required to conduct a nursery in an honorable manner.\r\nNowhere do mistakes occur more easily, and nowhere are they more\r\nprovoking, both to the buyer and seller. It is rare that assistants\r\ncan be had upon whom reliance can be placed. There are men enough to\r\nplow, and grub, and clean; but to select buds and grafts, to work the\r\nvarious kinds, and plant them safely by themselves, this, usually,\r\nmust be done by the proprietor. Where a nursery is carried on by\r\nassistants, it makes almost no difference how much care is used,\r\nmistakes will abound.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which an error goes is not unworthy of a moment’s\r\nattention. We purchased of a very highly respectable nurseryman, the\r\n_Royal George_ peach. The first season many buds were distributed from\r\nit. An expert nurseryman in the vicinity, among others, got of it. The\r\ncredit of the original proprietor of the tree was such that it was\r\nthought safe to propagate at once, and thousands of trees were worked\r\nwith these buds; from him, nurserymen from neighboring counties\r\nprocured scions, and now the Royal George, which has proved to be no\r\nRoyal George at all, is scattered all over the country. When a nursery\r\ncontains from fifty to a hundred kinds of apples, thirty or forty\r\nkinds of pears, ten to twenty sorts of cherries, thirty or forty kinds\r\nof peaches, besides plums, nectarines, apricots, etc., there will be\r\nsome two or three hundred _separate varieties_ of fruit to be\r\npropagated each year, and of each sort from a hundred to a thousand or\r\nmore trees, according to the business of the nursery. Two things are\r\napparent from this view; first, that such unremitting and sagacious\r\nvigilance is required that not every one is fit to be a nurseryman;\r\nand, secondly, that not every nurseryman is a scamp who puts upon you\r\ntrees untrue to their names. No doubt there are roguish nurserymen; no\r\ndoubt, too, there are culpably careless men in this, as in all other\r\nforms of business. But no one will be so charitable to nurserymen as\r\nthose who understand the difficulties of their business; and a\r\nmistake, and many of them, may occur in well-appointed grounds, which\r\nno care could well have prevented.\r\n\r\nWe think this to be a business to which no man should turn, except\r\nunder two conditions; first, that he will, if he has not already,\r\nserve a faithful apprenticeship to it—we do not mean by regular\r\nindenture, but by practising for several years in a good nursery until\r\nthe prominent essential parts of the business have become practically\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nThe other condition is, that he make up his mind to _see to it\r\nhimself_.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nREMEDY FOR YELLOW BUGS.—A gentleman informs us that he has always\r\nsaved his vines by planting _poppies_ among them. Those on one side of\r\nan alley, without poppies, would be entirely eaten, while those on the\r\nother side, with poppies, would not be touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BREEDING OF FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause, as yet, no certain rules can be laid down for the production\r\nof a given result by crossing flower on flower, it does not follow\r\nthat there are not certain invariable principles which govern the\r\nprocess. It is but a little while since breeding animals had any\r\npretension to scientific rules. But, by careful practice and\r\nobservation, the most important improvement has been attained in all\r\nthe animals belonging to the farm. And if careful research and\r\nexperiment do not result in absolute certainty, they will yet render\r\nthe production of fine varieties of fruit, by the crossing of the old\r\nones, a matter of much less chance than it now is.\r\n\r\nThe art of cross-fertilization is being much more practised by\r\nflorists than by pomologists, and for obvious reasons. What the\r\nbreeder of annuals can do in a few months requires more than as many\r\nyears from him that essays to raise new fruits. Many florists’\r\nflowers, however, require as long and even a longer time than apples\r\nor pears; and it is a marvel that the phlegmatic patience of the\r\ntulip-loving Dutch Jobs should not have found imitators in the\r\norchard. If a man can wait ten years to ascertain that all his\r\nseedling bulbs are good for nothing, or at the best, that out of ten\r\nthousand, but one or two are worth keeping, surely the patience of an\r\nenthusiast in fruit ought not to snap by being drawn through such a\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nTwo methods for originating new varieties of fruit have been\r\npractised; the _natural_ method of Van Mons, and the _artificial_\r\nmethod of Knight. Van Mons, born at Brussels in 1765, was a man of\r\nfine genius and thorough education. Although he is chiefly known as a\r\npomologist, his labors in the nursery were only incidental to the\r\nregular occupation of a public scientific life. M. Poiteau quaintly\r\nsays of him that he writes “on the gravest subjects, in the midst of\r\nnoise, in a company of persons who talk loudly on frivolous subjects,\r\nand takes part in the conversation without stopping his pen.”\r\n\r\nVan Mons’ theory is founded upon two physical facts:\r\n\r\n1. _That all seeds in a state of nature can be made by cultivation to\r\nvary from their condition, which variations may be fixed, and become\r\npermanent._\r\n\r\n2. _That all cultivated seeds have a tendency to return toward that\r\nnatural state from which they originally varied._ We say _toward_, for\r\nhe supposed that an improved fruit would never return absolutely to\r\nthe original and natural type.\r\n\r\nIt was upon this last principle that Van Mons accounted for the fact,\r\nthat as a general thing, the seeds of fine old varieties of fruit\r\nproduced only inferior kinds. Recourse could not be had therefore to\r\nseeds of improved fruit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the seed of fruits absolutely wild would produce\r\nfruits exactly like their original. If the seed of the wild pear be\r\ngotten from the wood and planted in a garden, every seed will yield\r\nonly the wild pear again. But if a wild pear be transplanted, and put\r\nunder new influences of soil, climate and cultivation, its fruit will\r\nbegin to augment and improve. The change is not merely upon the size\r\nand appearance of the fruit, it affects also the qualities of the\r\n_seed_. For if the seed be now planted, the difference between a wild\r\npear, _in a state of nature_ and the same wild pear-tree _in a state\r\nof cultivation_ will at once appear in this, that whereas the seed of\r\nthe first is _constant_, the seed of the second shows an inclination\r\nto _vary_. Here then is a starting. When once the habit of _variation_\r\nis gained, the foundation of improvement is laid. In a short time the\r\nenthusiasm of Van Mons had collected into his garden 80,000 trees upon\r\nwhich he was experimenting, nor can the result of his labors be better\r\nstated than in the words of M. Poiteau:\r\n\r\n     “That so long as plants remain in their natural situation,\r\n     they do not sensibly vary, and their seeds always produce\r\n     the same; but on changing their climate and territory\r\n     several among them vary, some more and others less, and when\r\n     they have once departed from their natural state, they never\r\n     again return to it, but are removed more and more therefrom,\r\n     by successive generations, and produce, sufficiently often,\r\n     distinct races, more or less durable, and that finally if\r\n     these variations are even carried back to the territory of\r\n     their ancestors, they will neither represent the character\r\n     of their parents, or ever return to the species from whence\r\n     they sprung.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Van Mons began to sow the seeds of natural and wild fruit\r\nwhich were in a _variable_ state. By all means within his power he\r\nhastened his seedlings to show fruit. The first generation showed only\r\npoor fruit but decidedly better than the wild. Selecting the seed of\r\nthe best of these, he sowed again. From the fruit of these he sowed\r\nthe third generation. From the third, a fourth; and from the fourth, a\r\nfifth; as far as the eighth generation.\r\n\r\nHis experience showed that there was great difference among different\r\nspecies of fruit in the number of generations through which they must\r\npass before they were perfect. The apple yielded good fruit in the\r\nfourth generation. Stone fruits produced perfect kinds in the third\r\ngeneration. Some varieties afforded perfect fruit in the fifth\r\ngeneration, while others go on improving to the eighth.\r\n\r\nThe time required for this renovation diminished at each remove from\r\nthe normal or wild state. Thus, the trees from the second sowing of\r\nthe pear-seed fruited in from ten to twelve years; those from their\r\nseed, or of the third genetion in from eight to ten years; those of\r\nthe fourth generation in from six to eight years; those of the fifth\r\ngeneration, in six years, and those in the eight, in four years. These\r\nare the _mean_ terms of all his experiments.\r\n\r\nTo obtain perfect stone fruits, through four successive generations,\r\nfrom parent to son, required from twelve to fifteen years; the apple\r\nrequired twenty years, and the pear, when carried only to the fifth\r\ngeneration, required from thirty to thirty-six years.\r\n\r\nHYBRIDIZATION, OR KNIGHT’S METHOD.—Andrew Knight, one of the most\r\noriginal and philosophic horticulturists that ever lived, pursued an\r\nentirely different method—that of _cross-fertilization_. He carefully\r\nremoved the anthers from the blossoms upon which he wished to operate,\r\nso that the stigma should not receive a particle of the pollen\r\nbelonging to its own flower. He then procured from the variety which\r\nhe wished to cross, a portion of the pollen, and artificially\r\nimpregnated the prepared blossom with it. When the fruit thus produced\r\nhad ripened its seeds, they were sown, and by regular process brought\r\ninto bearing. The progeny were found to combine, in various degrees of\r\nexcellence, the qualities of both parents.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THE TWO METHODS.\r\n\r\n1. Both Van Mons and Knight believed in a degeneracy of plants; but\r\nthe degeneracy of the one system is not to be confounded with that of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nKnight believed that varieties had a regular period of existence;\r\nalthough, as in animal life, care and skill might make essential\r\ndifference in the longevity, yet they could in nowise avert the final\r\ncatastrophe; a time would come, sooner or later, at which the\r\nvegetable vitality would be expended, and the variety must perish by\r\nexhaustion—by _running out_.\r\n\r\nVan Mons believed that an improved variety tended to return to its\r\nnormal state—to its wild type; and although he did not believe that it\r\ncould ever be entirely restored to its wild state, it might go so far\r\nas to make it worthless for useful purposes.\r\n\r\nKnight believed in absolute decay; Van Mons, in retrocession.\r\nAccording to Knight’s theory, varieties of fruit cease by the natural\r\nstatute of limitation; according to Van Mons, they only fall from\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nThere can be no reasonable doubt that Van Mons held the truth, and as\r\nlittle, that Knight’s speculations were fallacious. Bad cultivation\r\nwill cause anything to run out; no plant will perfect its tissues or\r\nfruit without the soil affords it elementary materials. The so-called\r\nexhausted varieties renew their youth when transplanted into soils\r\nsuitable for them.\r\n\r\n2. Against Van Mons’ method it is urged, that it enfeebles the\r\nconstitution of plants; that, _enfeebling_ is the very key of the\r\nprocess. This Mr. Downing urges with emphasis, saying that, “the\r\nBelgian method (Van Mons’) gives us varieties often impaired in their\r\n_health_ in their very origin.” It is one thing to restrain the energy\r\nof a plant, and another to enfeeble it. It may be enfeebled until it\r\nbecomes unhealthy, but rampant vigor is as really an unhealthy state\r\nas the other extreme. A tree refuses fruit and is liable to death from\r\na coarse, open, rank growth, as much as from a languor which\r\nsuppresses all growth.\r\n\r\nNo; that which we imagine Van Mons to have effected was a smaller, but\r\nmore _compact_ and _fine_ growth. Nor are we aware that, _as a matter\r\nof experience_, the Belgian pears prove to be any more tender than the\r\nEnglish. Doubtless, there are trees of a delicate and tender habit in\r\nthe number, but as few, in proportion to the great number originated,\r\nas by any other method.\r\n\r\nThe two main objections to the plan are the _time required_, and the\r\nutter _uncertainty of the results_. To imitate the process would\r\nrequire a Van Mons’ patience, in which, probably, he was never\r\nsurpassed, and his enthusiasm, which was extraordinary even for a\r\nhorticulturist, a race of beings supposed to be anything but\r\nphlegmatic.\r\n\r\nThe _uncertainty_ is such as to prevent any determinate improvement.\r\nWe get, not what we may wish, but whatever may happen to come. Nothing\r\nthat art can do would affect the size, color, hardness, or in any\r\nrespect, the general character of the fruit.\r\n\r\nIt is in these aspects that Knight’s method must always be preferred\r\nas a practical system. We can obtain a return for our labor in\r\n_one-fifth_ the time; and, what is even more important, we can\r\nregulate, before-hand, the results within certain limits. The new\r\nfruit is to be made up of the qualities of its parents in various\r\nproportions. We cannot determine what the proportions shall be, but we\r\ncan determine what parents shall be selected. Nor is it at all\r\nimprobable that, when knowledge has become more exact by a longer and\r\nlarger experience, the breeder of fruit may cross the varieties with\r\nnearly the same certainty of result as does the breeder of stock. It\r\nis upon this feature, the power which science has over the results to\r\nbe obtained, that we look with the greatest interest; and we urge upon\r\nscientific cultivators the duty of perfecting our fruits by judicious\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING ORCHARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe habit of early spring pruning has been handed down to us from\r\nEnglish customs, and farmers do it because it always has been done.\r\nBesides, about this time, men have leisure, and would like to begin\r\nthe season’s work; and pruning seems quite a natural employment with\r\nwhich to introduce the labors of the year.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for America, but more emphatically for western\r\ncultivators to do worse than to pattern upon the example of British\r\nand Continental authorities in the matter of orchards and vineyards.\r\nThe summers of England are moist, cool, and deficient in light. Our\r\nsummers are exactly the reverse—dry, fervid, and brilliant. The\r\nstimuli of the elements with them are much below, and with us much\r\nabove par. In consequence, their trees have but a moderate growth;\r\nours are inclined to excessive growth.\r\n\r\nTheir whole system of open-culture, and wall-training is founded upon\r\nthe necessity of _husbanding all their resources_. To avail themselves\r\nof every particle of light, they keep open the heads of their trees,\r\nso that the parsimonious sunshine shall penetrate every part of the\r\ntree. Let this be done with us, and there are many of our trees that\r\nwould be killed by the force of the sun’s rays upon the naked branches\r\nin a single season, or very much enfeebled. For the same general\r\nreasons, the English reduce the quantity of bearing-wood, shortening a\r\npart or wholly cutting it out, that the residue, having the whole\r\nenergy of the tree concentrated upon it, may perfect its fruit. Our\r\ndifficulty being an excess of vitality, this system of shortening and\r\ncutting out, would cause the tree to send out suckers from the root\r\nand trunk, and would fill the head of the tree with rank water-shoots\r\nor _gourmands_. What would be thought of the people of the torrid zone\r\nshould they borrow their customs of clothing from the practice of\r\nGreenland? It would be as rational as it is for orchardists, in a land\r\nwhose summers are long and of high temperature, to copy the customs of\r\na land whose summers are prodigal of fog and rain, but penurious of\r\nheat and light.\r\n\r\nExcept to remove dead, diseased or interfering branches, do not cut at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBut if pruning is to be done, wait till after corn-planting. _The best\r\ntime to prune is the time when healing will the quickest follow\r\ncutting._ This is not in early spring, but in early summer. The\r\nelements from which new wood is produced are not drawn from the rising\r\nsap, but from that which descends between the bark and wood. This sap,\r\ncalled _true sap_, is the upward sap after it has gone through that\r\nchemical laboratory, the leaf. Each leaf is a chemical contractor,\r\ndoing up its part of the work of preparing sap for use, as fast as it\r\nis sent up to it from the root through the interior sap-passages. In\r\nthe leaf, the sap gives off and receives, certain properties; and when\r\nthus elaborated, it is charged with all those elements required for\r\nthe formation and sustentation of every part of vegetable fabric.\r\nDescending, it gives out its various qualities, till it reaches the\r\nroot; and whatever is left then passes out into the soil.\r\n\r\nEvery man will perceive that if a tree is pruned in spring before it\r\nhas a leaf out, there is no sap provided to repair the wound. A slight\r\ngranulation _may_ take place, in certain circumstances, and in some\r\nkinds of plants, from the elements with which the tree was stored\r\nduring the former season; but, in point of fact, a cut usually remains\r\nwithout change until, the progress of spring puts the whole vegetable\r\neconomy into action.\r\n\r\nIn young and vigorous trees, this process may not seem to occasion any\r\ninjury. But trees growing feeble by age will soon manifest the result\r\nof this injudicious practice, by blackened stumps, by cankered sores,\r\nand by decay.\r\n\r\nIf one must begin to do something that looks like spring-work, let him\r\ngo at a more efficient train of operations. With a good spade invert\r\nthe sod for several feet from the body of the tree. With a good\r\nscraper remove all dead bark. Dilute (old) soft soap with urine; take\r\na stiff shoe-brush, and go to scouring the trunk and main branches.\r\nThis will be labor to some purpose; and before you have gone through a\r\nlarge orchard faithfully, your zeal for spring-work will have become\r\nso far tempered with knowledge, that you will be willing to _let\r\npruning alone till after corn-planting_.\r\n\r\nTwo exceptions or precautions should be mentioned.\r\n\r\n1. In the use of the wash; new soap is more _caustic_ than old; and\r\nthe sediments of a soap barrel much more so than the mass of soap.\r\nSometimes trees have been injured by applying a caustic alkali in too\r\ngreat strength. There is little danger of this when a tree is rough\r\nand covered with dead bark or dirt; but when it is smooth and has no\r\nscurf it is more liable to suffer. _Trees should not be washed in dry\r\nand warm weather._ The best time is just before spring rains, or\r\nbefore any rain.\r\n\r\n2. Where fruit-trees are found to have suffered from the winter,\r\npruning cannot be too early, and hardly too severe. If left to grow,\r\nthe heat of spring days ferments the sap and spreads blight throughout\r\nthe tree; whereas, by severe cutting, there is a chance, at least, of\r\nremoving much of the injured wood. We have gone over the pear-trees in\r\nour own garden, and wherever the least affection has been discovered,\r\nwe have cut out every particle of the last summer’s wood; and cut back\r\nuntil we reached sound and healthy wood, pith and bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLITTING THE BARK OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a practice very much followed by fruit-raisers. Downing gives\r\nhis sanction to it. Mr. Pell (N. Y.), famous for his orchards,\r\nincludes it as a part of his system of orchard cultivation. Men talk\r\nof trees being _bark-bound_, etc., and let out the bark on the same\r\nprinciple, we suppose, as mothers do the pantaloons of growing boys.\r\nWe confess a prejudice against this letting out of the tucks in a\r\ntree’s clothes. We do not say that there may not be cases of diseased\r\ntrees in which, as a remedial process, this may be wise; but we should\r\nas soon think of slitting the skin on a boy’s legs, or on a calf’s or\r\ncolt’s, as a regular part of a plan of rearing them, as to slash the\r\nbark of sound and healthy trees. _Bark-bound!_ what is that? Does the\r\ninside of a tree grow faster than the outside? When bark is slit, is\r\nit looser around the whole trunk than before? When granulations have\r\nfilled up this artificial channel, is not the bark just as tight as it\r\nwas before? Mark, we do not say that it is _not_ a good practice; but\r\nonly that we do not yet understand _what_ the benefit is.\r\n\r\n“Why, the bark bursts sometimes.”\r\n\r\nYes, disease may thus affect it; and when it does, _cut if necessary_.\r\n\r\n“Does it do any harm?” Perhaps not; neither would it to put a\r\nweathercock on the top of every tree; or to bury a black cat under the\r\nroots, or to mark each tree with talismanic signs. Is it worth while\r\nto do a thing just because it does no harm?\r\n\r\n“But when a tree is growing too fast, does it not need it?” Yes, if it\r\ncan be shown that the bark, alburnum, etc., do not increase alike.\r\nThat excitement which increases the growth of one part of a tree will,\r\nas a general fact, increase the growth of every other. In respect to\r\nthe _fruit and seed_, doubtless, particular manures will develop\r\nspecial properties. But is there evidence that such a thing takes\r\nplace in respect to the various tissues of the wood, bark, etc?\r\n\r\n“But if a tree be sluggish, and bound, will it not help it?” Whatever\r\nexcites a more vigorous circulation will be of advantage. Whether any\r\nsupposed advantage from the knife arises in this way, we do not know.\r\nBut a good _scraping_, or a scouring off of the whole body with sand,\r\nand then a pungent alkaline wash—(soft soap diluted with urine) would,\r\nwe think, be better for bark-bound trees than the whole tribe of\r\nslits, vertical, horizontal, zig-zag, or waved.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nHOVEY’S MAGAZINE OF HORTICULTURE.—We recommend all who can afford\r\nthree dollars a year for a sterling monthly, beautifully got up, in\r\nthe best style of Boston typography, to send to Boston for Hovey’s\r\nMagazine. We give it an unqualified recommendation, and those who take\r\nit one year will be loth to part with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWNING’s FRUIT AND FRUIT-TREES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a book is hopelessly weak or incorrect, it should be the object\r\nof criticism to exterminate it. But when a work is admitted to be,\r\nupon the whole, well done, criticism ought to be an assistance to it,\r\nand not a hindrance. Praise by the wholesale is better for the\r\npublisher than for the reputation of the author; since, in a work like\r\nDowning’s, every pomologist knows that perfection is not attainable,\r\nand indiscriminate eulogy inclines the better-read critic to rebut the\r\npraise by a full development of the faults. Thus on one side there as\r\ngeneral praise and faint blame; and on the other, faint praise and\r\ngeneral blame.\r\n\r\nWe shall, at present, confine our attention to the catalogue of apples\r\nand pears, for all other fruits of our zone together are not of\r\nimportance equal to these; and if an author excels in respect to\r\nthese, his success will cover a multitude of sins in the treatment of\r\nsmall fruits, and fruits of short duration. Mr. Downing has shown good\r\njudgment in making out his list of varieties; his descriptions, for\r\nthe most part, seem to be from his own senses; he has added many\r\ninteresting particulars in respect to fruits not recorded before, or\r\nelse scattered in isolated sentences in magazines and journals.\r\n\r\nBut are his descriptions thorough and uniform? While he has added\r\n_materials_ to pomology, has he advanced the _science_ by reducing\r\nsuch materials to a consistent form? If we compare Mr. Downing’s\r\ndescriptions with those of Kenrick, or even of Manning, he excels them\r\nin fullness. If he be compared with classic European pomologists, he\r\nis decidedly inferior, both in the conception of what was to be done,\r\nand in a neat, systematic method of execution. Indeed, Mr. Downing\r\ndoes not seem to have settled, beforehand, in his mind, a _formula_ of\r\na description; sometimes only three or four characteristics are given.\r\nDowning sins in excellent company. There is not an American\r\npomological writer who appears to have _conceived_, even, of a\r\nsystematic, scientific description of fruits. European authors,\r\ndecidedly more explicit and minute than we are, have never reduced the\r\ndescriptive part of the science to anything like regularity. We do not\r\nsuppose that there can be such exact and constant dissimilarities\r\ndetected between variety and variety of a species, as exists between\r\nspecies and species of a genus. We do not think a description of\r\nfruits to be imperfect, therefore, merely because it is less\r\ndistinctive than a description of plants. But the more variable and\r\nobscure the points of difference between two varieties, the more\r\nscrupulously careful must we be to seize them. Where differences are\r\nbroad and uniform, science can afford to be careless, but not where\r\nthey are vague and illusory. We can approximate a systematic accuracy.\r\nBut it must be by making up in the _number_ of determining\r\ncircumstances, that which is wanting in the invariable distinctiveness\r\nof a few that are _specific_.\r\n\r\n1. Downing’s descriptions are quite _irregular_ and _unequal_. Both\r\nhis pears and apples are imperfect, but not alike imperfect. The\r\ndescriptions of pears are decidedly in advance of those of the apple.\r\nIt would seem as if the improvement which he gained by practice was\r\nvery easily traced in its course on his pages.\r\n\r\nHardly two apples are described in reference to the same particulars.\r\nWith respect to color of skin, size and form, eye and stem, he\r\napproaches the nearest to uniformity. But with respect to every other\r\nfeature there is an utter want of regularity, which indicates not so\r\nmuch _carelessness_ as the want of any settled plan or conception of a\r\nperfect scientific description.\r\n\r\nWe will, out of a multitude of similar cases, select a few as\r\nspecimens of what we mean. Of the _Pumpkin Russet_, he says, “flesh\r\nexceedingly rich and sweet;” but he does not speak of its _texture_,\r\nwhether coarse or fine; whether brittle or leathery. _Pomme de\r\nNeige_—“flesh remarkably white, very tender, juicy and good, with a\r\nslight perfume;” but is it sweet or sour, or subacid, or astringent?\r\nNo one can tell by reading the joint descriptions of the _Red_ and the\r\n_Yellow Ingestries_ what their flavor is, since it is only said that\r\nthey are “juicy and high flavored”—but whether the high flavored juice\r\nis sweet or sour, does not appear. These are not picked instances.\r\nThey occur on almost every page of his list of apples. The _Summer\r\nSweet Paradise_ is, of course, sweet, since we are three times told of\r\nit, once in the title and twice in the text. The SWEET _Pearmain_\r\nalso, is a “sweet apple” “of a very _saccharine_ flavor.” Of course it\r\nis _sweet_. Nos. 67, 68, 69, 74, 75, and very many more, are described\r\nwithout information as to their flavor except that, whatever it is, it\r\nis “brisk,” or “high,” or “rich”—forlorn adjectives unaffianced to any\r\nsubstantive which they may qualify. Sometimes the health of the tree\r\nand its hardiness are given, and as often omitted. Some times its\r\nhabit of bearing is mentioned, but oftener neglected. The color of the\r\nflesh is given in No. 82, but not in 83; in 84, but not in 85; from\r\n86-92 inclusive, but not to the _second_ 92, for the Bedfordshire\r\nFoundling and the Dutch Mignonne are both numbered 92. The color of\r\nthe flesh is not given in 93, 97, 100, 101, 103, 110, although the\r\nintermediate numbers have it given. Why should one be minutely\r\ndescribed, and another not all? We should regard it an ungrateful\r\nrequital for all the pleasure and profit which this volume has\r\nafforded us to hunt up and display what, to some, may seem to be mere\r\n“jots and tittles,” were it not that these, in themselves, unimportant\r\nthings mark decisively the absence in the author’s _plan_, of a style\r\nof description which pomology always needed, but now begins\r\nimperiously to demand. And we are confident that a pomological manual\r\n_on the right design_, is yet to be written. Our hearty wish is, that\r\nMr. Downing’s revised edition may be that manual.\r\n\r\n2. We are led, from these remarks, to consider, by itself, the\r\n_imperfect scale_ of descriptions adopted by all our American\r\npomological writers, upon which Mr. D. has not materially improved.\r\n\r\nThe description of the _tree_ is very meagre or totally neglected.\r\n_Nothing at all_ is said of it in cases out of the 174 apples numbered\r\nand described. The general shape of the tree is given in but\r\n_thirty-eight_ instances in the same number.\r\n\r\nThe _color of the wood_ is, usually, noticed in the account of pears;\r\nbut in the account of apples in not one case, we should think, in ten.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar _growth of the young wood_, in a great majority of cases,\r\nis not noticed; but more frequently in the pear than in the apple\r\nlist. The least practised observer knows how striking is this feature\r\nof the face of a tree. We do not remember an instance where the _buds_\r\nhave been employed as a characteristic. Are distinctive marks so\r\nnumerous that such a one as this can be spared? The shape, color,\r\nsize, prominence, and shoulder of buds, together with their\r\ninterstitial spaces, form too remarkable a portion of trees to be\r\nabsolutely overlooked in a book describing the “fruits and\r\n_fruit-trees_ of America.”\r\n\r\nEqually noticeable is the almost entire neglect of the _core and\r\nseed_, as identifying marks. Once in a while, as in the case of the\r\nBelle Fleur, the Roman Stem, the Spitzenberg, and the Pomme Royale, we\r\nare told, that the cores are hollow. But neither among pears nor\r\napples, is the core or seed made to be of any importance. This is the\r\nmore remarkable as being a decided _retrocession_ in the art of\r\ndescription. Prince, wisely following continental authors, is careful\r\nin his description of pears, to give, and with some minuteness, the\r\npeculiarities of the seed. But Downing injudiciously misled by, in\r\nthis respect, the decidedly bad example of British authors, has,\r\nalmost without exception, neglected this noble criterion. There is not\r\nanother single feature, either of fruit or fruit-trees, which we could\r\nnot spare better than the _core and seed_. Not only may varieties be\r\nmarked by their seeds, but they form, in connection with the core,\r\nimportant elements of diagnosis of _qualities_. A long-keeper, usually\r\nhas a very small, compact core, with few seeds. A highly improved and\r\nluscious pear, not unfrequently is wholly seedless; while fruits not\r\nfar removed from the wild state abound in seeds. Whenever a _system of\r\ndescription_ shall have been formed, we venture to predict that the\r\n_core and seed_ will be ranked at a higher value in it than any one\r\nother element of discrimination and description.\r\n\r\nThe same neglect or casual notice is bestowed upon the _leaf_. If\r\nanything about it is remarkable it is mentioned, not otherwise: but is\r\nthere a page of any book that was ever printed, that has more reading\r\non it than is on a leaf, if one is only taught to read it? _It_, too,\r\nis not only a sign of difference but very often of _quality_. Mr. D.\r\nhas availed himself of this criterion in describing peaches. Is it a\r\nlegible sign only in the peach orchard? He that is ignorant of these\r\nmarks, and only can tell one _fruit_ from another, is yet in the a b c\r\nof pomology. Who but a tyro, on importing _Coe’s Golden Drop_, would\r\nnot at once perceive the imposition, if there was one, the moment his\r\neye saw a bud, or its shoulder? Van Mons learned to select stocks for\r\nhis experiments, as well by the wood and bud in winter, as by the leaf\r\nand growth of summer. In a large bed of seedlings every experimenter\r\nought to know by wood and leaf what to select as prognosticating good\r\nfruit, and what to reject, without waiting to see the fruit.\r\nNurserymen of our acquaintance, without book, label, or stake, can\r\ntell every well-known variety on their grounds. One of our\r\nacquaintance never had a mark, label, stake, or register, of any kind\r\nupon his ground; a culpable reliance on his ability to read\r\ntree-faces; for, on his throwing up the business suddenly, his\r\nsuccessor fell into innumerable mistakes. It is just as easy for a\r\npomologist to know the face of every variety, as for a shepherd to\r\nknow the face of every sheep in his flock, or a grazier every animal\r\nof his herd.\r\n\r\n3. Although the “Fruit and Fruit-trees of America” professes to give\r\nthe process of management only for the _garden and the orchard_, it\r\nought to include, and we presume was designed to embrace the essential\r\nfeatures of nursery culture. Every cultivator of fruit must be a\r\nprivate nurseryman; he needs the same information, the same directions\r\nas if were a commercial gardener. He that designs planting an orchard\r\nought to know the _disposition_ of each variety of fruit-tree, that he\r\nmay suit the circumstances of his soil, or provide for the\r\npeculiarities of a tree, as a farmer needs to know the peculiarities\r\nof the different breeds of hogs and cattle. With a large number of\r\npersons it would be enough to say of fruits, “superb,” “extra-superb,”\r\n“superlatively grand,” “extra magnificent;” for such, a _princely_\r\ncatalogue would answer every purpose. But such as have some knowledge,\r\nand every year, we are happy to believe, the number of such increases,\r\nask, not the author’s bare eulogy, but a definite statement of all\r\nthose special qualities on which such eulogy is founded. The exact\r\n_taste_ of each variety of fruit should be studied in respect to soil;\r\nsome, and but few, love strong clays; yet fewer thrive upon wet soils;\r\nbut some will, as the Sweet or Carolina June, which does well on quite\r\nwet soils; some refuse their gifts except upon a warm and rich sand;\r\nsome, and by far the greatest number, love a deep loam, with a subsoil\r\nmoist without being wet. The buds of some varieties escape the vernal\r\nfrosts by their hardiness; some by putting forth later than their\r\norchard brethren. Some varieties thrive admirably by ground or root\r\ngrafting, while very many, so worked, are killed off during the first\r\nwinter; some varieties, if budded, grow off with alacrity, others are\r\ndull and unwilling; some form their tops with facility and beauty;\r\nothers, like many men, are rambling, awkward, and averse to any head\r\nat all. Some sorts, put upon what stock you will, have singularly\r\nmassive roots; others have fine and slender ones. Every variety of\r\ntree has traits of disposition peculiar to itself; and in respect to\r\ntraits possessed in common, even these may be classified. In every\r\ndescription there should be, at least, an attempt at giving these\r\nvarious nursery peculiarities. It cannot be done, as yet, with any\r\nconsiderable accuracy. _Fruit-trees have not yet been minutely\r\nstudied._ A florist can give you a thousand times more minute and\r\nspecial information in respect to the peculiar habits and wants of his\r\nflowers, than an orchardist can of his trees. Doubtless, it is easier\r\nto do it in plants which have a short period; whose whole life passes\r\nalong before the eye every season, than in plants whose very youth\r\noutlasts ten generations of Dahlias, Pansies, Balsams, etc. But that\r\nonly makes it the more important that we should be up and doing. Let\r\nno work be regarded as classic which does not take into its _design_\r\nthe most thorough enunciation of all the peculiarities of fruits, and\r\npomology will receive more advantage in ten years, than it could by a\r\nhundred years of rambling, unregulated, discursive descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe ability which Mr. D. has shown as a horticultural writer, his\r\nindustry in collecting materials for this, his last work; the skill\r\nwhich he has shown himself to possess in describing fruits, give the\r\npublic a right to expect that he will “go on unto perfection;” and if\r\nMr. D. will adopt a higher standard and set out with a design of a\r\nmore systematic description of fruits, every liberal cultivator in the\r\nland will be glad to put at his disposal whatever of minute\r\nobservation he may possess.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBuckwheat is a corruption rather than a translation of the Saxon word\r\n_Buckwaizen_, the first syllable signifying beech, the tree of that\r\nname, whose nut the kernel of the grain so much resembles in shape.\r\nThe grain, therefore, might be properly called beech-wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM A. J. DOWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe give below a letter from Mr. Downing, long known as an eminent\r\npomologist and more recently yet more distinguished for his writings\r\nupon Horticultural matters. Although a private letter, it is of\r\ngeneral interest, and he will, we hope, indulge the liberty taken.[13]\r\n\r\n                          “HIGHLAND GARDENS, NEWBURGH, NEW YORK,\r\n                                              _Feb. 29th, 1845_.\r\n\r\n     “MY DEAR SIR: I thank you for the interesting article on\r\n     horticulture in the West, which appears in the last No. of\r\n     _Hovey’s Magazine_.\r\n\r\n     “My particular object in writing you at this moment is to\r\n     call your attention to the remarks you make on the ‘Golden\r\n     Russet,’ which you call ‘the prince of small apples.’ From\r\n     your description of this fruit it is the ’sheep-nose,’ or\r\n     ‘Bullock’s Pippin’ of Coxe, well known here, and one of the\r\n     most melting and delicious of apples. I understand from\r\n     Professor Kirtland of Cleveland, that this is the apple\r\n     known by the name of Golden Russet in his region.\r\n\r\n     “Will you do me the favor, for the sake of settling the\r\n     synonyms, to send me two or three cuttings of the young\r\n     wood, by mail? I can then determine in a moment. The\r\n     Sheep-nose has long shoots of a peculiar _drab_ color. If\r\n     your apple proves the same, I think I shall cancel the title\r\n     ’sheep-nose’—(a vile name), known only in New Jersey, and\r\n     substitute ‘American Golden Russet’[14]—this being its\r\n     common title in New England and the West. I speak now in\r\n     relation to my work on fruits, now in press.\r\n\r\n     “What do you mean by the ‘White Bell-flower of Coxe?’ The\r\n     Detroit I have carefully examined, and it is quite different\r\n     from the Yellow Bellflower. The Monstrous Bellflower—the\r\n     only other one Coxe describes—is a large autumn fruit, while\r\n     the Detroit keeps till April?\r\n\r\n     “My work on Fruits has cost me a great deal of labor, but\r\n     will still contain many imperfections. When it is out of\r\n     press—in about six weeks—I promise myself the pleasure of\r\n     sending it with the copy of each of my previous works for\r\n     the acceptance of your Horticultural Society. And I then\r\n     hope to be favored with your criticism. Hoping an early\r\n     answer to my queries herein,\r\n\r\n                                    “I am sincerely yours,\r\n                                                 “A. J. DOWNING.\r\n\r\n     “H. W. BEECHER.”\r\n\r\nWe should have said “Monstrous Bellflower” instead of White.\r\n\r\nThe Bellflower here mentioned is the White or Green Bellflower of\r\nIndiana, the _Ohio Favorite_ of western Ohio about Dayton, etc., the\r\n_Hollow-cored Pippin of some_; and it has been inquired for, at Mr.\r\nAlldredge’s nursery, as the _Cumberland Spice_. Mr. A—— considered,\r\nfrom the description given, that the white Bellflower only could have\r\nbeen meant. But from the following description of Cumberland Spice in\r\nKenrick, from Coxe, I am inclined to think that the true Cumberland\r\nSpice may have been inquired for.\r\n\r\n“The tree is very productive; a fine dessert fruit, large, rather\r\noblong, contracted toward the summit; the stalk thick and short; of a\r\npale yellow color, clouded near the base; the flesh white, tender, and\r\nfine. It ripens in autumn, and keeps till winter, and shrivels in its\r\nlast stages.”\r\n\r\nThe fruit was brought to Wayne County, Indiana, by Mr. Brunson. He\r\ncame from New York to Huron county, Ohio, and thence to Wayne County,\r\nIndiana. It is universally diffused through the eastern and central\r\nparts of Indiana, and is esteemed a first-rate apple. The _tree_\r\nstrikingly resembles the Green Newtown Pippin, but its brush is not so\r\nsmall, and there is less of it, the top being rather more open. The\r\nwood is brittle, and, as the tree is a free and constant bearer, it\r\ntends to break, and is troublesome to keep in good order. Mr. Ernst\r\nand other gentlemen of Cincinnati suppose the variety to be the\r\n_Detroit_. We cannot say one thing or another, except that it is of\r\nthe Bellflower family. The Detroit of New York is a widely different\r\nfruit, of a bright scarlet color, and we never heard of any other\r\n_Detroit_, until the name was applied to this apple.\r\n\r\nThere is not the least doubt that the _Golden Russet_ of the West is\r\nthe _Bullock Pippin_ and _Sheep-nose_ of New Jersey, and we hope that\r\nthe proposed name “_American Golden Russet_” will deliver us, for ever\r\nafter, from eating any more _sheep-noses_. Names are of importance in\r\nclassifying fruits, and there is a pleasure also in having a decorous\r\nname to a good fruit. It is amusing to look through a catalogue of\r\nsingular names.\r\n\r\nThe _Hoss_ apple is popularly the _Horse_ apple, and when, on a\r\ncertain contingency a gentleman promised to eat a _hoss_ it was not so\r\nhazardous a threat as some have imagined. The French, in naming their\r\nfruits, exercise a freedom with things human and divine, to which we\r\noccidentals are not accustomed (as, _Ah Mon Dieu! Grosse Cuisse\r\nMadame_, etc.), and an innocent person, recapitulating his pears,\r\nmight, if overheard by neighbors understanding French, be thought very\r\nprofane, or worse. There are other names which have a tendency to make\r\nthe mouth water, as _Onion Pear_. One must have pleasing associations\r\nwhile eating the _Toad Pear_. (See Prince’s Pom. Man. p. 24 and 34.)\r\nThe French _Bon Chrétien_ (or Good Christian) is called in these parts\r\nthe _Bon Cheat-em_. Then, there is the Demoiselle, the Lady’s Flesh,\r\nand Love’s Pear (Prince, 58, 34, and 117)—very proper for young\r\nlovers. Then, there is the _Burnt Cat_ (_Chat Bruslé_ of the French,\r\nPrince 89), which undoubtedly has a musk flavor. We have less\r\nobjection to the _Priest’s Pear_ (_Poire de Prêtre_, Prince, 108).\r\nPiscatory gentlemen would always angle in our nurseries for the\r\n_Trout_ pear (Prince 130), and if they did not get a bite, the pear\r\n_would_, as it is a fine variety. How did those who named pears,\r\n_Louise Bonne de Jersey_, or _Van Mons leon le clerc_, expect common\r\nfolks to hold fast to the true name? But he must have a short memory\r\nindeed, who forgets the emphatic name of _Yat_ or _Yut_.\r\n\r\nBut to return from our digression. We give the description of the\r\nGolden Russet from three sources, and indorse their general accuracy:\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDEN RUSSET.—(DR. PLUMMER.)\r\n\r\n“SIZE.—2 2-10 inches long; 2 7-10 inches wide.\r\n\r\n“FORM.—Rather smaller at the summit; moderately flattened at the ends.\r\n\r\n“PULP.—Very tender, juicy, yellowish white.\r\n\r\n“COLOR.—Deep yellow, with brown and russet clouds; or wholly brown and\r\nrusset.\r\n\r\n“SURFACE.—Nearly dull; ruffled by the confluent lineoles; dots hardly\r\ndiscoverable.\r\n\r\n“FLAVOR.—Sweet and delicious.\r\n\r\n“STEM.—Slender; half to one inch long, reaching to a considerable\r\ndistance beyond the verge.\r\n\r\n“EYE.—In rather contracted cavity; closed.\r\n\r\n“Ripens in the tenth month.\r\n\r\n“It is one of our best apples, and keeps well through the winter.”\r\n\r\n“Whether the Leathercoat and the Glass apple are the same as are now\r\nknown under those names, it is impossible to determine. Near\r\nPoughkeepsie, in the State of New York, the Leathercoat used to be a\r\nfavorite fruit; and whether it is the same as the Golden Russet,\r\ndescribed above, I am not now able to say; but my recollection of that\r\napple after a lapse of twenty-three years, induces me to think it is\r\nno other than the Golden Russet; and, indeed, Trevelyan calls it also\r\nthe ‘_russet_ appell.’ The Glass apple was described in a former\r\nnumber of ‘The Orchard.’ If the ‘lethercott’ has descended to us under\r\nthe name of Golden Russet, the fine flavor of this apple would lead us\r\nto believe that it had not deteriorated, after a period of more than\r\ntwo centuries and a half.”—_West. Farm. and Gard._, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLOCK’s PIPPIN, OR SHEEP-NOSE.—(COXE.)\r\n\r\n_Golden Russet of Cincinnati. Golden Russet of the Eastern\r\nnurseries._—(_Dr. Kirtland._)\r\n\r\n“Neither the size nor appearance of this fruit would attract\r\nattention; yet it sells more readily in markets where it is known than\r\nany other apple. Its flavor is rich and pleasant, and many people\r\nconsider it the best fruit of the season. In northern Ohio it matures\r\nat New-Year’s, while in Cincinnati it is in perfection in\r\nNovember.”—_West. Farm. and Gard._, 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDEN RUSSET—BULLOCK PIPPIN, OR SHEEP-NOSE.—(A. HAMPTON.)\r\n\r\n“This apple is below medium size; the skin is yellow, inclined to a\r\nrusset; the flesh yellow, rich, juicy, tender and sprightly. I know of\r\nno apple more generally admired for its richness and excellent flavor\r\nthan this; commanding a high price, and ready sale, in market; it\r\nmakes very rich cider; a great and constant bearer; and keeps well\r\ntill spring.”—_West. Farm. and Gard._, 1841.\r\n\r\nWe do not know another apple whose _flavor_ and _flesh_ are so\r\nadmirable. A gentleman in Ohio, on being asked for a list of a hundred\r\ntrees for an orchard, replied, “set out ninety-nine Golden Russets,\r\nthe other one you can choose for yourself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     [13] Mr. Downing’s untimely end by drowning is well known.\r\n\r\n     [14] There is an English Golden Russet, distinct and quite\r\n     acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTENTION TO ORCHARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nClean out your orchards. Let no branches lie scattered around. If in\r\ncrops, let the tillage be thorough and clean. In plowing near the tree\r\nbe careful not to strike deep enough to lacerate the small roots and\r\nfibres. An orchard should be tended with a _cultivator_ rather than a\r\nplow, and the space immediately about the tree should be worked with a\r\nhoe. Look to the fence corners, and grub out all bushes, briers and\r\nweeds. A fine orchard with such a ruffle around it, is like a handsome\r\nwoman with dirty ears and neck.\r\n\r\n_Pruning_ may still be performed. Those who are raising young orchards\r\nought not to prune at _any_ particular time between May and August,\r\nbut _all along_ the season, as the tree needs it. If a bad branch is\r\nforming, take it out while it is small; if too many are starting, rub\r\nthem out while so tender as to be managed without a knife and by the\r\nfingers. If an orchard is rightly educated from the first, there will\r\nseldom be a limb to be cut of larger than a little finger, and a\r\npen-knife will be large enough for pruning. In the West there is more\r\ndanger of pruning too much, than too little. The sun should never be\r\nallowed to strike the inside branches of a fruit-tree. Many trees are\r\nthus very much weakened and even killed if the sun is violently warm.\r\nOver-pruning induces the growth of shoots at the root, along the\r\ntrunk, and all along the branches.\r\n\r\n_Grub up suckers_, and clear off from large and well established trees\r\nall side-shoots. After a tree is three inches in diameter through the\r\nstem, it may be kept entirely free of side shoots. But young trees are\r\nmuch assisted in every respect, except appearance, by letting brush\r\ngrow the whole length of their stem, only pinching off the ends of the\r\nwhips, if they grow too rampantly. In this way the leaves afford great\r\nstrength to the trunk, and prevent its being spindling or weak-fibred.\r\n\r\n_Scour off the dead bark_, which, besides being unsightly, is a harbor\r\nfor a great variety of insects, and affords numerous crevices for\r\nwater to stand in. We have previously recommended soft soap, thinned\r\nwith urine to the consistence of paint, as a wash for trees; we have\r\nseen nothing better.\r\n\r\n_Examine grafts_ if any have been put in. See if the wax excludes the\r\nair entirely; rub out all shoots which threaten to overgrow and\r\nexhaust the graft; if it is growing too strongly, it must be\r\nsupported, or it will blow out in some high wind.\r\n\r\nLOOK OUT FOR BLIGHT.—All trees that have shown no indications of\r\nblight, will be safe for the season. But those which have shown the\r\naffection may be expected to continue to break out through the season.\r\nIt is all important to use the knife freely; for although there is no\r\ncontagion from tree to tree, yet the diseased sap will, in the same\r\ntree, be conveyed from part to part over the whole fabric. But prompt\r\npruning will remove the seat and source of the evil. Where a branch is\r\naffected, cut chips out of the bark along down for yards; indeed,\r\nexamine the limb entirely home to the trunk, and you may easily detect\r\nany spots which are depositories of this diseased sap, which, by its\r\ncolor, and whole appearance, will be identified by the most\r\nunpractised eye. Cut everything, below and aloft, that has this\r\nfeculent sap in it, even if you take off the whole head by the trunk,\r\nand leave only a stump; for, the stump may send new shoots; but if the\r\ntree is spared from false tenderness you will lose it, bough, trunk,\r\nand root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINE AND HORTICULTURE.\r\n\r\n  “_Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his color\r\n    in the cup, when it moveth itself aright._”\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, the Cincinnati Horticultural Society appointed a committee to do\r\njust what Solomon says must not be done. Their report is a very artful\r\ndocument, so drawn up that the unwary would suppose that this was a\r\nmere business affair—passing off quite respectably. But we were not to\r\nbe deceived; we instantly saw through it; and pencil in hand, we noted\r\nall places in the report proper to shock a true Washingtonian heart.\r\n\r\nAlthough the array of forty kinds of wine save one, did not intimidate\r\nthese hitherto respectable gentlemen, it inspired them with prudence;\r\nand a German Committee called in, to ferret out any foreign wines\r\nwhich might have been smuggled in to the confusion of the judges.\r\n\r\nThe committee only darkly intimate their _modus operandi_; if they had\r\ngiven us a journal of their doings, made out on the spot, by some\r\ntrusty clerk, what a bacchanal mystery would have been disclosed! but\r\nthey had discretion enough left to defer this until they were sober\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut Washingtonianism is abroad, and can detect all the mysteries of\r\nebriety, however graced with authority from a Horticultural Society.\r\nWe can imagine the impatience with which the bottles were\r\npreliminarily eyed—the entire moderation with which each sipped a few\r\nfirst specimens; we can see them gradually warming with their\r\nsubject—through tasting with alacrity—nodding at each other, squinting\r\nthe ruddy glass, smacking their too often dewy lips, or wagging their\r\nheads with more than ordinary satisfaction as a beaker of great merit\r\nmade the _facilis descensus averni_. Laughter interrupts sober\r\nattention to business; in vain the chairman thumps the table for\r\norder; he gets more jokes than attention. Many a sly story is told;\r\nsome of them have visited wine countries and now begin long yarns\r\nthereof; the clamor of laughing, and anecdote, and criticism—the\r\nnecessity, in consequence, of re-tasting, and tasting again to arrive\r\nat a conclusion, brought them, we doubt not, to a most lamentable\r\nconclusion, although the report only obscurely hints of it, as we\r\nshall see. Had any of them married into the Caudle connection we might\r\nhave had a graphic account of their several arrivals at their homes—at\r\nwhat time, by whose help, in what condition, etc.\r\n\r\nThe tabular report given in has evidently been studiously framed. We\r\nsuspect that if the opinions had been set down just in the order of\r\ntheir occurrence, they would have afforded an index of the condition\r\nof the committee as well as of the wine. But though they have mixed\r\nthem up, they cannot elude our vigilance—we can pick out the\r\nchronological order. At first such opinions as these were given:\r\n“Tolerably good,” “Inferior,” “Poor, fermented on skins.” They were\r\ncritical yet; but warming a little they express more generous\r\nsentiments; “Good,” “Very good Cape,” “Very good, resembling old\r\nMadeira.” The next step shows the genial advance—some were getting\r\ndisputatious. “Good, considered by some better than No. 8, by others\r\nnot so good,”—they evidently had a row about it. They next advanced\r\ninto the patriotic mood as is seen in the judgment of our foreign\r\nwines, “Good dry wine, but supposed to be foreign,” “Inferior, a\r\nforeign wine,” “Not American wine.” Here the gradations of contempt\r\nare very plain. We have next, melancholy evidence of their progress in\r\nthe necessity of a stronger body to their wines,—“Not liked, supposed\r\nto have been injured in the bottle.” Why not say it right out, that it\r\nwas a weak, thin wine? Here we have it, “_Good strong_ wine.” The last\r\nrecord made is “Good new, not in a state for judgment.” Does this\r\nrefer to the wine or to the committee? To the latter we suppose; and\r\nat this point, probably perceiving their condition, they laid aside\r\ntheir official character and made it a private, personal, and somewhat\r\nmiscellaneous affair. We see now the meaning of a sentence which\r\nfollows the tabular exhibit: “The judgments pronounced and recorded in\r\nthe foregoing table, were as nearly unanimous as can ever be expected\r\namong so many judges.”\r\n\r\nThe committee state in respect to western wines: “That the pure juice\r\nof the grape when judiciously managed will furnish the finest kind of\r\nwine, without any addition or mixture whatever; that no saccharine\r\naddition is necessary to give it sufficient body to keep for any\r\nlength of time in this climate.”\r\n\r\nWe submit that the _keeping_ properties of wine are not altogether\r\nintrinsic; but depend much upon the persons having access to them, or,\r\nas we were taught in school, “on time, place, and person.” In _our_\r\ncellar American wines would doubtless have great longevity. We wish to\r\ncall the attention of Mr. Gough to the closing sentence of the report:\r\n“A taste for the wines of this region appears to be well established,\r\nsince all that can be produced finds a ready market at good prices;\r\nand the committee are of opinion, that the period is not distant when\r\nthe wines of the Ohio will enjoy a celebrity equal to those of the\r\nRhine.”\r\n\r\nHere’s work on hand for him. In conclusion, we respectfully suggest\r\nthat the same committee be continued from year to year, as there is no\r\nuse in spoiling a fresh set every year. If the specimens multiply,\r\nperhaps more help will be required—at any rate a by-law should be\r\npassed, so that there shall be one committee-man to at least every ten\r\nbottles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDO VARIETIES OF FRUIT RUN OUT?\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there such similarity between animals and vegetables, in their\r\norganic structure, development and functions, as to make it safe to\r\nreason upon the properties of the one from the known properties of the\r\nother?\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that the lowest forms of vegetable existence are\r\nextremely difficult to be distinguished from a corresponding form of\r\nanimal existence. As we approach the lower confines of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, flowers, and of course, seeds, disappear. The distinction\r\nbetween leaves and stem ceases; and, at last, the stem and root are no\r\nlonger to be separated, and we find a mere vegetable sheet or lamina\r\nwhose upper surface is leaf and whose lower surface is root. In a\r\ncorresponding sphere, animal existence is reduced to its simplest\r\nelements. Whatever resemblances there are in the lowest and\r\nrudimentary forms of vegetable and animal life, it cannot be doubted\r\nthat when we rise to a more perfect organization, the two kingdom\r\nbecome distinct and the structure and functions of each are in such a\r\nsense peculiar to itself, that he will grossly misconceive the truth\r\nwho supposes a structure or a function to exist in a vegetable,\r\nbecause such structure or function exists in an animal, and _vice\r\nversâ_. To be sure, they resemble in _generals_ but they differ in\r\n_specials_. Both begin in a seminal point but the seed is not\r\nanalogous; both develop—but not by an analogous growth; both require\r\nfood, but the selection, the digestion and the assimilation are\r\ndifferent. The mineral kingdom is the lowest. Out of it, by help of\r\nthe sun and air, the vegetable procures its materials of growth; in\r\nturn the vegetable kingdom is the magazine from which the animal\r\nkingdom is sustained; to each, thus the soil contains the original\r\nelements; the vegetable is the chemical manipulator, and the animal,\r\nthe final recipient of its products. The habit of reasoning from one\r\nto the other, of giving an idea of the one by illustrations drawn from\r\nthe other, especially in popular writings, will always be fruitful of\r\nmisconceptions and mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe next idea set forth in the paragraph which we review, is, the\r\n_essential dissimilarity of buds and seeds_. The writer thinks that a\r\nplant from a seed is a _new_ organization, but a plant from a bud or\r\ngraft (which is but a developed bud) is but a continuation of a\r\nprevious plant. With the exception of their integuments, a bud and a\r\nseed are the _same thing_. A seed is a bud prepared for one set of\r\ncircumstances, and a bud is a seed prepared for another set of\r\ncircumstances—it is the same embryo in different garments. The seed\r\nhas been called, therefore, a “primary bud,” the difference beng one\r\nof _condition_ and not of _nature_.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest, then, that the plant which springs from a bud is as\r\nreally a new plant as that which springs from a seed; and it is\r\nequally true, that a seed may convey the weakness and diseases of its\r\nparent with as much facility as a bud or a graft does. If the\r\nfeebleness of a tree is general, its functions languid, its secretions\r\nthin, then a bud or graft will be feeble,—and so would be its seed; or\r\nif a tree be thoroughly tainted with disease, the buds would not\r\nescape, nor the tree springing from them—neither would its seed, or a\r\ntree springing from it. A tree from a _bud_ of the Doyenne pear is\r\njust as much a new tree as one from its _seed_.\r\n\r\nThe idea which we controvert has received encouragement from the fact,\r\nthat a bud produces a fruit like the parent tree, while, oftentimes, a\r\nseed yields only a _variety_ of such fruit. But, it is probable that\r\nthis is never the case with seeds except when they have been brought\r\ninto a state of what Van Mons calls variation. In their natural and\r\nuncultivated state, seeds will reproduce their parent with as much\r\nfidelity as a bud or a graft.\r\n\r\nThe liability of a variety to run out, when propagated by bud or\r\ngraft, is not a whit greater than when propagated by seed, _in so far\r\nas the nature of the vegetable is concerned_.\r\n\r\nBut it is true that the conditions in which a bud grows render it\r\nliable to extrinsic ills not incidental to a plant springing from\r\nseed. A seed, emitting its roots directly into the earth, is liable\r\nonly to its own ills; a bud or graft emitting roots, through the\r\nalburnum of the stock on which it is established, into the earth, is\r\nsubject to the infirmities of the stock as well as to its own. Thus a\r\nhealthy seed produces a healthy plant. A healthy bud may produce a\r\nfeeble plant, because inoculated upon a diseased branch or stem.\r\n\r\nInstead of a limitation in their nature, there is reason to suppose\r\nthat trees might flourish to an indefinite age were it not for\r\nextrinsic difficulties. A tree, unlike an animal, is not a single,\r\nsimple organization, it is rather a _community_ of plants. Every bud\r\nseparately is an elementary plant, capable, if disjoined from the\r\nbranch, of becoming a tree by itself. In fact, each bud emits roots,\r\nwhich, uniting together, go down upon a common support (the trunk) and\r\nenter the earth, and are there put in connection with appropriate\r\nfood. Every fibre of root may be traced upward to its bud from which\r\nit issued.\r\n\r\nIn process of time, the elongation of the trunk exposes it to\r\naccidents; the branches are subject to the force of storms; in\r\nproportion as the distance from the roots increases, and the longer\r\nthe passages through which the upper sap, or downward elaborated sap\r\ntravels, the more liabilities are there to stoppage and injury. The\r\nreason of decline in a tree is not to be looked for in any exhaustion\r\nof vital force in the organization itself, but it is to be found in\r\nthe immense surface and substance exposed to the wear and tear of the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, if this view be true, that no bounds can be placed to\r\nthe duration of perennial plants, if, by any means, we could diminish\r\ntheir exposure, by reducing their expansion, by keeping them within a\r\ncertain sphere of growth. _Now this is exactly what is accomplished by\r\nbudding._ A bud, far removed on the parent stock from the root and\r\nconnected with it through a long trunk, is inoculated upon a new\r\nstock. It now grows with a comparatively limited exposure to\r\ninterruption or accident. The connection with the soil is short and\r\ndirect.\r\n\r\nIn this manner a variety of fruit may be perpetuated to all\r\ngenerations, _if the laws of vegetable health be regarded in the\r\nprocess_. Healthy buds, worked upon healthy stocks and planted in\r\nwholesome soil, will make healthy trees; and from these another\r\ngeneration may proceed, and from these another. By a due regard to\r\nvegetable physiology, the Newtown Pippin, and the Seckle Pear, may be\r\neaten two thousand years hence, _provided_, _always_, that expounders\r\nof prophesy will allow us the use of the earth so long for orchard\r\npurposes. A disregard of the laws of vegetable physiology in the\r\npropagation of varieties, will, on the other hand, rapidly deteriorate\r\nthe most healthy sort. There is no clock-work in the branches of the\r\ntree, which finally runs down past all winding up; there is no fixed\r\nquantity of vitality, which a variety at length uses up, as a garrison\r\ndoes its bread. Plants renew themselves and every year have a fresh\r\nlife, and, in this respect, they differ essentially from all forms of\r\nanimal existence. Any _one tree_ may wear out; but a _variety_, never.\r\n\r\nWe need not say, therefore, that we dissent from Knight’s theory of\r\nnatural exhaustion and from every supplement to it put forth since his\r\nday. Van Mons’ theory of _variation_ and the tendency of plants to\r\nreturn toward their original type, is to be regarded as nearer the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAWBERRY CONTROVERSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man will deny that in their cultivated state, strawberries are\r\nfound, in respect to their blossoms, in three conditions: first,\r\nblossoms with stamens alone, the pistillate organs being mere\r\nrudiments; second, blossoms with pistillate organs developed fully,\r\nbut the stamens very imperfect, and inefficient; third, blossoms in\r\nwhich staminate and pistillate organs are both about equally\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThere are two questions arising on this state of facts; one, a\r\nquestion of mere vegetable physiology, viz., Is such a state of\r\norganization peculiar to this plant originally, or is it induced by\r\ncultivation? The other question is one of eminent practical\r\nimportance, viz., What effect has this state of organization upon the\r\nsuccess of cultivation?\r\n\r\nPassing by the first question, for the present, we would say of the\r\nsecond that, a _substantial_ agreement has at length, been obtained.\r\nIt is on all hands conceded that staminate plants, or those possessing\r\nonly stamens, and not pistillate organs, are unfruitful. Any other\r\nopinion would now be regarded as an absurdity. It is equally well\r\nunderstood that pistillate plants, or those in which the female organs\r\nare fully, and the male organs scarcely at all developed, are\r\nunfruitful. No one would attempt to breed a herd of cattle from males\r\n_exclusively_, or from _females_; and, for precisely the same reason,\r\nstrawberries cannot be had from plants substantially male, or\r\nsubstantially female, where each are kept to themselves.\r\n\r\nBut a difference yet exists among cultivators as to the facts\r\nrespecting those blossoms which contain _both_ male and female organs,\r\nor, as they are called, _perfect_ flowering plants.\r\n\r\nMr. Longworth states, if we understand him, substantially, that\r\nperfect-flowering varieties will bear but moderate crops, and,\r\nusually, of small fruit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Dr. Brinkle, whose seedling strawberries we noticed\r\nin a former article, Mr. Downing, and several other eminent\r\ncultivators adopt the contrary opinion, that, _with care_, large crops\r\nof large fruit may be obtained from perfect-flowering plants. This\r\nquestion is yet, then, to be settled.\r\n\r\nIt is ardently to be hoped that, hereafter, we shall have less\r\npremature and positive assertion, upon unripe observations, than has\r\ncharacterized the early stages of this controversy. We will take the\r\nliberty of following Mr. Hovey in his magazine, between the years 1842\r\nand 1846, not for any pleasure that we have in the singular\r\nvicissitudes of opinion chronicled there, but because an eminent\r\ncultivator, writer, and editor of, hitherto, the only horticultural\r\nmagazine in our country, has such influence and authority in forming\r\nthe morals and customs of the kingdom of Horticulture, that every free\r\nsubject of this beautiful realm is interested to have its chiefs men\r\nof such accuracy that it will not be dangerous to take their\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, Mr. Longworth communicated an article on the fertile and\r\nsterile characters of several varieties of strawberries for Mr.\r\nHovey’s magazine, which Mr. H. for subject-matter, indorsed. In the\r\nNovember number, Mr. Colt substantially advocated the sentiments of\r\nMr. L.; and the editor, remarking upon Mr. Coit’s article, recognized\r\ndistinctly the existence of male and female plants.\r\n\r\nHe (Mr. H.) says that, of four kinds mentioned by Mr. C. as\r\nunfruitful, two were so “_from the want of staminate_ or _male\r\nplants_;” and “the cause of the barrenness _is thus easily\r\nexplained_.” And he goes on to explain divers cases upon this\r\nhypothesis; and still more resolutely he says, that all wild\r\nstrawberries have not perfect flowers; “in a dozen or two plants which\r\nwe examined last spring _some were perfect_ (the italics are ours)\r\nhaving both stamens and pistils; _others, only pistils_, and _others,\r\nonly stamens_; thus showing that the _defect, mentioned by Mr.\r\nLongworth, exists in the original species_.” He closes by urging\r\ncultivators to set rows of early Virginia among the beds for the sake\r\nof impregnating the rest.\r\n\r\nMr. Hovey’s next formal notice was exactly one year from the\r\nforegoing, November, 1843, and it appears thus: “We believe it is now\r\nthe generally received opinion _of all intelligent cultivators_\r\n(italics are ours again) that there is _no necessity of making any\r\ndistinction in regard to the sexual character of the plants When\r\nforming new beds. The idea of male and female flowers_, first\r\noriginated, we believe, by Mr. Longworth, of Ohio, is now considered\r\n_as exploded_.” Such a sudden change as this was brought about, he\r\nsays, by additional information received during that year by means of\r\nhis correspondents, and by more experience on his own part. He says\r\nnothing of male blossoms and female blossoms, _which he had himself\r\nseen in wild strawberries_. Mr. Hovey then assumed the theory that\r\n_cultivation_, good or bad, is the cause of fertile or unfertile beds\r\nof strawberries, and he says: “in conclusion, we think we may safely\r\naver, that there is not the least necessity of cultivating _any one\r\nstrawberry near another_ (our italics) to insure the fertility of the\r\nplants, _provided_ they are under a proper state of cultivation.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hovey now instituted experiments, which he promised to publish, by\r\nwhich to bring the matter to the only true test; and he, from time to\r\ntime, re-promised to give the result to the public, which, thus far,\r\nwe believe, he has forgotten to do.\r\n\r\nHis magazine for 1844 opens, as that of 1843 closed; and in the first\r\nnumber he says, “the oftener our attention is called to this subject,\r\nthe more we feel confirmed in the opinon that the theory of Mr.\r\nLongworth is entirely unfounded; that there is _no such thing as male\r\nand female plants_, though certain causes may produce, as we know they\r\nhave, fertile and sterile ones.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the next issue but one this peremptory language is\r\nagain softened down, and a doubt even appears, when he says, “IF _Mr.\r\nLongworth’s theory should prove true_,” _etc._ We, among others,\r\nwaited anxiously for the promised experiments; but if published we\r\nnever saw them. The subject rather died out of his magazine until\r\nAugust, 1845, when, in speaking of the Boston Pine, a second fine\r\nseedling of his own raising, he is seen bearing away on the other\r\ntack, if not with _all_ sails set, yet with enough to give the ship\r\nheadway in the right direction: “Let the causes be what they may, it\r\nis sufficient for all practical purposes, to know, that _the most\r\nabundant crops_ (italics ours) can be produced by planting some sort\r\nabounding in _staminate_ flowers, in the near vicinity of those which\r\ndo not possess them.” P. 293. And on p. 444 he reiterates the advice\r\nto plant near the staminate varieties. In the August number for 1846,\r\np. 309, Mr. Hovey shows himself a thorough convert to Mr. Longworth’s\r\nviews, by indorsing, in the main, the report of the committee of the\r\nCincinnati Horticultural Society. We hope after so various a voyage,\r\ntouching at so many points, that he will now abide steadfast in the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nWe look upon this as a very grave matter, not because the strawberry\r\nquestion is of such paramount, although it is of no inconsiderable\r\nimportance; but it is of importance whether accredited scientific\r\nmagazines should be trustworthy; whether writers or popular editors\r\nshould be responsible for mistakes entirely unnecessary. We blame no\r\nman for vacillation, while yet in the process of investigation, nor\r\nfor coming at the truth gradually, since this is the necessity of our\r\ncondition to learn only by degrees, and by painful siftings. The very\r\nfirst requisite for a writer is, that he be worthy of trust in his\r\nstatements. No man can be trusted who ventures opinions upon\r\nuninvestigated matters; who states facts with assurance which he has\r\nnot really ascertained; who evinces rashness, haste, carelessness,\r\ncredulity, or fickleness in his judgments. The question of perfect or\r\nimperfect blossoms depends upon the simplest exercise of eyesight. It\r\nrequires no measurements, no process of the laboratory, no minute\r\ndissections or nice calculations; it requires only that a man should\r\n_see_ what he _looks_ at.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy, playing “how many fingers do I hold up,” by dint of\r\npeeping from under the bandage, we managed to make very clever guesses\r\nof how many lily-fingers some roguish lassie was holding in tempting\r\nshow before our bandaged eyes; but some folks are not half so lucky\r\nwith both eyes wide open, and the stamens and pistils standing before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf such a latitude is permitted to those who conduct the\r\ninvestigations peculiar to horticulture, who can confide in the\r\npublication of facts, observations or experiments? Of what use will be\r\njournals and magazines? They become like chronometers that will not\r\nkeep time; like a compass that has lost its magnetic sensibility; like\r\na guide who has lost his own way, and leads his followers through\r\nbrake, and morass, and thicket, into interminable wanderings.\r\nSometimes, the consciousness of faults in ourselves, which should make\r\nus lenient toward others, only serves to produce irritable\r\nfault-finding. After a comparison of opinions and facts, through a\r\nspace of five years, with the most distinguished cultivators, East and\r\nWest, Mr. Longworth is now universally admitted to have sustained\r\nhimself in all the essential points which he first promulgated—not\r\n_discovered_, for he made no claims of that sort. The gardeners and\r\nthe magazines of the East have, at length, adopted his practical\r\nviews, after having stoutly, many of them, contested them.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, with unfeigned surprise, that we read Mr. Hovey’s\r\nlatest remarks in the September number of his magazine, in which, with\r\nsome asperity, he roundly charges Mr. Longworth with manifold errors,\r\nand treats him with a contempt which would lead one, ignorant of the\r\ncontroversy, to suppose that Mr. Hovey had never made a mistake, and\r\nthat Mr. Longworth had been particularly fertile of them. Thus: “Mr.\r\nLongworth’s remarks abound in so many errors and inconsistencies, that\r\nwe shall expect scarcely to notice all.” “Another _gross assertion_,”\r\netc. Referring to another topic, he says, “This question we,\r\ntherefore, consider as satisfactorily settled, without discussing Mr.\r\nLongworth’s conflicting views about male and female, Keen’s,” etc.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat tragical comedy is now nearly played out, and we have\r\nspoken a word just before the fall of the curtain, because, as\r\nchroniclers of events, and critics of horticultural literature and\r\nlearning, it seemed no less than our duty. We have highly appreciated\r\nMr. Hovey’s various exertions for the promotion of the art and science\r\nof horticulture, nor will his manifest errors and short-comings in\r\nthis particular instance, disincline us to receive from his pen\r\nwhatsoever is good.\r\n\r\nWe hope that our remarks will not be construed as a defence of western\r\nmen or western theories, but as the defence of the truth, and of one\r\nwho has truly expounded it, though, in this case, theory and its\r\ndefender happen to be of western origin. Whatever errors have crept\r\ninto Mr. Longworth’s remarks should be faithfully expurgated; and\r\nperhaps it may be Mr. Hovey’s duty to perform the lustration. If so,\r\ncourtesy would seem to require that it should be done with some\r\nconsciousness, that through this whole controversy Mr. Longworth is\r\nnow admitted to have been right in all essential matters; and if in\r\nerror at all, only in minor particulars, while Mr. Hovey, in all the\r\ncontroversy, in respect to the plainest facts, has been changing from\r\nwrong to right, from right to wrong, and from wrong back to right\r\nagain. We do not think that the admirable benefits which Mr. Longworth\r\nhas conferred upon the whole community by urging the improved method\r\nof cultivating the strawberry, has been adequately appreciated. We\r\nstill less like to see gratitude expressed in the shape of snarling\r\ngibes and petty cavils.\r\n\r\nWe will close these remarks by the correction of a matter which Mr.\r\nDowning states. While he assents to all the _practical_ aspects of Mr.\r\nLongworth’s views, he dissents as to some matters of fact and\r\nphilosophy, and among others, to the fact that Hovey’s seedling is\r\n_always_ and _only_ a pistillate plant. He thinks that originally it\r\nhad _perfect_ flowers, but that after bearing twice or thrice on the\r\nsame roots the plants degenerate and become either pistillate or\r\nstaminate. He says, “Hovey’s seedling strawberry, at first, was a\r\nperfect sort in its flower, but at this moment more than half the\r\nplants in this country have become pistillate.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hovey himself states the contrary on p. 112 of his magazine for\r\n1844. He denies that there are two kinds of blossoms to his seedling,\r\nand says, “the flowers are all of one kind, with both pistils and\r\nstamens, _but the latter quite short and hidden under the\r\nreceptacle_.” This is the common form of all _pistillate_ blossoms,\r\nand shows, in so far as Mr. Hovey’s observations are to be trusted,\r\nthat, at its starting-point and home, Hovey’s seedling was, as with us\r\nit now invariably is, so far as we have ever seen it, a pistillate plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for the culture of the strawberry will vary with\r\ncircumstances; as, whether it is raised for private use, or for\r\nmarket. But, for whatever purpose cultivated, respect must be\r\ninvariably had to the fact of staminate and pistillate flowers, or\r\nmale and female. Each flower contains the rudiments of both the male\r\nand female organs. But the male organs are more or less defective in\r\none set of plants and the female in another “and, in the Hudson and\r\nsome others, it amounts to a complete separation of the sexes. In some\r\nof the male (staminate) varieties more or less of the blossoms are\r\nalso partially perfect in the female organs and will produce some\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n     “Every flower contains both the male and female organs; and,\r\n     in the white and monthly, both organs are always perfect in\r\n     the same blossom, as far as my experience goes. In other\r\n     kinds, the male organs are more or less defective in one set\r\n     of plants, and the female in the other; and, in the Hudson\r\n     and some other varieties, it amounts to a complete\r\n     separation of the sexes. The male organs are so defective in\r\n     one set of plants, and the female in the other, that an acre\r\n     of either would not produce a single fruit. In some of the\r\n     male (staminate) varieties, more or less of the blossoms are\r\n     also more or less perfect in the female organs, and will\r\n     produce more or less fruit; but I have never seen a female\r\n     plant with the male organs sufficiently developed to produce\r\n     a single perfect fruit. Hovey’s seedling, and some others,\r\n     may produce deformed berries.”—_Longworth._\r\n\r\nMr. Longworth, in consequence of this fact, always has a compartment\r\nallotted to male and one to female plants, and out of these he forms\r\nhis beds, being able thus to insure a proper proportion of males to\r\nfemales. Mr. S. S. Jackson, a very skillful nurseryman of Cincinnati,\r\nusually, in selling plants, puts up ninety females to ten males in the\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nWe shall now give the time and manner of planting of some of the best\r\ncultivators in the West, at the East, and in England.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Jackson says: “I plant any time from the first of April,\r\n     till they are in bloom. I, one year, planted twenty-five\r\n     square roods of ground; the plants were all in bloom when\r\n     set out; and the next year I picked thirty-eight bushels,\r\n     and there were fully ten bushels left on the vines.\r\n\r\n     “I plant them in this way: first plow or spade the ground;\r\n     harrow it smooth; then strain a line on one side nine inches\r\n     from the edge, and a row from twelve to fifteen inches\r\n     apart; then move the line eighteen inches, and plant another\r\n     row; then move it three feet, and again eighteen inches—and\r\n     so on till the ground is planted. I then go over and put one\r\n     male plant every six feet, between the two rows. Keep them\r\n     clear of weeds through the summer, and let them spread as\r\n     much as they will.\r\n\r\n     “In the fall dress the out-walks eighteen inches wide, which\r\n     will leave the beds three feet wide; and when it sets in\r\n     cold, give them a light covering of straw; rake it off in\r\n     the spring. You may then expect a full crop. It is best to\r\n     make a new bed once in two or three years.”\r\n\r\nBut plantations may be made through the summer, and as late as\r\nSeptember; of course, the earlier in the season the better established\r\nthe plants will become before winter, and the larger the next summer’s\r\ncrop. Thus, a bed formed in September would bear very scantily; while\r\nMr. Jackson’s beds, formed in the spring, produced a large crop the\r\nnext season.\r\n\r\nMr. Kenrick gives the following methods as practised by market\r\ngardeners near Boston; the first one strikes us as being the most\r\neconomical way of working strawberries, on a large scale, that we have\r\nseen:\r\n\r\n     “In the vicinity of Boston, the following mode is often\r\n     adopted. The vines are usually transplanted in August. The\r\n     rows are formed from eighteen inches to two feet asunder.\r\n     The runners, during the first year, are destroyed. In the\r\n     second year, they are suffered to grow and fill the\r\n     interval, and in the autumn of that year, the whole old rows\r\n     are turned under with the spade, and the rows are thus\r\n     shifted to the middle of the space. The same process is\r\n     repeated every second year.\r\n\r\n     “Another mode, which may be recommended generally, is to\r\n     plant the strawberries in rows thirty inches asunder, and\r\n     nine inches distant in the row, and suffer the vines to\r\n     extend to the width of eighteen inches, leaving twelve\r\n     inches’ space for an alley; or allow eighteen inches’ width\r\n     to the alleys, and three feet asunder to the rows; and to\r\n     form new beds every three years, or never to suffer the bed\r\n     to exist over four years; and to plant out in August in\r\n     preference to spring.”\r\n\r\nDr. Bayne of Alexandria, D. C., gives his method of producing very\r\nlarge fruit. The peculiarity of his treatment is the use of\r\nundecomposed or green manure. Almost every other cultivator recommends\r\n_well rotted_ manure; and, we are inclined to think, with the better\r\nreason. We have found some English cultivators who agree with him; but\r\nthe most dissuade from the practice, as making plants productive of\r\nleaves rather than fruit.\r\n\r\n     “To produce strawberries of extraordinary size for\r\n     exhibition, I would recommend the following preparation:\r\n     select the best soil and trench it at least two feet deep;\r\n     incorporate well with the first twelve inches an abundance\r\n     of strong undecomposed manure; pulverize and rake the ground\r\n     well, then mark off the rows twelve or fifteen inches\r\n     asunder, and set the plants in the rows from twelve to\r\n     fifteen inches, according to the luxuriance and vigor of the\r\n     variety. During the first year, the runners must be\r\n     carefully and frequently destroyed before they become\r\n     rooted. By this means the stools become very vigorous and\r\n     bear the most abundant crops. In the spring after the fruit\r\n     is set, place around each plant a small quantity of straw,\r\n     or what is much better, cover the whole surface of the\r\n     ground one inch thick with wheat chaff. This prevents\r\n     evaporation, protects the fruit from the earth, improves the\r\n     flavor, and will greatly increase the size.”\r\n\r\nLoudon gives Garnier’s method of treating the strawberry as an\r\n_annual_. It is peculiarly applicable to small gardens. The\r\nobservations on the depth of soil required, are worthy of especial\r\nattention:\r\n\r\n     “Early in August, or as soon as the gathering is over, I\r\n     destroy all my beds, and proceed immediately to trench,\r\n     form, and manure them in the manner before directed, to\r\n     receive the plants for the crop of the ensuing year, taking\r\n     care to select for that purpose the strongest and\r\n     best-rooted runners from the old rejected plants. If at this\r\n     season the weather should be particularly hot, and the\r\n     surface of the ground much parched, I defer the operation of\r\n     preparing my beds and planting them till the ground is\r\n     moistened by rain. Such is the simple mode of treatment\r\n     which I have adopted for three successive years, and I have\r\n     invariably obtained upon the same spot, a great produce of\r\n     beautiful fruit, superior to that of every other garden in\r\n     the neighborhood. Depth of soil I have found absolutely\r\n     necessary for the growth and production of fine\r\n     strawberries, and when this is not to be obtained, it is\r\n     useless, in my opinion, to plant many of the best varieties.\r\n     It is not generally known, but I have ascertained the fact,\r\n     that most strawberries generate roots, and strike them into\r\n     the ground, nearly two feet deep in the course of one\r\n     season. The practice of renewing strawberry plantations\r\n     every year, and even of using runners of the current year\r\n     for forcing, is now become very general among gardeners. Mr.\r\n     Knight generally adopts this mode, and, notwithstanding the\r\n     increased labor attending it, it is even adopted by some\r\n     market-gardeners about London for their earliest crops. It\r\n     is invariably found that by this mode the fruit not only\r\n     comes larger, but somewhat earlier. It must always be\r\n     recollected, however, by those who intend practising it,\r\n     that almost the whole of the success depends on bringing\r\n     forward the earliest runners, by encouraging them to root.\r\n     This is done by stirring the soil beneath them, hooking them\r\n     down, or retaining them in their proper places by small\r\n     stones; or, when the object is to procure plants for\r\n     forcing, rooting them into small pots.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRASPBERRIES, STRAWBERRIES, GOOSEBERRIES AND CURRANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrants, Gooseberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, etc., are termed\r\n“Small Fruit.” We will give some directions for spring-work which\r\nthese require.\r\n\r\nRASPBERRIES.—The sorts usually found in our gardens are rejected from\r\nall good collections as worthless. The Antwerp, red and white, have,\r\nuntil lately, been regarded as the best. Two new kinds are very highly\r\nthought of—the _Franconia_ and the _Fastolf_. This last is an English\r\nvariety; was found growing on a gentleman’s ground among some lime and\r\nbrick rubbish—evidently a seedling—and removed to his garden. It was a\r\nnumber of years before it attracted attention; but, lately, it has\r\nbeen much in demand and bids fair to claim a rank among the first, if\r\nit is not _the_ first.\r\n\r\nA deep, rich, loamy soil which is moist, proves best for this fruit.\r\nIt prefers a half shady position.\r\n\r\nWhen first planted, put them four feet apart in the row, and the rows\r\nthree feet from each other.\r\n\r\nIn old beds cut out the _last year’s bearing wood_, now worthless, and\r\nalso all the new shoots but four or five to a root; grub up all that\r\nhave come up between the rows. Cut those which are reserved for\r\nbearing to about five feet in length, and tie them gently to a stake.\r\nThus treated from year to year, and well manured, raspberries will\r\nreturn a rich reward.\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRIES.—The number of kinds is immense. Knight, late president\r\nof the London Horticultural Society, had _four hundred_ kinds in his\r\ngarden, and most of them seedlings of his own raising. The early\r\n_Virginia_ is regarded as the best early kind. Hovey’s, Warren’s and\r\nKeen’s seedlings are admirable sorts. Wiley’s and Motter’s seedlings\r\noriginated in Cincinnati and are esteemed. There are many other fine\r\nsorts which an amateur cultivator would wish, not necessary to common\r\ngardens, where two or three choice sorts will suffice.\r\n\r\nAlmost every cultivator has a way of his own in raising strawberries.\r\n\r\nIn private gardens, in a soil well enriched and deeply spaded, let\r\nbeds be formed about four feet wide; upon these set three rows of\r\nhills and the plants about fifteen inches apart in the row. _Pinch of\r\nall runners through the season_, unless they are wanted for new\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nOld beds, grown over and matted, had better be destroyed; but if, for\r\nany reason, it is desirable to save them, mark out lines every\r\neighteen inches and dig alleys through the bed, by turning the plants\r\nunder. In this way the patch will be thrown into beds of eighteen\r\ninches width. Before this is done take an iron-toothed rake and rake\r\nthe bed severely. Do not be afraid of tearing the plants; go over the\r\nwhole bed thoroughly. It will seem as if scarcely a dozen plants were\r\nleft, but in a few weeks your bed will be entirely covered with a\r\nstrong growth.\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRIES.—This fruit is very much neglected because its merits are\r\nonly little known. There are two sorts found in our gardens, the\r\ncommon gooseberry and _English_, by which name is meant a large,\r\ncoarse, thick-skinned green variety. It is not generally known that\r\nthere are any other cultivated sorts; and as these are inferior they\r\nare little cared for. The Lancashire (England) Nurserymen publish 300\r\nvarieties! The select list of Mr. Thompson of the London Horticultural\r\nSociety’s garden comprises _fifty-six_ varieties; the still more\r\ncondensed select list of _Robert Manning_ (Mass.) includes\r\n_twenty-eight_ sorts. Some of these bear fruit as large as a\r\nmedium-sized plum. There are four colors, red, yellow, green and\r\nwhite; to each color are two sizes, large and small fruits. Those who\r\nhave not seen and tasted the Scotch and Lancashire varieties of the\r\ngooseberry do not know what the fruit is. In sending for them, select\r\na _trustworthy_ nurseryman, and request him to send, of each color,\r\nsuch kinds as have proved, with him, the best; and in such numbers as\r\nyou may wish. The gooseberry delights in three things, a very rich\r\nsoil, a shady position, and a free circulation of air. If accommodated\r\nin these respects, it will be free from mildew and give a sure and\r\nample crop of delicious fruit.\r\n\r\nHill-tops are the best sites. In gardens the open and airy parts\r\nshould be selected; in low and confined situations they mildew. Hog\r\nmanure is esteemed the best for this fruit. When the fruit begins to\r\nset, if threatened with blight, take a moderately strong lime-water\r\n(sulphur added will be all the better) or, if lime is not convenient,\r\nlye from wood ashes, and drench the bushes freely with it. A large\r\nwatering-pot should be employed. Gooseberries may be increased from\r\ncuttings like the currant, and with the same ease.\r\n\r\nCURRANTS.—There are very few varieties of this fruit. Our common red\r\nand white, if well cultivated, are very good. The Large Dutch Red, and\r\nWhite, are much larger varieties and generally preferred in the best\r\nEastern gardens. Every farmer, if he has nothing else, has a long row\r\nof currant bushes, and gets, usually, five times as many currants as\r\nhe can consume. Very few fruits have so few diseases incident to them\r\nas the currant. It is not infested with worms, its fruit is subject to\r\nno blight, it bears every year, is rarely affected either by severe\r\nwinters or late frosts, and we do not remember a season in our lives\r\nwhen there was not, at least, a partial currant crop.\r\n\r\nWe advise those who are careful in such matters to train their\r\ncurrants to a _tree form_; let a cutting be set, rub out all the buds\r\nbut two or three at the top; at about twelve or fifteen inches from\r\nthe earth let the branches put out, and never permit suckers to grow,\r\nor branches to stand lower than this. The difficulty which some have\r\nfound in tree currants, that they are top-heavy and require staking to\r\nprevent their being bent by winds and their own weight, arises from\r\nhaving the stem too long. We have seen two feet and even more allowed.\r\nIf twelve or fifteen inches be allowed, the stem, in a few years, will\r\nbecome strong enough to withstand winds and sustain its own top. Thus\r\nformed they are beautiful to the eye, convenient for borders, allow a\r\nfree circulation of air under and through them, are easy to work in\r\nspring or for manuring, and easy to prune, when, as should be done\r\nevery year, you take out the old wood.\r\n\r\nGooseberries will do better to be trained in this way, than in the\r\nbush form. The top once formed, there is no difficulty in keeping it\r\nso. If you are faithful to grub up every sucker for one season you\r\nwill have few to plague you after that.\r\n\r\nGooseberries, Raspberries, Strawberries and Currants ought to be found\r\nin every farmer’s garden. The trouble of cultivation is slight and the\r\nreturn of wholesome fruit very great. One woman can, for the most\r\npart, bestow all the attention which they need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING WORK IN THE ORCHARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. There is a great deal more pruning done than is needful or\r\nhealthful. Our hot summers and strong growth of wood make every leaf\r\non the tree precious. Dead limbs should be taken out. Where the tree\r\nis really _tangled_ with wood, thin out. Where branches are rubbing\r\nacross each other _severely_, take off one of them. Grub up _every_\r\nwater-sprout from the roots. If you can avoid it, do not use them for\r\ntrees, for the tree thus obtained will inherit the same propensity of\r\nsending up water-shoots. Sometimes, in scarcity of stock, they are\r\nused rather than to have none, but it is then only a lesser of two\r\nevils.\r\n\r\n2. TIME OF PRUNING.—There is a bad practice abroad of pruning before\r\nthe leaves are out. English books direct to prune in February, and we\r\nsuspect that the custom sprang up at the East from the old country\r\nexample. It is not safe for us to follow the _specific_ processes of\r\nGreat Britain or the Continent. OUR OWN _well settled experience is to\r\nbe our rule of practice_.\r\n\r\nThere is no better month in the year to prune, _than that month in\r\nwhich the tree is making the most wood_. It is plain that the sooner a\r\nwound heals the better; and equally plain, that a tree which is\r\n_growing_ will heal a wound quicker than an inactive tree. All the\r\nmatter which goes to form wood, or to form the granulations by which a\r\ncut heals, comes from the _downward_ current of sap, or sap which has\r\nbeen elaborated in the leaf. Of course when the tree has the most\r\nleaves, and the leaves are preparing the greatest quantity of _proper\r\njuice_ or elaborated sap, that is the time for pruning, because the\r\ntime for healing. In this climate we have preferred the last of May\r\nfor spring pruning, and the last of August for summer pruning—the\r\nexact week varying as the season is forward or backward.\r\n\r\n3. INSTEAD OF PRUNING AT THIS EARLY PERIOD, LET TREES BE THOROUGHLY\r\nSCRAPED AND SCOURED.—A three-sided scraper, such as butchers use to\r\nclean their blocks with, or any convenient implement, may be applied\r\nto the trunk and large branches with force sufficient to take off the\r\n_dry, dead_ bark. Only this is to be removed. Take soft soap and\r\nreduce it by _urine_ to the consistence of paint. With a stiff\r\nshoe-brush rub the whole trunk and the limbs as far up as is\r\npracticable. The bark will grow smooth and glossy; insect eggs will be\r\nentirely destroyed; all moss and fungous vegetation removed, and the\r\nbark stimulated and made healthier. THIS IS BETTER THAN ANY WHITEWASH,\r\nand just as convenient.\r\n\r\n4. Lime is better used as follows: remove the earth from the trunk,\r\nand put about half a peck to each tree. Every spring, spread and dig\r\nin the old lime, and put new in its place. Unleached ashes are good to\r\nbe dug in around a tree. If your soil is calcareous, full of lime,\r\nthese applications are not needful. Thoroughly rotted manure, or\r\nbetter yet, black vegetable mold may be dug in liberally, and will\r\nsupply the soil with nutriment, and the roots will find their way in\r\nwith great facility.\r\n\r\n5. When a tree is manured, remember that the _ends_ only of the roots\r\ntake up nourishment, and that the ends of the roots are not found\r\nclose by the _trunk_. We often see heaps of manure piled about the\r\n_trunk_, and the ends of the roots are three yards or more distant\r\nfrom it. You might as well put your fodder down at your cattle’s hind\r\nlegs, and wonder that they did not get fat on it. Treat your trees as\r\nyou do your stock—put their food where their mouths are. YOUNG\r\nORCHARDS are better without stimulating manure. Let the soil be\r\nmellowed, and then give the trees their own time, and if they do not\r\nbear quite as soon, they will live longer and be less subject to\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRACLES IN FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a traveller was relating, in Cowper’s presence, some prodigious\r\nmarvels, the poet smiled somewhat incredulously. “Well, sir, don’t you\r\nbelieve me? I saw it with my own eyes.” “Oh, certainly, I believe it\r\nif _you_ saw it, but I would not if I had seen it _myself_.” Even so\r\nwe feel about the thousand and one physiological fooleries which run\r\nthe monthly rounds of the papers.\r\n\r\nHow on earth do men suppose a fruit to receive its characteristic\r\nquality? Is it from the root, trunk, pith, bark, branch, or leaf? One\r\nwould think that it made no difference which. We have long supposed\r\nthat the leaf digested the sap, returned it to the passages of\r\ndistribution to be employed in the formation of fruit, wood, tissue,\r\netc. Is this the function of the leaf? or have recent investigations\r\nexploded this doctrine? If not, it will be apparent that all grafting\r\nof scions together, cannot change the quality of fruit, unless the\r\nleaves are also amalgamated. Is a red, green, yellow, and white fruit,\r\nsweet, sour, or bitter, be put upon the same tree, each will maintain\r\nits characteristics; because, each bud or scion has its own peculiar\r\nleaves, from whose laboratory the fruit is sweetened or acidulated and\r\ncolored with all its hues. To be sure, fruits are affected by the\r\nstock on which they are put; but their characteristic elements are not\r\naltered, but only pushed along in the same line and made more perfect.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that trees indulge, occasionally, in rare antics. A\r\nsober apple-tree will sometimes let down its dignity, in what\r\ngardeners call a “sport,” _e. g._ a sweet apple may grow on a sour\r\ntree, and _vice versâ_. An apple may on one side be sweet and on the\r\nother sour. But, in such cases, the same general law is seen governing\r\nyet. We all know that great changes of temperament occur in men. A\r\nnervous temperament often becomes abdominal, and a little, wiry,\r\nfussy, peevish, minikin, becomes a round, plump, rosy, corpulent spot\r\nof good nature. Similar changes may occur, through disease, or the\r\npeculiarity of the season, or from unknown causes, in the structure of\r\nthe leaves of a branch, and then the fruit will follow the change of\r\nthe leaf.\r\n\r\nBut the fruit itself digests still further the elaborated sap sent to\r\nit from the leaf. If, then, from any hidden causes, the fruit should\r\nin part change its structure, the juices elaborated would be altered.\r\nIf stamens and pistils may change to petals, if petals may change to\r\nleaves, if leaves may extend to branches, we know of no reason why the\r\nwhole or the half of a fruit may not, also, alter its structure; and\r\nwith its peculiarity of function, also, of course, the character of\r\nthe fruit. While then we are not skeptical of “monsters,” “marvels,”\r\n“sports,” “singularities,” we think we can trace the original law\r\nthrough all the transmutations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTING THE ROOTS OF FRUIT-TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCultivators are frequently urged in Horticultural papers to _cover the\r\nroots_ of the peach-trees with heaps of snow, etc., that they may be\r\nretarded in the spring, and escape injury from late frosts upon their\r\nblossoms. This direction takes it for granted that the warmth of the\r\nground starts the root, and the root starts the sap, and the sap wakes\r\nup the dormant branch. By covering the soil and keeping it back, the\r\nwhole tree is supposed to be secured. But, unfortunately for this\r\nprocess, the motion of the sap is _first_ in the BRANCHES, and last in\r\nthe roots. Light and heat, exerted upon the branches for any\r\nconsiderable length of time, produce a high state of excitability; the\r\nsap begins to move toward the bud, its place is supplied by a portion\r\nlower down, and so on until the whole column of sap through the trunk\r\nis in motion, and last of all in the ROOT. But suppose warm, spring\r\ndays, with a temperature of from sixty degrees to sixty-five degrees,\r\nhave produced a vigorous motion of the sap in the branches and trunk,\r\nwhile the root, (thanks to snow and ice piled over it to keep it\r\nfrozen), is dormant, what will result? The sap already within the tree\r\nwill be exhausted, the root will supply none, the light and heat still\r\npush on the development of bud and leaf and the tree will exhaust\r\nitself and die. We not long since observed a remarkable confirmation\r\nof these reasonings. A gentleman of our acquaintance, in reading these\r\nunskilfull directions to cover the peach-tree root, opened trenches\r\nabout his trees, and filled them with snow, heaping bountifully also\r\nall about the trees. The next spring, long after his trees should have\r\nbeen at work, the snow held the root fast; the buds swelled and burst,\r\nlingered, shrivelled and died—and the _trees too_. This might have\r\nbeen prognosticated. There are partial methods of protecting the peach\r\nfrom too early development, but they all have respect to the\r\nprotection of the _limbs_. If the branches can be covered during the\r\nrandom and prematurely hot days of spring, the tree will not suffer.\r\nHigh, and cool-aired aspects, north hill-sides, northern sides of\r\nhouses, barns, etc., will answer this purpose. When it can be\r\nafforded, long boards may be set up upon the east and south sides of\r\nchoice trees, upon a frame slightly made and easily removed.\r\n\r\nThe reason why more damage has not been done by covering peach-tree\r\nroots, than has occurred, is, that the ground has been superficially\r\nfrozen, and many of the roots extending deeper and laterally beyond\r\nthe congealed portions, have afforded a supply of sap after a motion\r\nhad been imparted to it in the branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING GRAPE VINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll know that after the sap begins to flow in the spring, a vine, if\r\ncut, will bleed. It seems that at this early period of its development\r\nthe sap vessels have no power of contraction. Many suppose that the\r\nsame state of things continues throughout the growing season, and are\r\nafraid to cut their vines. But after the vine has begun to grow freely\r\n(when the leaves, for example, are as large as the palm of one’s\r\nhand), a wound very soon contracts, bleeds little or none, and heals\r\nover as in a tree. Any pruning which is necessary upon the old wound\r\nmay, therefore, be fearlessly performed.\r\n\r\nSome inexpert cultivators, in order to let the sun fall upon the\r\ngrapes, pluck off the leaves; hoping thus to procure sweeter grapes.\r\nThis is the very way to have acid fruit. Where is the sugar prepared\r\nfor the cluster but in these very leaves which are taken off? Without\r\nleaves, the sap which flows into the cluster has undergone but\r\nimperfectly those chemical changes on which the fruit depends. Every\r\nleaf in the neighborhood of the fruit is precious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILDEW ON GRAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany permit the fruit of the vines to perish before their eyes from\r\nthe ravages of mildew, ignorant that an effectual remedy is within\r\ntheir reach. It is simply to dust the branches with flowers of\r\nsulphur. It is best done while the dew is on.\r\n\r\nWhen vines are trained upon the sides of a house or fence, it is well\r\nto whitewash the surfaces on which they are fastened with a wash in\r\nwhich flowers of sulphur has been largely mixed.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended by some cultivators to employ such a whitewash for\r\nthe _wood_ of the vine, covering all the main stems with it; but all\r\nthese methods result in the one thing—the application of sulphur as a\r\nremedy for mildew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO OBTAIN GRAPE VINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting is only practised on the vine for special reasons, and we\r\nhave never had occasion to try it. We shall speak of a better mode of\r\nobtaining vines.\r\n\r\nThe best method of “getting a start” of grape vines is, by the\r\nemployment of cuttings. These may be planted immediately after the\r\nspring pruning of established vines. But cuttings of native grapes are\r\nas well planted _in the fall_. The granulation, from which the roots\r\nspring, will form during the winter, and the cuttings, starting early\r\nin the spring, will make good growth the first year. Cuttings are the\r\nbest, because they can be procured easily, abundantly, and cheaply;\r\nthey will bear carriage to any distance, are exceedingly tenacious of\r\nlife, and they make thriftier plants. Cuttings may be set, either\r\nwhere they are to remain, in which case several should be set, to\r\nallow for failures, and only the strongest finally retained; or, they\r\nmay be set in nursery rows, eight inches apart. Cuttings should be\r\ninserted about eight inches deep, and have two eyes or buds above the\r\nsurface. The _two_ buds are merely precautionary; that if one fails\r\nthe other may sprout; one only, and that the strongest, should finally\r\nbe permitted to grow.\r\n\r\nAn old and skillful cultivator of the vine says that _cuttings are the\r\nbest of all modes of_ securing a supply of vines. “For my part I am\r\nfor scions without roots, after many experiments. All the advantage\r\nthe one with roots has over the other, is that they are more sure to\r\nlive; but they will not in general, _make as thrifty plants_.”—_J. J.\r\nDufour._\r\n\r\nThis only objection to cuttings—that a part of them fail to root—is of\r\nlittle practical importance, as they are easily obtained in any\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMNAL MANAGEMENT OF FRUIT-TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrchardists and cultivators of garden-fruit will have need of all\r\ntheir skill to prepare tender fruit-trees for winter. It is the\r\nmisfortune, alike of the English summers, and of ours in the West,\r\nthat trees do not properly ripen their wood. But in Great Britain it\r\nis from the want of enough, and in America, from too much summer. Our\r\nlong and hot summers give two or three _separate growths_ to\r\nfruit-trees, and the last one is usually in progress at a period so\r\nlate that severe frosts and freezings overtake the tree while yet in\r\nan excitable state, pushing new wood, and with a top quite unripened\r\nfor severe frosty handling.\r\n\r\nThe year 1845 furnished a fine type of western summers. The spring\r\ncame in very properly, and at so late a period that the usual frosts,\r\nafter the expansion of leaves, were avoided. The summer opened warmly\r\nand continued with almost unvarying heat throughout. At the same time\r\nthere were frequent and copious rains.\r\n\r\nBy this statement the average temperature of June was 71°, and the\r\nrain 6-1/ , inches; of July, average noon heat 80°, rain 3¼ inches; of\r\nAugust, average noon heat 80°, rain 5½ inches. Nights were exceedingly\r\nwarm. The day repeatedly opened and closed at 80°. Our thermometer on\r\nthe north of our house, in a shady yard, stood for eight and ten days\r\ntogether between 94° and 100°, twice attaining the latter height.\r\n\r\nUnder such stimulus our pear, apple and plum-trees, made their first\r\ngrowth by the first of July. They soon started into a second growth,\r\nwhich wound up during the last of August and the first of September,\r\nplum-trees entirely shedding their leaves and standing as bare as in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nLet orchards be examined when frosts begin to occur, and every\r\n_side-shoot_, _sucker_ or _water-sprout_, cut cleanly out. These\r\nsucculent, raw sprouts are the breeding-spots of disease. Cold-blight\r\ninvariably manifests itself in them in the most positive form..\r\n\r\nGarden trees, choice pears, and stone-fruits, should, in addition to\r\nthis operation, if still in growth at the last of September, receive a\r\nfall pruning. From the first to the middle of October, according to\r\nthe season, cut off two-thirds of the new growth, or back to strong,\r\nripe wood. It is well known that the newest buds, near the extremity\r\nof young wood, are the most sensitive and apt to break and grow,\r\nwhereas the buds near the base of a branch are dormant. It is the\r\nrepose of the older buds which makes fall pruning, if performed with\r\njudgment, so valuable. Because it forces the tree to expend its\r\nenergies in ripening its wood instead of making more, and it also\r\ntends to induce fruitfulness by changing leaf-buds to fruit-buds. The\r\ngreat art of fall pruning is to relieve the tree of its crude wood\r\n_without causing its dormant buds to break_. If performed too early,\r\nor if but the tips of the fine wood are removed, the new buds may\r\nbreak and side-shoots issue, leaving the tree worse off than before.\r\n\r\nYoung trees _just coming into bearing_ should have their trunks\r\nprotected. That there is a change in the economy of a tree when it\r\nbegins to bear is plain; and experience seems to teach that trees are\r\npeculiarly tender at the time of this change, since they are far more\r\napt to die when coming to fruit, than either before or afterward.\r\nCherry-trees and pear-trees should have brush, or corn-stalks, or\r\nstraw, or matting, as is most convenient, so placed from the ground to\r\nthe branches, as to exclude the sun without excluding air. An hour’s\r\nattention may save much regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARS GRAFTED UPON THE APPLE STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not think the pear does so well in any other way as on its own\r\nroot. But it has been found extremely difficult to obtain the\r\nrequisite stock. Pear-seeds are scarce. When obtained, the seedlings\r\nhave proved intractable, and left the nurseryman oftentimes in the\r\nlurch. The first and best substitute for pear-stock, is the _root of\r\nthe pear_—great quantities may be obtained when removing pear-trees in\r\nthe autumn from the nursery, and also without any injury to the trees,\r\nroots may be taken from old bearing-trees. These are to be grafted in\r\nthe manner already described in our pages. Next to this, the quince\r\nstock is to be chosen. The pear is dwarfed upon it. In other words,\r\nthe two are but imperfectly suited to each other, and the scion does\r\nnot develop according to its original nature. But this very dwarfing\r\nadds something to the good qualities of the fruit, affords trees so\r\nsmall that, at eight feet apart, they make beautiful linings to a walk\r\nor border, and, morever, brings the pear to its fruit several years\r\nearlier than if it were on its own bottom. But on the other hand, the\r\npear on quince is comparatively short-lived. The white-thorn has been\r\ntried as a stock and not without success, but it is hardly to be used\r\nexcept in extremities.\r\n\r\nLast, and worst of all, comes the apple. The scion grows as vigorously\r\nupon the apple as upon a stock of its own species, and we do not know\r\nthat the fruit deteriorates. But the trees seem to _have no\r\nconstitution_. After a few bearings they seem struck with irremediable\r\nweakness, and soon run down and die. Nurserymen ought not, therefore,\r\nto graft the pear upon the apple. To do so, if advised of the\r\nforegoing facts, cannot be honest. Our attention has been called to\r\nthe subject by some painful experience of our own.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNESHANOC POTATO.—This potato (pronounced _Me_shanoc), was raised from\r\nthe seed about the year 1800, by John Gilkey, Mercer county,\r\nPennsylvania. He called it _Neshanoc_, from a creek near to which he\r\nlived. It was called by some, _Mercer_, from the county in which it\r\nwas raised. It is extensively cultivated, and deserves to be. Mr.\r\nGilkey was an Irishman—of course a judge of good potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDLINGS FROM BUDDED PEACHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Nicholas Longworth inquires: “Will the pit of the budded peach\r\nproduce the same fruit as the bud, or as the stock, or a mixture of\r\nthe two?” And he also says, “I have never fairly tested the question,\r\nbut my experience led me to believe that the budded pit produced the\r\nsame fruit as the original stock.”\r\n\r\nSo far as this question can be determined (independently of\r\nexperiment) upon the known laws of the vegetable kingdom, we say that\r\nit will _not_ produce fruit like that of the original stock; nor will\r\nit, on the other hand, with any certainty, reproduce the budded kind.\r\n\r\nIf the pit of a budded variety takes after the _stock_, we must very\r\nmuch change our theory of the office of leaves, and perhaps of the\r\nbark. At present, the received and orthodox teaching is, that the sap\r\nfrom the root is crude and undigested until it has received in the\r\nleaf a chemical change. Until then, the sap does not materially\r\ninfluence the vegetable tissue, nor form new substance, or affect the\r\nfruit. But _after_ its elaboration in the leaf, a returning current of\r\nprepared sap (similar in its functions to arterial blood), sets\r\ndownward, distributing to every part of the vegetable economy the\r\nproperties required by each. The sap arising from the root, does not\r\ntouch the channel of fruit until it has been chemically changed; and\r\nthe difference exhibited in the fruit of one tree compared with\r\nanother, arises, primarily from the nature of the sap which it\r\nreceives; the sap receives its qualities by a digestion in the\r\nleaf.[15] In all cases, then, we suppose the _leaf_ to determine the\r\nnature of the fruit (and the root in no case, and the trunk in no\r\ncase), since the stem is, so far as sap is concerned, but a bundle of\r\ncanals for its passage—a mere highway for transmission—and not like\r\nthe leaf, a laboratory for its preparation![16]\r\n\r\nWe may be reminded that a _stock_, in point of fact, _does_ influence\r\nthe fruit. It is indisputable that pears are changed on quince roots.\r\nThe _Wilkinson_, grafted upon the quince, is smaller, more prolific,\r\nhigher flavored, and of a brighter red cheek than if grafted on the\r\npear. The Duchesse d’Angoulême is larger and better on the quince than\r\non its own roots. But what is _the_ influence in this case? When a\r\nfree-grower is put upon a slow-grower, the point of junction becomes a\r\npoint of comparative _obstruction_ to the return-sap. It is only a\r\nwholesome process of _ringing, or decortication_. Lindley says:\r\n\r\n“When pears are worked upon the wild species, apples upon crabs, and\r\npeaches upon peaches, the scion is, in regard to fertility, exactly in\r\nthe same state as if it had not been grafted at all: while, on the\r\nother hand, a great increase of fertility, is the result of grafting\r\npears upon quinces, peaches upon plums, apples upon the thorn, and the\r\nlike. In these cases, the food absorbed from the earth by the root of\r\nthe stock is communicated slowly.” And Manning adds: “No other\r\ninfluence have we ever noticed exercised by the scion upon the stock.”\r\n\r\nBut if, after all, it can be shown by actual trial, that the pits of\r\nbudded peaches DO _go back to the fruit of the stock_, why we must\r\nreceive it, in spite of all theory; for, (and some would do well to\r\nheed the maxim), facts must rule our theories, and not theories our\r\nfact. But we may properly put any facts seeming to contravene the\r\nreceived theory of the functions of plants in producing fruit, _upon\r\ntheir oath_, and refuse them, unless they are unquestionable and\r\nrelevant.\r\n\r\nSuppose a budded peach not to yield a fruit at all like the bud,\r\nsuppose it to resemble the fruit of the stock, it does not follow that\r\nthe _stock_ influenced the fruit to such a change. Mr. Longworth knows\r\nhow freely some peaches “sport,” and that all peaches may be made to\r\ndo it. If a Melacatune be budded upon a Red Rareripe, and the\r\nMelacatune pit shows a fruit resembling the Red Rareripe, it must be\r\nshown that the blossom had not been crossed by the busy offices of\r\nflies, bees, etc., with the pollen of contiguous Red Rareripe-trees.\r\n\r\nWhen a tree is even _solitary_, it does not follow that a change in\r\nfruit which shall make it resemble the stock more than the graft,\r\nresults from the force _of the stock_ on the grafted fruit, for\r\nseedlings of grafted fruit are, notoriously often, base and\r\ndegenerate; and the resemblance might be accidental, for seedlings of\r\ndifferent origin are often strikingly alike.\r\n\r\nWhile we are aware of no facts which justify Mr. Longworth’s\r\nsuspicion, that the pits of budded varieties produce kinds like the\r\nstock on which the bud was put, we have facts enough showing that\r\n“budded pits” produce their own kind.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that _thoroughly_ ripe peaches are less inclined to\r\n“sport” than those which are partially green.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [15] The fruit itself still further elaborates the sap, else\r\n     a peach would be as acrid as the juice of the peach leaf.\r\n\r\n     [16] Loudon (Encyclopædia of Gardening, p. 448), has the\r\n     following remarks:\r\n\r\n     “The bark is the medium in which the proper juices of the\r\n     plant, in their descent from the leaves, are finally\r\n     elaborated and brought to the state which is peculiar to the\r\n     species. From the bark these juices are communicated to the\r\n     medullary rays, to be by them deposited in the tissue of the\r\n     wood. The character of timber, therefore, depends chiefly\r\n     upon the influence of the bark: and hence, it is that the\r\n     wood formed above a graft never partakes, in the slightest\r\n     degree, of the nature of the wood below it. The bark, when\r\n     young and green, like the leaves, is supposed, like them, to\r\n     elaborate the sap, and hence may be considered as the\r\n     universal leaf of a plant.”\r\n\r\n     These views corroborate the reasoning above, although Loudon\r\n     extends the functions of the leaf to the _bark_. We have not\r\n     been able, in our limited range of books, to find any other\r\n     authority for this statement, respecting the “young and\r\n     green bark.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF PEACH-TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a light hoe and remove the earth from the trunk of your trees. If\r\nthere are worms there you may detect them from the gum which has\r\nexuded, or by the channels which they have made in the bark, or if by\r\nneither of these, by the discoloration of the bark in spots. Scrape\r\nthe bark gently with the back of a knife, and you can easily detect\r\nthe traces of worms if any are there. Cut freely and boldly both ways\r\nalong their track so as to lay bare the channel in its whole\r\nlength—remove the worm, and the bark will very soon heal. Sometimes\r\nfour, six, and even more will be found in one tree. The ashes of stone\r\ncoal, blacksmiths’ cinders, wood ashes, lime, the refuse stems of\r\ntobacco, planting tansy around the trunk, these, and dozens of other\r\nremedies are proposed. For our own part we rely solely on our\r\njack-knife. In March or April, and then again in August or September,\r\naccording to the season, we search the trunk thoroughly. We can attend\r\nto twenty trees in an hour or two; and when eating freely of delicious\r\npeaches we never had a qualm of regret for having so spent the time.\r\n\r\nWe have practised sowing salt under fruit-trees with decided\r\nadvantage. If one pound of saltpetre be added to every six pounds of\r\nsalt, it will be yet better. We sow enough to make the ground look\r\nmoderately white, and prefer to do it in wet weather.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe most salable butter, quality being equal, is that which is neatest\r\ndone up. There is a great deal in the _looks_ of a thing. You’ll\r\nalways find it so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRENOVATING PEACH-TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peach-tree inclines to thicken at the top, the small inside\r\nbranches die, and are removed by every neat cultivator. As the\r\nbranches shoot up, this tree is disposed to abandon its lower\r\nbranches, and, like the vine, to bear on the wood the farthest from\r\nthe root, _i. e._ the young and new wood. In a few years the tree has\r\na long-necked trunk, sometimes several of them; while the weight of\r\nfoliage and fruit is situated so as to act like a power applied to a\r\nlever; and as the fruit grows heavy, or a storm occurs, the tree is\r\nbroken down. We have practised the following method with success. In\r\nthe month of July we saw off the top of one half of the tree, leaving\r\nabout ten or twelve feet of stem, measuring from the ground. New\r\nshoots will now put out along the whole trunk; a part of these should\r\nbe rubbed off, according to the judgment of the cultivator, leaving\r\nsuch as will give symmetry to the tree, _and form a head low down_.\r\nThe second year, these branches will bear fruit, and the other side\r\nmay then be treated in the same way.\r\n\r\nThis new head will require little meddling with for about four years.\r\nAt this time, or whenever the tree is outrunning itself, the same\r\nprocess is to be renewed. But this time the tree will be composed of a\r\nmultitude of smaller branches, instead of two or three main ones as at\r\nfirst. Some of these should be wholly cut out, and the wound smeared\r\nwith a residuum of paint, or a thick white paint, or grafting wax, or\r\nanything that will exclude the air while the cut is granulating. The\r\nothers are to be cut within, say, five inches of the old, original\r\nwood—leaving, thus, a stem of mere stumps. If the branches are taken\r\nentirely off, leaving only the oldest wood, the buds which would break\r\nfrom it would not be as healthy or vigorous as those which will spring\r\nfrom the stumps of the later branches.\r\n\r\nProbably twenty or thirty whips will come to each stump; these should\r\nfrom day to day be reduced in number, until, at last, all are removed\r\nbut one, and that one should, if possible, spring from the nearest\r\npoint where the stump joins the old stem. When this new branch is\r\nobtained and fairly established, remove the stump with a fine saw, so\r\nas to leave the new branch, as nearly as possible, in the place of the\r\nold one. We remove the whips from a stump gradually in order to give\r\nthe tree the advantage of their leaves as long as it can be done\r\nwithout interfering with the branch or branches which we are training\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThis method is to the peach what pruning is to the grape. The tree is\r\nkept in hand instead of sprawling abroad, a prey to its own weight and\r\nto storms; there is always a plenty of young wood for the fruit, which\r\ncan be easily reached when one thins out, or gathers for use.\r\n\r\nOne of our trees taught us this method of its own accord in the summer\r\nof 1843. The weight of fruit was so great that we applied a prop to\r\nthe middle of the branch; in a few days the branch broke short off at\r\nthe point of the prop. It so happened that the three main limbs on one\r\nside of the tree acted in this manner. That same fall a strong growth\r\nof new wood shot out, and the next season I had on _that side_ as fine\r\na top as ever I had on any peach-tree.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nEvery farmer who expects his wife to make good butter, after\r\nfurnishing her with some good, well-fed milk cows, should provide her\r\nwith good milk-pans—large and shallow, so as to present a large\r\nsurface for the cream to rise on, and enough of them to hold all her\r\nmilk, and allow it to remain undisturbed long enough for all the cream\r\nto rise. These pans should be nicely washed every time the milk is\r\nemptied out of them, and always be clear and bright when filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APOLOGUE OR APPLE-LOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo men planted out each one hundred apple-trees. In six or seven\r\nyears they began to bear. One had spared no pains to bring his orchard\r\ninto the highest condition. He had constantly cultivated the soil\r\nabout them, scraped off the rough bark, washed them with urinated\r\nsoap, picked off every worm and nursed them as if they had been\r\nchildren. The other, pursuing a cheaper plan, simply let his trees\r\nalone; but the moss, and canker-worms took his place and attended to\r\nthem every year. When the orchards began to bear, the careful man had\r\nthe best fruit, and the careless man covered his folly by cursing the\r\nnursery-man for selling him poor trees. In a year or two the careful\r\nman had two bushels to the other’s one from each tree. Not to be\r\noutdone, the latter determined to have as many apples as the former,\r\nand set out another hundred trees. By and by, when they bore, the\r\nother orchard had so improved that it produced twice as many yet;\r\nanother hundred trees were therefore planted. In process of time the\r\nfirst orchard of one hundred trees still sent more fruit to market\r\nthan the three hundred trees of the careless man, who now gave up and\r\ndeclared that he never did have luck, and it was of no use to try _on\r\nhis soil_ to raise good fruit.\r\n\r\n1. When a man is too shiftless to take good care of two horses, he\r\nbuys two more, and gets from the four what he might get from two.\r\n\r\n2. A farmer who picks up a cow simply because it is not an ox, and\r\n_is_, nominally, lactiferous, and then lets the creature work for a\r\nliving, very soon buys a second, and a third, and a fourth, and gets\r\nfrom them all, what he should have had from one good one.\r\n\r\n3. A farmer had one hundred acres. Instead of getting seventy-five\r\nbushels of corn to the acre, he gets forty and makes it up by\r\ncultivating twice as many acres; instead of thirty bushes of wheat he\r\ngets twelve, and puts in acres enough to make up; instead of making\r\none hundred acres do the work of three hundred, he buys more land, and\r\nallows three hundred to do only the work of one hundred.\r\n\r\n4. A young woman, with a little pains, can have three times as many\r\nclothes as she needs, and then not look so well as a humble neighbor\r\nwho has not half her wardrobe; wherefore, we close with some proverbs\r\nmade for the occasion:\r\n\r\nActive little is better than lazy much.\r\n\r\nCarefulness is richer than abundance.\r\n\r\nLarge farming is not always good farming, and small farming is often\r\nthe largest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT LIST OF APPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to frame a list of apples which will suit every\r\ncultivator. Men’s taste in fruits is widely different. The delicacy\r\nand mildness of flavor which some admire, is to others mere\r\ninsipidity. The sharp acid, and coarse grain and strong flavor which\r\ndisgust many palates, are with others the very marks of a first-rate\r\napple. The object of the cultivator in planting an orchard, whether\r\nfor his own use, for a home market, for exportation, for cider-making,\r\nor for stock-feeding, will very materially vary his selection.\r\n\r\nThe soil on which an orchard is to be planted should also determine\r\nthe use of many varieties, which are admirable only when well suited\r\nin their locality.\r\n\r\nRegard is to be had to climate, since some of the finest fruits in one\r\nlatitude entirely betray our expectations in another. The hardiness\r\nand health of different varieties ought to be more an object of\r\nattention than hitherto. As in building, so in planting an orchard, a\r\nmistake lasts for a century, and a bad tree in a good orchard is like\r\nbad timber in good mansion.\r\n\r\nHowever select, then, a list may be, every cultivator must exercise\r\nhis own judgment in adapting it to his own circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER APPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CAROLINA JUNE.—This is identical with the Red June of the principal\r\nnurseries; but many inferior varieties scattered through the country,\r\ncalled Red June, are to be discriminated from it.\r\n\r\nThe tree is upright with slender wood, which, when loaded with fruit,\r\ndroops like a willow. It is a healthy tree, ripens its wood early in\r\nthe fall, and is not subject to frost-blight. It comes early into\r\nbearing, is productive and bears every year. The fruit is of medium\r\nsize though specimens grow large; the flavor is sprightly, subacid,\r\nthe flesh tender. It has flourished well on sand-loams, common clays,\r\nand on strong limestone clay. Ripens from the first to the twentieth\r\nof July. A valuable market fruit. Four trees, in one county, sent\r\n_eighty dollars_’ worth to market in one season. Not mentioned by\r\neastern writers, nor found in eastern catalogues, but described at the\r\nWest by Hampton and Plummer, and found in Ohio and Indiana nurseries.\r\n\r\n2. SWEET JUNE.—Tree upright, wood moderately strong; ripens its wood\r\nearly in fall; not subject to frost-blight; flourishes on all soils,\r\neven if quite wet; bears very young, often while in nursery rows;\r\nbears every year and abundantly. The fruit is of medium size; color a\r\npale yellow; form globular; flavor sweet and pleasant. Ripens at same\r\ntime as the Carolina June.\r\n\r\n3. KIRKBRIDGE WHITE.—Not found in any catalogues but those of Western\r\nnurseries. Tree upright, wood strong and stubbed; grows slow while\r\nyoung, but vigorously when fully established; ripens its wood early in\r\nautumn; not subject to frost-blight; bears moderately young, and is\r\nvery productive. _Its fruit ripens in succession for six weeks from\r\nfirst of July to middle of August_, and is peculiarly valuable on that\r\naccount; color nearly white; it is largest at base and tapers\r\nregularly to the eye, and is ribbed; flavor, mild, pleasant acid;\r\nflesh melting, and, if fully ripe breaks to pieces in falling to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n4. PRINCE’S HARVEST.—Manning pronounces this “the earliest apple\r\nworthy of cultivation.” It may be in Massachusetts, but it is preceded\r\nby many at the West. Manning’s description is good.\r\n\r\n     “The form is flat, of medium size; the skin, when perfectly\r\n     ripe, is of a beautifully bright straw color; the flesh\r\n     tender and sprightly; if gathered before they are fully\r\n     ripe, it has too much acidity. The finest fruits are those\r\n     which drop ripe from the tree; the branches make very acute\r\n     angles, by which it is readily distinguished from most other\r\n     trees in the orchard; it bears young. Ripe early in July.”\r\n\r\nOur nurserymen regard it as a shy bearer.\r\n\r\n5. SUMMER QUEEN.—Extensively cultivated in the West under the name of\r\n_Orange Apple_. The tree is spreading; a rapid grower; not subject to\r\nfrost-blight; wood moderately strong; comes late into bearing;\r\nproductive when the tree is fully grown, according to the books, but\r\nin this region with some exceptions has proved to be a poor bearer.\r\nFruit large, yellow, striped with red; flesh, breaking; flavor strong,\r\nand not delicate.\r\n\r\n6. SWEET BOUGH.—Two varieties of this name are cultivated in the\r\nWest—Coxe’s and Mount’s. Coxe’s sweet bough, is that of the books and\r\ncatalogues. Ripens at the same time; not quite so high in flavor.\r\nCoxe’s trees are large limbed and spreading; bearing on the point of\r\nthe limbs, and are shy bearers; Mount’s variety is of upright growth;\r\nbears on spurs along the branches; is a good bearer and ripens from\r\nmiddle of July to August.\r\n\r\n     “A variety under the name of Philadelphia Jennetting is\r\n     known in Trumbull County, Ohio. It ripens two weeks later\r\n     than the common kind, otherwise it is not essentially\r\n     different.”—_Dr. J. P. Kirtland._\r\n\r\n7. SUMMER PEARMAIN.—There seem to be two varieties of this name\r\ncultivated in Ohio and Indiana.\r\n\r\n(1.) That of Coxe, which is the one generally cultivated, and\r\ndeservedly popular.\r\n\r\n“The fruit-buds seem to be unusually hardy, and often resist the\r\nimpression of late spring frosts, while others are killed. In 1834,\r\nwhen our fruits were universally cut off by that destructive agent, a\r\ntree of the summer pearmain and another of the Vandeveer, matured a\r\ndozen or two apples, while not another tree in an orchard containing\r\nover five hundred, bore a solitary fruit. It is worthy of more\r\nextensive cultivation.”—_Dr. Kirtland._\r\n\r\n(2.) A variety evidently allied to Coxe’s, but all things considered a\r\nmore desirable variety. The fruit resembles Coxe’s, but is larger; the\r\nflavor is the same, but not quite as high; Coxe’s is oblong; this\r\nvariety is Vandeveer pippin shape; color the same, and the period of\r\nripening, viz., July and August. The trees are very distinct; Coxe’s\r\nis upright, this is spreading; Coxe’s of a slender growth, and stinted\r\nhabit, and is hard to bring forward in the nursery; this has a\r\nvigorous growth, and strong wood, and strikingly resembles the\r\nVandeveer pippin-tree. It bears early and abundantly in all soils.\r\n\r\nThis second variety was brought, by a man named Harlan, Fayette\r\nCounty, Indiana, from South Carolina, where it is extensively\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n8. DANIEL.—The tree is upright, nearly pear-tree shape; wood strong\r\nand healthy; leaves, above all varieties, dark green and glossy; bears\r\nyoung and abundantly. Fruit medium size; it has a yellow ground\r\ncovered with blotches of dull red; flavor rich, sweetish, and high.\r\nRipens in succession from first to middle of August. A desirable\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n9. HOSS, improperly pronounced _Horse_, and so written in Prince’s\r\ncatalogue. Originated in North Carolina; largely cultivated in both\r\nCarolinas and southern Virginia; named from the originator. It has\r\nbeen propagated by suckers, grafts, and _even by seeds_; in this\r\nlatter case, the product very nearly resembles the parent. Three\r\nvarieties, however, may be discriminated. Tree upright, wood strong\r\nand healthy; bears yearly and abundantly; flesh melting: flavor rather\r\ntoo acid until thoroughly ripe, and then fine. Ripens in August and\r\nSeptember. Desirable in the most select orchards.\r\n\r\nThe _time of ripening_ I have set down for the latitude of\r\nIndianapolis. Upon the Ohio River, near Cincinnati, it will be ten\r\ndays earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN APPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. MAIDEN’S BLUSH.—Tree moderately spreading, open top, limbs\r\nslender; grows late in fall, and somewhat liable to winter-killing;\r\ngrows well on all good soils; bears young and very abundantly every\r\nyear. The fruit large when the tree is not allowed to ripen too large\r\na crop; white, and blush toward the sun; tender, melting, very juicy,\r\ndecidedly acid. The fruit is, even in unfavorable seasons, very free\r\nfrom cracks, knots, and is always fair; one of the best for drying and\r\nexcellent for marketing; should be plucked before it is dead ripe;\r\nripens from August to October. It is the same as the English\r\nHorthornden. It does not do well grafted on the root; being apt to\r\nburst the first or second winter; buds well, and should be thus\r\npropagated in the nursery. It is a native of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n11. WINE APPLE.—Tree spreading but not sprawling; medium grower,\r\nhealthy; limbs rather slender; does well on all soils; bears very\r\nyoung, largely, and every year. Fruit large on young, and medium-sized\r\non old trees; deep yellow ground covered with red, and russet about\r\nthe stem; tender, melting, very juicy, high-flavored, sweet, with a\r\nspicy dash of subacid. One of the richest cooking apples; one of the\r\nmost desirable for drying, resembling dried pears. Where known, it is\r\nworth, dried, a dollar and a half a bushel, when other apples command\r\nbut seventy-five cents. Ripens first of September and has passed its\r\nprime by November. Eastern writers call it a winter apple, and Kenrick\r\ngives October to March as its season; but, in the West, it seldom sees\r\nthe first winter month. Takes by graft and bud pretty well; does well\r\ngrafted upon the root; favorable for nursery purposes.\r\n\r\n12. HOLLAND PIPPIN.—Tree large and spreading; strong growth; wood\r\nshort and stubbed, healthy; bears moderately young; they are averse to\r\nheavy clay and wet soils; on light, dry, rich, sandy soils bears\r\nlargely, and of high color and flavor; bears every other year. Fruit\r\nlarge, very bright yellow, tender, juicy, subacid. The pulp in the\r\nmouth becomes rather viscid, as if the fruit were mucilaginous, which\r\nis agreeable or otherwise according to the taste of the eater. It is\r\nsometimes, but rarely, water-cored. Ripens in October and November;\r\nwill keep later, but apt to lose in flavor. Good for drying, but\r\nusually sold green, being a very marketable fruit. Not a good tree for\r\nnurserymen; not willing to come if grafted on the root; does well by\r\ncrown-grafting; moderately well by budding, the eye being apt to put\r\nout simply a spur, which can seldom be forced into a branch if\r\npermitted to harden.\r\n\r\n13. RAMBO.—This apple is known in New Jersey by the names of Romanite,\r\nSeek-no-further, and Bread and Cheese. The first two names belong to\r\nentirely different apples. The rambo is not to be confounded with the\r\n_Rambours_, of which there are several varieties. Tree upright, and\r\nthe most vigorous growth of all trees cultivated in the West; the\r\neasiest of all to bud with, a bud seldom misses, and makes\r\nextraordinary growth the first season; it may well be called the\r\nnurseryman’s favorite; bears very young, abundantly every year, good\r\non all soils. Fruit medium size, yellow ground with red stripes and\r\nthe whole overlaid with a bloom, like a plum; tender, juicy, melting,\r\nsubacid, rich; it has a peculiarity of ripening; it begins at the skin\r\nand ripens toward the core; often soft and seemingly ripe on the\r\noutside while the inside is yet hard. Ripens from October to December.\r\nOne of the best of all fruits.\r\n\r\n14. GOLDEN RUSSET.—This admirable apple is put in the list of fall\r\nfruits, because, though it will keep through the winter, it ripens in\r\nNovember, and sometimes even in October. Tree, strong grower, upright,\r\ncompact top-healthy, grows late in fall and therefore subject to\r\nwinter-killing; will grow on all soils, but delights in rich sandy\r\nloams, on which it bears larger and finer fruit. Fruit small, rather\r\noblong; color yellow, slight red next to the sun; although called\r\n_russet_, there is but a _trace_ of it on the fruit of healthy trees;\r\ntender, melting, spicy, very juicy; in flavor it resembles the St.\r\nMichael’s _pear_ (Doyenné) more nearly than any other apple.\r\n\r\nThis fruit is the most popular of all late, fall, or early winter\r\napples, and deservedly, and should be put at the head of the list. A\r\ngentleman near Belfre, Ohio, being applied to for a list of apples to\r\nfurnish an orchard of a thousand trees for marketing purposes,\r\nreplied, “Take nine hundred and ninety-nine golden russets, and the\r\n_rest_ you can choose to suit yourself.” For nursery purposes it is\r\nrather a backward apple; the buds apt to fail, which occasions much\r\nresetting. It will not do well grafted on the root, being tender and\r\nalways largely winter-killed when so wrought. They graft kindly on\r\nwell established stocks.\r\n\r\nIf a larger list of fall apples is desired, we recommend the Fall\r\nHarvey, Gravenstein, Lyscom, Porter, Red Ingestrie, Yellow do. The\r\nAshmore is a desirable fruit—difficult to raise in the nursery, and\r\ntherefore avoided, but the fruit is fine. The Ross Nonpareil is a very\r\nadmirable fall fruit of Irish origin.\r\n\r\nThe list of autumn apples is very large and continually augmenting.\r\nBut fall apples are, ordinarily, less desirable than any others; not\r\nfrom inferior quality, but because they ripen at the season of the\r\nyear when peaches and pears are in their glory.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER APPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. GLORIA MUNDI or _Monstrous Pippin_. Tree, one of the most upright,\r\ntop close, and resembling the pear. Wood medium sized, healthy,\r\nvigorous growth, wood ripens early, not subject to frost-blight; bears\r\non moderately young trees. It works well from the bud, and also\r\nextremely well grafted on roots, and grows straight and finely for\r\nnursery purposes. Fruit very large, green, changes when dead-ripe to a\r\nyellowish white. Flavor mild, subacid; flesh melting and spicy. Ripens\r\nin November, at the same time with the Golden Russet, but will not\r\nkeep as long. A native.\r\n\r\n16. BLACK APPLE.—Tree low, spreading, and round topped; wood of medium\r\nvigor, healthy, ripens early, and not subject to frost-blight. Grafts\r\non the root kindly; not so favorable for budding as the No. 15; bears\r\nremarkably young, and abundantly to a fault. Fruit medium sized; color\r\nvery dark red, almost black, with grey rusty spots about the stem;\r\nflesh tender, breaking; moderately juicy, flavor rather sweet, though\r\nnot a real sweet apple. No apple would stand fairer as an early winter\r\nfruit, were it not for a peculiar, dry, raw taste, somewhat resembling\r\nthe taste of uncooked corn meal. Ripens from November to January. It\r\nis a native.\r\n\r\n17. NEWTON SPITZENBURG.—Tree, not large, upright but not compact, top\r\nopen; wood of medium size and vigor of growth; healthy, ripens early,\r\nand yet, now and then, it takes the frost-blight; bears moderately\r\nyoung, every other year, very abundantly; grafts well on the root,\r\nbuds only moderately well, good for nursery handling. Fruit, varying\r\nmuch in size, but often large, flesh melting, juicy; flavor rich,\r\nspicy, subacid; ripens from November to January.\r\n\r\n18. RHODE ISLAND GREENING.—Tree large, very spreading and drooping,\r\ngrows vigorously, healthy, ripens early, not subject to frost-blight;\r\nbud takes well; but, whether grafted on the root, or budded, it will\r\nplague the nurseryman by its disposition to spread and twist about\r\nlike a quince bush. It should be budded on strong stocks at the height\r\nat which the top is to be formed; but it always overgrows the stock.\r\nFruit very large, color green, with cloudy spots dotted with pin-point\r\nblack specks; flesh breaking, tender and juicy: flavor mild, rich,\r\nsubacid; a very popular fruit. Ripens from November to January.\r\n\r\n19. HUBBARDSTON NONESUCH.—Admirable in nursery; works well on root or\r\nby bud. We give Downing’s description, as it has not fruited in this\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n     “A fine, large, early winter fruit, which originated in the\r\n     town of Hubbardston, Mass., and is of first rate quality.\r\n     The tree is a vigorous grower, forming a handsome branching\r\n     head, and bears very large crops. It is worthy of extensive\r\n     orchard culture.\r\n\r\n     “Fruit large, roundish-oblong, much narrower near the eye.\r\n     Skin smooth, striped with splashes, and irregular broken\r\n     stripes of pale and bright red, which nearly cover a\r\n     yellowish ground. The calyx open, and the stalk short, in a\r\n     russeted hollow. Flesh yellow, juicy, and tender, with an\r\n     agreeable mingling of sweetness and acidity in its flavor.\r\n     October to January.”\r\n\r\n20. MINISTER.—We give Manning’s description:\r\n\r\n     “This fine apple originated in Rowley, Mass. The size is\r\n     large, the form oblong like the Bellflower, tapering to the\r\n     eye, with broad ridges the whole length of the fruit; the\r\n     skin a light greenish yellow, striped with bright red, but\r\n     the red seldom extends to the eye; flesh yellow, light, high\r\n     flavored and excellent. This is one of the very finest\r\n     apples which New England has produced. It ripens from\r\n     November to February, and deserves a place in every\r\n     collection of fruits, however small. This apple received its\r\n     present name from the circumstance of the late Rev. Dr.\r\n     Spring, of Newburyport, having purchased the first fruit\r\n     brought to market.”\r\n\r\n21. VANDERVEER PIPPIN.—Tree large, one of the most vigorous,\r\nspreading, but not drooping; ripens its wood late, occasionally\r\ntouched with frost-blight and liable to burst at the surface of the\r\nground during the winter. Bears young, every year, and very\r\nabundantly. Buds well, grafts well on the root, grows off strongly,\r\nforms a top readily, and will please nurserymen. Fruit large, more\r\nuniformly of one size all over the tree than any in the orchard; shape\r\nof fruit flat; color, red stripes on a yellow, russety ground. Flesh\r\ncoarse, gritty; flavor strong, penetrating, without aroma; December to\r\nMarch. This fruit is remarkable for having almost every good quality\r\nof tree and fruit and being notwithstanding a third-rate apple. The\r\ntree is hardy, its bloom, from peculiar hardiness, escapes injury from\r\nfrost, and even a second set of blossoms put out, though feeble ones,\r\nif the first are destroyed. The fruit is comely, cooks admirably,\r\nkeeps well; but a certain sharpness and coarseness will always make it\r\nbut a second or third-rate fruit. No tree is sought by farmers in this\r\nregion, with more avidity. Its origin is doubtful. Brunson, of Wayne\r\nCounty, brought it to Indiana, and all our nurseries trace their stock\r\nto his. It was carried for the first time to New Jersey, by Quakers\r\nvisiting that region, from his orchard. It should have been mentioned,\r\nthat it holds its age remarkably well, very old trees producing as\r\nlargely, and as fair, sound fruit as when young.\r\n\r\n22. YELLOW BELLE FLEUR, OR BELLFLOWER.—Tree spreads and droops more\r\nthan any tree of the orchard, the Newark pippin, perhaps, excepted;\r\nwood very slender and whip-like, healthy, ripens early, not subject to\r\nfrost-blight, grafts well on the root, but is rather tender during the\r\nfirst winter when so worked; buds well, but from its drooping,\r\nsprawling habits, is hard to form into a top. Bears moderately young\r\n(not so young as the white); abundantly. Flesh melting and tender and\r\njuicy; flavor fine and delicate rather than high; color deep yellow\r\nwhen ripe; ripens from December to March. One of the most deservedly\r\npopular of winter apples and always salable in all markets.\r\n\r\n23. WHITE BELLE FLEUR.—This apple is cultivated in Ohio under the\r\nnames of _Hollow-cored Pippin_, _Ohio favorite_, and, by the\r\nCincinnati pomologists, of _Detroit_. It is also the _Cumberland\r\nSpice_ and _Monstrous Bellflower_ of Coxe. It was taken to the West by\r\nBrunson of Wayne County, Indiana, and thence disseminated in every\r\ndirection; and it may be called _the_ Bellflower of Indiana, since it\r\nand not the yellow, predominates in all orchards. The yellow, however,\r\nwithin five years, has been largely distributed. Tree, medium sized,\r\nspreading; wood stronger than the yellow belle fleur, healthy, ripens\r\nits wood early, but liable to after-growth in warm falls, and\r\ntherefore subject to frost-blight. The tree, from its habit of growth,\r\nmore liable to split and break under a full crop than any tree of the\r\norchard. One of the youngest bearers in the nursery; fruitful to a\r\nfault. Grafted on the root it kills off in winter; buds well and forms\r\na top without difficulty. Fruit above medium and sometimes very large;\r\ncolor, greenish white, and, in some seasons with a blush on the sunny\r\nside; flesh breaking at first, but when fully ripe, melting and juicy;\r\nflavor mild and delicate. It is not apt to cloy, and more can be eaten\r\nthan of almost any variety. Ripe from December to March.\r\n\r\n24. BALDWIN.—Works well in nursery by root or bud, and is fine for\r\nnurserymen. Top forms easily. Not upright, as Downing says, but a\r\nround, spreading top. We give Downing’s description:\r\n\r\n     “The Baldwin stands at the head of New England apples, and\r\n     is unquestionably a first-rate fruit in all respects. It is\r\n     a native of Massachusetts, and is more largely cultivated\r\n     for the Boston market than any other sort. It bears most\r\n     abundantly, and we have had the satisfaction of raising\r\n     larger, more beautiful, and highly favored specimens here,\r\n     than we ever saw in its native region. The Baldwin, in\r\n     flavor and general characteristics, evidently belongs to the\r\n     same family as Esopus Spitzenburg, and deserves its\r\n     extensive popularity.\r\n\r\n     “Fruit large, roundish, and narrowing a little to the eye.\r\n     Skin yellow in the shade, but nearly covered and striped\r\n     with crimson, red, and orange, in the sun; dotted with a few\r\n     large russet dots, and with radiating streaks of russet\r\n     about the stalk. Calyx closed, set in a rather narrow\r\n     plaited basin. Stalk half to three fourths of an inch long,\r\n     rather slender for so large a fruit, planted in an even,\r\n     moderately deep cavity. Flesh yellowish white, crisp, with\r\n     that agreeable mingling of the saccharine and acid which\r\n     constitutes a rich, high flavor. The tree is a vigorous,\r\n     upright grower, and bears most abundantly. Ripe from\r\n     November to March, but attains its greatest perfection in\r\n     January.”\r\n\r\n25. MICHAEL HENRY PIPPIN.—Tree upright, with a round-shaped top; wood\r\nstrong, rather slow grower, ripens its main growth of wood early, but\r\nliable to fresh growth in warm, wet falls; bears very young, every\r\nother year abundantly and not a single apple in the next year. Should\r\nnot be grafted on the root; and it is rather troublesome when budded,\r\nfrom a disposition to make dwarf spur-like branches, rather than\r\nupright limbs. Fruit medium-sized, long, large about the base,\r\nsharpening toward the eye; color green, clouded and black speckled;\r\nflesh tender, melting; flavor rich, inclined to sweet, and very fine.\r\nRipens from December to March.\r\n\r\n26. RED SWEET PIPPIN.—Tree handsome, round-topped, but rather\r\nspreading; wood strong, and vigorous growth, ripens early; tree very\r\nhealthy, apt to grow with very smooth bark affording little shelter\r\nfor insects; bears young, every year and abundantly. Works well in the\r\nnursery either by grafting on the root, or by budding. Fruit medium\r\nsize inclining to large; color red with grey stripes on the shaded\r\nside; flesh breaking and firm; flavor sweet and rich. It bakes well,\r\nis good for pies, eats well, and its kitchen and table qualities\r\ncombined make it a desirable fruit. Ripe from December to April.\r\n\r\n27. PRYOR’S RED.—Tree upright; wood slow growing, slender, and the\r\nbranches full of small wood, healthy, not subject to frost-blight;\r\ncomes very late into bearing, requiring ten or twelve years for full\r\nbearing; bears only moderate crops; every year. Difficult to work in\r\nthe nursery, but does better by grafting on the root than by budding.\r\nFruit above medium size; color, red dotted with white specks; the\r\nwhole surface covered with slight bloom; flesh melting; flavor very\r\nrich and high, and by some thought to be even richer than the golden\r\nrusset. If this apple only grew on the Vanderveer pippin tree, it\r\nwould require nothing more to render it perfect. Ripens from December\r\nto March. Its keeping properties are more in danger from the _teeth_\r\nthan from ordinary decay. A very salable and popular apple, which,\r\nwhen once had, none would consent to lose. It is unknown in New\r\nEngland and New York except by description; and is not even described\r\nby Downing, and but little more than mentioned by Kenrick.\r\n\r\n28. GREEN NEWTOWN PIPPIN.—Tree spreading, wood slender and slow\r\ngrowing; ripens early, making it often troublesome for nurserymen to\r\nprocure buds fit for late work; not subject to frost-blight. The tree\r\nrequires vigorous cultivation to redeem it from a feeble growth; the\r\nbark is inclined to crack on the branches and scale up, and when once\r\nroughened it is difficult ever again to make them smooth. Late coming\r\ninto bearing, bears abundantly every other year. They should never be\r\ngrafted on the root; they should be budded on strong healthy stocks\r\nand high up in order to do well. Fruit large, green, changing to\r\nyellow when dead-ripe; flesh firm, breaking; flavor very rich. Ripe\r\nfrom February to May. This apple is cultivated in extraordinary\r\nabundance at the East both for home and foreign markets. They sell in\r\nLondon, at sixpence a piece. The farm of R. L. Pell contains 2,000\r\nbearing trees of this variety; a note descriptive of which we give\r\nfrom Downing:\r\n\r\n     “One of the finest orchards in America is that of Pellham\r\n     farm, at Esopus, on the Hudson. It is no less remarkable for\r\n     the beauty and high flavor of its fruit, than the constant\r\n     productiveness of trees. The proprietor, R. L. Pell, Esq.,\r\n     has kindly furnished us with some notes of his experiments\r\n     on fruit-trees, and we subjoin the following highly\r\n     interesting one on the apple.\r\n\r\n     “For several years past, I have been experimenting on the\r\n     apple, having an orchard of 2,000 bearing Newtown\r\n     Pippin-trees. I found it very unprofitable to wait for what\r\n     is termed the ‘bearing year,’ and it has been my aim to\r\n     assist nature, so as to enable the trees to bear every year.\r\n     I have noticed that from the excessive productiveness of\r\n     this tree, it requires the intermediate year to recover\r\n     itself—to extract from the earth and the atmosphere the\r\n     materials to enable it to produce again. This it is not able\r\n     to do, unassisted by art, while it is loaded with fruit, and\r\n     the intervening year is lost; if, however, the tree is\r\n     supplied with proper food it will bear every year; at least\r\n     such has been the result of my experiments. Three years ago,\r\n     in April, I scraped all the rough bark from the stems of\r\n     several thousand trees in my orchards, and washed all the\r\n     trunks and limbs within reach with soft soap; trimmed out\r\n     all the branches that crossed each other early in June, and\r\n     painted the wounded part with white lead, to exclude\r\n     moisture and prevent decay. I then, in the latter part of\r\n     the same month, slit the bark by running a sharp-pointed\r\n     knife from the ground to the first set of limbs, which\r\n     prevents the tree from becoming bark-bound, and gives the\r\n     young wood an opportunity of expanding. In July I placed one\r\n     peck of oyster-shell lime under each tree, and left it piled\r\n     about the trunk until November, during which time the\r\n     drought was excessive. In November the lime was dug in\r\n     thoroughly. The following year I collected from these trees\r\n     1,700 barrels of fruit, part of which was sold in New York\r\n     for four, and others in London for nine dollars per barrel.\r\n     The cider made from the refuse, delivered at the mill two\r\n     days after its manufacture, I sold for three dollars and\r\n     three-quarters per barrel of thirty-two gallons, exclusive\r\n     of the barrel. In October I manured these trees with stable\r\n     manure in which the ammonia had been fixed, and covered this\r\n     immediately with earth. The succeeding autumn they were\r\n     literally bending to the ground with the finest fruit I ever\r\n     saw, while the other trees in my orchard not so treated were\r\n     quite barren, the last season having been their bearing\r\n     year. I am now placing round each tree one peck of charcoal\r\n     dust, and propose in the spring to cover it from the compost\r\n     heap.\r\n\r\n     “‘My soil is a strong, deep, sandy loam on a gravelly\r\n     subsoil. I cultivate my orchard grounds as if there were no\r\n     trees on them, and raise grain of every kind except rye,\r\n     which grain is so very injurious that I believe three\r\n     successive crops of it would destroy any orchard younger\r\n     than twenty years. I raised last year in an orchard\r\n     containing twenty acres, trees eighteen years old, a crop of\r\n     Indian corn which averaged 140 bushels of ears to the acre.’”\r\n\r\n29. RAWLE’S JANET, OR JENNETTING.—Tree round topped, a little\r\nspreading and handsome. Wood strong, slow growth, short jointed, and\r\nthe healthiest, perhaps, of all orchard trees. Does not bear young;\r\nbut when established, a great bearer every year, unless overloaded,\r\nwhen it rests a year. It is the finest of all apples to graft on the\r\nroot, and should be always so propagated in the nursery; if budded, it\r\nbeing a late starter in spring, the stock will put out its branches\r\nbefore the bud, and make great trouble. Fruit medium sized; color\r\ngreen striped with red; roundish but inclined to sharpen toward the\r\neye; flesh white, melting, very juicy; flavor mild and delicate.\r\nRipens from February to May. This is, and deserves to be, an\r\nexceedingly popular apple in all the West. The tree is remarkably\r\nhealthy; it blooms ten days later than other varieties, and therefore\r\nseldom loses a crop by spring frost; but the bloom is very sensitive\r\nto frost if overtaken; the fruit is very relishful; keeps as well as\r\nthe Newtown Pippin, and by many, and by this writer among the number,\r\nis much preferred to that noted variety. It has the peculiar\r\nexcellence of enduring frost without material injury; a property which\r\nhas enabled cultivators to save thousands of bushels of fruit which by\r\nsudden and early cold had been severely frosted.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe reason that the Cockle-bur, that great pest on farms, cannot be\r\ndestroyed by being cut off once a year, is that nature has provided\r\nfor its propagation by bestowing on it seed vessels which ripen at two\r\ndifferent times of the year. This will be found to be the case on\r\ncareful examination.—_Western Farmer and Gardener._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF SOME VARIETIES OF FRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of our fine fruits has many curious points of interest to\r\nthe zealous pomologist. It is made up of skill, felicitous blunders,\r\ndiscoveries, and profitable accidents.\r\n\r\nThe Flemish pears, with which so large a portion of the calendar of\r\nnew pears is filled, were the products of scientific efforts. In like\r\nmanner, many of the finest fruits originated by Knight, were by a\r\nscientific, although a different, process. On the other hand it would\r\nbe difficult to find fruits superior to those in the making of which\r\nonly Nature had a hand.\r\n\r\nThe _Duchesse d’Angoulême_, a pear without a rival, in its season, was\r\nfound in 1815, growing wild in a hedge, near Angers, in the department\r\nof Maine et Loire, France.\r\n\r\nThe _Washington_, one of our finest native pears, was likewise\r\ndiscovered in a thorn hedge, at Naaman’s creek, Delaware, by Gen.\r\nRobertson. He was removing a fence on his farm about forty-five years\r\nago; he found the young tree nearly grown.\r\n\r\nThe _Lewis_ is a native of Massachusetts. Mr. Downer, of Dorchester, a\r\ncritical judge of fruits, was acquainted with the original tree ten\r\nyears before he thought it worth a place in his garden. He visited it\r\nthree times, and was each time disinclined to cultivate it; it was not\r\nuntil he had seen a tree taken from it, growing in cultivated ground,\r\nthat he adopted it. It now ranks among the finest native pears.\r\n\r\n_Dearborn’s Seedling_ was discovered by General Dearborn in a cluster\r\nof syringas and rose bushes, forming a part of a border to an avenue.\r\nPears seem to have great fondness for hedges, borders, etc. The\r\ndiscoverer attempted to remove the tree, then, apparently, about five\r\nyears old, to his nursery for a stock; but digging two feet deep, and\r\nfinding no root but the tap root, he feared that deplanting might kill\r\nit. It was left to grow, and has proved to be one of the first-class\r\npears.\r\n\r\n_Downer’s late cherry_, was a stock in the nursery row, and several\r\ntimes budded with other kinds; the buds always failing, the tree was\r\nallowed to fruit, and proved one of the best, if not _the_ best, of\r\nlate cherries.\r\n\r\n_Knight’s Black Eagle_ was raised from the seed of the Bigarreau\r\nfertilized by the May Duke. When it bore, the fruit was so inferior\r\nthat the London Horticultural Society peremptorily rejected it. Mr.\r\nKnight determined to head the tree down and graft into it other sorts.\r\nBut he had given the tree to a daughter, with whom it was a favorite,\r\nand she refused to have it sacrificed. Each year, subsequently, showed\r\nan improvement in the fruit; and now it stands in the first class of\r\ncherries. This is one among many instances, which show that young\r\nseedlings do not exhibit the true qualities of the fruit for several\r\nyears after they come to bearing.\r\n\r\nThe _Red-cheek Melocoton_ peach was accidentally obtained by the late\r\nWm. Prince, Flushing, Long Island. He had budded the Kennedy’s\r\nCaroline upon a stock, and below the point of inoculation a branch of\r\nthe original stock had shot up into bearing. Sending a servant to\r\ngather the budded fruit, he was surprised by his bringing, and, as he\r\ndeclared, from this tree, a free-stone peach. On examining, he found\r\nthe cause as stated above, and was so much pleased with the new kind\r\nthat he cultivated it.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe best stock a man can invest in, is the stock of a farm; the best\r\nshares are plow-shares; and the best banks are the fertile banks of\r\nthe rural stream: the more these are broken the better dividends they\r\npay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUINCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have nothing to say that has not been well said by Downing, in his\r\nmost interesting chapter on the Quince. His _Fruit and Fruit Trees of\r\nAmerica_, by the way, is beyond all question the best pomological\r\nmanual, all things considered, which has appeared at home or abroad.\r\n\r\nTo return to the quince; we marvel that so few trees have found a\r\nplace in our collections of fruit. Quinces bear transportation, and\r\nwill, upon an average, bring two dollars a bushel. They sell\r\nextravagantly high every year, and yet no one seems to take the hint.\r\n\r\nOur favorite mode of increasing the quince, is by layers. The tree\r\nbeing low and inclined to be bushy, there is always an abundance of\r\nsuitable wood to lay down. Twenty or thirty or even more rooted plants\r\nmay be obtained in a single season; and the layers throw out such a\r\nprofusion of roots that the only difficulty will be to separate each\r\nplant with its roots from the tough and matted abundance which will be\r\nfound to have filled the soil. If laid down in the spring, they may be\r\nremoved by midsummer, a cool and moist day being chosen, and the\r\nplants shaded until they start again to growing. If this is done, a\r\nsecond set of layers may be put down to remain over fall and winter\r\nand be removed the next spring.\r\n\r\nTrees intended for the fruit-compartment of the garden should be\r\ntrained to a _single_ stem, when they will make a low and not\r\naltogether unsymmetrical tree; at any rate, a tree much more\r\nconvenient than the quince _bush_ which we usually find in our garden\r\ncorners.\r\n\r\nWhere the seed is to be planted, they should be _prepared_; they are\r\ncovered with a thick mucilaginous matter which restrains their quick\r\ngermination. Let them be put into water for twelve hours, and the\r\nwater will become nearly as thick as paste. Pour it off and repeat the\r\noperation until they are nearly clean; mix them with sand and sow them\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTING AND KEEPING GRAFTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany experienced orchardists suppose the best time for cutting grafts\r\nto be immediately on the fall of the leaf in autumn.\r\n\r\nGrafts should be cut in mild weather, when the wood is entirely free\r\nfrom frost. Select the _outside_ limbs and the last year’s growth of\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nToo much care cannot be observed in _keeping the varieties separate_.\r\nTie up in bundles and mark the names of each kind as soon as cut. A\r\nmoment’s carefulness may save years of vexation.\r\n\r\nWhen the grafts are to be used at home, it is well to lay them in the\r\ncellar where frost will not reach them, and slightly cover them, _so\r\nthat they shall not evaporate the moisture which they contain_. Too\r\nmuch wet injures them. Half-dry sand is as good as anything, and if\r\npacked in an old nail-keg and put in a cool place, they will require\r\nno further attention until it is time to use them.\r\n\r\nWhen grafts are to be sent to a considerable distance, they should be\r\ncarefully wrapped in moist cloth, with folds enough to exclude the air\r\nentirely. For convenience of carrying they may be packed, in this\r\ncondition, in a box, and the space filled in with cotton-wool, chaff,\r\nbran, or any similar substance.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by some, that grafts taken from the lower limbs of trees\r\nwill produce fruit the soonest; while those from the middle and top\r\nand from the upright shoots will make trees of the finest form. We\r\nconfess a slight prejudice against the lower limbs of trees, as it was\r\nthence that “switches” were cut in the mischievous days of our youth,\r\nwherewith to apply Solomon’s doctrine of discipline. Whether they will\r\nmake upright trees, we cannot say; but they are supposed to have a\r\ntendency to make upright men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROST-BLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of great importance that all cultivators of fruit unite\r\nin making observations on this subject, and that it may be done with\r\nsome unity of purpose.\r\n\r\n1. Let the examiner select trees upon which are seen small\r\n_water-shoots_, that have evidently grown late in the fall. Usually, a\r\ntuft of withered leaves will indicate them. Examine also all the new\r\nwood which retains terminal leaves or is winter-killed at the tips.\r\n\r\n2. The pith will be, in apples, an iron-rust color, and in pears\r\ngreenish black or pepper color; the inner skin will be discolored, and\r\nthe wood of a greenish, waxy appearance. On cutting down to the point\r\nwhere these shoots unite with the branch or trunk, the diseased sap\r\nwill be found to have discolored the whole neighborhood. In many cases\r\nwhich we have examined, half the trunk is affected. We examined a\r\nbearing pear-tree, which to the eye has not one sign of unhealthiness,\r\nbut which, on cutting, is found to be affected throughout, and will,\r\nundoubtedly, die in spring.\r\n\r\n3. Let a comparison be instituted between trees in different\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIs there any difference between slow-growing varieties and those which\r\ngrow rapidly?\r\n\r\nIs there any difference between trees in cold, northern aspects, whose\r\nsap, in autumn, would not be likely to be excited, and those with\r\nsouthern aspects?\r\n\r\nIs there a difference between trees upon a fat clay or rank loam of\r\nany kind, and those upon a warm, dry, sandy loam. It is supposed that\r\nany causes which produce a coarse, watery, flabby tissue in a tree,\r\npredispose it to injury by frost, and thus to the blight; and that the\r\nfineness and firmness of texture of trees growing in a sand-loam on a\r\ngravelly subsoil give them great power of endurance.\r\n\r\n4. Let trees which are found to be in an injured condition be marked\r\nand examined again as follows:\r\n\r\n(1.) At the breaking up of winter, to see if any change of condition\r\nhas taken place.\r\n\r\n(2.) At the breaking of the bud into leaf.\r\n\r\n(3.) At the full development of leaf and when the downward current of\r\nsap is begun.\r\n\r\n5. It is a matter of great importance to ascertain whether the\r\ncharacter of the season which follows such frost-injuries as have\r\nbefallen fruit-trees in this region, modifies the disease. Some think\r\nthat blight will follow without regard to the ensuing season; others\r\nsuppose that a _dry_, and warm season will very much prevent the\r\nmischief; but that a _moist_ and warm spring and summer, will give it\r\na fatal development.\r\n\r\nIt is ardently to be hoped that accurate observations will be made,\r\nand upon a large scale. We presume that it need not be added that the\r\n_exact truth of facts_ is the first step toward any sound explanation;\r\nand that our object should be to _find out facts_, and then,\r\nafterward, to deduce principles.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBOILING POTATOES.—Not one housekeeper out of ten knows how to boil\r\npotatoes properly. Here is an Irish method, one of the best we know.\r\nClean wash the potatoes and leave the skin on; then bring the water to\r\na boil and throw them in. As soon as boiled soft enough for a fork to\r\nbe easily thrust through them, dash some cold water into the pot, let\r\nthe potatoes remain two minutes, and then pour off the water. This\r\ndone, half remove the pot-lid, and let the potatoes remain over a slow\r\nfire till the steam is evaporated; then peel and set them on the table\r\nin an _open_ dish. Potatoes of a good kind thus cooked, will always be\r\nsweet, dry and mealy. A covered dish is bad for potatoes, as it keeps\r\nthe steam in, and makes them soft and watery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDLING FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready the varieties of hardy fruits have become so numerous, that\r\nnot only can they not all be cultivated, but the mere list of names is\r\ntoo bulky to be printed. Downing’s book gives a list of 181 apples.\r\nThe London Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, expurgated at that,\r\ngives 900 kinds of apples, and 1,500 have been tested in the Society’s\r\ngardens. Manning’s experimental grounds and nursery at the time of his\r\ndeath, contained 1,000 named varieties of the pear! Swollen as is the\r\nlist, there are scores annually added; many under the advice of\r\nscientific bodies; many have popular approbation; many from the\r\npartialities of some parental nurseryman; and many come in, as evil\r\ncame into this world, no one can tell how.\r\n\r\nIt has become necessary, therefore, to exclude many from the\r\ncatalogue, and especially necessary that none should enter without the\r\nvery best passport. In the main, one set of tests will serve, both for\r\nreceiving and expurgating; for no matter how long a fruit has been on\r\nthe list, it should be ejected if, being out, its qualities would not\r\ngain it a fresh admission. There are no hereditary rights, or rights\r\nof occupancy, in pomological lists.\r\n\r\nTitles, rank, antiquity, pedigree and other merciful means of\r\ncompensating a want of personal merit, may do for _men_ but not for\r\n_apples_. A very glorious pomological reformation broke out in the\r\nLondon Horticultural Society’s gardens at Chiswick, and that Luther of\r\nthe orchard, Mr. Thompson, has abolished an astonishing number of\r\nsinecures, and reformed, if not worthless rotten boroughs, very\r\nworthless apples and pears. The Society’s first catalogue issued in\r\n1826. Its third catalogue was published in December of 1842. The\r\nexperience of the intervening sixteen years led to the total rejection\r\nfrom their list, on the ground of inferiority, or as synonyms, of 600\r\nvarieties of apples; 139 of cherries; 200 of gooseberries; 82 of\r\ngrapes, 80 of strawberries; 150 of peaches; 200 of pears; and 150 of\r\nplums. Only _twenty-eight_ peaches are allowed to stand; and only\r\n_twenty-six_ strawberries out of the hundreds that were proved. We\r\nhave no similar society in the United States whose authority would be\r\ngenerally acknowledged. Our only resource is the diffusion of the very\r\nbest fruits that every neighborhood may have a standard of comparison\r\nby the reduction of experience to the form of rules. Although it is\r\ndifficult to lay down general rules on this subject, there are three\r\nwhich may be mentioned.\r\n\r\n1. _No fruit should be admitted to the list and none retained upon it,\r\nwhich is decidedly poor._—One would suppose this truism to be\r\nsuperfluous as a rule. But it is only necessary to go out into\r\nseedling orchards in any neighborhood to find small, tough, and\r\nflavorless apples, which hold their place alongside of orchards filled\r\nwith choice grafted fruit.\r\n\r\n2. _No seedling fruit should be added to the list, which is in no\r\nrespect better than those of the same period of ripening already\r\ncultivated._—It is not enough that an apple is nearly or quite as good\r\nas another favorite apple. It must be as good in flavor, and better in\r\nsome of its habits.\r\n\r\n3. _In testing the merits of fruit, an estimate should be the result\r\nof a consideration of all the habits, jointly, of the tree and of the\r\nfruit._—It is in the application of this rule that great experience\r\nand judgment are required. This will be plain, if one considers how\r\nmany essential particulars enter into a first-rate fruit beside mere\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nOf two fruits equal in flavor, one may surpass the other in tenderness\r\nof flesh, in juiciness, in delicacy of skin, and in size. It is rare\r\nthat any single fruit combines all these excellences, and therefore it\r\nis that we retain several varieties, among which such properties are\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nThere are many fruits which, having good substance and flavor, derive\r\ntheir value from some single peculiarity. Thus a fruit may be no\r\nbetter than many others, but the tree, blooming very late in spring,\r\nis seldom overtaken by prowling and irregular frosts. Some of our best\r\nfruits have stingy bearing-trees, or trees of very tender and delicate\r\nhabit; and we are obliged to tolerate more hardy and prolific trees\r\nwith fruit somewhat inferior.\r\n\r\nA few fruits are retained on the list because they have the singular\r\nproperty of being uninjured by frosts, and others because, though not\r\nremarkable for flavor, they are endless keepers, of both which\r\nproperties the Rawle’s Jennetting is an example.\r\n\r\nIn fruits designed for market, beauty and abundance must be allowed to\r\nsupersede mere excellence of flavor. Some very rich fruits are borne\r\nin such a parsimonious way that none but amateurs can afford\r\ntree-room.\r\n\r\nNor are we to overlook nursery qualifications; for, of two fruits\r\nequally good, preference should be given to that which will work the\r\nkindliest in the nursery. Some will bear grafting on the root, some\r\nwill not; some take well by budding, and grow off promptly and with\r\nforce; others are dull and slugglish, and often reluctant to form the\r\nnew partnership. While then it will always be to the nurseryman’s\r\ninterest to work such kinds as he can sell the most of—he has a right,\r\nin so far as he directs the public judgment of his neighborhood, to\r\ngive a preference, among equal fruits, to such as work the surest and\r\nstrongest. It is as much the interest of the purchaser and the public\r\nto have the freest growing sorts, as it is the nurseryman’s interest.\r\nThus, if another Seckle pear could be found growing on the tree of\r\nWilliams’ _Bon Chrétien_, it ought to supplant the old Seckle tree,\r\nwhich, in spite of its incomparable fruit, is a vexatious thing to\r\nmanage; and, as often in the case of other and fairer fruit, makes one\r\nwonder how such amiable and beautiful daughters ever had such a surly\r\nand crusty old father.\r\n\r\nA pomological censor must also have regard to varieties of taste among\r\nmen, and to commercial qualities of fruit, and to its adaptation to\r\nsoil and climate.\r\n\r\nNo one man has a right to make his tongue the monarch over other\r\npeople’s tongues. Therefore, for instance, it is none of our business,\r\nif a rugged mouth chooses to roll a slice of the austere Vanderveer\r\npippin, like sin, as a sweet morsel under his tongue. The mild\r\ndelicacy of an apple, which fills our mouths with admiration, would be\r\nmere insipidity to all who are favored with leather mouths. So that\r\nthere must be toleration even among apple-mongers.\r\n\r\nNor are the humbler tests of cooking to be overlooked. Some fruits are\r\ngood eaters and poor cookers; some cook well but are villainous to the\r\ntaste when raw; some will stew to a fine flavor and sweetness _without\r\nsugar_, and some have remarkable jelly properties. But after the\r\nlargest allowance is made for taste, hardiness, keeping, prolific\r\nbearing, color, size, texture, season, adaptation to soils, etc.,\r\netc., there will be found, we think, a large number of tenants in our\r\nnurserymen’s catalogues, upon whom should be instantly served a writ\r\nof ejectment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME FOR PRUNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not believe in severe pruning at _any_ time. If a man has the\r\neducation of his orchard from the start, it is an utter abomination to\r\nleave his trees in such a condition as to require it. If, however, one\r\ncomes into possession of a much abused orchard, or of a seedling\r\norchard; or, if a single tree is to be changed, or an old tree is to\r\nbe headed back for health’s sake, then it may be necessary to prune\r\nwith a free hand. But in such cases, the change should not be\r\nattempted in one season, but divided between two.\r\n\r\nThere is, we suppose, a critical time in which pruning will injure the\r\ntree. It is after the sap is in full motion, the vegetable system\r\nimpleted, _but before the pores and sap passages have acquired a\r\ncontractile power_. Thus, if a grape is pruned when the buds begin to\r\nswell, the wood does not contract, and the vine bleeds to excess. But\r\nif primed after the leaves are as large as the palm of the hand, no\r\ninjury ensues from cutting, for now the sap passages contract and\r\nclose speedily.\r\n\r\nThus if a tree be handled before or after this period, it does not\r\nsuffer; but if pruned _at this critical state of the wood_, it will\r\nbleed, the stump part will become diseased, probably from the relaxed\r\nstate of the woody tissue, and canker will ensue—a word indicating, we\r\npresume, simply a state of decay, covered by or accompanied with, some\r\nsort of fungus growth.\r\n\r\nPruning before this critical time, is sometimes the most convenient.\r\nBut if it be a question, at which of the two periods is the tree in a\r\nstate to suffer the least, and to recover the soonest, we say, _after\r\nit is in full leaf and well a-growing_, viz. the last of May and the\r\nfirst of June. The wood has then a contractile force, does not bleed;\r\nthe tree is making new wood with great energy, and has therefore a\r\nfull supply of organizable matter with which promptly to heal the\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nMr. O. V. Hill thus speaks in the _Boston Cultivator_:\r\n\r\n     “Fruit growers at the present day, are generally of the\r\n     opinion, that the proper time for pruning is the last of May\r\n     or early in June, when the tree is in full leaf and in a\r\n     vigorous, growing state. This, on many accounts, appears to\r\n     be the most suitable season, as the wounds heal much more\r\n     rapidly, the tree throws out less suckers, canker is avoided\r\n     and the sap circulates freely to every part of the tree; but\r\n     there are some objections to pruning in the early part of\r\n     summer, which I do not recollect to have seen noticed. Any\r\n     one who is familiar with vegetable physiology is aware that\r\n     there is a new layer of wood and a new layer of bark\r\n     deposited every year, and that in June this process is in\r\n     active operation; the newly-forming wood and bark are then\r\n     consequently in a tender and imperfect state, and very\r\n     susceptible to injury. Standing in the forks of the branches\r\n     as it is sometimes necessary to do in pruning, will\r\n     frequently separate the bark and wood, especially in young\r\n     trees at this season. In grafting late in the season, this\r\n     is frequently the case; sometimes where the ladder is placed\r\n     against a branch it will remove the bark; and in sawing,\r\n     unless the saw runs very clear, and the teeth are fine, the\r\n     same results will follow; if pruning is done in June, it\r\n     should be performed with the greatest caution.”\r\n\r\nThe New York _Farmer and Mechanic_, commenting on the above, says:\r\n\r\n     “The best time for pruning apple-trees is, as yet, we\r\n     believe, undetermined by the most experienced orchardists,\r\n     but we are of opinion that the early part of June is, for\r\n     reasons above given by Mr. Hill, to be preferred. The\r\n     objection arising from the fear of injuring the bark of the\r\n     tree can easily be obviated by having the operator use\r\n     _moccasins_ instead of shoes, and surrounding the upper\r\n     round of the latter with straw or flannel.”\r\n\r\nDowning says:\r\n\r\n     “We should especially avoid pruning at that period in spring\r\n     when the buds are swelling, and the sap is in full flow, as\r\n     the loss of sap by bleeding is very injurious to most trees,\r\n     and, in some, brings on a serious and incurable canker in\r\n     the limbs.\r\n\r\n     “There are advantages and disadvantages attending all\r\n     seasons of pruning, but our own experience has led us to\r\n     believe that, practically, _a fortnight before midsummer is\r\n     by far the best season, on the whole, for pruning in the\r\n     northern and middle States_. Wounds made at this season heal\r\n     over freely and rapidly; it is the most favorable time to\r\n     judge of the shape and balance of the head, and to see at a\r\n     glance which branches require removal; and all the stock of\r\n     organizable matter in the tree is directed to the branches\r\n     that remain.”\r\n\r\nSome of the western States are so much earlier than that of New York,\r\nthat early June will be equivalent to the time specified by Downing.\r\nWe have now fortified the opinion which we heretofore expressed, by\r\ngood authority, and by what seems to us good reasons. As it is,\r\nhowever, with some, yet a debated question, we shall carefully insert\r\nthe experience of any man for or against our position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUMS AND THEIR ENEMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMultitudes of men have had plum-trees, and every year, for ten years,\r\nhave seen the fruit promise fair at first and then prematurely drop,\r\nwithout knowing the reason. Even well-informed men have said to us\r\nthat it arose from some defect in the _tree_, from too much _gum_,\r\nfrom a worm at the _root_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe plum-tree is very hardy; is less subject to disease than most\r\nfruit-trees; its fruit is highly prized; and the varieties of it are\r\nnumerous and many of them delicious. By a proper selection of trees a\r\nsuccession of fruit may be had from July to November. The trees are\r\nusually sure and enormous bearers, every year. With so many good\r\nqualities the cultivation of the plum is well-nigh prohibited, as a\r\ngarden or orchard fruit, by the valor of one little bug!\r\n\r\nThe _Curculio_ (a very hardy fellow, with a constitution yet\r\nunimpaired by such a name as _Rhynchœnus Nenuphar_!) is a small\r\nbeetle, about a quarter of an inch long, which attacks the plums\r\nalmost as soon as the fruit has set. They seek this, and almost all\r\nsmooth-skinned fruits, as a place of deposit for their eggs. Many of\r\nthe facts which we shall narrate, were mentioned to us by Mr. Payne of\r\nMadison, who has closely and curiously observed this depredator.\r\n\r\nAn incision is first made, of semicircular form, by a little rostra or\r\nlancet which he carries in his head for this very purpose. After the\r\nopening is made, the curculio deposits an egg therein; then changing\r\npositions again, it carefully, with its fore legs, secures the egg in\r\nits _nidus_, and pats the skin under the edge of which its treasure is\r\nhidden, with repeated and careful efforts of its feet. Where fruit\r\nabounds it deposits, usually, but one to a plum. But we have had\r\ntrees, just beginning to bear, whose few plums were scarified all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe egg hatches to a worm, and this feeds on the plum, causing it\r\nprematurely to fall; the insect issuing from it, enters the ground, to\r\nundergo its transformations, and soon to reappear, a beetle, ready for\r\nfresh mischief-making propagation.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the West is entirely glorious for all manner of\r\ninsects. They can put the East to shame in the matter of aphides,\r\ncockroaches, cutworms, army and wire-worms, curculios, peach-worms,\r\ngrubs, etc., etc. There are many questions relating to the history of\r\ninsects, about which eastern writers are in doubt, not at all doubtful\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n1. Do the larvæ remain in the ground all the residue of the summer,\r\nand come forth only in the ensuing spring? In cold latitudes it may be\r\nso. Harris says, that they undergo their transformation in twenty\r\ndays. Downing admits this of a few stragglers. But the main supply of\r\nbugs, he thinks, remains all summer and until spring, in the ground.\r\nBut with us the curculio is not exclusively an early summer insect. It\r\nis found, in its appropriate haunts, through the whole warm season.\r\nMr. Payne put plums containing the worms into a glass, and in eleven\r\ndays obtained full-grown curculios. In cool regions they probably have\r\nbut an annual generation; but in warm and long summers, in the West,\r\nthey reproduce often in each season.\r\n\r\n2. The mode of ascent has been a matter of doubt. J. J. Thomas, in the\r\n_Fruit Culturist_ says: “It has the power of using its wings in\r\nflying; but whether it crawls up the tree or ascends by flight,\r\nappears not to be certainly ascertained.”\r\n\r\nDowning admits that it flies, but says, “How far this insect flies is\r\nyet a disputed point, some cultivators affirming that it scarcely goes\r\nfurther than a single tree, and others-believing that it flies over a\r\nwhole neighborhood.”\r\n\r\nKenrick says: “They crawl up trees,” and he quotes an author as\r\nsaying: “That of two trees standing so near each other as to touch,\r\nthe fruit of one has been destroyed and the other has escaped; so\r\nlittle and so reluctantly do these insects incline to use their\r\nwings.” Dr. James Tilton says, in the “Domestic Encyclopedia,” that\r\n“they appear very reluctant to use their wings, and perhaps never\r\nemploy them but when necessity compels them to migrate.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that the curculio, in cold and chilly weather, is\r\ndisinclined to fly; but give it a right murderously hot day, and\r\n“McGregor’s on his native heath again.” Just before a thunder storm,\r\nin summer, in a still, sultry, sweltering day, they may be seen flying\r\namong the trees as blithely as any house-fly; alighting on your arm,\r\nor hand, and springing off again as nimbly as a flea.\r\n\r\nAll remedies founded on the idea of their crawling preferences will be\r\nsignal failures. Troughs about trees, bats of wool, bandages of all\r\nkinds about the trunk to impede the ascent will be found as useful as\r\nwould high fences to keep crows from a cornfield, or birds from the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nAll remedies for this pest succeed to a charm where the curculio does\r\nnot abound; and almost every one of them fails in places really\r\ninfested them.\r\n\r\nIn cities, and in country places which are far removed from all\r\norchards or gardens, the crops may be saved. It is not difficult to\r\ndefend a tree against all the curculios that are _bred upon it_.\r\nPavements; hard-rolled gravel; gathering up, daily, the fallen plums\r\nand destroying them; the application of salt, and many other remedies\r\nmay succeed where the curculio from other gardens or orchards cannot\r\neasily migrate to supply the trees with a fresh brood. Trees in\r\ncities, and in retired places, on this account, often bear\r\nplenteously.\r\n\r\nBut of what use is it to destroy five hundred larvæ, if twice that\r\nnumber of emigrants, from some other quarter, are anxious, the next\r\nspring, to _squat_ upon your trees, or to _enter_ them, in land-office\r\nstyle, most nefariously? All remedies founded on the destruction of\r\nthe larvæ will be totally useless if your trees can be reached from\r\nsome infected point abroad, as we have found to our sorrow. In our own\r\nexperience, and in that of other amateur-cultivators of fruit, the\r\npavement, salt, and all have been “love’s labor lost.” But in the\r\nexperience of others, in climates where the curculio does not abound,\r\nor in secluded situations, they have proved effectual.\r\n\r\nThe remedies to be employed, in ordinary cases, must be such as will\r\nconstantly molest the insect at his work. Inclosures, in which swine\r\nroot, and rub against the trees; lanes, where cattle resort, to rub\r\noff their hair in spring, to shade themselves in summer—these are the\r\nbest situations. In yards and gardens plum-trees should be placed upon\r\nthe most frequented paths; close to the well, by the kitchen door,\r\nnear the wood-house, so that, as often as possible, they may be jarred\r\nin passing and repassing.\r\n\r\nWhere a few trees stand apart in the garden, it is said that, daily,\r\nmorning and evening, by spreading a sheet under them, and giving the\r\ntree a sudden and violent blow with a mallet, the insects will drop\r\nand may then be gathered and destroyed. This should be performed while\r\nit is cool, as then, only, the curculio is somewhat torpid. If this\r\ncourse is pursued, a block should be put upon the tree, to receive the\r\nstroke, with a bit of carpet or some soft pad to it, that the bark may\r\nnot be injured. A white sheet should be spread under the tree to catch\r\nthe falling robber.\r\n\r\nA few trees will suffice for a private family, and the fruit must be\r\nearned by careful watchfulness. Those who are too indolent, or\r\ncareless, or indifferent to the luxury to bestow the requisite\r\nattention through the months of May and June, may spare themselves the\r\ntrouble of planting plum-trees. Plum _orchards_ are not to be thought\r\nof.\r\n\r\nAlthough the curculio chiefly delights in the plum, it scruples at no\r\nfruit. It may be found upon peaches, cherries, nectarines, apricots,\r\ngooseberries and currants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT GRAFTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile nothing can be done out of doors in the nursery, the process of\r\nroot grafting may be carried on, and the stock be ready for setting as\r\nsoon as the grounds are open in spring.\r\n\r\nWhen this method of grafting is employed with discretion, it greatly\r\naids the nurseryman. It is a resource in case he cannot procure stocks\r\nto bud or graft upon; it makes finer and handsomer trees; and it can\r\nbe carried on at a season of leisure; and the scions, being early in\r\nthe ground, have a longer season of growth by two months than buds, or\r\nordinary grafts.\r\n\r\nAlthough any healthy root with some fibres will answer to graft upon,\r\nyet experienced nurserymen prefer the _tap_ roots of young seedling\r\nstocks. Those who have apple and pear stocks which are to be removed,\r\nshould employ the open weather of winter to raise them. The tap roots\r\nmay be taken for grafting purposes and the stocks put away in cellars,\r\nor buried in the ground.\r\n\r\nWe do not know that there is any difference in favor of the root of\r\none variety over another; but it will not do to propagate every\r\nvariety of fruit by this method. Experience has shown that some sorts\r\ndo better by root grafting than in any other way; but other kinds are\r\nvery apt to be winter-killed; and some varieties have such a\r\nstraggling habit of growth, that it would be extremely difficult to\r\ntrain them to a good head; and such sorts, therefore, require to be\r\nbudded or grafted high up on good stocks.\r\n\r\nThe roots being washed, are cut into four or five inch pieces; and the\r\nscions prepared as for ordinary grafting. Splice, or tongue grafting\r\nis the most convenient method. Woollen yarn, cut to ten or twelve\r\ninches’ length, is wound around it closely at the point of junction.\r\nLet the grafting wax be kept in a melted state, by being put in a pan,\r\nover a few coals. Holding the work over the pan, with a spoon pour a\r\nportion of the liquid all over the yarn; it hardens immediately, and\r\nthe whole may be set in rows in a box and covered above the point of\r\nunion with moist sand, and kept in a cellar till it is time to turn\r\nthem out in the spring.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe cherry, plum, pear and apple trees, in a diseased condition, will\r\noften throw up numerous and thrifty sprouts that will offer to an\r\ninexperienced cultivator inviting temptations to multiply his stock at\r\na rapid rate with little labor. If he be deceived by these\r\nappearances, and propagate his valuable kinds upon these diseased\r\ngrowths, his efforts will ultimately result in his disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLIGHT AND INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an article on employing suckers of fruit-trees for stocks, which we\r\nshall copy, Dr. Kirtland says:\r\n\r\n     “The practice of grafting and budding pears upon this\r\n     quality of stocks has extended a diseased action, a kind of\r\n     canker among our pear orchards, that has, in some instances,\r\n     been mistaken for _blight_, a disease that has its origin in\r\n     the depredations of a minute coleopterous insect, which has\r\n     been satisfactorily described in all its stages of\r\n     transformation by Dr. Harris, and other Massachusetts\r\n     entomologists.”\r\n\r\nThat the fire-blight is, to any considerable extent anywhere, but\r\nespecially at the West, occasioned by an insect, is an idea, we\r\nbelieve, totally unsupported by facts. That some injury has been done\r\nby the _scolytus pyri_, the investigations of Mr. Lowell and Professor\r\nPeck leave no room to doubt. But we are not satisfied that, even in\r\nthese cases, they were the cause of the _blight_, but only an\r\naccidental concomitant. Did Mr. Lowell or Professor Peck _always_ find\r\nthis beetle upon blighted trees? Was it found in _every_ blighted\r\nlimb? Did not blight occur without these insects? Has any one of New\r\nEngland _since_ found the blight to proceed from the gnawings of this\r\nbeetle?\r\n\r\nHas any one found this beetle _before_ the blight occurred at its\r\nmischievous work, or is it only _after_ the blight is seen that the\r\nbeetle is found? If the _scolytus pyri_ has been _found_ only after\r\nthe tree is thoroughly affected, there is reason to suppose that it\r\ndid not _come_ until after the disease had prepared the way for it.\r\n\r\nWe are seriously skeptical of this alleged cause. Whatever may be true\r\nof the blight at the East, the blight in the West is unquestionably\r\nnot an effect of the _scolytus pyri_. We have examined with the utmost\r\npains, multitudes of trees in all soils—several of our shrewdest\r\nnurserymen have searched year by year, and we have, unfortunately, had\r\ntoo much opportunity and too many subjects, and yet no insect or\r\ninsect-track has been detected, except those which have attacked the\r\ntree in _consequence_ of the blight.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, we can find bugs, black, brown, green and grey, but the\r\nmere presence of an insect is nothing, though with many, it seems\r\nenough, when a tree is blighted, if a bug is found on it, to determine\r\nthe parentage of the mischief. Nor do the published accounts of\r\ninsects, found on blighted trees, increase our respect for this\r\ntheory. The observations seem to have been not thorough enough, and\r\nnot carefully made, and the reasonings even less philosophical. Men\r\nhave searched for a theory rather than for the mere facts in the case.\r\nBut by far the greatest number of those who write, give no evidence of\r\nrelying upon any observations which they have themselves made, but go\r\nback perpetually to the old precedents, Mr. Lowell and Professor Peck,\r\nwithout being at any pains to verify them, Has Dr. Kirtland ever found\r\nthe _scolytus pyri_? Has he ever, in time of extensive blight, found\r\nit under such circumstances as to satisfy his mind that it was the\r\nreal cause of fire-blight? or does he rest satisfied that blight is\r\noccasioned by an insect simply because so it is set down in good\r\nbooks? The canker may be mistaken for blight by those who have not\r\nbeen acquainted with either; but surely, no one who has ever\r\nattentively examined one real case of fire-blight, would ever mistake\r\nit for anything else, or anything else for it.\r\n\r\nThe insect theory we regard as wholly untenable except for special,\r\nlocal, peculiar ravages which are not properly _blights_. The blight\r\nis a disease of the _circulation_. It affects every tissue of the\r\nplant. It is not a disease from exhaustion of sap by the suction of\r\naphides, as Dr. Mosher, of Cincinnati, supposed, for the trees have a\r\nplethora rather than scarcity of sap; it lacerates the sap-vessels,\r\nbursts the bark, flows down the branches, and dries in globules upon\r\nthe trunk. On cutting the tree, if the blight is yet new, the texture\r\nof the alburnum will be found to resemble what is called a\r\n_water-core_ in the apple, its color is of a dirty greenish hue, soon\r\nchanging by exposure to brown and black. But if the blight is old, the\r\nwood is of a dingy white, the alburnum colored like iron rust, and the\r\nbark of a brownish black. These appearances are incompatible with any\r\nidea of exhaustion by the gnawing of the _scolytus pyri_, or the\r\nsuction of aphides, which would result in mere shrinking of parts,\r\ndryness and death. If insects have a hand in the mischief, it is by\r\nthe secretion of poison, of which fact, we have never seen the trace\r\nof proof, although it has often been suggested, and is by some\r\nempyrically asserted. To our minds the insect-poison-theory is\r\nimaginary. It is entirely convenient to refer every excrescence, or\r\nshrinking of parts, every watery suffusion, wart, discoloration,\r\ncrumpling leaf, wilting, etc., to poison, and still more convenient to\r\nfind the insect so atomic that it cannot _be_ found, and thus to heap\r\nthe multiform sins of the orchard on the scape-goat of a hypothetical\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nAs to electricity, as no one knows anything about this elemental\r\nsprite, his out-goings or in-comings, we are like to have acted over\r\nagain all the caprices of witch-times, when elves and gnomes cut up\r\nevery prank imaginable, and when any prank, which was cut up, of\r\ncourse was performed by them. Everybody is agog about electricity. But\r\nwe respectfully suggest that it is one thing to ascertain facts by\r\ncautious, guarded experiments or careful observation, and quite\r\nanother to set down everything, which one does not know what else to\r\ndo with, to electricity, simply because _it may be so for aught that\r\nwe know to the contrary_. People reason somewhat in this wise;\r\nelectricity performs a vast number of very mysterious operations,\r\ntherefore, every operation which is mysterious is performed by\r\nelectricity. We believe electricity to have something to do with it,\r\nonly because it seems to have concern with every living, growing\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the blight is, in all cases, the effect of frost upon\r\nthe sap. We have, until recently, supposed it to arise from autumnal\r\nfreezing, while the tree is in full growth. We are now inclined to\r\nsuppose that severe freezing and sudden thawing at any time, autumn,\r\nwinter or spring, _when the sap is in motion_, will result in blight.\r\nThe blight of 1844 was from the freezing of growing trees in the\r\nautumn of 1843, and the premonitory stages were clearly discernible in\r\nthe tree during the whole winter months before it broke out in its\r\nlast malignant form.\r\n\r\nWhen a warm winter allows continuous motion of sap, and sudden, severe\r\nfreezing with rapid thawing occurs, we _suppose_ it to cause a variety\r\nof blight. We are making investigations on this head, but are not yet\r\nprepared to speak with certainty.\r\n\r\nWhen a sudden violent freezing overtakes growing trees in spring, with\r\nrapid thaws, it, we suppose, results in a blight resembling the\r\nautumn-caused blight.\r\n\r\nWe are diligently searching into this whole matter, and hope to throw\r\nsome light upon it.\r\n\r\nBut now comes _the_ question. What is it that makes some trees so\r\nobnoxious to this evil while others escape? Why are some orchards\r\ngenerally affected, and contiguous orchards entirely saved?\r\n\r\nIt is very plain that the blight occurs, as a general disease, in some\r\nseasons more than in others, because it depends upon the peculiar\r\ncondition of the season, the time and degree of frosts. But it does\r\nnot seem so clear why, when these conditions are favorable to blight,\r\none tree should suffer, and the next in the row should not; why one\r\norchard should be depopulated, and another in the same town not\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nWe think that light will be afforded on this point by a consideration\r\nof the _texture_ of trees.\r\n\r\nWhen trees are rapidly grown by stimulating manures, or upon strong\r\nclay loams, or from any other cause, the wood is coarse, the passages\r\nenlarged, the tissue loose and spongy. The tree passes a great volume\r\nof sap—it is but imperfectly elaborated (as is seen by the late period\r\nto which such trees defer the bearing of fruit), and the tissues\r\nformed by it are correspondingly imperfect in wholesomeness,\r\ncompactness, and solidity of parts. The tree is bloated—is dropsical.\r\n\r\nOn gravelly soils, or loams with a gravelly subsoil, or on any kind of\r\nsoil, which gives a slow and thorough growth, the wood is fine, close\r\nand perfect; the vessels are not expanded, their sides are firmer,\r\nless sensitive to sudden changes of temperature, and when exposed to\r\nthem better able to resist them.\r\n\r\nWhatever soil produces rank or coarse wood, a flabby tissue will be\r\nsubject to blights. Whatever soil induces a fine-grained, compact\r\nfibre, and vigorous tissue, will be free from blight. The same is true\r\nof the various methods of cultivation; those who drive their trees,\r\nwho aim chiefly at a rapid and strong growth, will give their trees a\r\ncondition requisite for blight. Those who pursue a more cautious, a\r\nslower method, and look to the _quality_ rather than the _quantity_ of\r\ntheir wood, will be comparatively free from blight.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there may be seasons so extreme that blight will occur in\r\nthe most healthy tree; so disease will occur in the most temperate\r\nmen; yet temperance, conformity to the laws of nature, is the rule of\r\nhealth, and nonconformity the preparation for disease.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, will those who are unfortunate enough to have a good\r\nopportunity for observing, examine—\r\n\r\n1. The soil and subsoil of blighted trees?\r\n\r\n2. The habit of the tree, as to rankness of growth?\r\n\r\n3. The character of the cultivation which has been employed?\r\n\r\n4. In short, the relative condition of orchards and trees which have\r\nescaped or been blighted, as to fineness and closeness, and health of\r\ntexture. It is high time that this matter should be minutely\r\ninvestigated. It is the _opprobrium cultorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLES FOR HOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers are afraid of sour apples; if stock have _only_ sour fruit\r\nthey are injured; but let both sweet and sour grow in the orchard, and\r\nexperience has determined that they will, of themselves, eat the due\r\nproportion of each. Cattle and hogs are as fond of variety in fruit as\r\nmen are. In raising potatoes, pumpkins, apples, etc., for animals, it\r\nis frequently supposed that the larger and ranker the growth the\r\nbetter; that, at any rate, cattle fare as well on coarse-grained\r\nvegetables as on others. But a rank, coarse, watery vegetable is no\r\nbetter for an ox than for a man. The nutritious principle is the same\r\nto man or beast. A fine-fleshed, highly nutritious apple or potato is\r\nas much better for stock as it is for man. If a variety is not fit for\r\nmen, it is not worth while to cultivate it at all. Cattle show\r\nthemselves to be of this opinion when left to range; they avoid\r\ncoarse, rough herbage, and pick the sweetest and highest flavored. Let\r\nthe _best_ sorts of apples be planted for stock. If one has a seedling\r\norchard which it would be worth while to graft over for human use, let\r\nnot its poor, miserable fruit be fed to hogs; let it be grafted over\r\neven if one means to use it for stock.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPULLING OFF POTATO FLOWERS.—The man who makes his potato-ground feed\r\nflowers, prevents it feeding his children. Every ounce of matter\r\nconsumed by the flowers is so much taken from the consumption of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTo restore an exhausted, or rather tired field, it should be sown in\r\ngrass, and stock fed upon it during the winter months. Hogs fattened\r\nupon tired land enrich it very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLOWER GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING FLOWERING BULBS.—When crocus, hyacinths, narcissus, tulips,\r\nhave done flowering, let the seed stalks be cut down, as the ripening\r\nof the seed severely taxes and exhausts the powers of a plant. Some\r\npersons are accustomed, after the bulbs have flowered, to cut off the\r\ntops, as if to do the most mischief possible. The success of the next\r\nyear’s flowering will depend very much on the care given to your beds\r\nnow. Many bulbs, as the tulip, form entirely new bulbs; and others, as\r\nthe hyacinth, form the flower bud for the next season. The _leaf_ is\r\nthe indispensable means of doing this; in it are perfected the juices\r\nwhich are returned and deposited in the root. If the bed is left to be\r\nchoked with weeds, and your bulbs robbed of nutriment, or if the soil\r\nis left compact, or if there is too much moisture, or on the other\r\nhand, too little, the bud or bulb for the next year will be weakened.\r\nA very deep bed, or a sandy soil, will sufficiently prevent the\r\neffects of too much water.\r\n\r\nThe surface should be mellowed by the hand, and thoroughly weeded. The\r\n_most_ careful cultivators raise their bulbs every year. The _careful_\r\nat least every third year. The _careless_ let them alone and wonder,\r\nfrom year to year, why their bulbs do so poorly—“The moles must eat\r\nthem, or, worms probably injure them;” but the worst worm in a\r\nflower-garden is careless indolence. When bulbs are raised, it should\r\nnot be done until the leaves are dry.\r\n\r\nGLADIOLUS.—We are surprised that this fine soldier-like plant is not\r\nmore extensively employed to adorn gardens, yards, and lawns. A few\r\nvarieties only are found in our gardens. Great attention has been\r\ngiven in Europe, especially in Belgium, to raising new varieties, and\r\nmany magnificent kinds are now found in European collections which, so\r\nfar as we know, are not to be had for love or money in America. The\r\nbulb, or rather corm,[17] increases very rapidly, and by a little\r\nattention one may obtain from a few, a very large supply. They may be\r\nplanted with good effect in rows, in clumps, and in beds, but not\r\nsingly. A sandy loam, well mixed with leaf-mold, is their delight. We\r\nusually remove the top soil, and then take out and reject about twelve\r\ninches of the subsoil, making in all about twenty inches depth; return\r\nthe top earth, together with enough compost of leaf-mold, sand, and\r\nthoroughly decayed manure, to fill it; plant about four inches deep,\r\nmeasuring from the top of the corm. When your plants are growing,\r\nexamine every day; if you see a sawdust-like matter about them, they\r\nneed attention. On searching, a perforation will be found in the stem.\r\nWith a penknife slit the stem down from the hole until you reach the\r\nworm which caused the mischief. If this course is not properly\r\npursued, you will lose stem and root. With a thin strip of bass\r\nmatting, or a bit of green ribbon, the stem may be tied and fastened\r\nto a rod for support. In door-yards, and in the scanty grounds of city\r\nyards, clumps of ten or fifteen gladioli would have a very beautiful\r\nappearance, especially if different varieties, instead of being mixed,\r\nshould be planted in separate but contiguous patches.\r\n\r\nTUBEROSE.—The beauty of its pure, white florets, but especially the\r\ndelightful odor of this fragrant flower, has rendered it a favorite\r\nwherever it is known. It is very tender to frost, and must not be\r\nplanted out until about the first of May. It is to be treated like the\r\ngladiolus. Its effect is heightened by being put in a half shade,\r\nwhere its pure white is relieved by a green background. The flower\r\nstem rises from two to three feet and requires a rod to sustain it.\r\nThe fragrance is so powerful that a few plants will, at evening, scent\r\na whole garden; a circumstance well known to owners of pleasure\r\ngardens, who render their grounds very delightful by dispersing these,\r\nand other odoriferous flowers, in various parts of their grounds, thus\r\nloading the dewy evening air with delicious perfume. They may be\r\nplanted in tea-inch pots and sunk in the ground until they have begun\r\nto blossom, when the pots may be raised and conveyed to the parlor or\r\nveranda. A single plant will sometimes make a room disagreeable by its\r\nexcessive odor.\r\n\r\nThe roots are imported to England from Italy, as that climate is too\r\nhumid and cool too perfect them for flowering. But, in our soil and\r\nclimate, we have found no difficulty in raising, from off-sets, the\r\nfinest possible bulbs. No yard or garden should be without tuberoses.\r\n\r\nPLANTS IN POTS.—It is better when one has ground at hand, to turn out\r\nplants which have been housed through the winter into the open garden.\r\nRoses, geraniums, azaleas, cape jasmins, fuchsias, etc., will be\r\nwonderfully invigorated by such treatment. The tea and Bengal roses\r\ncan hardly be brought to perfection in pots, and those who have only\r\nseen the penurious growth and diminished and sparse blossoms in the\r\nparlor have no idea of the beauty of these roses. We usually excavate\r\na place two feet square and two feet deep for each rose, filling it\r\nwith sandy loam very highly enriched with leaf-mold and decayed\r\nmanure. The trouble will be repaid four fold; for nature has never\r\nmade a plant that forgets to be grateful for attention.\r\n\r\nIn turning out plants, put the left hand in such a way upon the top as\r\nthat the stem shall come between the second and third finger, then\r\ninvert the pot and give the bottom of it two or three sharp raps, when\r\nthe pot will come off. If the plant is in a lively, growing state, and\r\nthe outside of the ball of earth is covered with fine, white, new\r\nroots, it will be best to put the ball into the ground without\r\ndisturbing the roots at all. But if the plant is not growing, the\r\nearth may be carefully worked out from the roots with the hands,\r\ntaking care to break the fibres as little as possible. Spread out the\r\nroots as much as possible in every direction, and cover with fine\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nRose bushes will need attention soon, as worms and bugs begin their\r\ndepredations. When the number of bushes is limited, hand-picking every\r\nday or two is best. For a large collection one must resort to more\r\ngeneral methods. Drench your shrubs, which aphides and worms infest,\r\nwith soapsuds, made of two pounds of _whale-oil_ soap to fifteen\r\ngallons of water. This is by far the most efficacious—the only\r\nefficacious—course for destroying insects.\r\n\r\nAs flower-seeds come up, see that they are well weeded, and if\r\ncrowded, thin them out. We would recommend the cultivation of some\r\nold-fashioned flowers. Nothing is more showy than a bed of poppies of\r\nmixed colors. Holyhocks are becoming very great favorites, and we saw\r\nrecently flowers as magnificent, and as well worth having, as any\r\ndahlia. The varieties of lupine should be sought for, and for those\r\nwho have seen nothing but the white and blue lupines we make an\r\nextract from Mrs. Loudon’s “Companion to the Flower Garden”—an\r\nadmirable work, which, though professedly written for ladies, may be\r\nused with profit by everybody who cultivates a garden.\r\n\r\n“LUPINUS.—_Leguminosæ._—The Lupine. A genus of herbaceous annuals and\r\nperennials which contain some of our most beautiful border flowers:\r\nyellow, blue, white, and pink lupines are among the oldest border\r\nannuals; _L. nanus_ is a beautiful little annual, with dark blue\r\nflowers, a native of California, and requiring the usual treatment of\r\nCalifornia annuals. _L. mutabilis_ and _Cruicshankii_ are splendid\r\nplants, growing to the height of four or five feet, and branching like\r\nminiature trees. _L. Polyphyllus_ and its varieties are perennials,\r\nand they are splendid and vigorous-growing plants, with spikes of\r\nflowers from one foot to eighteen inches in length; _L. nootkatensis_\r\nis a handsome dwarf perennial, and _L. arboreus_, when trained against\r\na wall, will attain six feet in height, and in sheltered situations it\r\nwill grow with equal vigor trained as a bush tied to a stake; _L.\r\nlatifolius_ is a perennial from California, with very long spikes of\r\nblue flowers. All the species will thrive in common garden soil; the\r\nannuals are propagated by seed sown in February or March, and the\r\nperennials by division of the roots.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     [17] Bulbs are of two kinds: those which have a number of\r\n     coats, or skins, one within the other, like the hyacinth,\r\n     which are called tunicated bulbs; those which consist of a\r\n     number of scales, only attached to the base, like the lily;\r\n     but what are called corms, are only a solid mass of feculent\r\n     matter, and which modern botanists do not allow to be bulbs,\r\n     but call underground stems. Corms do not require taking up\r\n     so often as bulbs; and when they are intended to remain for\r\n     several years in the ground, they should be planted from\r\n     four to six inches deep at first; as every year a new corm\r\n     will form above the old one; and thus, if planted too near\r\n     the surface, the corm, in a few years, will be pushed out of\r\n     the ground.—_Loudon._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF SEED FOR SOWING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany persons suppose that when seeds have been selected, nothing is\r\nnecessary but to put them into the ground just as they are. A careful\r\npreparation of seed, both for field or garden use, will add much to\r\nthe success of a planting.\r\n\r\n1. ASSORTING SEEDS.—In every lot of seed there are many imperfect\r\nones; some are insectiferous, some are unripe, some are the extreme\r\nterminal seeds, small and weak, some are very often a little moldy. In\r\nsome way all defective seeds should be removed.\r\n\r\nThen it should be remembered, that the soundest and largest seeds will\r\nproduce plants of a corresponding vigor, and that by planting only the\r\nhealthiest, the variety is kept pure—or even improved.\r\n\r\nFor garden use hand picking will suffice. We pour our corn on a table,\r\nand select only the kernels which are plump and large, rejecting any\r\nwhich show an intermixture of other varieties. Beet seed requires\r\ncareful winnowing, nearly one-fourth, as they are usually sold, being\r\nunfit for planting. Peas are more uniform in size and quality, and\r\nrequire but little selection. Melons, squashes, and cucumbers should\r\nbe culled, or better yet, be put into water; only those which sink\r\npromptly should be used, the swimming and floating ones being light\r\nand trashy. Beans are apt to be imperfect. We have usually found\r\noccasion to reject full one-third of every quart, for seedsmen are apt\r\nto put in every seed that grows, whether they will ever grow again or\r\nnot. There is no dishonesty certainly in this; but if one would\r\nhabitually screen or select, and put, up only the very choicest, he\r\nwould ultimately get a higher price, and secure for his seed a\r\nuniversal demand.\r\n\r\n2. SOAKING SEEDS.—Some seeds will not germinate for a long period,\r\nunless they are artificially brought forward. Locust seeds are\r\n_scalded_ before planting. Peas are scalded to kill the bug, when thus\r\ninhabited. The cypress vine seed require soaking to induce a quick\r\ngermination. Celery seed is very sluggish unless soaked.\r\n\r\nSeeds are often steeped in _prepared_ liquids to force their growth.\r\nOld seeds, whose powers of germination are much diminished, are made\r\nto vegetate by being put into a weak solution of oxalic acid. Wheat is\r\n_pickled_ in salt brine, then rolled in lime, as a preventive of\r\n_smut_.\r\n\r\nCorn is protected from worms by copperas water; and peas are put into\r\ntrain oil to guard them from moles and mice. Tanner’s oil, and a\r\nsolution of saltpetre are often used; the first for turnip-seed, to\r\nprotect them from a destructive insect; and the latter for all seeds,\r\nas a stimulant to their growth and to guard against worms and bugs.\r\n\r\nSome excitement was made in Scotland, not long ago, by the great\r\neffects alleged to have been produced by so preparing seeds that they\r\nwould contain in or on themselves all those fertilizing qualities\r\nusually looked for in the soil. It is possible, by employing chemical\r\nmixtures, or coatings, to make the seed germinate with great vigor,\r\nand to establish itself strongly; but we do not suppose any process\r\ncan be made to reach beyond this. No mere soaking or coating can\r\nextend its influence through the whole growth of the crop.\r\n\r\nWhen seeds are soaked they anticipate the weeds in coming up,\r\nespecially seeds planted in May and June, and this is a very important\r\nobject, as crops are, often, almost smothered with weeds before they\r\nare large enough to be weeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOWING FLOWER SEEDS—TRANSPLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany flower-seeds require no more skill in planting than do peas or\r\nbeans, for they are as large and as easily germinated. But very many\r\nare small, and some extremely small, and if planted too deeply, they\r\nwill not shoot, or will shoot very feebly.\r\n\r\nSelect a free-working and rich piece of ground—a sandy loam is best,\r\nand a stiff clay the worst—let it be spaded deeply, incorporating very\r\nthoroughly-rotted manure, _i. e._ manure full two years old and which\r\nwill crumble in the hand as fine as sand. With a fine-toothed rake\r\nreduce every lump and bring the surface to the finest state of\r\npulverization. If the seed is very small, it had better be mixed with\r\na little sand, or dry soil, to increase the bulk. The sowing will be\r\neasier and more equal. Scatter the seed upon the bed; then with the\r\nhands or a fine garden sieve, sift fresh and mellow earth upon it from\r\na quarter to half an inch in depth. To bring the earth compactly about\r\nthe seed, spat the bed with moderate strokes with the back of a spade.\r\nIf the weather is very dry, water the bed at evening with a\r\nwatering-pot—to pour it from a pail or cup would wash up the surface.\r\nKeep the plants from weeds, and when they are one or two inches high,\r\nthey may be transplanted to the places where they are to stand.\r\nBalsams, larkspurs, poppies, and, indeed, most flowers do better by\r\nbeing transplanted. The operation checks the luxuriance of the plant,\r\nand increases its tendency to flower.\r\n\r\nSometimes seeds are planted where they are to remain; the treatment is\r\nprecisely the same as before, except they are _thinned out_ instead of\r\ntransplanted. No mistake is more frequent, among inexperienced\r\ngardeners, than that of suffering too many plants to stand together.\r\nOne is reluctant to pull up fine thriving plants; or he does not\r\nreflect that what may seem room enough while the plant is young, will\r\nbe very scanty when it is grown.\r\n\r\nThere is much taste to be displayed in arranging flowers in a garden\r\nso that proper colors shall be contrasted. It is important that proper\r\ncolors should be matched in a garden, as on a dress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLOR PLANTS AND FLOWERS IN WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treatment of house plants is very little understood, although the\r\npractice of keeping shrubs and flowers during the winter is almost\r\nuniversal. It is important that the physiological principles on which\r\nsuccess depends should be familiarly understood; and then cultivators\r\ncan apply them with success in all the varying circumstances in which\r\nthey may be called to act.\r\n\r\nTwo objects are proposed in taking plants into the house—either simple\r\nprotection, or the development of their foliage and flowers, during\r\nthe winter. The same treatment will not do for both objects. Indeed,\r\nthe greatest number of persons of our acquaintance, treat their winter\r\nplants, from which they desire flowers, as if they only wished to\r\npreserve them till spring; and the consequence is, that they have very\r\nlittle enjoyment in their favorites.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE PLANTS DESIGNED SIMPLY TO STAND OVER.\r\n\r\nTender roses, azaleas, cape jasmins, crape myrtles, oranges, lemons,\r\nfigs, oleanders, may be kept in a _light_ cellar if frost never\r\npenetrates it.\r\n\r\nIf kept in parlors, the following are the most essential points to be\r\nobserved. The thermometer should never be permitted to rise above\r\nsixty degrees or sixty-five degrees; nor at night to sink below forty\r\ndegrees. Although plants will not be frost-bitten until the mercury\r\nfalls to thirty-two degrees, yet the chill of a temperature below\r\nforty degrees will often be as mischievous to tender plants as frost\r\nitself. Excessive heat, particularly a dry stove heat, will destroy\r\nthe leaves almost as certainly as frost. We have seen plants\r\nlanguishing in a temperature of seventy degrees (it often rising ten\r\ndegrees higher), while the owners wondered what could ail the plants,\r\nfor they were sure that they kept the room warm enough!\r\n\r\nNext, great care should be taken not to overwater. Plants which are\r\nnot growing require _very little_ water. If given, the roots become\r\nsogged, or rotten, and the whole plant is enfeebled. Water should\r\nnever be suffered to stand in the saucers; nor be given, always, when\r\nthe top-soil is dry. Let the earth be stirred, and when the _interior_\r\nof the ball is becoming dry, give it a _copious_ supply; let it drain\r\nthrough thoroughly, and turn off what falls into the saucer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS DESIGNED FOR WINTER FLOWERING.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that the winter is naturally the season of\r\n_rest_ for plants. All plants require to lie dormant during some\r\nportion of the year. You cannot cheat them out of it. If they are\r\npushed the whole year they become exhausted and worthless. Here lies\r\nthe most common error of plant-keepers. If you mean to have roses,\r\nblooming geraniums, etc., in winter, you must, _artificially, change\r\ntheir season of rest_. Plants which flower in summer must rest in\r\nwinter; those which are to flower in winter must rest either in summer\r\nor autumn. It is not, usually, worth while to take into the house for\r\nflowering purposes any shrub which has been in full bloom during the\r\nsummer or autumn. Select and pot the wished-for flowers during summer;\r\nplace them in a shaded position facing the north, give very little\r\nwater, and then keep them quiet. Their energies will thus be saved for\r\nwinter. When taken into the house, the four essential points of\r\nattention are light, moisture, temperature, and cleanliness.\r\n\r\n1. LIGHT.—The functions of the leaves cannot be healthfully carried on\r\nwithout light. If there be too little, the sap is imperfectly\r\nelaborated, and returns from the leaves to the body in a crude,\r\nundigested state. The growth will be coarse, watery, and brittle; and\r\nthat ripeness which must precede flowers and fruit cannot be attained.\r\nThe sprawling, spindling, white-colored, long-jointed, plants, of\r\nwhich some persons are unwisely proud, are, often the result of too\r\nlittle light and too much water. The pots should be turned around\r\nevery day, unless when the light strikes down from above, or from\r\nwindows on each side; otherwise, they will grow out of shape by\r\nbending toward the light.\r\n\r\n2. MOISTURE.—Different species of plants require different quantities\r\nof water. What are termed _aquatics_, of which the _Calla Æthiopica_,\r\nis a specimen, require great abundance of it. Yet it should be often\r\n_changed_ even in the case of aquatics. But roses, geraniums, etc.,\r\nand the common house plants require the soil to be _moist_, rather\r\nthan _wet_. As a general rule it may be said that every pot should\r\nhave one-sixth part of its depth filled with coarse pebbles, as a\r\ndrainage, before the plants are potted. This gives all superfluous\r\nmoisture a free passage out. Plants should be watered by _examination_\r\nand not by _time_. They require various quantities of moisture,\r\naccording to their activity, and the period of their growth. Let the\r\nearth be well stirred, and if it is becoming dry on the inside, give\r\nwater. Never water by _dribblets_—a spoonful to-day, another\r\nto-morrow. In this way the outside will become bound, and the inside\r\nremain dry. Give a copious watering, so that the whole ball shall be\r\nsoaked; then let it drain off, and that which comes into the saucer be\r\npoured off. But, in whatever way one prefers to give water, the thing\r\nto be gained is a full supply of moisture to every part of the roots,\r\nand yet not so much as to have it _stand_ about them. Manure-water may\r\nbe employed with great benefit every second or third watering. For\r\nthis purpose we have never found anything of value equal to _guano_.\r\nBesides water to the root, plants are almost as much benefited by\r\nwater on the leaf—but of this we shall speak under the head of\r\n_cleanliness_.\r\n\r\n3. TEMPERATURE.—Sudden and violent _changes_ of temperature are almost\r\nas trying to plants as to animals and men. At the same time, a\r\nmoderate change of temperature is very desirable. Thus, in nature,\r\nthere is a marked and uniform variation at night from the temperature\r\nof the day. At night, the room should be gradually lowered in\r\ntemperature to from forty-five degrees to fifty degrees, while through\r\nthe day it ranges from fifty-five degrees to seventy degrees. Too\r\nmuch, and too sudden heat will destroy tender leaves almost as surely\r\nas frost. It should also be remembered that the leaves of plants are\r\nconstantly exhaling moisture during the day. If in too warm an\r\natmosphere, or in one which is too dry, this perspiration becomes\r\nexcessive and weakens the plant. If the room be stove-heated, a basin\r\nof water should be put on the stove to supply moisture to the air by\r\nevaporation. Sprinkling the leaves, a kind of artificial dew, is also\r\nbeneficial, on this account. The air should be changed as often as\r\npossible. Every warm and sunny day should be improved to let in fresh\r\nair upon these vegetable breathers.\r\n\r\n4. CLEANLINESS.—This is important element of health as well as of\r\nbeauty. _Animal-uncleanliness_ is first to be removed. If ground-worms\r\nhave been incorporated with the dirt, give a dose or two of lime-water\r\nto the soil. Next aphides or green-lice will appear upon the leaves\r\nand stems. Tobacco smoke will soon stupefy them and cause them to\r\ntumble upon the shelves or surface of the soil, whence they are to be\r\ncarefully brushed, or crushed. If one has but a few plants, put them\r\nin a group on the floor; put four chairs around them, and cover with\r\nan old blanket, forming a sort of tent. Set a dish of coals within,\r\nand throw on a handful of tobacco leaves. Fifteen minutes’ smoking\r\nwill destroy any decent aphis.\r\n\r\nIf a larger collection is on hand, let the dish or dishes be placed\r\nunder the stands. When the destruction is completed, let the parlor be\r\nwell ventilated, unless, fair lady, you have an inveterate smoker for\r\na husband; in which case you may have become used to the nuisance.\r\n\r\nThe insects which infest large collections of green-houses, are fully\r\ntreated of in horticultural books of directions.\r\n\r\n_Dust_ will settle every day upon the leaves, and choke up the\r\nperspiring pores. The leaves should be kept free by gentle wiping, or\r\nby washing.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhite Clover is an important grass on flourishing old meadows. It\r\ngrows very thick at the bottom of the other grass, although in a good\r\nseason it will grow to the height of from twelve to sixteen inches. I\r\nhave seen it in low spots completely covered for weeks together.\r\nTherefore land which produces abundant crops of grass, would require\r\nextensive draining for grain, and seeing that plowing such land\r\ndestroys its life, it is far better to keep it in grass continually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLOR FLOWERS AND PLANTS IN WINTER.—(_Art. 2._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so few who care enough for flowers to trouble themselves\r\nwith them during the winter, that it seems almost unkind to criticise\r\nthe imperfections of those who do. But it is very plain that, for the\r\nmost part, skill and knowledge do not keep pace with good taste. _Not_\r\nto point out defects to those who are anxious to improve would be the\r\nreal unkindness.\r\n\r\nThere are two objects for which plants are kept over.\r\n\r\nPlants are housed for the sake of their verdure and bloom during the\r\nwinter; or, simply to protect them from the frosts. Our first\r\ncriticism is, that these two separate objects are, to a great extent,\r\nimproperly united. Tables and window-stands are crowded with plants\r\nwhich ought to be in the cellar or in a pit. Plants which have bloomed\r\nthrough the summer _will_ rest during the winter. To remove them from\r\nthe heat and dust of the parlor—to place them in a dry, light, warm\r\ncellar, will certainly conduce to their entire rest, and the parlor\r\nwill lose no grace by the removal of ragged stems, falling leaves, and\r\nflowerless branches. When a large quantity of plants are to be\r\nprotected, and cellar room is wanting, a pit may be prepared with\r\nlittle expense. Dig a place eight or ten feet square, in a dry\r\nexposure. The depth may be from five to six feet. Let the surface of\r\nthis chamber be curbed about with a plank frame, the top of which\r\nshould slope to the south at an inclination of about three inches to\r\nthe foot. This may be covered with plank except in the middle, where\r\ntwo sash may be placed. The outside of the plank may be banked up with\r\nearth, and if light brush or haulm be placed upon the top, in severe\r\nweather, it will be all the better. The inside may be provided with\r\nshelves on every side for the pots, and thus hundreds of plants may be\r\neffectually protected. During severe freezing weather the sash should\r\nbe covered with mats, old carpet, straw or anything of the kind; and\r\nin _very_ cold weather this should not be removed during the daytime:\r\nfor if the plants have been touched with frost, the admission of light\r\nwill destroy or maim them, whereas, if kept in darkness, they will\r\nsuffer little or no injury. Several families may unite in the expense\r\nof forming a cold-pit and thus fill it with plants at a small expense\r\nand very little inconvenience to each. _Very little_ if any water\r\nshould be given to plants thus at rest.\r\n\r\nEven where plants are wanted to bloom in the parlor late in the\r\nwinter, it is often better to let them spend the fore-part of the\r\nwinter in the cellar or pit.\r\n\r\nOur second criticism respects the _character_ of winter collections.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable error is the strange crowd of plants often huddled\r\ntogether, as if the excellence of a collection consisted in the number\r\nof things brought together. Everything that the florist sees in other\r\ncollections has been procured, as if it would be an unpardonable\r\nnegligence not to have what others have. Hence we sometimes see scores\r\nof plants, very different in their habits, requiring widely different\r\nconditions of growth, reduced to one regimen, viz. a place near the\r\nwindow, so much water a day, and one turning round. This summary\r\nprocedure, of course, soon results in a vegetable Falstaff’s regiment;\r\nsome plants being long, sprawling, gangling, some dormant and dumpy;\r\nsome shedding their leaves and going to rest with unripe wood, some\r\nmildewed, a few faintly struggling to show here and there a bewildered\r\nblossom. In such a collection the eye is pained by the entire want of\r\nsympathy arising from jumbling together the most dissimilar kinds;\r\nfrom the want of robust health, and from the entire disappearance of\r\nthat vivid freshness and sprightliness of growth, compact while it is\r\nrapid, which gives a charm to well managed plants.\r\n\r\nAll plants which are not growing, or for whose growth your parlors are\r\nnot suitable, should be put into the cellar and should there be\r\nallowed to stand over in a state of rest. According to your\r\naccommodations, select a _few_ vigorous, symmetrical, hearty, healthy\r\nplants for the window. _One plant_ well tended, will afford you more\r\npleasure than twenty, half-nurtured.\r\n\r\nIn our dwellings, one has to make his way between two extremes in the\r\nbest manner that he can. Without a stove our thin-walled houses are\r\ncold as an ice-house, and a frosty night sends sad dismay among our\r\nfavorites. Then, on the other hand, if we have a stove, the air is apt\r\nto be parched, and unwholesome, fit for salamanders, fat and torpid\r\ncats and dozing grandmothers. There is not much choice between an\r\nice-house and an oven. _There can be no such thing as floral health\r\nwithout fresh air and enough of it._ This must be procured by frequent\r\nventilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTING PLANTS IN WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery many shrubs, vines, roses, etc., usually regarded as tender, may\r\nyet be safely left standing in the garden if properly protected.\r\n\r\n_The neck of plants_, _i. e._ that part at which the roots and stem\r\ncome together, requires thorough protection; both because it is the\r\nmost tender (as some say), and because it is at this point, that\r\nfreezing and sudden thawing must occur. The black soil absorbing heat\r\nrapidly, the neck of a plant will be first and most affected by the\r\nmorning sun; and this is the reason, we think, rather than any special\r\ntenderness of parts, why plants are killed at the crown of the root.\r\nLet the ground be well covered with leaves or with coarse manure, and\r\nlet it come up three or four inches high on the stem. It is better to\r\nhave the top strawy, rather than dark colored manure.\r\n\r\n_It is the sun_, and not the frost, that, for the most part, kills the\r\nstems of half-hardy plants. Protection is often, therefore, only\r\nthorough shading. The Bengal tea, and noisette roses are left out at\r\nPhiladelphia and at Cincinnati without detriment.\r\n\r\nDrive a stake by the side of the plant, and drawing up the branches to\r\nit, cover them with straw, or bass-matting wrapped around them. Kegs,\r\nbarrels, boxes, etc., may be turned over such as are not too high and\r\nwill sufficiently protect them. Air-holes should be bored in barrels,\r\netc., and the north side is the best for the purpose.\r\n\r\n_Grape vines_ which need protection should be loosened from the\r\ntrellis or wall, pruned, laid down on the ground and earth thrown over\r\nthem three or four inches deep. Isabella and Catawba grape vines will\r\nneed no protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE DAHLIA ROOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe least frost destroys these roots. In warm and damp cellars they\r\nrot. Very many persons have no cellars at all (a very frequent\r\ndestitution at the West); others are so small and moist, as to be\r\nunfit (our own, for instance); and the extreme variations of\r\ntemperature during the day and night make sitting-rooms and their\r\nclosets very unsafe places for them. The labor of packing them in sand\r\nis not great to those who have it ready or men to procure it; but to\r\nladies, and especially to many in towns and cities who are\r\nenthusiastic cultivators of flowers, but grievously vexed with poverty\r\nof pocket, this plan is inconvenient.\r\n\r\nWhy may not dahlias be kept in the soil? We think there is not the\r\nleast doubt that they can be protected from _frost_ and _heat_. Every\r\none knows that in spading up in the spring the dahlia beds of the\r\nprevious year, large sections of the tubers, which had broken off when\r\nthe main roots were removed, are found in a fresh and sound condition.\r\n\r\nLet a pit be dug say two feet deep, the roots carefully disposed in\r\nit, covered with soil, and the whole protected by coarse litter,\r\nstraw, etc. We do not advise any to adventure their whole stock in\r\nthis manner; but we design to select the inferior sorts from our stock\r\nand treat them thus; and if successful, we shall, another year, try\r\nour whole stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Where a hedge is properly made and carefully trimmed, it is the\r\nmost beautiful fence that can be made; and, as an _object of beauty_,\r\nit may be well to form hedges in a wood country; but as a mode of\r\ngeneral fencing we deem it totally inappropriate to the condition of a\r\ncountry abounding in timber. The labor of setting and tending it until\r\nit is established, is tenfold more than is required for a timber\r\nfence; a hedge requires from five to eight years for its\r\nestablishment; and every year of this time it must be _well_ tended;\r\nwhen grown, it requires annual shearing; which, on a long line of\r\nfence, is a labor to which few farmers will submit for the sake of\r\n_appearances_. It is liable to get out of order by disease, or the\r\ndeath of particular parts; and, if neglected a few years, it becomes\r\nragged, a covert for vermin and mischievous animals. In yards,\r\ngardens, and lawns, hedges should be grown for ornament, and to serve\r\nas screens, and backgrounds.\r\n\r\nUpon the estates of the affluent where money is less valuable to the\r\nowner than decorations, hedges should be established. Hedges may also\r\nbe economical in a prairie country; the labor and expense of making\r\nand keeping may be less than would be the cost of timber; but on farms\r\nin a woodland district they are to be regarded as a _luxury_; and like\r\nall luxuries, they are expensive.\r\n\r\n2. The white thorn will do very well for hedges if carefully tended.\r\nThe usual materials for hedges, at the East, are the English white\r\nthorn (_cratægus oxycantha_), the buckthorn (_rhamnus catharticus_),\r\nNewcastle thorn (_cratægas crus-galli_), honey locust (_gleditschia\r\ntriacanthos_), red cedar (_juniperus Virginiana_), the Washington or\r\nVirginia thorn (_cratægus cordata_).\r\n\r\nThe Osage orange (_maclura aurantiaca_) has been highly recommended;\r\nit is eminently beautiful, and if proved to be good for hedging,\r\nshould be employed. Privet makes a sightly hedge, but is thornless.\r\nThe Washington thorn is employed in this neighborhood by Aaron\r\nAldredge; it is very beautiful; will require eight or ten years to\r\ngive it maturity.\r\n\r\n3. When the thorn is used, the berries should be gathered and mashed,\r\nin the fall, and the seed exposed, mixed with moist sand, to the frost\r\nof winter. In the spring they should be sown in nursery rows, and at a\r\nyear old, they should be transplanted. A reserve of plants should be\r\nkept in the nursery to supply vacancies which may occur.\r\n\r\nThe ground should be thoroughly and deeply pulverized by plowing\r\n(spading would be much better) and the plants set about six inches\r\napart. The ground should be kept entirely free from weeds; this may be\r\ndone in a profitable manner by planting bush beans on each side, the\r\ntending of which will keep the hedge clean, the ground mellow, besides\r\nthe profit of the crop. Dr. Shurtliff, of Boston, gives the following\r\nbrief but excellent directions:\r\n\r\n“Prepare your land in the best manner; use suitable plants of thrifty\r\ngrowth, the older the better; assort and accommodate to the different\r\nkinds of soil; preserve all the roots, but crop the tops, leaving only\r\nfew buds; keep a few in your nursery; set them sloping to the north,\r\nand leave the ground a little concave about the roots; keep them clear\r\nof grass and weeds, and add a little earth to the roots at each\r\nhoeing; clear away the leaves at autumn; trim the side branches\r\ncarefully, and leave the main stems to nature till they are six feet\r\nhigh, then crop of the tops to the height you mean to have your hedge.\r\nIt will look like a wedge with the sharp end upwards, and will exhibit\r\na most beautiful appearance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERING TREES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have observed many persons copiously watering young trees and\r\ngarden plants.\r\n\r\n1. In many cases much water is a positive injury. The roots draw up a\r\nlarger supply of liquid than there is vigor in the tree to digest or\r\nappropriate. In such cases the tissue is enfeebled, the roots decay,\r\nand the tree perishes in the trying heats of July and August.\r\n\r\n2. It often happens that wetting the tree itself is much better than\r\nwatering the root. Take a watering-pot and drench the leaves, and\r\nlimbs and trunk, several times in a day. In a small tree a large bunch\r\nof cotton or rags may be put in the crotch and saturated with water.\r\nIt will gradually trickle down the stem, and also evaporate, keeping\r\nthe leaves in a moist medium. This trouble is worth while in case of\r\nrare trees difficult to be obtained. A tree perspires as really as an\r\nanimal or a man. Every leaf is furnished with _stomata_ or pores, the\r\nnumber and size of which determine the amount of perspiration. Of\r\ncourse, as they vary in different plants, there is a corresponding\r\ndifference in the amount which they perspire. Plants which grow in\r\nexposed situations, scorched by the sun, have a structure which admits\r\nbut slight perspiration, while those which grow in the shade and in\r\nmoist places perspire copiously.\r\n\r\nIt is upon this state of facts that watering the tree itself is\r\nbeneficial. The exhalation from the leaf is diminished, and sap\r\nretained within the tree. Beside this, the leaf and young green bark\r\nabsorb some moisture.\r\n\r\n3. Where watering is resorted to it should not be upon the surface;\r\nespecially is this injurious in clay soils. The moisture is\r\nimmediately exhaled, and the sun hardens the wet earth into a crust,\r\nnearly as impervious to light, and air and moisture, as if it were\r\nsheet-iron. Let a slight trench be opened, and after the water has\r\nsunk away, replace the earth and pulverize it. In this way no baking\r\nwill take place.\r\n\r\n4. But the best method of watering by the root, is that which is\r\ntechnically denominated _mulching_. Cover the surface of the ground\r\nbeneath the tree or shrub with three or four inches’ thickness of\r\ncoarse, strawy manure. If watered through this the earth will not\r\nbake; the moisture will not evaporate; the root will be shielded from\r\nthe sun, and enriched by the infiltration of the juices of the manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLABELS FOR TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of _great_ importance for every farmer to preserve the names of\r\nhis fruit-trees; and no amateur cultivator should think himself worthy\r\nof a name whose garden and fruit ground is not registered and\r\nlabelled.\r\n\r\nIt is best in every case to have a fruit-book, in which should be\r\nentered the name of each tree, its place, time of planting, from whom\r\nobtained, how old it was from the graft or bud, when set out, its\r\nsize, condition, etc.\r\n\r\nSuch a book, kept in the house, is a sure and permanent record of the\r\nnames of your fruit-trees. Beside this, each tree should have a\r\n_label_ attached to it. For, in passing through an orchard or fruit\r\ngarden, it is desirable to know the names of trees without the\r\ninconvenience of carrying your book under your arm. The labels are for\r\ndaily use; the book keeps a permanent record, so that if a label be\r\nlost the name of the tree does not go with it. It is quite provoking\r\nto examine a friend’s premises without being able to learn the name of\r\na single tree. Beside, every cultivator should know the names of his\r\ntrees as well as of his cattle; otherwise they will get local names,\r\nand the same fruit have a new name in each orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING EVERGREENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general impression that evergreens are very difficult to\r\ntransplant is not well founded if one will observe a few directions.\r\n\r\n_The best time for transplanting_ is when the tips begin to show fresh\r\ngrowth in spring. This is exactly the reverse of directions in English\r\nbooks, which denounce spring, and enjoin fall transplanting—in the\r\nclimate of England, doubtless with good reason; and it is a good\r\nillustration of the caution necessary before imitating, in our\r\nclimate, the most skillful foreign practices.\r\n\r\nA friend informs us that he has always totally lost all his fall\r\ntransplantings; not saving ten in a hundred; and other men say they\r\nhave had similar experience, and _it is a settled fact that fall\r\ntransplanting of evergreens is bad practice_.\r\n\r\n_The best method_ of removing is to lift the plant with as many roots\r\nand fibres as possible. More care should be used in this respect than\r\nin the removal of fruit-trees; indeed, there is little risk when good\r\nroots are obtained and kept in a moist condition. In planting, the\r\nmost successful operators that we have seen, mix about half and half\r\ncommon soil and old rotten wood from the forests, filling it in\r\ncarefully about the roots and covering the surface with substances\r\nwhich will prevent too much evaporation of moisture, as litter,\r\ndecayed wood, sods grass side down, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe old wood employed should be thoroughly decomposed; and that of the\r\nhackberry, maple, and beech are preferred. The decayed wood of the\r\nblack walnut and oak do not seem congenial to plants.\r\n\r\nWhen large trees are to be removed it is often done with success in\r\nthe winter, by opening a trench about the tree and permitting the ball\r\nof earth to freeze pretty thoroughly. The tree is then undermined and\r\nupon a sledge easily removed to its destination. The hole for its\r\nreception should have been dug while the ground was unfrozen, and it\r\nwill be necessary to wait until it thaws before it can again be filled\r\nin about the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERS, LADIES, AND ANGELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf ladies wish to get into the very best company possible, we do not\r\nknow of any pleasanter way than is detailed in this beautiful scrap\r\nfrom a German poet:\r\n\r\n  A flower do but place near thy window glass,\r\n  And through it no image of evil shall pass.\r\n  Abroad must thou go? on thy white bosom wear\r\n  A nosegay, and doubt not an angel is there;\r\n  Forget not to water at break of the day\r\n  The lilies, and thou shalt be fairer than they;\r\n  Place a rose near thy bed nightly sentry to keep,\r\n  And angels shall rock thee on roses to sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd pray what will happen if a _gentleman_ does all this? For one, we\r\nhave a personal curiosity to know; for we do all these things and a\r\ngood many more. If any other angels have hovered about us than angelic\r\nflowers, we make an especial request to them not, hereafter, to be so\r\nshy about it. Our natural eye would delight to behold in veritable\r\nsubstance all the flower-spirits which our ideality spies lurking in\r\nour garden-blossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORTICULTURAL CURIOSITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hovey, editor of the magazine which bears his name, had occasion\r\nduring the year 1844 to visit Europe, for professional objects; “not\r\nthe least was that of giving some account of the condition of\r\ngardening in that country, from whose works, whose practice, and\r\nexperience, our own cultivators have derived so much knowledge.”\r\n\r\nWe cull from the several numbers already published in his magazine,\r\nthe most interesting facts.\r\n\r\nRHODODENDRONS.—Speaking of the Liverpool botanical gardens, he says:\r\n\r\n     “The principal clumps were filled with rhododendrons of\r\n     various kinds, which do remarkably well; the climate, from\r\n     its humidity, seems to suit them, and most of the plants\r\n     were clothed with branches from the base to the top. _R.\r\n     altaclerense_ we saw six feet high; how fine must be its\r\n     numerous clusters of splendid rosy blossoms! From the time\r\n     we entered this garden, where we first saw the rhododendrons\r\n     in abundance, until we returned home, we were constantly\r\n     impressed with the importance which this shrub is destined\r\n     to hold in our gardens. Although a native of our woods and\r\n     forests, it is scarcely known out of our native habitats;\r\n     yet abroad we see it the first ornament of the garden. By\r\n     hybridization, and the production of an immense number of\r\n     seedlings, during the last fifteen years, it has been\r\n     increased in splendor, until it now almost equals its\r\n     tender, but gorgeous eastern sisters. How long shall our\r\n     gardens be deficient in this great ornament?”\r\n\r\nFUCHSIAS, OR LADIES’ EARDROP.—Nothing will be more surprising to those\r\nwho have cultivated this beautiful plant, and thought it well grown if\r\na foot high, and brilliant if a dozen blossoms showed at once, than\r\nthe magnificent size and flowering of _Fuchsias_ as seen in England.\r\n\r\nAt the Sheffield Botanical Gardens Mr. Hovey saw the Fuchsias globosa\r\nmajor, upwards of _twenty feet_ high, the stem, at the base, being two\r\ninches through! Its drooping branches were clothed with thousands of\r\nflowers; another variety, “called _Youngii grandiflora_ was also\r\ntwenty feet high, and equally strong, with innumerable flowers: this\r\nplant was only seven years old. It is almost impossible for those who\r\nhave never seen specimens more than four or five feet high, to imagine\r\nthe great beauty of such gigantic plants; notwithstanding their size\r\nthey were well grown, being of symmetrical shape, and with vigorous\r\nand healthy foliage; they were planted in very large tubs, about two\r\nfeet deep and two feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n     “The splendid _F. fulgens_ and _corymbiflora_ we also saw\r\n     here upward of ten feet high, and full of their showy\r\n     flowers.”\r\n\r\nThe Regent’s Park Garden occasions the following remarks:\r\n\r\n     “_Fuchsia globosa_ was, perhaps, as beautiful as anything\r\n     which we saw for this subject. There is an opinion prevalent\r\n     that fuchsias in our climate do not do well in the open\r\n     border; but we suspect such an idea has been prematurely\r\n     formed without experience, for we recollect seeing in the\r\n     garden of Mr. Johnson, of Lynn, three years ago, plants,\r\n     which were then in profuse bloom, and had been so all\r\n     summer, turned out of the pots into the soil; the\r\n     probability is that the plants have not been abundant enough\r\n     to give a fair trial. As they are easily propagated, and may\r\n     be sold almost as cheap as verbenas, we hope to hear of\r\n     experiments being tried to test their capability of enduring\r\n     our warm sun.”\r\n\r\nAt Chiswick Mr. Hovey saw the original tree of Williams’ Bon Chrétien\r\npear (the Bartlett of Boston gardens). It was hale and healthy.\r\n\r\nTULIPS.—Mr. H. visited Mr. Groom, at Clapham; “preparations were\r\nmaking for planting out the great collection of tulips in October. For\r\nthis flower Mr. Groom is famous; he has raised several very splendid\r\nseedlings, some of which are priced as high as _five hundred dollars_,\r\nand a great number at _one hundred_ dollars each (£21 sterling). It\r\nwould seem to those who know little of the tulip that this was\r\nsomething of a tulip mania; but the tulip is a most gorgeous flower,\r\nand when once a love for it takes possession of the amateur, and he\r\nobtains a knowledge of its properties, there is scarce anything he\r\nwould not sacrifice to obtain the choicest kinds. In England, there\r\nare many collections valued at thousands of pounds. In this country\r\nthe tulip is but little valued, and a bed of the most common kind\r\nattracts nearly as many admirers as one of the choicest and\r\nhigh-priced flowers.”\r\n\r\nDWARF PEAR-TREES.—“The garden is laid out with numerous walks, and the\r\nborders of them were filled with bearing trees. They were from six to\r\nten feet high, trained in pyramidal form, and many of them full of\r\nfruit. This mode of growing trees appears to be universally adopted\r\naround Paris; we scarcely saw a standard tree. The advantages of the\r\npyramidal or quenouille form are, that, in gardens of moderate extent\r\nonly, a collection of two or three hundred kinds may be cultivated;\r\nthey occupy but little room, being placed about six feet apart, and\r\nbeing pruned in, they do not throw sufficient shade to injure anything\r\ngrowing near them. They afford greater facilities for examining the\r\nfruit while growing, and for picking it when ripe; the trees are not\r\nso much shaken by high winds, and the large kind of pears do not so\r\neasily blow off: the facilities for making observations upon the wood\r\nand leaves, are also greater; and, as regards appearance alone, they\r\nare, when well managed, far more beautiful than standards. To those\r\nwho wish to plant out large quantities for orchard cultivation, they\r\nwould not, of course, be recommended; but for the garden, the\r\npyramidal form should be adopted.”\r\n\r\nALPINE STRAWBERRY.—This variety is especially valuable from its\r\npropensity to bear all the summer. At the gardens of the Luxembourg,\r\nParis, Mr. Hovey says:\r\n\r\n     “The Alpine strawberry is cultivated very extensively for\r\n     the supply of the royal tables throughout the whole summer\r\n     and autumn, and one-quarter was devoted to this fruit; the\r\n     plants were set out in long rows, with alternate plantations\r\n     of dahlias, which were now in most profuse bloom; a great\r\n     many of them were the _fancy_ sorts, which are greatly\r\n     admired and extensively cultivated in and around Paris. One\r\n     of the finest we saw was the Beauty of England, purple\r\n     tipped with white; and every flower distinctly marked. The\r\n     strawberries are set out in August or September, and the\r\n     following season produce abundantly; or they may be raised\r\n     from seed in the spring, and planted out to bear a crop in\r\n     the autumn. A moist soil and half shady aspect is most\r\n     favorable, and, in our climate, to expect success, such a\r\n     locality should be selected if possible; an abundance of\r\n     fruit may then be expected. The best berries were as large\r\n     as the finest Woods we generally see in our market. We\r\n     recommend all who love this delicious fruit to try the\r\n     experiment of their cultivation. Such profusion as we saw\r\n     them exposed for sale in the cafés of Paris, shows that\r\n     there can be no great difficulty in the way of success.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORN CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe valleys of the West are regarded as the corn-fields of the world,\r\nand the people seem to regard the crop of corn as the foundation crop.\r\nLately wheat is becoming a rival, particularly in the northern part of\r\nOhio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Our real object, is, not\r\nto theorize,—to teach “book farming”—but to lay before practical men\r\npractical results, to inform them of _what has been done_. We give on\r\npage 382 the method of cultivating the potato as employed by eminent\r\nand successful cultivators. We here present the modes of cultivating\r\ncorn which have produced the largest crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nW. C. YOUNG’S METHOD.—Mr. Young is a Kentucky farmer, and raised 195\r\nbushels of shelled corn to the acre. When this was first published it\r\nquite staggered the faith of eastern farmers. This roused the zeal of\r\nKentucky, and the _Dollar Farmer_ sets forth the manner, and adds a\r\nseries of explanations, all of which we give. We must say, that such a\r\ndepth, for seed on stiff soils—on any soil except the lightest and\r\nmellowest, and on these, in a cool or rainy spring, would not be\r\nproper. Neither could planting be done in March in the latitudes of\r\nIndiana unless in the southern part, and then only in early seasons.\r\nThat Mr. Young did produce 195 bushels to the acre, we feel just as\r\ncertain as that we now hold a pen in our hand. It was measured by as\r\nrespectable gentlemen as any in Jessamine County—gentlemen appointed\r\nfor the purpose by the Jessamine Agricultural Society. And let it be\r\nremembered that this was no first experiment on a single acre. The\r\ncorn was planted and cultivated according to the method long adopted\r\nby Mr. Young, and his whole crop was pronounced equal to the five\r\nacres measured. This extraordinary crop was produced in 1840, a year\r\nvery favorable to corn; but we are told by Mr. Young that in the\r\ndryest years he does not get less than 100 bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\nHere then is not “book farming,” but a method of cultivation\r\n_practised_ for years by a plain, practical, but intelligent farmer.\r\nHere then is actual experience for a course of years, the very thing\r\nthe farmer says he must have before he can be convinced! But, reader,\r\nare you convinced? No. You can not get round the experience, provided\r\nit _was_ experience, and you will take a short way of evading the\r\nmatter by simply saying that you don’t believe a word of the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, these worthy farmers that go so strong for\r\n_facts_ and _experience_, and who yet deny all facts and all\r\nexperience that do not tally with their own notions—these very farmers\r\nare fond of arguing, and like mightily to have the reason or\r\n_rationale_ of things explained; and many a one of them will yield to\r\nthe _theory_ who will not yield to a _fact_. Well, then, let us look\r\ninto the theory of Mr. Y.’s practice. Hear him:\r\n\r\n     “My universal rule is, to plow my corn land the fall\r\n     preceding the spring when I plant; and as early in the\r\n     spring as possible, I cross-plow as deep as circumstances\r\n     will permit; and as soon as this is done, I commence\r\n     checking off—the first way with my large plows, and the\r\n     second with my small ones; the checks three feet by three,\r\n     admitting of working the land both ways. And then I plant my\r\n     corn from the 20th to the 25th of March—a rule to which I\r\n     adhere with scrupulous exactness; planting from eight to\r\n     twelve grains in each hill, covering the same from _four to\r\n     six inches deep_, greatly preferring the latter depth. So\r\n     soon as my corn is up of sufficient height, I start the\r\n     large harrow directly over the rows, allowing a horse to\r\n     walk each side; harrowing the way the corn was planted; and\r\n     on land prepared as above and harrowed as directed, the\r\n     hoeing part will be so completely performed by this process,\r\n     that it will satisfy the most skeptical. Then, allowing the\r\n     corn thus harrowed, to remain a few days, I start my small\r\n     plow with the bar next the corn; and so nicely will this be\r\n     done, that when a row is thus plowed, so completely will the\r\n     intermediate spaces, hills, etc., be lapped in by the loose\r\n     earth, occasioned by this system of close plowing, as to\r\n     render any other work useless for a time. I thin to four\r\n     stalks upon a hill, never having to transplant, the second\r\n     plowing being performed with the moldboard toward the rows\r\n     of corn; and so rapid has been the growth of the corn\r\n     between the first and second plowings, that this is\r\n     performed with ease; and when in this stage, I consider my\r\n     crop safe—my general rule being, never to plow my corn more\r\n     than four times, and harrow once. My practice is, to put a\r\n     field in corn two successive years, then grass it, and let\r\n     it lie eight years—a rule from which I never deviate. Now, I\r\n     do not pretend that the labor bestowed upon a sodfield to\r\n     put it in a state of thorough cultivation, does not meet\r\n     with a fair equivalent from one crop; but I presume no\r\n     farmer will doubt when I say the second year’s crop from sod\r\n     land is better than the first, with not more than one half\r\n     the labor. The best system of farming is to produce the\r\n     greatest amount of profit from the smallest amount of labor.”\r\n\r\nNow what are the essentials of this method?\r\n\r\nFirst—Fertility of soil, kept up by his system of manuring and grass,\r\nof which we shall not speak.\r\n\r\nSecond—Early planting. In consequence of this, the corn matures before\r\nthe dry season commences, and every farmer knows that plenty of rain\r\nwill make a good crop of corn in almost any soil. They all know that\r\nthe essential thing for corn is rain, and there is generally plenty of\r\nrain till about the 1st of July. Mr. Young might plant his corn\r\nconsiderably later and have it come up as early, and grow off more\r\nrapidly, by soaking it in a solution of saltpetre. Thus would the\r\neffect of frost and chilly mornings be in a degree avoided, while we\r\nfeel confident, from our own experience, all injury from the cut-worm\r\nwould be avoided.\r\n\r\nThird—Close planting. Every farmer must know that to produce the\r\nheaviest possible crop, a certain number of stalks must be upon the\r\nground. It is often observed that the great sin of American\r\nagriculture is too thin sowing. Grass is nearly always sowed too thin,\r\nand the same is true of small grain. In England they sow four and five\r\nand sometimes six bushels of oats to the acre; in this country\r\ngenerally not more than a bushel or a bushel and a half. Hence in\r\nEngland they yield three or four times as heavy as in this country;\r\nwhile in this country we never hear of an extraordinary crop where\r\nless than three or four bushels to the acre were sown. Now, we venture\r\nto affirm that no very large corn crop was ever grown unless it was\r\nplanted more than usually thick. In the crop of George W. Williams, of\r\nBourbon county, Kentucky, the corn was planted in rows two feet apart,\r\nwith a stalk every foot in the rows. This crop produced 167 bushels to\r\nthe acre. But there is another important advantage of close planting.\r\nThe corn very soon becomes so dense that the ground is shaded, and the\r\ngrowth of the grass is prevented, and the moisture retained in the\r\nsoil. By this method of cultivation, no grass is ever allowed to\r\nabsorb the moisture from the earth, or to take up the nutritious gases\r\nwhich ought to be appropriated exclusively to the corn.\r\n\r\nFourth—Deep planting. This probably operates favorably by giving the\r\nroots a bedding where the soil is always moist. Another advantage may\r\nbe that the roots are thus not so liable to be broken by the plow in\r\ncultivation. But it must be here noted, that by Mr. Young’s methed,\r\nthe corn is “laid by” before the roots are so extended as to be liable\r\nto much injury from the plow.\r\n\r\nFifth and last—It will be observed that, by Mr. Young’s method, the\r\nsoil is kept very friable and loose, and that to a considerable depth.\r\nThis may be considered the all-essential point in husbandry. One of\r\nthe chief advantages of all manures is, so to divide the soil that the\r\natmosphere, from which plants derive their principal nutriment, may\r\nfreely penetrate to the roots of the plants. In such a loose soil,\r\ntoo, it is well known that much less rain is requisite than in a\r\nstiff, cold, close soil. For this reason, gravel, sand, or sawdust is\r\noften the best manure that can be put upon a stiff soil. In the fall\r\nof the year, Mr. Young turns down very deep a thick-rooted sod of\r\neight years’ standing. The vegetable matter in the sod will obviously\r\nkeep the soil very loose for a year or two by mechanical division, as\r\nwell as by the slow fermentation of this matter in the soil. But this\r\nis not all. The soil is deeply broken up before planting; it is\r\nharrowed thoroughly as soon as the corn comes up, and then there is a\r\nrapid succession of plowing, until the ground is shaded by the corn,\r\nand plowing is no longer possible or necessary. No doubt the plow is\r\npreferable to the hand-hoe or cultivator in the case of Mr. Young; for\r\nit makes the soil loose to a greater depth, and we have already\r\nexplained that, according to his method, the roots of the corn are not\r\nexposed to injury from the plow.\r\n\r\nWe append to this account of Mr. Young’s method, that of several other\r\ncultivators, and are indebted for them to the _Western Farmer and\r\nGuardian_. In Mr. Miller’s account the reader will observe the _depth\r\nof planting_ in a stiff clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SUTTON’S METHOD.—Mr. James M. Sutton, of St. George, Delaware, who\r\nraised upon seventy-nine acres 6,284 bushels of corn, and who gives an\r\naccurate and detailed account of the condition and cultivation of each\r\nfield, makes this remark in relation to the use of the plow:\r\n\r\n     “In order to test the advantage of the cultivator over the\r\n     plow, for tilling corn, he had five rows in this field that\r\n     he lapped the furrow to, with a plow, previous to going over\r\n     it the last time with the cultivator. He soon discovered\r\n     that the growth of these five rows fell short, in height, of\r\n     those adjacent, and yielded one-fifth less corn.\r\n\r\n     “There is no doubt but the true mode of tilling corn,\r\n     especially where sod-ground is used, is to plow deep, and\r\n     use nothing but the fallow and flake-harrow for its\r\n     cultivation. By not disturbing the sod plowed down, it\r\n     remains there as a reservoir of moisture, and an\r\n     exhilarating principle throughout the season, to the growth\r\n     of the corn.”\r\n\r\nUpon Mr. Sutton’s report of his crop, Judge Buel adds the following:\r\n\r\n     “The management which led to the extraordinary product of\r\n     corn, should be deeply impressed upon the mind of every\r\n     corn-grower. 1, The ground was WELL dunged with LONG manure;\r\n     2, it was planted on a grass lay, one deep plowing; 3, it\r\n     was well pulverized with the harrow; 4, the plow was not\r\n     used in the after-culture, nor the corn hilled, but the\r\n     cultivator only used; 5, the sod was not disturbed, nor the\r\n     manure turned to the surface; and 6, the corn was cut at the\r\n     ground when it was fit to top. These are the points which we\r\n     have repeatedly urged in treating of the culture of this\r\n     crop; and their correctness is put beyond question by this\r\n     notable result. The value of lime and marl are well\r\n     illustrated in the second experiment.”\r\n\r\nMr. Charles H. Tomlinson, of Schenectady, N. Y., in giving an account\r\nof his experience says:\r\n\r\n     “The two last years’ corn has been raised in the following\r\n     manner, on the Mohawk Flats near this city. If in grass, the\r\n     land is plowed and well harrowed, lengthwise of the furrow,\r\n     without disturbing the sward. The ground is then prepared\r\n     for planting, by being marked out two and a half feet one\r\n     way and three feet the other. The last season, the field was\r\n     rolled after being planted, with evident benefit, as it made\r\n     it level. When the corn is three inches high, the cultivator\r\n     is passed through both ways; and twice afterward it is used\r\n     in the same manner; no hills are made, but the ground is\r\n     kept level. Neither hand-hoe nor plow are used, after the\r\n     corn is planted. Fields manured with coarse manure have been\r\n     tilled in the same manner. Corn tilled in this way is as\r\n     clean of weeds as when tilled in the usual way: it is no\r\n     more liable to be blown down, and the produce equally good.\r\n     It saves a great deal of hard labor which is an expensive\r\n     item in the usual culture of corn. Last October, ten rods\r\n     were measured out in two different places, in a corn-field,\r\n     on grass land—the one yielding ten, the other nine, bushels\r\n     of ears. In one corn-field, after the last dressing in July,\r\n     timothy and clover-seed were sown, and in the fall the grass\r\n     appeared to have taken as well as it has done in adjoining\r\n     fields where it had been sown with oats.”\r\n\r\nUpon which Judge Buel again remarks: “All, or nearly all, the accounts\r\nwe have published of great products of Indian corn, agree in two\r\nparticulars, viz. in not using the plow in the culture, and in not\r\nearthing, or but very slightly, the hills. These results go to\r\ndemonstrate, that the entire roots are essential to the vigor of the\r\ncrops, and to enable them to perform their functions as nature\r\ndesigned, must be near the surface. If the roots are severed with the\r\nplow, in dressing the crop, the plants are deprived of a portion of\r\ntheir nourishment; and if they are buried deep by hilling, the plant\r\nis partially exhausted in throwing out a new set near the surface,\r\nwhere alone they can perform all their offices. There is another\r\nmaterial advantage in this mode of cultivating the corn crop—it saves\r\na vast deal of manual labor.”\r\n\r\nThe preceding considerations justify us in recommending, that in the\r\nmanagement of the Indian corn crop, the following rules be observed,\r\nor at least partially, so far as to test their correctness.\r\n\r\n1. That the corn harrow and cultivator be substituted for the plow in\r\nthe culture of the crop.\r\n\r\n2. That the plants be not hilled, or but slightly so—this not to\r\nprevent the soil being often stirred and kept clean, and,\r\n\r\n3. That in harvesting, the crop be cut at the ground as soon as the\r\ngrain is glazed.\r\n\r\nAgain, in reference to the system of level cultivation of corn, Judge\r\nBuel remarks:\r\n\r\n     “The experience of the last two years has been sufficient to\r\n     admonish us, that without due precaution, our crops of\r\n     Indian corn will not pay for the labor bestowed on the\r\n     culture; and yet, that where due attention has been paid to\r\n     soil, manure, seed and harvesting, the return has been\r\n     bountiful, notwithstanding bad seasons. Having been\r\n     uniformly successful in the culture of this crop, we feel\r\n     justified in repeating some leading directions for its\r\n     management.”\r\n\r\n“AFTER-CULTURE.—In this the plow should not be used if the corn harrow\r\nand cultivator can be had, and if used, should not be suffered to\r\npenetrate the soil more than two or three inches. The plow tears the\r\nroots, turns up and wastes the manure, and increases the injuries of\r\ndrought. The main object is to extirpate weeds, and to keep the\r\nsurface mellow and open, that the heat, air and moisture may exert\r\nbetter their kind influences upon the vegetable matter in the soil, in\r\nconverting it into nutriment for the crop. At the first dressing with\r\nthe hand-hoe, the plants are reduced to four, or three, in a hill, the\r\nsurface is broken among the plants, the weeds carefully extirpated,\r\nand a little fresh mold gathered to the hill. At the second dressing,\r\na like process is observed, taking care that the earthing shall not\r\nexceed one inch and a half, that the hill be broad and flat, and that\r\nthe earth for this purpose be not taken from one place, but gathered\r\nfrom the surface between the rows, where it has been loosened by the\r\ncultivator.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MILLER’s METHOD.\r\n\r\n                            “GEORGETOWN × ROADS, _Kent Co., Md._\r\n\r\n“I have just finished measuring the corn that grew this year on a lot\r\nof mine of five and a half acres, and have measured 105½ barrels and\r\none bushel of ears, making 103 bushels of corn per acre. The following\r\nis the manner in which I prepared the ground, etc. The soil is a stiff\r\nclay; and one and a half acres of said lot was in clover last year,\r\nthe balance in wheat. I put 265 two-horse cart loads of barn-yard\r\nmanure on it: the manure was coarse, made out of straw, corn-tops and\r\nhusks, hauled into the yard in January and February, and hauled out in\r\nMarch and April, consequently was very little rotted. I spread it\r\nregularly and plowed it down with a large concave plow, seven inches\r\ndeep. I then harrowed it twice the same way it was plowed. I then had\r\nthe rows marked out with a small plow, three feet ten inches wide, and\r\none and a half inches deep. I planted my corn from eighteen to\r\ntwenty-two inches apart, and covered it with hoes: just drawing the\r\nfurrows over the corn, which covered it _one and a half inches below\r\nthe surface_. When the corn was four inches high, I harrowed it, and\r\nthinned it to two stalks in the hill: in about two weeks after\r\nharrowing, I cultivated it: about the 15th of June I cultivated it\r\nagain, which was all the tillage I gave it. We farmers of the eastern\r\nshore count our corn by the thousand: I had 38,640 hills on my lot,\r\nand I think my corn would have been better had I planted earlier: I\r\ndid not plant until the last of April. I think the planting of corn\r\nshallow and working it with the cultivator is much the best way,\r\nespecially on clover lay.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. HOPKINS’ METHOD.—“_Soil and Culture._—The soil is a warm sandy\r\nloam. It was plowed deep in the autumn. About the first of May, I\r\ncarried on, and spread all over the ground, about thirty loads of\r\nstable and barn-yard unfermented manure, then rolled and harrowed the\r\nground well, being careful not to disturb the sod, which was timothy,\r\nand mown the summer preceding; and on the 9th and 10th of May planted\r\nthe same, two and a half feet between the rows, and fifteen inches\r\nbetween the hills. It was dressed with ashes when it made its\r\nappearance above ground. On the 10th June commenced weeding and\r\nthinning, leaving from two to four of the best spears in each hill,\r\nthe whole averaging about three spears in a hill. After this I ashed\r\nit again, using in all about ten bushels of good unleached house\r\nashes. On the 10th of July commenced hoeing, and at the same time took\r\noff all the suckers—put no more about the hills than we took from\r\nthem, but carefully cleaned out all the weeds from the hills. The seed\r\nwas prepared by simply wetting it with warm water, and rolling it in\r\nplaster.\r\n\r\n“HARVESTING.—The corn was cut up on the 18th September at the ground,\r\nand shocked in small shocks; and on the 9th of October it was housed\r\nand husked, and subsequently threshed and measured.\r\n\r\n“PRODUCT.—Ninety-nine bushels of first-rate corn, without even a\r\nnubbin of soft or poor grain, owing to the fact, probably, that there\r\nwere no suckers on which to grow them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe potato crop has never been as much attended to in this region as\r\nin New York, and New England. We believe, however, that its value is\r\nbecoming apparent, and that potatoes will be produced to a much\r\ngreater extent than hitherto. Reserving some remarks of our own to a\r\nfuture number, we insert the methods of cultivation, employed by\r\neminent cultivators.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPURRIER’S METHOD OF CULTIVATION.—“Be careful,” says he, “to procure\r\nsome good sets; that is, to pick a quantity of the best kind of\r\npotatoes perfectly sound and of a tolerably large size; these are to\r\nbe prepared for planting by cutting each root into two, three or more\r\npieces, minding particularly that each piece be furnished with at\r\nleast one or two eyes, which is sufficient. Being thus prepared, they\r\nare to be planted in rows not less than eighteen inches distant: if\r\nthey are to be plowed between, they must not be less than three feet,\r\nand if four feet apart the more eligible.\r\n\r\n“The best method I have found by experience is to make a trench either\r\nwith the spade or plow, about five inches deep, and put long dung or\r\nstraw at the bottom, laying the sets on it at their proper distances,\r\nwhich is from 9 to 12 inches apart, covering them with mold. They must\r\nbe kept clean from weeds.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. KNIGHT’S PLAN.—“He recommends the planting of whole potatoes, and\r\nthose only which are of fine medium size—none to be of less weight\r\nthan four ounces. The early sorts, and, indeed, all which seldom\r\nattain a greater height than two feet, are to be planted about four or\r\nfive inches apart in the rows, centre from centre, the crown ends\r\nupward, the rows to be from 2 feet 6 inches to 3 feet asunder. The\r\nlate potatoes, which produce a haulm above 3 feet in height, are to be\r\nplanted 5 or 6 inches apart, centre from centre, in rows 4 or 5 feet\r\nasunder. The potatoes to point north and south and to be well\r\nmanured.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMACKENZIE’S PLAN.—“Work the ground until it is completely reduced and\r\nfree from root weeds. Three plowings, with frequent harrowings and\r\nrollings, are necessary in both cases, before the land is in a\r\nsuitable condition. When this is accomplished, form the drills; place\r\nthe manure in the drills, plant above it, reverse the drills for\r\ncovering it and the seed, then harrow the drills in length.\r\n\r\n“It is not advantageous to cut the seed into small slips; for the\r\nstrength of the stem at the outset depends in direct proportion to the\r\nvigor and power of the seed-plant. The seed-plant, therefore, ought to\r\nbe large, rarely smaller than the fourth part of the potato; and if\r\nthe seed is of small size, one half of the potato may be profitably\r\nused. At all events, rather err in giving over large seed than in\r\nmaking it too small; because, by the first error, no great loss can\r\never be sustained; whereas, by the other, a feeble and late crop may\r\nbe the consequence. When the seed is properly cut, it requires from\r\nten to twelve hundred weight of potatoes, from 12½ to 15 bushels,\r\nwhere the rows are at 27 inches distance; but this generally depends\r\ngreatly upon the size of the potatoes used; if they are large a\r\ngreater weight may be required; but the extra quality will be\r\nabundantly repaid by the superiority of the crop, which large seed\r\nusually produces. Plant early in May.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNUM’S PLAN.—“Plow deep and pulverize well by thoroughly harrowing;\r\nmanure with compost, decomposed vegetables or barnyard manure; the\r\nlatter preferable. When coarse or raw manure is used it must be spread\r\nand plowed in immediately. Stiff clay soil should always be plowed the\r\nfall previous. Lay your land in drills 27 inches apart, with a small\r\nplow, calculated for turning a deep, narrow furrow running north and\r\nsouth; lay on the bottom of the drills 2 inches of well-rotted\r\nbarnyard manure, or its equivalent, then drop your potatoes, if of the\r\ncommon size, or what is more important, if they retain the usual\r\nquantity of eyes—if more, they should be cut to prevent too many\r\nstalks shooting up together; put a single potato in the drills or\r\ntrenches 10 inches apart, the first should remain uncovered until the\r\nsecond one is deposited, to place them diagonally in the drills, which\r\nwill afford more space between the potatoes one way, than if laid at\r\nright angles in the rows. The covering may be performed with a hoe,\r\nfirst hauling in the furrow raised on each side the drill, then\r\ncarefully take from the centre of the space the soil to finish the\r\ncovering to the depth of 3½ or 4 inches; by taking the earth from the\r\ncentre of the space on either side to the width of 3 inches, it will\r\nleave a drain of 6 inches in the centre of the space and a hill of 14\r\ninches in width gently descending from the drill to the drain, the\r\nwidth and depth of the drill will be sufficient to protect the plant\r\nagainst any injurious effects of a scorching sun or drenching rain.\r\nThe drains in the centre will at all times be found sufficient to pass\r\noff the surplus water.\r\n\r\n“When the plant makes its appearance above the surface, the following\r\nmixture may be used: for each acre take 1 bushel of plaster and 2\r\nbushels of good ashes, and sow it broadcast as even as possible; a\r\nmoist day is preferable for this operation—for want of it, a still\r\nevening will do.\r\n\r\n“The operation of hilling should be performed _once_ and _once only_\r\nduring the season; if repeated after the potatoe is formed it will\r\ncause young shoots to spring up, which retards the growth of the\r\npotatoe and diminishes its size. If weeds spring up at any time they\r\nshould be kept down by the hand or hoe, which can be done without\r\ndisturbing the growth of the stalk.\r\n\r\n“My manner of _hoeing_ or _hilling_ is not to haul in the earth from\r\nthe space between the hills or rows, but to bring on fresh earth\r\nsufficient to raise the hill around the plant 1½ or 2 inches; in a wet\r\nseason the lesser quantity will be sufficient, in a dry one the larger\r\nwill not be found too much. The substance for this purpose may consist\r\nof the scrapings of ditches or filthy streets, or the earth from a\r\nbarnyard that requires levelling: where convenient, it may be taken\r\nfrom swamps, marshes, the beds and banks of rivers or small sluggish\r\nstreams at low water. If planted on a clay soil, fresh loam taken at\r\nany depth from the surface, even if it partakes largely of fine sand,\r\nwill be found an excellent top-dressing. If planted on a loamy soil,\r\nthe earth taken from clay pits, clay or slaty soil will answer a\r\nvaluable purpose; in fact, there are but few farms in the country but\r\nwhat may be furnished with some suitable substance for top-dressing,\r\nif sought for. The hoeing and hilling may be performed with facility\r\nby the aid of a horse and cart, the horse travelling in the centre of\r\na space between the drills, the cart-wheels occupying the two\r\nadjoining ones, thereby avoiding any disturbance or injury to the\r\ngrowing plants.”\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum’s method has attracted great attention, from the fact that\r\nhe actually raised from 1,000 to 1,500 bushels of potatoes to the\r\nacre! When this was first published it was received with great\r\nincredulity; calls were made for the method of cultivation, which drew\r\nforth an elaborate article from Mr. B., of which the above is but a\r\nmorsel. It afterward was stated, and the most authentic and\r\nunquestionable evidence adduced in proof, that Mr. Barnum raised, upon\r\nexperiment, _at the rate_ of more than 3,000 bushels to the acre. Now,\r\nalthough the labor and the great amount of seed required would prevent\r\nthe cultivation of many acres of land thus, yet it is worth a trial in\r\na small way; and if one acre can be made to produce 1,000 bushels, it\r\nwill be as much as is usually dug from _five_ acres; and it is\r\nquestionable whether the labor and seed for five acres are not more\r\nthan that required by Mr. B.’s method for one.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. A. ROBINSON’S PLAN.—He says: “If I plant low ground, I plow my\r\nground in beds in a different direction for the water to drain off,\r\nthen harrow lengthwise of the furrows and small lands; having a number\r\nof them, side and side, I take a light, sharp horse-harrow, and harrow\r\ncrosswise of the beds, which pulverizes the ground and fits it well\r\nfor planting, leaving a small space between the rows, which answers\r\nfor two purposes, one for a guide for the rows for dropping: this is\r\ndone by dropping in the middle of the tracks of the harrow, which is\r\neasily and correctly performed, by any small boy. It also serves\r\ncompletely to fill up all cracks or holes, the seed lying fair and\r\neasy. I then drop my manure directly over the seed potatoes, and when\r\ncovered up, the seed is safe from inundation, by being some inches\r\nabove the surrounding surface: the seed lies warm under this manure,\r\nthe rains drain into the middle furrows; I plant three feet distance;\r\nit takes the most of the surface that is pulverized to cover the\r\npotatoes, and by the time they are twice well hoed, my hills are as I\r\nwant them to be. They naturally rise high above the surface in the\r\nform of a sugar-loaf: this hill is to turn off heavy rains, and it\r\nnaturally keeps the potatoes from being too moist, and they are often\r\ninjured thereby. I have found that three feet each way is the most\r\nproper distance to insure a good crop; I plant three common sized\r\npotatoes in the hill; it is no use to cut them: if cut small, the\r\nvines come up small and weak, grow fast and fall down.”\r\n\r\nThe following method we take from an able writer in the _Louisville\r\nJournal_, signing himself “Grazier:”\r\n\r\n“The ground selected for potatoes should be dry, where no\r\nsurface-water will rest. It should be rich; if not naturally so, it\r\nmust be made so by a sufficient quantity of good manure. It should be\r\nplowed twice, and at least twelve inches deep. After the first\r\nplowing, it should be harrowed and cross harrowed; and after the\r\nsecond plowing, harrowed again, and if not very friable and free from\r\nclods it should then be rolled. The mold cannot be too fine, as on the\r\ndepth of the plowing, and fineness of the earth, depend the _retention\r\nof that moisture_ so indispensable to the health and maturing of all\r\nbulbous roots in particular. The ground thus prepared, should then be\r\nopened off in _drills_, three feet from the centre of one to the\r\ncentre of the other, and, if practicable, running north and south.\r\nWhen opened, if manure is to be applied, it must then be hauled in\r\ncarts; the horse going down between the drills, the bed of the cart\r\nwill cover two drills, where the manure can be pulled out at\r\nintervals, in quantity sufficient, not only for the two drills\r\ndescribed, but for one on each side in addition; all of which one\r\nhand, following with a fork, can easily distribute and spread in the\r\nfour drills.\r\n\r\n“This done, the ground is ready for the seed. I shall first describe\r\nthe whole of the cultivation and harvesting necessary, and then speak\r\nof the seed and its preparation separately. The seed should be dropped\r\nin the manure, twelve inches apart, and as quickly as a drill is\r\nplanted, the plow should follow and cover it in. The _double\r\nmold-board_ plow, which is the proper implement for the business, will\r\ncover two drills by going once up and once down the field; if the\r\nsingle mold-board plow is used, it will of course cover but one drill\r\nby the same operation. When your ground is thus gone over, your land\r\nwill all be in high drills, and can rest so for about one week, when\r\nyou must take a two-horse harrow, and harrow your drills _across_,\r\nleaving your field as level as before your drills were opened. There\r\nis no danger, as some would suppose, of disturbing your seed.\r\n\r\n“In a few days, when you can see your plants distinctly above ground,\r\nfrom one end of your drills to the other, you must take your one-horse\r\nplow, and go up and down each drill, running the _land side_ of your\r\nplow as close to the plant on each side as you safely can, throwing\r\nthe earth _away_ from it, which operation will leave your field in\r\nraised drills between your plants. In a few days after this you take\r\nyour _double mold-board_ plow, and go down the centre of the blank\r\ndrills, covering all your plants nearly out of sight, observing as you\r\ngo along that the weight of earth is thrown _against_, and not _on_,\r\nthe plants. Then, in some days after, when your plants are well over\r\nthe top of your drills, take your scuffle, an implement not unlike\r\nyour cultivator in this country, and for which the cultivator can be\r\nsubstituted, and go over your whole field between the drills, giving\r\nthe earth a good stirring, and not be afraid of encroaching a little\r\nat each side on the drill. At this stage, a boy should follow the\r\nscuffle, and pull up any weeds that appear on the top or sides of the\r\ndrills. In a few days after this, when your plants are strong and well\r\nup, you go down the centre between the drills, with your _double\r\nmold-board_ plow, the wings well apart, and throw the earth well up to\r\nthe plants. This must sometimes finish the cultivation, if the vines\r\nhave spread and are closed too much, but _generally_ the vines will\r\nallow it, and the crop be much benefited by one more scuffling; but\r\nthis time take _particular care not to disturb the drill at the\r\nbottom_, as the bulbs are now forming and spreading; then gently run\r\nyour _double mold-board plow_ through the whole field again,\r\n_narrowing the wings of it_, which will have the effect of adding the\r\nearth, and compressing it to the _bottom_ of the drill, where the\r\nbulbs are forming, rather than throwing it up to the stalk at top,\r\nwhere there is sufficient already. This finishes the cultivation.\r\n\r\n“To prepare the seed you must select well-shaped, even potatoes, not\r\ntoo small nor too large. Cut them, leaving one good eye at least to\r\nevery set; prepare them from two to three weeks _at least_, before you\r\nplant; and each day, as you cut, roll your sets in pulverized lime,\r\nand spread them on the barn floor to dry: when dry, heap them in a\r\ncorner till taken out to plant. If this plan is pursued, and the\r\nground selected and prepared as directed, you may rest satisfied that\r\nso sure as the laws of nature are invariable, and that like effects\r\nfollow like causes, as sure will a _good_ and _sound_ crop of potatoes\r\nbe produced in this climate with no variation in the result, except\r\nwhat may be occasioned by the vicissitudes of the season.\r\n\r\n“Ten tons of potatoes, two thousand two hundred and forty pounds to\r\nthe ton, is considered a _fair_ crop in Ireland. Twelve tons an\r\n_extra_ one—equal to three hundred and seventy bushels the first, and\r\nfour hundred and forty-four bushels the second, allowing sixty pounds\r\nto the bushel, which I have found to be about the average weight of a\r\nbushel here. I have grown four crops of potatoes in this country, in\r\ntwo different situations and latitudes (six acres the smallest\r\nquantity cultivated any season). Each crop was treated in every\r\nparticular as here described, and in three instances out of the four,\r\nI got a little over four hundred measured bushels to the acre. The\r\nfourth crop was only about three hundred and fifty bushels to the\r\nacre, caused by the peculiarity of the season, which produced an\r\nalmost entire failure with my neighbors, under their management.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTING GARDEN PLANTS FOR WINTER USE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoses, geraniums, chrysanthemums, Cape jasmins, etc., which have been\r\nput into the garden borders, should be prepared for removal to the\r\nparlor for winter, before frost, else the plants will not be\r\nestablished in the pots when removed to the parlor, and will thrive\r\nbut poorly.\r\n\r\nSelect the pot which is to receive each plant, draw a circle about the\r\nplant of the size of the pot, then thrust a sharp spade down so as to\r\ncut all the roots at the line of the circle described. Let the plant\r\nremain, watering it _thoroughly_; and if it droops, let it be\r\nsheltered from the sun. In a few days new roots will begin to form\r\nwithin the ball of earth described by the circle, and in three or four\r\nweeks that ball may be carefully lifted, placed in the pot for which\r\nit was measured, and it will go on growing as if nothing had happened\r\nto it. If one waits till frost, then digs up the plant without a\r\nprevious preparation of its roots, it will oftentimes not recover from\r\nthe violence during the winter. But by the method suggested above,\r\nroses, etc., will go on growing and blooming through the winter.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThere are many who suppose it necessary to leave the second growth of\r\ngrass undisturbed, to rot on the ground, in order to preserve the\r\nfertility of old meadows in grass where top dressing with manure is\r\nnot resorted to. But such management is oftentimes extremely hurtful,\r\nand the injury is proportioned to the amount left untrodden and unfed.\r\nIf the amount left standing, or laying loose upon the surface, be\r\nconsiderable, it makes a harbor for mice, which will, under cover of\r\nthe old grass, intersect the surface of the land with paths\r\ninnumerable, from which they cut all the grass that comes in their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY HOWITT’s USE OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is another of those beautiful gems which can never be brought to\r\nthe light too often. And when more appropriately than in the middle of\r\nour spring-time, while bursting buds and fragrant blossoms are\r\ndelighting every sense?\r\n\r\n  God might have made the earth bring forth\r\n    Enough for great and small,\r\n  The oak-tree and the cedar-tree,\r\n    Without a flower at all.\r\n\r\n  We might have had enough, enough\r\n    For every want of ours,\r\n  For luxury, medicine, and toil,\r\n    And yet have had no flowers.\r\n\r\n  The ore within the mountain mine\r\n    Requireth none to grow,\r\n  Nor does it need the lotus flower\r\n    To make the river flow.\r\n\r\n  The clouds might give abundant rain,\r\n    The nightly dews might fall,\r\n  And the herb that keepeth life in man,\r\n    Might yet have drunk them all.\r\n\r\n  Then wherefore, wherefore were they made\r\n    And dyed with rainbow light,\r\n  All fashioned with supremest grace,\r\n    Upspringing day and night?\r\n\r\n  Springing in valleys green and low,\r\n    And on the mountains high,\r\n  And in the silent wilderness,\r\n    Where no man passeth by?\r\n\r\n  Our outward life requires them not,\r\n    Then wherefore had they birth?\r\n  To minister delight to man—\r\n    To beautify the earth.\r\n\r\n  To comfort man, to whisper hope\r\n    Whene’er his faith is dim,\r\n  For whoso careth for the flowers,\r\n    Will much more care for Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE FLOWERS GOOD FOR?\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I have said and written a great deal to my countrymen about\r\n     the cultivation of flowers, ornamental gardening, and rural\r\n     embellishments; and I would read them a homily on the\r\n     subject every day of every remaining year of my life, if I\r\n     thought it would induce them to make this a matter of\r\n     particular attention and care. When a man asks me, what is\r\n     the use of shrubs and flowers, my first impulse is always,\r\n     _to look under his hat and see the length of his ears_. I am\r\n     heartily sick of measuring everything by a standard of mere\r\n     utility and profit; and as heartily do I pity the man, who\r\n     can see no good in life but in the pecuniary gain, or in the\r\n     mere animal indulgences of eating and drinking.”—_Colman’s\r\n     Agricultural Tour._\r\n\r\nWe protest against the sauciness of the italicized line. Mr. Colman\r\nnever feels any such impulse; and if he does, he ought to suspect his\r\nown ears. Nothing is more preposterous than interflagellations among\r\nmen on the matter of likes and dislikes. Every man selects _his_\r\nruling passion, and scoffs at such as do not grow enthusiastic with\r\nhim. A market gardener rails at a florist for fol-de-rol trifles; and\r\nthe florist looks at the length of the fellow’s ears who has nothing\r\nbut turnips, onions, and cabages; while a big Miami farmer, who puts\r\nin his five-hundred-acre corn-patch, by way of summer amusement,\r\nregards both as small affairs. We find no fault with those who possess\r\na super-ardent enthusiasm for flowers; but when they throw it in other\r\npeople’s faces, and call them brutes and asses, for not liking pretty\r\nflowers, we think the thing has been carried quite far enough. We love\r\ngood manners _along_ with pretty flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLIGHT IN THE PEAR-TREE.[18]\r\n\r\nITS CAUSE AND A REMEDY FOR IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1844 will long be remembered for the extensive ravages of\r\nthat disease hitherto denominated _fire-blight_. Beginning at the\r\nAtlantic coast, we have heard of it in Pennsylvania, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and as far as Tennessee; and it is\r\nprobable that it has been felt in every fruit-growing State in the\r\nUnion where the season of 1843 was the same as that west of the\r\nAlleghany range, namely, cold in spring, dry throughout the summer,\r\nand a wet and warm fall, with early and sudden winter.\r\n\r\nIn Indiana, and Ohio the _blight_ has prevailed to such an extent\r\nas to spread dismay among cultivators; destroying entire\r\ncollections—taking half the trees in large orchards—affecting both\r\nyoung and old trees, whether grafted or seedings in soils of every\r\nkind. Many have seen the labor and fond hope of years cut off, in one\r\nseason, by an invisible destroyer, against which none could guard;\r\nbecause, in the conflicting opinions, none were certain whether the\r\ndisease was atmospheric, insect or chemical.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to describe that blight known in the western\r\nStates (without pretending to identify it with the blight known in New\r\nYork and New England), to examine the theories proposed for its\r\ncausation, and to present what now seems to me the true cause.\r\n\r\nI. DESCRIPTION.—Although the signs of it, as will appear in the\r\nsequel, may be detected long before the leaves put out in the spring,\r\nyet its full effects do not begin to appear until May, or if the\r\nspring be backward, until June. On the wood of the last year will be\r\nfound a point where the bark is either dead and dry, or else at the\r\nsame point the bark will be puffed, softened, or sappy with thickened\r\nsap—these two appearances indicating only different degrees of the\r\nsame blight. Wherever the bark is dead and dry, the limb will flourish\r\nabove it, make new wood, ripen its fruit, but perish the ensuing\r\nwinter. In the other case, as soon as the circulation of the sap\r\nbecomes active, the point described shows signs of disease, the leaf\r\nturns to a darker brown than is natural to its ordinary decay, being\r\nnearly black, and the wood perishes.\r\n\r\nThe disease, at first, blights the terminal portions of the branch;\r\nbut the affection spreads gradually downward, and sometimes affects\r\nthe whole trunk. The time from the first appearance of the blight to\r\nthat in which any affected part dies, is various; sometimes two or\r\nthree weeks—sometimes a day only; and sometimes, but rarely, even a\r\nfew hours consummate the disease.\r\n\r\nOn dissecting the branch, the wood is of a dirty, brownish, yellow\r\ncolor; the sap thick and unctuous, of a sour disagreeable odor, like\r\nthat of a fermented watermelon, on the tops of potato vines after they\r\nhave been frosted. In still, moist days, where the blight is extensive\r\nin an orchard, this odor fills the air, and is disagreeably\r\nperceptible at some distance from the trees.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bark bursts, the sap exudes, and runs down, turning\r\nblack; and its acridity will destroy vegetation on which it may drop,\r\nand shoots, at a distance from the trunk, upon which the rain washes\r\nthis ichor, will soon perish. When we come to treat of the _cause_ of\r\nthis disease, it will be important to remember this malignancy of the\r\nfluids.\r\n\r\nWe are carefully to distinguish these appearances, peculiar to what I\r\nsuppose ought to be called _winter-blight_, from another and a\r\n_summer-blight_. In this last, the leaf is affected at first in spots;\r\ngradually the whole leaf turns russet color and drops. Along the wood\r\nmay be seen the hardened trail as of a slimy insect, of an ash color.\r\nThe _wood_ suffers very little by this summer-blight, and sometimes\r\nnone. The winter-blight is found on almost all kinds of trees. This\r\nsummer it has affected the apple, the pear, the peach, the quince, the\r\nEnglish hawthorn, privet, black birch, Spanish chestnut, elder, and\r\ncalycanthus. I enumerate the most of these kinds on the authority of\r\nJ. H. James, of Urbana, Ohio, and C. W. Elliott, of Cincinnati, having\r\nobserved it myself only on fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nII. THEORIES.—A variety of theories exist as to the causes of this\r\ndisease. Some are mere imaginations; some are only ingenious; and some\r\nso near to what I suppose to be the truth, that it is hardly possible\r\nto imagine how the discovery was not made.\r\n\r\nThe injury is done in the fall, but is not seen till spring or summer,\r\nor even the next fall. Thus, six months or a year intervene between\r\nthe _cause_ and the _effect_—a sufficient reason for the difficulty of\r\ndetecting the origin of the evil.\r\n\r\n1. Some have alleged that the rays of the sun, passing through vapors\r\nwhich arise about the trees, concentrate upon the branches, and\r\ndestroy them by the literal energy of fire. Were this true, the young\r\nand tender shoots would suffer first and most; all pear-trees would\r\nsuffer alike; moist and hot summers would be affected with blight;\r\nherbaceous plants would suffer more than ligneous: all of which\r\nresults are contrary to facts.\r\n\r\n2. Some have supposed the soil to contain deleterious substances, or\r\nto be wanting in properties necessary to health. But in either case\r\nsuch a cause of the blight appears untrue, when we consider that trees\r\nsuffer in all soils, rich or poor; that, in the same soil, one tree is\r\nblighted and the next tree escapes; that they will flourish for twenty\r\nyears and then blight; that a tree partially diseased recovers, and\r\nthrives for ten or more years without recurrence of blight.\r\n\r\n3. It has been attributed to violent and sudden changes of temperature\r\nin the air and of moisture in the earth; to sudden change from sward\r\nto high tillage; and the result is stated to be an “overplus” of sap,\r\nor a “surfeit.” All these causes occur every year; but the blight does\r\nnot every year follow them. Changes of temperature, and violent\r\nchanges in the condition of the soil, may be _allied_ with the true\r\ncause. But when _only_ these things exist, no blight follows.\r\n\r\n4. Others have attributed the disease to over-stimulation by high\r\nmanuring, or constant tillage; and it has been said that covering the\r\nroots with stones and rubbish, or laying the orchard down to grass,\r\nwould prevent the evil. Facts warrant no such conclusions. Pear-trees\r\nin Gibson County, Indiana, on a clay soil, with blue slaty subsoil,\r\nwere affected this year more severely than any of which we have heard.\r\nPears in southern parts of this State, on red clay, where the ground\r\nhad long been neglected, suffered as much as along the rich bottom\r\nlands of the Wabash about Vincennes. If there was any difference it\r\nwas in favor of the richest land. About Mooresville, Morgan County,\r\nIndiana, pears have been generally affected, and those in grass lands\r\n_as much_ as those in open soils. Aside from these facts, it is well\r\nknown that pear-trees do not blight in those seasons when they make\r\nthe rankest growth more than in others. They will thrive rampantly for\r\nyears, no evil arising from their luxuriance, and then suddenly die of\r\nblight.\r\n\r\n5. It has been supposed by a few to be the effect of _age_, the\r\ndisease beginning on old varieties, and propagated upon new varieties\r\nby contagion. Were this the true cause, we should expect it to be most\r\nfrequently developed in those pear regions where old varieties most\r\nabound. But this disease seems to be so little known in England, that\r\nLoudon, in his elaborate _Encyclopedia of Gardening_, does not even\r\nmention it. Mr. Manning’s statement will be given further on, to the\r\nsame purport.\r\n\r\n6. Insect theory: The confidence with which eastern cultivators\r\npronounce the cause to be an _insect_, has in part served to cover up\r\nsingular discrepancies in the separate statements in respect to the\r\nravages, and even the species of this destroyer. The _Genesee Farmer_\r\nof July, 1843, says, “the cause of the disease was for many years a\r\nmatter of dispute, and is so still by some persons; but the majority\r\nare now fully convinced that it is the work of an insect (_scolytus\r\npyri_).” T. W. Harris, in his work on insects, speaks of the minuteness\r\nand obscure habits of this insect, as “reasons why it has eluded the\r\nresearches of those persons who disbelieve in its existence as the\r\ncause of the blasting of the limbs of the _pear-tree_.” Dr. Harris\r\nevidently supposed, until so late as 1843, that this insect infested\r\nonly the _pear-tree_; for he says, “the discovery of the blight-beetle\r\nin the limbs of the apple-tree, is a new fact in natural history; but\r\nit is easily accounted for, because this tree belongs not only to the\r\nsame natural group, but also to the same genus as the pear-tree. It is\r\nnot, therefore, surprising, that both the pear and the apple-tree\r\nshould occasionally be attacked by the same insect.” [See an article\r\nin the _Massachusetts Ploughman_, summer of 1843, quoted in _Genesee\r\nFarmer_, July, 1843.]\r\n\r\nThis insect is said to eat through the _alburnum_, the hard wood, and\r\neven a part of the pith, and to destroy the branch by separation of\r\npart from part, as a saw would. On these facts, which there is no room\r\nto question, we make two remarks.\r\n\r\n1st. That the blight thus produced is _limited_, and probably\r\nsectional or local. No account has met my eye which leads me to\r\nsuppose that any considerable injury has been done by it. Mr. Manning,\r\nof Salem, Mass., in the second edition of his “Book of Flowers,”\r\nstates that he has never “_had any trees affected by it_”—the blight.\r\nYet his garden and nursery has existed for twenty years, and contained\r\nimmense numbers of trees.\r\n\r\n2d. It is very plain that neither Mr. Lowell, originally, nor Dr.\r\nHarris, nor any who describe the blight as caused by the\r\nblight-beetle, had any notion of that disease which passes by the same\r\nname in the middle and western States. The blight of the _scolytus\r\npyri_ is a mere _girdling_ of the branches—a mechanical separation of\r\nparts; and no mention is made of the most striking facts incident to\r\nthe great blight—the viscid unctuous sap; the bursting of the bark,\r\nthrough which it issues; and its poisonous effects on the young shoots\r\nupon which it drops.\r\n\r\nWe do not doubt the insect-blight; but we are sure that it is not\r\n_our_ blight. We feel very confident, also, that this blight, which\r\nfrom its devastations may be called the great blight, has been felt in\r\nNew England, in connection with the insect-blight, and confounded with\r\nit, and the effects of two different causes happening to appear in\r\nconjunction, have been attributed to one, and the least influential\r\ncause. The writer in Fessenden’s _American Gardener_ (Mr. Lowell?)\r\nsays of the blight, “it is sometimes so rapid in its progress, that in\r\na few hours from its first appearance the whole tree will appear to be\r\nmortally diseased.” This is not insect-blight; for did the\r\nblight-beetle eat so _suddenly_ around the whole _trunk_? Now here is\r\na striking appearance of the great blight, confounded with the minor\r\nblight, as we think will appear in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThis theory has stood in the way of a discovery of the true cause of\r\nthe great blight; for every cultivator has gone in search of insects;\r\nthey have been found in great plenty, and in great variety of species,\r\nand their harmless presence accused with all the mischief of the\r\nseason. A writer in the _Farmer’s Advocate_, Jamestown, N. C.,\r\ndiscerned the fire-blight, and traced it to “small, _red_, pellucid\r\ninsects, briskly moving from place to place on the branches.” This is\r\nnot the _scolytus pyri_ of Prof. Peck and Dr. Harris.\r\n\r\nDr. Mosher, of Cincinnati, in a letter published in the _Farmer and\r\nGardener_ for June, 1844, describes a third insect—“_very minute\r\nbrown-colored aphides_, snugly secreted in the axilla of every leaf on\r\nseveral small branches; … most of them were busily engaged with their\r\nproboscis inserted through the tender cuticle of this part of the\r\n_petiole_ of the leaf, feasting upon the _vital juices_ of the tree.\r\nThe leaves being thus deprived of the necessary sap for nourishment\r\nand elaboration soon perished, … while all that part of the branch and\r\ntrunk below, dependent upon the elaborated sap of the deadened leaves\r\nabove, shrunk, turned black, and dried up,” p. 261.\r\n\r\nLindley, in his work on _Horticulture_, p. 42-46, has detailed\r\nexperiments illustrating vegetable _perspiration_, from which we may\r\nform an idea of the amount of fluid which these “very-minute\r\nbrown-colored aphides” would have to drink. A sunflower, three and a\r\nhalf feet high, perspired in a very warm day thirty ounces—nearly two\r\npounds; on another day, twenty ounces. Taking the old rule, “a pint a\r\npound,” nearly a quart of fluid was exhaled by a sunflower in twelve\r\nhours; and the vessels were still inflated with a fresh supply drawn\r\nfrom the roots. Admitting that the leaves of a fruit-tree have a less\r\ncurrent of sap than a sunflower or a grape-vine, yet in the months of\r\nMay and June, the amount of sap to be exhausted by these very minute\r\nbrown aphides, would be so great, that if they drank it so suddenly as\r\nto cause a tree to die in a day, they would surely augment in bulk\r\nenough to be discovered without a lens. If some one had accounted for\r\nthe low water in the Mississippi, in the summer of 1843, by saying\r\nthat buffaloes had drank up all the upper Missouri, and cut off the\r\nsupply, we should be at a loss which most to pity, the faith of the\r\nnarrator, or the probable condition of the buffaloes after their feat\r\nof imbibition.\r\n\r\nBut the most curious results _follow_ these feats of suction. The\r\nlimbs and trunk _below_ shrink and turn black, for want of that\r\nelaborated sap extracted by the aphides. And yet every year we perform\r\nartificially this very operation in _ringing_ or _decortication_ of\r\nbranches, for the purpose of accelerating maturation or improving the\r\nfruit. Every year the _saw_ takes off a third, a half, and sometimes\r\nmore, of a living tree; and the effect is to produce new shoots, not\r\ndeath. Is an operation which can be safely performed by man, _deadly_\r\nwhen performed by an insect? Dr. Masher did not detect the insects\r\nwithout extreme search, and then only in colonies, on healthy\r\nbranches. Do whole trees wither in a day by the mere suction of such\r\ninsects? Had they been supposed to _poison_ the fluids, the theory\r\nwould be less exceptionable, since poisons in minute quantities may be\r\nvery malignant.\r\n\r\nWhile we admit a limited mischief of insects, they can never be the\r\ncause of the prevalent blight of the middle and western States—such a\r\nblight as prevailed in and around Cincinnati in the summer of 1844—nor\r\nof that blight which prevailed in 1832. The _blight-beetle_, after\r\nmost careful search and dissection, has not been found, nor any trace\r\nor passage of it. Dr. Mosher’s insect may be set aside without further\r\nremark.\r\n\r\nI think that further observation will confirm the following\r\nconclusions:\r\n\r\n1. Insects are frequently found feeding in various ways upon blighted\r\ntrees, or on trees which afterward become so.\r\n\r\n2. Trees are fatally blighted on which no insects are discerned\r\nfeeding—neither aphides nor _scolytus pyri_.\r\n\r\n3. Multitudes of trees have such insects on them as are in other cases\r\nsupposed to cause the blight, without a sign of blight following. This\r\nhas been the case in our own garden.\r\n\r\nIII. CAUSE OF THE BLIGHT.—The Indiana Horticultural Society, early in\r\nthe summer of 1844, appointed a committee to collect and investigate\r\nfacts on the Fire-Blight. While serving on this committee, and\r\ninquiring in all the pear-growing regions, we learned that Reuben\r\nReagan, of Putnam County, Ind., was in possession of much information,\r\nand supposed himself to have discovered the cause of this evil; and to\r\nhim we are indebted for a first suggestion of the cause. Mr. Reagan\r\nhas for more than twelve years past suspected that this disease\r\noriginated in the fall previous to the summer on which it declares\r\nitself. During the last winter Mr. Reagan predicted the blight, and in\r\nhis pear-orchards he marked the trees that would suffer, and pointed\r\nto the spot which would be the seat of the disease; and his\r\nprognostications were strictly verified. After gathering from him all\r\nthe information which a limited time would allow, we obtained from\r\nAaron Alldredge, of Indianapolis, a nurseryman of great skill, and\r\npossessed of careful, cautious habits of observation, much\r\ncorroborative information; and particularly a tabular account of the\r\nblight for nine years past in his nursery and orchard.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1843 opened early, but cold and wet, until the last of\r\nMay. The summer was both dry and cool, and trees made very little\r\ngrowth of new wood. Toward autumn, however, the drought ceased,\r\ncopious rains saturated the ground, and warm weather started all trees\r\ninto vigorous, though late, growth. At this time, while we hoped for a\r\nlong fall and a late winter, on the contrary we were surprised by an\r\nearly and sudden winter, and with unusual severity at the very\r\nbeginning. In the West, much corn was ruined and more damaged; and\r\nhundreds of bushels of apples were caught on the trees and spoiled—one\r\ncultivator alone losing five hundred bushels. Caught in this early\r\nwinter, what was the condition of fruit-trees? They were making rapid\r\ngrowth, every part in a state of excitement, the wood unripe, the\r\npassages of ascent and descent impleted with sap. In this condition,\r\nthe fluids were suddenly frozen—the growth instantly checked; and the\r\nwhole tree, from a state of great excitability, was, by one shock,\r\nrudely forced into a state of rest. Warm suns, for a time, followed\r\nsevere nights. What would be the effect of this freezing and sudden\r\nthawing upon the fluids and their vessels? We have been able to find\r\nso little written upon vegetable morbid anatomy (probably from the\r\nwant of access to books), that we can give but an imperfect account of\r\nthe derangement produced upon the circulating fluids by congelation.\r\nWe cannot state the specific changes produced by cold upon the\r\nascending sap, or on the cambium, nor upon the elaborated descending\r\ncurrent. There is reason to suppose that the two latter only suffer,\r\nand probably only the last. That freezing and thawing decompose the\r\ncoloring matter of plants is known; but what other decomposition, if\r\nany, is effected, we know not. The effect of congelation upon the\r\ndescending sap of pear and apple-trees, is to turn it to a viscid,\r\nunctuous state. It assumes a reddish brown color; becomes black by\r\nexposure to the air; is poisonous to vegetables even when applied upon\r\nthe leaf. Whether in some measure this follows all degrees of\r\ncongelation, or only under certain conditions, we have no means of\r\nknowing.\r\n\r\nThe effect of freezing and thawing upon the tissues and sap-vessels is\r\nbetter known. Congelation is accompanied with expansion; the tender\r\nvessels are either burst or lacerated; the excitability of the parts\r\nis impaired or destroyed; the air is expelled from the aëriferous\r\ncavities, and forced into the passages for fluids; and lastly, the\r\ntubes for the conveyance of fluids are obstructing by a thickening of\r\ntheir sides.[19] The fruit-trees, in the fall of 1843, were then\r\nbrought into a morbid state—the sap thickened and diseased; the\r\npassages lacerated, obstructed, and probably, in many instances burst.\r\nThe sap elaborated, and now passing down in an injured state, would\r\ndescend slowly, by reason of its inspissation, the torpidity of the\r\nparts, and the injured condition of the vessels. The grosser parts,\r\nnaturally the most sluggish, would tend to lodge and gradually collect\r\nat the junction of fruit-spurs, the forks of branches, or wherever the\r\ncondition of the sap-vessels favored a lodgment. In some cases the\r\npassages are wholly obstructed; in others, only in part.\r\n\r\nAt length the spring approaches. In early pruning, the cultivator will\r\nfind, in those trees which will ere long develop blight, that the\r\nknife is followed by an unctuous sap, and that the liber is of a\r\ngreenish yellow color. These will be the first signs, and the\r\npractised eye may detect them long before a leaf is put forth.\r\n\r\nWhen the season is advanced sufficiently to excite the tree to action,\r\nthe sap will, as usual, ascend by the alburnum, which has probably\r\nbeen but little injured; the leaf puts out, and no outward sign of\r\ndisease appears; nor will it appear until the leaf prepares the\r\ndownward current. May, June and July, are the months when the growth\r\nis most rapid, and when the tree requires the most elaborate sap; and\r\nin these months the blight is fully developed. When the descending\r\nfluid reaches the point where, in the previous fall, a total\r\nobstruction had taken place, it is as effectually stopped as if the\r\nbranch were girdled. For the sap which had lodged there would, by the\r\nwinds and sun, be entirely dried. This would not be the case if the\r\nsap was good and the vitality of the wood unimpaired; but where the\r\nsap and vessels are both diseased, the sun affects the branch on the\r\ntree just as it would if severed and lying on the ground. There will,\r\ntherefore, be found on the tree, branches with spots where the bark is\r\ndead and shrunk away below the level of the surrounding bark; and at\r\nthese points the current downward is wholly stopped. Only the\r\n_outward_ part, however, is dead, while the _alburnum_, or sap-wood,\r\nis but partially injured. Through the alburnum, then, the sap from the\r\nroots passes up, enters the leaf, and men are astonished to see a\r\nbranch, seemingly dead in the middle, growing thriftily at its\r\nextremity. No insect-theory can account for this case; yet it is\r\nperfectly plain and simple when we consider that there are two\r\ncurrents of sap, one of which may be destroyed, and the other for a\r\n_limited time_ go on. The blight, under this aspect, is nothing but\r\n_ringing_ or _decortication_, effected by diseased sap, destroying the\r\nparts in which it lodges, and then itself drying up. The branch will\r\ngrow, fruit will set, and frequently become larger and finer flavored\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\nBut in a second class of cases, the downward current comes to a point\r\nwhere the diseased sap had effected only a partial lodgment. The\r\nvitality of the neighboring parts was preserved, and the diseased\r\nfluids have been undried by wind or sun, and remain more or less\r\ninspissated. The descending current meets and takes up more or less of\r\nthis diseased matter, according to the particular condition of the\r\nsap. Wherever the elaborated sap passes, after touching this diseased\r\nregion, it will carry its poison along with it down the trunk, and, by\r\nthe lateral vessels, in toward the pith. We may suppose that a\r\nviolence which would destroy the health of the outer parts, would, to\r\nsome degree, rupture the inner sap-vessels. By this, or by some\r\nunknown way, the diseased sap is taken into the inner,[20] upward\r\ncurrent, and goes into the general circulation. If it be in a diluted\r\nstate, or in small quantities, languor and decline will be the result;\r\nif in large quantities, and concentrated, the branch will die\r\nsuddenly, and the odor of it will be that of frost-bitten vegetation.\r\nAll the different degrees of mortality result from the quantity and\r\nquality of the diseased sap which is taken into circulation. In\r\nconclusion, then, where, in one class of cases, the feculent matter\r\nwas, in the fall, so virulent as to destroy the parts where it lodged,\r\nand was then dried by exposure to wind and sun, the branch above will\r\nlive, even through the summer, but perish the next winter; and the\r\nspring afterward, standing bare amid green branches, the cultivator\r\nmay suppose the branch to have blighted that spring, although the\r\ncause of death was seated eighteen months before. When, in the other\r\nclass of cases, the diseased sap is less virulent in the fall, but\r\nprobably growing worse through the spring, a worse blight ensues, and\r\na more sudden mortality.\r\n\r\nWe will mention some proofs of the truth of this explanation.\r\n\r\n1. The two great blight years throughout the region of Indianapolis,\r\n1832 and 1844, were preceded by a summer and fall such as we have\r\ndescribed. In the autumns of both 1831 and 1843, the orchards were\r\novertaken by a sudden freeze while in a fresh-growing state; and in\r\nboth cases the consequence was excessive destruction the ensuing\r\nspring and summer.\r\n\r\n2. In consequence of this diagnosis, it has been found practicable to\r\npredict the blight six months before its development. The statement of\r\nthis fact, on paper, may seem a small measure of proof; but it would\r\nweigh much with any candid man to be told, by an experienced\r\nnurseryman, this is such a fall as will make blight; to be taken,\r\nduring the winter into the orchard, and told, this tree has been\r\nstruck at the junction of these branches; that tree is not at all\r\naffected; this tree will die entirely the next season; this tree will\r\ngo first on this side, etc., and to find, afterward, the prediction\r\nverified.\r\n\r\n3. This leads us to state separately, the fact, that, after such a\r\nfall, blighted-trees may be ascertained during the process of late\r\nwinter or early spring pruning.\r\n\r\nIn priming before the sap begins to rise freely, no sap should follow\r\nthe knife in a healthy tree. But in trees which have been affected\r\nwith blight, a sticky, viscid sap exudes from the wound.\r\n\r\n4. Trees which ripen their wood and leaves early, are seldom affected.\r\nThis ought to elicit careful observation; for, if found true, it will\r\nbe an important element in determining the value of varieties of the\r\npear in the middle and western States, where the late and warm autumns\r\nrender orchards more liable to winter blight than New England\r\norchards. An Orange Bergamot, grafted upon an apple stock, had about\r\nrun out; it made a small and feeble growth, and cast its leaves in the\r\nsummer of 1843, long before frost. It escaped the blight entirely;\r\nwhile young trees, and of the same kind (we believe), standing about\r\nit, and growing vigorously till the freeze, perished the next season.\r\nI have before me a list of more than fifty varieties, growing in the\r\norchard of Aaron Alldredge, of Indianapolis, and their history since\r\n1836; and so far as it can be ascertained, late-growing varieties are\r\nthe ones, in every case, subject to blight; and of those which have\r\nalways escaped, the most part are known to ripen leaf and wood early.\r\n\r\n5. Wherever artificial causes have either _produced_ or _prevented_ a\r\ngrowth so late as to be overtaken by a freeze, blight has,\r\nrespectively, been _felt_ or _avoided_. Out of 200 pear-trees, only\r\nfour escaped in 1832, in the orchard of Mr. Reagan. These four had,\r\nthe previous spring, been _transplanted_, and had made little or no\r\ngrowth during summer or fall. If, however, they had recovered\r\nthemselves, during the summer, so as to grow in the autumn,\r\ntransplanting would have had just the other effect; as was the case in\r\na row of pear-trees, transplanted by Mr. Alldredge in 1843. They stood\r\nstill through the summer and made growth in the fall—were frozen—and\r\nin 1844 manifested severe blight. Mr. Alldredge’s orchard affords\r\nanother instructive fact. Having a row of the St. Michael pear (of\r\nwhich any cultivator might have been proud), standing close by his\r\nstable, he was accustomed, in the summer of 1843, to throw out, now\r\nand then, manure about them, to force their growth. Under this\r\nstimulus they were making excessive growth when winter-struck. Of all\r\nhis orchard, they suffered, the ensuing summer, the most severely. Of\r\ntwenty-two trees _twelve_ were affected by the blight, and _eight_\r\nentirely killed. Of seventeen trees of the Bell pear, eleven suffered,\r\nbut none were killed. All in this region know the vigorous habit of\r\nthis tree. Of eight Crassane Bergamot (a late grower), five were\r\naffected and two killed. In an orchard of 325 trees of 79 varieties,\r\none in seven blighted, 25 were totally destroyed. Although a minute\r\nobservation was not made on each tree, yet, as a general fact, those\r\nwhich suffered were trees of a full habit and of a late growth.\r\n\r\n6. Mr. White, a nurseryman near Mooresville, Morgan County, Indiana,\r\nin an orchard of from 150 to 200 trees, had not a single case of the\r\nblight in the year 1844, though all around him its ravages were felt.\r\nWhat were the facts in this case? His orchard is planted on a\r\nmound-like piece of ground; is high, of a sandy, gravelly soil:\r\nearlier by a week than nursery soils in this county; and in the summer\r\nof 1843 his trees grew through the summer; wound up and shed their\r\nleaves early in the fall, and during the warm spell made no _second\r\ngrowth_. The orchard, then, that escaped, was one on such a soil as\r\ninsured an _early_ growth, so that the winter fell upon ripened wood.\r\n\r\n7. It may be objected, that if the blight _began_ in the new and\r\ngrowing wood, it would appear there; whereas the seat of the evil, _i.\r\ne._ the place where the bark is diseased or dead, is lower down and on\r\nold wood. Certainly, it should be; for the returning sap falls some\r\nways down before it effects a lodgment.\r\n\r\n8. It might be said that _spring-frosts_ might produce this disease.\r\nBut in the spring of 1834, in the last of May, after the forest-trees\r\nwere in full leaf; there came frost so severe as to cut every leaf;\r\nand to this day the dead tops of the beech attest the power of the\r\nfrost. But no _blight_ occurred that year in orchard, garden or\r\nnursery.\r\n\r\n9. It may be asked why forest-trees do not suffer. To some extent they\r\ndo. But usually the dense shade preserves the moisture of the soil,\r\nand favors an equal growth during the spring and summer; so that the\r\nexcitability of the tree is spent before autumn, and it is going to\r\nrest when frost strikes it.\r\n\r\n10. It may be inquired why fall-growing shrubs are not always\r\nblighted, since many kinds are invariably caught by the frost in a\r\ngrowing state.\r\n\r\nWe reply, first, that we are not to say that _every_ tree or shrub\r\nsuffers from cold in the same manner. We assert it of fruit-trees\r\nbecause it has been observed; it must be asserted of other trees only\r\nwhen ascertained.\r\n\r\nWe reply more particularly, that a _mere frost_ is not supposed to do\r\nthe injury. The conditions under which blight is supposed to originate\r\nare, a growing state of the tree, a sudden _freeze_, and sudden\r\nthawing.\r\n\r\nWe would here add, that many things are yet to be ascertained before\r\nthis theory can be considered as settled; as the actual state of the\r\nsap after congelation, ascertained by experiment; the condition of\r\nsap-vessels, as ascertained by dissection; whether the congelation, or\r\nthe thawing, or both, produce the mischief; whether the character of\r\nthe season _following_ the fall-injury may not materially modify the\r\nmalignancy of the disease; seasons that are hot, moist and cloudy,\r\npropagating the evil; and others dry, and cool, restraining growth and\r\nthe dsease. It is to be hoped that these points will be carefully\r\ninvestigated, not by conjecture, but by scientific processes.\r\n\r\n11. We have heard it objected, that trees grafted in the spring blight\r\nin the graft during the summer. If the _stock_ had been affected in\r\nthe fall, blight would arise from _it_; if the scion had, in common\r\nwith the tree from which it was cut, been injured, blight must arise\r\nfrom _it_.\r\n\r\nBlight is frequently caused in the nursery; and the cultivator, who\r\nhas brought trees from a distance, and with much expense, has scarcely\r\nplanted them before they show blight and die.\r\n\r\n12. It is objected, that while only a single branch is at first\r\naffected, the evil is imparted to the whole tree; not only to the wood\r\nof the last year, but to the old branches. We reply, that if a single\r\nbranch only should be affected by fall-frost, and be so severely\r\naffected as to become a repository of much malignant fluid, it might\r\ngradually enter the system of the whole tree, through the circulation.\r\nThis fact shows, why _cutting_ is a partial remedy; every diseased\r\nbranch removed, removes so much poison; it shows also why cutting from\r\n_below_ the seat of the disease (as if to fall below the haunt of a\r\nsupposed insect), is beneficial. The farther the cut is made from that\r\npoint where the sap has clogged the passages, the less of it will\r\nremain to enter the circulation.\r\n\r\n13. Trees of great vigor of constitution, in whose system but little\r\npoison exists, may succeed after a while in rejecting the evil, and\r\nrecover. Where much enters the system, the tree must die; and with a\r\nsuddenness proportioned to the amount of poison circulated.\r\n\r\n14. A rich and _dry_ soil would be likely to promote early growth, and\r\nthe tree would finish its work in time; but a rich and _moist_ soil,\r\nby forcing the growth, would prepare the tree for blight; so that rich\r\nsoils may prevent or prepare for the blight, and the difference will\r\nbe the difference of the respective soils in producing an early\r\ninstead of a late growth.\r\n\r\nIV. REMEDY.—So long as the blight was believed to be of insect origin,\r\nit appeared totally irremediable. If the foregoing reasoning be found\r\ncorrect, it will be plain that the scourge can only be occasional;\r\nthat it may be in a degree prevented; and to some extent remedied\r\nwhere it exists.\r\n\r\n1. We should begin by selecting for pear orchards a warm, light, rich,\r\ndry and early soil. This will secure an early growth and ripe wood\r\nbefore winter sets in.\r\n\r\n2. So soon as observation has determined what kinds are naturally\r\nearly growers and early ripeners of wood, such should be selected; as\r\nthey will be least likely to come under those conditions in which\r\nblight occurs.\r\n\r\n3. Wherever orchards are already planted; or where a choice in soils\r\ncannot be had, the cultivator may know by the last of August or\r\nSeptember, whether a fall-growth is to be expected. To prevent it, we\r\nsuggest immediate _root-pruning_. This will benefit the tree at any\r\nrate, and will probably, by immediately restraining growth, prevent\r\nblight.\r\n\r\n4. Whenever blight has occurred, we know of no remedy but free and\r\nearly _cutting_. In some cases it will remove all diseased matter; in\r\nsome it will alleviate only; but in bad blight, there is neither in\r\nthis, nor in anything else that we are aware of, any remedy.\r\n\r\nThere are two additional subjects, with which we shall close this\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n1. This blight is not to be confounded with _winter-killing_. In the\r\nwinter of either 1837 or 1838, in March a deep snow fell (in the\r\nregion of Indianapolis) and was immediately followed by brilliant sun.\r\nThousands of nursery-trees perished in consequence, but without\r\nputting out leaves, or lingering. It is a familiar fact to\r\norchardists, that severe cold, followed by warm suns, produce a\r\nbursting of the bark along the trunk; but usually at the surface of\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n2. We call the attention of cultivators to the disease of the\r\npeach-tree, called “The Yellows.” We have not spoken of it as the same\r\ndisease as the _blight_ in the pear and the apple, only because we did\r\nnot wish to embarrass this subject by too many issues. We will only\r\nsay, that it is the opinion of the most intelligent cultivators among\r\nus, that the yellows are nothing but the development of the blight\r\naccording to the peculiar habits of the peach-tree. We mention it,\r\nthat observation may be directed to the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [18] Read before the Indiana Horticultural Society, and\r\n     communicated by Mr. Beecher to Hovey’s Magazine of\r\n     Horticulture, December, 1844.\r\n\r\n     [19] Lindley’s Horticulture, p. 81-82.\r\n\r\n     [20] See Lindley, p. 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF HORTICULTURE IN INDIANA.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nI am induced to send you some remarks upon Horticultural matters, from\r\nobserving your disposition to make your magazine not merely a record\r\nof specific processes, and a register of plants and fruits, but also a\r\nchronicle of the yearly progress and condition of the Horticultural\r\nart. I should be glad if I could in any degree thus repay the pleasure\r\nwhich others have given me through your numbers, by reciprocal\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nThe Indiana Horticultural State fair is held annually, on the 4th and\r\n5th of October. Experience has shown that it should be earlier; for,\r\nalthough a better assortment of late fruits, in which, hitherto, we\r\nhave chiefly excelled, is secured, it is at the expense of small\r\nfruits and flowers. The floral exhibition was meagre—the frost having\r\nalready visited and despoiled our gardens. The chief attraction, as,\r\nin an agricultural community, it must long continue to be, was the\r\nexhibition of fruit. My recollection of New England fruits, after an\r\nabsence of more than ten years, is not distinct; but my impression is,\r\nthat so fine a collection of fruits could scarcely be shown there. The\r\nluxuriance of the peach, the plum, the pear and the apple, is such, in\r\nthis region, as to afford the most perfect possible specimens. The\r\nvigor of fruit-trees, in such a soil and under a heaven so congenial,\r\nproduces fruits which are very large without being coarse-fleshed; the\r\nflavor concentrated, and the color very high. It is the constant\r\nremark of emigrants from the East, that our apples surpass those to\r\nwhich they have been accustomed. Many fruits which I remember in\r\nConnecticut as light-colored, appear with us almost refulgent. All\r\nsummer and early fall apples were gone before our exhibition; but\r\nbetween seventy and a hundred varieties of winter apples were\r\nexhibited. We never expect to see finer. Our most popular winter\r\napples are: Yellow Bellflower; White Bellflower (called _Detroit_ by\r\nthe gentlemen of Cincinnati Horticultural Society—but for reasons\r\nwhich are not satisfactory to my mind. What has become of the White\r\nBellflower of _Coxe_, if this is not it?) Newtown Spitzenberg,\r\nexceedingly fine with us; Canfield, Jennetting or Neverfail, escaping\r\nspring frosts by late blossoming, very hardy, a great bearer every\r\nyear; the fruit comes into eating in February, is tender, juicy, mild\r\nand sprightly, and preferred with us to the Green Newtown\r\npippin—keeping full as well, bearing better, the pulp much more\r\n_manageable_ in the mouth, and the apple has the peculiar property of\r\nbearing frosts, and even freezing, without material injury; Green\r\nNewtown pippin; Michael Henry pippin (very fine); Pryor’s Red, in\r\nflavor resembling the New England Seek-no-further; Golden Russet, the\r\nprince of small apples, and resembling a fine butter-pear more nearly\r\nthan any apple in our orchards—an enormous bearer; some limbs\r\nexhibited were clustered with fruit, more like bunches of grapes than\r\napples; Milam, favorite early winter; Rambo, the same. But the apple\r\nmost universally cultivated is the Vandervere pippin, only a second or\r\nthird-rate table apple, but having other qualities which quite ravish\r\nthe hearts of our farmers. The tree is remarkably vigorous and\r\nhealthy; it almost never fails in a crop; when all others _miss_, the\r\nVandervere pippin _hits_; the fruit, which is very large and comely,\r\nis a late winter fruit—yet swells so quickly as to be the first and\r\nbest summer cooking apple. If its flesh (which is coarse) were fine,\r\nand its (too sharp) flavor equalled that of the Golden Russet, it\r\nwould stand without a rival, or near neighbor, at the very head of the\r\nlist of winter apples. As it is, it is a _first-rate_ tree, bearing a\r\n_second-rate_ apple. A hybrid between it and the Golden Russet, or\r\nNewtown Spitzenberg, appropriating the virtues of both, would leave\r\nlittle more to be hoped for or wished. The _Baldwin_ has never come up\r\nto its eastern reputation with us; the Rhode Island Greening is eaten\r\nfor the sake of “auld lang syne;” the Roxbury russet is not yet in\r\nbearing—instead of it several false varieties have been presented at\r\nour exhibitions. All the classic apples of your orchards are planted\r\nhere, but are yet on probation.\r\n\r\nNothing can exhibit better the folly of trusting to _seedling_\r\norchards for fruit, for a main supply, than our experience in this\r\nmatter. The early settlers could not bring trees from Kentucky,\r\nVirginia or Pennsylvania—and, as the next resort, brought and planted\r\nseeds of popular apples. A later population found no nurseries to\r\nsupply the awakening demand for fruit-trees, and resorted also to\r\nplanting seed. That which, at first, sprang from necessity, has been\r\ncontinued from habit, and from an erroneous opinion that seedling\r\nfruit was better than grafted. An immense number of seedling trees are\r\nfound in our State. Since the Indiana Horticultural Society began to\r\ncollect specimens of these, more than one hundred and fifty varieties\r\nhave been sent up for inspection. Our rule is to reject every apple\r\nwhich, the habits of the tree and the quality of its fruit being\r\nconsidered, has a superior or equal already in cultivation. Of all the\r\nnumber presented, not six have vindicated their claims to a name or a\r\nplace—and not more than _three_ will probably be known ten years\r\nhence. While, then, we encourage cultivators to raise seedlings\r\nexperimentally, it is the clearest folly to reject the established\r\nvarieties and trust to inferior seedling orchards. From facts which I\r\nhave collected there has been planted, during the past year, in this\r\nState, at least one hundred thousand apple-trees. Every year the\r\ndemand increases. It is supposed that the next year will surpass this\r\nby at least twenty-five thousand.\r\n\r\nIn connection with apple orchards, our farmers are increasingly\r\nzealous in pear cultivation. We are fortunate in having secured to our\r\nnurseries not only the most approved old varieties, but the choicest\r\nnew pears of British, Continental or American origin. A few years ago\r\nto each one hundred apple-trees, our nurseries sold, perhaps, two\r\npear-trees; now they sell at least twenty to a hundred. Very large\r\npear _orchards_ are established, and in some instances are now\r\nbeginning to bear. I purchased Williams’s Bon Chrétien in our market\r\nlast fall for seventy-five cents the bushel. This pear, with the St.\r\nMichael’s, Beurré Diel, Beurré d’Aremberg, Passe Colmar, Duchess\r\nd’Angoulême, Seckel, and Marie Louise, are the most widely diffused,\r\nand all of them regularly at our exhibitions. Every year enables us to\r\ntest other varieties. The Passe Colmar and Beurré d’Aremberg have done\r\nexceedingly well—a branch of the latter, about eighteen inches in\r\nlength, was exhibited at our Fair, bearing over twenty pears, none of\r\nwhich were smaller than a turkey’s egg. The demand for pear-trees,\r\nthis year, has been such that our nurseries have not been able to\r\nanswer it—and they are swept almost entirely clean. I may as well\r\nmention here that, beside many more neighborhood nurseries, there are\r\nin this State eighteen which are large and skillfully conducted.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary cheapness of trees favors their general cultivation.\r\nApple-trees, not under ten feet high, and finely grown, sell at _ten_,\r\nand pears at _twenty_ cents; and in some nurseries, apples may be had\r\nat _six_ cents. This price, it should be recollected, is in a\r\ncommunity where corn brings from twelve to twenty cents only, a\r\nbushel; wheat sells from forty-five to fifty; hay at five dollars the\r\nton. During the season of 1843-’44, apples of the finest sorts\r\n(Jennetting, green Newtown pippin, etc.), sold at my door, as late as\r\nApril, for _twenty-five_ cents a bushel—and dull at that. This winter\r\nthey command _thirty-seven_ cents. Attention is increasingly turned to\r\nthe cultivation of apples for exportation. Our inland orchards will\r\nsoon find an outlet, both to the Ohio River by railroad, and the Lakes\r\nby canal. The effects of such a deluge of fruit is worthy of some\r\nspeculation. It will diminish the price but increase the _profit_ of\r\nfruit. An analogous case is seen in the penny-postage system of\r\nEngland. Fruit will become more generally and largely an article, not\r\nof luxury, but of daily and ordinary diet. It will find its way down\r\nto the poorest table—and the _quantity_ consumed will make up in\r\nprofit to the dealer, what is lost in lessening its price. A few years\r\nand the apple crop will be a matter of reckoning by farmers and\r\nspeculators, just as is now, the potato crop, the wheat crop, the\r\npork, etc. Nor will it create a home market alone. By care it may be\r\nexported with such facility, that the world will receive it as a part\r\nof its diet. It will, in this respect, follow the history of grains\r\nand edible roots, and from a local and limited use, the apple and the\r\npear will become articles of universal demand. The reasons of such an\r\nopinion are few and simple. It is a fruit always palatable—and as\r\nsuch, will be welcome to mankind whatever their tastes, if it can be\r\nbrought within their reach. The western States will, before many\r\nyears, be _forested_ with orchards. The fruit bears exportation\r\nkindly. Thus there will be a _supply_; a possibility of distributing\r\nit by commerce, to meet a taste already existing. These views may seem\r\nfanciful—may prove so; but they are analogical. Nor, if I inherit my\r\nthree score years and ten, do I expect to die, until the apple crop of\r\nthe United States shall surpass the potato crop in value, both for man\r\nand beast. It has the double quality of palatableness, raw or\r\ncooked—it is a _permanent_ crop, not requiring annual planting—and it\r\nproduces more bushels to the acre than corn, wheat, or, on an average,\r\nthan potatoes. The calculations may be made, allowing an average of\r\nfifteen bushels to a tree. The same reasoning is true of the pear; it\r\nand the apple, are to hold a place yet, as universal eatables—a\r\n_fruit-grain_, not known in their past history. If not another tree\r\nshould be set in this county (Marion County), in ten years the annual\r\ncrop of apples will be 200,000 bushels. But Wayne County has double\r\nour number of trees; suppose, however, the ninety counties of Indiana\r\nto have only 25 trees to a quarter section of land, _i. e._ to each\r\n160 acres, the crop, of fifteen bushels a tree, would be nearly _two\r\nmillions_.\r\n\r\nThe past year has greatly increased the cultivation of small fruits in\r\nthe State. Strawberries are found in almost every garden, and of\r\nselect sorts. None among them all is more popular—or more deservedly\r\nso—than Hovey’s Seedling. We have a native white strawberry, removed\r\nfrom our meadows to our gardens, which produces fruit of superior\r\nfragrance and flavor. The crop is not large—but continues gradually\r\nripening for many weeks. The blackberry is introduced to the garden\r\namong us. The fruit sells at our market for from three to five\r\ncents—profit is not therefore the motive for cultivating it, but\r\nimprovement. I have a _white_ variety. “What color is a _black_-berry\r\nwhen it is _green_?” We used to say _red_, but now we have ripe\r\n_black_-berries which are _white_, and _green black_-berries which are\r\n_red_. Assorted gooseberries and the new raspberries, Franconia and\r\nFastolff are finding their way into our gardens. The Antwerps we have\r\nlong had in abundance. If next spring I can produce rhubarb weighing\r\ntwo pounds to the stalk, shall I have surpassed you? I have a\r\n_seedling_ which last year, without good cultivation, produced\r\npetioles weighing from eighteen to twenty ounces. My wrist is not very\r\ndelicate, and yet it is much smaller in girth than they were.\r\n\r\nIn no department is there more decided advance among our citizens than\r\nin floriculture. In all our rising towns, yards and gardens are to be\r\nfound choicely stocked. All hardy bulbs are now sought after.\r\nOrnamental shrubs are taken from our forests, or imported from abroad,\r\nin great variety. Altheas, rose acacia, jasmin, calycanthus,\r\nsnowberry, snowball, sumach, syringas, spicewood, shepherdia, dogwood,\r\nredwood, and other hardy shrubs abound. The rose is an especial\r\nfavorite. The Bengal, Tea and Noisettes bear our winters in the open\r\ngarden with but slight protection. The Bourbon and Remontantes will,\r\nhowever, drive out all old and ordinary varieties. The gardens of this\r\ntown would afford about _sixty_ varieties of roses, which would be\r\nreckoned first rate in Boston or Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWhile New England suffered under a season of drought, on this side of\r\nthe mountains the season was uncommonly fine—scarcely a week elapsed\r\nwithout copious showers, and gardens remained moist the whole season.\r\nFruits ripened from two to three weeks earlier than usual. In\r\nconsequence of this, winter fruits are rapidly decaying. To-day is\r\nChristmas, the weather is spring-like—no snow—the thermometer this\r\nmorning, forty degrees. My Noisettes retain their terminal leaves\r\ngreen; and in the southward-looking dells of the woods, grasses and\r\nherbs are yet of a vivid green. Birds are still here—three this\r\nmorning were singing on the trees in my yard. There are some curious\r\nfacts in the early history of horticulture in this region, which I\r\nmeant to have included in this communication; but insensibly I have,\r\nalready, prolonged it beyond, I fear, a convenient space for your\r\nmagazine. I yield it to you for cutting, carving, suppressing, or\r\nwhatever other operation will fit it for your purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [21] A letter published in Hovey’s Magazine of Horticulture,\r\n     February, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWNE’s AMERICAN POULTRY YARD.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet no man turn up his contemptuous nose at this Treatise until he has\r\ntraced the manifold relations of eggs and capons to cake, company, and\r\ncivilization. Banish the barnyard, and the universal aldermanhood\r\nwould shrink and grow lean; cup-cakes and sponge-cakes, omelets, whips\r\nand legionary confections, would become mere dreams of remembrance.\r\n\r\nEvery friend of the trencher, every notable housewife, complacently\r\nglorious amidst stacks of praised and devoured cake, has an interest\r\nin this book. There is, therefore, a certain interest which every\r\ncivilized community should take in the progress of the great art of\r\nfowl-breeding.\r\n\r\nThere are striking analogies, also, which should be noticed by every\r\ncomparative psychologist. The doctrine of transmigration has some of\r\nits strongest proofs in the Kingdom of Poultry. The glowing comb, the\r\nhaughty carriage, the resplendent tail-feathers, and ostentatious\r\ncrowing of the lord of the barn-yard creation, reveals to the\r\nsagacious reasoner either the origin or destination of many other\r\n“lords of creation.”\r\n\r\nNor can one mistake the resemblances traceable in the gentler sex of\r\nhens. Some there are industrious only in scratching and cackling, but\r\nnervous, gadding, restless; never content at home, never so happy as\r\nwhen at work in a new-made garden, and sagacious always of the very\r\nspots which are most precious in the owner’s eyes. Are these the types\r\nof human busybodies, or are these resemblances only accidental? Others\r\nare discreet, domestic, prolific, useful and happy hens, human and\r\nfeathered. Many there are neglectful. Some fowls are laborious\r\negg-layers, but poor setters; others disdain the pains of laying, but\r\nare quite willing of a leisure summer’s month to set awhile upon other\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nIn the management, too, of their families, can any candid man resist\r\nthe evidence of resemblances and affiliations between hens and\r\nhumanity? Here a hen walks forth from her nest with but a single\r\nchick; the whole farm is too small for her anxious spirit. On this one\r\nprecious pledge she bestows more clucking, more research and\r\nscratching, than a discreet old matron of many broods would upon five\r\nannual generations! And after all, what is the little brat good\r\nfor—lazy and worked for, but never taught to work, it lives a few\r\nmonths petted and spoiled—dies of neglect, or is anatomized by some\r\nscience-loving weasel! Other, and unnatural hens there are, to whom\r\nthe vast brood of peeping, chirping chicks is but a burden. They seem\r\nto have thoughts of their own, and are perplexed and interrupted by\r\nthe cares needful for their household. Could we pry into the secrets\r\nof this race, doubtless there would be found to be literary mothers,\r\ntoo busy for the general good to have much time for special duties. We\r\ncannot stop now to draw out these analogies, so well worthy the study\r\nof mental philosophers; else we should exhibit the distinctions of\r\nrank, race, and culture, in this interesting kingdom. There are nice\r\nquestions of pedigree, there are points in relation to feathers and\r\ntop-knots, combs and spurs, tail-feathers and wing-feathers,\r\nneck-hackles and toes, which are worthy the attention of any Calhoun\r\nof the barn-yard. The more savory but homely considerations of\r\nfattening, slaying, dressing, selling, stuffing, cooking, carving,\r\ndistributing, eating and digestion, must be left to our readers’ own\r\nreflections. Meanwhile, any man that owns a hen, or has a coop in\r\nprospect, may buy this book, certain of his money’s worth.\r\nBook-farming and book-fowling are better than nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [22] Published by A.

We can alter\r\nnothing, and the past is of no use to us except as a lesson for the\r\nfuture. The soil that the plow ripped up, in the spring, has yielded\r\nits harvest, its work is closed, its fruits garnered. The tree whose\r\nboughs grew green when the singing of birds proclaimed that spring was\r\ncome, has ripened its fruit, perfected its growth, its store is\r\ngathered, and its leaves are lying beneath it, and slowly returning to\r\nthe earth from which they sprang. Only here and there, on a bright\r\nmorning, do we see one of those birds which, a few months ago, builded\r\ntheir nest, watched their young, or taught the nestlings how to\r\nfly—young and old, with their grace of motion and sweet notes, are\r\ngone to a fairer clime. These changes one cannot help noticing; and no\r\nmeditative mind can avoid many thoughts which flow out of them. Where\r\nare the harvests garnered which grew in the soil of the human heart?\r\nWhat thoughts and generous purposes have been ripened and stored up\r\nlike fruit, and what ones have fallen and perished like leaves? Our\r\nvernal orchards never stood, within our remembrance, in such a glory\r\nof bloom; yet when the fruit should have set, most of the blossoms\r\nproved vain. And how many good purposes and fair resolutions have so\r\nperished within us! Have we, like the trees which we love and care\r\nfor, made growth, of root and branch? Everything in nature has\r\ngradually assumed a preparation for winter. Those frosts and that ice\r\nwhich would have sent such mischief upon the leaves of summer, now\r\nlie, without harm, upon orchard and garden. Are we ripe and ready,\r\ntoo, for such a winter as adversity brings upon men?\r\n\r\n\r\n     [23] A.D. 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book contains many words that use alternate spellings, are\r\nmisspelled, made-up, or obsolete.
