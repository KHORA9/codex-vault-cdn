LEEDS,\r\n  In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United\r\n  States for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n  New York Printing Company,\r\n  81, 83, _and_ 85 _Centre Street_,\r\n  New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Lectures were not originally written with any view to their\r\npublication; but as they were afterwards requested for publication in the\r\nJournal of the Franklin Institute, and there attracted very favorable\r\nnotice, I believed the rapidly increasing interest in the subject of\r\nventilation would enable the publishers to sell a sufficient number\r\nto pay the expense of their publication; and, if so, that this very\r\nspirit of inquiry which would lead to the perusal of even so small a\r\nwork, might be one step forward towards that much-needed more general\r\neducation on this important subject.\r\n\r\nIt was not my desire to give an elaborate treatise on the subject of\r\nventilation. I believed a few general principles, illustrated in a\r\nfamiliar way, would be much more likely to be read; and, I hoped, would\r\nact as seed-grain in commencing the growth of an inquiry which, when once\r\nstarted in the right direction, would soon discover the condition of the\r\nair we breathe to be of so much importance that the investigation would\r\nbe eagerly pursued.\r\n\r\n                                                               L.

From the very best information we can command, and with\r\nthe most accurate statistics at our disposal, we are forced to the\r\nconclusion that about forty per cent. of all the deaths that are\r\nconstantly occurring are due to the influence of foul air.\r\n\r\nThe Registrar of Records of New York gives nearly half the deaths in\r\nthat city as resulting from this cause.\r\n\r\nThe deaths in this city for 1865, according to the report of the Board\r\nof Health, were seventeen thousand one hundred and sixty-nine; the\r\naverage age of those who died was between twenty-three and twenty-four\r\nyears. It ought to have been twice that, as shown by some districts in\r\nthe city and also in the country, where the houses are so arranged that\r\nthey frequently have good ventilation.\r\n\r\nTaking the deaths caused by foul air at a very low estimate, say forty\r\nper cent. of the whole, (the per centage from that cause is not so great\r\nas in New York,) we have six thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight\r\ndeaths in this city, caused alone by impure air, in one year.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated by physicians that there are from twenty-five to thirty\r\ndays of sickness to every death occurring; there would therefore be\r\nsomething like two hundred thousand days of sickness annually as an\r\neffect of foul air.\r\n\r\nWe all know how very expensive sickness is, but few persons realize\r\nthe enormous aggregate expense of unnecessary sickness in a city like\r\nPhiladelphia.[1]\r\n\r\nThis subject has awakened much interest in Europe of late years, and\r\nhas led to the expenditure of immense sums of money, for the purpose\r\nof improving the sanitary condition of its cities.\r\n\r\nDr. Hutchinson estimated the loss to the city of London, growing out of\r\npreventable deaths and sickness, at twenty millions of dollars annually,\r\nand Mr. Mansfield estimates the loss from this cause to the United\r\nKingdom at two hundred and fifty millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the single State of Massachusetts, an estimate exhibits an annual\r\nloss of over sixty millions of dollars by the premature death of persons\r\nover fifteen years of age.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that a few only of the principal items of expense\r\nincurred by preventable sickness in the city of New York amount to\r\nover five millions of dollars annually.\r\n\r\nAnd if it is thought that Philadelphia is exempt from such enormous\r\nunnecessary expense, just glance at the report of the Board of Health\r\nfor last year, and see how the deaths from disease of the lungs largely\r\nexceed those from any other disease.\r\n\r\nConsumption is almost entirely the result of breathing impure air,--it\r\nis as preventable by the exclusive use of pure air as _maniaa potuor_\r\ndrunkenness is by the exclusive use of pure water. And see, too, what\r\nslaughter among the innocents--over twenty-five per cent. of the whole\r\ndeaths were under one year of age.\r\n\r\nThe infantile mortality is by many considered the most delicate sanitary\r\ntest. But why does such an intelligent community as this so neglect\r\nits own interest?\r\n\r\nThey have listened to and satisfied the first imperative demands of\r\nnature--shelter from the elements and warmth,--and in doing this they\r\nhave not brought into use that much higher order of intellect which can\r\nalone teach them how to supply, in connection with an agreeable warmth,\r\nan abundance of pure air in their otherwise air-tight houses.\r\n\r\nI have been much interested in examining a large collection of tables\r\nof the analysis of air, which accompany a report to Congress, on\r\n\"Warming and Ventilating the Capitol,\" prepared by Thomas U. Walter,\r\nProfessor Henry and Dr. Wetherill. These tables were made by men of\r\nvarious nations, giving the results of their analysis of air taken\r\nfrom all manner of places, from great elevations on the mountains and in\r\nballoons, from the valleys, from the centre of the ocean, and from the\r\nmiddle of the continent, in cities and in the country, in winter and in\r\nsummer, at night and in the day, and also the comparative analysis of the\r\nair _out of doors and in houses_. Believing that these would be of much\r\ninterest and assistance to us in the investigation of the subject under\r\nconsideration, I have had copies made of some of the most interesting.\r\n\r\nThese give the per centage of carbonic acid in the air as the test of\r\nthe amount of impurities in it.\r\n\r\nThis is not an infallible test by any means--there are various other\r\ncauses of deterioration. There is the exhaustion of the oxygen constantly\r\noccurring to support combustion and animal life; there are various other\r\ndeleterious products of combustion and respiration besides carbonic\r\nacid. But, as carbonic acid is always found in certain known proportions\r\nin pure air, and is always formed in certain known quantities by\r\nrespiration or combustion, it is considered by many to give a very fair\r\nindication of the condition of the atmosphere with reference to its\r\ninfluence on animal life or combustion.\r\n\r\nI think one of the most valuable lessons to be learned by the study of\r\nthese tables is the uniform purity of the external atmosphere all over\r\nthe world, even in large cities.\r\n\r\nThis is strikingly illustrated in the case of the analysis of the air\r\nin the city of Manchester.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing in this country like that city, where two millions of\r\ntons of coal are burned annually, the smoke from which fills the air\r\nand stretches like a black cloud far into the country.\r\n\r\nThus, added to the five hundred tons of carbonic acid thrown from the\r\nlungs of its animal life every day, are many times that amount, (some two\r\nthousand tons,) daily, pouring out from its forest of factory chimneys.\r\n\r\nTo this city were the labors of the \"Health of Towns Commission\" first\r\ndirected, to see if they could not find in the air of its streets that\r\nmysterious influence that has caused such alarm throughout the civilized\r\nworld, as the thoughtful and intelligent sanitarian sees one-half of\r\nall his fellow-citizens hurried to untimely graves.\r\n\r\nThey were disappointed, and well might Dr. Smith exclaim, after the\r\nmost thorough and careful investigations, \"How insignificant are the\r\nworks of art in contaminating that vast ocean of air that is constantly\r\nsweeping over the surface of the earth!\" But do not be discouraged:\r\nmore recent investigations have discovered the whereabouts of this\r\npestilential breath.\r\n\r\nI have placed the table of Dr. Angus Smith's analysis of the air of\r\nManchester at the head of the list, and have copied it complete, because\r\nit is the only table that I have examined of the analysis of the air of\r\ntowns in Europe or North America, in which there occurs an amount of\r\ncarbonic acid exceeding ten parts in ten thousand.\r\n\r\nHere we see three such cases in the twenty-eight experiments, one ten,\r\none twelve and one fifteen.\r\n\r\nThe average of the whole is also greater than in any other similar\r\ntables, being about seven and a half parts in ten thousand. This is\r\ncertainly quite a perceptible contamination, pure air containing four\r\nor four and a half parts in ten thousand. Yet considerable as this\r\nappears in this view, the additional amount of carbonic acid is only\r\nthe proportion that would be added to the air, if unchanged, of a room\r\nfifteen feet square and ten feet high, by a father, mother and three\r\nchildren, with a gas-light, in seven minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd this, probably, is the highest average contamination that is produced\r\nby artificial means upon the air of any city in the world.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, great natural causes which affect the air of\r\nwhole countries, such as the decomposition of great masses of vegetable\r\nmatter similar to that occurring on the low flat lands along rivers,\r\nespecially where they overflow their banks, like the Ohio and Mississippi.\r\nThe best system of ventilation, as applicable to this kind of foul air,\r\nis to keep as far out of its reach as possible.\r\n\r\nThe other tables giving the analysis of the air of London, Paris, Madrid,\r\nGeneva, Bolton, England, at different elevations on the mountains, on the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, Washington City and various other places, are interesting\r\nonly because they show so great a uniformity in the carbonic acid, seldom\r\nexceeding six parts to the ten thousand, and seldom under four.\r\n\r\nBut now let us look upon the other side of the room. Here we have tables\r\ngiving the \"carbonic acid in houses.\" Here we will find very different\r\nresults. But the first is a green-house; in that there is no trace\r\nof carbonic acid in the evening and scarcely a trace in the morning.\r\nPlants, you know, absorb the carbonic acid, and give off oxygen, while\r\nanimals absorb the oxygen and give off carbonic acid, thus keeping up\r\nthe equilibrium in nature, as is so beautifully shown in the aquarium.\r\nPlants are generally supposed to give off carbonic acid at night, but\r\nit must be in very small quantities.\r\n\r\nI consider them very conducive to health in a living-room, morally and\r\nphysically.\r\n\r\nBut this want of carbonic acid does not last long.\r\n\r\nThe next is M. Dumas' lecture-room. At commencement of lecture 42.5,\r\nand at close of lecture 67 parts in ten thousand.\r\n\r\nNow, I think we are on the right track for discovering that mysterious\r\npoison that has carried so many of our friends to their graves, even\r\nin the very prime of life.\r\n\r\nHere we have dormitories, 52; do., 37; asylum, 17; school-room, 30;\r\ndo., 56; Chamber of Deputies, 16; Opera Comique, parterre, 15; do.,\r\nceiling, 28; stable, 7; do., 14; hospital, Madrid, 30; do., do., 43;\r\nair of bed-room on rising in the morning, 48; the same after being\r\nventilated two hours, 16; railroad car, 34; workshop, Munich, 19; full\r\nroom, do., 22; lecture-room, 32; beer-saloon, 49; and worst of all is\r\na well-filled school-room, 72 parts of carbonic acid in 10,000.\r\n\r\nThat, I think, is enough. Here we have the solution of the whole mystery.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the external atmosphere that we must look for the greatest\r\nimpurities, but it is in our own houses that the blighting, withering\r\ncurse of foul air is to be found. We are thus led to the conclusion\r\nthat _our own breath is our greatest enemy_.\r\n\r\nThe \"Health of Towns Commission,\" in their investigations, after\r\nexamining various trades, where the employees were confined mostly in\r\nhouses, and having left the scavengers to the last, expecting to find a\r\nrich harvest of mortality among them, were much surprised to find them\r\nmore healthy than many very clean occupations, but which were conducted\r\nin houses instead of in the open air. I have not the statistics before\r\nme, but I should not be surprised to learn that that singular race of\r\nbeings that live in the sewers of Paris were as healthy, if not even\r\nmore so, than the operatives of some of those exquisitely beautiful,\r\nclean, air-tight factories of New England.\r\n\r\nThere was quite an account made a few years ago of the wonderful cures\r\nof consumption that had been performed by the patient being removed to\r\nthe stable where he could be in close proximity to the cow, and I have\r\nno doubt many consumptive patients would find great benefit by such a\r\ncourse of treatment, not that there is any virtue in the smell of the\r\ncow, but that the air of the cow-stable would be nearer pure than that\r\nof their own chamber.\r\n\r\nMany go or send their families to the country in summer to get fresh\r\nair. Some go to the sea-side, others to the mountains; but there ensues\r\na greater change in a few minutes in a close bed-room by being occupied\r\nby a family than there is difference between the external air of any\r\ncity and that of the country.\r\n\r\nThe reason why cities are so much more unhealthy than the country, is\r\nnot because the air in the street is so much more impure, but because\r\nthe houses are so built together that this vast ocean of air cannot\r\nget at and through them to purify them as it does in the houses in the\r\ncountry, and the reason why Philadelphia is so much more healthy than\r\nits neighbor, New York, is because the houses here are built more like\r\nthose of the country, so that the air can sweep all around them, and\r\nsometimes through them.\r\n\r\nI therefore believe, that a family living in the filthiest street in\r\nour city, if they were careful to have a constant current of air from\r\nthat street, filthy as it was, passing through the house at all times,\r\nnight and day, would be more healthy, other things being equal, than\r\na family spending their winters in the finest house, if kept air-tight,\r\nin the healthiest location in the city, and their summer in the country,\r\nespecially if they were always careful to exclude the _night air_ from\r\ntheir bed-rooms.\r\n\r\nI say \"night air;\"--there is, unfortunately, an unnecessary prejudice\r\nagainst what is termed night air, which means, I suppose, fresh external\r\nair from the dark.\r\n\r\nTo show that this is not a new idea, I will read a few lines from the\r\nwritings of a very accurate reasoner and an eminently practical mechanic\r\nand philosopher, one whom I consider even now one of the very best\r\nauthorities upon the subject of heating and ventilation. I mean the\r\nillustrious man after whom this Institute was named, Benjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\nIn his letter to Dr. Ingenhaus, physician to the Emperor, at Vienna,\r\nhe says: * * * * \"for some are as much afraid of fresh air as persons\r\nin the hydrophobia are of fresh water. I myself had formerly this\r\nprejudice--this _aerophobia_, as I now account it,--and dreading the\r\nsupposed dangerous effects of cool air, I considered it an enemy, and\r\nclosed with extreme care every crevice in the rooms I inhabited.\r\nExperience has convinced me of my error. I now look upon fresh air as\r\na friend: I even sleep with an open window. I am persuaded that no common\r\nair from without is so unwholesome as the air within a close room that\r\nhas been often breathed and not changed. Moist air, too, which I formerly\r\nthought pernicious, gives me now no apprehensions; for considering that\r\nno dampness of air applied to the outside of my skin can be equal to what\r\nis applied to and touches it within, my whole body being full of moisture,\r\nand finding I can lie two hours in a bath twice a week, covered with\r\nwater, which certainly is much damper than any air can be, and this\r\nfor years together, without catching cold, or being in any other manner\r\ndisordered by it, I no longer dread mere moisture, either in air, or in\r\nsheets or shirts; and I find it of importance to the happiness of life,\r\nthe being freed from vain terrors, especially of objects that we are\r\nevery day exposed inevitably to meet with.\r\n\r\n\"You physicians have of late happily discovered, after a contrary opinion\r\nhad prevailed some ages, that fresh and cool air does good to persons\r\nin the small-pox and other fevers. It is to be hoped, that in another\r\ncentury or two we may all find out that it is not bad even for people in\r\nhealth. And as to moist air, here I am at this present writing in a ship\r\nwith above forty persons, who have had no other but moist air to breathe\r\nfor six weeks past; everything we touch is damp, and nothing dries, yet\r\nwe are all as healthy as we should be on the mountains of Switzerland,\r\nwhose inhabitants are not more so than those of Bermuda or St. Helena,\r\nislands on whose rocks the waves are dashed into millions of particles,\r\nwhich fill the air with damp, but produce no diseases, the moisture being\r\npure, unmixed with the poisonous vapors arising from putrid marshes and\r\nstagnant pools, in which many insects die and corrupt the water. These\r\nplaces only, in my opinion, (which, however, I submit to yours,) afford\r\nunwholesome air; and that it is not the mere water contained in damp\r\nair, but the volatile particles of corrupted animal matter mixed with\r\nthat water, which renders such air pernicious to those who breathe it;\r\nand I imagine it a cause of the same kind that renders the air in close\r\nrooms, where the perspirable matter is breathed over and over again by\r\na number of assembled people, so hurtful to health.\r\n\r\n\"After being in such a situation many people find themselves affected by\r\nthat _febricula_, which the English alone call a _cold_, and, perhaps,\r\nfrom that name, imagine they have caught the malady by _going out_\r\nof the room, when it was, in fact, by being in it.\"\r\n\r\nNow, to show that his hopes have not yet been fully realized, although\r\none century has nearly closed since he wrote what I have just read,\r\nand this unnecessary and unfortunate prejudice against night air still\r\nprevails extensively, I will read a few lines from the highest public\r\nmedical authority in this city. It is the instructions of the Board of\r\nHealth for the prevention of cholera for 1866:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ARTICLE--\"VENTILATION.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Your premises, particularly sleeping apartments and cellars,\r\n    should be thoroughly ventilated. Ventilation is no less a purifier\r\n    than water.\r\n\r\n    \"It cleanses by oxidizing and drying. Keep your houses open and\r\n    your windows hoisted during the day in good weather, and from ten\r\n    o'clock until four in the afternoon, that they may have the full\r\n    benefit of sunlight and free circulation of pure air. _During\r\n    the remaining hours of the day, and through the night, keep the\r\n    windows closed._ When the weather is cool or rainy, be sure to\r\n    keep a fire in the house, in order to prevent dampness, or in\r\n    sparsely settled neighborhoods, or in the suburbs of the city,\r\n    have a fire in the house the entire season.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 9 we read: \"Be careful to dress comfortably for the season,\r\n_avoid the night air_ as much as possible, and when thus exposed, put\r\non an extra garment and do not go into _the night air_ when in a state\r\nof perspiration.\"\r\n\r\nThus, while recognizing the great value and importance of ventilation in\r\na general way, they give the most definite instructions for thoroughly\r\nand most effectually preventing it, because it is at night, especially\r\nwhen we are asleep and _cannot move from the air, that the air ought\r\nto be moved from us_.\r\n\r\nThe frequent recommendations to avoid \"night air\" are simply\r\nrecommendations to smother ourselves to death, because the foul, poisonous\r\nexhalations from our lungs cannot be removed from our chambers without\r\nbeing replaced by night air; there is no other fresh air at night but\r\nnight air.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation to build a fire in the house on cool days, and in\r\nlow marshy districts every day in the year, is an excellent one.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations to dress warmly and to avoid checking a perspiration\r\nsuddenly, are valuable suggestions and too much attention cannot be\r\npaid to them.\r\n\r\nBut they are of equally great importance in reference to day air as to\r\nnight air.\r\n\r\nTo shelter oneself from the sudden change of temperature after sundown\r\nis an animal instinct, and a very necessary one, which is strongly\r\nimplanted in man and beast alike.\r\n\r\nThe harm comes from the fact of so intelligent and intellectual a body\r\nas the Board of Health of Philadelphia encouraging the accomplishment\r\nof this very desirable object, by thwarting that great universal law\r\nof our Creator, the ceaseless agitation of the air by which it purifies\r\nitself, (and by which perversion of nature's laws millions are already\r\nbeing killed unnecessarily every year,) instead of their encouraging\r\nits accomplishment in that much more healthy and rational way by adding\r\nmore clothing or more fuel to the fire, and still continuing to breathe\r\nthe pure air at night as well as in the day-time.\r\n\r\nI have practised for many years sleeping with my windows open every\r\nnight, summer and winter, allowing the unobstructed breeze to flow\r\nacross my bed, to the great improvement of my health and strength.\r\n\r\nThere is no objection in a well ventilated room to having a fire if\r\ndesired. A small room with a hot stove or open fire and the windows open,\r\nis much more wholesome than a large air-tight room freezing cold.\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate this by a simple experiment. Here we have a very small\r\ntube, in which we place a lighted candle, occupying nearly the entire\r\nspace--this burns brightly, you see.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nHere we have another glass chamber, much handsomer and twenty times\r\nas large; we also place a similar candle in it, that burns with equal\r\nbrightness, but watch them both for a few moments--see how rapidly\r\nthis light in the large chamber diminishes in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThat represents, in a beautiful manner, the diminished force of your\r\nlife in an air-tight room. There it goes--entirely extinguished by\r\nfoul air in so short a time, but the other continues to burn just as\r\nbrightly as when first lighted. The smaller one had the window open,\r\nso to speak; we will imagine the candle in the large chamber to be a\r\nconsumptive patient who thought the room so large he did not need the\r\nwindows open. Remember, therefore, that no matter how small your room\r\nis, if there is a constant circulation of fresh air through it, the lamp\r\nof your life will burn brightly; but if ever so large and air-tight,\r\nyour life will soon be extinguished.\r\n\r\nInstead of averting the cholera by avoiding fresh air at night, the\r\nexperience of the last summer seems to have taught us just the contrary;\r\nfor whilst most physicians admit that they are still unable to explain\r\nsatisfactorily, the cause or remedy for this most mysterious disease,\r\nthat has within a lifetime carried its fifty millions of victims from\r\ntime to eternity, they almost universally believe it is a foul air\r\npoison, and they have as yet found no surer prevention than pure air.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking illustrations of this, and perhaps one of the\r\nmost wonderful cures of cholera on record, was that of the New York\r\nWorkhouse on Blackwell's Island. It lasted only nine days, but in\r\nthat brief period one hundred and twenty-three out of eight hundred\r\ninmates died. I visited the building with Dr. Hamilton, on the third\r\nday after its appearance, but the hospital then contained sixty or\r\nseventy patients, and some twenty-five or thirty had died within\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nDr. Hamilton attributed the rapid propagation and fatality of the\r\ndisease, after it once had gained admission, mainly to confinement and\r\ncrowding. It was observed that the cholera was confined, for several\r\ndays, among the women; the women had the smallest apartments, were most\r\ncrowded in their cells, and with few exceptions, were employed within\r\nthe building, in close contact with each other during the day. The men\r\nwere employed mostly in the quarries and out of doors.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's prescription on that occasion is worth studying. It is\r\nvery short and simple, however.\r\n\r\nA slight change was made in the diet; disinfectants were used; fifteen\r\ndrops of the tincture of capsicum with an ounce of whisky, as a stimulant\r\nat night, was all the medicine given to each individual. But the great\r\nmeans the doctor relied upon for success, was pure air all the time. They\r\nwere kept out of doors from morning until night, and all the windows\r\nwere kept open night and day; and although in the hot weather of summer,\r\nfire was made in the wards, to insure more perfect ventilation. In six\r\ndays after the initiation of these simple hygienic measures, the epidemic\r\nentirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe disorders and sickness caused by the too rapid chilling of the\r\nunprotected body after sundown, have given rise, I have no doubt, to that\r\nerroneous popular prejudice so common among all classes, even those of\r\neducation and ordinarily good common sense, who imagine there is some\r\npeculiar poison or source of unhealthiness in the air at night, that\r\nis not contained in the air in the day-time. It will no doubt greatly\r\nrelieve the minds of these from such \"vain terrors,\" and prove most\r\nconclusively the entire fallacy of such reasoning, to examine these\r\ntables again. In the copies I have made, I have not classified the\r\nresults given by day and by night, but a careful examination in detail,\r\nfails to show any appreciable difference in the aggregate, by day or\r\nby night.\r\n\r\nMene's numerous experiments on the air in Paris, gave less carbonic\r\nacid at night than in the day-time.\r\n\r\nLewey's analysis on the Atlantic ocean, one thousand miles from the coast,\r\ngave a decided excess in the day over that of the night. He attributes\r\nthis to the action of the sunlight upon the ocean liberating the gases\r\nwhich it holds in solution.\r\n\r\nIn cities there is a much larger quantity given off from burning coals\r\nof factories in the day-time than at night.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, however, that the more rapid evaporation of\r\nmoisture towards evening may carry with it the volatile particles of\r\ncorrupted animal and vegetable matter to an extent slightly in excess\r\nof that which occurs in the morning, but it is believed these would not\r\nequal the greater contamination from burning coals, and the usually\r\ngreater stillness of the air, producing partial stagnation, so that\r\nthe air would be a little nearer pure at night than in the day-time.\r\nAnd how unmistakably do all these investigations prove what we ought to\r\nhave known and accepted without a moment's hesitation, that the Creator,\r\nwho has made such vast and such minute provisions for supplying every\r\nliving creature with a constant and copious supply of fresh air, and\r\nhas made it so important for their existence that they cannot live a\r\nmoment without it, has made the air at night just as pure and wholesome\r\nas in the day-time.\r\n\r\nWe have thus traced the scourge of foul air to our houses, and much\r\nof it to our bed-rooms. The next question is, how to get clear of it.\r\n\r\nWe want to know, however, what poisons the air, so as to know in what\r\npart of the room it is to be found.\r\n\r\nWe will try a very simple experiment, to show you what a deadly poison\r\nthe breath is,--to the flame of a candle, at any rate.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple glass tube, open at both ends--an ordinary lamp\r\nchimney--a candle burns freely as you see, and would burn so all night,\r\nif it did not burn out. I will now remove the candle, and breathe into\r\nthe tube through this pipe, and now you see how suddenly the candle is\r\nextinguished as I drop it in again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nAnimals are killed suddenly or after a more prolonged struggle, by the\r\nexhaled breath, according to the activity or sluggishness with which\r\nthe blood circulates--a bird would be killed very soon--some partially\r\ntorpid animals would live a long time. Man has great endurance--struggles\r\nlong and hard; but if closely confined, will be poisoned to death in\r\none night, as in the case of those confined in the celebrated Black\r\nHole of Calcutta, and on board of vessels where they have been confined\r\nbelow decks in time of a storm. Others will struggle on longer, as in\r\nthe case of the two thousand and twenty-six who died of consumption last\r\nyear, in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us see in which part of the room this deadly poison of our\r\nbreath is mostly found.\r\n\r\nIt is the popular idea, that because the body, and consequently the\r\nbreath, is warmer than the ordinary temperature of a room, it rises and\r\naccumulates at the ceiling.\r\n\r\nUpon this theory most of our buildings have been ventilated whenever\r\nany attention whatever has been given to the subject; but that theory\r\nis incorrect; consequently, all practice based thereon is also wrong.\r\n\r\nThis subject of the direction taken by the breath upon leaving the\r\nbody, has been warmly discussed within a few years. It has been a very\r\ndifficult matter to prove conclusively and satisfactorily, but I think\r\nwe have devised some very simple experiments that will prove to you\r\nvery clearly what we have stated.\r\n\r\nI have here a simple glass tube two feet long and one and a half inch\r\ninterior diameter; one end is closed with a rubber diaphragm, through\r\nwhich is passed a small rubber tube--the other end is all open. We will\r\nrest this about horizontal, and taking a little smoke in the mouth, it\r\nwill be discharged with the breath into the glass tube; it is first thrown\r\ntowards the top, but it soon falls, and now see it flowing along the\r\nbottom of the tube like water--watch it as it reaches the far end--there,\r\nsee it fall almost like water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow, by raising the closed end of the pipe, you see we can pour it all\r\nout, and by filling it again and raising the other end, it falls back.\r\nThus you see that, notwithstanding the extra warmth in the breath, it\r\nis heavier than the atmosphere, and falls to the floor of an ordinary\r\nroom like this, say, when the temperature is from 60 deg. to 70 deg.. This is\r\nowing to the carbonic acid and moisture contained in it.\r\n\r\nI have varied this experiment in a number of ways, by passing it through\r\nsmaller tubes and discharging it into the air in one or two seconds\r\nafter leaving the lungs, and by passing it through water of various\r\ntemperatures, and discharging it into rooms of different temperatures,\r\nwith the same general results. As the temperature of the air diminishes,\r\nthe tendency of the discharged breath to rise increases. Much care is\r\nrequired in conducting these experiments, to avoid as much as possible,\r\nthe local currents which are always present in a room.\r\n\r\nThis is a very important fact to be borne in mind; yet notwithstanding\r\nthis, there are times, under certain circumstances, in which the foul\r\nair will be found in excess at the top of the room.\r\n\r\nFor the further examination of this subject, we have here a little\r\nglass-house with glass chimneys and fire-place in the first and second\r\nstories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs the flame of a candle is such a beautiful emblem of human life,\r\nwe will remove the roof and part of the floor of the second story,\r\nand place four candles in our house. They are all of different heights,\r\nyou see. We will call them a father, mother and two children.\r\n\r\nAs carbonic acid is that much dreaded poison in our breath, and the\r\nheavy portion of it which causes it to fall to the floor, we will make\r\na little by placing a few scraps of common marble in this glass vessel,\r\nand pouring over it some sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nIt is now forming, and will fall and flow across the floor the same\r\nas carbonic acid does when it pours into a basement from the gutters\r\non the street or filthy yards where it is formed, and before it is\r\nabsorbed or diluted by the current of pure air sweeping over them.\r\nIt first kills the smallest child, because it is nearest the floor. You\r\nremember the excessive infantile mortality in this city in 1865. This is\r\npartially owing to their breathing more of this foul air near the floor,\r\nand partially owing to the great fear of their mothers and nurses,\r\nof letting the little innocents get a breath of fresh air for fear it\r\nwill give them colic, and consequently they smother them to death.\r\n\r\nThe other child dies next, and then the mother, and lastly the father.\r\n\r\nThousands are thus poisoned to death by their own breath every year.\r\nBut did you ever see a physician's certificate that gave you any such\r\nidea? Why do not the doctors tell the living, in such language as they\r\ncan understand, what killed their friends, so they may avoid it in\r\ntheir own case, instead of giving it in some Latin terms which I fear\r\nmany interpret to mean some special dispensation of Divine Providence\r\ninstead of the true cause--their utter disregard of the laws their\r\nCreator made for the preservation of their health?\r\n\r\nHad this family known enough about ventilation to have kept the\r\nfire-place open, with a little fire in it now and then, they would not\r\nhave been thus killed.\r\n\r\nLet us see--we will take out the fire-board which has been put in to\r\nmake the room look a little neater, and with a very small light there\r\nto create a draft in the chimney.\r\n\r\nWe will again light the candles, and pour in the poisonous breath.\r\nAh! there goes the little one--he is hardly high enough to keep out of\r\nthat deadly current flowing across the floor.\r\n\r\nWe shall have to let it in a little slower, or we will set him on\r\na platform, as many persons who have carefully studied this subject,\r\nconsider it judicious to do. Now, by the smoke from this taper, you can\r\nsee the air is flowing across the floor and up the chimney.\r\n\r\nThere has been a steady current flowing in long enough to have filled\r\nthe house, but the lights are all burning brightly, and you thus see\r\nthe value of an open fire-place for ventilation. Thousands of lives are\r\nthus saved, and many more would be if all fire-places were kept open. I\r\nhave recommended hundreds of fire-boards to be cut up for kindling-wood,\r\nas I consider this is the best use that can be made of all fire-boards.\r\n\r\nNever stop up a fire-place in winter or summer, where any living being\r\nstays night or day. It would be about as absurd to take a piece of\r\nelegantly tinted court-plaster and stop up the nose, trusting to the\r\naccidental opening and shutting of the mouth for fresh air, because\r\nyou thought it spoiled the looks of your face so to have two such great\r\nugly-looking holes in it, as it is to stop your fire-place with elegantly\r\ntinted paper because you think it looks better.\r\n\r\nIf you are so fortunate as to have a fire-place in your room, paint it\r\nwhen not in use; put a bouquet of fresh flowers in every morning, if you\r\nplease, or do anything to make it attractive; but never close it.\r\n\r\nNow, there are other conditions in which a fire-place or an opening near\r\nthe floor, will not answer for ventilation. This occurs in rooms where\r\nthe air is made impure by burning lamps or gas, and where the fresh\r\nair entering the room is cooler than the temperature of the room itself.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, we will put the roof on and take the entire floor\r\naway, or as it will be a little more convenient, we will represent it\r\nby this glass-house, using this shade for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is supported some six inches from the floor, and has no bottom.\r\nBy lighting another candle and standing it outside, you can judge by\r\ncomparison, of the foulness of the air inside.\r\n\r\nThe tallest one is affected first, this time. You see that is a perfectly\r\nformed light, but it gives but about half the light the one does on the\r\noutside; this is the way with many of us who are obliged to, or rather\r\ndo, breathe foul air half the time.\r\n\r\nWe often think, by comparing ourselves with others around us, that we\r\nare pretty fair specimens of humanity, while really we do not give more\r\nthan half the light in the world that we ought to do, and kill ourselves\r\nbefore our work is half done.\r\n\r\nYou see the two tallest are dead already, and the others will soon\r\nfollow--there they go. Here is the bottom of the house removed, and\r\nyet these candles all went out for want of fresh air.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when we see the air is made impure by burning candles or gas\r\nlights, owing to its exceeding heat, the foul air is mostly at the top\r\nof the room, and especially when the fresh air enters cooler than the\r\nair in the room. We will find, however, that in a very few minutes the\r\ncandles will relight long before the contained air or the glass shade\r\ncools down to the temperature of the room.\r\n\r\nThe products of combustion, like those of respiration, are heavier than\r\nthe ordinary atmosphere, and consequently fall to the floor very soon\r\nif not removed while very hot, by special openings immediately over\r\nthem in the ceiling; after it has thus fallen, provision must be made\r\nfor its removal from the level of the floor, in connection with the\r\nfoul air from the breath.\r\n\r\nI hope that by these few simple experiments, and the statistics presented\r\nhere this evening, we have strengthened your previous convictions of\r\nthe importance of fresh air, because we are well aware that you will\r\nfind, as you proceed in your investigations of this subject, that it\r\nis frequently surrounded with complications; yet the laws governing\r\nthe circulation of air of different temperatures, are as fixed and\r\nimmovable as the laws governing the rising and setting of the sun,\r\nand with a very little careful investigation, can be easily understood.\r\n\r\nAnd we believe no similar amount of money or thought, will produce a\r\ngreater amount of satisfaction than the increased health, strength and\r\nhappiness thus secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I stated in our last lecture, much interest is being awakened, in this\r\ncountry and in Europe, by recent investigations showing the enormous\r\nnumbers of untimely deaths that are caused throughout all classes of\r\nsociety by foul air.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a startling announcement, ten years ago, to have\r\nstated that impure air caused as many deaths, and as much sickness,\r\nas all other causes combined, and yet the most diligent and accurate\r\ninvestigations are rapidly approaching that conclusion.\r\n\r\nFew really comprehend the immense pecuniary loss, to say nothing of the\r\namount of suffering, that we endure by this extra and easily preventible\r\namount of sickness.\r\n\r\nI propose, this evening, to enter upon the consideration of one of the\r\nmost important parts of our subject--_the effect produced by_ HEAT _upon\r\nthe movements of air_.\r\n\r\nI think it probable that many of us do not comprehend the actual reality\r\nof the air.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to say of a room that has no carpet and furniture in it,\r\nthat it has nothing in it, while, if it is full of air, it has a great\r\ndeal in it.\r\n\r\nA room between twenty-seven and twenty-eight feet square contains one\r\nton of air--a real ton, just as heavy as a ton of coal. Now, there is\r\nnot only twenty-seven feet, but more than twenty-seven miles of air\r\npiled on top of us. The pressure of the atmosphere at the level of the\r\nocean is about fifteen pounds to the square inch. An ordinary sized\r\nman sustains a pressure of about fifteen tons, and were it not that\r\nthis pressure is equal in all directions, we would be crushed thereby.\r\n\r\nWe must accustom our minds, therefore, to consider air a real substance,\r\nand that it is as totally unable to move itself, or to be moved, without\r\n_power_, as water or coal. It requires just as much power to move a ton\r\nof _air_ from the cellar to the second story, as it does a ton of coal.\r\n\r\nHeat is the great moving power of air. Those whose attention has not\r\nbeen especially directed to the subject of the amount of power exerted by\r\nthe sun's rays upon the earth, have little conception of its magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe power of all the horses in the world, added to the power of all the\r\nlocomotives, and of all the immense steam engines in all the world,\r\nexpress but a small fraction of the power exerted by the sun's rays\r\nupon the earth. It is estimated to be sufficient to boil five cubic\r\nmiles of ice-cold water every minute.\r\n\r\nHis rays are the chosen power of the Creator for moving all matter\r\nupon the globe. It is his rays that lie buried in the vast coal fields\r\nbeneath the earth. His rays cause every spear of grass to grow, rear\r\nthe mighty oak, form the rose, burst its beautiful buds, and send its\r\nperfume through the air.\r\n\r\nNo bird warbles its sweet music in the air, no insect breathes, save by\r\nhis power, and all animals love to bask in the genial glow of his light\r\nand heat. He rolls the scorching air of the tropics to frozen lands,\r\nand wafts the ships across the seas. He forces the heated waters of the\r\nequator to the poles, tempering all the earth. He lifts the water from\r\nthe sea to sprinkle all the land and cap the distant mountains with\r\neternal snow.\r\n\r\nNow, let us examine a little more minutely how this influence is exerted\r\nupon the _air_, which is the subject we are especially interested in\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nDoes it commence at the top, and heat it, layer by layer, until it reaches\r\nthe bottom? Not at all; but it passes through the whole forty-five\r\nmiles of air, heating it very little, if any, and falls upon the solid\r\nsubstances at the earth's surface, heating them, which, in turn, heat the\r\nair by its individual particles coming into immediate contact with those\r\nsolid hotter substances.\r\n\r\nWe will endeavor to illustrate this in a crude way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nHere we have a tin tube, _a_, fifteen feet long and ten inches in\r\ndiameter, open at both ends; two feet from one end we introduce this\r\nascending pipe, _b_, the upper end of which is merely inserted in a\r\nsmall flue, extending to the top of the building. The height of this\r\nflue is sufficient to make a current of air pass through this tube,\r\nas you will see by holding this smoking taper at the far end. We will\r\nnow place a large heated ball, _c_, at this end, and outside of that we\r\nwill place this reflector, _d_, pressing it quite close to the end of\r\nthe tube, so that no air can enter here.\r\n\r\nThe rays of heat from this ball, or from any other warm body, are thrown\r\nlike rays of light, in every direction equally; there would, therefore,\r\nbe some of the rays thrown through this tube to the other end without\r\nany reflector, but the proportion that would reach the other end would,\r\nof course, be small.\r\n\r\nWe therefore collect those going the other way, and change their course,\r\nand then send them straight through the tube to the far end.\r\n\r\nWe will place another reflector, _e_, at the far end, to receive and\r\nconcentrate those rays, in the focus of which we will place a candle,\r\nF, with a little phosphorus on it, to show you that the rays of heat are\r\npassing through.\r\n\r\nThere you see the candle is lighted, thus proving that there is a\r\nstrong current of radiant heat coming from the hot ball, through the\r\ntube to this end. And you see by this smoke that there is a current of\r\nair passing the other way.\r\n\r\nNow, we want to know how much that air is heated in passing the whole\r\nlength of this tube against that shower of radiant heat, or whether air\r\nabsorbs radiant heat at all; but, before going to the other end, where\r\nthe hot ball is, we will take two thermometers that have been lying here,\r\nside by side, both indicating a temperature of 69 deg.. One of them, _g_,\r\nwe will hang at this end, about opposite to the centre of our tube,\r\nwhich, I think, will give us a fair average of the entering air, first\r\nremoving, however, the candle that has been lighted, and the reflector.\r\n\r\nWe will hang the other thermometer in the ascending tube, at the end\r\nnear the heated ball. We have had two glasses, H, inserted here, so\r\nthat we might observe what was going on within by the smoke from this\r\ntaper. You see there is a strong current of air passing up the tube,\r\nall of which must come from the far end, flowing against the strong\r\ncurrent of radiant heat going in the opposite direction. Now, leaving\r\nthis thermometer to rise or fall according to the temperature of the\r\nair flowing through, we will go to the other end and examine another\r\nvery interesting part of this experiment: it is the manner in which the\r\nradiant heat is received and appropriated by different substances.\r\n\r\nRadiant heat is thrown from a hot body in every direction equally, but\r\nno two kinds of substances receive those rays of heat in the same manner,\r\nnor do they make the same use of them after they have received them.\r\n\r\nEvery substance receiving heat, however, must give a strict account of\r\nit. It must give out an equal amount of heat, or, what is taken as an\r\nequivalent, some action or power.\r\n\r\nI have a sheet of ordinary tin, and as I hold this polished side behind\r\nthis light, you see it throws a belt of light across the room; and as\r\nI put it in front of the end of our tube, and turn it so that the rays\r\nof heat will be reflected in your faces, I think some of you will be\r\nable to feel the reflected heat. The rays of heat are turned from their\r\ncourse, and thrown in a belt of light across the room, similar to the\r\nrays of light.\r\n\r\nBut you cannot give away and keep the same thing. This bright polished\r\nsurface appropriates but a very small portion of the radiant heat. A\r\nthermometer hanging for some minutes against the back has scarcely risen\r\none degree; but we have given the other side a coating of lamp black,\r\nwith a little varnish, and by turning that side towards the pipe, the\r\nresult will be quite different. By this coat of black varnish the whole\r\ncharacter of the sheet of tin is changed. The black, however, has but\r\nlittle to do with it; if it were white, or red, or blue, the formation\r\nof the surface being similar in every respect, the result would be the\r\nsame almost precisely.\r\n\r\nInstead of acting merely as a guide-post, to _change_ the _direction\r\nonly_ of the rays of heat, as before, it now becomes a receiving depot,\r\nabsorbing nearly all the heat that comes to it. It must soon become\r\nfilled, however. The thermometer hanging at the back has risen six\r\ndegrees already, and is going up rapidly; it must soon begin to distribute\r\nits extra stores. But mark the different manner of distributing the\r\nheat. Instead of _reflecting_ the whole all in one direction, as when\r\nreceived on the other side, it now _radiates_ them equally in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nSome solid substances allow the rays, both of heat and light, to pass\r\ndirectly through them without either reflecting or absorbing them. Other\r\nsubstances allow the rays of light to pass through them, but absorb much\r\nof the radiant heat, like clear glass.\r\n\r\nRock salt is one of the best non-absorbents of radiant heat, allowing\r\nnearly the whole of the rays of heat to pass through unobstructed.\r\n\r\nWe will now return to our experiment at the other end of the tube. I\r\nfind there is something wrong here--the mercury in the thermometer has\r\nrisen several degrees. I knew this was rather a crude arrangement for\r\nillustrating this very beautiful and interesting part of our subject,\r\nbut I hoped it would assist me a little in conveying to you the idea I\r\ndesired to impress upon your minds. I find, however, that it is scarcely\r\ndelicate enough to illustrate perfectly what I wanted to show.\r\n\r\nBut this increased temperature is not owing to the effect of radiant\r\nheat on the air coming from the far end, for I find by the heat at the\r\ntop of the pipe, between the heated ball and this ascending pipe, I, and\r\nby the current of heated air on the side next the ball, that there is\r\na current of _circulating air_ that _has been heated_ by coming into\r\nimmediate _contact_ with the hot ball.\r\n\r\nI designed this smaller tube, _k_, to carry off the air thus heated, but\r\nit appears to be too small.\r\n\r\nWe ought to have had a piece of rock-salt to have closed the end of\r\nthis tube, so that the radiant heat would have passed through without\r\nallowing any _circulation_ of _heated air_, but I was unable to find\r\nsuch a piece. But Professor Tyndall, in his lectures before the Royal\r\nInstitute of Great Britain, gives the results of a large number of very\r\naccurate and beautiful experiments tried for the purpose of determining\r\nwhether the forty-five miles of atmosphere surrounding the earth absorbed\r\n_any_ of the sun's rays, and if so, how much?\r\n\r\nThese experiments prove, in the most conclusive manner, that dry pure\r\nair is almost a perfect non-absorbent of radiant heat. Thus, were the\r\nair entirely dry and pure, the whole forty-five miles through which the\r\nsun's rays have to pass, would absorb a very small fraction thereof,\r\nso that in the length of our tube it would be but an exceedingly small\r\nfraction of one degree, that is, for pure dry air.\r\n\r\nBut is the air of this room pure and dry? Very far from it.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall found that the moisture alone in the air of an ordinary\r\nroom, absorbed from fifty to seventy times as much of the radiant heat\r\nas the air does. Air and the elementary gases--oxygen, hydrogen and\r\nnitrogen--have no power of absorbing radiant heat, but the compound\r\ngases have a very different effect; for instance, olifiant gas absorbs\r\n7950 times as much as air; ammonia, 7260; sulphurous acid, 8800 times.\r\nPerfumes, also, have a wonderful power of absorbing radiant heat.\r\n\r\nThe moisture in the air, however, is of the greatest practical importance\r\nin various ways. It is the great governor or regulator or conservator\r\nof heat; it absorbs it and carries it from point to point and into\r\nplaces where the direct rays of the sun could not get; it is like a\r\nsoft invisible blanket constantly wrapped around us, which protects us\r\nfrom too sudden heating or too sudden cooling.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall, speaking of the moisture in the air, says: \"Regarding\r\nthe earth as a source of heat, no doubt at least ten per cent. of its\r\nheat is intercepted within ten feet of its surface.\" He also says:\r\n\"The removal for a single summer's night of the aqueous vapor from the\r\natmosphere which covers England, would be attended by the destruction\r\nof every plant which a freezing temperature could kill.\r\n\r\n\"In Sahara, where the soil is fire and the wind is flame, the\r\nrefrigeration is painful to bear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in many of our furnace-heated houses, we have an atmosphere very\r\nsimilar in point of dryness to that of Sahara, but more impure.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks in regard to the impossibility of heating air,\r\napply especially to radiant heat. Air does become heated, but in\r\na different manner; it is heated by each individual particle or atom\r\ncoming in immediate contact with some hotter substance. See what a\r\nwonderful provision for creating a constant circulation of the air.\r\nThe sun's rays pass through it without heating it, but they heat the\r\nsurface of the earth at the very bottom of the ocean of air; this, in its\r\nturn, heats the air by each individual atom coming in immediate contact\r\nwith these hotter substances, expanding them so that they must rise,\r\nthus enabling the colder and heavier particles to rush in and take their\r\nplaces. With this great universal moving cause, in connection with the\r\ninnumerable minor causes resulting from the very different absorbing,\r\nradiating and reflecting powers of various substances, it becomes\r\nalmost impossible for the air to be entirely and absolutely at rest,\r\neven in the most minute crack or cranny, or bottle corked air-tight.\r\n\r\nNow, to apply these principles to every-day life, to the heating and\r\nventilation of our houses, taking the _open fire_ first, we find that\r\nit acts like the sun, heating exclusively by direct radiation. The rays\r\nof heat fall upon the sides of the room, the floor and ceiling, and\r\nthe solid substances in the room, which thus become partially heated,\r\nand in their turn become _secondary radiators_. This radiant heat from\r\nthe fire does not heat the air in the room at all, but the air becomes\r\npartially warmed by coming in immediate contact with the sides of the\r\nroom, the furniture, &c.\r\n\r\nOne great reason, therefore, why an open fire is so much more wholesome\r\nthan any other means of artificial heating, is because it more nearly\r\nimitates the action of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe rays of heat fall upon our bodies, heating them, while it leaves the\r\nair cool, concentrated and invigorating for breathing. The bright glow\r\nof an open fire has a very cheering and animating effect. It produces\r\na very agreeable and healthy excitement.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that future careful investigations may prove that\r\nthere is an important change takes place in the electric or ozonic\r\ncondition of air as it passes over, or in contact with, hot iron, which\r\ndoes not occur to the air of a room heated by the open fire.\r\n\r\nThe air in a room heated by an open fire can scarcely become stagnant,\r\nbecause that fire must necessarily be constantly drawing a considerable\r\namount of air from the room to support combustion, the place of which\r\nwill be supplied by other air, and here is where one of the greatest\r\ninconveniences arises in the use of the open fire; if the air entering\r\nto supply this exhaustion comes in at a crack of the door or window,\r\non the opposite side of the room, and that air is cold, say 10 deg. or 15 deg.\r\nabove zero, it flows across the floor to the fire, chilling the feet\r\nand backs of those sitting in its track. It is quite possible to roast\r\na goose or round of beef in front of a fire, while the air flowing by\r\nit into the fire is freezing cold. This should be remedied by having\r\nthe air flowing in partially warmed before it enters, say to a\r\ntemperature of 40 deg. to 50 deg., either by having the halls overflowed by\r\npartially warmed air, and opening a door into it, or by admitting the air\r\nto enter around the back of the fire-place, as Dr. Franklin arranged it.\r\n\r\nThus, while an open fire is the healthiest known means of heating a\r\nsmall room, and should be in the family sitting-room of every house,\r\nand in offices and other places where the occupants are at liberty to\r\nmove closer or further from the fire at pleasure, yet it is entirely\r\nunsuitable for a large building, or for rooms where many persons are\r\nassembled, and have fixed seats, similar to a school, lecture-room,\r\nfactory, &c.\r\n\r\nA stove in a room heats both by direct radiation and by heating the air\r\nthat comes in immediate contact with it.\r\n\r\nBut our latest styles of elegant new patent gas-consuming air-tight\r\nstoves, require so small an amount of air to support combustion, that\r\nthere is a strong probability of the occupants of a room thus heated\r\nsmothering to death for want of fresh air, sooner or later, and generally\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nBut a stove, if properly used, creates a comfortable and wholesome\r\natmosphere, and is one of the most economical means of heating now\r\nknown. There should always be a separate pipe for introducing the fresh\r\nair from the external atmosphere, which fresh and cold air should be\r\ndischarged on or near the top of the stove. And if this supply of fresh\r\nair is abundant, with a constant evaporation of moisture sufficient to\r\ncompensate for the increased capacity therefor due to the additional\r\nheat given it, and an opening into a heated flue near the ceiling, to be\r\nopened in the evening when the gas-lights are burning, or when the room\r\nis too hot, and kept shut at all other times, with another opening into\r\na heated flue on a level with the floor, which should be kept _always\r\nopen_ to carry off the cold, heavy foul air from the floor--a stove\r\nthus arranged for many small isolated rooms, makes one of the most\r\neconomical as well as most comfortable and wholesome means of heating\r\nat our command. It combines the three great essentials necessary for\r\ncomfort and health--_warmth_, partially by direct radiation, _fresh air_\r\nand _moisture_. But neither the open fire nor the stove, as desirable as\r\nthey may be in many small rooms, are suitable for large rooms, especially\r\nwhere many persons are assembled. Heating principally by circulating\r\nwarmed air, or in combination with direct radiation from exposed pipes\r\nfilled with steam or hot water, is in such cases more convenient.\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with this system of heating by circulating warm air,\r\nthat the erroneous views in relation to ventilation generally entertained\r\nby the public, produce the most injurious effects.\r\n\r\nThe special points to be borne in mind in considering this subject are\r\nthat, when in motion, warmer air rises and colder air falls; but when at\r\nrest, the stratums of air of different temperatures arrange themselves\r\nhorizontally.\r\n\r\nOne other thing: we must remember _temperature_ has nothing to do with the\r\npurity or impurity of the air. The pure air entering a room is _sometimes_\r\ncolder than the average temperature of the room, and falls to the floor,\r\nforcing the warmer, and, in that case, fouler air to the upper part of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nBut frequently, in winter, the fresh air enters _warmer_ than the average\r\ntemperature of the room, and _rises to the ceiling_, and flows across\r\nthe room above the colder and fouler air that has been longer in the\r\nroom. You must not forget the experiments in our first lecture, showing\r\nthat the breath in an ordinary room, of a temperature of 70 deg., fell to\r\nthe floor instead of rising to the ceiling. I propose illustrating this\r\npart of our subject, by using a little glass room to show the movements\r\nof air of different temperatures. We can either use air of different\r\ntemperatures, showing the motion of the various currents by a little\r\nsmoke; or, as the laws governing the circulation of liquids of different\r\ndensities are so similar, and by the use of a little coloring matter\r\nwill express to an audience of this kind more promptly and clearly the\r\nideas which we wish to convey, we therefore propose using the different\r\ncolored liquids this evening.\r\n\r\nThe colors, of course, have nothing to do with the densities, but are\r\nmerely used as a convenient method of designation; the red representing\r\nheat or rarity, and blue, coldness or density.\r\n\r\nThe room is now filled with clear water, slightly blue, to represent\r\ncold, and a little salt, which makes it a little more dense than fresh\r\nwater. Now, I will let in at the top a little fresh water, colored\r\nred by cochineal, to represent heat, and by making a similar opening\r\non the opposite side for its escape, you will be able readily to see\r\nin what direction it moves. There, see it entering--see how it flows\r\ndirectly across the top of the room, and escapes at the opening on the\r\nopposite side. You see it disturbs the lower and colder parts of the\r\nroom but very little. Thus a large flow of pure fresh warm air might be\r\ngoing through a room all day, and be entirely wasted, neither warming\r\nnor ventilating it. Fortunately, there are but few buildings arranged in\r\nquite so absurd a manner as this. I believe it was tried in the House of\r\nLords, on the erection of the new Houses of Parliament, but, of course,\r\nfailed. I think they still adhere to it in some of the wards of some\r\nInsane Asylums, where they depend, I suppose, upon the excitement of the\r\npatients to keep themselves warm and the air stirred up. I also noticed\r\nthis arrangement in a new building just being finished, a few years\r\nsince, at Yale College. The architects of that building had probably been\r\nimpressed with the dreadful effects upon the health of students of the\r\nair from our ordinary hot air furnaces, and thought they would avoid all\r\nsuch danger. I think, however, it would have answered their purpose just\r\nas well, and been much more economical, to have placed the furnaces at\r\nthe coal mines, and saved the trouble and expense of carrying the coal so\r\nfar. I expect they have made other arrangements, probably, by this time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nWe will now close the opening at the top for the _inlet_ of the fresh\r\nwarmed air, and open a valve, so as to allow it to flow in at the bottom.\r\nWe will allow the opening at the top for the _outlet_ of the foul(?)\r\nair to remain as before, (see Fig. 1, Lithograph plates.) This is quite\r\nan improvement; it agitates the air much more than the other, and by\r\ngoing and standing directly over the register, you can always get in the\r\ncurrent of fresh warm air. But you see to what a very small portion of\r\nthe room the heated air is confined, rising in one perpendicular column\r\ndirectly to the ceiling, and then flowing horizontally along the ceiling\r\nto the outlet. How little it disturbs the main portions of the room,\r\nespecially the lower and occupied part.\r\n\r\nI hope you will notice that this illustrates the popular notions of\r\nventilation. I suppose three-fourths of all the buildings in this country,\r\nor in Europe, where any attempts at artificial ventilation have been made,\r\nare thus arranged. Dr. Franklin knew better, and made a much more perfect\r\narrangement than this. But we are probably mostly indebted to that very\r\nable and enthusiastic advocate of ventilation, Dr. Reid, for this popular\r\nopinion. The whole of the plan that he advocated is but little understood\r\nby the public. He assumed that the natural warmth of the body created an\r\nascending current around us, and caused the breath to rise towards the\r\nceiling, and consequently, in all artificial arrangements, it was best\r\nto endeavor to imitate this natural movement of the air. And to overcome\r\nthe great practical difficulty we see here exhibited, of the fresh warm\r\nair flowing through the room, and disturbing so small a portion of it, he\r\nproposed making the whole floor one register, and thus have an ascending\r\ncolumn over the entire room. For this purpose, the floors in the Houses\r\nof Parliament were perforated by hundreds of thousands of gimlet holes,\r\nand the whole cellar made a hot air chamber. This was a magnificent\r\nidea, and, I believe, in some few instances, where fully carried out,\r\nhas given a good degree of satisfaction; but it is always difficult to\r\nadjust the opening and the pressure so as to cause an even flow over\r\nso large a surface, and at the same time to be so gentle as not to be\r\noffensive to those with whom it comes in contact. But this thorough\r\ndiffusion cannot be conveniently applied in one case in a thousand. It\r\nmust necessarily be always very extravagant, as it will constantly require\r\na great amount of air to insure a thorough circulation through all parts\r\nof the room. I wish, therefore, most emphatically, to condemn all systems\r\nrelying upon openings in the ceiling for the escape of the foul air,\r\nwhile depending upon the circulation of warmed air for obtaining the\r\nnecessary additional warmth. In practice they are universally closed\r\nin winter, for the purpose of keeping warm, and as such openings have\r\nbeen so generally considered the _only_ ones necessary for the proper\r\nventilation of a room, and as they had to be shut in winter, just when\r\nartificial ventilation was most necessary, it has created a very strong\r\nprejudice in the popular mind against all ventilation.\r\n\r\nThe result of the advocacy of these impracticable theories by so many\r\nable and learned men, (most physicians writing upon this subject have\r\nadopted them,) has been the shutting up of many thousands and tens of\r\nthousands, till they have smothered to death.\r\n\r\nThe ravages of consumption and the excessive infantile mortality, and the\r\nmany diseases resulting from foul air poisons, are in a great measure\r\ndue to the general advocacy of these false theories. As I have before\r\nsaid, Dr. Franklin knew better than this, and had we been contented to\r\nhave followed his simple practical advice, instead of being dazzled by\r\nthe splendid theories of others, thousands of our friends would now be\r\nwith us who died long since for the want of fresh air.\r\n\r\nNow, let us see how Dr. Franklin says a room ought to be ventilated.\r\nHe says, \"the fresh air entering, becoming warmed and specifically\r\nlighter, is forced out into the rooms, rises by the mantel-piece to the\r\nceiling, and spreads all over the top of the room, whence, being crowded\r\ndown gradually by the stream of newly warmed air that follows and rises\r\nabove it, the whole room becomes in a short time equally warmed.\" This is\r\nthe principle upon which his celebrated Franklin stove was arranged. Now,\r\nlet us see if we can arrange our little glass house so as to illustrate\r\nthis. We will first fill it with what we call our cold air, and will\r\nclose the outlet at the top, and take out the fire-board. Now, as I\r\nlet in the warm fresh air, it rises immediately to the top, as before,\r\nand flows across the ceiling, but as it cannot escape there, it forces\r\nthe cold air down, and causes it to flow out at the fire-place. See how\r\nquickly the whole room is filled with the fresh warmed air. Ah! I see\r\nI am a little too fast--there appears to be a stratum of a foot or two,\r\nlying on the floor, that is not disturbed yet. It flows out at the top\r\nof the fire-place, and therefore does not reach to the floor. This is\r\nfrequently the cause of cold feet and much discomfort. We will make the\r\nopening directly at the floor, (see Fig. 2, Lithograph plate,) and that\r\nforces all the cold air out, warming and ventilating the whole room. Here\r\nis the whole problem solved in the most beautiful and simple manner.\r\nAnd you may exclaim, as you see the simplicity and perfect working of\r\nthis, how came any one ever to think of anything else.\r\n\r\nHere, again, you see the value of that most excellent and valuable of\r\nhousehold arrangements, the open _fire-place_; even without the fire it\r\nserves a most important purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\nWe must not forget, however, that there are other circumstances in\r\nwhich it will not do to depend on the fire-place alone for ventilation.\r\nNow, by leaving the fire-place open, just as it is, and the room full\r\nof warm air, we will simply change the _condition_ of the air supplied,\r\nand allow cold air to flow in at the bottom instead of the top. (See Fig.\r\n3.) There, you see the fresh _cold_ air simply falls to the bottom and\r\nflows across the floor, without disturbing the upper part of the room at\r\nall. It acts just the reverse of the hot air let in and taken out at the\r\ntop of the room. When you are ventilating a room by _opening a window_,\r\ntherefore, it is often necessary to open it at the top; but remember\r\nwhen you are ventilating by doors and windows, (which are the great\r\nnatural ventilators,) _they_ are an entire substitute for flues--flues\r\nare then of no account. All _windows_, therefore, ought to be made to\r\n_lower from the top_, and all ventilating _flues_ ought to be made to\r\n_open at the bottom_ of the room.\r\n\r\nI have noticed another very interesting feature in regard to the\r\ncirculation of liquids of different densities; for instance, suppose we\r\nfill our little room half full with salt water, and the remainder with\r\nfresh water, we will now apply a spirit lamp to the bottom of the room.\r\nAs the salt water becomes heated it rises rapidly, yet not to the top of\r\nthe room, but only half-way, or to the top of the denser liquid, and then\r\nspreads across the room horizontally. Thus the salt water will keep up\r\na rapid circulation, and may be heated almost to a boiling temperature\r\n_underneath_, and without heating or disturbing, the cold fresh water\r\n_above_. I have tried some very beautiful experiments of this kind with\r\na number of liquids of different densities in the same vessel. Gases\r\nof different densities are probably influenced in a similar manner by\r\nthe application of heat. And here we see the value of that beautiful\r\nlaw of the diffusion of gases, by which each gas, no matter what its\r\ndensity, is equally diffused in all directions through the other gases,\r\nindependent of temperature.\r\n\r\nI desire to call your attention this evening to one other distinct\r\nsystem of heating--I mean that very convenient, economical, cleanly and\r\nFASHIONABLE system of heating by direct radiation from steam-pipes.\r\n\r\nAs steam has become such a common article in all large buildings, both\r\nfor power and as a convenient means of distributing heat, most large\r\nbuildings are thus heated; and as a perfectly air-tight building can be\r\nvery easily heated thus, and as most persons are too ignorant or too\r\ncareless to provide a separate and distinct supply of fresh air simply\r\nfor ventilation alone, the consequence is, that this system, thus\r\nso shamefully abused, is probably drying up more talent and killing\r\nmore business men in our cities than any other system in existence.\r\nThis applies especially to the editorial rooms of nearly every one of our\r\nleading newspapers and publishing houses. They use steam for driving their\r\nbeautiful printing presses, and the heating and ventilation, or rather,\r\nthe entire want of ventilation, in their offices, would indicate that\r\nthey think that the same power that drives their presses, to do the\r\nprinting so nicely, is entirely sufficient to drive them to write the\r\noriginal articles for the printer, and that they have no more need of\r\n_fresh air_ than their presses.\r\n\r\nYou may think that I am certainly mistaken that so intelligent a class\r\nof the community, who are building such splendid fire-proof buildings,\r\nsuch perfect palaces of iron and stone and marble, as our newspaper\r\nestablishments are building in New York, Philadelphia and other large\r\ncities, would never make such a blunder as to omit providing the\r\nmost abundant supply of pure, fresh air to every employe in their\r\nestablishments, and at all times, both in summer and winter.\r\n\r\nShould there be any one present thus doubtful, I wish he would undertake\r\nto get any one of our enterprising newspaper establishments to publish\r\nin their paper an accurate intelligible account of their system of\r\nventilation, illustrating clearly the known quantity of pure, fresh air\r\ndelivered within using distance of each one of the editors and employes.\r\n\r\nI think he would soon come to the same conclusion I have, that the\r\nadvice of the minister to his congregation would be very applicable to\r\nthem--\"Always do as I _say_, but never do as I _do_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE III.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my first lecture, I endeavored to show how much we were suffering from\r\nthe effects of foul air, and the advantages to be gained by supplying\r\nourselves all the time with pure air. Because we must first feel that\r\nthere is something to be gained before we will make any great effort\r\ntowards obtaining a given result.\r\n\r\nIn my second lecture we considered the general principles governing the\r\ncirculation of air, the courses of its movements, the manner of the action\r\nof heat upon different kinds of substances, which creates a constant,\r\nceaseless motion of the air, in all places, from the minutest corked\r\nbottle to the vast currents that sweep over the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nNow, having learned the necessity for pure, fresh air, and studied the\r\ngeneral laws governing its circulation, let us apply these principles to\r\nevery-day life. To every-_day_ life? I should say every-_hour_ life--nay,\r\nevery _moment_ of our lives; for twenty times every minute of our entire\r\nlife, from the cradle to the grave, do we breathe what ought to be pure\r\nair. Is it always pure?\r\n\r\nIf we breathe one single breath, in the entire day, of _impure_ air, it\r\nwill weaken us, deduct from our capacity to attend to our daily duties,\r\nand shorten our lives, in exact mathematical proportion to the amount of\r\nimpurity in that one single breath. Now, we breathe twenty times every\r\nminute, twelve hundred times every hour, twenty-eight thousand times\r\nevery day, and nothing but absolute and perfectly pure air answers the\r\nexact requirements of perfect health.\r\n\r\nWell, you may ask, at first thought, if fresh air is such a panacea for\r\nall evils, and there is such an abundance of it out of doors, why not\r\nbreathe it, and always enjoy perfect health?\r\n\r\nThink one moment. I eat my breakfast in the morning, generally refreshed\r\nby a night of good sound sleep, (for I sleep with my windows open.)\r\nImmediately after breakfast, I enter the cars to come to the city. What\r\na smell comes from the car as the door is opened! and unless I wish\r\nto incur the displeasure, or provoke the indignation, of almost every\r\npassenger, by opening a window, I am obliged to sit in that foul,\r\noffensive atmosphere, and breathe the poisonous exhalations from my\r\nown lungs, and that from dozens of others, some of them, it may be,\r\nbadly diseased, (most persons' lungs _are diseased_ in this country,\r\nfrom breathing foul air, and many other diseases besides consumption\r\nare produced thereby.)\r\n\r\nThus, in one half hour, I have inhaled six hundred times of this foul\r\nand poisonous air, and the blood has carried it to every portion of my\r\nbody, so that my entire system is completely saturated, poisoned, yes,\r\nthoroughly poisoned by it, from the crown of my head to the soles of\r\nmy feet.\r\n\r\nAnd thus is the day commenced. Your blood is thoroughly poisoned before\r\nyour breakfast is digested; for your breakfast will no more digest\r\nwithout pure air than the coal in your stove will burn without it. You\r\nare subjected to headache, dyspepsia, and a half dozen other aches and\r\npains, and are tired out long before night. And thus you are killed long\r\nbefore you would die if you breathed pure air only.\r\n\r\nAnd am I relieved from the difficulty when I arrive in the city?\r\n\r\nStart to-morrow morning at the Delaware River, on Arch or Walnut\r\nStreets, or any other street, and go to the Schuylkill. Inquire of every\r\nindividual, in office, store, dwelling or factory, if he knows whether\r\nhe had pure air to breathe all day, or whether he can tell you, with\r\nany degree of accuracy, how pure the air was in the room he occupied\r\nfor any hour of that day.\r\n\r\nI fully believe there is not one in ten--no, not one in a hundred--of the\r\nmost intelligent men in that entire street, doctor, lawyer, architect,\r\nor any other, that can give you an accurate account of the condition of\r\nthe air breathed during any one hour of the day. That is not all. There\r\nis scarcely one in a hundred that can satisfy you, by an intelligent\r\ndescription, of the means used for providing it:\r\n\r\nFirst--Assuming the air outside to be pure, that there was a constant,\r\npositive and sufficient supply of that outside air introduced.\r\n\r\nSecondly--That that pure air was not deteriorated by overheating, or\r\ncontaminated by being mixed with the poisonous gases of the burning coal.\r\n\r\nThirdly--That there was sufficient moisture added to it to compensate\r\nfor its increased capacity for moisture, due to its expansion by the\r\nadditional heat given to it, (which is a very important thing.)\r\n\r\nFourthly--That there was any accurate, positive means provided for\r\ninsuring the fresh air to be brought within reach of the lungs of those\r\nfor whom it was intended.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly--That there was a positive means provided for the removal of\r\nall the poisoned air thrown from the lungs, so that none could possibly\r\nbe _re-breathed_.\r\n\r\nNo; you will find them in close, unventilated offices, in close factories,\r\nin almost _air-tight_ dwellings. In the large stores they do better.\r\n\r\nThe air is very commonly overheated, it is often mixed with impurities,\r\nand very seldom supplied with a proper amount of additional moisture.\r\n\r\nThe air is often so dry, that in a few minutes' conversation the linings\r\nof the air-passages to your lungs become parched and husky, producing\r\nirritation and a feverish condition of the system. And even in this room,\r\nto-night, do you see any opening at your feet, connected with a heated\r\nflue, for drawing the foul air from the floor as fast as thrown from your\r\nlungs? I believe there is not a square inch provided for that purpose.\r\n\r\nOr, do you see any escape immediately above the gas-lights, for carrying\r\noff the burned air while hot enough to escape? Not one. There are two\r\nor three openings, I think, in the back part of the room, just at the\r\nceiling, but for your breath to get there, it must rise and pass by\r\nthe zone of respiration, and much of it be again re-breathed; and the\r\nproducts of combustion, as we have seen, would cool sufficiently to fall\r\nto the floor long before they reached that point.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of calling your attention to this with more freedom,\r\nbecause it does not indicate any special inattention on the part of the\r\nManagers. It is not an exceptional case, but it is the rule. It is the\r\npopular opinion of the proper means of ventilation.\r\n\r\nGo with me, if you please, to that magnificent building, completed but\r\na few years since, at a cost of half a million of dollars, and given by\r\nits noble and generous founder to the city of New York. You will notice,\r\ninscribed above the entrance, cut in the solid stone, \"To the Arts and\r\nSciences.\" Look in this reading-room--perhaps the most useful and most\r\nappreciated of any public reading-room in the United States. See the large\r\nnumbers of honest, industrious mechanics, snatching an hour from their\r\nlabors, to look over the current literature of the day. Here, certainly,\r\nwe shall find the most perfect arrangement for heating and ventilation\r\nthat our knowledge of the arts and sciences could suggest. Let us see\r\nthe arrangements for bringing in the fresh air, for warming it in cold\r\nweather, and for removing the foul air.\r\n\r\nWhat! no provision for a regular supply of fresh air? Not one foot,\r\nnot one inch--neither are there any regular flues for the removal of the\r\nfoul air. And this most remarkable condition of things is but repeated\r\nin the magnificent hotels, marble palaces used as offices, and in many\r\nof the new and splendid colleges; and, we might almost say, in all other\r\nbuildings throughout the length and breadth of our land.\r\n\r\nThus you see how difficult it is for one to mingle freely in the society\r\nof his fellow-men, under existing circumstances, without being subjected\r\nto being poisoned by foul air. In going from here to my home, to-night,\r\nI shall have to ride in those cars, the air of which I dread more than\r\nI ever dreaded the small-pox or cholera. I have been in hospitals where\r\nI have seen much of both. They may slay their thousands, but foul air\r\nits tens of thousands. And it is only when I get to my room, where I\r\nshall probably sleep to-night with two windows well open, allowing the\r\nunobstructed breezes of half a mile of open country to sweep through\r\nmy chamber, that I shall feel entirely secure from the contaminating\r\ninfluences of foul air, and enjoy to its full extent the greatest of\r\nGod's temporal blessings to man--_pure air_.\r\n\r\nI have no new patent idea to present to you, which shall secure to you\r\nat all times perfectly pure air, without any further trouble on your\r\npart. There are no two constitutions precisely alike, any more than there\r\nare two human faces, or two handwritings, and there are no two hours in\r\nour entire life in which all the physical conditions of our body are\r\nprecisely the same. It would be just as absurd, therefore, to go to a\r\nventilating establishment, and tell the proprietor to ventilate your\r\nhouse or office, and pay the bill when it came in, and content yourself\r\nby saying: \"Well, I am glad this ventilating business is done with. I have\r\ngot my house ventilated, and the bills paid, and I am glad I am _through_\r\nwith that vexatious business.\" I say this would be just as absurd as it\r\nwould be, in case you had some pain or ache, to go to your doctor and\r\nget some medicine, and therewith content yourself, and say: \"Well, I am\r\nglad this doctoring business is over with; I have been dreading it all\r\nmy life. I have been to the doctor's at last, have been doctored, and got\r\nmy medicine and paid my bill, and so I am through with that vexatious\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\nNo--you must first feel that fresh air is worth taking some trouble\r\nto obtain. You must then make it a _study how_ to obtain it without\r\n_chilling_ or _overheating_ your body, in winter and in summer, at night\r\nand in the day time, when you are lying down and when you are sitting\r\nup, before eating and after eating, before exercising, while exercising,\r\nand after exercising--when you are well and when you are sick, when you\r\nare alone and when you are in the crowded cars, or in a crowded room, in\r\nwet weather and in dry, and for the ever varying changes of the external\r\natmosphere--all these conditions require separate and intelligent thought.\r\n\r\nIn summer we depend almost exclusively on the natural movements of\r\nthe air. To cause the air to _move_ is then the great matter. We must\r\nthen remember that the great masses of air move horizontally, not\r\nperpendicularly. Of course, there are many little disturbing influences,\r\nbut I mean the great mass of the air moves over the surface of the\r\nearth in horizontal strata. You can see this by the smoke of the\r\nlocomotive on the prairie, which can be seen sometimes for twenty or\r\nthirty miles, stretching along just above the horizon. All _flues_,\r\ntherefore, are of little account in summer. We must depend on open doors\r\nand windows. Suppose you wish to ventilate your room in the morning,\r\nthe air outside having become a little warmer than the air inside, and\r\nthe upper parts of the window only lowered: the warmer air would flow\r\nacross the top of the room, leaving the air undisturbed in the lower and\r\ncolder part. In this case, the window should be raised from the bottom,\r\nor a door opened that would afford an escape for the air.\r\n\r\nBut again, suppose this same room to want ventilating in the evening.\r\nThe room has become warm through the day, and the outside evening air\r\nis cooler than the room, and then, if you raise the windows from the\r\nbottom only, the cooler air will flow across the bottom of the room,\r\nleaving the upper part undisturbed and foul.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you have all noticed, frequently, that in going into a room in\r\nthe evening, when your heads were above the window opening, it would be\r\nquite hot, but if you stooped down below the line of the open window,\r\nit would be cool and pleasant. All windows should be made to lower from\r\nthe top, to meet this special case. If you are boarding, or are so\r\nunfortunate as to be put in a room where the great blunder has been made\r\nof not having the windows to lower, go to the nearest carpenter shop\r\nnext morning, before breakfast, and get a chisel, and cut six or eight\r\ninches off the little strip which supports the sash, and, with a gimlet,\r\nbore a hole directly through the sash, on both sides, and with a nail you\r\ncan keep the sash up in its place, when necessary. I have had hundreds,\r\nyes, I suppose, thousands, made to lower this way in the hospitals.\r\n\r\nMotion, motion is the great desideratum in summer. You have all noticed,\r\nno doubt, how pleasant it is to go into a cool room, like a parlor, that\r\nhas been kept shut up on a hot summer's day; but in a short time it begins\r\nto feel oppressive, and it is more comfortable to have the windows open,\r\nand a _circulation_ of air, even if it should be a little hotter than\r\nthe stagnant cool air.\r\n\r\nNever sleep with closed windows in summer. It is in winter, however,\r\nthat the greatest care is required in providing a constant supply of\r\npure air. If we would but accustom our minds to comprehend, readily and\r\nquickly, that cold air falls and warm air rises, it would assist us in\r\nour conclusions. We all know that, of course, but we do not practice\r\n_applying_ it readily and quickly on all occasions.\r\n\r\nIn summer, as I have said, the air moves horizontally, and then windows\r\nand doors are the great means of ventilation; but as cold weather\r\napproaches, we must keep the windows shut, excepting when in bed. In\r\nwinter, therefore, we must resort to flues for the means of creating a\r\ncirculation, and for conveying the air from one part to another. A flue\r\nis simply a passage--a communication--for air of different temperatures.\r\nA flue has no power to _create_ a draught. If the air within is colder,\r\nit will have the power to fall; if warmer, it will be driven up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nFor illustrating this, I have here some glass tubes about two feet long\r\nand two inches diameter. This one (Fig. 8) has been lying on the table\r\nsome time, and I suppose is very nearly the temperature of the air in\r\nthe room. I have here a little tin box, which answers for a connecting\r\ntube, and over one of the openings I stand this tube, and by the smoke\r\nfrom this taper, first held at the top, you see there is no current\r\ndown the tube. And again, by holding the taper at the lower opening,\r\nyou see there is no current passing up the flue. But I will remove that,\r\nand place one (Fig. 9) over the same opening that is warmer, and now you\r\ncan see how strongly the smoke is drawn down through this lower opening,\r\nand see it flowing up this warm flue, and out at the top.\r\n\r\nWe will now substitute a cold flue (Fig. 10). This condenses the air,\r\nand it falls rapidly. This action often occurs in the spring and early\r\npart of summer, especially in the morning, as the external air becomes\r\nheated, and the solid mason-work of the chimney remains cold, causing\r\na descending current, which is often noticeable by the smell of soot\r\nin the room. We will now add this tube, of the same temperature as the\r\nroom (Fig. 11), to see if the additional height will not make an ascending\r\ncurrent. But you see the smoke is still drawn down, the height of the\r\nflue adds a little to its power, but the difference in its temperature\r\nis the controlling force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nWe will now place another tube over the lower opening (Fig. 12). Just see\r\nwhat a wonderful effect that has! Here is the air rushing down this short\r\nflue and up the two cold ones. We called those two first pipes cold, but\r\nour ideas of heat and cold are simply _comparative_; everything is warm,\r\nor has heat in it. Perhaps some of us think there is not much heat in\r\nthe air when it comes whistling around our ears 15 deg. or 20 deg. below zero;\r\nbut the cold rigid chemist will still extract many degrees of heat from\r\nthat.  We must, therefore, remember that absolute temperature has nothing\r\nto do with the air passing up or down a flue--it is simply _comparative_\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nLet me show you one more experiment. Here are two tubes we have had\r\nheated; as you see, the smoke rushes up them rapidly. But now we will\r\nadd this third one (Fig. 13), which reverses the current at once. The\r\ntwo first are hot, taking the _temperature of the room as the standard_,\r\nbut the third one is still _hotter_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nThe form of a flue has but little to do with the draught; the height has\r\na slight influence, but bear in mind constantly that the great moving\r\npower in all flues is the variation of temperature.\r\n\r\nNow, let us make a practical application of this principle.\r\n\r\nWait a moment: just let us lay this one aside, but not forget it, as we\r\nshall want to refer to it in a few moments, and try another experiment\r\nwhich has some bearing upon the subject.\r\n\r\nI have here a tube just one foot square and two feet long, and one foot\r\nfrom the bottom there is what we will suppose to be an air-tight piston\r\nthat can be moved without friction. Now, suppose we heat that air 490 deg.\r\n(for the sake of easy remembering, say 500 deg.); this would just double\r\nits volume--it would then be two cubic feet in size instead of one.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that, instead of letting this air expand, we should put a\r\nweight on it, so as to keep it in its place, how much do you think we\r\nshould have to place on? Two thousand one hundred and sixty pounds, or\r\nabout one ton. Now, what do we find these 2160 pounds to represent? It\r\nis the weight of a column of atmosphere with a base of one foot square,\r\nor fifteen pounds multiplied by 144 square inches--it is the weight that\r\nwould rest upon the piston if all the air was taken out from under it.\r\nTherefore, if you add about 500 deg. of heat to a cubic foot of air, it makes\r\nit two cubic feet of air; or, if you attempt to keep it from expanding,\r\nyou must put a ton weight upon it.\r\n\r\nMark one thing, however, if it takes ten ounces of coal to heat that air\r\nto 490 deg., which we do by piling our ton weight upon it, it will take\r\nfourteen ounces of coal if we allow it to expand to two feet.\r\n\r\nIn the former case, where the air remains stationary, it had done no\r\nwork. It was ready to go to work, but it had not commenced. But in the\r\ncase of its expansion, it had done a great work. What was it? Why it had\r\nlifted that ton of atmospheric air one foot in height, and that work was\r\nwhat used up the difference between ten parts and fourteen parts of coal\r\n(I don't trouble you with fractions).\r\n\r\nYou see, therefore, to make the air quit the earth and ascend into the\r\nupper regions, requires a positive power, the same as it does to drive\r\nsome poor simple people away from the fire on a cold day.\r\n\r\nWe often say that, by heating air, we give it power to ascend; instead\r\nof which heating it destroys its power to maintain its position. It\r\nweakens--enervates it--so that its neighbors easily drive it out and\r\ntake its place.\r\n\r\nOne cubic foot of air, diluted to two feet, would be driven about two\r\nmiles and a half high before it found any body as weak as itself, for\r\nevery 350 feet in height, in round numbers, the pressure diminishes by\r\nan amount equal to one degree, or forced under water thirty-four feet\r\nreduces it to one-half its bulk.\r\n\r\nNow, let us go back and finish our syphon, or flue experiment.\r\n\r\nHere we have our little glass house again. We will take the roof off\r\nand put a pretty large family in it--I mean large in numbers, if not\r\nin size. You may call it a school, or public meeting, or church, or\r\nwhatever you please. Suppose, for illustration, we call it a church,\r\nand we will call this larger light in this end the minister speaking\r\nto the congregation. You see, the lights are a good deal agitated,\r\nand flare around a good deal.\r\n\r\nThere is a rush of air down at this end, and, as it becomes heated,\r\nit rises at the other. Let us cover about one-half of this up. Now see\r\nwhat a rush of air there is _down_ these flues, instead of _up_ them,\r\nas there ought to be. Here, you see, the main body of the building,\r\nthough much shorter than the flues, forms the heated leg of the syphon;\r\nand you may thus recognize why many of the ventilating flues, put in the\r\ncold outside walls of many of our large buildings, persist in working\r\nthe wrong way, and cold air blows down there, instead of the foul air\r\ngoing up.\r\n\r\nBut there seems to be too much draught. Let us put the roof on. Ah, that\r\nis better; but, then, what a draught there is down this chimney-flue.\r\nCall the sexton, and have that stopped up quickly, or those sitting near\r\nthere will soon catch their death of cold, and will never come here again.\r\n\r\nYou see, however, they shine very brightly, notwithstanding all the\r\ndraught, but there, now, it is all closed up as snugly as the most\r\nfashionable church in town. See how quiet and peacefully they burn now.\r\n\r\nAh, there is one just gone to sleep. You must excuse him, he probably\r\nwas up most of the night with a sick child. And there goes another.\r\nI think he must have been very busy for the last week settling up his\r\nlast year's accounts. Just see, they are going to sleep so fast, I don't\r\nthink we can pretend to give excuses for them all.\r\n\r\nAnd, now, is not that a brilliant congregation to be preaching to?\r\nEveryone dead asleep excepting the preacher himself, and I suspect he\r\nfeels stupid enough to go to sleep, but it would not look well; and he\r\nhas to tax his energies so severely he will hardly get over it, so as\r\nto be good for anything for the balance of the week.\r\n\r\nYou may think this an exaggerated representation of the real facts. Do\r\nnot deceive yourselves. A few months since I was requested by one of\r\nthe congregation to visit a building within a few minutes' walk of this\r\nplace, and see if there was not some defect in the ventilation. The\r\ngentleman stated to me that he sometimes attended the class-meeting,\r\nand would be glad to go oftener, but it was held in the basement story,\r\nand it was quite impossible for him to keep awake, as he had to get up\r\nand go out two or three times during the evening, to get a little fresh\r\nair, or he could not keep awake.\r\n\r\nI examined it. The ceilings were low-only nine or ten feet;--then there\r\nwere two old leaky portable furnaces, which were used as occasion\r\nrequired for heating the large room above, or the basement room when\r\nthe class-meeting was held.\r\n\r\nThe only ventilation they had was to let off the surplus heat (if they\r\nhad any, which was seldom) into the room above.\r\n\r\nNow for fresh air. By a very careful and minute examination, I discovered\r\na little pipe (I think it was about six inches in diameter) to each\r\nstove (both of which would not be over half as large as what I have to\r\nsupply my own bedroom), for the supply of the fresh air for that whole\r\ncongregation. _Fresh air_, did I say? Well, let us see where this\r\nfresh air comes from. The janitor, after taking us down and showing\r\nwhere he kept the ashes, wood, old benches, and all sorts of rubbish,\r\nwas about going up, but said I, \"Where is the part where you get the\r\nfresh air to the furnaces?\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"he could not get to that,\r\nit was such a rough place, and there was a sewer or gutter (from the\r\nadjoining graveyard I suppose) running right across it.\" And from that\r\nplace, too rough to be got at, with an open sewer running through,\r\nand too foul to go into, was where they got the _fresh air_ (!) from\r\nfor the whole of that congregation to breathe.\r\n\r\nAnd do you suppose this is an exception? Let me tell you. During the\r\nfirst year of the late war I was called upon by the Sanitary Commission\r\nto examine the hospitals in Washington City with reference to their\r\nventilation. A large number of the churches in that city were used for\r\nhospital purposes, and many of them were heated by hot-air furnaces,\r\nand in not _one single instance_ had they fresh air boxes to them,\r\nneither had they any means for carrying off the foul air. The furnaces\r\nwere generally placed in a hole excavated under the main part of the\r\nbuilding, and all the ground around them left exposed, and the air\r\nwas sucked in from the fermenting, decaying vegetable mould under the\r\nbuilding. And this place around the furnace was the place where all\r\nthe filth and old rubbish was thrown to get it _out of the way_, and\r\nit was thoroughly out of the way too, for the surgeon in charge or any\r\ninspector never got there to see it. In some cases I found this space\r\naround the furnace used as the dead house!\r\n\r\nDid I say there was no attempt in any of those buildings for systematic\r\nventilation? I ought to have made one exception.\r\n\r\nI called one morning about ten o'clock at one of the finest new churches,\r\nwhich was then being occupied as a hospital, and asked for the surgeon in\r\ncharge. He had not arrived. (They did not often venture in before eleven\r\no'clock, the wards became so foul during the night it took till that time,\r\nwith the windows up, to get them fit for the surgeon in charge to venture\r\nin.) I inquired of the wardmaster how the building was ventilated. \"Oh,\r\nvery well--very well, indeed--they had good ventilation,\" pointing up to\r\na large, splendid ventilator in the ceiling. \"Do you keep that always\r\nopen?\" I asked. \"Oh, certainly,\" he replied. But I always have a great\r\nsuspicion of those ceiling ventilators, as they are generally shut. So\r\nI walked around the ward, and when under it asked him again if he thought\r\nthat was open. A smile came over his face as he discovered, for the first\r\ntime, it was a handsome fresco painting on the solid wall. And this was\r\nthe only practical systematic attempt at any ventilation in any of the\r\nchurch buildings used as hospitals in all Washington.\r\n\r\nI have not been in any of the public schools in this city for many years,\r\nbut a gentleman told me the other day that he called at one of the\r\nfashionable schools up town to get his son and take him home under his\r\numbrella, as it had commenced raining since morning, and as he opened\r\nthe school room door he was perfectly shocked, as he staggered back from\r\nthe gust of horrible foul air that came rushing out of that room.\r\n\r\nI have examined most of the public schools in New York since I have those\r\nof Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThey have a way of their own of doing public business over there. There\r\nhas been a good deal said about ventilating public schools of late years,\r\nand as it was such a scientific and fashionable matter they must have\r\ntheir schools ventilated of course.\r\n\r\nI was very unfortunate in my intercourse with the Directors of the Public\r\nSchools. I did not happen to meet with many of those high toned, liberal,\r\nscientific gentlemen that are on many of the committees, of course.\r\n\r\nThose beautiful and ornamental gratings called registers are accepted as\r\nthe external proof of good ventilation, suggesting as they do the flow\r\nof an abundance of pure fresh air. So registers were bought freely and\r\nput in all the rooms, top and bottom, with splendid red and green and\r\nblue tassels, altogether making a handsome show and doing the very able\r\nand scientific gentlemen on the School Boards great credit for their\r\nenterprise and great care for the welfare and interest of the pupils\r\nunder their charge.\r\n\r\nNow, let us examine the operation of these registers. Holding a\r\nhandkerchief in front of them, there it remained perfectly motionless.\r\nIt neither blew hot nor cold--it was perfectly lukewarm, motionless. Go\r\nto another--the same. And to another--the same. Well that is singular.\r\nLet us go on the roof and see what can be the matter. A careful search\r\nfails to discover any flues at all, but a mechanical examination shows\r\nthat the coping-stone has been put on them, making all the flues as\r\nthoroughly air-tight as the solid wall--more perfectly capped than that\r\nchimney. There had been no attention paid to having the holes for the\r\nventilating flues cut through the coping-stone.\r\n\r\nYes, I believe that to-day a large proportion of all those flues with\r\nthe elegant ventilating registers at the top and bottom of the room,\r\nare capped and made as thoroughly air-tight as the solid wall, and are\r\nas perfect shams and as useless as the elegant frescoed ventilator on\r\nthe solid wall of the church hospital in Washington.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that Philadelphians have gone quite thus far in\r\nsatisfying the public demand for ventilation in the public schools. They\r\nmay not have _done any more_, but I believe they have not _pretended_\r\nto do quite as much.\r\n\r\nExcuse me a few minutes; I must illustrate another very great deficiency.\r\nThe simple illustration I will give you represents almost the universal\r\ncondition of our hot-air furnaces.\r\n\r\nMuch complaint was made of the uncomfortable feeling in one of the large\r\npublic schools, where they had some 1200 or 1500 scholars. I was called\r\nto examine it. I asked, as is my usual habit, if they evaporated plenty\r\nof water. \"Oh, yes; they had given the janitor full directions about\r\nkeeping the evaporating pans always full.\" I found the evaporating pans\r\nfull, sure enough, rather to my surprise, but what do you think they were\r\nfilled with? Several old brooms, half charred, and some old water buckets\r\nall fallen to pieces, and other rubbish thrown in there _out of the way_.\r\n\r\nAnd now those of you who have been trusting to your servants to keep\r\nwater in your furnaces, if you will take a candle when you go home and go\r\ndown and examine your own furnaces, you will most likely find them dry,\r\nand if you go to the public schools in the morning you will see that\r\nthey too are not an exception.\r\n\r\nI wish I had time to explain the dreadful effect of this want of moisture\r\nin all our artificially heated rooms. The air in winter is very dry, the\r\nmoisture is squeezed out as the water is squeezed out of this sponge. But\r\nas you heat it you enlarge its volume again, and it sucks up the moisture\r\njust as this sponge does, and if you do not supply this moisture in other\r\nways it will suck the natural moisture from your skin and your lungs,\r\ncreating that dry, parched, feverish condition so noticeable in our\r\nfurnace and other stove-heated rooms. Few persons realize the great\r\namount of water necessary to be evaporated to produce the natural\r\ncondition of moisture corresponding with the increased temperature\r\ngiven the air in many of our rooms in winter.\r\n\r\nI have copied a table expressing in grains troy the moisture contained\r\nin one cubic foot of air when saturated:\r\n\r\n        Degrees     Grains of vapor\r\n      Fahrenheit.   in cubic foot.\r\n\r\n           10             0.8\r\n           20             1.3\r\n           30             2.0\r\n           40             2.9\r\n           50             4.0\r\n           60             6.0\r\n           70             8.0\r\n           80            10.0\r\n           90            15.0\r\n          100            19.0\r\n\r\nThus you see, taking the air at 10 deg. and heating up to 70 deg., the ordinary\r\ntemperature of our rooms, requires about nine times the moisture contained\r\nin the original external atmosphere, and if heated to 100 deg., as most of\r\nour hot-air furnaces heat the air, it would require about twenty-three\r\ntimes the amount in the external atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting and important subject, but I am sorry I have\r\nnot time for further explanation.\r\n\r\nI see some kind friend has been around and opened the doors of our\r\nmeeting-house and awakened the sleepers. And now you see the lights shine,\r\nand the cheeks glow as brightly as would those of our young ladies could\r\nthey be persuaded to go skating, or take a five mile walk every day,\r\nrain or shine, and sleep with the windows open, and never ride in any\r\nof our cars, or go to parties or any other public gatherings unless the\r\nbuildings where they are held are well ventilated.\r\n\r\nBut those dreadful drafts! People will not bear them. Let us see if\r\nwe can accommodate them. Put on the roof, and here comes this dreadful\r\ncurrent again down the ventilating flue. Well, ventilating flues have the\r\nname of being great humbugs. Let us shut them up. There are your poor\r\nconsumptive patients--there they go, you see. One-half dead already,\r\nand the rest will soon follow if we cannot rescue them. Let us open the\r\nflue again. See how they brighten up as the fresh air comes in. There\r\nis no use of disputing about it, you must have _a current of fresh air\r\ncoming into the house_ or you will surely die.\r\n\r\nNow let us change the programme. Let us build a fire in this fire-place\r\nin the lower story--that burns up brightly. Where does it get fresh air\r\nfrom now? There can be no current down the chimney. Let us search it out\r\nwith this smoking taper. Ah, here it is coming down through the ventilator\r\nfrom the very top of the house. We will soon stop that by this cap. But\r\nsee, it still burns as brightly as ever. Let us try again. Ah, do you\r\nsee the smoke rushing down the second story chimney and across to the\r\nstairway, and down the stairs, and across the room again to this fire?\r\n\r\n_There is a valuable hint._ Have you not noticed frequently gas in the\r\nroom from the fire-place or stove, and especially at night? And do you see\r\nhow easily it would be to account for it if the house were shut up tight\r\nat night, with a large fire in the kitchen or furnace in the cellar,\r\nand but a small fire in the second story? Don't you see how the whole\r\nproducts of combustion, all the poisonous gases, may be drawn out into\r\nthe room? You often notice accounts of whole families being smothered to\r\ndeath in one night, but many seem to think if they are not smothered to\r\ndeath the first night, that it is not so very dangerous after all, and\r\nnot knowing how to remedy it easily go on from day to day and sometimes\r\nescape the whole winter with a little of their lives left.\r\n\r\nNow, let us put out the fire in the first story and make one in the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nYou must remember that this is not a fashionable double ceiled and\r\nplastered air-tight house. It is much more open, in proportion to its\r\nsize, than any ordinary house. And now, as this lower flue has been so\r\nhighly heated, it may take some time for the fire in the second story\r\nfire-place to become heated sufficiently in excess to cause the air to\r\ndraw down the longest flue to the bottom of the house and up the stairs\r\nto the second story fire-place, but it will soon do it.\r\n\r\nI wish you to notice one thing here particularly, and each one apply\r\nit to your own particular case. You know the lower part of the house is\r\nclosed up tight to keep out the robbers, and if great care is not taken\r\nto give an abundant supply of fresh air to your chambers otherwise,\r\nit will be drawn up through the hall out of your kitchen and cellar,\r\nand as the cook has left the range lid off and shut the dampers, you\r\nwill have a suffocating smell of gas all over the house. But the worst\r\ndanger of all is the air that may be drawn in from an untrapped sewer\r\nor cesspool. This is a very common but great source of ill-health.\r\n\r\nSanitarians have given much attention to this subject lately, and have\r\nbeen astonished at the magnitude of the evil. I have long maintained\r\nthat a family might go to the highest and most healthy location in the\r\nworld, and by a little carelessness might accumulate sufficient filth\r\naround them, and by closing up the house at night and allowing the foul\r\ngases from untrapped sewers and cesspools to enter through the halls\r\nto their sleeping rooms, to thus make what would otherwise be a healthy\r\nplace a very unhealthy one.\r\n\r\nAs a case in point, I would refer to a very interesting report of Doctors\r\nPalmer, Ford, and Earle, giving an account of their investigations of the\r\ncauses of a severe epidemic that occurred in the summer of 1864 in a young\r\nladies' seminary in Massachusetts. \"The Maplewood Institute\" is situated\r\nin Pittsfield, one of the most beautiful of those charming New England\r\nvillages, which, to external appearances, are the very emblem of all that\r\nis pure and healthy. Yet even in this lovely place, from an ignorant or\r\ncareless arrangement of the drains and cess-pools, much of the foul gas\r\ngenerated there found its way into the building,[2] making sixty-six out\r\nof seventy-four young ladies sick, fifty-seven of whom had the typhoid\r\nfever and thirteen died. Many similar cases are frequently occurring,\r\nsome few of which, like this, are carefully investigated, and the causes\r\nremoved. Many more, however, go unnoticed, and are accepted as special\r\ndispensations of Providence, when it is all due to our own negligence.\r\n\r\nI want to show you an arrangement that ought to be in every house. We\r\nhave seen the power of a fire to create a draft, and if you will think\r\na little you will notice that the kitchen fire is the most considerable\r\nand most permanent power in ordinary dwellings, and this ought to be\r\nmade use of to ventilate the kitchen, water-closet and bath-room in\r\nevery house. But you must not make an opening directly into the kitchen\r\nflue; if you do you will interfere with the draft of the kitchen fire,\r\nand if you interfere with the kitchen fire you will soon wish yourself\r\nat anything but keeping house.\r\n\r\nBut we can easily get over that trouble. We will use this square glass box\r\nagain to represent a flue. I don't mean this to represent the size--it\r\nought to be twice that size. In the centre we will put a cold pipe, to\r\nshow you that a pipe without any heat in it would only cause the foul\r\nair to tumble down into the room. Thus you see the smoke descending. We\r\nwill substitute a pipe with a gas light to heat it. Now you see what\r\na rapid current there is out of this large flue. See what a splendid\r\narrangement this is for ventilating, and it may be extended so as to\r\nventilate the whole house. It is not necessary that the room to be\r\nventilated should be adjoining, but a pipe can be carried between the\r\nfloors 50 or 100 feet.\r\n\r\nI had an opportunity, during the late war, of thoroughly testing this\r\nsystem of ventilation in the government hospitals.\r\n\r\nLet me say here that a very common mistake in making ventilating flues\r\nis, that they are entirely too small to be of any value. One of these\r\nlittle Philadelphia flues, four by nine inches, made with rough bricks,\r\nand nearly or entirely choked up with mortar, as many of them are\r\nfrequently found, is of no account. They are simply a deception, and\r\na perfect provocation to a sensible man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nI commenced by making some in Washington, for single wards, thirty\r\ninches square, but in St. Louis, and Louisville, and Nashville, where\r\nbuildings four or five stories high were used for hospitals, I made them\r\nmuch larger, some three feet square and some four feet by six feet. Some\r\nbuildings, where the ventilation was so bad and the water-closets were\r\nso offensive that the government had to abandon them, I had ventilated\r\nby these immense shafts, heated by the kitchen and laundry fires, which\r\nproved thoroughly efficient and entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to have time to discuss the subject of heating more fully\r\nin connection with ventilation, but cannot; but I will state, in the\r\nsimplest manner, a few of the leading points first.\r\n\r\n_You must have fresh air all the time._ In summer you can get it by\r\nopening the doors and windows. In winter it must be warmed before\r\nentering the room. It must not enter the room cold and flow across\r\nthe floor to the other side before it reaches the heating apparatus.\r\nYou can bear a large amount of fresh air if it strikes you in the face\r\nand evenly over the whole body, but never let a jet of cold air blow\r\nupon any small portion of your body.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these local currents sucking in at cracks, you must make\r\nprovision for the introduction of an amount of air _larger_ than the sum\r\nof all these cracks, and your exhaust flue besides. This air must be\r\npartially warmed before entering. If this is done by a hot-air furnace,\r\nit must have a large fresh air box, which should be from eighteen inches\r\nto two feet for a large house. It should have a large evaporating vessel,\r\nwith a ball-cock to supply it. You cannot get the servants to attend\r\nto it, and you must never allow the air from your cellar to enter your\r\nfurnace to be driven up stairs. Never allow the furnace to get red-hot.\r\n\r\nA hot water furnace disturbs the natural conditions of the air the least,\r\nand, on that account, is a very healthy means of artificially heating\r\nair. But they are necessarily expensive, and so few persons really\r\nappreciate the value of pure air, that but few will go to the expense\r\nof introducing them. It is a mistake to suppose that they do not dry the\r\nair, so to speak. You cannot elevate the temperature without increasing\r\nthe capacity for moisture. A hot water furnace, therefore, requires\r\nthe artificial evaporation of water to give the warmed air its true\r\nhygrometric condition.\r\n\r\nHeating the air by steam is the next most healthy means; as the surfaces\r\nused are heated a little hotter, less of it answers the same purpose. The\r\nfirst cost is therefore less. It is the most rapid and convenient means\r\nof conveying heat to any distant point of anything now in use. Under\r\nthe pressure of an ordinary boiler it will travel seven miles in one\r\nminute. The time I hope is not far distant when the subject of heating and\r\nventilation will receive an amount of attention due to its importance.\r\nI believe then we shall have steam pipes laid through our streets, the\r\nsame as gas and water now are. The present system of each man keeping\r\nup separate fires all over his house is as crude, and extravagant, and\r\nunnecessary as it would be for every man to make his own gas or have\r\nhis own well for water.\r\n\r\nWhere a steam furnace is used, two-thirds of the heating surface should\r\nbe put below the floor and fresh air brought into it, and from there\r\nconducted to the rooms through large pipes. This warmed air should be\r\nlet into the room at the floor, and an opening into an exhaust flue,\r\ntwo-thirds the size of the inlet, should be provided at the floor for the\r\nescape of the foul air. The remaining one-third of the heating surface\r\nshould be exposed in the halls and some in the other parts of the house,\r\nto heat by direct radiation, but under no circumstances should a room or\r\noffice be occupied _heated exclusively by direct radiation_ from exposed\r\nsteam pipes. It is one of the worst, most unhealthy, _killing systems_\r\nin existence.\r\n\r\nSteam furnaces require the evaporation of an additional amount of moisture\r\nas well as any other system of heating. According to Dr. Wetheral's\r\ninvestigation, it would require the evaporation on some days of nearly\r\nforty pounds of water every minute in the Senate Chamber to maintain the\r\nproper hygrometric condition. Probably one of the very best arrangements\r\nis to have a good steam furnace, with a large fresh air box letting\r\nin an abundance of air moderately warmed, and overflowing the house\r\nwith this, and some direct radiation in the halls, and a good, bright,\r\ncheerful open fire in the family sitting-room.\r\n\r\nBut if you cannot have a steam or hot water furnace, you can make a\r\nroom very comfortable indeed with a stove, if you will but introduce\r\nall the fresh air required for the room directly against or on top of\r\nthe stove. No stove ought to be put up without having a supply of fresh\r\nair from the outside, and a large evaporating vessel, kept constantly\r\nfilled with water, with an opening in the heated flue near the floor\r\nfor the escape of the foul air.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to urge upon you to examine your furnace\r\nthis evening or to-morrow morning, and if there is no fresh air box\r\ncommunicating with the external atmosphere, go to the nearest carpenter's\r\nshop before going to your business, and get him to come at the earliest\r\npossible moment and put in a good large one, and if he asks you where\r\nyou want the damper in the cold air box, tell him you don't want any.\r\n\r\nDampers in cold air boxes are handy things to have in the house, when\r\nused properly, but, like fire-arms, are very dangerous if you do not\r\nunderstand them. Yes, dampers in cold air boxes and other contrivances\r\nfor keeping the fresh air out of houses, have killed more persons than\r\nall the fire-arms ever made in this country or any other.\r\n\r\nIf you have no evaporating vessel in the furnace, stop at your furnace\r\nman's, and tell him to put in two good large evaporating vessels in such\r\na position that they will evaporate two or three buckets of water a day\r\nin cold weather.\r\n\r\nAnd if you have a stove at your office, stop on your way down and buy\r\na good large earthen pan to set on the top of the stove, and keep it\r\nalways full of water. Make a pipe for the inlet of fresh air to every\r\nstove over which you have any control, and never remain in a room one\r\nday without a good opening at the floor for the escape of foul air.\r\n\r\nAnd from my own experience, and that of many others whom I know to\r\nhave given much attention to this subject, I can assure you, with the\r\nfullest confidence, that you will be most amply rewarded for your care\r\nin this respect by increased health, strength and happiness, and by the\r\nreasonable prospect of a long life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVENTILATION.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND PRIZE AWARDED AT THE PARIS EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded to the many other gratifying signs of a rapidly increasing interest\r\nin the all-important subject of the proper supply of pure air to our\r\nhouses, is the awarding of the grand prize of the Paris Exhibition to\r\nDr. Evans, for an American sanitary collection.\r\n\r\nThe Sanitary Commission, during our late war, acted upon the principle\r\nsince expressed by the report of the Board of Health of New York. They\r\nsay: \"And viewing only the causes of preventable diseases and their\r\nfatal results, we unhesitatingly state that the very first sanitary want\r\nin New York and Brooklyn is VENTILATION--ventilation supplied in all\r\nexisting tenant-houses, work-rooms, school-rooms and places of\r\nassemblage--and in all that shall hereafter be constructed.\"\r\n\r\nThe early recognition during the late war, both by the Sanitary Commission\r\nand the government officials, of the important fact that many more men are\r\nkilled by breathing foul air than are killed by the enemies' bullets, led\r\nthem to use very active exertions to secure good ventilation in hospitals\r\nand camps, and to teach the men themselves the value thereof. The result\r\nhas been highly satisfactory. The fact that we must make some positive\r\nprovision for a constant supply of fresh air to every occupied room,\r\nand not rely on accidental cracks and openings, is now very generally\r\nfelt. The simple, practical and efficient means used by the government\r\nhas done much towards creating this wholesome public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe annexed plan (excepting a stove and twelve beds, omitted from\r\ncentre of plan, indicated by the space) is a copy of one I furnished\r\nthe Committee; and which was faithfully executed in preparing one of\r\nthe models of hospitals, the arrangements of which have been so highly\r\nappreciated, and has shared one of the grand prizes at the Paris\r\nExhibition.\r\n\r\nIt is a representative plan, showing the general arrangements of wards\r\nin a large number of the hospitals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe special arrangements of flues, V, for winter ventilation, and the\r\nintroduction of the fresh air around the stove, were not introduced into\r\nthe hospitals in Philadelphia, built at the commencement of the war. And\r\nthe subsequent orders of the Surgeon General and Quarter Master General\r\nfor the introduction thereof were protested against by the Surgeons of\r\nPhiladelphia, owing probably partially to their proverbial objection to\r\nchanges of any kind, and partially to that dread of \"ventilation\" made\r\nbut too popular by the many erroneous theories which propose to introduce\r\nthe fresh air directly into the room, and at times, too, when it is even\r\nbelow the freezing point, without first warming it. These arrangements,\r\nshown in the accompanying plan and section, were thoroughly tested,\r\nhowever, in many of the hospitals subsequently built in many of the\r\nWestern cities.\r\n\r\nThe plan of ridge ventilation, shown in the accompanying section, I\r\napplied first in St. Louis, in the summer of 1863. It is the principle\r\nof the Emerson ventilator applied to ridge ventilation. Much trouble\r\nhad been experienced with other forms on account of their allowing the\r\nstorms to beat in, and the difficulty of opening and closing them with\r\nthe various changes of wind; this form fully remedies those objections,\r\nand can be left open without inconvenience at all times while snowing\r\nor raining. It uses the force of the wind, whenever there is a current\r\npassing over the top of the building, for sucking the air out of the ward,\r\nbecause the air in passing across the top of the building is deflected\r\nfrom the straight line by the angle of the roof-board, which creates a\r\npartial vacuum in the space below, which, with the friction of the passing\r\ncurrent with that coming out of the ward, makes an outward draught,\r\nvarying in proportion to the velocity of the external current. This is\r\noften very useful, especially in summer, when there is not sufficient\r\ndifference between the external air and that in the ward to create a\r\ncurrent. There is often a considerable force in the passing current at\r\nthe top of the building when there is much less below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nBut of course these openings had to be closed in winter to prevent all\r\nthe heat from escaping. It then became necessary in wards that had no\r\nfireplaces, to make something as substitutes therefor. Wooden shafts or\r\nflues were made to answer this purpose.\r\n\r\nI at first made large wooden boxes, placing them in the centre of the\r\nwards, and allowing them to extend down to within twelve or eighteen\r\ninches of the floor. This was of great advantage, but as the true principle\r\nof ventilation is to have an opening for the exit of the contaminated\r\nair at the feet of each occupant of a room, or at the head of the bed\r\nof each patient in a hospital, it was soon observed that these shafts\r\nwere too few and far between to make a very perfect arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for providing for the escape of the foul air from the\r\nlevel of the floor in winter, so as to utilize the heat, was, after\r\nmuch opposition, finally established and officially acknowledged by the\r\ngovernment officers. Then arrangements were made for its introduction\r\ninto the government hospitals in a more perfect manner.\r\n\r\nI believe in no case, however, was it so fully carried out as to place\r\na ventilating flue between each bed, but in some they were arranged, as\r\nshown (marked V) in the accompanying plans between every other two beds.\r\n\r\nThese flues were carried together and extended through the ridge of the\r\nroof and capped as an Emerson ventilator; the opening into the large\r\nflue, extending to just below the ceiling, was closed in winter at all\r\ntimes, excepting when the room was too warm. This was for the exhaust,\r\nbut of no less importance was the supply.\r\n\r\nThe popular dread of ventilation arises in a great measure from the\r\nsupposition that good ventilation implies a strong draught of cold air\r\nupon your back or feet or some other unfortunately exposed place. Such an\r\nunfortunate occurrence must be fully remedied in any system of ventilation\r\nbefore it can become popular.\r\n\r\nAs the simplest way of getting at this, all the fresh air required to\r\nsupply the partial vacuum created by the exhausting shafts was brought in\r\naround the stoves, and partially warmed before entering. At the first the\r\nstoves were entirely encased, and the fresh air allowed to encircle them\r\ncompletely, but experience soon demonstrated the desirableness of having a\r\nportion of the hot stove exposed for direct radiation, so that the feeble\r\nand chilly ones might come near to it and warm themselves. There should\r\nalways be a considerable amount of direct radiation in every hospital;\r\nthat from an open fire is the best, but that from a stove or steam-pipe\r\nis very good.\r\n\r\nArrangements were also made for the evaporation of a large amount of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAs the first winter approached after the commencement of the war, the\r\nidea seemed almost shocking to me of putting the sick and wounded men\r\nin such open barracks, generally without plastering, and made, as many\r\nof them were, with rough boards and very open.\r\n\r\nBut experience soon taught me the very great superiority of these light\r\nand airy buildings over many of the elaborately finished, dark, air-tight\r\nstructures, such as hotels, colleges, new-fashioned asylums, &c., which\r\nthe government was compelled to take for hospital purposes.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when completed with the ventilation as above described, with the\r\nabundant sunlight on both sides, without any obstructing partitions and\r\nabundantly warmed in winter, and with the proper supply of moisture, they\r\nmade undoubtedly the most comfortable and wholesome class of buildings,\r\nas a whole, that have ever been erected for hospital purposes, not\r\nexcepting even many of the recent elaborately finished buildings, where\r\nnot unfrequently too much dependence has been placed on the very meagre\r\nand insufficient effect produced by attempts at artificial ventilation,\r\ninstead of relying more upon the great natural means of ventilation--an\r\nabundance of large open windows, open fires and good ventilating stoves.\r\n\r\nThe ventilation of the latrines or water-closets of a hospital, as well\r\nas any other place, is a matter of great importance.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1863, I had put up in a hospital in Washington a\r\nventilating shaft for the latrine room, similar to the one shown on the\r\nplans. This was an experiment, but it proved so satisfactory that it\r\nwas subsequently ordered to be applied in all the principal hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in the isolated wards was, that it required a separate\r\nfire in each shaft in the summer. Where it is possible to get it near\r\nthe kitchen or bake-oven fire, that answers a splendid purpose; but\r\nin the single wards it is not necessary to keep up a constant fire; a\r\nfew sticks of wood every morning answer the purpose of keeping the air\r\nin the shaft warmer than the surrounding atmosphere, which, of course,\r\ncreates the proper draught.\r\n\r\nThese shafts were made very large--never less than thirty inches square\r\nand sometimes three feet by six feet. The popular plan of opening the\r\nwater-closet windows and allowing much of the fresh air to enter the\r\nbuilding that way was strenuously avoided; the windows in the closet were\r\nfastened shut, and then the air to supply this large exhaust shaft was\r\ndrawn from the adjoining ward or room, which ventilated that ward and\r\nprevented any unpleasant odor from the closets returning into the ward.\r\n\r\nWherever it was possible, a sheet iron or cast iron pipe was carried up\r\ninto the centre of this shaft from the kitchen, laundry, bakery or any\r\nother constant fire, and where no heat from a permanent fire or from a\r\nsteam coil could be obtained, a small stove for the purpose was provided.\r\n\r\n                                                        LEWIS W.

I am much\r\n    interested in them, and think the views given are correct. I\r\n    hope they will be widely circulated. Too much cannot be said to\r\n    the people upon the subject.\r\n\r\n    Ventilation is all-important. Indeed, I think that if the air\r\n    could be constantly kept in motion, the worst sources of impure\r\n    air in our cities would be rendered almost free from danger.\r\n\r\n    In seasons of epidemic cholera, the most oppressive feature of\r\n    danger is the stagnation which exists in the atmosphere. There\r\n    was good sense and true philosophy in the old custom of burning\r\n    bonfires to keep off disease.

I heartily thank you for the thoughtful care\r\n    with which you have set forth all the essential principles of\r\n    ventilation, in language so free from technical words, and so full\r\n    of plain and homely illustration, that even an uneducated reader\r\n    can fully understand all you have written. The good Dr. D. Boswell\r\n    Reid, Dr. Wyman and myself had each attempted to use such a style\r\n    of explanation and instruction; but you have far excelled us all.\r\n\r\n    The first want of every living being is fresh air, and unless the\r\n    human lungs are supplied with such air constantly at the rate of\r\n    from ten to thirty cubic feet every minute, by night as well as\r\n    by day, perfect health and vigor cannot be preserved. Then, too,\r\n    there are exhaled from the surface of the body and from the lungs,\r\n    such quantities of waste organic matter, which tend to immediate\r\n    putridity, that it, together with the carbonic acid, would keep\r\n    the human body immersed in a deadly vapor of these exhalations,\r\n    were not fresh air supplied. The illustrations by which you have\r\n    made these truths easily understood, are admirably given in your\r\n    lectures, and the method, by which you would best insure success\r\n    in removing the foul and supplying the pure fresh air in every\r\n    place where persons live or sleep, are, as I believe, from my own\r\n    careful studies of this subject, most correct and trustworthy.\r\n    Indeed, I am able to say that, in my examinations of the vast\r\n    number of hospitals and buildings which you ventilated during\r\n    the late war, under authority from the intelligent and humane\r\n    Quartermaster-General of the army, the proof of entire success\r\n    in your work was everywhere witnessed. Simplicity, invariable\r\n    certainty and a liberal sufficiency characterizes these admirable\r\n    methods of yours.\r\n\r\n    I wish every family in the land had a copy of these lectures.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                  ELISHA HARRIS, M.

LEEDS was employed early in the war of the rebellion\r\n    by the Sanitary Commission, as an agent to urge the necessity to\r\n    the health and strength of the army, of the thorough ventilation\r\n    of tents and quarters, and to devise and suggest to the proper\r\n    officers the adoption of the best means for this purpose.\r\n\r\n    At a later period of the war, at the suggestion of the Commission,\r\n    the Quartermaster's Department engaged his services, and gave him\r\n    large discretionary powers for the ventilation of hospitals. He\r\n    was thus employed during all of the war, with great advantage,\r\n    and the improvements which he brought about were unquestionably\r\n    the means of saving thousands of lives. * * * *\r\n\r\n    Mr. Leeds has a special talent for making improvements in houses of\r\n    ordinary construction, by means which may be readily adopted, and\r\n    with materials which may be anywhere procured without difficulty\r\n    or great expense.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Leeds' course of lectures on Ventilation is calculated to\r\n    supply instructions of great practical utility. An invaluable\r\n    addition to the health, happiness and wealth of the nation\r\n    would result, if they could be delivered before every school in\r\n    the country.\r\n\r\n                                                     FRED.

Your lectures show a thorough study\r\n    and knowledge of the principles involved, which are, like all\r\n    natural principles, very simple if once understood. I have also\r\n    to take this means of acknowledging the valuable aid that I have\r\n    received from you on many occasions, and to express a hope that\r\n    you will not despair, but relying on the adage that \"truth is\r\n    mighty\" &c., go on with your exposures of the absurdities of the\r\n    complicated and costly humbugs that are so fashionable at present,\r\n    and trust you will succeed not only in your missionary labors,\r\n    but find them pecuniarily profitable.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                         A.
