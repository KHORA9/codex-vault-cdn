In _The Engineer_ for September 17, 1880, we did our best to place a\r\ntrue statement of the facts concerning the Rocket before our readers. In\r\nmany respects this was the most remarkable steam engine ever built, and\r\nabout it there ought to be no difficulty, one would imagine, in arriving at\r\nthe truth. It was for a considerable period the cynosure of all eyes.\r\nEngineers all over the world were interested in its performance. Drawings\r\nwere made of it; accounts were written of it, descriptions of it abounded.\r\nLittle more than half a century has elapsed since it startled the world by\r\nits performance at Rainhill, and yet it is not too much to say that the\r\ntruth--the whole truth, that is to say--can never now be written. We are,\r\nhowever, able to put some facts before our readers now which have never\r\nbefore been published, which are sufficiently startling, and while\r\nsupplying a missing link in the history of the locomotive, go far to show\r\nthat much that has hitherto been held to be true is not true at all.\r\n\r\nWhen the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was opened on the 15th of\r\nSeptember, 1830, among those present was James Nasmyth, subsequently the\r\ninventor of the steam hammer. Mr. Nasmyth was a good freehand draughtsman,\r\nand he sketched the Rocket as it stood on the line. The sketch is still in\r\nexistence. Mr. Nasmyth has placed this sketch at our disposal, thus earning\r\nthe gratitude of our readers, and we have reproduced as nearly as possible,\r\nbut to a somewhat enlarged scale, this invaluable link in the history of\r\nthe locomotive. Mr. Nasmyth writes concerning it, July 26, 1884: \"This\r\nslight and hasty sketch of the Rocket was made the day before the opening\r\nof the Manchester and Liverpool Railway, September 12, 1830. I availed\r\nmyself of the opportunity of a short pause in the experimental runs with\r\nthe Rocket, of three or four miles between Liverpool and Rainhill, George\r\nStephenson acting as engine driver and his son Robert as stoker. The\r\nlimited time I had for making my sketch prevented me from making a more\r\nelaborate one, but such as it is, all the important and characteristic\r\ndetails are given; but the pencil lines, after the lapse of fifty-four\r\nyears, have become somewhat indistinct.\" The pencil drawing, more than\r\nfifty years old, has become so faint that its reproduction has become a\r\ndifficult task. Enough remains, however, to show very clearly what manner\r\nof engine this Rocket was. For the sake of comparison we reproduce an\r\nengraving of the Rocket of 1829. A glance will show that an astonishing\r\ntransformation had taken place in the eleven months which had elapsed\r\nbetween the Rainhill trials and the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nRailway. We may indicate a few of the alterations. In 1829 the cylinders\r\nwere set at a steep angle; in 1830 they were nearly horizontal. In 1829 the\r\ndriving wheels were of wood; in 1830 they were of cast iron. In 1829 there\r\nwas no smoke-box proper, and a towering chimney; in 1830 there was a\r\nsmoke-box and a comparatively short chimney. In 1829 a cask and a truck\r\nconstituted the tender; in 1830 there was a neatly designed tender, not\r\nvery different in style from that still in use on the Great Western broad\r\ngauge. All these things may perhaps be termed concomitants, or changes in\r\ndetail. But there is a radical difference yet to be considered. In 1829 the\r\nfire-box was a kind of separate chamber tacked on to the back of the barrel\r\nof the boiler, and communicating with it by three tubes; one on each side\r\nunited the water spaces, and one at the top the steam spaces. In 1830 all\r\nthis had disappeared, and we find in Mr. Nasmyth's sketch a regular\r\nfire-box, such as is used to this moment. In one word, the Rocket of 1829\r\nis different from the Rocket of 1830 in almost every conceivable respect;\r\nand we are driven perforce to the conclusion that the Rocket of 1829\r\n_never worked at all on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway; the engine of\r\n1830 was an entirely new engine_. We see no possible way of escaping from\r\nthis conclusion. The most that can be said against it is that the engine\r\nunderwent many alterations. The alterations must, however, have been so\r\nnumerous that they were tantamount to the construction of a new engine. It\r\nis difficult, indeed, to see what part of the old engine could exist in the\r\nnew one; some plates of the boiler shell might, perhaps, have been\r\nretained, but we doubt it. It may, perhaps, disturb some hitherto well\r\nrooted beliefs to say so, but it seems to us indisputable that the Rocket\r\nof 1829 and 1830 were totally different engines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. THE ROCKET, 1829. THE ROCKET, 1830.]\r\n\r\nOur engraving, Fig. 1, is copied from a drawing made by Mr. Phipps,\r\nM.I.C.E., who was employed by Messrs. Stephenson to compile a drawing of\r\nthe Rocket from such drawings and documents as could be found. This\r\ngentleman had made the original drawings of the Rocket of 1829, under\r\nMessrs. G. & R. Stephenson's direction. Mr. Phipps is quite silent about\r\nthe history of the engine during the eleven months between the Rainhill\r\ntrials and the opening of the railway. In this respect he is like every one\r\nelse. This period is a perfect blank. It is assumed that from Rainhill the\r\nengine went back to Messrs. Stephenson's works; but there is nothing on the\r\nsubject in print, so far as we are aware. Mr. G.R. Stephenson lent us in\r\n1880 a working model of the Rocket. An engraving of this will be found in\r\n_The Engineer_ for September 17, 1880. The difference between it and the\r\nengraving below, prepared from Mr. Phipps' drawing, is, it will be seen,\r\nvery small--one of proportions more than anything else. Mr. Stephenson says\r\nof his model: \"I can say that it is a very fair representation of what the\r\nengine was before she was altered.\" Hitherto it has always been taken for\r\ngranted that the alteration consisted mainly in reducing the angle at which\r\nthe cylinders were set. The Nasmyth drawing alters the whole aspect of the\r\nquestion, and we are now left to speculate as to what became of the\r\noriginal Rocket. We are told that after \"it\" left the railway it was\r\nemployed by Lord Dundonald to supply steam to a rotary engine; then it\r\npropelled a steamboat; next it drove small machinery in a shop in\r\nManchester; then it was employed in a brickyard; eventually it was\r\npurchased as a curiosity by Mr. Thomson, of Kirkhouse, near Carlisle, who\r\nsent it to Messrs. Stephenson to take care of. With them it remained for\r\nyears. Then Messrs. Stephenson put it into something like its original\r\nshape, and it went to South Kensington Museum, where \"it\" is now. The\r\nquestion is, What engine is this? Was it the Rocket of 1829 or the Rocket\r\nof 1830, or neither? It could not be the last, as will be understood from\r\nMr. Nasmyth's drawing; if we bear in mind that the so-called fire-box on\r\nthe South Kensington engine is only a sham made of thin sheet iron without\r\nwater space, while the fire-box shown in Mr. Nasmyth's engine is an\r\nintegral part of the whole, which could not have been cut off. That is to\r\nsay, Messrs. Stephenson, in getting the engine put in order for the Patent\r\nOffice Museum, certainly did not cut off the fire-box shown in Mr.\r\nNasmyth's sketch, and replace it with the sham box now on the boiler. If\r\nour readers will turn to our impression for the 30th of June, 1876, they\r\nwill find a very accurate engraving of the South Kensington engine, which\r\nthey can compare with Mr. Nasmyth's sketch, and not fail to perceive that\r\nthe differences are radical.\r\n\r\nIn \"Wood on Railroads,\" second edition, 1832, page 377, we are told that\r\n\"after those experiments\"--the Rainhill trials--\"were concluded, the\r\nNovelty underwent considerable alterations;\" and on page 399, \"Mr.\r\nStephenson had also improved the working of the Rocket engine, and by\r\napplying the steam more powerfully in the chimney to increase the draught,\r\nwas enabled to raise a much greater quantity of steam than before.\" Nothing\r\nis said as to where the new experiments took place, nor their precise date.\r\nBut it seems that the Meteor and the Arrow--Stephenson engines--were tried\r\nat the same time; and this is really the only hint Wood gives as to what\r\nwas done to the Rocket between the 6th of October, 1829, and the 15th of\r\nSeptember, 1830.\r\n\r\nThere are men still alive who no doubt could clear up the question at\r\nissue, and it is much to be hoped that they will do so. As the matter now\r\nstands, it will be seen that we do not so much question that the Rocket in\r\nSouth Kensington Museum is, in part perhaps, the original Rocket of\r\nRainhill celebrity, as that it ever ran in regular service on the Liverpool\r\nand Manchester Railway. Yet, if not, then we may ask, what became of the\r\nRocket of 1830? It is not at all improbable that the first Rocket was cast\r\non one side, until it was bought by Lord Dundonald, and that its history is\r\nset out with fair accuracy above. But the Rocket of the Manchester and\r\nLiverpool Railway is hardly less worthy of attention than its immediate\r\npredecessor, and concerning it information is needed. Any scrap of\r\ninformation, however apparently trifling, that can be thrown on this\r\nsubject by our readers will be highly valued, and given an appropriate\r\nplace in our pages.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe largest grain elevator in the world, says the _Nashville American_, is\r\nthat just constructed at Newport News under the auspices of the Chesapeake\r\n& Ohio Railway Co. It is 90 ft. wide, 386 ft. long, and about 164 ft. high,\r\nwith engine and boiler rooms 40 × 100 ft. and 40 ft. high. In its\r\nconstruction there were used about 3,000 piles, 100,000 ft. of white-oak\r\ntimber, 82,000 cu. ft. of stone, 800,000 brick, 6,000,000 ft. of pine and\r\nspruce lumber, 4,500 kegs of nails, 6 large boilers, 2 large engines, 200\r\ntons of machinery, 20 large hopper-scales, and 17,200 ft. of rubber belts,\r\nfrom 8 to 48 in. wide and 50 to 1,700 ft. long; in addition, there were\r\n8,000 elevator buckets, and other material. The storage capacity is\r\n1,600,000 bushels, with a receiving capacity of 30,000, and a shipping\r\ncapacity of 20,000 bushels per hour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLOW OF WATER THROUGH TURBINES AND SCREW PROPELLERS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Paper read before the British Association at Montreal.]\r\n\r\nBy Mr. ARTHUR RIGG, C.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature relating to turbines probably stands unrivaled among all that\r\nconcerns questions of hydraulic engineering, not so much in its voluminous\r\ncharacter as in the extent to which purely theoretical writers have ignored\r\nfacts, or practical writers have relied upon empirical rules rather than\r\nupon any sound theory. In relation to this view, it may suffice to note\r\nthat theoretical deductions have frequently been based upon a\r\ngeneralization that \"streams of water must enter the buckets of a turbine\r\nwithout shock, and leave them without velocity.\" Both these assumed\r\nconditions are misleading, and it is now well known that in every good\r\nturbine both are carefully disobeyed. So-called practical writers, as a\r\nrule, fail to give much useful information, and their task seems rather in\r\npraise of one description of turbine above another. But generally, it is of\r\nno consequence whatever how a stream of water may be led through the\r\nbuckets of any form of turbine, so long as its velocity gradually becomes\r\nreduced to the smallest amount that will carry it freely clear of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe character of theoretical information imparted by some _Chicago Journal\r\nof Commerce_, dated 20th February, 1884. There we are informed that \"the\r\nheight of the fall is one of the most important considerations, as the same\r\nstream of water will furnish five times the horse power at ten ft. that it\r\nwill at five ft. fall.\" By general consent twice two are four, but it has\r\nbeen reserved for this imaginative writer to make the useful discovery that\r\nsometimes twice two are ten. Not until after the translation of Captain\r\nMorris' work on turbines by Mr. E. Morris in 1844, was attention in America\r\ndirected to the advantages which these motors possessed over the gravity\r\nwheels then in use. A duty of 75 per cent. was then obtained, and a further\r\nstudy of the subject by a most acute and practical engineer, Mr. Boyden,\r\nled to various improvements upon Mr. Fauneyron's model, by which his\r\nexperiments indicated the high duty of 88 per cent. The most conspicuous\r\naddition made by Mr. Boyden was the diffuser. The ingenious contrivance had\r\nthe effect of transforming part of whatever velocity remained in the stream\r\nafter passing out of a turbine into an atmospheric pressure, by which the\r\ncorresponding lost head became effective, and added about 3 per cent. to\r\nthe duty obtained. It may be worth noticing that, by an accidental\r\napplication of these principles to some inward flow turbines, there is\r\nobtained most, if not all, of whatever advantage they are supposed to\r\npossess, but oddly enough this genuine advantage is never mentioned by any\r\nof the writers who are interested in their introduction or sale. The\r\nwell-known experiments of Mr. James B. Francis in 1857, and his elaborate\r\nreport, gave to hydraulic engineers a vast store of useful data, and since\r\nthat period much progress has been made in the construction of turbines,\r\nand literature on the subject has become very complete.\r\n\r\nIn the limits of a short paper it is impossible to do justice to more than\r\none aspect of the considerations relating to turbines, and it is now\r\nproposed to bring before the Mechanical Section of the British Association\r\nsome conclusions drawn from the behavior of jets of water discharged under\r\npressure, more particularly in the hope that, as water power is extremely\r\nabundant in Canada, any remarks relating to the subject may not fail to\r\nprove interesting.\r\n\r\nBetween the action of turbines and that of screw propellers exists an exact\r\nparallelism, although in one case water imparts motion to the buckets of a\r\nturbine, while in the other case blades of a screw give spiral movement to\r\na column of water driven aft from the vessel it propels forward. Turbines\r\nhave been driven sometimes by impact alone, sometimes by reaction above,\r\nthough generally by a combination of impact and reaction, and it is by the\r\nlast named system that the best results are now known to be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary paddles of a steamer impel a mass of water horizontally\r\nbackward by impact alone, but screw propellers use reaction somewhat\r\ndisguised, and only to a limited extent. The full use and advantages of\r\nreaction for screw propellers were not generally known until after the\r\npublication of papers by the present writer in the \"Proceedings\" of the\r\nInstitution of Naval Architects for 1867 and 1868, and more fully in the\r\n\"Transactions\" of the Society of Engineers for 1868. Since that time, by\r\nthe author of these investigations then described, by the English\r\nAdmiralty, and by private firms, further experiments have been carried out,\r\nsome on a considerable scale, and all corroborative of the results\r\npublished in 1868. But nothing further has been done in utilizing these\r\ndiscoveries until the recent exigencies of modern naval warfare have led\r\nforeign nations to place a high value upon speed. Some makers of torpedo\r\nboats have thus been induced to slacken the trammels of an older theory and\r\nto apply a somewhat incomplete form of the author's reaction propeller for\r\ngaining some portion of the notable performance of these hornets of the\r\ndeep. Just as in turbines a combination of impact and reaction produces the\r\nmaximum practical result, so in screw propellers does a corresponding gain\r\naccompany the same construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n_Turbines_.--While studying those effects produced by jets of water\r\nimpinging upon plain or concave surfaces corresponding to buckets of\r\nturbines, it simplifies matters to separate these results due to impact\r\nfrom others due to reaction. And it will be well at the outset to draw a\r\ndistinction between the nature of these two pressures, and to remind\r\nourselves of the laws which lie at the root and govern the whole question\r\nunder present consideration. Water obeys the laws of gravity, exactly like\r\nevery other body; and the velocity with which any quantity may be falling\r\nis an expression of the full amount of work it contains. By a sufficiently\r\naccurate practical rule this velocity is eight times the square root of the\r\nhead or vertical column measured in feet. Velocity per second = 8 sqrt\r\n(head in feet), therefore, for a head of 100 ft. as an example, V = 8 sqrt\r\n(100) = 80 ft. per second. The graphic method of showing velocities or\r\npressures has many advantages, and is used in all the following diagrams.\r\nBeginning with purely theoretical considerations, we must first recollect\r\nthat there is no such thing as absolute motion. All movements are relative\r\nto something else, and what we have to do with a stream of water in a\r\nturbine is to reduce its velocity relatively to the earth, quite a\r\ndifferent thing to its velocity in relation to the turbine; for while the\r\none may be zero, the other may be anything we please. ABCD in Fig. 1\r\nrepresents a parallelogram of velocities, wherein AC gives the direction of\r\na jet of water starting at A, and arriving at C at the end of one second or\r\nany other division of time. At a scale of 1/40 in. to 1 ft., AC represents\r\n80 ft., the fall due to 100 ft. head, or at a scale of 1 in. to 1 ft., AC\r\ngives 2 ft., or the distance traveled by the same stream in 1/40 of a\r\nsecond. The velocity AC may be resolved into two others, namely, AB and AD,\r\nor BC, which are found to be 69.28 ft. and 40 ft. respectively, when the\r\nangle BAC--generally called _x_ in treatises on turbines--is 30 deg. If,\r\nhowever, AC is taken at 2 ft., then A B will be found = 20.78 in., and BC =\r\n12 in. for a time of 1/40 or 0.025 of a second. Supposing now a flat plate,\r\nBC = 12 in. wide move from DA to CB during 0.025 second, it will be readily\r\nseen that a drop of water starting from A will have arrived at C in 0.025\r\nsecond, having been flowing along the surface BC from B to C without either\r\nfriction or loss of velocity. If now, instead of a straight plate, BC, we\r\nsubstitute one having a concave surface, such as BK in Fig. 2, it will be\r\nfound necessary to move it from A to L in 0.025 second, in order to allow a\r\nstream to arrive at C, that is K, without, in transit, friction or loss of\r\nvelocity. This concave surface may represent one bucket of a turbine.\r\nSupposing now a resistance to be applied to that it can only move from A to\r\nB instead of to L. Then, as we have already resolved the velocity A C into\r\nAB and BC, so far as the former (AB) is concerned, no alteration occurs\r\nwhether BK be straight or curved. But the other portion, BC, pressing\r\nvertically against the concave surface, BK, becomes gradually diminished in\r\nits velocity in relation to the earth, and produces and effect known as\r\n\"reaction.\" A combined operation of impact and reaction occurs by further\r\ndiminishing the distance which the bucket is allowed to travel, as, for\r\nexamples, to EF. Here the jet is impelled against the lower edge of the\r\nbucket, B, and gives a pressure by its impact; then following the curve BK,\r\nwith a diminishing velocity, it is finally discharged at K, retaining only\r\nsufficient movement to carry the water clear out of the machine. Thus far\r\nwe have considered the movement of jets and buckets along AB as straight\r\nlines, but this can only occur, so far as buckets are concerned, when their\r\nradius in infinite. In practice these latter movements are always curves of\r\nmore or less complicated form, which effect a considerable modification in\r\nthe forms of buckets, etc., but not in the general principles, and it is\r\nthe duty of the designer of any form of turbine to give this consideration\r\nits due importance. Having thus cleared away any ambiguity from the terms\r\n\"impact,\" and \"reaction,\" and shown how they can act independently or\r\ntogether, we shall be able to follow the course and behavior of streams in\r\na turbine, and by treating their effects as arising from two separate\r\ncauses, we shall be able to regard the problem without that inevitable\r\nconfusion which arises when they are considered as acting conjointly.\r\nTurbines, though driven by vast volumes of water, are in reality impelled\r\nby countless isolated jets, or streams, all acting together, and a clear\r\nunderstanding of the behavior of any one of these facilitates and concludes\r\na solution of the whole problem.\r\n\r\n_Experimental researches_.--All experiments referred to in this paper were\r\nmade by jets of water under an actual vertical head of 45 ft., but as the\r\nsupply came through a considerable length of ½ in. bore lead piping, and\r\nmany bends, a large and constant loss occurred through friction and bends,\r\nso that the actual working head was only known by measuring the velocity of\r\ndischarge. This was easily done by allowing all the water to flow into a\r\ntank of known capacity. The stop cock had a clear circular passage through\r\nit, and two different jets were used. One oblong measured 0.5 in. by 0.15\r\nin., giving an area of 0.075 square inch. The other jet was circular, and\r\njust so much larger than ¼ in. to be 0.05 of a square inch area, and the\r\nstream flowed with a velocity of 40 ft. per second, corresponding to a head\r\nof 25 ft. Either nozzle could be attached to the same universal joint, and\r\ndirected at any desired inclination upon the horizontal surface of a\r\nspecial well-adjusted compound weighing machine, or into various bent tubes\r\nand other attachments, so that all pressures, whether vertical or\r\nhorizontal, could be accurately ascertained and reduced to the unit, which\r\nwas the quarter of an ounce. The vertical component _p_ of any pressure P\r\nmay be ascertained by the formula--\r\n\r\n    _p_ = P sin alpha,\r\n\r\nwhere alpha is the angle made by a jet against a surface; and in order to\r\ntest the accuracy of the simple machinery employed for these researches,\r\nthe oblong jet which gave 71 unit when impinging vertically upon a circular\r\nplate, was directed at 60 deg. and 45 deg. thereon, with results shown in\r\nTable I., and these, it will be observed, are sufficiently close to theory\r\nto warrant reliance being placed on data obtained from the simple weighing\r\nmachinery used in the experiment.\r\n\r\n                 _Table I.--Impact on Level Plate._\r\n--------------+--------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n              | Inclination of jet |          |          |\r\n  Distance.   | to the horizonal.  |  90 deg. |  60 deg. |  45 deg.\r\n--------------+--------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n              |                    | Pressure | Pressure | Pressure\r\n              |                    |          |          |\r\n            / |  Experiment    \\   |        / |   61.00  |   49.00\r\n 1½ in.    <  |                 >  | 71.00 <  |          |\r\n            \\ |  Theory        /   |        \\ |   61.48  |   50.10\r\n              |                    |          |          |\r\n              |                    |          |          |\r\n            / |  Experiment    \\   |        / |   55.00  |   45.00\r\n 1 in.     <  |                 >  | 63.00 <  |          |\r\n            \\ |  Theory        /   |        \\ |   54.00  |   45.00\r\n              |                    |          |          |\r\n--------------+--------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n             In each case the unit of pressure is ¼ oz.\r\n\r\nIn the first trial there was a distance of 1½ in. between the jet and point\r\nof its contact with the plate, while in the second trial this space was\r\ndiminished to ½ in. It will be noticed that as this distance increases we\r\nhave augmented pressures, and these are not due, as might be supposed, to\r\nincrease of head, which is practically nothing, but they are due to the\r\nrecoil of a portion of the stream, which occurs increasingly as it becomes\r\nmore and more broken up. These alterations in pressure can only be\r\neliminated when care is taken to measure that only due to impact, without\r\nat the same time adding the effect of an imperfect reaction. Any stream\r\nthat can run off at all points from a smooth surface gives the minimum of\r\npressure thereon, for then the least resistance is offered to the\r\ndestruction of the vertical element of its velocity, but this freedom\r\nbecomes lost when a stream is diverted into a confined channel. As pressure\r\nis an indication and measure of lost velocity, we may then reasonably look\r\nfor greater pressure on the scale when a stream is confined after impact\r\nthan when it discharges freely in every direction. Experimentally this is\r\nshown to be the case, for when the same oblong jet, discharged under the\r\nsame conditions, impinged vertically upon a smooth plate, and gave a\r\npressure of 71 units, gave 87 units when discharged into a confined\r\nright-angled channel. This result emphasizes the necessity for confining\r\nstreams of water whenever it is desired to receive the greatest pressure by\r\narresting their velocity. Such streams will always endeavor to escape in\r\nthe directions of least resistance, and, therefore, in a turbine means\r\nshould be provided to prevent any lateral deviation of the streams while\r\npassing through their buckets. So with screw propellers the great mass of\r\nsurrounding water may be regarded as acting like a channel with elastic\r\nsides, which permits the area enlarging as the velocity of a current\r\npassing diminishes. The experiments thus far described have been made with\r\njets of an oblong shape, and they give results differing in some degree\r\nfrom those obtained with circular jets. Yet as the general conclusions from\r\nboth are found the same, it will avoid unnecessary prolixity by using the\r\ndata from experiments made with a circular jet of 0.05 square inch area,\r\ndischarging a stream at the rate of 40 ft. per second. This amounts to 52\r\nlb. of water per minute with an available head of 25 ft., or 1,300\r\nfoot-pounds per minute. The tubes which received and directed the course of\r\nthis jet were generally of lead, having a perfectly smooth internal\r\nsurface, for it was found that with a rougher surface the flow of water is\r\nretarded, and changes occur in the data obtained. Any stream having its\r\ncourse changed presses against the body causing such change, this pressure\r\nincreasing in proportion to the angle through which the change is made, and\r\nalso according to the radius of a curve around which it flows. This fact\r\nhas long been known to hydraulic engineers, and formulæ exist by which such\r\npressures can be determined; nevertheless, it will be useful to study these\r\nrelations from a somewhat different point of view than has been hitherto\r\nadopted, more particularly as they bear upon the construction of screw\r\npropellers and turbines; and by directing the stream, AB, Fig. 3,\r\nvertically into a tube 3/8 in. internal diameter and bent so as to turn the\r\njet horizontally, and placing the whole arrangement upon a compound\r\nweighing machine, it is easy to ascertain the downward pressure, AB, due to\r\nimpact, and the horizontal pressures, CB, due to reaction. In theoretical\r\ninvestigations it may be convenient to assume both these pressures exactly\r\nequal, and this has been done in the paper \"On Screw Propellers\" already\r\nreferred to; but this brings in an error of no importance so far as general\r\nprinciples are involved, but one which destroys much of the value such\r\nresearches might, otherwise possess for those who are engaged in the\r\npractical construction of screw propellers or turbines. The downward impact\r\npressure, AB, is always somewhat greater than the horizontal reaction, BC,\r\nand any proportions between these two can only be accurately ascertained by\r\ntrials. In these particular experiments the jet of water flowed 40 ft. per\r\nsecond through an orifice of 0.05 square inch area, and in every case its\r\ncourse was bent to a right angle. The pressures for impact and reaction\r\nwere weighed coincidently, with results given by columns 1 and 2, Table II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\r\n\r\n_Table II.--Impact and Reaction in Confined Channels._\r\n\r\n-----------------------------+-------+---------+----------+-------\r\nNumber of column.            |   1   |    2    |    3     |   4\r\n-----------------------------+-------+---------+----------+-------\r\nDescription of experiments.  |Impact.|Reaction.|Resultant.| Angles\r\n                             |       |         |          |  ABS.\r\n-----------------------------+-------+---------+----------+-------\r\nSmooth London tube, 1¾ in.   |  71   |   62    |  94.25   |   49°\r\n  mean radius.               |       |         |          |\r\n                             |       |         |          |\r\nRough wrought iron tube,     |  78   |   52    |  98.75   |  56.5°\r\n  1¾ in.                     |       |         |          |\r\n                             |       |         |          |\r\nSmooth leaden tube bent to a |  71   |   40    |  81.5    |   60\r\n  sharp right angle.         |       |         |          |\r\n-----------------------------+-------+---------+----------+------\r\n\r\nThe third column is obtained by constructing a parallelogram of forces,\r\nwhere impact and reaction form the measures of opposing sides, and it\r\nfurnishes the resultant due to both forces. The fourth column gives the\r\ninclination ABS, at which the line of impact must incline toward a plane\r\nsurface RS, Fig. 3, so as to produce this maximum resultant perpendicularly\r\nupon it; as the resultant given in column 3 indicates the full practical\r\neffect of impact and reaction. When a stream has its direction changed to\r\none at right angles to its original course, and as such a changed direction\r\nis all that can be hoped for by ordinary screw propellers, the figures in\r\ncolumn 3 should bear some relationship to such cases. Therefore, it becomes\r\nan inquiry of some interest as to what angle of impact has been found best\r\nin those screw propellers which have given the best results in practical\r\nwork. Taking one of the most improved propellers made by the late Mr.\r\nRobert Griffiths, its blades do not conform to the lines of a true screw,\r\nbut it is an oblique paddle, where the acting portions of its blades were\r\nset at 48 deg. to the keel of the ship or 42 deg. to the plane of rotation.\r\nAgain, taking a screw tug boat on the river Thames, with blades of a\r\ntotally different form to those used by Mr. Griffiths, we still find them\r\nset at the same angle, namely, 48 deg. to the keel or 42 deg. to the plane\r\nof rotation. An examination of other screws tends only to confirm these\r\nfigures, and they justify the conclusion that the inclinations of blades\r\nfound out by practice ought to be arrived at, or at any rate approached, by\r\nany sound and reliable theory; and that blades of whatever form must not\r\ntransgress far from this inclination if they are to develop any\r\nconsiderable efficiency. Indeed, many favorable results obtained by\r\npropellers are not due to their peculiarities, but only to the fact that\r\nthey have been made with an inclination of blade not far from 42 deg. to\r\nthe plan of rotation. Referring to column 4, and accepting the case of\r\nwater flowing through a smooth tube as analogous to that of a current\r\nflowing within a large body of water, it appears that the inclination\r\nnecessary to give the highest resultant pressure is an angle of 49 deg.,\r\nand this corresponds closely enough with the angle which practical\r\nconstructors of screw propellers have found to give the best results.\r\nUntil, therefore, we can deal with currents after they have been\r\ndischarged from the blades of a propeller, it seems unlikely that anything\r\ncan be done by alterations in the pitch of a propeller. So far as concerns\r\ntheory, the older turbines were restricted to such imperfect results of\r\nimpact and reaction as might be obtained by turning a stream at right\r\nangles to its original course; and the more scientific of modern turbine\r\nconstructors may fairly claim credit for an innovation by which practice\r\ngave better results than theory seemed to warrant; and the consideration of\r\nthis aspect of the question will form the concluding subject of the present\r\npaper. Referring again to Fig. 3, when a current passes round such a curve\r\nas the quadrant of a circle, its horizontal reaction appears as a pressure\r\nalong _c_ B, which is the result of the natural integration of all the\r\nhorizontal components of pressures, all of which act perpendicularly to\r\neach element of the concave surface along which the current flows. If, now,\r\nwe add another quadrant of a circle to the curve, and so turn the stream\r\nthrough two right angles, or 180 deg., as shown by Fig. 4, then such a\r\ncomplete reversal of the original direction represents the carrying of it\r\nback again to the highest point; it means the entire destruction of its\r\nvelocity, and it gives the maximum pressure obtainable from a jet of water\r\nimpinging upon a surface of any form whatsoever. The reaction noticed in\r\nFig. 3 as acting along _c_ B is now confronted by an impact of the now\r\nhorizontal stream as it is turned round the second 90 deg. of curvature,\r\nand reacts also vertically downward. It would almost seem as if the first\r\nreaction from B to F should be exactly neutralized by the second impact\r\nfrom F to D. But such is not the case, as experiment shows an excess of the\r\nsecond impact over the first reaction amounting to six units, and shows\r\nalso that the behavior of the stream through its second quadrant is\r\nprecisely similar in kind to the first, only less in degree. Also the\r\nimpact takes place vertically in one case and horizontally in the other.\r\nThe total downward pressure given by the stream when turned 180 deg. is\r\nfound by experiment thus: Total impact and reaction from 180 deg. change in\r\ndirection of current = 132 units; and by deducting the impact 71 units, as\r\npreviously measured, the new reaction corresponds with an increase of 61\r\nunits above the first impact. It also shows an increase of 37.75 units\r\nabove the greatest resultant obtained by the same stream turned through 90\r\ndeg. only. Therefore, in designing a screw propeller or turbine, it would\r\nseem from these experiments desirable to aim at changing the direction of\r\nthe stream, so far as possible, into one at 180 deg. to its original\r\ncourse, and it is by carrying out this view, so far as the necessities of\r\nconstruction will permit, that the scientifically designed modern turbine\r\nhas attained to that prominence which it holds at present over all\r\nhydraulic motors. Much more might be written to extend and amplify the\r\nconclusions that can be drawn from the experiments described in the present\r\npaper, and from many others made by the writer, but the exigencies of time\r\nand your patience alike preclude further consideration of this interesting\r\nand important subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED TEXTILE MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TEXTILE EXHIBITION, ISLINGTON.]\r\n\r\nIn the recent textile exhibition at Islington, one of the most extensive\r\nexhibits was that, of Messrs. James Farmer and Sons, of Salford. The\r\nexhibit consists of a Universal calender, drying machines, patent creasing,\r\nmeasuring, and marking machines, and apparatus for bleaching, washing,\r\nchloring, scouring, soaping, dunging, and dyeing woven fabrics. The purpose\r\nof the Universal calender is, says the _Engineer_, to enable limited\r\nquantities of goods to be finished in various ways without requiring\r\ndifferent machines. The machine consists of suitable framing, to which is\r\nattached all the requisite stave rails, batching apparatus, compound\r\nlevers, top and bottom adjusting screws, and level setting down gear, also\r\nStanley roller with all its adjustments. It is furthermore supplied with\r\nchasing arrangement and four bowls; the bottom one is of cast iron, with\r\nwrought iron center; the next is of paper or cotton; the third of chilled\r\niron fitted for heating by steam or gas, and the top of paper or cotton. By\r\nthis machine are given such finishes as are known as \"chasing finish\" when\r\nthe thready surface is wanted; \"frictioning,\" or what is termed \"glazing\r\nfinish,\" \"swigging finish,\" and \"embossing finish;\" the later is done by\r\nsubstituting a steel or copper engraved roller in place of the friction\r\nbowl. This machine is also made to I produce the \"Moire luster\" finish. The\r\ndrying machine consists of nineteen cylinders, arranged with stave rails\r\nand plaiting down apparatus. These cylinders are driven by bevel wheels, so\r\nthat each one is independent of its neighbor, and should any accident occur\r\nto one or more of the cylinders or wheels, the remaining ones can be run\r\nuntil a favorable opportunity arrives to repair the damage. A small\r\nseparate double cylinder diagonal engine is fitted to this machine, the\r\nspeed of which can be adjusted for any texture of cloth, and being of the\r\ndesign it is, will start at once on steam being turned one. The machine\r\ncylinders are rolled by a special machine for that purpose, and are\r\nperfectly true on the face. Their insides are fitted with patent buckets,\r\nwhich remove all the condensed water. In the machine exhibited, which is\r\ndesigned for the bleaching, washing, chloring, and dyeing, the cloth is\r\nsupported by hollow metallic cylinders perforated with holes and corrugated\r\nto allow the liquor used to pass freely through as much of the cloth as\r\npossible; the open ends of the cylinders are so arranged that nearly all of\r\ntheir area is open to the action of the pump. The liquor, which is drawn\r\nthrough the cloth into the inside of the cylinders by the centrifugal\r\npumps, is discharged back into the cistern by a specially constructed\r\ndischarge pipe, so devised that the liquor, which is sent into it with\r\ngreat force by the pump, is diverted so as to pour straight down in order\r\nto prevent any eddies which could cause the cloth to wander from its\r\ncourse. The cloth is supported to and from the cylinders by flat perforated\r\nplates in such a manner that the force of the liquor cannot bag or displace\r\nthe threads of the cloth, and by this means also the liquor has a further\r\ntendency to penetrate the fibers of the cloth. Means are provided for\r\nreadily and expeditiously cleansing the entire machine. The next machine\r\nwhich we have to notice in this exhibit is Farmer's patent marking and\r\nmeasuring machine, the purpose of which is to stamp on the cloths the\r\nlengths of the same at regular distances. It is very desirable that drapers\r\nshould have some simple means of discovering at a glance what amount of\r\nmaterial they have in stock without the necessity of unrolling their cloth\r\nto measure it, and this machine seems to perfectly meet the demands of the\r\ncase. The arrangement for effecting the printing and inking is shown in our\r\nengraving at A. It is contained within a small disk, which can be moved at\r\nwill, so that it can be adapted to various widths of cloth or other\r\nmaterial. A measuring roller runs beside the printing disk, and on this is\r\nstamped the required figures by a simple contrivance at the desired\r\ndistances, say every five yards. The types are linked together into a\r\nroller chain which is carried by the disk, A, and they ink themselves\r\nautomatically from a flannel pad. The machine works in this way: The end of\r\nthe piece to be measured is brought down until it touches the surface of\r\nthe table, the marker is turned to zero, and also the finger of the dial on\r\nthe end of the measuring roller. The machine is then started, and the\r\nlengths are printed at the required distances until it becomes necessary to\r\ncut out the first piecing or joint in the fabric. The dial registers the\r\ntotal length of the piece.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDLESS ROPE HAULAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the North of England Report, the endless rope systems are classified as\r\nNo. 1 and No 2 systems. No. 1, which has the rope under the tubs, is said\r\nto be in operation in the Midland counties. To give motion to the rope a\r\nsingle wheel is used, and friction for driving the rope is supplied either\r\nby clip pulleys or by taking the rope over several wheels. The diagram\r\nshows an arrangement for a tightening arrangement. One driving wheel is\r\nused, says _The Colliery Guardian_, and the rope is kept constantly tight\r\nby passing it round a pulley fixed upon a tram to which a heavy weight is\r\nattached. Either one or two lines of rails are used. When a single line is\r\nadopted the rope works backward and forward, only one part being on the\r\nwagon way and the other running by the side of the way. When two lines are\r\nused the ropes move always in one direction, the full tubs coming out on\r\none line and the empties going in on the other. The rope passes under the\r\ntubs, and the connection is made by means of a clamp or by sockets in the\r\nrope, to which the set is attached by a short chain. The rope runs at a\r\nmoderately high speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIGHTENING ARRANGEMENT--ENDLESS ROPE HAULAGE.]\r\n\r\nNo. 2 system was peculiar to Wigan. A double line of rails is always used.\r\nThe rope rests upon the tubs, which are attached to the rope either singly\r\nor in sets varying in number from two to twelve. The other engraving shows\r\na mode of connection between the tubs and the rope by a rope loop as shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTACHMENT TO ENDLESS ROPE \"OVER.\"]\r\n\r\nThe tubs are placed at a regular distance apart, and the rope works slowly.\r\nMotion is given to the rope by large driving pulleys, and friction is\r\nobtained by taking the rope several times round the driving pulley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RELIABLE WATER FILTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinions are so firmly fixed at present that water is capable of carrying\r\nthe germs of disease that, in cases of epidemics, the recommendation is\r\nmade to drink natural mineral waters, or to boil ordinary water. This is a\r\nwise measure, assuredly; but mineral waters are expensive, and, moreover,\r\nmany persons cannot get used to them. As for boiled water, that is a\r\nbeverage which has no longer a normal composition; a portion of its salts\r\nhas become precipitated, and its dissolved gases have been given off. In\r\nspite of the aeration that it is afterward made to undergo, it preserves an\r\ninsipid taste, and I believe that it is not very digestible. I have\r\nthought, then, that it would be important, from a hygienic standpoint, to\r\nhave a filter that should effectually rid water of all the microbes or\r\ngerms that it contains, while at the same time preserving the salts or\r\ngases that it holds in solution. I have reached such a result, and,\r\nalthough it is always delicate to speak of things that one has himself\r\ndone, I think the question is too important to allow me to hold back my\r\nopinion in regard to the apparatus. It is a question of general hygiene\r\nbefore which my own personality must disappear completely.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Pasteur's laboratory, we filter the liquids in which microbes have\r\nbeen cultivated, so as to separate them from the medium in which they\r\nexist. For this purpose we employ a small unglazed porcelain tube that we\r\nhave had especially constructed therefor. The liquid traverses the porous\r\nsides of this under the influence of atmospheric pressure, since we cause a\r\nvacuum around the tube by means of an air-pump. We collect in this way,\r\nafter several hours, a few cubic inches of a liquid which is absolutely\r\npure, since animals may be inoculated with it without danger to them, while\r\nthe smallest quantity of the same liquid, when not filtered, infallibly\r\ncauses death.\r\n\r\nThis is the process that I have applied to the filtration of water. I have\r\nintroduced into it merely such modifications as are necessary to render the\r\napparatus entirely practical. My apparatus consists of an unglazed\r\nporcelain tube inverted upon a ring of enameled porcelain, forming a part\r\nthereof, and provided with an aperture for the outflow of the liquid. This\r\ntube is placed within a metallic one, which is directly attached to a cock\r\nthat is soldered to the service pipe. A nut at the base that can be\r\nmaneuvered by hand permits, through the intermedium of a rubber washer\r\nresting upon the enameled ring, of the tube being hermetically closed.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, when the cock is turned on, the water fills the\r\nspace between the two tubes and slowly filters, under the influence of\r\npressure, through the sides of the porous one, and is freed from all solid\r\nmatter, including the microbes and germs, that it contains. It flows out\r\nthoroughly purified, through the lower aperture, into a vessel placed there\r\nto receive it.\r\n\r\nI have directly ascertained that water thus filtered is deprived of all its\r\ngerms. For this purpose I have added some of it (with the necessary\r\nprecautions against introducing foreign organisms) to very changeable\r\nliquids, such as veal broth, blood, and milk, and have found that there was\r\nno alteration. Such water, then, is incapable of transmitting the germs of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAMBERLAND'S WATER FILTER.]\r\n\r\nWith an apparatus like the one here figured, and in which the filtering\r\ntube is eight inches in length by about one inch in diameter, about four\r\nand a half gallons of water per day may be obtained when the pressure is\r\ntwo atmospheres--the mean pressure in Mr. Pasteur's laboratory, where my\r\nexperiments were made. Naturally, the discharge is greater or less\r\naccording to the pressure. A discharge of three and a half to four and a\r\nhalf gallons of water seems to me to be sufficient for the needs of an\r\nordinary household. For schools, hospitals, barracks, etc., it is easy to\r\nobtain the necessary volume of water by associating the tubes in series.\r\nThe discharge will be multiplied by the number of tubes.\r\n\r\nIn the country, or in towns that have no water mains, it will be easy to\r\ndevise an arrangement for giving the necessary pressure. An increase in the\r\nporosity of the filtering tube is not to be thought of, as this would allow\r\nvery small germs to pass. This filter being a perfect one, we must expect\r\nto see it soil quickly. Filters that do not get foul are just the ones that\r\ndo not filter. But with the arrangement that I have adopted the solid\r\nmatters deposit upon the external surface of the filter, while the inner\r\nsurface always remains perfectly clean. In order to clean the tube, it is\r\nonly necessary to take it out and wash it vigorously. As the tube is\r\nentirely of porcelain, it may likewise be plunged into boiling water so as\r\nto destroy the germs that may have entered the sides or, better yet, it may\r\nbe heated over a gas burner or in an ordinary oven. In this way all the\r\norganic matter will be burned, and the tube will resume its former\r\nporosity.--_M.

No liquid has nearly so wide a\r\nrange of dissolving powers, and, taking things all round, no liquid\r\nexercises so slight an action upon the bodies dissolved--evaporate the\r\nwater away, and the dissolved substance is obtained in an unchanged\r\ncondition; at any rate, this is the general rule.\r\n\r\nThe function of water in nature is essentially that of a solvent or a\r\nmedium of circulation; it is not, in any sense, a food, yet without it no\r\nfood can be assimilated by an animal. Without water the solid materials of\r\nthe globe would be unable to come together so closely as to interchange\r\ntheir elements; and unless the temperatures were sufficiently high to\r\nestablish an igneous fluidity, such as undoubtedly exists in the sun, there\r\nwould be no circulation of matter to speak of, and the earth would be, as\r\nit were, locked up or dead.\r\n\r\nWhen we look upon water as the nearest approach to a universal solvent that\r\neven the astute scientist of to-day has been able to discover, who can\r\nwonder that it is never found absolutely pure in nature? For wherever it\r\naccumulates it dissolves something from its surroundings. Still, in a\r\nrain-drop just formed we have very nearly pure water; but even this\r\ncontains dissolved air to the extent of about one-fiftieth of its volume,\r\nand as the drop falls downward it takes up such impurities as may be\r\nfloating in the atmosphere; so that if our rain-drop is falling\r\nimmediately after a long drought, it becomes charged with nitrate or\r\nnitrite of ammonia and various organic matters--perhaps also the spores or\r\ngerms of disease. Thus it will be seen that rain tends to wonderfully clear\r\nor wash the atmosphere, and we all know how much a first rain is\r\nappreciated as an air purifier, and how it carries down with it valuable\r\nfood for plants. The rain-water, in percolating through or over the land,\r\nflows mainly toward the rivers, and in doing so it becomes more or less\r\ncharged with mineral matter, lime salts and common salt being the chief of\r\nthem; while some of that water which has penetrated more deeply into the\r\nearth takes up far more solid matter than is ordinarily found in river\r\nwater. The bulk of this more or less impure water tends toward the ocean,\r\ntaking with it its load of salt and lime. Constant evaporation, of course,\r\ntakes place from the surface of the sea, so that the salt and lime\r\naccumulate, this latter being, however, ultimately deposited as shells,\r\ncoral, and chalk, while nearly pure or naturally distilled water once more\r\ncondenses in the form of clouds. This process, by which a constant supply\r\nof purified water is kept up in the natural economy, is imitated on a small\r\nscale when water is converted into steam by the action of heat, and this\r\nvapor is cooled so as to reproduce liquid water, the operation in question\r\nbeing known as distillation.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose an apparatus known as a still is required; and although by\r\nlaw one must pay an annual license fee for the right to use a still, it is\r\nnot usual for the government authorities to enforce the law when a still is\r\nmerely used for purifying water.\r\n\r\nOne of the best forms of still for the photographer to employ consists of a\r\ntin can or bottle in which the water is boiled, and to this a tin tube is\r\nadapted by means of a cork, one end of this tin tube terminating in a coil\r\npassing through a tub or other vessel of cold water. A gas burner, as\r\nshown, is a convenient source of heat, and in order to insure a complete\r\ncondensation of the vapor, the water in the cooling tub must be changed now\r\nand again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSometimes the vapor is condensed by being allowed to play against the\r\ninside of a conical cover which is adapted to a saucepan, and is kept cool\r\nby the external application of cold water; and in this case the still takes\r\nthe form represented by the subjoined diagrams; such compact and portable\r\nstills being largely employed in Ireland for the private manufacture of\r\nwhisky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that the condensed water trickles down on\r\nthe inside of the cone, and flows out at the spout.\r\n\r\nAn extemporized arrangement of a similar character may be made by passing a\r\ntobacco pipe through the side of a tin saucepan as shown below, and\r\ninverting the lid of the saucepan; if the lid is now kept cool by frequent\r\nchanges of water inside it, and the pipe is properly adjusted so as to\r\ncatch the drippings from the convex side of the lid, a considerable\r\nquantity of distilled water may be collected in an hour or so.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of solid impurities present in water as ordinarily met with\r\nis extremely variable: rain water which has been collected toward the end\r\nof a storm contains only a minute fraction of a grain per gallon, while\r\nriver or spring water may contain from less than thirty grains per gallon\r\nor so and upward. Ordinary sea water generally contains from three to four\r\nper cent. of saline matter, but that of the Dead Sea contains nearly\r\none-fourth of its weight of salts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe three impurities of water which most interest the photographer are lime\r\nor magnesia salts, which give the so-called hardness; chlorides (as, for\r\nexample, chloride of sodium or common salt), which throw down silver salts;\r\nand organic matter, which may overturn the balance of photographic\r\noperations by causing premature reduction of the sensitive silver\r\ncompounds. To test for them is easy. Hardness is easily recognizable by\r\nwashing one's hands in the water, the soap being curdled; but in many cases\r\none must rather seek for a hard water than avoid it, as the tendency of\r\ngelatine plates to frill is far less in hard water than in soft water. It\r\nis, indeed, a common and useful practice to harden the water used for\r\nwashing by adding half an ounce or an ounce of Epsom salts (sulphate of\r\nmagnesia) to each bucket of water. Chlorides--chloride of sodium or common\r\nsalt being that usually met with--may be detected by adding a drop or two\r\nof nitrate of silver to half a wineglassful of the water, a few drops of\r\nnitric acid being then added. A slight cloudiness indicates a trace of\r\nchlorides, and a decided milkiness shows the presence of a larger quantity.\r\nIf it is wished to get a somewhat more definite idea of the amount, it is\r\neasy to make up a series of standards for comparison, by dissolving known\r\nweights of common salt in distilled or rain water, and testing samples of\r\nthem side by side with the water to be examined.\r\n\r\nOrganic matters may be detected by adding a little nitrate of silver to the\r\nwater, filtering off from any precipitate of chloride of silver, and\r\nexposing the clear liquid to sunlight; a clean stoppered bottle being the\r\nmost convenient vessel to use. The extent to which a blackening takes place\r\nmay be regarded as approximately proportionate to the amount of organic\r\nmatter present.\r\n\r\nFiltration on a small scale is not altogether a satisfactory mode of\r\npurifying water, as organic impurities often accumulate in the filter, and\r\nenter into active putrefaction when hot weather sets in.--_Photo.

Garforth, of Normanton,\r\nhas introduced an ingenious invention, the object of which is to detect\r\nfire-damp in collieries with the least possible degree of risk to those\r\nengaged in the work. Mr. Garforth's invention, which is illustrated in the\r\ndiagram given below, consists in the use of a small India rubber hand ball,\r\nwithout a valve of any description; but by the ordinary action of\r\ncompressing the ball, and then allowing it to expand, a sample of the\r\nsuspected atmosphere is drawn from the roof, or any part of the mine,\r\nwithout the great risk which now attends the operation of testing for gas\r\nshould the gauze of the lamp be defective. The sample thus obtained is then\r\nforced through a small protected tube on to the flame, when if gas is\r\npresent it is shown by the well-known blue cap and elongated flame. From\r\nthis description, and from the fact that the ball is so small that it can\r\nbe carried in the coat pocket, or, if necessary, in the waistcoat pocket,\r\nit will be apparent what a valuable adjunct Mr. Garforth's invention will\r\nprove to the safety-lamp. It has been supposed by some persons that\r\nexplosions have been caused by the fire-trier himself, but owing to his own\r\ndeath in most cases the cause has remained undiscovered. This danger will\r\nnow be altogether avoided. It is well known that the favorite form of lamp\r\nwith the firemen is the Davy, because it shows more readily the presence of\r\nsmall quantities of gas; but the Davy was some years ago condemned, and is\r\nnow strictly prohibited in all Belgian and many English mines. Recent\r\nexperience, gained by repeated experiments with costly apparatus, has\r\nresulted in not only proving the Davy and some other descriptions of lamps\r\nto be unsafe, but some of our Government Inspectors and our most\r\nexperienced mining engineers go so far as to say that \"no lamp in a strong\r\ncurrent of explosive gas is safe unless protected by a tin shield.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf such is the case, Mr. Garforth seems to have struck the key-note when,\r\nin the recent paper read before the Midland Institute of Mining and Civil\r\nEngineers, and which we have now before us, he says: \"It would seem from\r\nthe foregoing remarks that in any existing safety-lamp where one\r\nqualification is increased another is proportionately reduced; so it is\r\ndoubtful whether all the necessary requirements of sensitiveness,\r\nresistance to strong currents, satisfactory light, self-extinction, perfect\r\ncombustion, etc., can ever be combined in one lamp.\"\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to Mr. Garforth's invention which we have ever heard\r\nof is that of a workman at a colliery in the north of England, who, more\r\nthan twenty years ago, to avoid the trouble of getting to the highest part\r\nof the roof, used a kind of air pump, seven or eight feet long, to extract\r\nthe gas from the breaks; and some five years ago Mr. Jones, of Ebbw Vale,\r\nhad a similar idea. It appears that these appliances were so cumbersome,\r\nbesides requiring too great length or height for most mines, and\r\nnecessitating the use of both hands, that they did not come into general\r\nuse. The ideas, however, are totally different, and the causes which have\r\nmost likely led to the invention of the ball and protected tube were\r\nprobably never thought of until recently; indeed, Mr. Garforth writes that\r\nhe has only learned about them since his paper was read before the Midland\r\nInstitute, and some weeks after his patent was taken out.\r\n\r\nNo one, says Mr. Garforth, in his paper read before the Midland Institute,\r\nwill, I presume, deny that the Davy is more sensitive than the tin shield\r\nlamp, inasmuch as in the former the surrounding atmosphere or explosive\r\nmixture has only one thickness of gauze to pass through, and that on a\r\nlevel with the flame; while the latter has a number of small holes and two\r\nor three thicknesses of gauze (according to the construction of the lamp),\r\nwhich the gas must penetrate before it reaches the flame. Moreover, the tin\r\nshield lamp, when inclined to one side, is extinguished (though not so\r\neasily as the Mueseler); and as the inlet holes are 6 inches from the top,\r\nit does not show a thin stratum of fire-damp near the roof as perceptibly\r\nas the Davy, which admits of being put in almost a horizontal position.\r\nAlthough the Davy lamp was, nearly fifty years ago, pronounced unsafe, by\r\nreason of its inability to resist an ordinary velocity of eight feet per\r\nsecond, yet it is still kept in use on account of its sensitiveness. Its\r\nadvocates maintain that a mine can be kept safer by using the Davy, which\r\ndetects small quantities of gas, and thereby shows the real state of the\r\nmine, than by a lamp which, though able to resist a greater velocity, is\r\nnot so sensitive, and consequently is apt to deceive. Assuming the Davy\r\nlamp to be condemned (as it has already been in Belgium and in some English\r\nmines), the Stephenson and some of the more recently invented lamps\r\npronounced unsafe, then if greater shielding is recommended the question\r\nis, what means have we for detecting small quantities of fire-damp?\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the foregoing remarks that in any existing safety-lamp,\r\nwhere one qualification is increased another is proportionately reduced; so\r\nit is doubtful whether all the necessary requirements of sensitiveness,\r\nresistance to strong currents, satisfactory light, self-extinction, perfect\r\ncombustion, etc., can ever be combined in one lamp. The object of the\r\npresent paper is to show that with the assistance of the fire-damp\r\ndetecter, the tin shield, or any other description of lamp, is made as\r\nsensitive as the Davy, while its other advantages of resisting velocity,\r\netc., are not in any way interfered with. As a proof of this I may mention\r\nthat a deputy of experience recently visited a working place to make his\r\ninspection. He reported the stall to be free from gas, but when the manager\r\nand steward visited it with the detecter, which they applied to the roof\r\n(where it would have been difficult to put even a small Davy), it drew a\r\nsample of the atmosphere which, on being put to the test tube in the\r\ntin-shield lamp, at once showed the presence of fire-damp. Out of\r\ntwenty-eight tests in a mine working a long-wall face the Davy showed gas\r\nonly eleven times, while the detecter showed it in every case. The\r\ndetecter, as will be perceived from the one exhibited, and the accompanying\r\nsectional drawing, consists simply of an oval-shaped India rubber ball,\r\nfitted with a mouthpiece. The diameter is about 2¼ inches by 3 inches, its\r\nweight is two ounces, and it is so small that it can be carried without any\r\ninconvenience in the coat or even in the waistcoat pocket. Its capacity is\r\nsuch that all the air within it may be expelled by the compression of one\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe mouthpiece is made to fit a tube in the bottom of the lamp, and when\r\npressed against the India rubber ring on the ball-flange, a perfectly tight\r\njoint is made, which prevents the admission of any external air. The tube\r\nin the bottom of the lamp is carried within a short distance of the height\r\nof the wick-holder. It is covered at the upper end with gauze, besides\r\nbeing fitted with other thicknesses of gauze at certain distances within\r\nthe tube; and if it be found desirable to further protect the flame against\r\nstrong currents of air, a small valve may be placed at the inlet, as shown\r\nin the drawing. This valve is made of sufficient weight to resist the force\r\nof a strong current, and is only lifted from its seat by the pressure of\r\nthe hand on the mouthpiece. It will be apparent from the small size and\r\nelasticity of the detecter that the test can easily be made with one hand,\r\nand when the ball is allowed to expand a vacuum is formed within it, and a\r\nsample of the atmosphere drawn from the breaks, cavities, or highest parts\r\nof the roof, or, of course, any portion of the mine. When the sample is\r\nforced through the tube near the flame, gas if present at once reveals\r\nitself by the elongation of the flame in the usual way, at the same time\r\ngiving an additional proof by burning with a blue flame on the top of the\r\ntest tube. If gas is not present, the distinction is easily seen by the\r\nflame keeping the same size, but burning with somewhat greater brightness,\r\nowing to the increased quality of oxygen forced upon it.\r\n\r\nI venture to claim for this method of detecting fire-damp among other\r\nadvantages: 1. The detecter, on account of its size, can be placed in a\r\nbreak in the roof where an ordinary lamp--even a small Davy--could not be\r\nput, and a purer sample of the suspected atmosphere is obtained than would\r\nbe the case even a few inches below the level of the roof, 2. The obtaining\r\nand testing of a sample in the manner above described takes away the\r\npossibility of an explosion, which might be the result if a lamp with a\r\ndefective gauze were placed in an explosive atmosphere. No one knows how\r\nmany explosions have not been caused by the fire-trier himself. This will\r\nnow be avoided. (Although lamps fitted with a tin shield will be subjected\r\nto the same strict examination as hitherto, still they do not admit of the\r\nsame frequent inspection as those without shields, for in the latter case\r\neach workman can examine his own lamp as an extra precaution; whereas the\r\nexamination of the tin shield lamps will rest entirely with the lamp man.)\r\n3. The lamp can be kept in a pure atmosphere while the sample is obtained\r\nby the detecter, and at a greater height than the flame in a safety-lamp\r\ncould be properly distinguished. The test can afterward be made in a safe\r\nplace, at some distance from the explosive atmosphere; and, owing to the\r\nvacuum formed, the ball (without closing the mouthpiece) has been carried a\r\nmile or more without the gas escaping. 4. The detecter supplies a better\r\nknowledge of the condition of the working places, especially in breaks and\r\ncavities in the roof; which latter, with the help of a nozzle and staff,\r\nmay be reached to a height of ten feet or more, by the detecter being\r\npressed against the roof and sides, or by the use of a special form of\r\ndetecter. 5. Being able at will to force the contents of the detecter on to\r\nthe flame, the effects of an explosion inside the lamp need not be feared.\r\n(This danger being removed, admits, I think, of the glass cylinder being\r\nmade of a larger diameter, whereby a better light is obtained; it may also\r\nbe considered quite as strong, when used with the detecter, as a lamp with\r\na small diameter, when the latter is placed in an explosive atmosphere.) 6.\r\nThe use of the detecter will permit the further protection of the present\r\ntin shield lamp, by an extra thickness of gauze, if such addition is found\r\nadvantageous in resisting an increased velocity. 7. In the Mueseler,\r\nStephenson, and other lamps, where the flame is surrounded by glass, there\r\nis no means of using the wire for shot firing. The detecter tube, although\r\nprotected by two thicknesses of gauze, admits of this being done by the use\r\nof a special form of valve turned by the mouthpiece of the detecter. The\r\nsystem of firing shots or using open lamps in the same pit where safety\r\nlamps are used is exceedingly objectionable; still, under certain\r\nconditions shots may be fired without danger. Whether safety lamps or\r\ncandles are used, it is thought the use of the detecter will afford such a\r\nready means of testing that more examinations will be made before firing a\r\nshot, thereby insuring greater safety. 8. In testing for gas with a safety\r\nlamp there is a fear of the light being extinguished, when the lamp is\r\nsuddenly placed in a quantity of gas, or in endeavoring to get a very\r\nsmall light; this is especially the case with some kinds of lamps. With the\r\ndetecter this is avoided, as a large flame can be used, which is considered\r\nby some a preferable means of testing for small quantities; and the test\r\ncan be made without risk. Where gas is present in large quantities, the\r\nblue flame at the end of the test tube will be found a further proof. This\r\nlatter result is produced by the slightest compression of the ball. (I need\r\nnot point out the inconvenience and loss of time in having to travel a mile\r\nor more to relight.) As regards the use of the detecter with open lights,\r\nseveral of the foregoing advantages or modifications of them will apply.\r\nInstead of having to use the safety lamp as at present, it is thought that\r\nthe working place will be more frequently examined, for a sample of the\r\nsuspected atmosphere can be carried to a safe place and forced on to the\r\nnaked light, when, if gas be present, it simply burns at the end of the\r\nmouthpiece like an ordinary gas jet. There are other advantages, such as\r\nexamining the return airways without exposing the lamp, etc., which will be\r\napparent, and become of more or less importance according to the conditions\r\nunder which the tests are made.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to paint out that the practice adopted at some\r\ncollieries, of having all the men supplied with the most approved lamp\r\n(such as the Mueseler or tin shield lamp) is not a safe one. If the\r\nstrength of a chain is only equal to the weakest link, it may be argued\r\nthat the safety of a mine is only equal to that of the most careless man or\r\nmost unsafe lamp in it. If, therefore, the deputies, whose duty it is to\r\nlook for gas and travel the most dangerous parts of the mine, are obliged\r\nto use the Davy on account of its sensitiveness, may it not be said that,\r\nas their lamps are exposed equally with the workmen's to the high\r\nvelocities of air, they are the weak links in the safety of the mine? For\r\nthe reasons given, I venture to submit that the difficulties and dangers I\r\nhave mentioned will be largely reduced, if not wholly overcome, by the use\r\nof the fire-damp detecter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMERA ATTACHMENT FOR PAPER PHOTO NEGATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn computing the weight of the various items for a photographic tour, the\r\nglass almost invariably comes out at the head of the list, and the farther\r\nor longer the journey, so much more does the weight of the plates stand out\r\npre-eminent; indeed, if one goes out on a trip with only three dozen\r\nhalf-plates, the glass will probably weigh nearly as much as camera, backs,\r\nand tripod, in spite of the stipulation with the maker to supply plates on\r\n\"thin glass.\"\r\n\r\nNext in importance to glass as a support comes paper, and it is quite easy\r\nto understand that the tourist in out of the way parts might be able to\r\ntake an apparatus containing a roll of sensitive paper, when it would be\r\naltogether impracticable for him to take an equivalent surface of coated\r\nglass, and in such a case the roller slide becomes of especial value.\r\n\r\nThe roller slide of Melhuish is tolerably well known, and is, we believe,\r\nnow obtainable as an article of commerce. The slide is fitted up with two\r\nrollers, _a a_, and the sensitive sheets, _b b_, are gummed together,\r\nmaking one long band, the ends of which are gummed to pieces of paper\r\nalways kept on the rollers. The sensitive sheets are wound off the left or\r\nreserve roller on to the right or exposed roller, until all are exposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe rollers are supported on springs, _a¹ a¹_, to render their motion\r\nequal; they are turned by the milled heads, _m m_, and clamped when each\r\nfresh sheet is brought into position by the nuts, _a² a²_. _c_, is a board\r\nwhich is pressed forward by springs, _c¹ c¹_, so as to hold the sheet to be\r\nexposed, and keep it smooth against the plate of glass, _d_; when the sheet\r\nhas been exposed, the board is drawn back from the glass in order to\r\nrelease the exposed sheet, and allow it to be rolled on the exposed roller;\r\nthe board is kept back while this is being done by turning the square rod,\r\n_c²_, half round, so that the angles of the square will not pass back\r\nthrough the square opening until again turned opposite to it; _e e_ are\r\ndoors, by opening which the operator can see (through the yellow glass, _y\r\ny_) to adjust the position of the sensitive sheets when changing them.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable similarity of such a slide to the automatic printing-frame\r\ndescribed last week will strike the reader; and, like the printing-frame,\r\nit possesses the advantage of speed in working--no small consideration to\r\nthe photographer in a distant, and possibly hostile, country.\r\n\r\nFine paper well sized with an insoluble size and coated with a sensitive\r\nemulsion is, we believe, the very best material to use in the roller slide;\r\nand such a paper might be made in long lengths at a very low price, a\r\ncoating machine similar to that constructed for use in making carbon tissue\r\nbeing employed. We have used such paper with success, and hope that some\r\nmanufacturer will introduce it into commerce before long. But the question\r\nsuggests itself, how are the paper negatives to be rendered transparent,\r\nand how is the grain of the paper to be obliterated? Simply by pressure, as\r\nextremely heavy rolling will render such paper almost as transparent as\r\nglass, a fact abundantly demonstrated by Mr. Woodbury in his experiments on\r\nthe Photo-Filigrane process, and confirmed by some trials which we have\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that roller slide experiments which we have made with\r\nsensitive films supported on gelatine sheets, or on such composite sheets\r\nas the alternate rubber and collodion pellicle of Mr. Warnerke, have been\r\nhardly satisfactory--possibly, however, from our own want of skill; while\r\nno form of the Calotype process which we have tried has proved so\r\nsatisfactory as gelatino-bromide paper.--_Photo.

Braun, of Angoulême, has presented to the Photo\r\nSociety of France a new instantaneous shutter. The shutter is formed by a\r\nrevolving metallic disk out of which a segment has been taken. This disk is\r\nplaced in the center of the diaphragms, in order to obtain the greatest\r\nrapidity combined with the least possible distance to travel. On the axis\r\nto which this circular disk is fixed is a small wheel, to which is attached\r\na piece of string, and when the disk is turned round for the exposure the\r\nstring is wound round the wheel. If the string be pulled, naturally the\r\ndisk will revolve back to its former position so much the more quickly the\r\nmore violently the string is pulled. M. Braun has replaced the hand by a\r\nsteel spring attached to the drum of the lens (Fig. 2) By shortening or\r\nlengthening the string, more or less rapid exposures may be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AAA, lens; B, aperture of lens; C, metallic disk; D,\r\nwheel on the axis; E, cord or string; E¹E¹E¹E¹, knots in string; G, steel\r\nspring; H, catch; K, socket for catch.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHUROUS ACID.--EASY METHOD OF PREPARATION FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC PURPOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a short period sulphurous acid has become an important element in\r\nthe preparation of an excellent pyro developer for gelatine plates; and as\r\nit is more or less unstable in its keeping qualities, some easy method of\r\npreparing a small quantity which shall have a uniform strength is\r\ndesirable. A method recently described in the _Photographic News_ will\r\nafford the amateur photographer a ready way of preparing a small quantity\r\nof the acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the illustration given above, A and B are two bottles, both of which can\r\nbe closed tightly with corks. A hole is made in the cork in the bottle, A,\r\na little smaller than the glass tube which connects A and B. It is filed\r\nout with a rat-tail file until it is large enough to admit the tube very\r\ntightly. The tube may be bent easily, by being heated over a common\r\nfish-tail gas burner or over the top of the chimney of a kerosene lamp, so\r\nas to form two right angles, one end extending close to the bottom of the\r\nbottle B as shown.\r\n\r\nHaving fitted up the apparatus, about two ounces of hyposulphite of soda\r\nare placed in the bottle A, while the bottle B is about three-fourths\r\nfilled with water--distilled or melted ice water is to be preferred; some\r\nsulphuric acid--about two ounces--is now diluted with about twice its bulk\r\nof water, by first putting the water into a dish and pouring in the acid in\r\na steady stream, stirring meanwhile. It is well to set the dish in a sink,\r\nto avoid any damage which might occur through the breaking of the dish by\r\nthe heat produced; when cool, the solution is ready for use and may be kept\r\nin a bottle.\r\n\r\nThe cork which serves to adapt the bent tube to the bottle A is now just\r\nremoved for an instant, the other end remaining in the water in bottle B,\r\nand about two or three ounces of the dilute acid are poured in upon the\r\nhyposulphite, after which the cork is immediately replaced.\r\n\r\nSulphurous acid is now evolved by the action of the acid on the hypo, and\r\nas the gas is generated it is led as a series of bubbles through the water\r\nin the bottle B as shown. The air space above the water in bottle B soon\r\nbecomes filled by displacement with sulphurous acid gas, which is a little\r\nover twice as heavy as air; so in order to expedite the complete saturation\r\nof the water, it is convenient to remove the bottle A with its tube from\r\nbottle B, and after having closed the latter by its cork or stopper, to\r\nagitate it thoroughly by turning the bottle upside down. As the sulphurous\r\nacid gas accumulated in the air space over the water is absorbed by the\r\nwater, a partial vacuum is created, and when the stopper is eased an inrush\r\nof air may be noted. When, after passing fresh gas through the liquid for\r\nsome minutes, no further inrush of air is noted on easing the stopper as\r\nbefore described after agitating the bottle, it may be concluded that the\r\nwater is thoroughly saturated with sulphurous acid and is strong enough for\r\nimmediate use. More gas can be generated by adding more dilute sulphuric\r\nacid to the hypo until the latter is decomposed; then it should be thrown\r\naside, and a fresh charge put in the bottle. On preparing the solution it\r\nis well to set the bottles on the outside ledge of the window, or in some\r\nother open situation where no inconvenience will result from the escape of\r\nthe excess of sulphurous gas as it bubbles through the water.\r\n\r\nThe solution of sulphurous acid, if preserved at all, ought to be kept in\r\nsmall bottles, completely filled and perfectly closed; but as it is very\r\neasy to saturate a considerable quantity of water with sulphurous acid gas\r\nin a short time, there is but little inducement to use a solution which may\r\npossibly have become weakened by keeping.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken not to add too much dilute acid to the hypo at a time,\r\nelse excessive effervescence will occur, and the solution will froth over\r\nthe top of the bottle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL MONUMENT AT ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout three years ago the Italian Government invited the architects and\r\nartists of the world to furnish competitive designs for a national monument\r\nto be erected to the memory of King Victor Emanuel II. at Rome. More than\r\n$1,800,000 were appropriated for the monument exclusive of the foundation.\r\nIt is very seldom that an artist has occasion to carry out as grand and\r\ninteresting a work as this was to be: the representation of the creator of\r\nthe Italian union in the new capitol of the new state surrounded by the\r\nruins and mementos of a proud and mighty past. Prizes of $10,000, $6,000,\r\nand $4,000 were donated for the first, second, and third prize designs\r\nrespectively. Designs were entered, not only from Italy, but also from\r\nGermany, France, Norway, Sweden, England, and America, and even from\r\nCaucasus and Japan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNION OF ITALY. SACCONI'S PRIZE DESIGN FOR THE\r\nNATIONAL MONUMENT, ROME, ITALY.]\r\n\r\nThe height and size of the monument were not determined on, nor was the\r\nexact location, and the competitors had full liberty in relation to the\r\nartistic character of the monument, and it was left for them to decide\r\nwhether it should be a triumphal arch, a column, a temple, a mausoleum, or\r\nany other elaborate design. This great liberty given to the competitors was\r\nof great value and service to the monument commission, as it enabled them\r\nto decide readily what the character of the monument should be but it was a\r\ndangerous point for the artists, at which most of them foundered. The\r\ncompetition was resultless. Two prizes were given, but new designs had to\r\nbe called for, which were governed more or less by a certain programme\r\nissued by the committee.\r\n\r\nIn place of the Piazza de Termini, a square extending from the church of\r\nSt. Maria degli Angeli to the new Via Nazionale, to which preference was\r\ngiven by the competitors, the heights of Aracoeli were chosen. The monument\r\nwas to be erected at this historic place in front of the side wall of the\r\nchurch, with the center toward the Corso, high above the surrounding\r\nbuildings. The programme called for an equestrian statue of the King\r\nlocated in front of an architectural background which was to cover the old\r\nchurch walls, and was to be reached by a grand staircase.\r\n\r\nEven the result of this second competition was not definite, but as the\r\ndesigners were guided by the programme, the results obtained were much more\r\nsatisfactory. The commission decided not to award the first prize, but\r\nhonored the Italian architects Giuseppi Sacconi and Manfredo Manfredi, and\r\nthe German Bruno Schmitz, with a prize of $2,000 each; and requested them\r\nto enter into another competition and deliver their models within four\r\nmonths, so as to enable the commission to come to a final decision. On June\r\n18, the commission decided to accept Sacconi's design for execution, and\r\nawarded a second prize of $2,000 to Manfredi.\r\n\r\nSacconi's design, shown opposite page, cut taken from the _Illustrirte\r\nZeitung_, needs but little explanation. An elegant gallery of sixteen\r\nCorinthian columns on a high, prominent base is crowned by a high attica\r\nand flanked by pavilions. It forms the architectural background for the\r\nequestrian statue, and is reached by an elaborately ornamented staircase.\r\n\r\nManfredi's design shows a handsomely decorated wall in place of the\r\ngallery, and in front of the wall an amphitheater is arranged, in the\r\ncenter of which the equestrian statue is placed. Bruno Schmitz' design\r\nshows a rich mosaic base supporting an Ionic portico, from the middle of\r\nwhich a six column Corinthian \"pronaos\" projects, which no doubt would have\r\nproduced a magnificent effect in the streets of Rome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE EVOLUTION OF FORMS OF ORNAMENT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a paper by Prof. Jacobsthal in the _Transactions_ of the\r\nArchæological Society of Berlin.--_Nature_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statement that modern culture can be understood only through a study of\r\nall its stages of development is equally true of its several branches.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that decorative art is one of these. It contains in itself,\r\nlike language and writing, elements of ancient and even of prehistoric\r\nforms, but it must, like these other expressions of culture, which are\r\nforever undergoing changes, adapt itself to the new demands which are made\r\nupon it, not excepting the very arbitrary ones of fashion; and it is owing\r\nto this cause that, sometimes even in the early stages of its development,\r\nlittle or nothing of its original form is recognizable. Investigations the\r\nobject of which is to clear up this process of development as far as\r\npossible are likely to be of some service; a person is more likely to\r\nrecognize the beauties in the details of ornamental works of art if he has\r\nan acquaintance with the leading styles, and the artist who is freed from\r\nthe bondage of absolute tradition will be put into a better position to\r\ndiscriminate between accidental and arbitrary and organic and legitimate\r\nforms, and will thus have his work in the creation of new ones made more\r\neasy for him.\r\n\r\nHence I venture to claim some measure of indulgence in communicating the\r\nresults of the following somewhat theoretical investigations, as they are\r\nnot altogether without a practical importance. I must ask the reader to\r\nfollow me into a modern drawing-room, not into one that will dazzle us with\r\nits cold elegance, but into one whose comfort invites us to remain in it.\r\n\r\nThe simple stucco ceiling presents a central rosette, which passes over by\r\nlight conventional floral forms into the general pattern of the ceiling.\r\nThe frieze also, which is made of the same material, presents a similar but\r\nsomewhat more compact floral pattern as its chief motive. Neither of these,\r\nthough they belong to an old and never extinct species, has as yet attained\r\nthe dignity of a special name.\r\n\r\nThe walls are covered with a paper the ornamentation of which is based upon\r\nthe designs of the splendid textile fabrics of the middle ages, and\r\nrepresents a floral pattern of spirals and climbing plants, and bears\r\nevident traces of the influence of Eastern culture. It is called a\r\npomegranate or pine-apple pattern, although in this case neither\r\npomegranates nor pine-apples are recognizable.\r\n\r\nSimilarly with respect to the pattern of the coverings of the chairs and\r\nsofas and of the stove-tiles; these, however, show the influence of Eastern\r\nculture more distinctly.\r\n\r\nThe carpet also, which is not a true Oriental one, fails to rivet the\r\nattention, but gives a quiet satisfaction to the eye, which, as it were,\r\ncasually glances over it, by its simple pattern, which is derived from\r\nPersian-Indian archetypes (Cashmere pattern, Indian palmettas), and which\r\nis ever rhythmically repeating itself (see Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe floral pattern on the dressing-gown of the master of the house, as well\r\nas on the light woolen shawl that is thrown round the shoulders of his\r\nwife, and even the brightly colored glass knicknacks on the mantel-piece,\r\nmanufactured in Silesia after the Indian patterns of the Reuleaux\r\ncollection, again show the same motive; in the one case in the more\r\ngeometrical linear arrangement, in the other in the more freely entwined\r\nspirals.\r\n\r\nNow you will perhaps permit me to denominate these three groups of patterns\r\nthat occur in our new home fabrics as modern patterns. Whether we shall in\r\nthe next season be able, in the widest sense of the word, to call these\r\npatterns modern naturally depends on the ruling fashion of the day, which\r\nof course cannot be calculated upon (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nI beg to be allowed to postpone the nearer definition of the forms that\r\noccur in the three groups, which, however, on a closer examination all\r\npresent a good deal that they have in common. Taking them in a general way,\r\nthey all show a leaf-form inclosing an inflorescence in the form of an ear\r\nor thistle; or at other times a fruit or a fruit-form. In the same way with\r\nthe stucco ornaments and the wall-paper pattern.\r\n\r\nThe Cashmere pattern also essentially consists of a leaf with its apex\r\nlaterally expanded; it closes an ear-shaped flower-stem, set with small\r\nflorets, which in exceptional cases protrude beyond the outline of the\r\nleaf; the whole is treated rigorously as an absolute flat ornament, and\r\nhence its recognition is rendered somewhat more difficult. The blank\r\nexpansion of the leaf is not quite unrelieved by ornament, but is set off\r\nwith small points, spots, and blossoms. This will be thought less strange\r\nif we reflect on the Eastern representations of animals, in the portrayal\r\nof which the flat expanses produced by the muscle-layers are often treated\r\nfrom a purely decorative point of view, which strikes us as an exaggeration\r\nof convention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nOne cannot go wrong in taking for granted that plant-forms were the\r\narchetypes of all these patterns. Now we know that it holds good, as a\r\ngeneral principle in the history of civilization, that the tiller of the\r\nground supplants the shepherd, as the shepherd supplants the hunter; and\r\nthe like holds also in the history of the branch of art we are\r\ndiscussing--representations of animals are the first to make their\r\nappearance, and they are at this period remarkable for a wonderful\r\nsharpness of characterization. At a later stage man first begins to exhibit\r\na preference for plant-forms as subjects for representation, and above all\r\nfor such as can in any way be useful or hurtful to him. We, however, meet\r\nsuch plant-forms used in ornament in the oldest extant monuments of art in\r\nEgypt, side by side with representations of animals; but the previous\r\nhistory of this very developed culture is unknown. In such cases as afford\r\nus an opportunity of studying more primitive though not equally ancient\r\nstages of culture, as for instance among the Greeks, we find the above\r\ndictum confirmed, at any rate in cases where we have to deal with the\r\nrepresentation of the indigenous flora as contradistinguished from such\r\nrepresentations of plants as were imported from foreign civilizations. In\r\nthe case that is now to occupy us, we have not to go back so very far in\r\nthe history of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe ornamental representations of plants are of two kinds. Where we have to\r\ndeal with a simple pictorial reproduction of plants as symbols (laurel\r\nbranches, boughs of olive and fir, and branches of ivy), _i. e._, with a\r\nmere characteristic decoration of a technical structure, stress is laid\r\nupon the most faithful reproduction of the object possible--the artist is\r\nagain and again referred to the study of Nature in order to imitate her.\r\nHence, as a general rule, there is less difficulty in the explanation of\r\nthese forms, because even the minute details of the natural object now and\r\nthen offer points that one can fasten upon. It is quite another thing when\r\nwe have to deal with actual decoration which does not aim at anything\r\nfurther than at employing the structural laws of organisms in order to\r\norganize the unwieldy substance, to endow the stone with a higher vitality.\r\nThese latter forms depart, even at the time when they originate, very\r\nconsiderably from the natural objects. The successors of the originators\r\nsoon still further modify them by adapting them to particular purposes,\r\ncombining and fusing them with other forms so as to produce particular\r\nindividual forms which have each their own history (_e.g._, the acanthus\r\nornament, which, in its developed form, differs very greatly from the\r\nacanthus plant itself); and in a wider sense we may here enumerate all such\r\nforms as have been raised by art to the dignity of perfectly viable beings,\r\n_e.g._, griffins, sphinxes, dragons, and angels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe deciphering and derivation of such forms as these is naturally\r\nenough more difficult; in the case of most of them we are not even in\r\npossession of the most necessary preliminaries to the investigation, and\r\nin the case of others there are very important links missing (_e.g._,\r\nfor the well-known Greek palmettas). In proportion as the representation\r\nof the plant was a secondary object, the travesty has been more and more\r\ncomplete. As in the case of language, where the root is hardly\r\nrecognizable in the later word, so in decorative art the original form\r\nis indistinguishable in the ornament. The migration of races and the\r\nearly commercial intercourse between distant lands have done much to\r\nbring about the fusion of types; but again in contrast to this we find,\r\nin the case of extensive tracts of country, notably in the Asiatic\r\ncontinent, a fixity, throughout centuries, of forms that have once been\r\nintroduced, which occasions a confusion between ancient and modern works\r\nof art, and renders investigations much more difficult. An old French\r\ntraveler writes: \"J'ai vu dans le trésor d'Ispahan les vetements de\r\nTamerlan; ils ne different en rien de ceux d'aujourd'hui.\" Ethnology,\r\nthe natural sciences, and last, but not least, the history of technical\r\nart are here set face to face with great problems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nIn the case in point, the study of the first group of artistic forms that\r\nhave been elaborated by Western art leads to definite results, because the\r\nexecution of the forms in stone can be followed on monuments that are\r\nrelatively not very old, that are dated, and of which the remains are still\r\nextant. In order to follow the development, I ask your permission to go\r\nback at once to the very oldest of the known forms. They come down to us\r\nfrom the golden era of Greek decorative art--from the fourth or fifth\r\ncentury B.C.--when the older simple styles of architecture were supplanted\r\nby styles characterized by a greater richness of structure and more\r\ndeveloped ornament. A number of flowers from capitals in Priene, Miletus,\r\nEleusis, Athens (monument of Lysicrates), and Pergamon; also flowers from\r\nthe calathos of a Greek caryatid in the Villa Albani near Rome, upon many\r\nGreek sepulchral wreaths, upon the magnificent gold helmet of a Grecian\r\nwarrior (in the Museum of St. Petersburg)--these show us the simplest type\r\nof the pattern in question, a folded leaf, that has been bulged out,\r\ninclosing a knob or a little blossom (see Figs. 3 and 4). This is an\r\nexample from the Temple of Apollo at Miletus, one that was constructed\r\nabout ten years ago, for educational purposes. Here is the specimen of the\r\nflower of the monument to Lysicrates at Athens, of which the central part\r\nconsists of a small flower or fruits (Figs. 5 and 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe form passes over into Roman art. The larger scale of the buildings,\r\nand the pretensions to a greater richness in details, lead to a further\r\nsplitting up of the leaf into acanthus-like forms. Instead of a fruit-form\r\na fir-cone appears, or a pine-apple or other fruit in an almost\r\nnaturalistic form.\r\n\r\nIn a still larger scale we have the club-shaped knob developing into a\r\nplant-stem branching off something after the fashion of a candelabrum, and\r\nthe lower part of the leaf, where it is folded together in a somewhat\r\nbell-shaped fashion, becomes in the true sense of the word a campanulum,\r\nout of which an absolute vessel-shaped form, as _e.g._ is to be seen in the\r\nfrieze of the Basilica Ulpia in Rome, becomes developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nSuch remains of pictorial representation as are still extant present us\r\nwith an equally perfect series of developments. The splendid Græco-Italian\r\nvessels, the richly ornamented Apulian vases, show flowers in the spirals\r\nof the ornaments, and even in the foreground of the pictorial\r\nrepresentations, which correspond exactly to the above mentioned Greek\r\nrelief representations. [The lecturer sent round, among other\r\nillustrations, a small photograph of a celebrated vase in Naples\r\n(representing the funeral rites of Patroclus), in which the flower in\r\nquestion appears in the foreground, and is perhaps also employed as\r\nornament.] (Figs. 7 and 8.)\r\n\r\nThe Pompeian paintings and mosaics, and the Roman paintings, of which\r\nunfortunately very few specimens have come down to us, show that the\r\nfurther developments of this form were most manifold, and indeed they form\r\nin conjunction with the Roman achievements in plastic art the highest point\r\nthat this form reached in its development, a point that the Renaissance,\r\nwhich followed hard upon it, did not get beyond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nThus the work of Raphael from the loggias follows in unbroken succession\r\nupon the forms from the Thermæ of Titus. It is only afterward that a freer\r\nhandling of the traditional pattern arose, characterized by the\r\nsubstitution of, for instance, maple or whitethorn for the acanthus-like\r\nforms. Often even the central part falls away completely, or is replaced by\r\noverlapping leaves. In the forms of this century we have the same process\r\nrepeated. Schinkel and Botticher began with the Greek form, and have put it\r\nto various uses; Stuler, Strack, Gropius, and others followed in their wake\r\nuntil the more close resemblance to the forms of the period of the\r\nRenaissance in regard to Roman art which characterizes the present day was\r\nattained (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\nNow, what plant suggested this almost indispensable form of ornament, which\r\nranks along with the acanthus and palmetta, and which has also become so\r\nimportant by a certain fusion with the structural laws of both?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nWe meet with organism of the form in the family of the Araceæ, or aroid\r\nplants. An enveloping leaf (bract), called the spathe, which is often\r\nbrilliantly colored, surrounds the florets, or fruits, that are disposed\r\nupon a spadix. Even the older writers--Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Galen,\r\nand Pliny--devote a considerable amount of attention to several species of\r\nthis interesting family, especially to the value of their swollen stems as\r\na food-stuff, to their uses in medicine, etc. Some species of Arum were\r\neaten, and even nowadays the value of the swollen stems of some species of\r\nthe family causes them to be cultivated, as, for instance, in Egypt and\r\nIndia, etc. (the so-called Portland sago, Portland Island arrowroot, is\r\nprepared from the swollen stems of _Arum maculatum_). In contrast with the\r\nsmooth or softly undulating outlines of the spathe of Mediterranean Araceæ,\r\none species stands out in relief, in which the sharply-marked fold of the\r\nspathe almost corresponds to the forms of the ornaments which we are\r\ndiscussing. It is _Dracunculus vulgaris_, and derives its name from its\r\nstem, which is spotted like a snake. This plant, which is pretty widely\r\ndistributed in olive woods and in the river valleys of the countries\r\nbordering on the Mediterranean, was employed to a considerable extent in\r\nmedicine by the ancients (and is so still nowadays, according to Von\r\nHeldreich, in Greece). It was, besides, the object of particular regard,\r\nbecause it was said not only to heal snake-bite, but the mere fact of\r\nhaving it about one was supposed to keep away snakes, who were said\r\naltogether to avoid the places where it grew. But, apart from this, the\r\nstriking appearance of this plant, which often grows to an enormous size,\r\nwould be sufficient to suggest its employment in art. According to\r\nmeasurements of Dr. Julius Schmidt, who is not long since dead, and was the\r\ndirector of the Observatory at Athens, a number of these plants grow in the\r\nValley of Cephisus, and attain a height of as much as two meters, the\r\nspathe alone measuring nearly one meter. [The lecturer here exhibited a\r\ndrawing (natural size) of this species, drawn to the measurements above\r\nreferred to.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nDr. Sintenis, the botanist, who last year traveled through Asia Minor and\r\nGreece, tells me that he saw beautiful specimens of the plant in many\r\nplaces, _e.g._, in Assos, in the neighborhood of the Dardanelles, under the\r\ncypresses of the Turkish cemeteries.\r\n\r\nThe inflorescence corresponds almost exactly to the ornament, but the\r\nmultipartite leaf has also had a particular influence upon its development\r\nand upon that of several collateral forms which I cannot now discuss. The\r\nshape of the leaf accounts for several as yet unexplained extraordinary\r\nforms in the ancient plane-ornament, and in the Renaissance forms that have\r\nbeen thence developed. It first suggested the idea to me of studying the\r\nplant attentively after having had the opportunity five years ago of seeing\r\nthe leaves in the Botanic Gardens at Pisa. It was only afterward that I\r\nsucceeded in growing some flowers which fully confirmed the expectations\r\nthat I had of them (Figs. 10 and 11).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe leaf in dracunculus has a very peculiar shape; it consists of a number\r\nof lobes which are disposed upon a stalk which is more or less forked\r\n(tends more or less to dichotomize). If you call to your minds some of the\r\nPompeian wall decorations, you will perceive that similar forms occur there\r\nin all possible variations. Stems are regularly seen in decorations that\r\nrun perpendicularly, surrounded by leaves of this description. Before this,\r\nthese suggested the idea of a misunderstood (or very conventional)\r\nperspective representation of a circular flower. Now the form also occurs\r\nin this fashion, and thus negatives the idea of a perspective\r\nrepresentation of a closed flower. It is out of this form in combination\r\nwith the flower-form that the series of patterns was developed which we\r\nhave become acquainted with in Roman art, especially in the ornament of\r\nTitus' Thermæ and in the Renaissance period in Raphael's work. [The\r\nlecturer here explained a series of illustrations of the ornaments referred\r\nto (Figs. 12, 13, 14).]\r\n\r\nThe attempt to determine the course of the first group of forms has been to\r\na certain extent successful, but we meet greater difficulties in the study\r\nof the second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to obtain a firm basis on which to conduct our\r\ninvestigations from the historical or geographical point of view into this\r\nform of art, which was introduced into the West by Arabico-Moorish culture,\r\nand which has since been further developed here. There is only one method\r\nopen to us in the determination of the form, which is to pass gradually\r\nfrom the richly developed and strongly differentiated forms to the smaller\r\nand simpler ones, even if these latter should have appeared\r\ncontemporaneously or even later than the former. Here we have again to\r\nrefer to the fact that has already been mentioned, to wit, that Oriental\r\nart remained stationary throughout long periods of time. In point of fact,\r\nthe simpler forms are invariably characterized by a nearer and nearer\r\napproach to the more ancient patterns and also to the natural flower-forms\r\nof the Araceæ. We find the spathe, again, sometimes drawn like an acanthus\r\nleaf, more often, however, bulged out, coming to be more and more of a mere\r\noutline figure, and becoming converted into a sort of background; then the\r\nspadix, generally conical in shape, sometimes, however, altogether replaced\r\nby a perfect thistle, at other times again by a pomegranate. Auberville, in\r\nhis magnificent work \"L'Ornement des Tissus,\" is astonished to find the\r\nterm pomegranate-pattern almost confined to these forms, since their\r\ncentral part is generally formed of a thistle-form. As far as I can\r\ndiscover in the literature that is at my disposal, this question has not\r\nhad any particular attention devoted to it except in the large work upon\r\nOttoman architecture published in Constantinople under the patronage of\r\nEdhem Pasha. The pomegranate that has served as the original of the pattern\r\nin question is in this work surrounded with leaves till it gives some sort\r\nof an approach to the pattern. (There are important suggestions in the book\r\nas to the employment of melon-forms.) Whoever has picked the fruit from the\r\ntender twigs of the pomegranate tree, which are close set with small\r\naltered leaves, will never dream of attributing the derivation of the\r\nthorny leaves that appear in the pattern to pomegranate leaves at any stage\r\nof their development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14]\r\n\r\nIt does not require much penetration to see that the outline of the whole\r\nform corresponds to the spathe of the Araceæ, even although in later times\r\nthe jagged contour is all that has remained of it, and it appears to have\r\nbeen provided with ornamental forms quite independently of the rest of the\r\npattern. The inner thistle-form cannot be derived from the common thistle,\r\nbecause the surrounding leaves negative any such idea. The artichoke theory\r\nalso has not enough in its favor, although the artichoke, as well as the\r\nthistle, was probably at a later time directly pressed into service. Prof.\r\nAscherson first called my attention to the extremely anciently cultivated\r\nplant, the safflor (_Carthamus tinctoris_, Fig. 15), a thistle plant whose\r\nflowers were employed by the ancients as a dye. Some drawings and dried\r\nspecimens, as well as the literature of the subject, first gave me a hope\r\nto find that this plant was the archetype of this ornament, a hope that was\r\nborne out by the study of the actual plant, although I was unable to grow\r\nit to any great perfection.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Egyptian King Sargo (according to Ascherson and\r\nSchweinfurth) this plant was already well known as a plant of cultivation;\r\nin a wild state it is not known (De Candolle, \"Originel des Plantes\r\ncultivées\"). In Asia its cultivation stretches to Japan. Semper cites a\r\npassage from an Indian drama to the effect that over the doorway there was\r\nstretched an arch of ivory, and about it were bannerets on which wild\r\nsafran (_Saflor_) was painted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15]\r\n\r\nThe importance of the plant as a dye began steadily to decrease, and it has\r\nnow ceased to have any value as such in the face of the introduction of\r\nnewer coloring matters (a question that was treated of in a paper read a\r\nshort time ago by Dr. Reimann before this Society). Perhaps its only use\r\nnowadays is in the preparation of rouge (_rouge végétale_).\r\n\r\nBut at a time when dyeing, spinning, and weaving were, if not in the one\r\nhand, yet at any rate intimately connected with one another in the narrow\r\ncircle of a home industry, the appearance of this beautiful gold-yellow\r\nplant, heaped up in large masses, would be very likely to suggest its\r\nimmortalization in textile art, because the drawing is very faithful to\r\nnature in regard to the thorny involucre. Drawings from nature of the plant\r\nin the old botanical works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries look\r\nvery like ornamental patterns. Now after the general form had been\r\nintroduced, pomegranates or other fruits--for instance, pine-apples--were\r\nintroduced within the nest of leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nInto the detailed study of the intricacies of this subject I cannot here\r\nenter; the East-Asian influences are not to be neglected, which had\r\nprobably even in early times an effect upon the form that was assumed, and\r\nhave fused the correct style of compound flowers for flat ornament with the\r\nabove-mentioned forms, so as to produce peculiar patterns; we meet them\r\noften in the so-called Persian textures and flat ornaments (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\nWe now come to the third group of forms--the so-called Cashmere pattern, or\r\nIndian palmetta. The developed forms, which, when they have attained their\r\nhighest development, often show us outlines that are merely fanciful, and\r\nrepresent quite a bouquet of flowers leaning over to one side, and\r\nspringing from a vessel (the whole corresponding to the Roman form with the\r\nvessel), must be thrown to one side, while we follow up the simpler forms,\r\nbecause in this case also we have no information as to either the where or\r\nthe when the forms originated. (Figs. 17, 18, 19.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nHere again we are struck by resemblances to the forms that were the\r\nsubjects of our previous study, we even come across direct transitional\r\nforms, which differ from the others only by the lateral curve of the apex\r\nof the leaf; sometimes it is the central part, the spadix, that is bent\r\noutward, and the very details show a striking agreement with the structure\r\nof the aroid inflorescence, so much so that one might regard them as\r\nactually copied from them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nThis form of ornament has been introduced into Europe since the French\r\nexpedition to Egypt, owing to the importation of genuine Cashmere shawls.\r\n(When it cropped up in isolated forms, as in Venice in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, it appears not to have exerted any influence; its introduction is\r\nperhaps rather to be attributed to calico-printing.) Soon afterward the\r\nEuropean shawl-manufacture, which is still in a flourishing state, was\r\nintroduced. Falcot informs us that designs of a celebrated French artist,\r\nCouder, for shawl-patterns, a subject that he studied in India itself, were\r\nexported back to that country and used there (Fig. 20).\r\n\r\nIn these shawl-patterns the original simple form meets us in a highly\r\ndeveloped, magnificent, and splendidly colored differentiation and\r\nelaboration. This we can have no scruples in ranking along with the\r\nmediæval plane-patterns, which we have referred to above, among the highest\r\nachievements of decorative art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it, at any rate in this high stage of development,\r\nresisted fusion with Western forms of art. It is all the more incumbent\r\nupon us to investigate the laws of its existence, in order to make it less\r\nalien to us, or perhaps to assimilate it to ourselves by attaining to an\r\nunderstanding of those laws. A great step has been made when criticism has,\r\nby a more painstaking study, put itself into a position to characterize as\r\nworthless ignorantly imitated, or even original, miscreations such as are\r\neternally cropping up. If we look at our modern manufactures immediately\r\nafter studying patterns which enchant us with their classical repose, or\r\nafter it such others as captivate the eye by their beautiful coloring, or\r\nthe elaborative working out of their details, we recognize that the\r\nbeautifully balanced form is often cut up, choked over with others, or\r\nmangled (the flower springing up side down from the leaves), the whole\r\nbeing traversed at random by spirals, which are utterly foreign to the\r\nspirit of such a style, and all this at the caprice of uncultured, boorish\r\ndesigners. Once we see that the original of the form was a plant, we shall\r\never in the developed, artistic form cling, in a general way at least, to\r\nthe laws of its organization, and we shall at any rate be in a position to\r\navoid violent incongruities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nI had resort, a few years ago, to the young botanist Ruhmer, assistant at\r\nthe Botanical Museum at Schöneberg, who has unfortunately since died of\r\nsome chest-disease, in order to get some sort of a groundwork for direct\r\ninvestigations. I asked him to look up the literature of the subject, with\r\nrespect to the employment of the Indian Araceæ for domestic uses or in\r\nmedicine. A detailed work on the subject was produced, and establishes\r\nthat, quite irrespective of species of Alocasia and Colocasia that have\r\nbeen referred to, a large number of Araceæ were employed for all sorts of\r\ndomestic purposes. Scindapsus, which was used as a medicine, has actually\r\nretained a Sanskrit name, \"vustiva.\" I cannot here go further into the\r\ndetails of this investigation, but must remark that even the incomplete and\r\nimperfect drawings of these plants, which, owing to the difficulty of\r\npreserving them, are so difficult to collect through travelers, exhibit\r\nsuch a wealth of shape, that it is quite natural that Indian and Persian\r\nflower-loving artists should be quite taken with them, and employ them\r\nenthusiastically in decorative art. Let me also mention that Haeckel, in\r\nhis '\"Letters of an Indian Traveler,\" very often bears witness to the\r\neffect of the Araceæ upon the general appearance of the vegetation, both in\r\nthe full and enormous development of species of Caladia and in the species\r\nof Pothos which form such impenetrable mazes of interlooping stems.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to remark that the results of my investigation, of\r\nwhich but a succinct account has been given here, negative certain\r\nderivations, which have been believed in, though they have never been\r\nproved; such as that of the form I have last discussed from the Assyrian\r\npalmetta, or from a cypress bent down by the wind. To say the least the\r\nlaws of formation here laid down have a more intimate connection with the\r\nforms as they have come down to us, and give us a better handle for future\r\nuse and development. The object of the investigation was, in general words,\r\nto prepare for an explanation of the questions raised; and even if the\r\nresults had turned out other than they have, it would have sufficed me to\r\nhave given an impulse to labors which will testify to the truth of the dead\r\nmaster's words:\r\n\r\n    \"Was Du ererbt von deinen Vätern hast,\r\n    Erwirb es, um es zu besitzen.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS TOWARD A KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Meeting of the British Association, Montreal. 1884. Section A.\r\nMathematical and Physical science. Opening Address by Prof. Sir William\r\nThomson, M.A., LL.D., D.C.L., F.R.SS.L. and E., F.R.A.S., President of the\r\nSection.]\r\n\r\nBy Sir WILLIAM THOMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe now well known kinetic theory of gases is a step so important in the\r\nway of explaining seemingly static properties of matter by motion, that it\r\nis scarcely possible to help anticipating in idea the arrival at a complete\r\ntheory of matter, in which all its properties will be seen to be merely\r\nattributes of motion. If we are to look for the origin of this idea we must\r\ngo back to Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius. We may then, I believe,\r\nwithout missing a single step, skip 1800 years. Early last century we find\r\nin Malebranche's \"Recherche de la Verite,\" the statement that \"la durete de\r\ncorps\" depends on \"petits tourbillons.\" [1] These words, embedded in a\r\nhopeless mass of unintelligible statements of the physical, metaphysical,\r\nand theological philosophies of the day, and unsupported by any\r\nexplanation, elucidation, or illustration throughout the rest of the three\r\nvolumes, and only marred by any other single sentence or word to be found\r\nin the great book, still do express a distinct conception which forms a\r\nmost remarkable step toward the kinetic theory of matter. A little later we\r\nhave Daniel Bernoulli's promulgation of what we now accept as a surest\r\narticle of scientific faith--the kinetic theory of gases. He, so far as I\r\nknow, thought only of Boyle's and Mariotte's law of the \"spring of air,\" as\r\nBoyle called it, without reference to change of temperature or the\r\naugmentation of its pressure if not allowed to expand for elevation of\r\ntemperature, a phenomenon which perhaps he scarcely knew, still less the\r\nelevation of temperature produced by compression, and the lowering of\r\ntemperature by dilatation, and the consequent necessity of waiting for a\r\nfraction of a second or a few seconds of time (with apparatus of ordinary\r\nexperimental magnitude), to see a subsidence from a larger change of\r\npressure down to the amount of change that verifies Boyle's law. The\r\nconsideration of these phenomena forty years ago by Joule, in connection\r\nwith Bernoulli's original conception, formed the foundation of the kinetic\r\ntheory of gases as we now have it. But what a splendid and useful building\r\nhas been placed on this foundation by Clausius and Maxwell, and what a\r\nbeautiful ornament we see on the top of it in the radiometer of Crookes,\r\nsecurely attached to it by the happy discovery of Tait and Dewar,[2] that\r\nthe length of the free path of the residual molecules of air in a good\r\nmodern vacuum may amount to several inches! Clausius' and Maxwell's\r\nexplanations of the diffusion of gases, and of thermal conduction in gases,\r\ntheir charmingly intelligible conclusion that in gases the diffusion of\r\nheat is just a little more rapid than the diffusion of molecules, because\r\nof the interchange of energy in collisions between molecules,[3] while the\r\nchief transference of heat is by actual transport of the molecules\r\nthemselves, and Maxwell's explanation of the viscosity of gases, with the\r\nabsolute numerical relations which the work of those two great discoverers\r\nfound among the three properties of diffusion, thermal conduction, and\r\nviscosity, have annexed to the domain of science a vast and ever growing\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Preuve de la supposition que j'ay faite: Que la matiere\r\nsubtile ou etheree est necessairement composee de PETITS TOURBILLONS; et\r\nqu'ils sont les causes naturelles de tous les changements qui arrivent a la\r\nmatiere; ce que je confirme par i'explication des effets les plus generaux\r\nde la Physique, tels que sont la durete des corps, leur fluidite, leur\r\npesanteur, legerete, la lumiere et la refraction et reflexion de ses\r\nrayons.\"--Malebranche, \"Recherche de la Verite,\" 1712.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Proc. R.S.E., March 2, 1874, and July 5, 1875.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: On the other hand, in liquids, on account of the crowdedness\r\nof the molecules, the diffusion of heat must be chiefly by interchange of\r\nenergies between the molecules, and should be, as experiment proves it is,\r\nenormously more rapid than the diffusion of the molecules themselves, and\r\nthis again ought to be much less rapid than either the material or thermal\r\ndiffusivities of gases. Thus the diffusivity of common salt through water\r\nwas found by Fick to be as small as 0.0000112 square centimeter per second;\r\nnearly 200 times as great as this is the diffusivity of heat through water,\r\nwhich was found by J.T. Bottomley to be about 0.002 square centimeter per\r\nsecond. The material diffusivities of gases, according to Loschmidt's\r\nexperiments, range from 0.98 (the interdiffusivity of carbonic acid and\r\nnitrous oxide) to 0.642 (the interdiffusivity of carbonic oxide and\r\nhydrogen), while the thermal diffusivities of gases, calculated according\r\nto Clausius' and Maxwell's kinetic theory of gases, are 0.089 for carbonic\r\nacid, 0.16 for common air of other gases of nearly the same density, and\r\n1.12 for hydrogen (all, both material and thermal, being reckoned in square\r\ncentimeters per second).]\r\n\r\nRich as it is in practical results, the kinetic theory of gases, as\r\nhitherto developed, stops absolutely short at the atom or molecule, and\r\ngives not even a suggestion toward explaining the properties in virtue of\r\nwhich the atoms or molecules mutually influence one another. For some\r\nguidance toward a deeper and more comprehensive theory of matter, we may\r\nlook back with advantage to the end of last century and beginning of this\r\ncentury, and find Rumford's conclusion regarding the heat generated in\r\nboring a brass gun: \"It appears to me to be extremely difficult, if not\r\nquite impossible, to form any distinct idea of anything capable of being\r\nexcited and communicated in the manner the heat was excited and\r\ncommunicated in these experiments, except it be MOTION;\" and Davy's still\r\nmore suggestive statements: \"The phenomena of repulsion are not dependent\r\non a peculiar elastic fluid for their existence.\" ... \"Heat may be defined\r\nas a peculiar motion, probably a vibration, of the corpuscles of bodies,\r\ntending to separate them.\" ... \"To distinguish this motion from others, and\r\nto signify the causes of our sensations of heat, etc., the name _repulsive_\r\nmotion has been adopted.\" Here we have a most important idea. It would be\r\nsomewhat a bold figure of speech to say the earth and moon are kept apart\r\nby a repulsive motion; and yet, after all, what is centrifugal force but a\r\nrepulsive motion, and may it not be that there is no such thing as\r\nrepulsion, and that it is solely by inertia that what seems to be repulsion\r\nis produced? Two bodies fly together, and, accelerated by mutual\r\nattraction, if they do not precisely hit one another, they cannot but\r\nseparate in virtue of the inertia of their masses. So, after dashing past\r\none another in sharply concave curves round their common center of gravity,\r\nthey fly asunder again. A careless onlooker might imagine they had repelled\r\none another, and might not notice the difference between what he actually\r\nsees and what he would see if the two bodies had been projected with great\r\nvelocity toward one another, and either colliding and rebounding, or\r\nrepelling one another into sharply convex continuous curves, fly asunder\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nJoule, Clausius, and Maxwell, and no doubt Daniel Bernoulli himself, and I\r\nbelieve every one who has hitherto written or done anything very explicit\r\nin the kinetic theory of gases, has taken the mutual action of molecules in\r\ncollision as repulsive. May it not after all be attractive? This idea has\r\nnever left my mind since I first read Davy's \"Repulsive Motion,\" about\r\nthirty-five years ago, and I never made anything of it, at all events have\r\nnot done so until to-day (June 16, 1884)--if this can be said to be making\r\nanything of it--when, in endeavoring to prepare the present address, I\r\nnotice that Joule's and my own old experiments[1] on the thermal effect of\r\ngases expanding from a high-pressure vessel through a porous plug, proves\r\nthe less dense gas to have greater intrinsic _potential_ energy than the\r\ndenser gas, if we assume the ordinary hypothesis regarding the temperature\r\nof a gas, according to which two gases are of equal temperatures [2] when\r\nthe kinetic energies of their constituent molecules are of equal average\r\namounts per molecule.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Republished in Sir W. Thomson's \"Mathematical and Physical\r\nPapers,\" vol. i., article xlix., p. 381. ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: That this is a mere hypothesis has been scarcely remarked by\r\nthe founders themselves, nor by almost any writer on the kinetic theory of\r\ngases. No one has yet examined the question, What is the condition as\r\nregards average distribution of kinetic energy, which is ultimately\r\nfulfilled by two portions of gaseous matter, separated by a thin elastic\r\nseptum which absolutely prevents interdiffusion of matter, while it allows\r\ninterchange of kinetic energy by collisions against itself? Indeed, I do\r\nnot know but, that the present is the very first statement which has ever\r\nbeen published of this condition of the problem of equal temperatures\r\nbetween two gaseous masses.]\r\n\r\nThink of the thing thus. Imagine a great multitude of particles inclosed by\r\na boundary which may be pushed inward in any part all round at pleasure.\r\nNow station an engineer corps of Maxwell's army of sorting demons all round\r\nthe inclosure, with orders to push in the boundary diligently everywhere,\r\nwhen none of the besieged troops are near, and to do nothing when any of\r\nthem are seen approaching, and until after they have turned again inward.\r\nThe result will be that, with exactly the same sum of kinetic and potential\r\nenergies of the same inclosed multitude of particles, the throng has been\r\ncaused to be denser. Now Joule's and my own old experiments on the efflux\r\nof air prove that if the crowd be common air, or oxygen, or nitrogen, or\r\ncarbonic acid, the temperature is a little higher in the denser than in the\r\nrarer condition when the energies are the same. By the hypothesis, equality\r\nof temperature between two different gases or two portions of the same gas\r\nat different densities means equality of kinetic energies in the same\r\nnumber of molecules of the two. From our observations proving the\r\ntemperature to be higher, it therefore follows that the potential energy is\r\nsmaller in the condensed crowd. This--always, however, under protest as to\r\nthe temperature hypothesis--proves some degree of attraction among the\r\nmolecules, but it does not prove ultimate attraction between two molecules\r\nin collision, or at distances much less than the average mutual distance of\r\nnearest neighbors in the multitude. The collisional force might be\r\nrepulsive, as generally supposed hitherto, and yet attraction might\r\npredominate in the whole reckoning of difference between the intrinsic\r\npotential energies of the more dense and less dense multitudes.\r\n\r\nIt is however remarkable that the explanation of the propagation of sound\r\nthrough gases, and even of the positive fluid pressure of a gas against the\r\nsides of the containing vessel, according to the kinetic theory of gases,\r\nis quite independent of the question whether the ultimate collisional force\r\nis attractive or repulsive. Of course it must be understood that, if it is\r\nattractive, the particles must, be so small that they hardly ever\r\nmeet--they would have to be infinitely small to _never_ meet--that, in\r\nfact, they meet so seldom, in comparison with the number of times their\r\ncourses--are turned through large angles by attraction, that the influence\r\nof these surely attractive collisions is preponderant over that of the\r\ncomparatively very rare impacts from actual contact. Thus, after all, the\r\ntrain of speculation suggested by Davy's \"Repulsive Motion\" does not allow\r\nus to escape from the idea of true repulsion, does not do more than let us\r\nsay it is of no consequence, nor even say this with truth, because, if\r\nthere are impacts at all, the nature of the force during the impact and the\r\neffects of the mutual impacts, however rare, cannot be evaded in any\r\nattempt to realize a conception of the kinetic theory of gases. And in\r\nfact, unless we are satisfied to imagine the atoms of a gas as mathematical\r\npoints endowed with inertia, and as, according to Boscovich, endowed with\r\nforces of mutual, positive, and negative attraction, varying according to\r\nsome definite function of the distance, we cannot avoid the question of\r\nimpacts, and of vibrations and rotations of the molecules resulting from\r\nimpacts, and we must look distinctly on each molecule as being either a\r\nlittle elastic solid or a configuration of motion in a continuous\r\nall-pervading liquid. I do not myself see how we can ever permanently rest\r\nanywhere short of this last view; but it would be a very pleasant temporary\r\nresting-place on the way to it if we could, as it were, make a mechanical\r\nmodel of a gas out of little pieces of round, perfectly elastic solid\r\nmatter, flying about through the space occupied by the gas, and colliding\r\nwith one another and against the sides of the containing vessel.\r\n\r\nThis is, in fact, all we have of the kinetic theory of gases up to the\r\npresent time, and this has done for us, in the hands of Clausius and\r\nMaxwell, the great things which constitute our first step toward a\r\nmolecular theory of matter. Of course from it we should have to go on to\r\nfind an explanation of the elasticity and all the other properties of the\r\nmolecules themselves, a subject vastly more complex and difficult than the\r\ngaseous properties, for the explanation of which we assume the elastic\r\nmolecule; but without any explanation of the properties of the molecule\r\nitself, with merely the assumption that the molecule has the requisite\r\nproperties, we might rest happy for a while in the contemplation of the\r\nkinetic theory of gases, and its explanation of the gaseous properties,\r\nwhich is not only stupendously important as a step toward a more\r\nthoroughgoing theory of matter, but is undoubtedly the expression of a\r\nperfectly intelligible and definite set of facts in Nature.\r\n\r\nBut alas for our mechanical model consisting of the cloud of little elastic\r\nsolids flying about among one another. Though each particle have absolutely\r\nperfect elasticity, the end must be pretty much the same as if it were but\r\nimperfectly elastic. The average effect of repeated and repeated mutual\r\ncollisions must be to gradually convert all the translational energy into\r\nenergy of shriller and shriller vibrations of the molecule. It seems\r\ncertain that each collision must have something more of energy in\r\nvibrations of very finely divided nodal parts than there was of energy in\r\nsuch vibrations before the impact. The more minute this nodal subdivision,\r\nthe less must be the tendency to give up part of the vibrational energy\r\ninto the shape of translational energy in the course of a collision; and I\r\nthink it is rigorously demonstrable that the whole translational energy\r\nmust ultimately become transformed into vibrational energy of higher and\r\nhigher nodal subdivisions if each molecule is a continuous elastic solid.\r\nLet us, then, leave the kinetic theory of gases for a time with this\r\ndifficulty unsolved, in the hope that we or others after us may return to\r\nit, armed with more knowledge of the properties of matter, and with sharper\r\nmathematical weapons to cut through the barrier which at present hides from\r\nus any view of the molecule itself, and of the effects other than mere\r\nchange of translational motion which it experiences in collision.\r\n\r\nTo explain the elasticity of a gas was the primary object of the kinetic\r\ntheory of gases. This object is only attainable by the assumption of an\r\nelasticity more complex in character, and more difficult of explanation,\r\nthan the elasticity of gases--the elasticity of a solid. Thus, even if the\r\nfatal fault in the theory, to which I have alluded, did not exist, and if\r\nwe could be perfectly satisfied with the kinetic theory of gases founded on\r\nthe collisions of elastic solid molecules, there would still be beyond it a\r\ngrander theory which need not be considered a chimerical object of\r\nscientific ambition--to explain the elasticity of solids. But we may be\r\nstopped when we commence to look in the direction of such a theory with the\r\ncynical question, What do you mean by explaining a property of matter? As\r\nto being stopped by any such question, all I can say is that if engineering\r\nwere to be all and to end all physical science, we should perforce be\r\ncontent with merely finding properties of matter by observation, and using\r\nthem for practical purposes. But I am sure very few, if any, engineers are\r\npractically satisfied with so narrow a view of their noble profession. They\r\nmust and do patiently observe, and discover by observation, properties of\r\nmatter and results of material combinations. But deeper questions are\r\nalways present, and always fraught with interest to the true engineer, and\r\nhe will be the last to give weight to any other objection to any attempt to\r\nsee below the surface of things than the practical question, Is it likely\r\nto prove wholly futile? But now, instead of imagining the question, What do\r\nyou mean by explaining a property of matter? to be put cynically, and\r\nletting ourselves be irritated by it, suppose we give to the questioner\r\ncredit for being sympathetic, and condescend to try and answer his\r\nquestion. We find it not very easy to do so. All the properties of matter\r\nare so connected that we can scarcely imagine one _thoroughly explained_\r\nwithout our seeing its relation to all the others, without in fact having\r\nthe explanation of all; and till we have this we cannot tell what we mean\r\nby \"explaining a property\" or \"explaining the properties\" of matter. But\r\nthough this consummation may never be reached by man, the progress of\r\nscience may be, I believe will be, step by step toward it, on many\r\ndifferent roads converging toward it from all sides. The kinetic theory of\r\ngases is, as I have said, a true step on one of the roads. On the very\r\ndistinct road of chemical science, St. Claire Deville arrived at his grand\r\ntheory of dissociation without the slightest aid from the kinetic theory of\r\ngases. The fact that he worked it out solely from chemical observation and\r\nexperiment, and expounded it to the world without any hypothesis whatever,\r\nand seemingly even without consciousness of the beautiful explanation it\r\nhas in the kinetic theory of gases, secured for it immediately an\r\nindependent solidity and importance as a chemical theory when he first\r\npromulgated it, to which it might even by this time scarcely have attained\r\nif it had first been suggested as a probability indicated by the kinetic\r\ntheory of gases, and been only afterward confirmed by observation. Now,\r\nhowever, guided by the views which Clausius and Williamson have given us of\r\nthe continuous interchange of partners between the compound molecules\r\nconstituting chemical compounds in the gaseous state, we see in Deville's\r\ntheory of dissociation a point of contact of the most transcendent interest\r\nbetween the chemical and physical lines of scientific progress.\r\n\r\nTo return to elasticity: if we could make out of matter devoid of\r\nelasticity a combined system of relatively moving parts which, in virtue of\r\nmotion, has the essential characteristics of an elastic body, this would\r\nsurely be, if not positively a step in the kinetic theory of matter, at\r\nleast a fingerpost pointing a way which we may hope will lead to a kinetic\r\ntheory of matter. Now this, as I have already shown,[1] we can do in\r\nseveral ways. In the case of the last of the communications referred to, of\r\nwhich only the title has hitherto been published, I showed that, from the\r\nmathematical investigation of a gyrostatically dominated combination\r\ncontained in the passage of Thomson and Tait's \"Natural Philosophy\"\r\nreferred to, it follows that any ideal system of material particles, acting\r\non one another mutually through massless connecting springs, may be\r\nperfectly imitated in a model consisting of rigid links jointed together,\r\nand having rapidly rotating fly wheels pivoted on some or on all of the\r\nlinks. The imitation is not confined to cases of equilibrium. It holds also\r\nfor vibration produced by disturbing the system infinitesimally from a\r\nposition of stable equilibrium and leaving it to itself. Thus we may make a\r\ngyrostatic system such that it is in equilibrium under the influence of\r\ncertain positive forces applied to different points of this system; all the\r\nforces being precisely the same as, and the points of application similarly\r\nsituated to, those of the stable system with springs. Then, provided proper\r\nmasses (that is to say, proper amounts and distributions of inertia) be\r\nattributed to the links, we may remove the external forces from each\r\nsystem, and the consequent vibration of the points of application of the\r\nforces will be identical. Or we may act upon the systems of material points\r\nand springs with any given forces for any given time, and leave it to\r\nitself, and do the same thing for the gyrostatic system; the consequent\r\nmotion will be the same in the two cases. If in the one case the springs\r\nare made more and more stiff, and in the other case the angular velocities\r\nof the fly wheels are made greater and greater, the periods of the\r\nvibrational constituents of the motion will become shorter and shorter, and\r\nthe amplitudes smaller and smaller, and the motions will approach more and\r\nmore nearly those of two perfectly rigid groups of material points moving\r\nthrough space and rotating according to the well known mode of rotation of\r\na rigid body having unequal moments of inertia about its three principal\r\naxes. In one case the ideal nearly rigid connection between the particles\r\nis produced by massless, exceedingly stiff springs; in the other case it is\r\nproduced by the exceedingly rapid rotation of the fly wheels in a system\r\nwhich, when the fly wheels are deprived of their rotation, is perfectly\r\nlimp.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Paper on \"Vortex Atoms,\" _Proc_.

The inclosing circle\r\nrepresents in each case in section an inclosing spherical shell to prevent\r\nthe interior from being seen. In the inside of one there are fly-wheels, in\r\nthe inside of the other a massless spring. The projecting hooked rods seem\r\nas if they are connected by a spring in each case. If we hang any one of\r\nthe systems up by the hook on one of its projecting rods, and hang a weight\r\nto the hook of the other projecting rod, the weight, when first put on,\r\nwill oscillate up and down, and will go on doing so for ever if the system\r\nbe absolutely unfrictional. If we check the vibration by hand, the weight\r\nwill hang down at rest, the pin drawn out to a certain degree; and the\r\ndistance drawn out will be simply proportional to the weight hung on, as in\r\nan ordinary spring balance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In Fig. 1 the two hooked rods seen projecting from the sphere\r\nare connected by an elastic coach-spring. In Fig. 2 the hooked rods are\r\nconnected one to each of two opposite corners of a four-sided jointed\r\nframe, each member of which carries a gyrostat so that the axis of rotation\r\nof the fly-wheel is in the axis of the member of the frame which bears it.\r\nEach of the hooked rods in Fig. 2 is connected to the framework through a\r\nswivel joint, so that the whole gyrostatic framework may be rotated about\r\nthe axis of the hooked rods in order to annul the moment of momentum of the\r\nframework about this axis due to rotation of the fly-wheels in the\r\ngyrostat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\r\n\r\nHere, then, out of matter possessing rigidity, but absolutely devoid of\r\nelasticity, we have made a perfect model of a spring in the form of a\r\nspring balance. Connect millions of millions of particles by pairs of rods\r\nsuch as these of this spring balance, and we have a group of particles\r\nconstituting an elastic solid; exactly fulfilling the mathematical ideal\r\nworked out by Navier, Poisson, and Cauchy, and many other mathematicians,\r\nwho, following their example, have endeavored to found a theory of the\r\nelasticity of solids on mutual attraction and repulsion between a group of\r\nmaterial particles. All that can possibly be done by this theory, with its\r\nassumption of forces acting according to any assumed law of relation to\r\ndistance, is done by the gyrostatic system. But the gyrostatic system does,\r\nbesides, what the system of naturally acting material particles cannot\r\ndo--it constitutes an elastic solid which can have the Faraday\r\nmagneto-optic rotation of the plane of polarization of light; supposing the\r\napplication of our solid to be a model of the luminiferous ether for\r\nillustrating the undulatory theory of light. The gyrostatic model spring\r\nbalance is arranged to have zero moment of momentum as a whole, and\r\ntherefore to contribute nothing to the Faraday rotation; with this\r\narrangement the model illustrates the luminiferous ether in a field\r\nunaffected by magnetic force. But now let there be a different rotational\r\nvelocity imparted to the jointed square round the axis of the two\r\nprojecting hooked rods, such as to give a resultant moment of momentum\r\nround any given line through the center of inertia of the system; and let\r\npairs of the hooked rods in the model thus altered, which is no longer a\r\nmodel of a mere spring balance, be applied as connections between millions\r\nof pairs of particles as before, with the lines of resultant moment of\r\nmomentum all similarly directed. We now have a model elastic solid which\r\nwill have the property that the direction of vibration in waves of\r\nrectilinear vibrations propagated through it shall turn round the line of\r\npropagation of the waves, just as Faraday's observation proves to be done\r\nby the line of vibration of light in a dense medium between the poles of a\r\npowerful magnet. The case of wave front perpendicular to the lines of\r\nresultant moment of momentum (that is to say, the direction of propagation\r\nbeing parallel to these lines) corresponds, in our mechanical model, to the\r\ncase of light traveling in the direction of the lines of force in a\r\nmagnetic field.\r\n\r\nIn these illustrations and models we have different portions of ideal rigid\r\nmatter acting upon one another, by normal pressure at mathematical points\r\nof contact--of course no forces of friction are supposed. It is exceedingly\r\ninteresting to see how thus, with no other postulates than inertia,\r\nrigidity, and mutual impenetrability, we can thoroughly model not only an\r\nelastic solid, and any combination of elastic solids, but so complex and\r\nrecondite a phenomenon as the passage of polarized light through a magnetic\r\nfield. But now, with the view of ultimately discarding the postulate of\r\nrigidity from all our materials, let us suppose some to be absolutely\r\ndestitute of rigidity, and to possess merely inertia and incompressibility,\r\nand mutual impenetrability with reference to the still remaining rigid\r\nmatter. With these postulates we can produce a perfect model of mutual\r\naction at a distance between solid particles, fulfilling the condition, so\r\nkeenly desired by Newton and Faraday, of being explained by continuous\r\naction through an intervening medium. The law of the mutual force in our\r\nmodel, however, is not the simple Newtonian law, but the much more complex\r\nlaw of the mutual action between electro magnets--with this difference,\r\nthat in the hydro-kinetic model in every case the force is opposite in\r\ndirection to the corresponding force in the electro-magnetic analogue.\r\nImagine a solid bored through with a hole, and placed in our ideal perfect\r\nliquid. For a moment let the hole be stopped by a diaphragm, and let an\r\nimpulsure pressure be applied for an instant uniformly over the whole\r\nmembrane, and then instantly let the membrane be dissolved into liquid.\r\nThis action originates a motion of the liquid relatively to the solid, of a\r\nkind to which I have given the name of \"irrotational circulation,\" which\r\nremains absolutely constant however the solid be moved through the liquid.\r\nThus, at any time the actual motion of the liquid at any point in the\r\nneighborhood of the solid will be the resultant of the motion it would have\r\nin virtue of the circulation alone, were the solid at rest, and the motion\r\nit would have in virtue of the motion of the solid itself, had there been\r\nno circulation established through the aperture. It is interesting and\r\nimportant to remark in passing that the whole kinetic energy of the liquid\r\nis the sum of the kinetic energies which it would have in the two cases\r\nseparately. Now, imagine the whole liquid to be inclosed in an infinitely\r\nlarge, rigid, containing vessel, and in the liquid, at an infinite distance\r\nfrom any part of the containing vessel, let two perforated solids, with\r\nirrotational circulation through each, be placed at rest near one another.\r\nThe resultant fluid motion due to the two circulations, will give rise to\r\nfluid pressure on the two bodies, which, if unbalanced, will cause them to\r\nmove. The force systems--force-and-torques, or pairs of forces--required to\r\nprevent them from moving will be mutual and opposite, and will be the same\r\nas, but opposite in direction to, the mutual force systems required to hold\r\nat rest two electromagnets fulfilling the following specification: The two\r\nelectro magnets are to be of the same shape and size as the two bodies, and\r\nto be placed in the same relative positions, and to consist of infinitely\r\nthin layers of electric currents in the surfaces of solids possessing\r\nextreme diamagnetic quality--in other words, infinitely small permeability.\r\nThe distribution of electric current on each body may be any whatever which\r\nfulfills the condition that the total current across any closed line drawn\r\non the surface once through the aperture is equal to ¼ [pi] of the\r\ncirculation[1] through the aperture in the hydro-kinetic analogue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The integral of tangential component velocity all round any\r\nclosed curve, passing once through the aperture, is defined as the\r\n\"cyclic-constant\" or the \"circulation\" (\"Vortex Motion,\" § 60 (a), _Trans_.\r\nR.S.E., April 29, 1867). It has the same value for all closed curves\r\npassing just once through the aperture, and it remains constant through all\r\ntime, whether the solid body be in motion or at rest.]\r\n\r\nIt might be imagined that the action at a distance thus provided for by\r\nfluid motion could serve as a foundation for a theory of the equilibrium,\r\nand the vibrations, of elastic solids, and the transmission of waves like\r\nthose of light through an extended quasi-elastic solid medium. But\r\nunfortunately for this idea the equilibrium is essentially unstable, both\r\nin the case of magnets and, notwithstanding the fact that the forces are\r\noppositely directed, in the hydro-kinetic analogue also, when the several\r\nmovable bodies (two or any greater number) are so placed relatively as to\r\nbe in equilibrium. If, however, we connect the perforated bodies with\r\ncirculation through them in the hydro-kinetic system, by jointed rigid\r\nconnecting links, we may arrange for configurations of stable equilibrium.\r\nThus, without fly-wheels, but with fluid circulations through apertures, we\r\nmay make a model spring balance or a model luminiferous ether, either\r\nwithout or with the rotational quality corresponding to that of the true\r\nluminiferous ether in the magnetic fluid--in short, do all by the\r\nperforated solids with circulations through them that we saw we could do by\r\nmeans of linked gyrostats. But something that we cannot do by linked\r\ngyrostats we can do by the perforated bodies with fluid circulation: we can\r\nmake a model gas. The mutual action at a distance, repulsive or attractive\r\naccording to the mutual aspect of the two bodies when passing within\r\ncollisional distance[1] of one another, suffices to produce the change of\r\ndirection of motion in collision, which essentially constitutes the\r\nfoundation of the kinetic theory of gases, and which, as we have seen\r\nbefore, may as well be due to attraction as to repulsion, so far as we know\r\nfrom any investigation hitherto made in this theory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: According to this view, there is no precise distance, or\r\ndefinite condition respecting the distance, between two molecules, at which\r\napparently they come to be in collision, or when receding from one another\r\nthey cease to be in collision. It is convenient, however, in the kinetic\r\ntheory of gases, to adopt arbitrarily a precise definition of collision,\r\naccording to which two bodies or particles mutually acting at a distance\r\nmay be said to be in collision when their mutual action exceeds some\r\ndefinite arbitrarily assigned limit, as, for example, when the radius of\r\ncurvature of the path of either body is less than a stated fraction (one\r\none-hundredth, for instance) of the distance between them.]\r\n\r\nThere remains, however, as we have seen before, the difficulty of providing\r\nfor the case of actual impacts between the solids, which must be done by\r\ngiving them massless spring buffers or, which amounts to the same thing,\r\nattributing to them repulsive forces sufficiently powerful at very short\r\ndistances to absolutely prevent impacts between solid and solid; unless we\r\nadopt the equally repugnant idea of infinitely small perforated solids,\r\nwith infinitely great fluid circulations through them. Were it not for this\r\nfundamental difficulty, the hydro-kinetic model gas would be exceedingly\r\ninteresting; and, though we could scarcely adopt it as conceivably a true\r\nrepresentation of what gases really are, it might still have some\r\nimportance as a model configuration of solid and liquid matter, by which\r\nwithout elasticity the elasticity of true gas might be represented.\r\n\r\nBut lastly, since the hydro-kinetic model gas with perforated solids and\r\nfluid circulations through them fails because of the impacts between the\r\nsolids, let us annul the solids and leave the liquid performing\r\nirrotational circulation round vacancy,[1] in the place of the solid cores\r\nwhich we have hitherto supposed; or let us annul the rigidity of the solid\r\ncores of the rings, and give them molecular rotation according to\r\nHelmholtz's theory of vortex motion. For stability the molecular rotation\r\nmust be such as to give the same velocity at the boundary of the rotational\r\nfluid core as that of the irrotationally circulating liquid in contact with\r\nit, because, as I have proved, frictional slip between two portions of\r\nliquid in contact is inconsistent with stability. There is a further\r\ncondition, upon which I cannot enter into detail just now, but which may be\r\nunderstood in a general way when I say that it is a condition of either\r\nuniform or of increasing molecular rotation from the surface inward,\r\nanalogous to the condition that the density of a liquid, resting for\r\nexample under the influence of gravity, must either be uniform or must be\r\ngreater below than above for stability of equilibrium. All that I have said\r\nin favor of the model vortex gas composed of perforated solids with fluid\r\ncirculations through them holds without modification for the purely\r\nhydro-kinetic model, composed of either Helmholtz cored vortex rings or of\r\ncoreless vortices, and we are now troubled with no such difficulty as that\r\nof the impacts between solids. Whether, however, when the vortex theory of\r\ngases is thoroughly worked out, it will or will not be found to fail in a\r\nmanner analogous to the failure which I have already pointed out in\r\nconnection with the kinetic theory of gases composed of little elastic\r\nsolid molecules, I cannot at present undertake to speak with certainty. It\r\nseems to me most probable that the vortex theory cannot fail in any such\r\nway, because all I have been able to find out hitherto regarding the\r\nvibration of vortices,[2] whether cored or coreless, does not seem to imply\r\nthe liability of translational or impulsive energies of the individual\r\nvortices becoming lost in energy of smaller and smaller vibrations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Investigations respecting coreless vortices will be found in a\r\npaper by the author, \"Vibrations of a Columnar Vortex,\" _Proc_. R.S.E.,\r\nMarch 1, 1880; and a paper by Hicks, recently read before the Royal\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See papers by the author \"On Vortex Motion.\" _Trans_. R.S.E.\r\nApril, 1867, and \"Vortex Statics,\" _Proc_. R.S.E. December, 1875; also a\r\npaper by J.J. Thomson, B.A., \"On the Vibrations of a Vortex Ring,\" _Trans_.\r\nR.S. December, 1881, and his valuable book on \"Vortex Motion.\"]\r\n\r\nAs a step toward kinetic theory of matter, it is certainly most interesting\r\nto remark that in the quasi-elasticity, elasticity looking like that of an\r\nIndia-rubber band, which we see in a vibrating smoke-ring launched from an\r\nelliptic aperture, or in two smoke-rings which were circular, but which\r\nhave become deformed from circularity by mutual collision, we have in\r\nreality a virtual elasticity in matter devoid of elasticity, and even\r\ndevoid of rigidity, the virtual elasticity being due to motion, and\r\ngenerated by the generation of motion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY TO TRAMWAYS.\r\n\r\nBy M. HOLROYD SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year, when I had the pleasure of reading a paper before you on my new\r\nsystem of electric tramways, I ventured to express the hope that before\r\ntwelve months had passed, \"to be able to report progress,\" and I am happy\r\nto say that notwithstanding the wearisome delay and time lost in fruitless\r\nnegotiations, and the hundred and one difficulties within and without that\r\nhave beset me, I am able to appear before you again and tell you of\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nPractical men know well that there is a wide difference between a model and\r\na full sized machine; and when I decided to construct a full sized tramcar\r\nand lay out a full sized track, I found it necessary to make many\r\nalterations of detail, my chief difficulty being so to design my work as to\r\nfacilitate construction and allow of compensation for that inaccuracy of\r\nworkmanship which I have come to regard as inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the directors of a tramway company of the practical\r\nnature of my system before disturbing their lines, I have laid, in a field\r\nnear the works of Messrs. Smith, Baker & Co., Manchester, a track 110 yards\r\nlong, 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge, and I have constructed a full sized street\r\ntramcar to run thereon. My negotiations being with a company in a town\r\nwhere there are no steep gradients, and where the coefficient of friction\r\nof ordinary wheels would be sufficient for all tractive purposes, I thought\r\nit better to avoid the complication involved in employing a large central\r\nwheel with a broad surface specially designed for hilly districts, and with\r\nwhich I had mounted a gradient of one in sixteen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\r\n\r\nBut as the line in question was laid with all the curves unnecessarily\r\nquick, even those in the \"pass-bies,\" I thought it expedient to employ\r\ndifferential gear, as illustrated at D, Fig. 1, which is a sketch plan\r\nshowing the mechanism employed. M is a Siemens electric motor running at\r\n650 revolutions per minute; E is a combination of box gearing, frictional\r\nclutch, and chain pinion, and from this pinion a steel chain passes around\r\nthe chain-wheel, H, which is free to revolve upon the axle, and carries\r\nwithin it the differential pinion, gearing with the bevel-wheel, B², keyed\r\nupon the sleeve of the loose tram-wheel, T², and with the bevel-wheel, B¹,\r\nkeyed upon the axle, to which the other tram-wheel, T¹, is attached. To the\r\nother tram-wheels no gear is connected; one of them is fast to the axle,\r\nand the other runs loose, but to them the brake is applied in the usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe electric current from the collector passes, by means of a copper wire,\r\nand a switch upon the dashboard of the car, and resistance coils placed\r\nunder the seats, to the motor, and from the motor by means of an adjustable\r\nclip (illustrated in diagram, Fig. 2) to the axles, and by them through the\r\nfour wheels to the rails, which form the return circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\r\n\r\nI have designed many modifications of the track, but it is, perhaps, best\r\nat present to describe only that which I have in actual use, and it is\r\nillustrated in diagram, Fig. 3, which is a sectional and perspective view\r\nof the central channel. L is the surface of the road, and SS are the\r\nsleepers, CC are the chairs which hold the angle iron, AA forming the\r\nlongitudinally slotted center rail and the electric lead, which consists of\r\ntwo half-tubes of copper insulated from the chairs by the blocks, I, I. A\r\nspecial brass clamp, free to slide upon the tube, is employed for this\r\npurpose, and the same form of clamp serves to join the two ends of the\r\ncopper tubes together and to make electric contact. Two half-tubes instead\r\nof one slotted tube have been employed, in order to leave a free passage\r\nfor dirt or wet to fall through the slot in the center rail to the drain\r\nspace, G. Between chair and chair hewn granite or artificial stone is\r\nemployed, formed, as shown in the drawing, to complete the surface of the\r\nroad and to form a continuous channel or drain. In order that this drain\r\nmay not become choked, at suitable intervals, in the length of the track,\r\nsump holes are formed as illustrated in diagram, Fig. 4 These sump holes\r\nhave a well for the accumulation of mud, and are also connected with the\r\nmain street drain, so that water can freely pass away. The hand holes\r\nafford facility for easily removing the dirt.\r\n\r\nIn a complete track these hand holes would occasionally be wider than shown\r\nhere, for the purpose of removing or fixing the collector, Fig. 5, which\r\nconsists of two sets of spirally fluted rollers free to revolve upon\r\nspindles, which are held by knuckle-joints drawn together by spiral\r\nsprings; by this means the pressure of the rollers against the inside of\r\nthe tube is constantly maintained, and should any obstruction occur in the\r\ntube the spiral flute causes it to revolve, thus automatically cleansing\r\nthe tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\r\n\r\nThe collector is provided with two steel plates, which pass through the\r\nslit in the center rail; the lower ends of these plates are clamped by the\r\nupper frame of the collector, insulating material being interposed, and the\r\nupper ends are held in two iron cheeks. Between these steel plates\r\ninsulated copper strips are held, electrically connected with the collector\r\nand with the adjustable clip mounted upon the iron cheeks; this clip holds\r\nthe terminal on the end of the wire (leading to the motor) firmly enough\r\nfor use, the cheeks being also provided with studs for the attachment of\r\nleather straps hooked on to the framework of the car, one for the forward\r\nand one for backward movement of the collector. These straps are strong\r\nenough for the ordinary haulage of the collector, and for the removal of\r\npebbles and dirt that may get into the slit; but should any absolute block\r\noccur then they break and the terminal is withdrawn from the clip; the\r\nelectric contact being thereby broken the car stops, the obstruction can\r\nthen be removed and the collector reconnected without damage and with\r\nlittle delay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\r\n\r\nIn order to secure continuity of the center rail throughout the length of\r\nthe track, and still provide for the removal of the collector at frequent\r\nintervals, the framework of the collector is so made that, by slackening\r\nthe side-bolts, the steel plates can be drawn upward and the collector\r\nitself withdrawn sideways through the hand holes, one of the half-tubes\r\nbeing removed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nFig. 6 illustrates another arrangement that I have constructed, both of\r\ncollector and method of collecting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6]\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, the arrangement now described has been carried out in\r\na field near the works of Messrs. Smith, Baker & Co., Cornbrook Telegraph\r\nWorks, Manchester, and its working efficiency has been most satisfactory.\r\nAfter a week of rain and during drenching showers the car ran with the same\r\nspeed and under the same control as when the ground was dry.\r\n\r\nThis I account for by the theory that when the rails are wet and the tubes\r\nmoist the better contact made compensates for the slight leakage that may\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of my paper I promised to confine myself to work done;\r\nI therefore abstain from describing various modifications of detail for the\r\nsame purpose. But one method of supporting and insulating the conductor in\r\nthe channel may be suggested by an illustration of the plan I adopted for a\r\nlittle pleasure line in the Winter Gardens, Blackpool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nFig. 7. There the track being exclusively for the electric railway, it was\r\nnot necessary to provide a center channel; the conductor has therefore been\r\nplaced in the center of the track, and consists of bar iron 1¼ in. by ½\r\nin., and is held vertically by means of studs riveted into the side; these\r\nstuds pass through porcelain insulators, and by means of wooden clamps and\r\nwedges are held in the iron chairs which rest upon the sleepers. The iron\r\nconductors were placed vertically to facilitate bending round the sharp\r\ncurves which were unavoidable on this line.\r\n\r\nThe collector consists of two metal slippers held together by springs,\r\nattached to the car by straps and electrically connected to the motor by\r\nclips in the same manner as the one employed in Manchester.\r\n\r\nI am glad to say that, notwithstanding the curves with a radius of 55 feet\r\nand gradients of 1 in 57, this line is also a practical success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRES IN LONDON AND NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the chief of the London Fire Brigade visited the United States in\r\n1882, he was, as is the general rule on the other side of the Atlantic,\r\n\"interviewed\"--a custom, it may be remarked, which appears to be gaining\r\nground also in this country. The inferences drawn from these interviews\r\nseem to be that the absence of large fires in London was chiefly due to the\r\nsuperiority of our fire brigade, and that the greater frequency of\r\nconflagrations in American cities, and particularly in New York, was due to\r\nthe inferiority of their fire departments. How unjust such a comparison\r\nwould be is shown in a paper presented by Mr. Edward B. Dorsey, a member\r\nof the American Society of Civil Engineers, to that association, in which\r\nthe author discusses the comparative liability to and danger from\r\nconflagrations in London and in American cities. He found from an\r\ninvestigation which he conducted with much care during a visit to London\r\nthat it is undoubtedly true that large fires are much less frequent in the\r\nmetropolis than in American cities; but it is equally true that the\r\ncircumstances existing in London and New York are quite different. As it is\r\na well-known fact that the promptness, efficiency, and bravery of American\r\nfiremen cannot be surpassed, we gladly give prominence to the result of the\r\nauthor's investigations into the true causes of the great liability of\r\nAmerican cities to large fires. In a highly interesting comparison the\r\nwriter has selected New York and London as typical cities, although his\r\nobservations will apply to most American and English towns, if, perhaps,\r\nwith not quite the same force. In the first place, the efforts of the\r\nLondon Fire Brigade receive much aid from our peculiarly damp climate. From\r\nthe average of eleven years (1871-1881) of the meteorological observations\r\nmade at the Greenwich Observatory, it appears that in London it rains, on\r\nthe average, more than three days in the week, that the sun shines only\r\none-fourth of the time he is above the horizon, and that the atmosphere\r\nonly lacks 18 per cent. of complete saturation, and is cloudy seven-tenths\r\nof the time. Moreover, the humidity of the atmosphere in London is very\r\nuniform, varying but little in the different months. Under these\r\ncircumstances, wood will not be ignited very easily by sparks or by contact\r\nwith a weak flame. This is very different from the condition of wood in the\r\nlong, hot, dry seasons of the American continent. The average temperature\r\nfor the three winter months in London is 38.24 degrees Fahr.; in New York\r\nit is 31.56 degrees, or 6.68 degrees lower. This lower range of temperature\r\nmust be the cause of many conflagrations, for, to make up for the\r\ndeficiency in the natural temperature, there must be in New York many more\r\nand larger domestic fires. The following statistics, taken from the records\r\nof the New York Fire Department, show this. In the three winter months of\r\n1881, January, February, and December, there were 522 fire alarms in New\r\nYork, or an average per month of 174; in the remaining nine months 1,263,\r\nor an average per month of 140. In the corresponding three winter months of\r\n1882 there were 602 fire alarms, or an average per month of 201; in the\r\nremaining nine months 1,401, or an average per month of 155. In round\r\nnumbers there were in 1881 one-fourth, and in 1882 one-third more fire\r\nalarms in the three winter months than in the nine warmer months. We are\r\nnot aware that similar statistics have ever been compiled for London, and\r\nare consequently unable to draw comparison; but, speaking from\r\nrecollection, fires appear to be more frequent also in London during the\r\nwinter months.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the greater frequency of fires in New York and their more\r\ndestructive nature is the greater density of population in that city. The\r\nLondon Metropolitan Police District covers 690 square miles, extending 12\r\nto 15 miles in every direction from Charing Cross, and contained in 1881 a\r\npopulation of 4,764,312; but what is generally known as London covers 122\r\nsquare miles, containing, in 1881, 528,794 houses, and a population of\r\n3,814,574, averaging 7.21 persons per house, 49 per acre, and 31,267 per\r\nsquare mile. Now let us look at New York. South of Fortieth Street between\r\nthe Hudson and East Rivers, New York has an area of 3,905 acres, a fraction\r\nover six square miles, exclusive of piers, and contained, according to the\r\ncensus of 1880, a population of 813,076. This gives 208 persons per acre.\r\nThe census of 1880 reports the total number of dwellings in New York at\r\n73,684; total population, 1,206,299; average per dwelling, 16.37. Selecting\r\nfor comparison an area about equal from the fifteen most densely populated\r\ndistricts or parishes of London, of an aggregate area of 3,896 acres, and\r\nwith a total population of 746,305, we obtain 191.5 persons per acre. Thus\r\nbriefly New York averaged 208 persons per acre, and 16.37 per dwelling;\r\nLondon, for the same area, 191.5 persons per acre, and 7.21 per house. But\r\nthis comparison is scarcely fair, as in London only the most populous and\r\npoorest districts are included, corresponding to the entirely tenement\r\ndistricts of New York, while in the latter city it includes the richest and\r\nmost fashionable sections, as well as the poorest. If tenement districts\r\nwere taken alone, the population would be found much more dense, and New\r\nYork proportionately much more densely populated. Taking four of the most\r\nthickly populated of the London districts (East London, Strand, Old Street,\r\nSt. Luke's, St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury), we find\r\non a total area of 792 acres a population of 197,285, or an average of 249\r\npersons per acre. In four of the most densely populated wards of New York\r\n(10th, 11th, 13th, and 17th), we have on an area of 735 acres a population\r\nof 258,966, or 352 persons per acre. This is 40 per cent. higher than in\r\nLondon, the districts being about the same size, each containing about\r\n1-1/5 square miles. Apart from the greater crowding which takes place in\r\nNew York, and the different style of buildings, another very fertile cause\r\nof the spreading of fires is the freer use of wood in their construction.\r\nIt is asserted that in New York there is more than double the quantity of\r\nwood used in buildings per acre than in London. From a house census\r\nundertaken in 1882 by the New York Fire Department, moreover, it appears\r\nthat there were 106,885 buildings including sheds, of which 28,798 houses\r\nwere built of wood or other inflammable materials, besides 3,803 wooden\r\nsheds, giving a total of 32,601 wooden buildings.\r\n\r\nWe are not aware that there are any wooden houses left in London. There are\r\nother minor causes which act as checks upon the spreading of fires in\r\nLondon. London houses are mostly small in size, and fires are thus confined\r\nto a limited space between brick walls. Their walls are generally low and\r\nwell braced, which enable the firemen to approach them without danger.\r\nAbout 60 per cent. of London houses are less than 22 feet high from the\r\npavement to the eaves; more than half of the remainder are less than 40\r\nfeet high, very few being over 50 feet high. This, of course, excludes the\r\nnewer buildings in the City. St. James's Palace does not exceed 40 feet,\r\nthe Bank of England not over 30 feet in height; but these are exceptional\r\nstructures. Fireproof roofings and projecting party walls also retard the\r\nspreading of conflagrations. The houses being comparatively low and small,\r\nthe firemen are enabled to throw water easily over them, and to reach their\r\nroofs with short ladders. There is in London an almost universal absence of\r\nwooden additions and outbuildings, and the New York ash barrel or box kept\r\nin the house is also unknown. The local authorities in London keep a strict\r\nwatch over the manufacture or storage of combustible materials in populous\r\nparts of the city. Although overhead telegraph wires are multiplying to an\r\nalarming extent in London, their number is nothing to be compared to their\r\nbewildering multitude in New York, where their presence is not only a\r\nhinderance to the operations of the firemen, but a positive danger to their\r\nlives. Finally--and this has already been partly dealt with in speaking of\r\nthe comparative density of population of the two cities--a look at the map\r\nof London will show us how the River Thames and the numerous parks,\r\nsquares, private grounds, wide streets, as well as the railways running\r\ninto London, all act as effectual barriers to the extension of fires.\r\n\r\nThe recent great conflagrations in the city vividly illustrate to Londoners\r\nwhat fire could do if their metropolis were built on the New York plan. The\r\nCity, however, as we have remarked, is an exceptional part of London, and,\r\ntaking the British metropolis as it is, with its hundreds of square miles\r\nof suburbs, and contrasting its condition with that of New York, we are led\r\nto adopt the opinion that London, with its excellent fire brigade, is safe\r\nfrom a destructive conflagration. It was stated above, and it is repeated\r\nhere, that the fire brigade of New York is unsurpassed for promptness,\r\nskill, and heroic intrepidity, but their task, by contrast, is a heavy one\r\nin a city like New York, with its numerous wooden buildings, wooden or\r\nasphalt roofs, buildings from four to ten stories high, with long unbraced\r\nwalls, weakened by many large windows, containing more than ten times the\r\ntimber an average London house does, and that very inflammable, owing to\r\nthe dry and hot American climate. But this is not all. In New York we find\r\nthe five and six story tenement houses with two or three families on each\r\nfloor, each with their private ash barrel or box kept handy in their rooms,\r\nall striving to keep warm during the severe winters of North America. We\r\nalso find narrow streets and high buildings, with nothing to arrest the\r\nextension of a fire except a few small parks, not even projecting or\r\neffectual fire-walls between the several buildings. And to all this must be\r\nadded the perfect freedom with which the city authorities of New York allow\r\nin its most populous portions large stables, timber yards, carpenters'\r\nshops, and the manufacture and storage of inflammable materials. Personal\r\nliberty could not be carried to a more dangerous extent. We ought to be\r\nthankful that in such matters individual freedom is somewhat hampered in\r\nour old-fashioned and quieter-going country.--_London Morning Post_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATEST KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gape worm may be termed the _bete noir_ of the poultry-keeper--his\r\ngreatest enemy--whether he be farmer or fancier. It is true there are some\r\nwho declare that it is unknown in their poultry-yards--that they have never\r\nbeen troubled with it at all. These are apt to lay it down, as I saw a\r\ncorrespondent did in a recent number of the _Country Gentleman_, that the\r\ncause is want of cleanliness or neglect in some way. But I can vouch that\r\nthat is not so. I have been in yards where everything was first-rate, where\r\nthe cleanliness was almost painfully complete, where no fault in the way of\r\nneglect could be found, and yet the gapes were there; and on the other\r\nhand, I have known places where every condition seemed favorable to the\r\ndevelopment of such a disease, and there it was absent--this not in\r\nisolated cases, but in many. No, we must look elsewhere for the cause.\r\n\r\nObservations lead me to the belief that gapes are more than usually\r\ntroublesome during a wet spring or summer following a mild winter. This\r\nwould tend to show that the egg from which the worm (that is in itself the\r\ndisease) emerges is communicated from the ground, from the food eaten, or\r\nthe water drunk, in the first instance, but it is more than possible that\r\nthe insects themselves may pass from one fowl to another. All this we can\r\naccept as a settled fact, and also any description of the way in which the\r\nparasitic worms attach themselves to the throats of the birds, and cause\r\nthe peculiar gaping of the mouth which gives the name to the disease.\r\n\r\nMany remedies have been suggested, and my object now is to communicate some\r\nof the later ones--thus to give a variety of methods, so that in case of\r\nthe failure of one, another will be at hand ready to be tried. It is a\r\nmistake always to pin the faith to one remedy, for the varying conditions\r\nfound in fowls compel a different treatment. The old plan of dislodging the\r\nworms with a feather is well known, and need not be described again. But I\r\nmay mention that in this country some have found the use of an ointment,\r\nfirst suggested by Mr. Lewis Wright, I believe, most valuable. This is made\r\nof mercurial ointment, two parts; pure lard, two parts; flour of sulphur,\r\none part; crude petroleum, one part--and when mixed together is applied to\r\nthe heads of the chicks as soon as they are dry after hatching. Many have\r\ntestified that they have never found this to fail as a preventive, and if\r\nthe success is to be attributed to the ointment, it would seem as if the\r\ninsects are driven off by its presence, for the application to the heads\r\nmerely would not kill the eggs.\r\n\r\nSome time ago Lord Walsingham offered, through the Entomological Society of\r\nLondon, a prize for the best life history of the gapes disease, and this\r\nhas been won by the eminent French scientist M. Pierre Mégnin, whose essay\r\nhas been published by the noble donor. His offer was in the interest of\r\npheasant breeders, but the benefit is not confined to that variety of game\r\nalone, for it is equally applicable to all gallinaceous birds troubled with\r\nthis disease. The pamphlet in question is a very valuable work, and gives\r\nvery clearly the methods by which the parasite develops. But for our\r\npurpose it will be sufficient to narrate what M. Mégnin recommends for the\r\ncure of it. These are various, as will be seen, and comprise the experience\r\nof other inquirers as well as himself.\r\n\r\nHe states that Montague obtained great success by a combination of the\r\nfollowing methods: Removal from infested runs; a thorough change of food,\r\nhemp seed and green vegetables figuring largely in the diet; and for\r\ndrinking, instead of plain water, an infusion of rue and garlic. And Mégnin\r\nhimself mentions an instance of the value of garlic. In the years 1877 and\r\n1878, the pheasant preserves of Fontainebleau were ravaged by gapes. The\r\ndisease was there arrested and totally cured, when a mixture, consisting of\r\nyolks of eggs, boiled bullock's heart, stale bread crumbs, and leaves of\r\nnettle, well mixed and pounded together with garlic, was given, in the\r\nproportion of one clove to ten young pheasants. The birds were found to be\r\nvery fond of this mixture, but great care was taken to see that the\r\ndrinking vessels were properly cleaned out and refilled with clean, pure\r\nwater twice a day. This treatment has met with the same success in other\r\nplaces, and if any of your readers are troubled with gapes and will try it,\r\nI shall be pleased to see the results narrated in the columns of the\r\n_Country Gentleman_. Garlic in this case is undoubtedly the active\r\ningredient, and as it is volatile, when taken into the stomach the breath\r\nis charged with it, and in this way (for garlic is a powerful vermifuge)\r\nthe worms are destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnother remedy recommended by M. Mégnin was the strong smelling vermifuge\r\nassafoetida, known sometimes by the suggestive name of \"devil's dung.\" It\r\nhas one of the most disgusting oders possible, and is not very pleasant to\r\nbe near. The assafoetida was mixed with an equal part of powdered yellow\r\ngentian, and this was given to the extent of about 8 grains a day in the\r\nfood. As an assistance to the treatment, with the object of killing any\r\nembryos in the drinking water, fifteen grains of salicylate of soda was\r\nmixed with a pint and three-quarters of water. So successful was this, that\r\non M. De Rothschild's preserves at Rambouillet, where a few days before\r\ngapes were so virulent that 1,200 pheasants were found dead every morning,\r\nit succeeded in stopping the epidemic in a few days. But to complete the\r\nmatter, M. Mégnin adds that it is always advisable to disinfect the soil of\r\npreserves. For this purpose, the best means of destroying any eggs or\r\nembryos it may contain is to water the ground with a solution of sulphuric\r\nacid, in the proportion of a pennyweight to three pints of water, and also\r\nbirds that die of the disease should be deeply buried in lime.\r\n\r\nFumigation with carbolic acid is an undoubted cure, but then it is a\r\ndangerous one, and unless very great care is taken in killing the worms,\r\nthe bird is killed also. Thus many find this a risky method, and prefer\r\nsome other. Lime is found to be a valuable remedy. In some districts of\r\nEngland, where lime-kilns abound, it is a common thing to take children\r\ntroubled with whooping-cough there. Standing in the smoke arising from the\r\nkilns, they are compelled to breathe it. This dislodges the phlegm in the\r\nthroat, and they are enabled to get rid of it. Except near lime-kilns, this\r\ncannot be done to chickens, but fine slaked lime can be used, either alone\r\nor mixed with powdered sulphur, two parts of the former to one of the\r\nlatter. The air is charged with this fine powder, and the birds, breathing\r\nit, cough, and thus get rid of the worms, which are stupefied by the lime,\r\nand do not retain so firm a hold on the throat. An apparatus has recently\r\nbeen introduced to spread this lime powder. It is in the form of an\r\nair-fan, with a pointed nozzle, which is put just within the coop at night,\r\nwhen the birds are all within. The powder is already in a compartment made\r\nfor it, and by the turning of a handle, it is driven through the nozzle,\r\nand the air within the coop charged with it. There is no waste of powder,\r\nnor any fear that it will not be properly distributed. Experienced pheasant\r\nand poultry breeders state that by the use of this once a week, gapes are\r\neffectually prevented. In this case, also, I shall be glad to learn the\r\nresult if tried.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN BEALE.\r\n\r\nH----, Eng., Aug. 1.\r\n\r\n--_Country Gentleman_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOLPERT'S METHOD OF ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF CARBONIC ACID IN THE AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a large number of processes and apparatus for estimating the\r\namount of carbonic acid in the air. Some of them, such as those of\r\nRegnault, Reiset, the Montsouris observers (Fig. 1), and Brand, are\r\naccurate analytical instruments, and consequently quite delicate, and not\r\neasily manipulated by hygienists of middling experience. Others are less\r\ncomplicated, and also less exact, but still require quite a troublesome\r\nmanipulation--such, for example, as the process of Pettenkofer, as modified\r\nby Fodor, that of Hesse, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPARATUS FOR ESTIMATING THE CARBONIC ACID OF THE AIR.\r\nFIG. 1.--Montsouris Apparatus. FIG. 2.--Smith's Minimetric Apparatus. FIG.\r\n3.--Bertin-Sans Apparatus. FIG. 4.--Bubbling Glass. FIG. 5.--Pipette. FIG.\r\n6.--Arrangement of the U-shaped Tube. FIG. 7.--Wolpert's Apparatus.]\r\n\r\nHygienists have for some years striven to obtain some very simple apparatus\r\n(rather as an indicator than an analytical instrument) that should permit\r\nit to be quickly ascertained whether the degree of impurity of a place was\r\nincompatible with health, and in what proportion it was so. It is from such\r\nefforts that have resulted the processes of Messrs. Smith. Lunge,\r\nBertin-Sans, and the apparatus of Prof. Wolpert (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\nIt is of the highest interest to ascertain the proportion of carbonic acid\r\nin the air, and especially in that of inhabited places, since up to the\r\npresent this is the best means of finding out how much the air that we are\r\nbreathing is polluted, and whether there is sufficient ventilation or not.\r\nExperiment has, in fact, demonstrated that carbonic acid increases in the\r\nair of inhabited rooms in the same way as do those organic matters which\r\nare difficult of direct estimation. Although a few ten-thousandths more of\r\ncarbonic acid in our air cannot of themselves endanger us, yet they have on\r\nanother hand a baneful significance, and, indeed, the majority of\r\nhygienists will not tolerate more than six ten-millionths of this element\r\nin the air of dwellings, and some of them not more than five\r\nten-millionths.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid readily betrays its presence through solutions of the\r\nalkaline earths such as baryta and chalk, in which its passage produces an\r\ninsoluble carbonate, and consequently makes the liquid turbid. If, then,\r\none has prepared a solution of baryta or lime, of which a certain volume is\r\nmade turbid by the passage of a likewise known volume of CO_{2}, it will be\r\neasy to ascertain how much CO_{2} a certain air contains, from the volume\r\nof the latter that it will be necessary to pass through the basic solution\r\nin order to obtain the amount of turbidity that has been taken as a\r\nstandard. The problem consists in determining the minimum of air required\r\nto make the known solution turbid. Hence the name \"minimetric estimation,\"\r\nthat has been given to this process. Prof. Lescoeur has had the goodness to\r\nconstruct for me a Smith's minimetric apparatus (Fig. 2) with the ingenious\r\nimprovements that have been made in it by Mr. Fischli, assistant to Prof.\r\nWeil, of Zurich. I have employed it frequently, and I use it every year in\r\nmy lectures. I find it very practical, provided one has got accustomed to\r\nusing it. It is, at all events, of much simpler manipulation than that of\r\nBertin-Sans, although the accuracy of the latter may be greater (Figs. 3,\r\n4, 5, and 6). But it certainly has more than one defect, and some of the\r\nfaults that have been found with it are quite serious. The worst of these\r\nconsists in the difficulty of catching the exact moment at which the\r\nturbidity of the basic liquid is at the proper point for arresting the\r\noperation. In addition to this capital defect, it is regrettable that it is\r\nnecessary to shake the flask that contains the solution after every\r\ninsufflation of air, and also that the play of the valves soon becomes\r\nimperfect. Finally, Mr. Wolpert rightly sees one serious drawback to the\r\nuse of baryta in an apparatus that has to be employed in schools, among\r\nchildren, and that is that this substance is poisonous. This gentleman\r\ntherefore replaces the solution of baryta by water saturated with lime,\r\nwhich costs almost nothing, and the preparation of which is exceedingly\r\nsimple. Moreover, it is a harmless agent.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of two parts. The first of these is a glass tube\r\nclosed at one end, and 12 cm. in length by 12 mm. in diameter. Its bottom\r\nis of porcelain, and bears on its inner surface the date 1882 in black\r\ncharacters. Above, and at the level that corresponds to a volume of three\r\ncubic centimeters, there is a black line which serves as an invariable\r\ndatum point. A rubber bulb of twenty-eight cubic centimeters capacity is\r\nfixed to a tube which reaches its bottom, and is flanged at the other\r\nextremity (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\nThe operation is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe saturated, but limpid, solution of lime is poured into the first tube\r\nup to the black mark, the tube of the air bulb is introduced into the lime\r\nwater in such a way that its orifice shall be in perfect contact with the\r\nbottom of the other tube, and then, while the bulb is held between the fore\r\nand middle fingers of the upturned hand, one presses slowly with the thumb\r\nupon its bottom so as to expel all the air that it contains. This air\r\nenters the lime-water bubble by bubble. After this the tube is removed from\r\nthe water, and the bulb is allowed to fill with air, and the same maneuver\r\nis again gone through with. This is repeated until the figures 1882, looked\r\nat from above, cease to be clearly visible, and disappear entirely after\r\nthe contents of the tube have been vigorously shaken.\r\n\r\nThe measures are such that the turbidity supervenes at once if the air in\r\nthe bulb contains twenty thousandths of CO_{2}. If it becomes necessary to\r\ninject the contents of the bulb into the water twice, it is clear that the\r\nproportion is only ten thousandths; and if it requires ten injections the\r\nair contains ten times less CO_{2} than that having twenty thousandths, or\r\nonly two per cent. A table that accompanies the apparatus has been\r\nconstructed upon this basis, and does away with the necessity of making\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nAn air that contained ten thousandths of CO_{2}, or even five, would be\r\nalmost as deleterious, in my opinion, as one of two per cent. It is of no\r\naccount, then, to know the proportions intermediate to these round numbers.\r\nYet it is possible, if the case requires it, to obtain an indication\r\nbetween two consecutive figures of the scale by means of another bulb whose\r\ncapacity is only half that of the preceding. Thus, two injections of the\r\nlarge bulb, followed by one of the small, or two and a half injections,\r\ncorrespond to a richness of 8 thousandths of CO_{2}; and 5½ to 3.6\r\nthousandths. This half-bulb serves likewise for another purpose. From the\r\nmoment that the large bulb makes the lime-water turbid with an air\r\ncontaining two per cent. of CO_{2}, it is clear that the small one can\r\ncause the same turbidity only with air twice richer in CO_{2}, _i.e._, of\r\nfour per cent.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, although it makes no pretensions to extreme accuracy, is\r\ncapable of giving valuable information. The table that accompanies it is\r\narranged for a temperature of 17° and a pressure of 740 mm. But different\r\nmeteorological conditions do not materially alter the results. Thus, with\r\n10° less it would require thirty-one injections instead of thirty, and\r\nCO_{2} would be 0.64 per 1,000 instead of 0.66; and with 10° more, thirty\r\ninjections instead of thirty one.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is contained in a box that likewise holds a bottle of\r\nlime-water sufficient for a dozen analyses, the table of proportions of\r\nCO_{2}, and the apparatus for cleaning the tubes. The entire affair is\r\nsmall enough to be carried in the pocket.--_J. Arnould, in Science et\r\nNature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[NATURE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE OF THE VETTOR PISANI.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing how much _Nature_ is read by all the naturalists of the world, I\r\nsend these few lines, which I hope will be of some interest.\r\n\r\nThe Italian R.N. corvette Vettor Pisani left Italy in April, 1882, for a\r\nvoyage round the world with the ordinary commission of a man-of-war. The\r\nMinister of Marine, wishing to obtain scientific results, gave orders to\r\nform, when possible, a marine zoological collection, and to carry on\r\nsurveying, deep-sea soundings, and abyssal thermometrical measurements. The\r\nofficers of the ship received their different scientific charges, and Prof.\r\nDohrn, director of the Zoological Station at Naples, gave to the writer\r\nnecessary instructions for collecting and preserving sea animals.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1882 the Vettor Pisani visited the Straits of Magellan, the\r\nPatagonian Channels, and Chonos and Chiloe islands; we surveyed the Darwin\r\nChannel, and following Dr. Cuningham's work (who visited these places on\r\nboard H.M.S. Nassau), we made a numerous collection of sea animals by\r\ndredging and fishing along the coasts.\r\n\r\nWhile fishing for a big shark in the Gulf of Panama during the stay of our\r\nship in Taboga Island, one day in February, with a dead clam, we saw\r\nseveral great sharks some miles from our anchorage. In a short time several\r\nboats with natives went to sea, accompanied by two of the Vettor Pisani's\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nHaving wounded one of these animals in the lateral part of the belly, we\r\nheld him with lines fixed to the spears; he then began to describe a very\r\nnarrow curve, and irritated by the cries of the people that were in the\r\nboats, ran off with a moderate velocity. To the first boat, which held the\r\nlines just mentioned, the other boats were fastened, and it was a rather\r\nstrange emotion to feel ourselves towed by the monster for more than three\r\nhours with a velocity that proved to be two miles per hour. One of the\r\nboats was filled with water. At last the animal was tired by the great loss\r\nof blood, and the boats assembled to haul in the lines and tow the shark on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nWith much difficulty the nine boats towed the animal alongside the Vettor\r\nPisani to have him hoisted on board, but it was impossible on account of\r\nhis colossal dimensions. But as it was high water we went toward a sand\r\nbeach with the animal, and we had him safely stranded at night.\r\n\r\nWith much care were inspected the mouth, the nostrils, the ears, and all\r\nthe body, but no parasite was found. The eyes were taken out and prepared\r\nfor histological study. The set of teeth was all covered by a membrane that\r\nsurrounded internally the lips; the teeth are very little, and almost in a\r\nrudimental state. The mouth, instead of opening in the inferior part of the\r\nhead, as in common sharks, was at the extremity of the head; the jaws\r\nhaving the same bend.\r\n\r\nCutting the animal on one side of the backbone we met (1) a compact layer\r\nof white fat 20 centimeters deep; (2) the cartilaginous ribs covered with\r\nblood vessels; (3) a stratum of flabby, stringy, white muscle, 60\r\ncentimeters high, apparently in adipose degeneracy; (4) the stomach.\r\n\r\nBy each side of the backbone he had three chamferings, or flutings, that\r\nwere distinguished by inflected interstices. The color of the back was\r\nbrown with yellow spots that became close and small toward the head, so as\r\nto be like marble spots. The length of the shark was 8.90 m. from the mouth\r\nto the _pinna caudalis_ extremity, the greatest circumference 6.50 m., and\r\n2.50 m. the main diameter (the outline of the two projections is made for\r\ngiving other dimensions).\r\n\r\nThe natives call the species _Tintoreva_, and the most aged of the village\r\nhad only once before fished such an animal, but smaller. While the animal\r\nwas on board we saw several _Remora_ about a foot long drop from his mouth;\r\nit was proved that these fish lived fixed to the palate, and one of them\r\nwas pulled off and kept in the zoological collection of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe Vettor Pisani has up the present visited Gibraltar, Cape Verde Islands,\r\nPernambuco, Rio Janeiro, Monte Video, Valparaiso, many ports of Peru,\r\nGuayaquil, Panama, Galapagos Islands, and all the collections were up to\r\nthis sent to the Zoological Station at Naples to be studied by the\r\nnaturalists. By this time the ship left Callao for Honolulu, Manila, Hong\r\nKong, and, as the Challenger had not crossed the Pacific Ocean in these\r\ndirections, we made several soundings and deep-sea thermometrical\r\nmeasurements from Callao to Honolulu. Soundings are made with a steel wire\r\n(Thompson system) and a sounding-rod invented by J. Palumbo, captain of the\r\nship. The thermometer employed is a Negretti and Zambra deep-sea\r\nthermometer, improved by Captain Maguaghi (director of the Italian R.N.\r\nHydrographic Office).\r\n\r\nWith the thermometer wire has always been sent down a tow-net which opens\r\nand closes automatically, also invented by Captain Palumbo. This tow-net\r\nhas brought up some little animals that I think are unknown.\r\n\r\nG. CHIERCHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonolulu July 1.\r\n\r\nThe shark captured by the Vettor Pisani in the Gulf of Panama is _Rhinodon\r\ntypicus_, probably the most gigantic fish in existence. Mr. Swinburne Ward,\r\nformerly commissioner of the Seychelles, has informed me that it attains to\r\na length of 50 feet or more, which statement was afterward confirmed by\r\nProf. E.P. Wright. Originally described by Sir A. Smith from a single\r\nspecimen which was killed in the neighborhood of Cape Town, this species\r\nproved to be of not uncommon occurrence in the Seychelles Archipelago,\r\nwhere it is known by the name of \"Chagrin.\" Quite recently Mr. Haly\r\nreported the capture of a specimen on the coast of Ceylon. Like other large\r\nsharks (_Carcharodon rondeletii, Selache maxima_, etc.), Rhinodon has a\r\nwide geographical range, and the fact of its occurrence on the Pacific\r\ncoast of America, previously indicated by two sources, appears now to be\r\nfully established. T. Gill in 1865 described a large shark known in the\r\nGulf of California by the name of \"Tiburon ballenas\" or whale-shark, as a\r\ndistinct genus--_Micristodus punctatus_--which, in my opinion, is the same\r\nfish. And finally, Prof. W. Nation examined in 1878 a specimen captured at\r\nCallao. Of this specimen we possess in the British Museum a portion of the\r\ndental plate. The teeth differ in no respect from those of a Seychelles\r\nChagrin; they are conical, sharply pointed, recurved, with the base of\r\nattachment swollen. Making no more than due allowance for such variations\r\nin the descriptions by different observers as are unavoidable in accounts\r\nof huge creatures examined by some in a fresh, by others in a preserved,\r\nstate, we find the principal characteristics identical in all these\r\naccounts, viz.: the form of the body, head, and snout, relative\r\nmeasurements, position of mouth, nostrils, and eyes, dentition, peculiar\r\nridges on the side of the trunk and tail, coloration, etc. I have only to\r\nadd that this shark is stated to be of mild disposition and quite harmless.\r\nIndeed, the minute size of its teeth has led to the belief in the\r\nSeychelles that it is a herbivorous fish, which, however, is not probable.\r\n\r\nALBERT GUNTHER.\r\n\r\nNatural History Museum, _July 30_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREELY ARCTIC EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREELY ARCTIC EXPEDITION.--THE FARTHEST POINT NORTH.]\r\n\r\nSome account has been given of the American Meteorological Expedition,\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant, now Major, Greely, of the United States Army, in\r\nthe farthest north channels, beyond Smith Sound, that part of the Arctic\r\nregions where the British Polar expedition, in May, 1876, penetrated to\r\nwithin four hundred geographical miles of the North Pole. The American\r\nexpedition, in 1883, succeeded in getting four miles beyond, this being\r\neffected by a sledge party traveling over the snow from Fort Conger, the\r\nname they had given to their huts erected on the western shore near\r\nDiscovery Cove, in Lady Franklin Sound. The farthest point reached, on May\r\n18, was in latitude 83 deg. 24 min. N.; longitude 40 deg. 46 min. W., on\r\nthe Greenland coast. The sledge party was commanded by Lieutenant Lockwood,\r\nand the following particulars are supplied by Sergeant Brainerd, who\r\naccompanied Lieutenant Lockwood on the expedition. During their sojourn in\r\nthe Arctic regions the men were allowed to grow the full beard, except\r\nunder the mouth, where it was clipped short. They wore knitted mittens, and\r\nover these heavy seal-skin mittens were drawn, connected by a tanned\r\nseal-skin string that passed over the neck, to hold them when the hands\r\nwere slipped out. Large tanned leather pockets were fastened outside the\r\njackets, and in very severe weather jerseys were sometimes worn over the\r\njackets for greater protection against the intense cold. On the sledge\r\njourneys the dogs were harnessed in a fan-shaped group to the traces, and\r\nwere never run tandem. In traveling, the men were accustomed to hold on to\r\nthe back of the sledge, never going in front of the team, and often took\r\noff their heavy overcoats and threw them on the load. When taking\r\nobservations with the sextant, Lieutenant Lockwood generally reclined on\r\nthe snow, while Sergeant Brainerd called time and made notes, as shown in\r\nour illustration. When further progress northward was barred by open water,\r\nand the party almost miraculously escaped drifting into the Polar sea,\r\nLieutenant Lockwood erected, at the highest point of latitude reached by\r\ncivilized man, a pyramidal-shaped cache of stones, six feet square at the\r\nbase, and eight or nine feet high. In a little chamber about a foot square\r\nhalf-way to the apex, and extending to the center of the pile, he placed a\r\nself-recording spirit thermometer, a small tin cylinder containing records\r\nof the expedition, and then sealed up the aperture with a closely fitting\r\nstone. The cache was surmounted with a small American flag made by Mrs.\r\nGreely, but there were only thirteen stars, the number of the old\r\nrevolutionary flag. From the summit of Lockwood Island, the scene presented\r\nin our illustration, 2,000 feet above the sea, Lieutenant Lockwood was\r\nunable to make out any land to the north or the northwest. \"The awful\r\npanorama of the Arctic which their elevation spread out before them made a\r\nprofound impression upon the explorers. The exultation which was natural to\r\nthe achievement which they found they had accomplished was tempered by the\r\nreflections inspired by the sublime desolation of that stern and silent\r\ncoast and the menace of its unbroken solitude. Beyond to the eastward was\r\nthe interminable defiance of the unexplored coast--black, cold, and\r\nrepellent. Below them lay the Arctic Ocean, buried beneath frozen chaos. No\r\nwords can describe the confusion of this sea of ice--the hopeless asperity\r\nof it, the weariness of its torn and tortured surface. Only at the remote\r\nhorizon did distance and the fallen snow mitigate its roughness and soften\r\nits outlines; and beyond it, in the yet unattainable recesses of the great\r\ncircle, they looked toward the Pole itself. It was a wonderful sight, never\r\nto be forgotten, and in some degree a realization of the picture that\r\nastronomers conjure to themselves when the moon is nearly full, and they\r\nlook down into the great plain which is called the Ocean of Storms, and\r\nwatch the shadows of sterile and airless peaks follow a slow procession\r\nacross its silver surface.\"--_Illustrated London News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NILE EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHALER GIG FOR THE NILE.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the authorities had finally made up their minds to send a\r\nflotilla of boats to Cairo for the relief of Khartoum, not a moment was\r\nlost in issuing orders to the different shipbuilding contractors for the\r\ncompletion, with the utmost dispatch, of the 400 \"whaler-gigs\" for service\r\non the Nile. They are light-looking boats, built of white pine, and weigh\r\neach about 920 lb., that is without the gear, and are supposed to carry\r\nfour tons of provisions, ammunition, and camp appliances, the food being\r\nsufficient for 100 days. The crew will number twelve men, soldiers and\r\nsailors, the former rowing, while the latter (two) will attend the helm.\r\nEach boat will be fitted with two lug sails, which can be worked reefed, so\r\nas to permit an awning to be fitted underneath for protection to the men\r\nfrom the sun. As is well known, the wind blows for two or three months\r\nalternately up and down the Nile, and the authorities expect the flotilla\r\nwill have the advantage of a fair wind astern for four or five days at the\r\nleast. On approaching the Cataracts, the boats will be transported on\r\nwooden rollers over the sand to the next level for relaunching.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPER TIME FOR CUTTING TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Oregonian:_\r\n\r\nBelieving that any ideas relating to this matter will be of some interest\r\nto your readers in this heavily-timbered region, I therefore propose giving\r\nyou my opinion and conclusions arrived at after having experimented upon\r\nthe cutting and use of timber for various purposes for a number of years\r\nhere upon the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nThis, we are all well aware, is a very important question, and one very\r\ndifficult to answer, since it requires observation and experiment through a\r\ncourse of many years to arrive at any definite conclusion; and it is a\r\nquestion too upon which even at the present day there exists a great\r\ndifference of opinion among men who, being engaged in the lumber business,\r\nare thereby the better qualified to form an opinion.\r\n\r\nMany articles have been published in the various papers of the country upon\r\nthis question for the past thirty years, but in all cases an opinion only\r\nhas been given, which, at the present day, such is the advance and higher\r\ndevelopment of the intellectual faculties of man, that a mere opinion upon\r\nany question without sufficient and substantial reasons to back it is of\r\nlittle value.\r\n\r\nMy object in writing this is not simply to give an opinion, but how and the\r\nmethods used by which I adopted such conclusions, as well also as the\r\nreasons why timber is more durable and better when cut at a certain season\r\nof the year than when cut at any other.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my investigations of this question for the past thirty\r\nyears, I have asked the opinion of a great many persons who have been\r\nengaged in the lumber business in various States of the Union, from Maine\r\nto Wisconsin, and they all agree upon one point, viz., that the winter time\r\nis the proper time for cutting timber, although none has ever been able to\r\ngive a reason why, only the fact that such was the case, and therefore\r\ndrawing the inference that it was the proper time when timber should be\r\ncut; and so it is, for one reason only, however, and that is the\r\nconvenience for handling or moving timber upon the snow and ice.\r\n\r\nIt was while engaged in the business of mining in the mountains of\r\nCalifornia in early days, and having occasion to work often among timber,\r\nin removing stumps, etc., it was while so engaged that I noticed one\r\npeculiar fact, which was this--that the stumps of some trees which had been\r\ncut but two or three years had decayed, while others of the same size and\r\nvariety of pine which had been cut the same year were as sound and firm as\r\nwhen first cut. This seemed strange to me, and I found upon inquiry of old\r\nlumbermen who had worked among timber all their lives, that it was strange\r\nto them also, and they could offer no explanation; and it was the\r\ninvestigation of this singular fact that led me to experiment further upon\r\nthe problem of cutting timber.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until many years after, and when engaged in clearing\r\nland for farming purposes, that I made the discovery why some stumps should\r\ndecay sooner than others of the same size and variety, even when cut a few\r\nmonths afterward.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to clear several acres of land which was covered with a very\r\ndense growth of young pines from two to six inches in diameter (this work\r\nfor certain reasons is usually done in the winter). The young trees, not\r\nbeing suitable for fuel, are thrown into piles and burned upon the ground.\r\nSuch land, therefore, on account of the stumps is very difficult to plow,\r\nas the stumps do not decay for three or four years, while most of the\r\nlarger ones remain sound even longer.\r\n\r\nBut, for the purpose of experimenting, I cleaned a few acres of ground in\r\nthe spring, cutting them in May and June. I trimmed the poles, leaving them\r\nupon the ground, and when seasoned hauled them to the house for fuel, and\r\nfound that for cooking or heating purposes they were almost equal to oak;\r\nand it was my practice for many years afterward to cut these young pines in\r\nMay or June for winter fuel.\r\n\r\nI found also that the stumps, instead of remaining sound for any length of\r\ntime, decayed so quickly that they could all be plowed up the following\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nFrom which facts I draw these conclusions: that if in the cutting of timber\r\nthe main object is to preserve the stumps, cut your trees in the fall or\r\nwinter; but if the value of the timber is any consideration, cut your trees\r\nin the spring after the sap has ascended the tree, but before any growth\r\nhas taken place or new wood has been formed.\r\n\r\nI experimented for many years also in the cutting of timber for fencing,\r\nfence posts, etc., and with the same results. Those which were cut in the\r\nspring and set after being seasoned were the most durable, such timber\r\nbeing much lighter, tougher, and in all respects better for all variety of\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nHaving given some little idea of the manner in which I experimented, and\r\nthe conclusions arrived at as to the proper time when timber should be cut,\r\nI now propose to give what are, in my opinion, the reasons why timber cut\r\nin early summer is much better, being lighter, tougher and more durable\r\nthan if cut at any other time. Therefore, in order to do this it is\r\nnecessary first to explain the nature and value of the sap and the growth\r\nof a tree.\r\n\r\nWe find it to be the general opinion at present, as it perhaps has always\r\nbeen among lumbermen and those who work among timber, that the sap of a\r\ntree is an evil which must be avoided if possible, for it is this which\r\ncauses decay and destroys the life and good qualities of all wood when\r\nallowed to remain in it for an unusual length of time, but that this is a\r\nmistaken idea I will endeavor to show, not that the decay is due to the\r\nsap, but to the time when the tree was felled.\r\n\r\nWe find by experiment in evaporating a quantity of sap of the pine, that it\r\nis water holding in solution a substance of a gummy nature, being composed\r\nof albumen and other elementary matters, which is deposited within the\r\npores of the wood from the new growth of the tree; that these substances in\r\nsolution, which constitute the sap, and which promote the growth of the\r\ntree, should have a tendency to cause decay of the wood is an\r\nimpossibility. The injury results from the water only, and the improper\r\ntime of felling the tree.\r\n\r\nOf the process in which the sap promotes the growth of the tree, the\r\nscientist informs us that it is extracted from the soil, and flows up\r\nthrough the pores of the wood of the tree, where it is deposited upon the\r\nfiber, and by a peculiar process of nature the albumen forms new cells,\r\nwhich in process of formation crowd and push out from the center, thus\r\nconstituting the growth of the tree in all directions from center to\r\ncircumference. Consequently this new growth of wood, being composed\r\nprincipally of albumen, is of a soft, spongy nature, and under the proper\r\nconditions will decay very rapidly, which can be easily demonstrated by\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nHence, we must infer that the proper time for felling the tree is when the\r\nconditions are such that the rapid decay of a new growth of wood is\r\nimpossible; and this I have found by experiment to be in early summer,\r\nafter the sap has ascended the tree, but before any new growth of wood has\r\nbeen formed. The new growth of the previous season is now well matured, has\r\nbecome hard and firm, and will not decay. On the contrary, the tree being\r\ncut when such new growth has not well matured, decay soon takes place, and\r\nthe value of the timber is destroyed. The effect of this cutting and use of\r\ntimber under the wrong conditions can be seen all around us. In the timbers\r\nof the bridges, in the trestlework and ties of railroads and in the piling\r\nof the wharves will be found portions showing rapid decay, while other\r\nportions are yet firm and in sound condition.\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said in the explanation of this subject, but not wishing\r\nto extend the subject to an improper length, I will close. I would,\r\nhowever, say in conclusion that persons who have the opportunities and the\r\ninclination can verify the truth of a portion, at least, of what I have\r\nstated, in a simple manner and in a short time; for instance, by cutting\r\ntwo or three young fir or spruce saplings, say about six inches in\r\ndiameter, mark them when cut, and also mark the stumps by driving pegs\r\nmarked to correspond with the trees. Continue this monthly for the space of\r\nabout one year, and note the difference in the wood, which should be left\r\nout and exposed to the weather until seasoned.\r\n\r\nC.W.

I have at various times given it to growers,\r\nbut still I hear of difficulties. Procure a good sized bell-glass and an\r\nearthenware pan without any holes for drainage. Prepare a number of small\r\npots, all filled for sowing, place them inside the pan, and fit the glass\r\nover them, so that it takes all in easily. Take these filled small pots out\r\nof the pan, place them on the ground, and well water them with boiling\r\nwater to destroy all animal and vegetable life, and allow them to get\r\nperfectly cold; use a fine rose. Then taking each small pot separately, sow\r\nthe spores on the surface and label them; do this with the whole number,\r\nand then place them in the pan under the bell-glass. This had better be\r\ndone in a room, so that nothing foreign can grow inside. Having arranged\r\nthe pots and placed the glass over them, and which should fit down upon the\r\npan with ease, take a clean sponge, and tearing it up pack the pieces round\r\nthe outside of the glass, and touching the inner side of the pan all round.\r\nWater this with cold water, so that the sponge is saturated. Do this\r\nwhenever required, and always use water that has been boiled. At the end of\r\nsix weeks or so the prothallus will perhaps appear, certainly in a week or\r\ntwo more; perhaps from unforeseen circumstances not for three months.\r\nSlowly these will begin to show themselves as young ferns, and most\r\ninteresting it is to watch the results. As the ferns are gradually\r\nincreasing in size pass a small piece of slate under the edge of the\r\nbell-glass to admit air, and do this by very careful degrees, allowing more\r\nand more air to reach them. Never water overhead until the seedlings are\r\nacclimated and have perfect form as ferns, and even then water at the edges\r\nof the pots. In due time carefully prick out, and the task so interesting\r\nto watch is performed.--_The Garden_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE HISTORY OF VAUCHERIA.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Read before the San Francisco Microscopical Society, August 13,\r\nand furnished for publication in the _Press_.]\r\n\r\nBy A.H. BRECKENFELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly a century ago, Vaucher, the celebrated Genevan botanist, described a\r\nfresh water filamentous alga which he named _Ectosperma geminata_, with a\r\ncorrectness that appears truly remarkable when the imperfect means of\r\nobservation at his command are taken into consideration. His pupil, De\r\nCandolle, who afterward became so eminent a worker in the same field, when\r\npreparing his \"Flora of France,\" in 1805, proposed the name of _Vaucheria_\r\nfor the genus, in commemoration of the meritorious work of its first\r\ninvestigator. On March 12, 1826, Unger made the first recorded observation\r\nof the formation and liberation of the terminal or non-sexual spores of\r\nthis plant. Hassall, the able English botanist, made it the subject of\r\nextended study while preparing his fine work entitled \"A History of the\r\nBritish Fresh Water Algæ,\" published in 1845. He has given us a very\r\ngraphic description of the phenomenon first observed by Unger. In 1856\r\nPringsheim described the true sexual propagation by oospores, with such\r\nminuteness and accuracy that our knowledge of the plant can scarcely be\r\nsaid to have essentially increased since that time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROWTH OF THE ALGA, VAUCHERIA, UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\n_Vaucheria_ has two or three rather doubtful marine species assigned to it\r\nby Harvey, but the fresh water forms are by far the more numerous, and it\r\nis to some of these I would call your attention for a few moments this\r\nevening. The plant grows in densely interwoven tufts, these being of a\r\nvivid green color, while the plant is in the actively vegetative condition,\r\nchanging to a duller tint as it advances to maturity. Its habitat (with the\r\nexceptions above noted) is in freshwater--usually in ditches or slowly\r\nrunning streams. I have found it at pretty much all seasons of the year, in\r\nthe stretch of boggy ground in the Presidio, bordering the road to Fort\r\nPoint. The filaments attain a length of several inches when fully\r\ndeveloped, and are of an average diameter of 1/250 (0.004) inch. They\r\nbranch but sparingly, or not at all, and are characterized by consisting of\r\na single long tube or cell, not divided by septa, as in the case of the\r\ngreat majority of the filamentous algæ. These tubular filaments are\r\ncomposed of a nearly transparent cellulose wall, including an inner layer\r\nthickly studded with bright green granules of chlorophyl. This inner layer\r\nis ordinarily not noticeable, but it retracts from the outer envelope when\r\nsubjected to the action of certain reagents, or when immersed in a fluid\r\ndiffering in density from water, and it then becomes distinctly visible, as\r\nmay be seen in the engraving (Fig. 1). The plant grows rapidly and is\r\nendowed with much vitality, for it resists changes of temperature to a\r\nremarkable degree. _Vaucheria_ affords a choice hunting ground to the\r\nmicroscopist, for its tangled masses are the home of numberless infusoria,\r\nrotifers, and the minuter crustacea, while the filaments more advanced in\r\nage are usually thickly incrusted with diatoms. Here, too, is a favorite\r\nhaunt of the beautiful zoophytes, _Hydra vividis_ and _H. vulgaris_, whose\r\ndelicate tentacles may be seen gracefully waving in nearly every gathering.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTION IN VAUCHERIA.\r\n\r\nAfter the plant has attained a certain stage in its growth, if it be\r\nattentively watched, a marked change will be observed near the ends of the\r\nfilaments. The chlorophyl appears to assume a darker hue, and the granules\r\nbecome more densely crowded. This appearance increases until the extremity\r\nof the tube appears almost swollen. Soon the densely congregated granules\r\nat the extreme end will be seen to separate from the endochrome of the\r\nfilament, a clear space sometimes, but not always, marking the point of\r\ndivision. Here a septum or membrane appears, thus forming a cell whose\r\nlength is about three or four times its width, and whose walls completely\r\ninclose the dark green mass of crowded granules (Fig. 1, b). These contents\r\nare now gradually forming themselves into the spore or \"gonidium,\" as\r\nCarpenter calls it, in distinction from the true sexual spores, which he\r\nterms \"oospores.\" At the extreme end of the filament (which is obtusely\r\nconical in shape) the chlorophyl grains retract from the old cellulose\r\nwall, leaving a very evident clear space. In a less noticeable degree, this\r\nis also the case in the other parts of the circumference of the cell, and,\r\napparently, the granular contents have secreted a separate envelope\r\nentirely distinct from the parent filament. The grand climax is now rapidly\r\napproaching. The contents of the cell near its base are now so densely\r\nclustered as to appear nearly black (Fig. 1, c), while the upper half is of\r\na much lighter hue and the separate granules are there easily\r\ndistinguished, and, if very closely watched, show an almost imperceptible\r\nmotion. The old cellulose wall shows signs of great tension, its conical\r\nextremity rounding out under the slowly increasing pressure from within.\r\nSuddenly it gives way at the apex. At the same instant, the inclosed\r\ngonidium (for it is now seen to be fully formed) acquires a rotary motion,\r\nat first slow, but gradually increasing until it has gained considerable\r\nvelocity. Its upper portion is slowly twisted through the opening in the\r\napex of the parent wall, the granular contents of the lower end flowing\r\ninto the extruded portion in a manner reminding one of the flow of\r\nprotoplasm in a living amoeba. The old cell wall seems to offer\r\nconsiderable resistance to the escape of the gonidium, for the latter,\r\nwhich displays remarkable elasticity, is pinched nearly in two while\r\nforcing its way through, assuming an hour glass shape when about half out.\r\nThe rapid rotation of the spore continues during the process of emerging,\r\nand after about a minute it has fully freed itself (Fig 1, a). It\r\nimmediately assumes the form of an ellipse or oval, and darts off with\r\ngreat speed, revolving on its major axis as it does so. Its contents are\r\nnearly all massed in the posterior half, the comparatively clear portion\r\ninvariably pointing in advance. When it meets an obstacle, it partially\r\nflattens itself against it, then turns aside and spins off in a new\r\ndirection. This erratic motion is continued for usually seven or eight\r\nminutes. The longest duration I have yet observed was a little over nine\r\nand one-half minutes. Hassall records a case where it continued for\r\nnineteen minutes. The time, however, varies greatly, as in some cases the\r\nmotion ceases almost as soon as the spore is liberated, while in open\r\nwater, unretarded by the cover glass or other obstacles, its movements have\r\nbeen seen to continue for over two hours.\r\n\r\nThe motile force is imparted to the gonidium by dense rows of waving cilia\r\nwith which it is completely surrounded. Owing to their rapid vibration, it\r\nis almost impossible to distinguish them while the spore is in active\r\nmotion, but their effect is very plainly seen on adding colored pigment\r\nparticles to the water. By subjecting the cilia to the action of iodine,\r\ntheir motion is arrested, they are stained brown, and become very plainly\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nAfter the gonidium comes gradually to a rest its cilia soon disappear, it\r\nbecomes perfectly globular in shape, the inclosed granules distribute\r\nthemselves evenly throughout its interior, and after a few hours it\r\ngerminates by throwing out one, two, or sometimes three tubular\r\nprolongations, which become precisely like the parent filament (Fig 2).\r\n\r\nEminent English authorities have advanced the theory that the ciliated\r\ngonidium of _Vaucheria_ is in reality a densely crowded aggregation of\r\nbiciliated zoospores, similar to those found in many other confervoid algæ.\r\nAlthough this has by no means been proved, yet I cannot help calling the\r\nattention of the members of this society to a fact which I think strongly\r\nbears out the said theory: While watching a gathering of _Vaucheria_ one\r\nmorning when the plant was in the gonidia-forming condition (which is\r\nusually assumed a few hours after daybreak), I observed one filament, near\r\nthe end of which a septum had formed precisely as in the case of ordinary\r\nfilaments about to develop a spore. But, instead of the terminal cell being\r\nfilled with the usual densely crowded cluster of dark green granules\r\nconstituting the rapidly forming spore, it contained hundreds of actively\r\nmoving, nearly transparent zoospores, _and nothing else_. Not a single\r\nchlorophyl granule was to be seen. It is also to be noted as a significant\r\nfact, that the cellulose wall was _intact_ at the apex, instead of showing\r\nthe opening through which in ordinary cases the gonidium escapes. It would\r\nseem to be a reasonable inference, I think, based upon the theory above\r\nstated, that in this case the newly formed gonidium, unable to escape from\r\nits prison by reason of the abnormal strength of the cell wall, became\r\nafter a while resolved into its component zoospores.\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERS OF REPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nI very much regret that my descriptive powers are not equal to conveying a\r\nsufficient idea of the intensely absorbing interest possessed by this\r\nwonderful process of spore formation. I shall never forget the bright sunny\r\nmorning when for the first time I witnessed the entire process under the\r\nmicroscope, and for over four hours scarcely moved my eyes from the tube.\r\nTo a thoughtful observer I doubt if there is anything in the whole range of\r\nmicroscopy to exceed this phenomenon in point of startling interest. No\r\nwonder that its first observer published his researches under the caption\r\nof \"The Plant at the Moment of becoming an Animal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF OTHER SPORES.\r\n\r\nThe process of spore formation just described, it will be seen, is entirely\r\nnon-sexual, being simply a vegetative process, analogous to the budding of\r\nhigher plants, and the fission of some of the lower plants and animals.\r\n_Vaucheria_ has, however, a second and far higher mode of reproduction,\r\nviz., by means of fertilized cells, the true oospores, which, lying dormant\r\nas resting spores during the winter, are endowed with new life by the\r\nrejuvenating influences of spring. Their formation may be briefly described\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nWhen _Vaucheria_ has reached the proper stage in its life cycle, slight\r\nswellings appear here and there on the sides of the filament. Each of these\r\nslowly develops into a shape resembling a strongly curved horn. This\r\nbecomes the organ termed the _antheridium_, from its analogy in function to\r\nthe anther of flowering plants. While this is in process of growth,\r\npeculiar oval capsules or sporangia (usually 2 to 5 in number) are formed\r\nin close proximity to the antheridium. In some species both these organs\r\nare sessile on the main filament, in others they appear on a short pedicel\r\n(Figs. 3 and 4). The upper part of the antheridium becomes separated from\r\nthe parent stem by a septum, and its contents are converted into ciliated\r\nmotile antherozoids. The adjacent sporangia also become cut off by septa,\r\nand the investing membrane, when mature, opens: it a beak-like\r\nprolongation, thus permitting the inclosed densely congregated green\r\ngranules to be penetrated by the antherozoids which swarm from the\r\nantheridium at the same time. After being thus fertilized the contents of\r\nthe sporangium acquire a peculiar oily appearance, of a beautiful emerald\r\ncolor, an exceedingly tough but transparent envelope is secreted, and thus\r\nis constituted the fully developed oospore, the beginner of a new\r\ngeneration of the plant. After the production of this oospore the parent\r\nfilament gradually loses its vitality and slowly decays.\r\n\r\nThe spore being thus liberated, sinks to the bottom. Its brilliant hue has\r\nfaded and changed to a reddish brown, but after a rest of about three\r\nmonths (according to Pringsheim, who seems to be the only one who has ever\r\nfollowed the process of oospore formation entirely through), the spore\r\nsuddenly assumes its original vivid hue and germinates into a young\r\n_Vaucheria_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARM OF MICROSCOPICAL STUDY.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the account of my very imperfect attempt to trace the life\r\nhistory of a lowly plant. Its study has been to me a source of ever\r\nincreasing pleasure, and has again demonstrated how our favorite instrument\r\nreveals phenomena of most absorbing interest in directions where the\r\nunaided eye finds but little promise. In walking along the banks of the\r\nlittle stream, where, half concealed by more pretentious plants, our humble\r\n_Vaucheria_ grows, the average passer by, if he notices it at all, sees but\r\na tangled tuft of dark green \"scum.\" Yet, when this is examined under the\r\nmagic tube, a crystal cylinder, closely set with sparkling emeralds, is\r\nrevealed. And although so transparent, so apparently simple in structure\r\nthat it does not seem possible for even the finest details to escape our\r\nsearch, yet almost as we watch it mystic changes appear. We see the bright\r\ngreen granules, impelled by an unseen force, separate and rearrange\r\nthemselves in new formations. Strange outgrowths from the parent filament\r\nappear. The strange power we call \"life,\" doubly mysterious when manifested\r\nin an organism so simple as this, so open to our search, seems to challenge\r\nus to discover its secret, and, armed with our glittering lenses and our\r\nflashing stands of exquisite workmanship, we search intently, but in vain.\r\nAnd yet _not_ in vain, for we are more than recompensed by the wondrous\r\nrevelations beheld and the unalloyed pleasures enjoyed, through the study\r\nof even the unpretentious _Vaucheria_.\r\n\r\nThe amplification of the objects in the engravings is about 80 diameters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE CAMPHOR--ITS PREPARATION, EXPERIMENTS, AND ANALYSIS OF THE\r\nCAMPHOR OIL.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From the Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry.]\r\n\r\nBy H. OISHI. (Communicated by Kakamatsa.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURUS CAMPHORA, or \"kusunoki,\" as it is called in Japan, grows mainly in\r\nthose provinces in the islands Shikobu and Kinshin, which have the southern\r\nsea coast. It also grows abundantly in the province of Kishu.\r\n\r\nThe amount of camphor varies according to the age of the tree. That of a\r\nhundred years old is tolerably rich in camphor. In order to extract the\r\ncamphor, such a tree is selected; the trunk and large stems are cut into\r\nsmall pieces, and subjected to distillation with steam.\r\n\r\nAn iron boiler of 3 feet in diameter is placed over a small furnace, the\r\nboiler being provided with an iron flange at the top. Over this flange a\r\nwooden tub is placed, which is somewhat narrowed at the top, being 1 foot 6\r\ninches in the upper, and 2 feet 10 inches in the lower diameter, and 4 feet\r\nin height. The tub has a false bottom for the passage of steam from the\r\nboiler beneath. The upper part of the tub is connected with a condensing\r\napparatus by means of a wooden or bamboo pipe. The condenser is a flat\r\nrectangular wooden vessel, which is surrounded with another one containing\r\ncold water. Over the first is placed still another trough of the same\r\ndimensions, into which water is supplied to cool the vessel at the top.\r\nAfter the first trough has been filled with water, the latter flows into\r\nthe next by means of a small pipe attached to it. In order to expose a\r\nlarge surface to the vapors, the condensing trough is fitted internally\r\nwith a number of vertical partitions, which are open at alternate ends, so\r\nthat the vapors may travel along the partitions in the trough from one end\r\nto the other. The boiler is filled with water, and 120 kilogrammes of\r\nchopped pieces of wood are introduced into the tub, which is then closed\r\nwith a cover, cemented with clay, so as to make it air-tight. Firing is\r\nthen begun; the steam passes into the tub, and thus carries the vapors of\r\ncamphor and oil into the condenser, in which the camphor solidifies, and\r\nis mixed with the oil and condensed water. After twenty-four hours the\r\ncharge is taken out from the tub, and new pieces of the wood are\r\nintroduced, and distillation is conducted as before. The water in the\r\nboiler must be supplied from time to time. The exhausted wood is dried and\r\nused as fuel. The camphor and oil accumulated in the trough are taken out\r\nin five or ten days, and they are separated from each other by filtration.\r\nThe yield of the camphor and oil varies greatly in different seasons. Thus\r\nmuch more solid camphor is obtained in winter than in summer, while the\r\nreverse is the case with the oil. In summer, from 120 kilogrammes of the\r\nwood 2.4 kilogrammes, or 2 per cent. of the solid camphor are obtained in\r\none day, while in winter, from the same amount of the wood, 3 kilogrammes,\r\nor 2.5 per cent., of camphor are obtainable at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the oil obtained in ten days, _i.e._, from 10 charges or\r\n1,200 kilogrammes of the wood, in summer is about 18 liters, while in\r\nwinter it amounts only to 5-7 liters. The price of the solid camphor is\r\nat present about 1s. 1d. per kilo.\r\n\r\nThe oil contains a considerable amount of camphor in solution, which is\r\nseparated by a simple distillation and cooling. By this means about 20 per\r\ncent. of the camphor can be obtained from the oil. The author subjected the\r\noriginal oil to fractioned distillation, and examined different fractions\r\nseparately. That part of the oil which distilled between 180°-185° O. was\r\nanalyzed after repeated distillations. The following is the result:\r\n\r\n    Found.                Calculated as\r\n                          C_{10}H_{16}O.\r\n\r\nC = 78.87                     78.95\r\nH = 10.73                     10.52\r\nO = 10.40 (by difference)     10.52\r\n\r\nThe composition thus nearly agrees with that of the ordinary camphor.\r\n\r\nThe fraction between 178°-180° C., after three distillations, gave the\r\nfollowing analytical result:\r\n\r\nC = 86.95\r\nH = 12.28\r\n    -----\r\n    99.23\r\n\r\nIt appears from this result that the body is a hydrocarbon. The vapor\r\ndensity was then determined by V. Meyer's apparatus, and was found to be\r\n5.7 (air=1). The molecular weight of the compound is therefore 5.7 × 14.42\r\n× 2 = 164.4, which gives\r\n\r\nH = (164.4 × 12.28)/100 = 20.18\r\n                                   or C_{12}H_{20}\r\nC = (164.4 × 86.95)/100 = 11.81\r\n\r\nHence it is a hydrocarbon of the terpene series, having the general formula\r\nC^{n}H^(2n-4). From the above experiments it seems to be probable that\r\nthe camphor oil is a complicated mixture, consisting of hydrocarbons of\r\nterpene series, oxy-hydrocarbons isomeric with camphor, and other oxidized\r\nhydrocarbons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Application of the Camphor Oil_.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing property of the camphor oil, that it dissolves many\r\nresins, and mixes with drying oils, finds its application for the\r\npreparation of varnish. The author has succeeded in preparing various\r\nvarnishes with the camphor oil, mixed with different resins and oils.\r\nLampblack was also prepared by the author, by subjecting the camphor oil to\r\nincomplete combustion. In this way from 100 c.c. of the oil, about 13\r\ngrammes of soot of a very good quality were obtained. Soot or lampblack is\r\na very important material in Japan for making inks, paints, etc. If the\r\nmanufacture of lampblack from the cheap camphor oil is conducted on a large\r\nscale, it would no doubt be profitable. The following is the report on the\r\namount of the annual production of camphor in the province of Tosa up to\r\n1880:\r\n\r\n    Amount of Camphor produced.   Total Cost.\r\n\r\n1877.......... 504,000 kins.... 65,520 yen.\r\n1878.......... 519,000   \" .... 72,660  \"\r\n1879.......... 292,890   \" .... 74,481  \"\r\n1880.......... 192,837   \" .... 58,302  \"\r\n\r\n(1 yen = 2_s_. 9_d_.)\r\n(1 kin = 1-1/3lb.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUNSHINE RECORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcLeod's sunshine recorder consists of a camera fixed with its axis\r\nparallel to that of the earth, and with the lens northward. Opposite to the\r\nlens there is placed a round-bottomed flask, silvered inside. The solar\r\nrays reflected from this sphere pass through the lens, and act on the\r\nsensitive surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe construction of the instrument is illustrated by the subjoined cut, A\r\nbeing a camera supported at an inclination of 56 degrees with the horizon,\r\nand B the spherical flask silvered inside, while at D is placed the\r\nferro-prussiate paper destined to receive the solar impression. The dotted\r\nline, C, may represent the direction of the central solar ray at one\r\nparticular time, and it is easy to see how the sunlight reflected from the\r\nflask always passes through the lens. As the sun moves (apparently) in a\r\ncircle round the flask, the image formed by the lens moves round on the\r\nsensitive paper, forming an arc of a circle.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is obvious that any sensitive surface might be used in the\r\nMcLeod sunshine recorder, the inventor prefers at present to use the\r\nordinary ferro-prussiate paper as employed by engineers for copying\r\ntracings, as this paper can be kept for a considerable length of time\r\nwithout change, and the blue image is fixed by mere washing in water;\r\nanother advantage is the circumstance that a scale or set of datum lines\r\ncan be readily printed on the paper from an engraved block, and if the\r\nprinted papers be made to register properly in the camera, the records\r\nobtained will show at a glance the time at which sunshine commenced and\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nInstead of specially silvering a flask inside, it will be found convenient\r\nto make use of one of the silvered globes which are sold as Christmas tree\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive fluid for preparing the ferro-prussiate paper is made as\r\nfollows: One part by weight of ferricyanide of potassium (red prussiate) is\r\ndissolved in eight parts of water, and one part of ammonia-citrate of iron\r\nis added. This last addition must be made in the dark-room. A smooth-faced\r\npaper is now floated on the liquid and allowed to dry.--_Photo.

Immediately a\r\nstream of water fifteen feet high spurted out. Before the water could be\r\nshut off it had made a breach thirty feet long in the main line of track,\r\nso that the entire four tracks, sleepers, and roadbed at that point were\r\nwashed completely away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific papers\r\nheretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this office.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTerms of Subscription, $5 a Year.\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
