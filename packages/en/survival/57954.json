VEGETABLES or PLANTS are natural bodies endowed with organization and\r\nlife, but destitute of voluntary motion and sense; and BOTANY is that\r\nbranch of natural science which treats of their structure and functions,\r\nthe systematical arrangement and denomination of their several kinds, and\r\ntheir peculiar properties and uses.\r\n\r\n2. The principal parts of plants are the _root_; the _herb_ or plant\r\nitself; and the _fructification_, or flower and fruit.\r\n\r\n3.  As it is the sole object of this introduction to describe, in a concise\r\nmanner, the Linnæan arrangement of plants, for the purpose of explaining\r\nthe classification adopted in the present volume, the parts of\r\n_fructification_ only will be mentioned. These are the calyx, corolla,\r\nstamens, pistil, seed-vessel, seeds, and receptacle.\r\n\r\n4. The CALYX, or flower cup, is the green part which is situated\r\nimmediately beneath the blossom. In some plants this consists of one, in\r\nothers of several leaves; and it is frequently tubular, as in the\r\npolyanthus, and cowslip.\r\n\r\n5. The COROLLA, or blossom, is that coloured part of every flower on which\r\nits beauty principally depends. The leaves that compose it are denominated\r\n_petals_. Some flowers, as the convolvolus and campanula, have only a\r\nsingle petal; and others, as the rose and peony, have several petals.\r\n\r\n6.  In the centre of the flower there are two kinds of organs on which the\r\nfructification and re-production of the species more particularly depend.\r\nThese are the stamens, and the pistil. The STAMENS are slender,\r\nthread-like, substances, which surround the pistil. They each consist of a\r\n_filament_ or thread, and an _anther_ or summit: the latter contains, when\r\nripe, a fine dust or powder called _pollen_. This, though, to the naked\r\neye, it appears a fine powder, is so curiously formed, and is so various in\r\ndifferent plants, as to be an interesting object for the microscope. Each\r\ngrain of it is, commonly, a membranous bag, round or angular, rough or\r\nsmooth, which remains entire till it meets with any moisture; it then\r\nbursts and discharges a most subtile vapour.\r\n\r\n7.  The PISTIL is a prominent part, immediately in the centre of each\r\nflower, which adheres to the fruit, and is destined for the reception of\r\nthe pollen. Some flowers have only one pistil; others have two, three,\r\nfour, &c. and others more than can be easily counted.\r\n\r\n8. At the foot of the pistil is situated the _germen_. This, when grown to\r\nmaturity, has the name of pericarp or SEED-VESSEL, and is that part of the\r\nfructification which contains the seeds: whether it be a _capsule_ as in\r\nthe poppy, a _nut_ as the filbert, a _drupe_ as the plum, a _berry_ as the\r\ngooseberry, a _pome_ as the apple, a _pod_ as in the pea, or a _cone_ as of\r\nthe fir-tree.\r\n\r\n9. That part of every vegetable, which, at a certain state of maturity, is\r\nseparated from it, and contains the rudiments of a new plant, is called the\r\nSEED.\r\n\r\n10. The RECEPTACLE is the base which connects all the parts of\r\nfructification together, and on which they are seated. In some plants this\r\nis very conspicuous; and in none more so than the artichoke, of which it\r\nforms the eatable part, called the bottom.\r\n\r\n11. The Linnæan system of classification of plants is founded upon a\r\nsupposition that the stamens represent the _male_, and the pistils the\r\n_female_ parts of fructification. The whole vegetable creation has been\r\ndistributed, by Linnæus, into twenty-four _classes_. These are divided into\r\n_orders_, which are subdivided into _genera_ or tribes; and these genera\r\nare further divided into _species_ or individuals.\r\n\r\n12. Of the CLASSES the discriminating characters are taken from the number,\r\nconnexion, length, or situation of the stamens. In each of the first twenty\r\nclasses there are stamens and pistils in the same flower; in the\r\ntwenty-first class, the stamens and pistils are in distinct flowers on the\r\nsame plant; in the twenty-second, in distinct flowers on different plants;\r\nin the twenty-third, in the same flower and also in distinct flowers; and\r\nin the twenty-fourth class they are not at all discernible. Thus:\r\n\r\n  The stamens considered according to their:\r\n\r\n                                                               _Classes._\r\n                                       {One                1.

The characters of the ORDERS are most commonly taken from the number of\r\nthe pistils; but sometimes from circumstances relative to the stamens,\r\npistils, or seed. Those of the _first thirteen classes_ are taken from the\r\nnumber of pistils, thus:\r\n\r\n  Monogynia               1 pistil.\r\n  Digynia                 2 pistils.\r\n  Trigynia                3 pistils.\r\n  Tetragynia              4 pistils.\r\n  Pentagynia              5 pistils.\r\n  Hexagynia               6 pistils.\r\n  Heptagynia              7 pistils.\r\n  Octagynia               8 pistils.\r\n  Enneagynia              9 pistils.\r\n  Decagynia              10 pistils.\r\n  Dodecagynia      about 12 pistils.\r\n  Polygynia            many pistils.\r\n\r\nThe orders of the fourteenth class, _Didynamia_, are taken from the\r\nsituation of the seeds; and are\r\n\r\n  Gymnospermia         naked seeds.\r\n  Angiospermia         seeds in a capsule.\r\n\r\nThe orders of the fifteenth class, _Tetradynamia_, are formed from a\r\ndifference in the shape of the seed-vessel:\r\n\r\n  Siliculosa           a broad pod.\r\n  Siliquosa            a long pod.\r\n\r\nIn the classes _Monadelphia_, _Diadelphia_, _Polyadelphia_, and\r\n_Gynandria_, the orders are taken from the number of stamens:\r\n\r\n  Pentandria           5 stamens.\r\n  Hexandria, &c.       6 stamens, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth class, _Syngenesia_, the orders are taken from the\r\nstructure of the flower:\r\n\r\n  Polygamia æqualis,--all the florets alike.\r\n\r\n  Polygamia superflua,--the florets of the centre perfect or united; those\r\n  of the margin with pistils only, but all producing perfect seeds.\r\n\r\n  Polygamia frustranea,--the florets of the centre perfect or united; those\r\n  of the margin, in general, without either stamens or pistils.\r\n\r\n  Polygamia necessaria,--the florets of the centre with stamens only; those\r\n  of the margin with pistils only.\r\n\r\nThe classes _Monoecia_ and _Dicoecia_ take their orders from the number and\r\nother peculiarities of the stamens:\r\n\r\n  Monandria          1 stamen.\r\n  Diandria, &c.      2 stamens, &c.\r\n  Polyandria         7 stamens.\r\n  Monadelphia        stamens united into one set.\r\n  Polyadelphia       stamens united into several sets.\r\n  Gynandria          stamens upon the pistil.\r\n\r\nIn the class _Polygamia_ there are three orders:\r\n\r\n  Monoecia.    Dioecia.    Trioecia.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-fourth class, _Cryptogamia_, has five orders:\r\n\r\n  1. Ferns.\r\n  2. Mosses.\r\n  3. Liverworts.\r\n  4. Flags.\r\n  5. Mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThe Linnæan system is professedly artificial. Its sole aim (observes Sir J.\r\nE. Smith) is to help any one to learn the name and history of an unknown\r\nplant in the most easy and certain manner. This is done by first\r\ndetermining its class and order; after which its genus is to be made out,\r\nby comparing the parts of fructification with all the generic characters of\r\nthat order; and, finally, its species, by examining all the specific\r\ndefinitions of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--MONANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  14. _GINGER is the dried root of a somewhat reed-like plant_ (Amomum\r\n  zingiber, Pl. 1. Fig. 2.) _which grows wild in several parts of Asia; and\r\n  is much cultivated both in the East and West Indies._\r\n\r\n  _The flowers of the ginger plant issue from stalks distinct from those\r\n  which support the leaves, and form a kind of ear or spike, of beautiful\r\n  colours and very fragrant smell._\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of ginger is nearly similar to that of potatoes. The land\r\nis first well cleansed from weeds: it is then dug into trenches similar to\r\nthose which our gardeners make for celery; and the plants are set in these\r\ntrenches in March or April. They flower about September; and, in January or\r\nFebruary, when the stalks are withered, the roots are in a proper state to\r\nbe dug up.\r\n\r\nThese are prepared for use in two ways. When intended for what is called\r\n_white ginger_ they are picked, scraped, separately washed, and afterwards\r\ndried with great care, by exposure to the sun. For _black ginger_ they are\r\npicked, cleansed, immersed in boiling water, and dried. This process is\r\nmuch less laborious and expensive than the last, consequently the price of\r\nthe article is not so great. By boiling, the ginger loses a portion of its\r\nessential oil; and its black colour is owing to this.\r\n\r\nThe uses of ginger, both in medicine, and as a spice, are numerous and well\r\nknown. In the West Indies this root is frequently eaten fresh in salads,\r\nand with other food: and the roots when dug up young, namely, at the end of\r\nthree or four months after they have been planted, are preserved in syrup,\r\nand exported as a sweet-meat to nearly all parts of the world. The ginger\r\nwhich is brought into this country from the East Indies is much stronger\r\nthan any we have from Jamaica.\r\n\r\n  15. _CARDAMOMS are the seeds of an East Indian plant[1]_ (_Fig. 4_),\r\n  _which has shining reed-like stalks and spear-shaped glossy leaves. They\r\n  are brought into Europe in their pods, which are small, oblong,\r\n  triangular, and each divided into three cells._\r\n\r\n  _The roots are thick, fleshy, and knotted. The stalks grow from seven to\r\n  twelve feet high; and the flowers are of irregular shape, and, in colour,\r\n  are green, pink, and white._\r\n\r\nIn those woody parts of India where cardamom plants spontaneously grow, the\r\ninhabitants form plantations of them by a very simple process. They clear,\r\nfrom particular spots, the greater number of the trees; and, towards the\r\nclose of the fourth rainy season afterwards, they look for the first crop\r\nof cardamoms (raised from the scattered seeds which have lain dormant in\r\nthe ground), and they are seldom disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe cardamom harvest usually commences in October, and lasts till December.\r\nWomen or children pluck the fruit-stalks from the roots, carry them into\r\nthe houses, and there spread them upon mats to dry. The pods are then\r\nseparated from the stalks by stripping them with the fingers: they undergo\r\nsome further processes of drying; after which they are packed for\r\nexportation, in large chests, which are well pitched at the joints and\r\nseams, to prevent them from being injured by moisture. It is estimated that\r\nabout 15,000 pounds weight of these seeds are annually vended at the East\r\nIndia Company's sales.\r\n\r\nCardamoms have a pleasant aromatic smell; and, when chewed, impart to the\r\nmouth a warmth and pungency, which, to most persons, are extremely\r\ngrateful. The Indians use them, in considerable quantity, in their food;\r\nand also mix them with betel (22), and chew them, under a belief that they\r\ntend to facilitate digestion. They are sometimes used with us in medicine,\r\nbut more frequently for the purpose of concealing the nauseous taste of\r\nother medicines.\r\n\r\n  16. _TURMERIC is a thick, fleshy, and solid East Indian root, which is\r\n  usually seen in pieces from half an inch to two inches and upwards in\r\n  length; has a yellowish and rugged surface, and is of a shining saffron\r\n  brown colour within._\r\n\r\n  _The flowers of the turmeric plant_ (Curcuma longa) _are white, and form\r\n  an ear or spike, which issues immediately from the root. The leaves are\r\n  spear-shaped, and each eight or nine inches long._\r\n\r\nThis root, which has an aromatic smell somewhat resembling that of ginger,\r\nis much cultivated in the East Indies, where it is in common use as a\r\nseasoning for ragouts and other dishes. It constitutes a principal\r\ningredient in _curry powder_; and, under this form, is used, in great\r\nquantities, both in India and Europe. Some years ago it had considerable\r\nrepute as a medicine for the removal of jaundice, diseases of the liver,\r\nand other complaints: but the chief purpose for which it is now esteemed is\r\nits imparting a rich yellow dye to silks, linen, or woollen; and for\r\nheightening and rendering brighter the red colours dyed with cochineal and\r\nvermilion. It is in much request by glovers, for dyeing yellow gloves. Some\r\nof the Indian tribes use it in painting their bodies.\r\n\r\n  17. _ARROW ROOT, in the state that we see it, is a kind of starch,\r\n  manufactured from the root of a plant which is cultivated both in the\r\n  East and West Indies._\r\n\r\n  _This plant_ (Maranta arundinacea) _is about two feet high, has broad,\r\n  pointed, and somewhat hairy leaves; small white flowers in clusters, and\r\n  a nearly globular fruit about the size of a currant._\r\n\r\nThe arrow-root plant has its name from the Indians using its juice as a\r\nremedy for wounds inflicted by poisoned arrows. They likewise consider it\r\nefficacious against the stings of those venomous insects with which the\r\ncountries of nearly all hot climates abound.\r\n\r\nThe starch or powder of arrow-root is obtained by the following process.\r\nThe roots, when a year old, are dug up, washed, and beaten to a milky pulp,\r\nin deep wooden mortars. This pulp is afterwards well washed in clean water,\r\nand the fibrous parts, that are found amongst it, are carefully separated\r\nand thrown away. It is next passed through a sieve, or coarse cloth, and\r\nsuffered to stand for some time to settle. The water that remains is\r\nsubsequently drawn off, and the white mass at the bottom is again washed.\r\nAfter this the water is entirely cleared away, and the pulp, when dried in\r\nthe sun, is an extremely pure kind of starch; which requires only to be\r\nreduced to powder to attain the state in which we import it.\r\n\r\nThere is no European vegetable, if we except the _salep_ or _orchis root_\r\n(219), which yields so large a proportion of nutritive mucilage as this.\r\nConsequently, as an article of diet for children, and persons recovering\r\nfrom illness, it has of late years been found extremely valuable. Care,\r\nhowever, should be taken to obtain it genuine, as the high price for which\r\nit is sold is frequently the cause of its being adulterated. It is even\r\nsaid that the article usually sold in London under the name of arrow-root,\r\nconsists chiefly of starch made from potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--DIANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  18. _The OLIVE_ (Olea Europea) _is a low evergreen tree, which, in its\r\n  general form and appearance, somewhat resembles a willow. It is\r\n  cultivated in several parts of the continent, and has spear-shaped\r\n  leaves, and clusters of small white flowers, that arise at the junction\r\n  of the leaves and branches_ (_Fig. 1._)\r\n\r\nThe fruit of this tree has the name of _olives_. These are usually about\r\nthe size of a damson plum, and each contains a hard, rough stone. When\r\nfirst gathered they have an acrid, bitter, and unpleasant taste; and it is\r\nnot until they have been steeped, for several days, in a ley of wood ashes,\r\nand then pickled in salt and water, that they are in the state to be\r\nintroduced at table after dinner, in desserts. Lucca olives, being smaller\r\nthan any others, have the weakest taste. The larger ones are imported from\r\nSpain, and are the strongest; but those most esteemed are the olives of\r\nProvence, which are of middle size. If olives be eaten by persons of\r\ndelicate habits, especially after a solid or heavy dinner, they are\r\nconsidered injurious, on account of the great quantity of oil they contain.\r\n\r\nIt is to this fruit that we are indebted for the _salad_ or _olive oil_,\r\nwhich is so much in use throughout every part of Europe. The preparation of\r\nit is as follows:--The olives, when sufficiently ripe, are carefully\r\npicked, by hand, off the trees, and those that are bad are taken out and\r\nthrown aside. After having been left a little while to wither, they are\r\nfirst bruised, and then more completely crushed, by an upright millstone\r\nrolling upon an horizontal plane. The paste thus formed is submitted to the\r\noperation of the press. The finest oil flows first: when no more is found\r\nto flow, the pulp is moistened with boiling water, and the mass is again\r\npressed. This done, the remaining oil is drawn from the surface of the\r\nwater, but it contains some impurities from which it cannot, without\r\ndifficulty, be cleared. What remains of the pulp is squeezed into lumps or\r\nballs, and dried for fuel. If the olives be indiscriminately gathered and\r\nheaped together, sound and unsound, without selection, the oil is always\r\nbad. The wild trees yield a very small kind of fruit, which furnishes,\r\nthough in less quantity, a peculiarly excellent oil.\r\n\r\nThe olive tree has ever been considered the symbol of peace; and the\r\nancient poets have asserted that Minerva well merited the honour of giving\r\nher name to the city of Athens for having planted it in Attica. As a\r\n_wood_, this tree is in considerable request by cabinet makers, from its\r\nbeing beautifully veined, and taking an excellent polish. In some parts of\r\nSpain, ornamental boxes are made of the roots of the olive tree.\r\n\r\nOlive oil is employed in various branches of culinary and domestic economy.\r\nWhen united with soda, it is manufactured into soap. It is likewise used in\r\nmedicine; is adopted as a softening ingredient in almost all kinds of\r\nointments and plasters, and is supposed to be efficacious as a remedy\r\nagainst the poison of the viper. Persons copiously anointed with oil are\r\nsaid to have escaped the infection of the plague and yellow fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  19. _THE COMMON JASMINE_ (Jasminum officinale) _is a well known shrub,\r\n  with white, salver-shaped flowers, and opposite, winged leaves, the\r\n  leaflets somewhat pointed; and is a native of Malabar and other parts of\r\n  the East._\r\n\r\nAs an ornamental shrub, jasmine has long been cultivated in Europe. It is\r\nchiefly trained against walls and trellis-work, and is interesting, not\r\nonly from the elegance of its foliage, but also from the number of\r\nbeautiful white flowers with which it is adorned throughout the summer and\r\nautumn. These exhale a sweet and penetrating odour, particularly after\r\nrain, and in the night.\r\n\r\nThe Italians, by a very simple operation, prepare from the flowers of\r\njasmine a grateful perfume. They soak cotton-wool in some kind of scentless\r\nvegetable oil, and then place, in glass vessels, alternate layers of this\r\nand of the flowers. After having been left in this state some days, the\r\nflowers are found to have given the whole of their fragrance to the oil in\r\nthe cotton: they are then separated, and the oil is pressed out and removed\r\ninto small glass bottles for use.\r\n\r\n  20. _BLACK PEPPER is the dried berry of a climbing or trailing plant_\r\n  (Piper nigrum, Fig. 3) _which grows in the East Indies, and in most of\r\n  the islands of the Indian Sea._\r\n\r\n  _Its stem has numerous joints, and throws out roots at every joint. The\r\n  leaves, which are somewhat egg-shaped, and pointed, are of a brownish\r\n  colour, and have each seven very strong nerves. The flowers are small and\r\n  white._\r\n\r\nIn the cultivation of pepper it is customary to mark out the grounds into\r\nregular squares of about six feet each, which is the usual distance allowed\r\nfor the plants. And, as these have not sufficient strength to support\r\nthemselves in an upright growth, they are generally placed near a thorny\r\nkind of shrub, among the branches of which they creep like ivy. When they\r\nhave run to a considerable height, the twigs, on which the berries hang,\r\nbend down, and the fruit appears in long slender clusters, of from twenty\r\nto fifty grains, somewhat resembling, but much more compact than, bunches\r\nof currants. The berries are green when young, but change to a bright red\r\ncolour when ripe. As soon as they begin to redden, they are in a fit state\r\nto be gathered. When gathered, they are spread upon mats in the sun, where\r\nthey are suffered to remain till they become dry, black, and shrivelled, as\r\nwe see them. In this state they have the denomination of _black pepper_.\r\n\r\n_White pepper_ is nothing more than the best and soundest of the berries,\r\ngathered when they are fully ripe, and stripped of their external coat or\r\nskin. To effect this they are steeped, for about a week, in salt water, by\r\nthe end of which time the skins burst. They are then dried in the sun,\r\nrubbed between the hands, and winnowed. Thus cleared from their skins they\r\nare rendered smaller and more smooth than black pepper.\r\n\r\nAs the acridity of pepper lies principally in the skin, this kind becomes,\r\nof course, much less pungent than the other; but it has one recommendation,\r\nthat it can be made only of the best and soundest grains, taken at their\r\nmost perfect state of maturity.\r\n\r\nPepper is an article of considerable traffic betwixt this country and the\r\nEast Indies. That which is imported from Malabar is considered better than\r\nany other. The quantity of pepper vended at the East India Company's sales\r\nhas, in some years, exceeded six millions of pounds' weight, of which seven\r\nor eight hundred thousand pounds have been retained for home consumption.\r\n\r\nBoth black and white pepper are in daily use, not only as a spice, but also\r\nin cookery. When coarsely ground, pepper is eaten with peas, cabbages,\r\ncucumbers, and other flatulent and cold vegetables; and occasionally also\r\nwith fish. It is sometimes employed in medicine as a stimulant.\r\n\r\nA singular imposition respecting pepper is occasionally practised in retail\r\nshops in London: artificial pepper-corns, both black and white, are mixed\r\nand sold with real pepper. The detection of this fraudulent mixture,\r\nhowever, is easy. If a handful of the suspected pepper be thrown into\r\nwater, the artificial corns will fall to powder, or be partially dissolved,\r\nwhile the true pepper-corns will remain whole. The fraudulent grains are\r\nsaid to be made of peas-meal.\r\n\r\n  21. _LONG PEPPER is the fruit of a slender climbing shrub_ (Piper longum)\r\n  _which grows in the East Indies._\r\n\r\n  _It is of cylindrical shape, about an inch and half in length, and a\r\n  quarter of an inch in thickness; and is formed by the union of a great\r\n  number of small rounded grains. The shrub that produces it has dark green\r\n  and heart-shaped leaves, each with seven strong nerves._\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of long pepper is annually imported in this country\r\nfrom Bengal and other parts of the East, for use, both in domestic economy\r\nand in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of India drink water in which long pepper has been infused,\r\nand esteem it a valuable remedy for some disorders of the stomach. They\r\nalso distil an ardent spirit from it; and they pickle this fruit in\r\nvinegar, for use at table.\r\n\r\nThe fruit that is collected for exportation is gathered before it is quite\r\nripe.\r\n\r\n  22. _BETEL is the leaf of a climbing East Indian plant_ (Piper betel)\r\n  _which belongs to the same tribe as pepper; and, in shape and appearance,\r\n  is not much unlike that of ivy, but is more tender, and full of juice._\r\n\r\nThere is an almost incredible consumption of betel over the whole continent\r\nof India. The inhabitants chew it almost incessantly, and in such quantity\r\nthat their lips become quite red, and their teeth black, a colour greatly\r\npreferred by them to the whiteness which Europeans so much affect. They\r\ncarry it, in little white boxes, about their persons, and present it to\r\neach other, by way of compliment and civility, in the same manner as the\r\nEuropeans do snuff. This is done by women as well as by men: and it would\r\nbe considered an offence if those to whom it was offered should refuse to\r\naccept of, and chew it. The leaves are sometimes used alone, but much more\r\ncommonly covered with a kind of lime made of sea shells, and wrapped round\r\nslices of the areca nut (245).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--TRIANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  23. _SAFFRON is the orange-coloured pistil, or centre part, of a purple\r\n  species of crocus_ (Crocus sativus) _which flowers in the autumn, and is\r\n  chiefly distinguished by having the three extremities of the pistil so\r\n  long as to hang out of the flower_ (Fig. 6.)\r\n\r\nIn Cambridgeshire there is a town called Saffron Walden, that has its name\r\nfrom the quantity of saffron which is annually produced in its\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe roots of the saffron crocuses are planted at the distance of about five\r\ninches from each other, and two inches deep in the ground. As soon as the\r\nflowers appear, they are gathered by hand every morning, just before they\r\nopen; and, as they continue to open in succession for several weeks, the\r\nsaffron harvest of course continues so long. When the flowers are gathered,\r\nthey are spread on a table: the upper part of the pistil only is picked\r\nout, and the rest of the flower is thrown away. As soon as a sufficient\r\nquantity of the pistils have been collected, they are dried in a kind of\r\nportable kiln; over this a hair cloth is stretched, and upon it a few\r\nsheets of white paper. The saffron is scattered upon these to the thickness\r\nof two or three inches, and is then covered with several sheets of paper,\r\nover which is laid a coarse blanket five or six times doubled, or a canvas\r\nbag filled with straw. As soon as the fire has heated the kiln, a board, on\r\nwhich a weight is put, is placed upon the blanket to press the saffron into\r\na cake. By the end of the first hour, a strong fire being employed, the\r\ncake is formed. This is then turned, and, for another hour, is subjected to\r\nan equal degree of heat. It is then turned a second time, and a more gentle\r\nheat is employed, till the cake becomes dry, during which time it is turned\r\nevery half hour.\r\n\r\nA field of saffron will continue in perfection for three or four years,\r\nyielding progressively, during this period, more numerous and larger\r\nflowers, as well as an increase of the bulbous roots; after which the\r\noffsets may be advantageously transplanted to other situations.\r\n\r\nThe saffron which is grown in England is considered superior to any that is\r\nimported from other countries. The best saffron may be known by the breadth\r\nof the blades. It ought not to be of too deep a red or orange colour, and\r\nshould be fresh and tough, and have a strong but pleasant aromatic odour.\r\nSaffron should not be kept more than twelve months.\r\n\r\nSaffron was much used by the ancients as a perfume, but, in this respect,\r\ntheir taste was very different from ours. Not only were the halls,\r\ntheatres, and courts, through which they wished to diffuse an agreeable\r\nsmell, strewed with this substance, but it was used by them for a scent, in\r\nvinous extracts. From saffron, with the addition of wax, the Greeks, as\r\nwell as the Romans, prepared scented salves. In our own country it was\r\nformerly much used in medicine; having been esteemed an excellent remedy in\r\nhysterical and other complaints. When taken in small doses, it tends to\r\nexhilarate the spirits; but it ought to be used with great moderation. It\r\nis sometimes used by bakers, to colour and flavour different kinds of cakes\r\nand biscuits. With water or spirits it gives out a beautiful yellow colour;\r\nbut this is not useful as a dye, as, on exposure to the air, it soon fades;\r\nand no means have hitherto been discovered by which it can be fixed and\r\nrendered permanent.\r\n\r\n  24. _ORRIS ROOT is the root of a white flowered kind of iris, called_\r\n  Florentine Iris (Iris Florentina), _which is a native of Italy, and is\r\n  distinguished by having two flowers on each stalk, the petals bearded,\r\n  and the leaves sword-shaped._\r\n\r\nIn a dried state this root is well known on account of its grateful odour,\r\nwhich somewhat approaches that of the violet. It is consequently much used\r\nin the manufacture of hair-powder, and other articles for which an\r\nagreeable scent is required. It is sometimes employed in medicine as a\r\npectoral or expectorant, and sometimes in dropsies. In a recent state the\r\nroot is extremely acrid; and, when chewed, it excites in the mouth a\r\npungent taste, which continues for several hours; but this acrimony is\r\nalmost wholly dissipated by drying.\r\n\r\nOrris-root is chiefly imported from Leghorn.\r\n\r\n  25. _The YELLOW WATER-FLAG, or COMMON IRIS_ (Iris pseudacorus) _is a very\r\n  conspicuous plant in most of our marshes. It has sword-shaped leaves,\r\n  and, about the middle of July, bears large and beautiful yellow flowers._\r\n\r\nThe roots of this plant possess qualities which render them capable of\r\nbeing applied to many useful purposes. Their astringency is such that it is\r\nsupposed they might be employed with great advantage in the tanning of\r\nleather. In the island of Jura, one of the Hebrides, they are used for\r\ndyeing a black colour; and the inhabitants of some parts of Scotland adopt\r\nthem instead of galls in the making of ink. For this purpose they are cut\r\ninto thin slices, and boiled, or infused in water, till the liquid is\r\ndeeply tinged with blue. This is poured clear off, and the blade of a\r\nknife, or some other piece of iron, is put into it, and rubbed hard with a\r\nrough white pebble, by which process, after a little while, the liquor\r\nbecomes perfectly black.\r\n\r\nA slice of the fresh root, if held between the teeth, will, it is said,\r\nalmost instantly remove the sensibility, and thus alleviate the pain, of\r\ntooth-ache. The leaves of this plant are considered poisonous to all cattle\r\nexcept sheep.\r\n\r\n  26. _The PAPYRUS is a sedge-like plant_ (Cyperus papyrus), _which grows\r\n  in watery places in Egypt, Syria, Sicily, and Madagascar._\r\n\r\n  _It has a three-sided stem, many feet in height, which is terminated by a\r\n  bushy head, consisting of a large and compound clustre of flowers._\r\n\r\nFrom this plant the ancients made their paper; and the process of\r\nmanufacturing it is described by Pliny, the Roman naturalist, to have been\r\nvery simple. The inner rind of the stem was merely cut into strips, and\r\nlaid in parallel and transverse rows; and these, on being heavily pressed\r\nwith weights, adhered together. The substance thus formed, though of rude\r\ntexture, was capable of being written upon; and there are many manuscripts\r\nstill extant on paper of this description. The ancients also sometimes\r\nemployed the sword-shaped leaves of this plant for writing upon. With the\r\nformer a kind of ink was used; but on the latter the letters were formed by\r\na metallic, pointed instrument, called by the Romans a stylus.\r\n\r\nBut the papyrus plant was not merely useful for writing upon. The\r\ninhabitants of the countries where it is found manufacture it, even to this\r\nday, into sail-cloth, mattresses, ropes, and sometimes even into wearing\r\napparel. When the stems are compactly woven together, and plastered,\r\nexternally, with a kind of resinous substance, so as to prevent the\r\nadmission of water, they are made into boats. These, though they resemble\r\ngreat baskets in appearance, are of considerable use to the inhabitants.\r\nThe \"ark of bulrushes daubed with slime and pitch,\" in which the infant\r\nMoses was placed, is supposed, by the best commentators, to have been a\r\nboat made of this plant.\r\n\r\nThe floral _thyrsus_ which was used to adorn the temples and statues of the\r\ngods, was a representation of the tuft of the papyrus.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  27. _SUGAR is the concrete or crystallized juice of the_ sugar cane\r\n  (Saccharum officinarum, Fig. 5), _a plant, much cultivated both in the\r\n  East and West Indies, which has a jointed stem eight or nine feet high,\r\n  long and flat leaves of greenish yellow colour, and flowers in bunches._\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the sugar-cane is pursued to great extent in the islands\r\nof the West Indies, where, about three centuries ago, it was first\r\nintroduced from China, or some other parts of the East, and where it\r\nflourishes with great luxuriance, particularly in moist and rich ground.\r\n\r\nThe season for planting it commences about the beginning of August. This\r\noperation is performed by laying the canes in rows, in trenches formed for\r\nthe purpose. Roots issue from each joint; and, in the course of nine or ten\r\nmonths, the stems which rise from these respective roots, and constitute\r\nthe sugar crop, attain their perfect state. The saccharine juice is\r\ncontained in a spongy pith with which the interior of the plant is filled.\r\n\r\nWhen cut down, the leaves are thrown aside as of no use in the manufacture\r\nof sugar, and the stems or canes are divided into pieces, each about a yard\r\nin length. These are tied together in bundles, and conveyed to the\r\nsugar-mill; where they are bruised betwixt three upright wooden rollers\r\ncovered with iron. The juice, which flows from them, is conducted, by\r\ncanals, into a large vessel formed for receiving it. The quantity of juice\r\nprepared by some of these mills is upwards of ten thousand gallons in a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe next operation is called clarifying. For this purpose the juice is\r\nconducted, along a wooden gutter lined with lead, to a place called the\r\nboiling house, where it is received into copper pans, or caldrons, each\r\nplaced over a separate fire. A certain proportion of powdered lime is now\r\nadded to it, for the purpose of taking up any acid which the juice may\r\nhappen to contain. The heat is then increased until the liquor is nearly in\r\na boiling state. By this process the greatest part of the impurities that\r\nwere contained in the juice rise to the surface in a scum. The purified\r\nliquor is then carefully drawn off, either by a syphon or a cock, leaving\r\nthe scum at the bottom of the pan.\r\n\r\nFrom these pans it is conveyed, by another gutter, or channel, to the grand\r\ncopper, or evaporating boiler, where the scum, which rises to the surface,\r\nis skimmed off as the liquor boils. After undergoing a similar process in\r\nsmaller boilers, with a farther mixture of lime, until it has attained a\r\ncertain degree of thickness, it is transferred into a large shallow wooden\r\nvessel, where, as it cools, it granulates or runs into an imperfect\r\ncrystallization, by which it is in some degree separated from the\r\n_molasses_ or _treacle_, an impure part of the juice, which is incapable of\r\nbeing crystallized, and which, in large casks, is exported, for various\r\nuseful purposes, to the different countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the cooler the sugar is removed to the curing-house. This is a large,\r\nairy building, furnished with a capacious cistern, for the reception of the\r\nmolasses. Over the cistern is an open frame of strong joist-work; upon\r\nwhich are placed several empty hogsheads, each open at the head, and having\r\na few holes at the bottom, closed by stalks of the plantain tree thrust\r\nthrough them. The mass of saccharine matter is now put into these\r\nhogsheads; the molasses are separated from the sugar, by draining, into the\r\ncistern, through the spongy stalks of the plantain; and the remainder, thus\r\nentirely crystallized, has the name of _muscovado_ or _raw sugar_.\r\n\r\nThe article denominated _clayed sugar_ undergoes a process somewhat\r\ndifferent. For the preparation of this, the sugar, when taken from the\r\ncoolers, is put into conical vessels of earthen-ware, each having, at its\r\nbottom, a hole, about half an inch in diameter, which, at the commencement\r\nof the process, is stopped with a plug. This plug, after the sugar has\r\nbecome perfectly cool, is removed, and the molasses drain through the hole.\r\nWhen these have ceased to run, the surface of the sugar, in the vessel, is\r\ncovered with fine clay, to a certain thickness, and water is poured upon\r\nthe clay. This, oozing through it, pervades the whole mass of sugar,\r\nre-dissolves the molasses still remaining in it, with some parts of the\r\nsugar itself, carries these off through the hole at the bottom, and renders\r\nthe sugar, that is left, much purer than that which is made the other way.\r\n\r\nThe further refining of sugar, or forming it into the white conical loaves\r\nwhich are so much used in this country, is the business of the European\r\nsugar-bakers. This is done by dissolving the raw sugar in water, boiling\r\nthe solution in lime water; and then clarifying it with bullock's blood, or\r\nthe white of eggs, and straining it through woollen bags. After due\r\nevaporation it is suffered to cool to a certain degree. It is then poured\r\ninto conical moulds of unglazed earthen-ware, the summits of which are\r\nperforated. Here it concretes into a hard white mass, leaving that part of\r\nthe syrup, which will not crystallize, to run off through the hole in the\r\npoint of the cone. The broad end of the cone is then covered with moist\r\nclay, the water from which penetrates into the sugar, and displaces and\r\ncarries off the impurities which, otherwise, would be retained in and\r\ndiscolour it. It is then carefully dried, and receives the name of _loaf_,\r\nor _lump sugar_.\r\n\r\n_Sugar-candy_ is formed by boiling down a solution of sugar till it becomes\r\nthick; and then removing it into a very hot room, to crystallize upon\r\nsticks or strings, placed across small tubs, or other vessels. It is\r\ndenominated brown or white sugar-candy, according to the quality of the\r\nsugar of which it is made.\r\n\r\n_Barley sugar_ is sugar boiled in barley water, but now more frequently in\r\ncommon water, till it is brittle. It is then rolled on a stone anointed\r\nwith oil of sweet almonds, and formed into twisted sticks. To give it a\r\ncolour, a small quantity of saffron is sometimes mixed with it.\r\n\r\nWhen sugar was first introduced into this country, it was employed only as\r\na medicine; but it has now become an essential article both of luxury and\r\nuse. It is the basis of syrups; and is used in cooking, and in confections,\r\npreserves, sweetmeats, and liqueurs of every description. Sugar is also\r\nsometimes employed in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the sugar-cane is so palatable, and at the same time so\r\nnutritive, that, during the sugar harvest, every creature which partakes\r\nfreely of it, whether man or animal, appears to derive health and vigour\r\nfrom its use. The meagre and sickly negroes exhibit, at this season, a\r\nsurprising alteration; they now become fat and healthy. The labouring\r\nhorses, oxen, and mules, being allowed, almost without restraint, to eat of\r\nthe refuse plants, and of the scummings from the boiling-house, improve now\r\ninfinitely more than they do at any other season of the year.\r\n\r\n_Rum_ is a spirituous liquor distilled from molasses, scummings of the hot\r\ncane juice from the boiling house, or raw cane liquor from canes expressed\r\nfor that purpose, lees (or, as it is called in Jamaica, _dunder_), and\r\nwater. The dunder answers the purpose of yeast for the fermentation.\r\n\r\nSugar-canes, as large and juicy as those of the West Indies, are cultivated\r\nin several parts of Spain, but particularly in the country betwixt Malaga\r\nand Gibraltar. They were originally introduced, by the Moors, several\r\ncenturies ago; and the sugar made from them is of excellent quality. There\r\nare sugar mills, in more than twelve different places, on the coast of\r\nGrenada, all of which are fully employed: in one village there are four,\r\nwhich cost at least 5,000_l._ sterling each.\r\n\r\n  28. _OATS are the seeds or grain of an annual plant_ (Avena sativa, Fig.\r\n  14), _too well known, and too much cultivated throughout every part of\r\n  Europe, to need any description._\r\n\r\n  _The country from which they were originally imported is not known._\r\n\r\nThe principal use of oats in this country is for the feeding of horses. In\r\nthe northern parts of England, and in Scotland, they are applied also to\r\nthe nutriment of man. When simply freed from their husks they are called\r\n_groats_ or _grits_; and, in this state, are much used in broths, and other\r\nkinds of nutriment for sick and infirm persons. More frequently, however,\r\nthey are ground into _oatmeal_, which is made into cakes, biscuits, &c. The\r\nhusks, infused in water, and allowed to remain till the water becomes\r\nsomewhat acid, are boiled to a jelly called _sowins_. A grateful and\r\nnutritive kind of jelly, which has the name of _flummery_, is also made of\r\noatmeal, boiled with water, and flavoured with a little orange-flower\r\nwater, and sugar.\r\n\r\nOats will thrive in almost any soil, but they are chiefly productive on\r\nland that has been newly broken up. They are usually sown in February or\r\nMarch, and the harvest commences about August. Several kinds or varieties\r\nare cultivated in different parts of England, such as _white oats_, _black\r\noats_, _brown_ or _red oats_, _Tartarian_ or _reed oats_, _Friezeland\r\noats_, _Poland oats_, and some others, but, of these, the first are\r\nconsidered the most valuable.\r\n\r\n  29. _WHEAT is a well known kind of corn_ (Triticum hybernum, Fig. 13)\r\n  _which is cultivated in most of the civilized countries of the world, and\r\n  is supposed to have been originally introduced into Europe, from some\r\n  part of Asia._\r\n\r\nNo grain is so valuable to the inhabitants of nearly all climates as this;\r\nand, by a wonderful ordination of Providence, it is rendered capable of\r\nsustaining, without injury, almost the two extremes of heat and cold. Not\r\nonly does it ripen in Egypt and Barbary, but it ripens equally well in\r\nScotland, Denmark, and Sweden.\r\n\r\nIt constitutes the chief food of the British nation; and its abundance or\r\nscarcity regulates, in a great degree, the welfare and prosperity of the\r\ninhabitants. The whole annual consumption of grain, in this island, amounts\r\nto nearly 25,000,000 quarters; and in London alone, to more than 1,162,100\r\nquarters. Of this by far the greatest proportion is wheat.\r\n\r\nFor the cultivation of this important grain the best lands are rich clays\r\nand heavy loam; and, although light soils will produce wheat of excellent\r\nquality, yet the crops on the other soils are by far the most abundant. The\r\nbest season for committing the seed to the ground is September, and the\r\nearlier in the month the better. Some farmers consider it necessary to\r\nsteep the seed in brine or other pickle before it is used, to prevent it\r\nfrom being devoured by vermin, and render the corn less liable to disease\r\nthan it would be without this process. In a good season the wheat harvest\r\ncommences in August, and is finished in the course of the ensuing month.\r\nThis species of corn is usually cut with instruments called reaping-hooks,\r\nbut in some parts it is mown with scythes.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds or varieties of wheat that are cultivated in this\r\ncountry are too numerous to be particularized.\r\n\r\nWheat is liable to injury, not only from the attack of insects, but from\r\nseveral kinds of disease, the principal of which are _blight_, _mildew_,\r\nand _smut_. In the former the fibres and leaves of the plants are\r\ncontracted and enfeebled, and the grain is ultimately deprived of\r\nsufficient nourishment: by mildew the straw and ear are affected: and by\r\nsmut the grains, instead of containing their proper substance, become\r\nfilled with a black or dark brown powder.\r\n\r\n_Wheat flour_ consists of four distinct principles, gluten, starch,\r\nalbumen, and a sweet kind of mucilage. And it is a remarkable circumstance,\r\nthat the _gluten_, if not similar, has a very near alliance to animal\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate the various ways in which preparations from wheat serve for\r\nnutriment would be unnecessary, as they are known to every one.\r\n\r\n_Starch_ is a substance frequently prepared from wheat, and is obtained by\r\nthe following process. The wheat is put into tubs of water, and exposed,\r\nfor some days, to the heat of the sun, in order to bring on a proper degree\r\nof fermentation, the water being changed twice a day. Having now become\r\nsufficiently soft, it is poured into large canvass bags, which are worked\r\nor beaten, on a board over an empty vessel, to extract the farinaceous\r\nparticles. Fresh water is put to it, and after being considerably agitated,\r\nit is allowed to subside. As the sediment increases, the water is gradually\r\ndrained off, and, at length, the starch is formed into small pieces, and\r\ndried for use.\r\n\r\nDuring the late war, when the intercourse betwixt France and the West\r\nIndian islands was entirely cut off, several attempts were made in that\r\ncountry to obtain _sugar_ from starch. The process was a long and intricate\r\none; and the success with which it was attended was not such as to render\r\nit either practically or permanently useful.\r\n\r\n_Bran_ is the husk of wheat, separated in grinding. Infusions of bran are,\r\nnot unfrequently, employed both externally and internally in medicine. They\r\nare also sometimes used to cleanse the hands instead of soap. And, in times\r\nof scarcity, bran has been advantageously employed in the making of\r\nhousehold bread.\r\n\r\n_Wheat straw_, when chopped or cut small, forms a wholesome provender for\r\nhorses and oxen, especially when mixed with green food. It is also used as\r\nlitter for horses, and is employed as thatch for cottages, houses, and\r\nbarns. When cut into certain lengths, bleached by means of sulphur, and\r\nsplit, it is plaited, and formed into hats and bonnets.\r\n\r\nA nutritive substance called _Semolina_ is formed from wheat flour,\r\ngranulated by a particular process. A patent was granted in the year 1780\r\nto Mr. Jacob Levy, for a method of making it. Previously to this, semolina\r\nhad been imported from Poland, under the name of _Cracow groats_. It\r\nconstitutes a light and wholesome food for invalids, being considered, in\r\nthis respect, preferable to sago; it may also be made into excellent\r\npuddings.\r\n\r\n_Macaroni_ is a preparation from the finest wheat flour, mixed with eggs,\r\nor other glutinous substance. It is chiefly imported from Italy, Sicily,\r\nand Germany. Its name implies _cut paste_, and it is eaten in various ways;\r\non the continent with milk, and with us in soups and puddings, or served up\r\nin a dish with grated cheese, milk, and other ingredients.\r\n\r\n_Vermicelli_ is made by a mixture of flour, cheese, the yolks of eggs,\r\nsugar and saffron. This, being reduced to a proper consistency, is formed\r\ninto long slender pieces or threads, like worms, by being forced, with a\r\npiston, through a number of little holes, in the end of a pipe made for the\r\npurpose. Vermicelli was first brought from Italy, and it is chiefly used in\r\nsoups and other culinary preparations.\r\n\r\n  30. _BARLEY is a well known kind of corn_ (Hordeum distichon, Fig. 15.)\r\n  _which grows wild in the island of Sicily, and some other parts of the\r\n  south of Europe._\r\n\r\nNext to wheat, this is, in Europe, the most valuable of all the species of\r\ngrain, especially for growth on light and sharp soils. The seed-time for\r\nbarley usually commences about the end of March or the beginning of April,\r\nand sometimes lasts until the first week in June; and, for the produce,\r\nfour quarters per acre are considered a fair average crop, and eight\r\nquarters a very extraordinary one.\r\n\r\nFew instances of fecundity in corn are more remarkable than what has been\r\nrelated of two grains of SIX-ROWED BARLEY (_Hordeum hexastichon_) which\r\nwere planted in a garden: they produced 113 stalks, nearly all of which\r\nyielded ears; and these contained, in the whole, more than 2,500 grains.\r\n\r\nThe principal use to which barley is applied in this country is for the\r\nmaking of _malt_, from which beer and ale are brewed. For this purpose it\r\nis first steeped in water for three or four days. It is then taken out, and\r\nsuffered to lie, until it begins to sprout or germinate. As soon as the\r\ngermination has approached a certain state its further progress is\r\nprevented by drying the barley in a kiln, heated with coke, charcoal, or\r\nstraw. The grain has now become mellow and sweet; and, after having been\r\ncrushed in a kind of mill contrived for the purpose, its saccharine\r\nqualities are easily extracted by the boiling water, in brewing. The liquor\r\nthat is thus produced has the name of _wort_; and this, after having\r\nundergone the process of fermentation, and having received a bitter flavour\r\nby a mixture of hops, becomes ale or beer. Hence has originated the general\r\nappellation of _malt liquor_. What remains of the malt after brewing is\r\ncalled _grains_. These, in London, are employed for the feeding of horses,\r\ncows, and swine.\r\n\r\nBesides the use of barley in brewing, there is in some countries,\r\nespecially in Scotland and Germany, a great consumption of this grain, for\r\nbroths, soups, and other food. For this purpose it is freed from its husks\r\nand formed into round granules, about the size of small shot, and of a\r\npearly whiteness, which thence have the name of _pearl-barley_. All except\r\nthe heart or best part of the grain is thus taken away. The barley, in this\r\nstate, when boiled, forms a nutritive food; and a decoction of it, properly\r\nflavoured with acid, is said to be one of the best beverages that can be\r\nadopted in acute diseases. The making of pearl barley is a German\r\ninvention. In Scotland the lower classes make it by means of hand-mills;\r\nand many persons are satisfied with merely ridding the grain of its husks\r\nby stamping it in mortars.\r\n\r\n_Barley-meal_ is occasionally made into bread by the poor; and it is\r\nlikewise used for the fattening of poultry and swine. From _barley-straw_ a\r\nyellowish coloured paper has been manufactured; the making of which was,\r\nsome years ago, attempted in this country upon a large scale, but without\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n  31. _RYE_ (Secale cereale, Fig. 16.) _is a kind of grain supposed to have\r\n  been first introduced into the northern parts of Europe from the island\r\n  of Crete._\r\n\r\nAs bread corn, sometimes alone, but more commonly mixed with wheat, rye was\r\nformerly in great request, particularly in the northern counties of\r\nEngland. This mixture, which is denominated _blend-corn_, or _maslin_, is\r\nat present partially used, in certain districts, not only from motives of\r\neconomy, but also because the rye is supposed to render the bread more\r\nmoist and palatable than it would otherwise be. In some part of the\r\ncountry, rye is much used by ginger-bread bakers, for the dark colour of\r\nits flour is not perceptible, when mixed with treacle. This species of\r\ngrain is frequently used for the distillation of spirits.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked, in some districts of France, that rye, from bad\r\nseasons, or from other causes, has proved noxious and even poisonous. The\r\ngrains of the corn, thus degenerated, are black on the outside and\r\ntolerably white within; and, when dry, are harder and closer than good\r\ngrain. Bread that is made of rye which contains even a great quantity of\r\nthis bad corn, is not distinguishable by the taste, from other rye bread;\r\nand it seldom produces its ill effects till some time after it has been\r\neaten, it is then said to occasion gangrenes in the legs and other parts of\r\nthe body, and dangerous fevers. The poorer people, however, are those\r\nchiefly who are subject to these diseases, as many of them have little\r\nother substantial food to subsist upon than bread made of this species of\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of England rye is sown either by itself, or mixed with\r\ntares to be cut whilst green, for the feeding of sheep, cows, and horses.\r\nRye straw is used by brick-makers, and collar-manufacturers; and is\r\nconsidered an excellent material for the thatching of cottages and barns.\r\n\r\n  32. GRASSES.--_By grasses we are to understand such plants as have a\r\n  round, jointed, and hollow stem, surrounded at each joint with a single\r\n  leaf, long, narrow, and pointed; and the flowers of which are a kind of\r\n  chaffy husk. According to this definition, wheat, barley, oats, and rye,\r\n  properly belong to the grasses, although they are known by the peculiar\r\n  appellation of corn or grain._[2]\r\n\r\nTo the grasses it is that the face of nature is indebted for a great\r\nportion of its cheerful appearance, and its beauty. They constitute the\r\ngeneral herbage of every country, covering to an immense extent the whole\r\nsurface of the ground. They are very various in their kinds, the British\r\nspecies alone being nearly a hundred and twenty in number. To many species\r\nof animals their leaves afford an indispensable article of sustenance; and\r\ntheir seed supply food to birds.\r\n\r\n33. _SWEET-SCENTED VERNAL GRASS_ (_Anthoxanthum odoratum_, Fig.\r\n17).[3]--This species is usually considered (though it perhaps ought not\r\nexclusively to be so) as that to which the hay fields are indebted for\r\ntheir well-known and delightful fragrance. When partially dried it is very\r\nodorous; and, if chewed, in a recent state, its _stalks_ are highly\r\naromatic, tasting not unlike those of fresh lavender. The _root_ has an\r\nodour somewhat resembling that of musk. A distilled water, which serves as\r\na vehicle for some perfumes, is occasionally prepared from the leaves and\r\nflowers of the vernal grass. The dried flowers are employed in some parts\r\nof the Continent for imparting an agreeable flavour to snuff and tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe vernal grass is not very productive, and by some farmers it is\r\nconsidered not palatable for cattle. Others, however, esteem it an useful\r\naddition in their meadows; and, from its being generally found in great\r\nabundance on such pastures as sheep are fond of, and afford excellent\r\nmutton, it is at least thought to be a good grass for them.\r\n\r\n34. _COTTON GRASS_ (_Eriophorum angustifolium_, Fig. 18).--The seeds of\r\nthis grass are encompassed with long cottony or wool-like hairs; and so\r\nabundant are the plants in many tracts of marshy land, particularly in the\r\nnorthern parts of England, that the ground appears almost as if covered\r\nwith snow.\r\n\r\nPoor people sometimes stuff their pillows with the down of the cotton\r\ngrass; but there is a prevailing opinion that it is not wholesome to sleep\r\non. This down is probably too brittle to be manufactured by itself into\r\nthread, yet, in combination either with wool or cotton, it may be spun into\r\na strong and uniform yarn, from which gloves, stockings, and cloth, in\r\nsmall quantity, have been made. Its brittleness has been much corrected by\r\na simple chemical process. Wicks for candles have sometimes been made of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n35. _BULL-RUSH_ (_Scirpus lacustris_, Fig. 19).--Of the stems of this plant\r\nthe rush bottoms of chairs are made. Being of soft and pliant texture,\r\ntotally destitute of roughness, the bull-rush is also sometimes used for\r\nthe stuffing of pack saddles, making of mats, and thatching of cottages.\r\n\r\n36. _MEADOW FOX-TAIL GRASS_ (_Alopecurus pratensis_, Fig. 20) is a very\r\ncommon but valuable kind, which grows freely in moist and fertile pastures\r\nand meadows. It possesses, in a superior degree to any other grass, the\r\nthree great requisites of quantity, quality, and early growth. The best hay\r\nwhich is brought to London is said to be from meadows where this grass\r\nabounds; and, in many parts adjacent to the metropolis, it is extremely\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n37. _TIMOTHY GRASS, or MEADOW CATS-TAIL_ (_Phleum pratense_, Fig. 21), is a\r\ngrass much cultivated in several parts of North America, and particularly\r\nin wet, loamy grounds, where, though coarse and hard, it is found extremely\r\nproductive and useful. Such has been the celebrity of Timothy grass, that a\r\ngentleman (William Strickland, Esq.) was requested by the Board of\r\nAgriculture to make inquiries concerning it; and, from his remarks, it\r\nappears that this grass is the chief support of cattle wherever the meadows\r\nof it abound. He saw extraordinary crops of Timothy grass growing, as\r\nthickly as it could stand upon the ground, three or four feet high, and, in\r\nsome instances, as coarse as wheat straw. It is cut before it arrives at\r\nmaturity; and horses are said to prefer the hay that is made of it to every\r\nother kind, and to thrive peculiarly well upon it.\r\n\r\nThough a native and very common grass in our own country, it is doubtful\r\nwhether our climate be sufficiently warm to bring it to the same perfection\r\nin which it is found in America. It has, however, been cultivated in\r\nEngland with considerable success; and, when used for green food, for which\r\nit is particularly calculated, it may be cut two or three times in one\r\nseason; but, when intended for hay, it should be cut at least a week before\r\nit flowers.\r\n\r\n38. _FIORIN, or ORCHESTON LONG GRASS_ (_Agrostis stolonifera_, Fig. 22), is\r\nknown as a troublesome weed in moist meadows and pastures, and also in cold\r\nand stiff arable land, by name of _Black Squitch_ or _Bent-grass_. It grows\r\nwith such luxuriance, lying upon the ground, and taking root at the\r\ndifferent joints, that the stems are sometimes several feet in length; and,\r\nwhen cultivated as a crop, it has been known to produce, at two cuttings,\r\nbetwixt seven and eight tons per acre. This grass was first brought into\r\nnotice as a grass for hay, by a small tract of meadow ground, in which it\r\nwas cultivated several years ago, at a village called Orcheston, in\r\nWiltshire. Horses, sheep, and cattle are said to be extremely partial to\r\nit, and to prefer the hay which is made from it to any other. To be in\r\nperfection, it requires a moist climate, or a wet soil; and it will grow on\r\ncold clays, that are unfitted for other grasses.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland it is called fiorin grass, and, under this appellation, it was\r\nfirst introduced to the public notice in that country, in the year 1810, by\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Richardson, of Clonfecle, in the county of Antrim.\r\n\r\n39. _The MEADOW SOFT GRASS, or YORKSHIRE WHITE GRASS_ (_Holcus lanatus_,\r\nFig. 25), though it vegetates late in the season, produces an abundant\r\ncrop, and flourishes well in any moist situation. Both its foliage and\r\nflowers are soft and woolly. It is chiefly calculated for the feeding of\r\nsheep, and has answered extremely well, when close fed. The hay that is\r\nmade from it is said to be very injurious to horses, and it is not much\r\nrelished by cattle.\r\n\r\n40. _CANARY GRASS_ (_Phalaris Canariensis_, Fig. 23).--This grass grows\r\nwild in Worcestershire, and some other parts of England. It is, however,\r\noften cultivated for the sake of its seeds, which are extensively used as\r\nfood for small birds.\r\n\r\n41. _PURPLE MELIC GRASS_ (_Melica cærulea_, Fig. 24) is found in great\r\nluxuriance on the turf moors, near Glastonbury, in Somersetshire. The\r\npeople of that neighbourhood make of its stalks a neat kind of besoms,\r\nwhich are used as a cheap and tolerably good substitute for hair brooms.\r\nThis grass occurs in the most barren, sandy, and boggy situations; but,\r\nmore especially, about pools upon mountainous heaths.\r\n\r\n42. _REED MEADOW GRASS_ (_Poa aquatica_, Fig. 26) is one of the most useful\r\nof the British grasses, particularly if grown in wet meadows, or upon the\r\nbanks of rivers or brooks. In the fenny lands of Cambridgeshire and\r\nLincolnshire it not only affords a rich pasturage for cattle in summer, but\r\nforms also the chief part of their winter sustenance. In situations\r\nfavourable to its growth it sometimes attains the height of five or six\r\nfeet, When cut for hay, it is first dried, then bound up into sheaves, and\r\nformed into ricks, in which it undergoes a slight fermentation that much\r\nimproves it. Cows and sheep are both partial to this grass. As hay, it is a\r\nvaluable food for cattle, and particularly for milch cows.\r\n\r\n43. _SMOOTH-STALKED MEADOW GRASS_ (_Poa pratensis_, Fig. 27) is a favourite\r\ngrass for cattle; and flourishes even on the driest soils, growing wild in\r\nmeadows, on dry banks, and even on walls. In rich meadows of Somersetshire\r\nit forms a considerable part of the herbage; and, in those that have been\r\nflooded during the winter, it flourishes with such luxuriance as nearly to\r\nexclude every other grass. Notwithstanding this, it possesses the valuable\r\nproperty of resisting excessive drought, and is frequently green in high\r\ngravelly pastures, after almost every other grass has been withered. It\r\nflowers early, and makes an extremely valuable hay.\r\n\r\n44. _ANNUAL MEADOW GRASS_ (_Poa annua_, Fig. 28).--No grass is more common\r\nthan this, and none makes a finer turf. It occurs in almost every\r\nsituation, by the sides of roads, on open and extensive commons; and in\r\nmany parts of England there are whole meadows of it, without any mixture of\r\nother grasses. In those districts of Suffolk which produce the best butter,\r\nthe annual meadow grass is found in great abundance.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable circumstance respecting this grass, that it does not\r\nsuffer injury, but that, on the contrary, it is improved by persons\r\nfrequently walking over it. Mr. Stillingfleet states that, on the hill near\r\nMalvern, in Worcestershire, a walk which had been made for the convenience\r\nof the water drinkers, was, in less than a year, nearly covered with it,\r\nthough no plant of it could be found about any part of the hill. This was\r\nattributed, in a great measure, to the constant treading upon it, by\r\npersons passing to and from the well.\r\n\r\n45. _CRESTED DOG'S-TAIL GRASS_ (_Cynosurus cristatus_, Fig. 29) is\r\nextremely common in meadows and pastures, and constitutes a principal part\r\nof the turf, on high gravelly or chalky soils, in parks, lawns, and sheep\r\nwalks: and, from the close and thick turf which it makes, it affords good\r\nnourishment to cattle and deer. Parks that are famous for excellent venison\r\ncontain a great proportion of this grass. In the summer time its seeds\r\nafford sustenance to pigeons and small birds.\r\n\r\n46. _SHEEP'S FESCUE GRASS_ (_Festuca ovina_, Fig. 32) has great celebrity\r\nas food for horses and cattle, and, in particular, for sheep, which are\r\nsaid to prefer it to all other grasses, and to become fat upon it sooner\r\nthan upon any other. Though of short growth, its leaves are numerous and\r\nsucculent. The Tartars are said generally to fix their habitations, during\r\nthe summer, in places where there is the greatest plenty of this grass,\r\nfrom its yielding an abundant supply of excellent food for their cattle.\r\nAnd it has been remarked that the sepulchral monuments of the ancient\r\nTartars are chiefly observed in situations where Sheep's Fescue Grass\r\nabounds; this has been considered a test of the great value which that\r\npeople set upon it.\r\n\r\n47. _HARD FESCUE GRASS_ (_Festuca duruscula_, Fig. 30) is common in\r\npastures, meadows, and waste grounds. It springs early, affords excellent\r\nfood for all kinds of cattle; and, in good ground, yields a plentiful crop.\r\n\r\n48. _FLOTE FESCUE GRASS_ (_Festuca fluitans_, Fig. 31).--This plant, which\r\ngrows almost exclusively in wet ditches, and in ponds, is so favourite a\r\nfood of horses and swine, that they will sometimes even endanger their\r\nlives to obtain it. A farmer, who resided some years ago at Ruscomb, in\r\nBerkshire, assured Mr. Stillingfleet that he had known a field of four\r\nacres (which was nearly always covered with water) afford sufficient\r\nnutriment to maintain five farm horses, in good condition, from April to\r\nthe end of harvest, without any other food; and that it yielded even more\r\nthan they could eat. The Cottenham and Chedder cheeses are said, in a great\r\nmeasure, to derive their celebrity from the cows feeding on this grass.\r\n\r\nIts seeds are small, and are remarkable for their sweet flavour and\r\nnutritious qualities. They are annually collected in Poland, and are\r\nexported thence, into Germany, and other parts of the continent, under the\r\nname of _manna seeds_. These are used in soups, gruel, and puddings, even\r\nby persons of the first rank and consequence. When ground into flour, they\r\nare convertible into bread, which is little inferior to that made of wheat.\r\nThe bran of these seeds is stated by Linnæus to be useful as a medicine for\r\nhorses that are troubled with worms. Geese are fond of the seeds, and well\r\nknow where to find them. It is remarkable that these seeds have hitherto\r\nbeen entirely neglected in England; though without difficulty they might be\r\nobtained in sufficient quantity to prove beneficial.\r\n\r\n49. _The COMMON REED_ (_Arundo phragmites_, Fig. 33) grows in ditches,\r\nponds, and by the sides of rivers, attaining the height of six or seven\r\nfeet, and flowering about the month of July.\r\n\r\nReeds are frequently made into screens or fences for gardens, and they are\r\nconsidered particularly eligible for sheltering tender plants from injury\r\nby cold, or blighting winds. They likewise make excellent _weavers' combs_;\r\nand, when nailed across a frame of wood-work, are frequently employed as a\r\nfoundation for plaster floors. They are sometimes made into chair bottoms;\r\nand into thatch for cottages and out-buildings.\r\n\r\nFrom the flowers of the reed the country people of Sweden extract a green\r\ndye, which they occasionally use for woollen cloth; and we are informed\r\nthat, from the dried roots, a flour may be made, which is capable of being\r\nconverted into a wholesome and nutritive bread.\r\n\r\n50. _SEA MATWEED_ (_Arundo arenaria_, Fig. 34) is an useful and common\r\nplant on most of our sandy sea shores. Its cultivation has, at various\r\ntimes, been much encouraged, and even acts of parliament have been passed\r\nfor its preservation, in consequence of its spreading roots giving\r\nstability to the loose, blowing sand, and thus raising a bulwark against\r\nthe encroachments of the waves. The Dutch are said to have availed\r\nthemselves of the advantage of these plants in securing and rendering firm\r\nseveral parts of their coasts, which would otherwise have suffered much\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nAt Newborough, a town on the south coast of the island of Anglesea, the\r\ninhabitants manufacture this plant into mats and ropes; and the Danes\r\nemploy the fibrous roots for making whisk brushes.\r\n\r\nThe common people of Iceland collect the seeds of the sea matweed for\r\nmaking bread.\r\n\r\n51. _RYE GRASS, or RAY GRASS_ (_Lolium perenne_, Fig. 35), has, of late\r\nyears, been cultivated in some countries, to considerable extent, as fodder\r\nfor cattle. Its agricultural merits were first discovered in Norfolk, and,\r\nthence, the seeds have been distributed through the greater part of the\r\nkingdom; those who purchase them little suspecting that the plant was a\r\nweed in their own fields. In dry pastures, and by road sides, this kind of\r\ngrass is extremely common.\r\n\r\nWhen sown in high or sandy lands, either alone or mixed with clover, it\r\nyields an earlier crop than most other grasses; and thus affords food at a\r\nseason when it is sometimes difficult otherwise to be obtained. The ray\r\ngrass that grows wild is stated to be much superior to that which is\r\nobtained by cultivation; and we are informed that, if sown in a rich and\r\nfertile soil, it will dwindle in a few years to a poor and insignificant\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n52. _COUCH, or SQUITCH GRASS_ (_Triticum repens_, Fig 36), is, in general,\r\nconsidered a troublesome and pernicious weed. The roots strike so deeply\r\ninto the ground, and extend so widely, that the eradicating of them is\r\nfrequently attended with difficulty. As the plant lies upon the ground it\r\nstrikes out fibres from every joint; and so luxuriant is it sometimes seen,\r\nthat a single joint, when transplanted, has, in the course of twelve\r\nmonths, covered a square yard of land.\r\n\r\nThe roots of couch grass are collected in large quantities at Naples, and\r\nsold in the market as food for horses. They have a sweetish taste, somewhat\r\nresembling that of liquorice; and, in times of scarcity, when dried and\r\nground into meal, they have been converted into bread. A decoction of the\r\nroots is sometimes used in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS IV.--TETRANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  53. _TEASEL_ (Dipsacus fullonem) _is a plant, with a somewhat egg-shaped\r\n  head of flowers, and hard reflected scales, which is cultivated in\r\n  several parts of England, to be used in the carding of woollen cloth._\r\n\r\n  _The Fullers Teasel is distinguished from other plants of the same tribe\r\n  by having its leaves connected at the base, the flower scales hooked, and\r\n  the general calyx reflected or bent back._\r\n\r\nThe seeds of this plant are usually sown in strong rich land, about the\r\ncommencement of spring. The flowers appear in July, and the blossoms begin\r\nto decay in the following month. Shortly after this the heads are cut off,\r\nand exposed daily to the sun until they are perfectly dried.\r\n\r\nIn the clothing counties of England the fuller's teasel is an article of\r\nconsiderable importance. The crooked scales accompanying the flowers are so\r\nhard and rough that the heads are employed for raising the nap of woollen\r\ncloths. For this purpose they are either set into flat boards like cards,\r\nor are fixed round the circumference of a large and broad wheel. The former\r\nare used with the hand; and the latter is turned round whilst the cloth is\r\nheld against it.\r\n\r\n  54. _MADDER_ (Rubia tinctorum) _is a rough, trailing plant, that grows\r\n  wild in several parts of the South of Europe, and is much cultivated in\r\n  England and Holland on account of its roots, which are used by dyers and\r\n  calico-printers._\r\n\r\nThe land best adapted for the cultivation of madder is a soft, sandy loam.\r\nWhen the roots have attained sufficient growth, they are taken up,\r\ncarefully peeled, and dried in an airy shed. After this they are conveyed\r\nto a kiln, where they undergo a kind of management somewhat similar to that\r\nadopted in the drying of hops (260). The next process is to pulverize them,\r\nwhich is done by pounding or grinding; a secret that was long exclusively\r\npossessed by the Dutch.\r\n\r\nMadder is extensively used in dyeing, not only on account of its yielding a\r\nfine red colour, but also as forming a first tint for several other shades.\r\nThe madder used for dyeing cottons in the East Indies, is, in some\r\nrespects, different from that cultivated in Europe. And, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Smyrna, and in the island of Cyprus, a kind of madder is\r\ngrown which affords a peculiarly bright and beautiful colour.\r\n\r\nThis root is sometimes employed in medicine, in obstructions of the bowels,\r\nrickets, and a few other complaints. It tinges water a dull red colour, and\r\nspirit of wine a deep bright red. When eaten by animals, it stains even\r\ntheir most solid bones.\r\n\r\nCows are remarkably fond of the madder plant; and when they freely eat of\r\nit their milk becomes red, yet the cream which it affords makes a yellow\r\nbutter,\r\n\r\n  55. _SANDAL WOOD, or YELLOW SAUNDERS, is a yellowish, odoriferous wood,\r\n  which is imported from the East Indies in logs or short pieces, chiefly\r\n  as a perfume, or for the manufacture of ornamental articles._\r\n\r\n  _The tree that produces it_ (Santalum album) _grows principally on the\r\n  coast of Malabar, and in the island of Timor. It has somewhat the\r\n  appearance of a large myrtle, with stiff branches, and smooth, shining,\r\n  spear-shaped leaves, each about two inches long. The flowers grow in\r\n  clusters, small and red, and are succeeded by berries about the size of\r\n  peas._\r\n\r\nWhen the sandal wood trees are cut down they are stripped of their bark;\r\nafter which the wood is usually chopped into billets or small pieces, and\r\nburied in a dry place for about two months. During this time the ants eat\r\nthe outer part of it, without penetrating to the heart, which is the\r\nsandal. The billets are then taken up, smoothed, and sorted; and the deeper\r\nthe colour the higher is found the perfume.\r\n\r\nIn China this elegant wood, when cut into large planks, is sometimes made\r\ninto coffins for the principal persons; and such coffins are said to resist\r\nthe effects of air and moisture for many years. The Chinese also reduce the\r\nwood to powder, and, with the addition of water, convert it into a paste,\r\nwhich they apply to their bodies, their furniture, and about their houses,\r\nas a perfume. The powder of sandal wood is likewise employed as an incense\r\nin their idolatrous temples. Hence it is that a considerable trade in this\r\nwood exists between the East Indies and China.\r\n\r\nBesides the logs, the chips and cuttings of the roots of sandal wood are an\r\narticle of commerce. From these chips, and from the waste wood, an\r\nodoriferous oil is sometimes prepared, which is considered nearly equal in\r\nfragrance to oil of roses.\r\n\r\nSandal wood is at present seldom used in medicine; though, from its\r\npowerful qualities, it might probably be applied to many medicinal purposes\r\nwith success. It has a bitterish aromatic taste, accompanied by a degree of\r\npungency which is by no means unpleasant,\r\n\r\n\r\nTETRAGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  56. _HOLLY_ (Ilex aquifolium) _is a small evergreen tree, with shining,\r\n  irregular, and spinous leaves, and white flowers which grow in clusters\r\n  round the branches, and are succeeded by small red berries._\r\n\r\nIn those parts of the country where hollies are very abundant they afford a\r\ncheerfulness to the scenery in winter which is extremely pleasing. It is on\r\nthis account principally that they are planted in gardens and shrubberies.\r\nThe barbarous taste of our ancestors was such that they frequently clipped\r\nthem into the shape of birds, quadrupeds, and other fantastic\r\nrepresentations of nature.\r\n\r\nAs a fence, holly is eminently serviceable. When formed into hedges, it\r\nadmits of being cropped, and retains its verdure and beauty, without\r\ninjury, even through the severest winters. Its growth is slow, and its\r\nduration longer than that of most other trees. The _wood_, which is hard\r\nand close-grained, is much used in veneering, and is frequently stained\r\nblack, to imitate ebony. It is likewise advantageously used in making\r\nhandles for knives, cogs for mill-wheels, and other articles. The _leaves_\r\nin winter afford a grateful food to sheep and deer; and the _berries_ yield\r\na subsistence, during this inclement season, to the feathered tribes. In\r\nsome places, particularly in the island of Corsica, the inhabitants employ\r\nthe seeds of holly for making a beverage somewhat similar, but much\r\ninferior, to coffee.\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ of the holly is smooth, and replete with a strong mucilaginous\r\nsubstance, from which the article called _bird-lime_ is made. For this\r\npurpose it is boiled ten or twelve hours; and, when the green rind is\r\nseparated, it is covered up in a moist place, to stand for a fortnight. It\r\nis afterwards reduced to a tough paste, and washed in a running stream\r\nuntil no impurities are left. The next part of the process is to suffer it\r\nto ferment for four or five days; after which it is mixed, over the fire,\r\nwith a third part of nut-oil (241), or some other oily fluid, and is thus\r\nrendered fit for use.\r\n\r\nBird-lime has a remarkably adhesive quality, particularly to feathers and\r\nother dry substances. It is, on this account, employed for the smearing of\r\ntwigs to ensnare birds. In its elasticity and inflammable nature it has\r\nmuch resemblance to Indian rubber; and, if any means could be adopted to\r\nharden it, there is little doubt but it might be substituted for that\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nHolly deserves to be much more extensively cultivated than it is. Some\r\nyears ago a person who purchased a holly wood in Yorkshire, sold the\r\nbird-lime prepared from the bark to a Dutch merchant, for nearly the whole\r\nsum of his original purchase.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Romans it was customary to send branches of holly, to\r\ntheir friends, with new years' gifts, as emblematical of good wishes. We\r\ndecorate our houses and churches with it at Christmas, to give, as it has\r\nbeen observed, an air of spring in the depth of winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS V.--PENTANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  57. _ALKANET is a dyeing drug, the bark of a root which produces a rough\r\n  plant_ (Anchusa tinctoria), _with downy and spear-shaped leaves, and\r\n  clusters of small purple or reddish flowers, the stamens of which are\r\n  shorter than the corolla._\r\n\r\nThough this plant is sometimes cultivated in England, by far the greater\r\nportion of the alkanet which we use is imported either from the Levant, or\r\nfrom the neighbourhood of Montpelier in France.\r\n\r\nAlkanet imparts a fine deep red colour to all unctuous substances, and to\r\nspirits of wine; but it tinges water with a dull, brownish hue. Its chief\r\nuse is for the colouring of oils, plasters, lip-salve, and other similar\r\narticles. It is likewise employed in compositions for rubbing, and giving\r\ncolour to mahogany furniture. Wax tinged with alkanet, and applied to the\r\nsurface of warm marble, stains it flesh colour, and sinks deep into the\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n  58.  _The COWSLIP is a plant_ (Primula veris) _which grows in most\r\n  meadows and pastures, and is too well known to require any description._\r\n\r\nThe _flowers_ of the cowslip, when picked and dried, are sometimes used as\r\na balsamic tea. When boiled, with a certain proportion of water and sugar,\r\nand afterwards properly fermented, they may be made into a peculiarly\r\npleasant wine.\r\n\r\nThe _roots_ have a fine odour; and, when immersed in ale or beer, are said\r\nto add considerably to the strength of the liquor. The _leaves_ are\r\nsometimes eaten as a pot-herb, and in salads; and both the leaves and\r\nflowers are an excellent food for silk-worms.\r\n\r\n  59.  _BUCK-BEAN, or BOG-BEAN_ (Menyanthes trifoliata), _is a common plant\r\n  in shallow ponds; and is distinguishable by its leaves growing in threes,\r\n  and its pink and white flowers being shaggy on their inner surface._\r\n\r\nThere is no British plant the flowers of which are more beautiful than\r\nthose of buck-bean; and nothing but the difficulty of propagating it in dry\r\nground could prevent its having a place in every garden. The _leaves_ are\r\nintensely bitter, and are occasionally used in the Highlands of Scotland as\r\na tea, to strengthen the stomach. The inhabitants of some parts of Sweden\r\nemploy them in place of hops, to impart a bitter taste to ale; two ounces\r\nof them being considered equal in strength to a pound of hops. By some\r\npersons the leaves of buck-bean are smoked instead of tobacco; and\r\ndifferent preparations of this plant have been found efficacious as a\r\nremedy against agues, and in scorbutic and scrofulous diseases,\r\nrheumatisms, and dropsy. There is an opinion that sheep, when compelled to\r\neat of buck-bean, are cured of the rot. In Lapland it is said that the\r\npounded roots, though very unpalatable, are sometimes converted into bread.\r\n\r\n  60. _SCAMMONY is a concrete or dried juice obtained from the roots of a\r\n  climbing plant of the convolvulus tribe_ (Convolvulus scammonia, Fig. 7,)\r\n  _which is cultivated in Asiatic Turkey, Syria, and Persia._\r\n\r\n  _This plant is known by having arrow-shaped leaves, notched in a\r\n  particular manner at the base, and each flower-stalk bearing two or three\r\n  large and somewhat purplish white flowers._\r\n\r\nThe roots of the scammony plant are thick, black on the surface, white\r\nwithin, and full of an acrid milky juice, which, in a concrete state, is\r\nfrequently used in medicine. To obtain it, the earth, at a certain season\r\nof the year, is removed from the upper part of the roots whilst they are\r\ngrowing, and the tops are cut obliquely. The juice flows from the wound\r\ninto a small vessel sunk into the earth, at the lower end of the gash, to\r\nreceive it. But, as each root furnishes only a very small quantity, the\r\nproduce of several roots is usually mixed together for the greater\r\nconvenience of being exposed to the sun and dried. Still, however, the\r\nquantity, thus obtained, is sometimes insufficient to supply the demand. In\r\nthis case an addition is made to it by the pressure of juice from the\r\nleaves and stalks.\r\n\r\nThe best scammony is imported from Aleppo, in light, spongy, friable\r\npieces, of shining blackish grey colour, which have a faint, unpleasant\r\nsmell, and a bitterish, pungent taste. It is sometimes adulterated with\r\nflour, and sometimes even with sand or earth.\r\n\r\nIn its medical effects, scammony, when administered alone, is an\r\nefficacious, though violent purgative. But if triturated or ground down\r\nwith sugar, almonds, or gum-arabic, its operation becomes sufficiently mild\r\nand safe.\r\n\r\n  61. _JALAP is a dark-coloured root, which is usually imported, in\r\n  transverse slices, from South America._\r\n\r\n  _The plant that produces it_ (Convolvulus jalapa, Fig. 8) _belongs to the\r\n  convolvulus tribe, and has generally somewhat heart-shaped leaves, and\r\n  flowers that are reddish on the outside, and dark purple or yellowish\r\n  within._\r\n\r\nThe name of jalap is derived from Xalapa, a town in South America, situated\r\nbetwixt Vera Cruz and Mexico, where the plant, of which it is the root, was\r\noriginally discovered, and whence it has been imported, in great\r\nquantities, into Europe. The jalap plant is now cultivated in the botanical\r\ngarden at Charlestown, and in several other parts of America. When recent,\r\nthe root is large, whitish, and full of juice; but, when dried, the best\r\npieces are compact, hard, weighty, and of dark colour, with black circular\r\nmarks. Both in smell and taste it is very nauseous. It is frequently mixed\r\nwith slices of bryony root; but these are easily distinguished by their\r\npaler colour and porous texture.\r\n\r\nThe only mode in which this root is of use is as a medicine; and it is\r\nadministered in substance, in a tincture, and an extract. It has been\r\nadvantageously employed in several disorders; but, as it is very powerful\r\nin its effects, great caution is necessary in the use of it, particularly\r\nwith children.\r\n\r\n  62. _PERUVIAN BARK is the produce of a tree which grows in South America,\r\n  and chiefly in Peru, whence its name has been derived._\r\n\r\n  _This tree_ (Cinchona officinalis), _in size and general appearance,\r\n  somewhat resembles our cherry-tree. Its leaves are in pairs, oval,\r\n  pointed, nerved, and smooth on the upper side; and the flowers hang in\r\n  loose clusters, are fringed at the edges, and red in the inside_ (Fig.\r\n  10.)\r\n\r\nFormerly this valuable medicine had the name of _Jesuit's bark_, from its\r\nhaving been first introduced into Europe by some persons of the religious\r\norder called Jesuits, that were settled in South America. They had been\r\ninstructed in the use of it by the inhabitants of Peru, to whom it had long\r\nbeen known; and it continued, for many years, to be a lucrative article of\r\ncommerce to them. For its officinal name of cinchona it was indebted to the\r\nlady of a Spanish Viceroy, the Countess del Cinchon, who, about 170 years\r\nago, derived great benefit from taking it.\r\n\r\nThe tree from which it is obtained grows spontaneously, and in great\r\nabundance, in several of the mountainous forests of Quito and Peru. The\r\nproper time for cutting it is from September to November, the only season\r\nduring which there is any considerable intermission from rain. The Indians,\r\nas soon as they have discovered a spot where the trees are in sufficient\r\nnumber, build a few huts for themselves, and one large hut for containing\r\nthe bark, to preserve it from wet. They then go forth, each furnished with\r\na large knife, and a bag which will hold about fifty pounds' weight of\r\nbark. Each tree occupies two men. They first cut or slice down the bark as\r\nfar from the ground as they can reach. They then tie to the tree several\r\nsticks a little distance apart, and each about half a yard in length, to\r\nserve as a ladder by which they can ascend to the upper part, always\r\nslicing off the bark as far as they can reach, before they fix a new step.\r\nIn this manner one of the two mounts to the top, whilst the man below\r\ncollects what his companion cuts. To relieve each other, they ascend the\r\ndifferent trees by turns; and they are generally able to fill their bags\r\nonce in the course of the day. When they return to their huts, they spread\r\nout the bark to dry, and they are very careful to preserve it from wet,\r\nwhich would greatly injure it.\r\n\r\nThere are three sorts of bark in use: the _pale_, the _red_, and the\r\n_yellow_. Of these the two last have recently been discovered. The red is\r\nnow very scarce, and is seldom brought into Europe. The pale bark is\r\nimported, from the Spanish Main, in large bundles, closely packed in goat\r\nor other skins. The yellow is in much larger pieces, and flatter and\r\nthicker than those of the pale bark.\r\n\r\nWe are informed, by some writers, that the Peruvians first learned the use\r\nof this bark from observing certain animals, affected with intermittent\r\nfevers, instinctively led to it. Others say that one of the inhabitants of\r\nPeru, having an ague, was cured by drinking the water of a pool into which\r\nsome trees of this kind had accidentally fallen. On its first introduction\r\ninto Europe, its use was opposed by many eminent physicians; and, for a\r\nlong time afterwards, it was believed to be a very dangerous remedy. Its\r\ncharacter, however, in process of time, became perfectly established, and\r\nit is now considered one of the most valuable medicines we possess.\r\n\r\nPeruvian bark is used as a remedy in intermittent fevers or agues; and, by\r\nsome persons, is prescribed in other kinds of fevers, in confluent\r\nsmall-pox, in gangrenous sore throat, and indeed in every species of\r\ngangrene. It is given in powder, as an extract, a spirituous tincture, and\r\na decoction; but the most efficacious form is that of powder. In taste it\r\nis bitter and astringent, leaving an impression upon the palate which\r\ncontinues for some time afterwards; but its smell is rather agreeable than\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n  63. _COFFEE is the seed of an evergreen shrub which is cultivated in hot\r\n  climates, and is chiefly imported from Arabia and the East and West\r\n  Indies._\r\n\r\n  _This shrub_ (Coffea Arabica, Fig. 9) _is from fifteen to twenty feet in\r\n  height. The leaves are four or five inches long, and two inches broad,\r\n  smooth, green, and glossy on the upper surface; and the flowers, which\r\n  grow in bunches at the base of the leaves, are white and sweet-scented.\r\n  The berries or fruit are of a somewhat oval shape, about the size of a\r\n  cherry, and of dark red colour, when ripe. Each of these contains two\r\n  cells, and each cell has a single seed, which is the coffee as we see it\r\n  before it undergoes the process of roasting._\r\n\r\nCoffee is an article of only late introduction. To the Greeks and Romans it\r\nwas wholly unknown. Its use appears to have originated in Ethiopia; and, in\r\n1554, it is stated to have been first introduced into Constantinople,\r\nwhence it was gradually adopted in the western parts of Europe. In 1652 Mr.\r\nDaniel Edwards, a Turkey merchant, brought with him to England a Greek\r\nservant, whose name was Pasqua, and who understood the methods of roasting\r\ncoffee, and making it into a beverage. This man was the first who publicly\r\nsold coffee in this country; and he kept a house for that purpose in George\r\nYard, Lombard Street. At Paris, coffee was nearly unknown until the arrival\r\nof the Turkish ambassador, Solomon Aga, in 1669; about three years after\r\nwhich the first coffee-house is said to have been established in that city.\r\nThe coffee shrub was originally planted in Jamaica in 1732.\r\n\r\nGreat attention is paid to the culture of coffee in Arabia. The trees are\r\nraised from seed sown in nurseries, and afterwards planted out, in moist\r\nand shady situations, on sloping grounds, or at the foot of mountains. Care\r\nis taken to conduct little rills of water to the roots of the trees, which\r\nat certain seasons require to be constantly surrounded with moisture. As\r\nsoon as the fruit is nearly ripe, the water is turned off, lest the fruit\r\nshould be rendered too succulent. In places much exposed to the south, the\r\ntrees are planted in rows, and are shaded from the otherwise too intense\r\nheat of the sun, by a branching kind of poplar tree. When the fruit has\r\nattained its maturity, cloths are placed under the trees, and, upon these,\r\nthe labourers shake it down. They afterwards spread the berries on mats,\r\nand expose them to the sun to dry. The husk is then broken off by large and\r\nheavy rollers of wood or iron. When the coffee has been thus cleared of its\r\nhusk, it is again dried in the sun, and lastly winnowed with a large fan,\r\nfor the purpose of clearing it from the pieces of husks with which it is\r\nintermingled. A pound of coffee is generally more than the produce of one\r\ntree; but a tree in great vigour will produce three or four pounds.\r\n\r\nThe best coffee is imported from Mocha, a town on the eastern bank of the\r\nRed Sea. This, which in Europe is called _Mocha_ and _Turkey coffee_, bears\r\na higher price than any which our colonists are able to raise; owing, as it\r\nis supposed, to the difference of climate and soil in which it is grown. It\r\nis packed in large bales, each containing a number of smaller bales; and,\r\nwhen good, it appears fresh, and of a greenish olive colour. The coffee\r\nnext in esteem to this is grown in Java and the East Indies, and that of\r\nlowest price in the West Indies. When stowed in ships with rum, pepper, or\r\nother articles, it is said that coffee contracts a rank and unpleasant\r\nflavour, and this has been assigned as a reason of the inferiority of such\r\nas is imported from our own plantations.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of coffee annually supplied by Arabia is supposed to be\r\nupwards of fourteen millions of pounds. Before the commencement of the\r\nFrench Revolution the island of St. Domingo alone exported more than\r\nseventy millions of pounds per annum.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the Mahometans drink coffee at least twice a day, very hot, and\r\nwithout sugar. The excellence of coffee depends, in a great measure, on the\r\nskill and attention that are exercised in the roasting of it. If it be too\r\nlittle roasted, it is devoid of flavour; and if too much, it becomes acrid,\r\nand has a disagreeable burnt taste. In England the operation of roasting is\r\nusually performed in a cylindrical tin box, perforated with numerous holes,\r\nand fixed upon a spit which runs lengthwise through the centre, and is\r\nturned by a jack.\r\n\r\nIn a medical view, coffee is said to be of use in assisting digestion,\r\npromoting the natural secretions, and preventing or removing a disposition\r\nto drowsiness. It has been found highly beneficial in relieving some cases\r\nof severe head-ach.\r\n\r\nThe outer pulpy part of the berry, and the inner membrane, which\r\nimmediately invests the seeds, are used by the Arabians, and of these the\r\nformer is much esteemed, and constitutes what is called _coffee à la\r\nsultane_.\r\n\r\n  64. _STRAMONIUM, or THORN-APPLE_ (Datura stramonium), _is an annual\r\n  plant, with thick round stalks, somewhat triangular leaves, jagged or\r\n  toothed at the edges, large white and funnel-shaped flowers, and seed\r\n  vessels large and beset with spines._\r\n\r\nAlthough originally a native of America, stramonium is now a frequent weed\r\non dunghills, and in cultivated ground of our own country; and, when once\r\nintroduced into a garden, it is difficult to be eradicated. Its smell is\r\nexceedingly unpleasant, and its qualities are so pernicious, when taken\r\ninternally, as to occasion giddiness, torpor, and sometimes even death. The\r\nseeds are particularly injurious. Notwithstanding this, the inspissated or\r\ndried juice of the leaves has been considered a valuable remedy in\r\nepileptic and other convulsive disorders. An ointment prepared from them\r\naffords relief in external inflammations; and smoking the dried leaves has\r\nlately been recommended in asthmatic complaints.\r\n\r\nThe soporiferous and intoxicating qualities of stramonium are well known in\r\neastern countries, and have often occasioned the plant to be employed for\r\nvery improper uses.\r\n\r\n  65. _TOBACCO, in the state that we see it, is a narcotic drug formed from\r\n  the dried leaves of an annual plant_ (Nicotiana tabacum, Fig. 11) _that\r\n  is principally cultivated in North America,_\r\n\r\n  _The stalk of the tobacco plant is erect, strong, round, and hardy. The\r\n  leaves are large, oblong, pointed, clammy, and of pale green colour. The\r\n  flowers, which terminate the stem and branches in loose clusters, are of\r\n  reddish colour, and funnel shaped, with a long hairy tube; and the seed\r\n  vessel is oval, and divided into two cells, that contain many rounded\r\n  seeds._\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tobacco is carried on to great extent in several parts\r\nof North America. The seed, mixed with ashes on account of its smallness,\r\nis sown a little before the beginning of the rainy season;  and, in order\r\nthe better to cover it, the beds are raked over or trampled upon. In about\r\na fortnight the young plants begin to appear, and, as soon as they have\r\nfour leaves, they are drawn up and transplanted in lines, and about three\r\nfeet asunder, into the tobacco field. Here they are kept clear of weeds;\r\nand, as soon as they have eight or nine leaves each, the tops are nipped\r\noff to make the leaves grow thicker and longer. When the plants are full\r\ngrown, and the leaves are become somewhat brittle, they are cut with a\r\nknife close to the ground. They are suffered to lie upon the ground for a\r\nlittle while, after which they are carried to the drying shed, where they\r\nare hung by pairs upon lines or ropes. When perfectly dry, the leaves are\r\nstripped from the stalks, and made into small bundles tied round with\r\nanother leaf. These bundles are laid in heaps, and covered with blankets\r\nfor about seven days to heat; after which they are closely stowed in casks\r\nfor exportation.\r\n\r\nThe name of tobacco was given to this article from its having been\r\noriginally brought into Europe from Tobago, or Tabago, an island in the Bay\r\nof Panama, near the coast of America.\r\n\r\nTo the American Indians the use of tobacco has been known for many\r\ncenturies; and the practice of _smoking_ it is common to almost all the\r\ntribes. Tobacco forms a part of every entertainment; and, in the intervals\r\nof hunting, sleeping, and eating, it occupies no small portion of their\r\ntime. In many of their religious ceremonies tobacco is used; and instances\r\nhave occurred in which they have taken it in such quantity that death has\r\nensued.\r\n\r\nThe custom of smoking is understood to have been first introduced into\r\nEngland, by Sir Walter Raleigh, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and a\r\nludicrous story has often been told respecting it: that Sir Walter having\r\ndirected a servant to bring him a jug of water, the man, at his return into\r\nthe room, found him smoking, and, alarmed at seeing his master apparently\r\non fire, threw the whole contents of the jug into his face to quench it.\r\n\r\nSo extensive has this nauseous practice now become, especially in Holland\r\nand Germany, that it constitutes a daily luxury with nearly all the\r\npeasantry of those countries, as well as with the more indolent and wealthy\r\nclasses of the inhabitants. To many constitutions it is very injurious.\r\nWhen first begun, it occasions vomiting, intoxication, and other unpleasant\r\neffects. These however, by repetition, are discontinued, though its\r\nstupifying qualities are never entirely overcome.\r\n\r\nAnother form under which tobacco is used, is that of _snuff_. The basis of\r\nsnuff is tobacco powdered;  but many other matters are added, to give it a\r\npeculiar smell, or to impart pungency to it. When first applied to the\r\nnose, snuff excites sneezing, but, by repetition, this entirely ceases. The\r\npractice of taking snuff has, in some instances, been found injurious to\r\nthe smell and the voice; it has been attended with loss of memory, and by\r\nsymptoms of a weakened or debilitated state of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nBut there is no mode of using tobacco so disgusting, to persons\r\nunaccustomed to it, as chewing. By the labouring classes, and particularly\r\nby mariners, this practice is chiefly followed, from a notion, though\r\napparently a very erroneous one, that it will prevent the return of hunger,\r\nand, in some degree, supply a lack of food.\r\n\r\nThough all these are disgusting as practices, there is no doubt, but,\r\nmedicinally, they may be attended with good effects. By smoking and\r\nchewing, tooth-ach has often been relieved; and some persons consider the\r\nformer a means of guarding against contagion. The occasional and moderate\r\nuse of snuff has, in several cases, been found beneficial, particularly in\r\nhead-achs, and in diseases of the eyes and ears. Infusions of tobacco are\r\nsometimes administered in medicine, but this drug is principally given in\r\nthe form of a vinous or watery infusion. Tobacco is a powerful medicine,\r\nand requires to be used with great caution. The smoke of this herb, when\r\nblown against noxious insects, destroys them, and is the means which\r\ngardeners adopt for ridding hot-houses and green-houses of such as infest\r\ntheir plants.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant is sufficiently hardy to sustain the rigour of an\r\nEuropean climate, and is cultivated in several parts of Spain and Portugal.\r\nAs however, on importation, it pays a heavy tax to government, the culture\r\nof it in this country is restricted, by the legislature, to half a rod of\r\nground in _physic gardens_; and if this be exceeded the cultivator is\r\nliable to a penalty of ten pounds for every rod.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of tobacco and snuff are attributable rather to the\r\ndifference of climate and soil in which the plants have been grown, and to\r\nthe different modes of management and manufacture, than to any essential\r\ndistinction in the plants from which they are manufactured.\r\n\r\n  66. _DEADLY NIGHTSHADE_ (Atropa belladonna) _is an extremely poisonous\r\n  plant, which grows in hedges and waste grounds, in several parts of\r\n  England, and has somewhat oval leaves of dull green colour, purple\r\n  bell-shaped flowers, and shining black berries, each about the size of a\r\n  small cherry._\r\n\r\nThere is no British plant so injurious in its effects on the human frame as\r\nthis; and the alluring appearance and sweetish taste of the _berries_ have,\r\nin many instances, particularly with children, been succeeded by the most\r\nfatal consequences. It is true that some persons have been known to eat\r\nthree or four of them without injury; but in others a single berry, and\r\neven the half of one, has occasioned death. The _leaves_ are more powerful\r\nthan the berries. The usual symptoms of this poison are a deep and deadly\r\nstupor, giddiness, delirium, great thirst, retching, and convulsions. A\r\ndraught of vinegar, and keeping the patient constantly in motion, are said\r\nto be the best means of cure.\r\n\r\nSome writers have supposed it was the deadly nightshade which produced\r\nthose strange and dreadful effects that are described by Plutarch to have\r\nbeen experienced by the Roman soldiers, under the command of Antony, during\r\ntheir retreat from the Parthians:--\"Their distress for provisions was so\r\ngreat that they were compelled to eat of plants unknown to them. Among\r\nothers, they found an herb of which many ate; these, shortly afterwards,\r\nlost their memory and their senses, and wholly employed themselves in\r\nturning over all the stones they could find; then, being seized with\r\nvomiting, they fell down dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe _leaves_ of the deadly nightshade have sometimes been used externally,\r\nand with good effect, in cases of cancer; and in ulcers and tumours of\r\ndifferent kinds. They are likewise given, internally, in infusion; but the\r\nsufferings of the patient, however small the dose may be, are so dreadful\r\nthat few practitioners like to resort to them.\r\n\r\n  67. _POTATOE_ (Solanum tuberosum) _is a well known edible root, which was\r\n  originally imported into this country from America._\r\n\r\nNo root with which we are acquainted is so valuable to mankind in temperate\r\nclimates, as the potatoe. In some countries, particularly in Ireland, it\r\nforms a most important article of food to the lower classes of inhabitants.\r\nBy the English peasantry the potatoe is by no means esteemed as it\r\ndeserves. In addition to its value for culinary uses, it might, in a very\r\nessential degree, be made to serve as a substitute for bread. If duly\r\nprepared, and mixed with a nearly equal portion of wheat flour, it may even\r\nbe made into loaves. A kind of cheese may be made, by reducing potatoes to\r\nthe consistence of paste, adding an equal quantity of the curd from which\r\ncheese is made, with a little salt and some other ingredients, mixing the\r\nwhole together, and forming them in moulds. The Germans prepare a favourite\r\ndish by slicing boiled potatoes and pouring over them the same kind of\r\nsauce which is used for salads, and mixing anchovies with them.\r\n\r\nThese roots afford an excellent food for horses and cattle; and it is said\r\nthat bullocks will fatten on them more speedily than on cabbages or\r\nturnips. Potatoes are likewise serviceable for the fattening of hogs; but,\r\nfor a little while before these are killed, it is requisite to use barley\r\nmeal in addition, as otherwise the fat of the bacon is liable to boil away\r\nin the cooking. In the use of potatoes as food, it is requisite to prepare\r\nthem in some manner by heat, as otherwise they are both unpalatable and\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nA kind of brandy was formerly distilled from potatoes; but this has been\r\nforbidden by the legislature. Starch may be made from potatoes, by the\r\nsimple process of scraping them in water, and well washing the pulp: the\r\nstarch settles to the bottom of the vessel, in a heavy and closely\r\nconnected sediment. This starch is of use for the same purposes as starch\r\nprepared from wheat: it is also valuable as a size; which, unlike the size\r\nproduced from animal substances, does not easily putrefy, and has no\r\ndisagreeable smell. Bakers in Germany, by the addition of calcined oyster\r\nshells and burnt hartshorn, convert the pulp of potatoes into yeast. The\r\n_stalks_ or haulm of potatoes are capable of being made into paper. They\r\nare also of considerable utility as manure. The _apples_, or seed-vessels,\r\nmay be usefully employed as a pickle: and, if properly prepared, they are\r\nsaid to be even more palatable than cucumbers.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous varieties of the potatoe. Of these the most remarkable\r\nare the different kinds of _kidney potatoes_, the _Aylesbury white_, and\r\n_Altringham early white_, which are chiefly grown for the table; the _ox\r\nnoble_, _Irish purple_, and _red potatoes_, which are adapted for fodder.\r\n\r\nThis valuable root was originally imported from America, about the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century. The inhabitants of Ireland assert\r\nthat it was first introduced into that country, by the accidental wreck,\r\nupon their coast, of a vessel which was laden with potatoes and freighted\r\nfor England.\r\n\r\nThe usual mode of planting potatoes is by cutting the roots into pieces,\r\nreserving one eye or bud to each division, and setting these in the earth.\r\nThey will succeed in any tolerable soil; but they flourish most luxuriantly\r\nin light sandy loams. The proper time for digging them up is during dry\r\nweather in autumn, when the leaves and stems begin to decay. When\r\ncultivated on a small scale, they are usually dug with a three pronged\r\nfork; but when raised in fields, where this process would be too tedious,\r\nthey are turned up by a plough.\r\n\r\n  68. _CAPSICUMS are South American and Indian plants easily known by their\r\n  hollow pods, of shining red or yellow colour, which contain many small,\r\n  flat, and kidney-shaped seeds._\r\n\r\n  _The principal species are, Heart or Bell pepper_ (_Capsicum grossum_),\r\n  _Guinea pepper_ (_Capsicum annuum_, Fig. 12), _and Bird pepper_\r\n  (_Capsicum baccatum_).\r\n\r\nAll the species of capsicum possess the same general qualities. In hot\r\nclimates, but particularly in the East and West Indies, and some parts of\r\nSpanish America, the fruit of these plants is much used for culinary\r\npurposes. It is eaten in large quantities, both with animal and vegetable\r\nfood; and is mixed, in greater or less proportion, with almost all kinds of\r\nsauces.\r\n\r\n_Cayenne pepper_ is made from the fruit of different species of capsicum.\r\nThis fruit, when ripe, is gathered, dried in the sun, and then pounded; and\r\nthe powder is mixed with a certain portion of salt, and kept, for use, in\r\nclosely stopped bottles. Of late years Cayenne pepper has been introduced\r\ninto most of the countries of Europe; and it is now very generally used as\r\na poignant ingredient in soups and highly seasoned dishes. Its taste is\r\nextremely acrid, and it leaves a durable sensation of heat on the palate,\r\nwhich is best removed by butter or oil. When taken in small quantity,\r\ncayenne pepper is a grateful stimulant; and, in medicine it is used, both\r\nexternally and internally, to promote the action of the bodily organs when\r\nlanguid or torpid; and it is said to be found efficacious in many gouty and\r\nparalytic cases.\r\n\r\n  69. _The GUINEA PEPPER, or ANNUAL CAPSICUM_ (Fig. 12), _is a slender\r\n  herbaceous plant, with smooth leaves, white flowers, single flower\r\n  stalks, and smooth, shining fruit of oblong shape, and usually of red and\r\n  yellow colour._\r\n\r\nThis plant is a native both of the East and West Indies, and is considered\r\nthe most hardy of the whole tribe of capsicum. In many parts of the South\r\nof Europe, its _fruit_ is eaten green by the peasants at their breakfasts,\r\nand is preferred by them to onions or garlic. The fruit of all the species\r\nmay be rendered useful in domestic economy, either as a pickle, or as\r\ncayenne pepper. For the latter, it may be dried before a fire, and ground\r\nto powder in a common pepper-mill.\r\n\r\n  70. _The BUCK-THORN_ (Rhamnus catharticus) _is a spinous shrub, which\r\n  grows in thickets and hedges, and has clusters of small green flowers,\r\n  globular black berries, and somewhat oval leaves, serrated at the edge._\r\n\r\nAbout the month of September the berries of the buck-thorn begin to ripen;\r\nand, if these are bruised when perfectly ripe, they yield a green tint.\r\nThey are made into the _sap-green_ which is used by painters in\r\nwater-colours, by evaporating their juice to the consistence of a gum. From\r\nthe juice of the unripe berries, mixed with alum, a yellow dye is obtained,\r\nwhich is employed by dyers, and also for staining maps or paper. If the\r\nfruit be gathered late in the autumn the juice is purple. The _syrup_ of\r\nbuck-thorn berries is sometimes used in dropsies and other complaints,\r\nthough there are objections to it from its occasioning sickness and\r\ngriping. The berries have a faint disagreeable smell, and a nauseous bitter\r\ntaste. It is not unusual to mix with, or substitute for them, the fruit of\r\nthe berry-bearing alder, and of the dog-berry tree. The fraud is, however,\r\neasily detected on examination; for the buck-thorn berries have each four\r\nseeds, which the others have not.\r\n\r\nThe _inner bark_ of the buck-thorn is said to yield a medicine preferable\r\nto that afforded by the berries, but it is an extremely powerful one.\r\n\r\n  71. _NUX VOMICA, or VOMIC NUT, is a round, flat seed, about an inch in\r\n  diameter, of greyish brown colour, and horny consistence, the produce of\r\n  a tree_ (Strychnos nux vomica) _which grows in the East Indies._\r\n\r\n  _The tree is of large size, and has somewhat oval leaves, in pairs, each\r\n  marked with three or five strong ribs. The young branches have swelled\r\n  joints. The flowers are in a kind of umbels at the extremity of the\r\n  branches._\r\n\r\nThe _fruit_ which produces the vomic nut is a species of berry, about the\r\nsize of a small apple, and covered with a hard substance somewhat\r\nresembling that of the pomegranate (154), and of beautiful orange colour\r\nwhen ripe. This fruit is filled with a pulp which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThere is so great a consumption of nux vomica, that the quantity vended at\r\nthe East India Company's sales, in 1808, was about five tons' weight, and\r\nits price about nineteen shillings per hundred weight, exclusive of the\r\nduty. It is imagined that public brewers sometimes use this drug in the\r\nadulteration of ale and porter, for the purpose of rendering it more\r\nintoxicating than it otherwise would be.\r\n\r\nIt is employed for the destruction of vermin; and is said to be quickly\r\nfatal to dogs, foxes, wolves, and most other quadrupeds. When pounded and\r\nmixed with oatmeal, it is used for the killing of rats. Yet deleterious as\r\nthis drug is, it has lately been employed on the Continent, as a medicine\r\nof great efficacy, in spasmodic affections of the bowels, and some other\r\ncomplaints; but its administration ought only to be attempted by medical\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAn extract of nux vomica has lately been imported from India; but it is not\r\ngenerally known for what purpose.\r\n\r\n  72. _The TEAK-TREE_ (Tectonia grandis) _is a valuable species of timber,\r\n  which grows in the forests of the East Indies._\r\n\r\n  _This tree attains the height of fifty feet and upwards. Its leaves are\r\n  somewhat oval, slightly scalloped, rough on the upper side, and clad with\r\n  a white down beneath; and its flowers are in bunches, small, white, and\r\n  fragrant._\r\n\r\nFor the building of ships, teak-wood is esteemed superior to every kind of\r\ntimber except oak. It is said to be almost incorruptible in water; and its\r\nbitterness preserves it from the attack of worms. For all the purposes of\r\ncarpentry, teak is the most useful timber that is produced in Asia. It is\r\neasily wrought, and is peculiarly strong and durable. That which grows on\r\nthe coast of Malabar is considered the best; but the greatest quantity is\r\nobtained from Pegu. The former is nearly all hill timber, whereas the\r\nlatter is the produce of a low and flat country. In India much of the\r\nfurniture is made of teak wood.\r\n\r\nThe attention of government has of late been called to the cultivation of\r\nthis timber; and great encouragement is now given to an extensive\r\npropagation of it. In the present scarcity of oak timber in England, the\r\nincrease of teak in the East is become an object of importance to the\r\nprosperity of our navy. Its culture has also been recommended in our West\r\nIndian islands, the climate and soil of which are considered nearly similar\r\nto those of its native country.\r\n\r\n  73. _MANGOS, as they are imported into this country, are the unripe fruit\r\n  of an East Indian tree_ (Mangifera Indica) _pickled in vinegar._\r\n\r\n  _The mango tree grows to a great size, and has spear-shaped leaves, each\r\n  eight or nine inches long, and two inches wide. The flowers spring, in a\r\n  loose kind of bunch, from the extremity of the stems._\r\n\r\nThe _fruit_ of this tree, when ripe, is as large as a goose's egg, and is\r\nmuch esteemed in India, on account of its invigorating odour; which, it is\r\nimagined, will restore health to persons in a declining state. Beneath its\r\nrough shell there is a kernel, similar to that of the almond, which may be\r\neaten either fresh or preserved. From the expressed juice of this fruit the\r\nIndians prepare a kind of wine. When intended for pickling, the fruit is\r\ngathered in an unripe state. An imitation of mangos is made in our own\r\ncountry with a particular sort of melon. A small square piece is cut from\r\nthe side of the melon, through which the seeds are taken out. It is then\r\nfilled with mustard seeds and shred garlic, and afterwards pickled with\r\nvinegar and spices. Large cucumbers are sometimes prepared as mangos.\r\n\r\n  74. _RED CURRANTS are the fruit of a well known shrub_ (Ribes rubum),\r\n  _which is cultivated, in gardens; and which also grows wild in woods or\r\n  thickets of some of the northern parts of England. Its bunches are smooth\r\n  and pendant; and its flowers are flattish._\r\n\r\nThe utility of this fruit in domestic economy has long been established.\r\nIts _juice_, if boiled with an equal weight of loaf sugar, forms an\r\nagreeable substance, called _currant jelly_, which is much employed in\r\nsauces and for other culinary purposes; and also in the cure of sore\r\nthroats and colds. The French frequently mix currant jelly with sugar and\r\nwater, as a beverage; and, by many persons, this mixture is preferred to\r\norgeat or lemonade. The juice of currants is a valuable remedy in\r\nobstructions of the bowels; and, in febrile complaints, it is useful on\r\naccount of its readily quenching thirst, and for its cooling effect on the\r\nstomach. This juice, fermented with a proper quantity of sugar, becomes a\r\npalatable wine, which is much improved by keeping; and which, with care,\r\nmay be kept for twenty years and upwards. Modes of making this, as well as\r\nother British wines, are to be found in all the domestic receipt books.\r\n\r\nThe _inner bark_, boiled with water, is a popular remedy in jaundice; and,\r\nby some medical men, it has been administered in dropsical complaints.\r\n\r\n_White_ and _flesh-coloured currants_ have, in every respect, the same\r\nqualities as the red species.\r\n\r\n  75. _BLACK CURRANTS are the fruit of a garden shrub_ (Ribes nigrum)\r\n  _which is distinguished by having its bunches hairy and its flowers\r\n  oblong._\r\n\r\nThe berries of the black currant shrub are larger than those of the red;\r\nand, in some parts of Siberia, are said to attain the size of a hazel nut.\r\nThey are occasionally made into wine, jelly, and rob or syrup. The two\r\nlatter are frequently employed in the cure of sore throats; and, from the\r\ngreat use of black currants in quinsies, they have sometimes been\r\ndenominated _squinancy_ or _quincy berries_.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are fragrant, and have been recommended for their medicinal\r\nvirtues. An infusion of them, in the manner of tea, is very grateful, and,\r\nby many persons, is preferred to tea. The tender leaves tinge common\r\nspirits so as to resemble brandy; and an infusion of the young _roots_ is\r\nuseful in fevers of the eruptive kind.\r\n\r\nBlack currant trees grow wild in wet hedges, and near the banks of rivers,\r\nin several parts of Norfolk. The _dried currants_ of the shops do not\r\nbelong to this family, but are a small kind of grape (79).\r\n\r\n  76. _GOOSEBERRIES are the fruit of a prickly shrub_ (Ribes grossularia)\r\n  _which grows wild in Cheshire, Lancashire, and several parts of\r\n  Yorkshire._\r\n\r\nFew of the garden fruits are more esteemed for the table than gooseberries.\r\nFor culinary purposes, gooseberries are generally employed before they are\r\nripe; but this is founded on erroneous notions of their chemical\r\nproperties, since, either for sauces or wine, though they are more cool and\r\nrefreshing, they do not possess the delicate flavour and rich saccharine\r\nqualities which are inherent in the ripe fruit. Wine made of gooseberries\r\nhas great resemblance to Champaigne. In the making of wine, after the juice\r\nhas been expressed, it is customary to throw away the _skins_ of the fruit.\r\nThese, however, may with advantage be employed in distillation, as they\r\nafford an agreeable spirit somewhat resembling brandy. When kept a few\r\nmonths, this spirit is said to be little inferior, either in strength or\r\nflavour, to the best Cogniac brandy. Vinegar may be made from gooseberries.\r\nSome of the kinds are bottled while green, and kept for winter use; and\r\nothers are, for the same purpose, preserved with sugar.\r\n\r\nGooseberries vary much in colour, size, and quality. Some are smooth, and\r\nothers hairy. Some are red, others green, and others yellow or amber\r\ncoloured. Wild gooseberries are greatly inferior, in size, to those which\r\nare cultivated in gardens.\r\n\r\n  77. _IPECACUANHA_ (Viola ipecacuanha) _is a medicinal root, small,\r\n  wrinkled, bent, and contorted into a great variety of shapes; which is\r\n  imported from the West Indies and South America, and is given as an\r\n  emetic._\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of ipecacuanha: ash-coloured or grey, brown, and\r\nwhite. Of these, the ash-coloured is usually preferred for medicinal use,\r\nfrom its being more efficacious than the white, and less violent than the\r\nbrown. Ipecacuanha was first brought into Europe towards the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century; but it was not admitted into general use until about\r\nthe year 1686, when it was introduced into practice under the patronage of\r\nLouis the Fourteenth of France. Its taste is bitterish and somewhat acrid;\r\nand it seems to cover the tongue with a kind of mucilage. It is one of the\r\nmildest and safest emetics with which we are acquainted; and is\r\nadministered in powder, as a wine, and as a tincture. It has this peculiar\r\nadvantage, that, if it do not operate as an emetic, it passes off without\r\ninjury by the skin or bowels. In very small doses it is efficacious in\r\nobstinate coughs, and in several other complaints. The roots of a kind of\r\ndogsbane (_Apocynum_) are not unfrequently substituted for those of\r\nipecacuanha; but, in some instances, this substitution has been attended\r\nwith fatal consequences.\r\n\r\n  78. _VINES are a very important tribe of shrubs, to the fruit of which we\r\n  are indebted for all our foreign wines, for raisins of every description,\r\n  and for the dried currants of the shops._\r\n\r\n  _Several species of vine are cultivated; but by far the most important of\r\n  the whole is the common vine_ (Vitis vinifera _of Linnæus_).\r\n\r\nThe earliest introduction of the vine into the western parts of Europe is\r\nstated to have been about the year 280, under the sanction of Probus, the\r\nRoman Emperor, who, throughout his whole dominions, was a zealous\r\nencourager of agricultural pursuits. There can be no doubt that vines were\r\nanciently propagated in our own island for the purpose of wine, and that\r\nthere were vineyards of considerable extent in Gloucestershire, Hampshire,\r\nand some other counties; but, as vines are principally found to flourish in\r\ninland countries, lying betwixt the thirtieth and fifty-first degrees of\r\nlatitude, it is evident that there can be no part of Great Britain\r\nsufficiently adapted to their successful cultivation.\r\n\r\nAny person who has seen a hop garden, may easily form an idea of the\r\nappearance of a _vineyard_. Vines are usually propagated by slips,\r\ncuttings, or offsets from the roots. These, when they have obtained a\r\nsufficiency of roots, are transplanted from the nursery-ground into the\r\nvineyard, the soil of which ought to be light and rich. They are placed, in\r\nthis ground, in rows, and at regular intervals, leaving space sufficient\r\nfor the vine-dressers and the reapers to pass betwixt them; and as soon as\r\nthe rooted plants are three years old, they begin to bear fruit. The season\r\nfor pruning and dressing them is the early part of the year, before the sap\r\nbegins to rise; and about the time when the flowers appear, the plants are\r\nfastened to poles, for the purposes of supporting them, of preventing them\r\nfrom growing entangled with each other, admitting a free circulation of air\r\namongst them, and affording greater convenience for gathering the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe vintage, which is a season of mirth and delight to the whole country,\r\ncommences in the early part of autumn. The villagers assemble in the\r\nrespective vineyards under the direction of overseers. The reaping of the\r\ngrapes is, in general, performed in three distinct gatherings. The first of\r\nthese comprehends all the finest and ripest bunches, carefully clearing\r\naway from them every grape that appears green or decayed: the second is\r\nconfined to the large and thick clusters which are not so ripe as the\r\nothers; and those which are nearly green, withered, or decayed, are\r\ngathered last.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the juice from the grapes, they are subjected to the operation of\r\nlarge presses of somewhat similar construction to the cyder presses of our\r\nown country (the separate gatherings being still kept apart), and the juice\r\nis received into vessels fixed for that purpose. Afterwards it undergoes\r\nthe necessary fermentation to convert it into wine. By the ancients the\r\njuice was obtained by treading the grapes. This practice is alluded to in\r\nvarious parts of Scripture, but perhaps in none are the characteristics of\r\nthe ancient vintage expressed more strongly than in the predictions of\r\nIsaiah concerning Moab: \"And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the\r\nplentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither\r\nshall there be any shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their\r\npresses; I have made their vintage-shouting to cease.\" The treading of\r\ngrapes is still practised in several parts of the world. The ancients\r\nfrequently kept their wine in skins, or leathern bags, well secured at the\r\nseams; hence the passage in the gospels; \"neither do men put new wine into\r\nold bottles; else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the\r\nbottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are\r\npreserved.\"\r\n\r\nThe kinds of wine are extremely various. The difference which exists\r\nbetwixt them is not, however, so much owing to a distinction in the species\r\nof grapes, as in the quality of the fruit, produced by the varieties of\r\nsoil, cultivation, and climate to which they are subject. This difference\r\nlikewise depends, in some instances, on the peculiar mode of fermentation,\r\nand the state of the grapes from which the wine is produced.\r\n\r\n(_a_) PORTUGUESE WINES.--Of all the kinds of wine that are consumed in\r\nEngland, none are so much in request as _red port_. This has its name from\r\nthe city of Oporto, in the neighbourhood of which the vines that produce it\r\nare chiefly cultivated. A great proportion, however, of the port that is\r\nconsumed in England, is said to be mixed with a Spanish red wine of\r\ninferior quality, or to be otherwise adulterated. Red port is brought over\r\nin casks called pipes, which measure 138 gallons each, and ought to fill\r\nfifty-two dozen bottles of legal measure.\r\n\r\nThe difference in colour betwixt red wines and white does not so much\r\ndepend upon the quality of the grape, as upon the mode in which the wines\r\nare prepared. The juice of red grapes, if carefully pressed, and fermented\r\nseparately from the skins, forms a white wine. If the skins be pressed so\r\nas to discharge the colouring matter they contain, or, if they be allowed\r\nto remain in the juice during the fermentation, the wine assumes a red\r\ntinge.\r\n\r\n_White port_, and _Lisbon_, are two kinds of white wine which we receive\r\nfrom Portugal. Of these, the former was much in demand some years ago, but\r\nit is now seldom called for; the latter is still in use.\r\n\r\n(_b_) FRENCH WINES.--Many excellent wines are produced in France. That\r\nusually considered the best is _Burgundy_, a red wine of very delicate\r\nflavour, which has its name from the province where it is made. The wines\r\nof the neighbourhood of Orleans, however, after having been matured by age,\r\nare much like Burgundy. _Claret_ is the only French red wine for which\r\nthere is any great demand in England. It is thin and highly flavoured, and\r\nis chiefly supplied from the neighbourhood of Bourdeaux. Some of the red\r\nwines of Champaigne are highly prized for their excellence and delicacy,\r\nthough they, occasionally, have a pungent and sourish taste. _Hermitage_ is\r\nproduced from vineyards, at a place so called, near the village of Thein,\r\non the eastern bank of the Rhone; and _Côte Rotie_ from vineyards on the\r\nopposite side of the river.\r\n\r\nNo French white wine has so much celebrity as _Champaigne_. This is of two\r\nkinds; one of which, called still or quiet Champaigne, has gone through the\r\nwhole process of fermentation; the other, which has the name of sparkling\r\nChampaigne, has been bottled before the fermentation was complete: this,\r\nconsequently, proceeds slowly in the bottle, and causes the wine, on the\r\ndrawing of the cork, to sparkle in the glass. _Vin de Grave_ is produced in\r\nthe vicinity of Bourdeaux, and the lower parts of Gascoigne: _Pontac_ is\r\nmade in Guienne; and _Frontignac_ and _Muscadel_ are white wines, the\r\ndelicious productions of Languedoc.\r\n\r\n(_c_) SPANISH WINES.--The country about Xeres, in Andalusia, is celebrated\r\nfor a grape which produces an excellent wine called _Sherry_. There are\r\nseveral French and English houses at Xeres and Seville which trade, to\r\ngreat extent, in this wine. It is very strong, and full-bodied, owing, in a\r\ngreat degree, to the quantity of brandy with which it is mixed. In the\r\nprovince of Valencia, some of the proprietors have wines of different\r\nkinds, sixty, eighty, and even a hundred years old, the prices of which\r\ndiffer according to their age. _Rota_, in Seville, produces a rich and\r\nsweet white wine; and the country around _Malaga_, near Gibraltar, is\r\ncelebrated for white wine which is known by that name; and so assiduously\r\nis the cultivation of the vine there pursued, that the export of the\r\nproduce of the vineyards yields to the inhabitants an annual revenue of\r\nmore than 200,000_l._ sterling per annum. We import from Spain a harsh and\r\ninferior kind of _red wine_, which, duty free, sells for only 10_l._ or\r\n15_l._ per pipe of 126 gallons; but the territory of Alicant produces a\r\nvery rich and excellent kind of red wine. The sweet red wine which we call\r\n_Tent_ is a Spanish production; chiefly imported from Cadiz, and in\r\nhogsheads of about sixty gallons each. It is made from the juice of a\r\nparticular kind of grapes, which are not used for this purpose until some\r\ntime after they have been perfectly ripe.\r\n\r\n(_d_) ITALIAN WINES.--Notwithstanding the ancient celebrity of many of the\r\nwines of Italy, by far the greater part of what are now manufactured in\r\nthat country are thin and bad. Certain vineyards on mount Vesuvius,\r\nhowever, still have great celebrity for a luscious red wine called\r\n_Lachryma Christi_.\r\n\r\n(_e_) GERMAN WINES.--Germany produces many excellent wines, of which Tokay,\r\nHock, Rhenish, and Moselle, are the most celebrated. _Tokay_ has its name\r\nfrom a town in Hungary, near which it is chiefly made. The quantity of this\r\nwine is so small that, even on the spot where it is manufactured, it is\r\nsold at a very high price. It is made by mixing with the common grapes a\r\nportion of luscious, half-dried, and shrivelled grapes; the latter being\r\nabsolutely necessary to constitute the peculiar quality of the wine. The\r\ntwo kinds of grapes are pressed separately, and the juice is afterwards\r\nmixed, fermented, and strained through a cloth or sieve into the barrels in\r\nwhich it is to continue. The best Tokay does not long remain in the place\r\nwhere it is made, a great portion of it being sent into the cellars of the\r\nnobility in other parts of Hungary. Tokay is certainly a fine wine, but is\r\nno way adequate to the price for which it is sold. Several years ago it\r\ncould not be purchased, even in Hungary, for much less than half a guinea\r\nof English money per bottle; and yet there are few Englishmen, who, except\r\non account of its scarceness, would prefer it to good Claret or Burgundy.\r\nOf all the German wines, that which is in greatest demand in England is\r\n_Hock_. This has its name from the town of Hochstadt in Suabia, celebrated\r\nfor a great battle which was fought in its neighbourhood by the French and\r\nthe allies in 1704. _Rhenish_ and _Moselle_ are produced chiefly on the\r\nbanks of the rivers Rhine and Moselle, and have a cool, sharp taste, and\r\nconsiderable strength. Anterior to the late wars in Germany, there were\r\nwines in the cellars of many of the noble and wealthy inhabitants of that\r\ncountry which were more than a hundred years old, and of such body as to be\r\nuninjured even by so great an age.\r\n\r\n(_f_) MADEIRA and TENERIFFE WINES.--To the Madeira and Canary islands we\r\nare indebted for some excellent white wines. Of these _Madeira wine_ is\r\nconsidered by far the most valuable, particularly after it has been ripened\r\nby conveyance into a hot climate. The number of pipes of Madeira annually\r\nmade is about 30,000. The grapes, when gathered, are put into wooden\r\nvessels, and the juice is extracted by persons treading upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Canary Islands gave name to a rich white wine, which was formerly in\r\ngreat esteem under the name of _Canary sack_, and is now usually called\r\n_Malmsey Madeira_. The genuine _Malmsey_ wine, which is of sweet and\r\nluscious flavour, and rich golden yellow colour, is the produce of\r\nMalvesia, one of the Greek islands, and thence had originally its name, the\r\nFrench merchants denominating it _Vin de Malvesia_: but so little is now\r\nmade that few persons can possess it. _Teneriffe wine_, when two or three\r\nyears old, has much the flavour of Madeira, but, after this age, it becomes\r\nso sweet and mellow, as somewhat to resemble Malaga.\r\n\r\n(_g_) CAPE WINES.--There are produced, at the Cape of Good Hope, two kinds\r\nof peculiarly rich, sweet, and delicate wine, called _red_ and _white\r\nConstantia_. The farm from which they have their name is situated about\r\neight miles from Cape Town. The grapes of this farm, owing, as it is\r\nsupposed, to some peculiarity in the soil, are superior to any other in the\r\nwhole country. The vintage commences about March or April; and great care\r\nis taken in the manufacture of the wine, no fruit being used but such as is\r\nfully ripe and in the highest perfection. The annual produce is considered\r\nto be about sixty pipes of the red, and 100 pipes of the white wine.\r\nConstantia is in perfection when about two years old; but, when kept six or\r\nseven years, it sparkles in the glass somewhat like wine which has not\r\nundergone a perfect fermentation. What is denominated _Cape Madeira_ is a\r\nlight kind of white wine, the produce of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nConsiderable quantities of this wine are now consumed in England, in\r\nconsequence of the lowness of its price. This is owing to its paying to\r\ngovernment only one-third part of the duty which is imposed on most other\r\nwines.\r\n\r\nThe juice of unripe grapes has a harsh, sour, and rough taste. This, under\r\nthe name of _verjuice_, was formerly much esteemed for culinary and other\r\npurposes. The young twigs of the vine, when dried, cut into small pieces,\r\nand moistened with water, afford a wholesome food for cattle and horses.\r\nThe _leaves_ and _tendrils_ have an astringent taste, which it is probable\r\nthey would impart to British made wines, and thus render them somewhat\r\nsimilar to foreign wines. The _wood_ of the vine, reduced to charcoal, is\r\nused by painters for drawing outlines; and, from the seeds or _stones_, a\r\nkind of oil is sometimes made, which can scarcely be distinguished from\r\nolive oil. These stones, when purified, moderately roasted, and ground to a\r\ncoarse powder, form a tolerable substitute for chocolate.\r\n\r\n_Brandy_ is a spirituous liquor, produced by the distillation of wine; and\r\nprepared in most of the wine countries of Europe. The principal\r\nmanufactories of this spirit are in France, particularly in Languedoc, and\r\nAnjou, whence comes the well-known _Cognac brandy_. The distilleries of\r\nbrandy in Catalonia, in Spain, are so extensive as to yield more than\r\n35,000 pipes per annum. When brandy first issues from the still, it is\r\ncolourless as water; and the colour, which is given to it by the merchants,\r\nis produced partly by the oaken casks in which it is kept, but chiefly by\r\nthe addition of red saunders wood, burnt sugar, and other colouring\r\nmatters. These, however, do not in the least affect the quality of the\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the preceding uses of the vine, we have to add those of its\r\nfruit in a recent state, called _grapes_, as a delicious addition to our\r\ndesserts; and of this fruit, in a dried state, under the appellation of\r\nraisins and currants.\r\n\r\n_Raisins_ are grapes which have been suffered to remain on the trees until\r\nthey are perfectly ripe, and have been dried. They are occasionally dried\r\nin ovens. Sometimes the clusters, being tied several together, are dipped\r\nin a ley of the ashes of rosemary and vine branches, with a certain portion\r\nof slaked lime, and are then dried by exposure to the sun. The best fruit\r\nof this description are the _sun_, and _jar raisins_; both of which are\r\ndried in the sun, without any preparation. These are imported from the\r\nsouthern countries of Europe; and also from the Asiatic provinces of\r\nTurkey. They are principally used for desserts, whilst _Malaga raisins_,\r\nand some other kinds, are employed for culinary purposes and the making of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n  79. _The CURRANTS of commerce are a small kind of raisins, or dried\r\n  grapes, which are produced in the Grecian Archipelago, and particularly\r\n  in the islands of Zante and Cephalonia._\r\n\r\nThe chief plantation of these grapes was anciently in the isthmus of\r\nCorinth, whence they obtained the name of _Corinths_, since corrupted to\r\ncurrants, Few, however, are now produced there, the vineyards having been\r\nneglected in consequence of the jealousy of the Turks not allowing large\r\nvessels to enter the gulf for their exportation. These grapes have no\r\nstones, are usually either of a red or black colour, and when recently\r\ngathered, are an extremely delicious fruit.\r\n\r\nThe harvest commences in the month of August, and as soon as the grapes are\r\nplucked from the trees, they are spread to dry, upon a floor prepared for\r\nthe purpose by stamping the earth quite hard. This floor is formed with a\r\ngentle rising in the middle, that the rain, in case any should fall, may\r\nrun off, and not injure the fruit. When sufficiently dry, the currants are\r\ncleaned, and laid up in magazines, being poured into them through a hole,\r\nand stowed so closely that it is necessary to dig them out with an iron\r\ninstrument. They are packed for exportation in large casks, and by persons\r\nwho have their feet greased in order to tread them close.\r\n\r\nThe principal consumption of currants is in England; but the inhabitants of\r\nthe islands whence they are brought know little of the use we make of them.\r\nThey imagine that we employ them only in the dyeing of cloth, and are\r\nentirely ignorant of our luxury of Christmas pies, and plum puddings. A\r\nsmall but inferior kind of currants are grown in some parts of Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  80. _BEET_ (Beta vulgaris) _is a well known fleshy or succulent root,\r\n  which is cultivated in our kitchen gardens, and grows wild in several\r\n  countries of the south of Europe._\r\n\r\n  _There are two principal varieties of beet, one of which is of deep red\r\n  or purple colour, and the other is white, crossed with bands of red._\r\n\r\nRed beet is principally used at table boiled and cut in slices: it is,\r\nhowever, sometimes pickled, and sometimes stewed with onions; but, if eaten\r\nin great quantity, it is said to be injurious to the stomach. The roots may\r\nbe taken out of the ground for use about the end of August, but they do not\r\nattain their full size and perfection till the month of October. When good\r\nthey are large, and of deep red colour; and, when boiled, they are tender,\r\nsweet, and palatable.\r\n\r\nIt has lately been ascertained that beet roots may be substituted for malt,\r\nif deprived of the greater part of their juice by pressure, then dried, and\r\ntreated in the same manner as the grain intended for brewing. The beer,\r\nmade from beet, has been found perfectly wholesome and palatable, and\r\nlittle inferior to that prepared from malt.\r\n\r\nFrom _white beet_ the French, during the late war, endeavoured to prepare\r\nsugar; that article, as a British colonial produce, having been prohibited\r\nin France. For this purpose, the roots were boiled as soon as possible\r\nafter they were taken from the earth. When cold, they were sliced, and\r\nafterwards the juice was pressed out, and evaporated to the consistence of\r\nsyrup. The sugar was obtained, from this syrup, by crystallization. From\r\n110 pounds' weight of the roots, 41½ pounds of juice were obtained, which,\r\non further evaporation, yielded somewhat more than 4¼ pounds of brown\r\nsugar; and these, by a subsequent operation, produced four pounds of well\r\ngrained white powder sugar. The residuum, together with the syrup or\r\nmolasses which remained, produced after distillation, 3½ quarts of\r\nrectified spirit, somewhat similar to rum.\r\n\r\n  81. _MANGEL WURZEL or ROOT OF SCARCITY, is a plant of the beet tribe_ (_a\r\n  variety of_ Beta cicla) _with large and red veined leaves; those arising\r\n  from the root being on footstalks, and those of the stem being without\r\n  stalks, and the flowers growing in threes._\r\n\r\nThe farmers, in some parts of Germany, cultivate this plant as food for\r\ncattle, and they are said to prefer it, for that use, to potatoes, turnips,\r\ncarrots, and indeed to most other vegetables. It was introduced to the\r\npublic notice in England, by the late Dr. Lettsom; and it has been strongly\r\nrecommended, not only for the feeding of cattle, but also for the use of\r\nman. Both the _leaves_ and _root_ grow to very large size; and the former,\r\nwhich may be eaten as spinach, continue in season long after that plant is\r\nwithered. The root is insipid and unpalatable; but the stalks, and the\r\nstronger middle part of the leaves, may be stewed, or eaten plain-boiled,\r\nas asparagus.\r\n\r\n  82. _BARILLA is the Spanish name of a plant_ (Salsola soda) _from the\r\n  ashes of which is produced the salt called_ kali _or_ soda.\r\n\r\n  _Soda is also procured from the ashes of_ PRICKLY SALTWORT (Salsola\r\n  kali), SHRUBBY SALTWORT (Salsola fructicosa), _and numerous plants of\r\n  other tribes._\r\n\r\nOn the shores of the Mediterranean, where the preparation of soda is\r\npursued to considerable extent, the seeds of the plants from which it is\r\nobtained are regularly sown in places near the sea. When at a sufficient\r\nstate of maturity, the plants are pulled up by the roots, dried, and\r\nafterwards tied in bundles to be burnt. In some places, this is done in\r\novens constructed for the purpose; and in others, in trenches dug near the\r\nsea. The ashes, whilst they are hot, are continually stirred with long\r\npoles, and the saline matter they contain forms, when cold, a solid mass,\r\nalmost as hard as stone. This mass is afterwards broken into pieces of\r\nconvenient size for exportation. The best sort of Spanish soda is in\r\ndark-coloured masses of bluish tinge, very heavy, sonorous, dry to the\r\ntouch, and it externally abounds in small cavities. Its taste is sharp,\r\ncorrosive, and strongly saline.\r\n\r\nSoda is chiefly employed in glass and soap manufactories. See the uses of\r\nminerals, Vol. i. No. 200.\r\n\r\n  83. _ELMS are forest-trees well known in almost every part of England.\r\n  There are several species, of which, however, only three, the_ COMMON ELM\r\n  (Ulmus campestris, Fig. 61,) WYCH HAZEL, _or_ BROAD-LEAVED ELM (Ulmus\r\n  montana, Fig. 62,) _and_ DUTCH ELM (Ulmus suberosa), _grow in this\r\n  country without cultivation_. _They are easily distinguishable from most\r\n  other forest-trees, by their leaves being rough, and doubly serrated at\r\n  the edge._\r\n\r\n  _Of these trees the flowers of the first are four-cleft, and have each\r\n  four stamens, and the fruit is oblong: those of the second are five or\r\n  six cleft, and have each five or six stamens, the fruit is roundish, and\r\n  the leaves are broad; those of the third are four-cleft, and have four\r\n  stamens, and the bark of the branches has a corky appearance._\r\n\r\nThe Dutch elm is grown in most parts of England. The common elm, though\r\nplentiful in Worcestershire, Middlesex, and some other southern counties,\r\nis said to be rare further north than Grantham or Stamford. The wych hazel\r\nis common in woods and hedges throughout the whole of South Britain.\r\n\r\nThe use of the elm as _timber_ is chiefly confined to rough and inferior\r\nwork. Implements of husbandry are almost wholly made of it; and it is\r\nemployed for waggons, carts, mill-wheels, water-pipes, low-priced chairs,\r\nblocks for hat-makers, and various other purposes; and among the lower and\r\nmiddling classes, almost exclusively, for coffins. The preference which it\r\nhas obtained for the latter purpose, is supposed to have originated in its\r\npeculiar durability in moist situations.\r\n\r\nSome of the northern writers state that, from the _inner bark_ of the elm,\r\nif stripped off in the spring, and boiled in water, a very palatable kind\r\nof beer may be brewed; and that this bark, dried and ground to powder, has,\r\nin times of scarcity, been mixed with meal to make bread. It is\r\noccasionally administered as a decoction for obstinate cutaneous\r\ncomplaints; and it has been proposed for use in rheumatism, dropsy, and\r\nother diseases. The young _leaves_ may be used for the feeding of\r\nsilk-worms.\r\n\r\nFew trees are better adapted than the elm for planting in hedge rows, along\r\nthe sides of roads, and along shady walks; but in the latter case the\r\nnumerous suckers which grow up from its roots give much trouble to keep the\r\nground clear.\r\n\r\n  84. _GENTIAN is a bitter drug, the dried root of a plant_ (Gentiana\r\n  lutea) _which grows wild amongst the Alps, and in other mountainous parts\r\n  of the Continent._\r\n\r\n  _The flower-stem of the gentian is two or three feet high, strong,\r\n  smooth, and erect. The leaves which grow upon its lower part are\r\n  spear-shaped and ribbed, and those on the upper part are concave, smooth,\r\n  and egg-shaped. The flowers, which are large and yellow, grow round the\r\n  upper part of the stem on strong footstalks, and are divided at the edge\r\n  into five or more segments. The calyx is a kind of sheath._\r\n\r\nGentian is one of the principal bitters that are now used in medicine; and\r\nis of considerable service in fevers, and in such complaints as arise from\r\nweakness of the stomach. It is externally of a brown colour, and internally\r\nyellowish or bright red. Its taste is at first sweetish, but immediately\r\nafterwards bitter and pungent. As a simple bitter, it is rendered more\r\ngrateful to the stomach by the addition of some warm aromatic; and, for\r\nthis purpose, orange-peel is commonly employed. An extract of gentian root,\r\nboiled with water till it has nearly the consistence of honey, is kept in\r\nthe shops.\r\n\r\n  85. _GARDEN CARROT_ (Daucus carota) _is a plant too well known to need\r\n  any description._\r\n\r\nIn few vegetable productions are the effects of cultivation more\r\nconspicuous than in the carrot. The wild plants, which are common in most\r\nparts of England, have a root so small and woody, that no one could suppose\r\nthey had any alliance whatever to the large and succulent root of the\r\ngarden carrot.\r\n\r\nThe various uses of the carrot in cookery are well known. But, although it\r\ncontains much nutriment, this root is difficult of digestion; particularly\r\nif eaten raw, or imperfectly boiled. Carrots are an excellent fodder for\r\ncattle and horses, either alone or mixed with hay; and, if given to cows,\r\nin winter or the early part of spring, they are said to cause a great\r\nincrease of milk. If carrots be boiled with their wash, hogs will thrive\r\nwell upon them. In some parts of England this vegetable has been cultivated\r\nas a winter food for deer; and the leaves have sometimes been made into\r\nhay. Carrots contain a large proportion of saccharine matter, and various\r\nbut unsuccessful experiments have been made to extract sugar from them.\r\nThey have, however, been more advantageously employed in distillation. Ten\r\npounds' weight of carrots will yield about half a pint of very strong,\r\nardent spirit: and the carrots (twenty tons in weight) produced by an acre\r\nof ground, have been known to produce 240 gallons of spirit. A syrup made\r\nof these roots, and clarified with the white of eggs, has been found useful\r\nfor many purposes. An infusion of the _seeds_ and the expressed juice of\r\nthe roots, are said to afford relief in fits of the gravel. A marmalade of\r\ncarrots has been used with success in sea-scurvy, and a poultice prepared\r\nfrom them is sometimes employed in cancerous ulcers. Crickets are so fond\r\nof these roots that they may easily be destroyed by making a paste of\r\nflour, powdered arsenic, and scraped carrots, and placing this near their\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\n  86. _ROCK SAMPHIRE_ (Crithmum maritimum) _is an umbelliferous plant, with\r\n  fleshy, spear-shaped leaflets, and small but regular-shaped white\r\n  flowers._\r\n\r\nThe cliffs of Dover have long been celebrated for the production of this\r\nvegetable, which has received an additional interest from the notice that\r\nShakspeare has taken of the gathering of it:\r\n\r\n            \"Half-way down\r\n  Hangs one that gathers samphire; dreadful trade!\"\r\n\r\nIt is also found on cliffs of other parts of the south of England, as well\r\nas in Italy, France, and Spain; and generally in inaccessible situations.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of England the _leaves_ of samphire pickled in vinegar are in\r\nuse for the table: they are also used in salads, and for other culinary\r\npurposes. But their place is frequently supplied by a much more common\r\nplant, which grows in salt marshes, and has the name of _marsh samphire_\r\n(_Salicornia_). This, however, is a very inferior substitute, and entirely\r\ndestitute of the fine aromatic flavour of the former species.\r\n\r\n  87. _ASAFOETIDA is a resinous gum, procured from the root of a large\r\n  umbelliferous plant_ (Ferula asafoetida) _which grows in the mountains of\r\n  some parts of Persia._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves of this plant are nearly two feet long, doubly winged, and\r\n  have the leaflets alternate. The flowers are small, and the seeds oval,\r\n  flat, and each marked with three longitudinal lines._\r\n\r\nNo one who has ever smelt the peculiarly powerful, and garlic-like odour of\r\nasafoetida, can well forget it. If exposed to the air, but particularly\r\nwhen heated, it will pervade every apartment of a house. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, it constitutes a favourite seasoning, for food, with the inhabitants\r\nof many of the eastern countries of the world. The Banian Indians, who\r\nnever eat animal food, use it in almost all their dishes; and, before their\r\nmeals, they even rub their mouths with it, to stimulate their appetite. It\r\nis sometimes used by our own cooks, but in very small quantity, in place of\r\ngarlic. In many parts of Arabia and Persia, asafoetida is much esteemed as\r\na remedy for internal diseases, and even as an external application to\r\nwounds; and, with us, it is considered a powerful medicine in several\r\ndisorders. It has been applied with success, in the cure of hooping-cough\r\nand worms; and in flatulent colics, it has, in many cases, afforded great\r\nrelief. It is imported in masses of various sizes and form, and of yellow,\r\nbrown, or bluish colour, sometimes interspersed with roundish white pieces.\r\n\r\nThe plant from the root of which asafoetida is produced grows in the\r\nmountains which surround the small town of Disgnun, in Persia; and, at the\r\nseason when it is collected, the whole place smells of it. The upper part\r\nof the roots, which are sometimes as thick as a man's leg, rises somewhat\r\nabove the surface of the ground. The harvest commences when the leaves\r\nbegin to decay; and the whole gathering is performed by the inhabitants of\r\nthe place, in four different journeys to the mountains. The demand for the\r\narticle in foreign countries being first ascertained to be sufficient for\r\nthe trouble of collecting, the persons employed proceed to the mountains in\r\ncompanies of four or five each. The juice is obtained by cutting the roots\r\nacross, at the same time sheltering them by the leaves (which have been\r\npreviously twisted off) from the intense heat of the sun. Each party takes\r\ninto its care about 2000 plants. After the first incision has been made,\r\nthe roots are suffered to remain untouched for about a month, when they are\r\nagain visited, and the gum which has exuded is taken off. This operation is\r\nrepeated three times, a few days betwixt each; after which the plants are\r\nexhausted and left to die. At the respective gatherings each party\r\ngenerally brings away about fifty pounds' weight of asafoetida. It is\r\nstated that a single ship is exclusively devoted to transporting the bulk\r\nof this commodity to the ports in the Persian Gulf; and that, when smaller\r\nparcels are carried, it is usual to tie them to the top of the mast.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1784, the asafoetida plant was introduced into the Botanic\r\ngarden at Edinburgh, from seeds which had been sent by Dr. Guthrie of\r\nPetersburgh to Dr. Hope.\r\n\r\nThe _ferula tribe_ consists of nine or ten known species of plants, and it\r\nis supposed that asafoetida is yielded by several of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the Levant the sailors are said to use the _stalks_ of a\r\nspecies of ferula to transport fire from one island to another. This custom\r\nis of great antiquity, and explains a passage of Hesiod, who, speaking of\r\nthe fire stolen from heaven by Prometheus, says that he carried it in a\r\nferula. The foundation of this fable is undoubtedly owing to what Diodorus\r\nSiculus informs us of Prometheus, that he was the inventor of the steel\r\nwith which fire is struck from flint; and in all probability that prince\r\nmade use of the pith of the ferula instead of tinder, to convey it from one\r\nplace to another.\r\n\r\n  88. _CORIANDER is a small globular seed, produced by an annual\r\n  umbelliferous plant_ (Coriandrum sativum), _with leaves in slender\r\n  segments, and small whitish flowers, that grows wild in Suffolk and\r\n  Essex, and is cultivated in several parts of England._\r\n\r\nIn several farms in Essex and Kent the cultivation of coriander is pursued\r\nto considerable extent. This is done solely for the seed, which is used by\r\ndistillers, druggists, and confectioners. In some parts of the North of\r\nEurope it is ground and mixed with dough, to give an aromatic flavour to\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nCoriander is usually grown with teasel (53) and caraway (91); but, as\r\nneither of the latter come to perfection until the second year after they\r\nhave been sown, the coriander is harvested without interfering with the\r\nother crops. In this labour, which usually commences about the beginning of\r\nJuly, women and children are principally employed: and, to prevent the\r\nseeds of the largest and best plants from being shed and lost, each stem is\r\ncut separately. The stems are then carried into some convenient part of the\r\nfield, and threshed all together upon a sail cloth.\r\n\r\nSo luxuriantly, and, at the same time, so abundantly does this plant grow\r\nin a wild state, in some of the southern parts of Europe, as almost to\r\nchoke the growth of wheat and other grain. Every part of it, except the\r\nseed, has a fetid and disagreeable smell. The seeds, when taken in large\r\nquantities, have been considered injurious; but Dr. Withering states, that\r\nhe has known six drams of them taken without any remarkable effect.\r\n\r\n  89. _PARSNIP is the root of an umbelliferous plant_ (Pastinaca sativa),\r\n  _with winged and serrated leaves, and small yellow flowers, which is\r\n  cultivated in kitchen gardens, and which also grows wild on the borders\r\n  of ploughed fields in several parts of England._\r\n\r\nThe wild and cultivated parsnips differ much from each other, but\r\nparticularly in the roots of the latter being large and succulent, and\r\nthose of the former being slender and woody.\r\n\r\nParsnips are propagated by seed sown in February or March, and the roots\r\nare in perfection about October. These, besides their use as a vegetable\r\nfor the table, are of great value for the feeding of cattle, horses, sheep,\r\nand hogs. Land in Guernsey, which lets for 7_l._ an acre, is sown with\r\nparsnips to feed cattle; and the milk of the cows so fed is not only richer\r\nthan it would otherwise be, but yields butter of fine saffron colour and\r\nexcellent taste.\r\n\r\nIf parsnips be washed clean, and sliced among bran, horses will eat them.\r\nThey will fatten sheep and oxen in a short time; and for the feeding of\r\nhogs they are at least equal if not superior to carrots. As food for\r\nmankind they are considered extremely nutritive; and may, with great\r\nadvantage, be kept on board ships that are destined for long voyages. It\r\nis, however, said that they should not be dug up for use in the spring,\r\nbecause, at that season, the nutritive juices rising upward to produce the\r\nseed, they are then unwholesome.\r\n\r\nParsnips abound in saccharine juice; and various experiments have, in vain,\r\nbeen made with a view to extract sugar from them. In several parts of\r\nIreland they are used instead of malt in brewing; and, when properly\r\nfermented, they afford an agreeable beverage. The _seeds_ are considered by\r\nsome practitioners as an efficacious remedy in intermittent fevers.\r\n\r\n  90. _FENNEL_ (Anethum foeniculum) _is a well known plant, which is\r\n  cultivated in gardens, and grows wild in several parts of England._\r\n\r\nThe _leaves_ of fennel, both boiled and raw, are used in sauce for several\r\nkinds of fish. The tender buds are eaten in salads; and, in Italy, the\r\n_stalks_ are sometimes blanched as winter salad. A distilled water,\r\nprepared from the seeds, is occasionally administered as a medicine; and\r\nthere was formerly a notion that the _roots_ were peculiarly valuable, as a\r\nremedy in several diseases, but they are now almost wholly disregarded.\r\n\r\n  91. _CARAWAY is a small well known seed, produced by an umbelliferous\r\n  plant_ (Carum carui), _with smooth and double winged leaves, narrow\r\n  leaflets, and small white, or pale flesh-coloured flowers, of which the\r\n  petals are bent inward, so as to become heart-shaped._\r\n\r\nThe _seeds_ of caraway have a pleasant spicy smell, and a warm aromatic\r\ntaste. They are much used by pastry-cooks and confectioners in cakes, and\r\nfor other purposes. Incrusted with sugar, they are called caraway comfits.\r\nThey are also distilled with spirituous liquors, to improve their flavour;\r\nand are recommended as a medicine in several disorders. An essential _oil_\r\nand a _spirit_ are also prepared from them. In the spring of the year the\r\n_leaves_ are sometimes used in soups, or boiled with pot-herbs. The _roots_\r\nmay be converted into an agreeable pickle; and, if simply boiled, they are\r\nsaid by Parkinson to be better than parsnips.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows wild in several parts of England, but particularly in\r\nmeadows and pastures near Bury St. Edmunds, in Suffolk. It is much\r\ncultivated in Essex and Kent, sometimes alone, and sometimes mixed with\r\nteasel (53) and coriander (88). The season for cutting it is about the\r\nbeginning of July; and it is threshed in the field on a cloth, in the same\r\nmanner as rape-seed (187).\r\n\r\n  92. _ANISE-SEEDS are the production of an umbelliferous annual plant_\r\n  (Pimpinella anisum), _which grows wild in Egypt, Syria, and other Eastern\r\n  countries. They are roundish and striated, flatted on one side, and\r\n  pointed at one end; and of pale colour, inclining to green._\r\n\r\nAttempts were made more than two hundred years ago to cultivate anise in\r\nthis country, but the summers of our climate are seldom warm enough to\r\nbring the plant to perfection. It has consequently been found necessary to\r\nimport the seed from Malta and Spain, where it is cultivated to\r\nconsiderable extent.\r\n\r\nAnise-seeds have an aromatic smell, and a pleasant warm taste, accompanied\r\nwith some degree of sweetness. They have long been employed in medicine,\r\nand have been considered useful in diseases of the lungs and complaints of\r\nthe stomach. They give out all their virtue to rectified spirit; and a\r\nspirituous water prepared from a mixture of equal parts of anise-seed and\r\nangelica, is kept in the shops as a cordial.\r\n\r\n  93. _PARSLEY_ (Apium petroselinum) _is an annual umbelliferous plant too\r\n  common to need any description._\r\n\r\nThe uses of parsley, in our kitchens, both for sauce and garnish, are\r\nnumerous and well known. It is, however, poisonous to several kinds of\r\nbirds; and, although so commonly used at table, facts have been adduced\r\nfrom which it would appear that, with some persons, it occasions epilepsy,\r\nor at least aggravates the fits in those who are subject to that disease.\r\nInflammation in the eyes has also been attributed to the use of it. Parsley\r\nis eaten with great avidity by sheep, and has been recommended for use in\r\nseveral diseases of those animals, as well as in some diseases of horses.\r\nBoth the _roots_ and _seed_ are employed in medicine. The former have a\r\nsweetish taste, accompanied with a slight warmth, and a flavour somewhat\r\nresembling that of the carrot: the latter are warm and aromatic.\r\n\r\nParsley is a native of Sardinia, and propagated by seed, which is usually\r\nsown about the month of March.\r\n\r\n  94. _CELERY_ (Apium graveolens) _is a well known plant belonging to the\r\n  same tribe as parsley._\r\n\r\nIn a wild state celery is found in ditches and marshes of several parts of\r\nEngland, and is a small, acrid, and noxious plant, called _smallage_: but,\r\nwhen cultivated, it entirely loses these properties.\r\n\r\nIt is grown in trenches, and is earthed up for the purpose of blanching or\r\nwhitening the lower parts. The seeds are sown in spring, and the plants may\r\nbe taken out for use towards the end of the autumn. Celery is eaten raw in\r\nsalads, boiled in soup, or stewed. The seeds are used, particularly at sea,\r\nfor the flavouring of soup, to which they give the same taste as the plant\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n  95. _COPAL is a somewhat resinous substance, obtained from a tree_ (Rhus\r\n  copallinum) _the produce of America, which has winged and very entire\r\n  leaves, the foot-stalks membranaceous and jointed._\r\n\r\nWe annually import considerable quantities of copal from the Spanish\r\ncolonies in America, in irregular masses, some of which are transparent, of\r\nyellowish or brown colour, and others are whitish and semi-transparent.\r\nWhen copal is dissolved in any volatile liquid, and thinly spread upon\r\nwood, metal, or any other firm substance, so that the liquid may evaporate,\r\nthe copal remains perfectly transparent; and forms one of the most\r\nbeautiful and perfect varnishes that can be imagined. The varnish thus\r\nformed has the name of _copal varnish_, and is said to have been first\r\ndiscovered in France. One mode of preparing it is by melting the copal with\r\nan equal quantity of linseed oil (97); another, by mixture with oil of\r\nturpentine; and a third, by mixture with alcohol or spirit of wine. The\r\nparticular processes are described in the fourth volume of Dr. Thomson's\r\nSystem of Chemistry, fifth edition; but they are too long and intricate for\r\ninsertion here.\r\n\r\nCopal is the varnish which is chiefly used in the japanning of snuff-boxes,\r\ntea-boards, and other similar articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  96. _The COMMON ELDER_ (Sambucus nigra) _is a wild English shrub,\r\n  distinguishable by its winged leaves, with serrated and somewhat oval\r\n  leaflets, its clusters of small white flowers divided into five principal\r\n  branches, and the small black or purple berries by which these are\r\n  succeeded._\r\n\r\nThe uses of the elder are more numerous than those of most other shrubs.\r\nThere is scarcely any part of this shrub which has not been advantageously\r\nemployed in some way or other. The _wood_ is yellow, and, in old trees,\r\nbecomes so hard that it will take a polish almost as bright as that of box\r\n(232); and, indeed, it is often used as a substitute for box-wood. Its\r\ntoughness also is such that it is made into skewers for butchers, tops for\r\nfishing rods, and needles for the weaving of nets. It is likewise employed\r\nby turners.\r\n\r\nSir J. E. Smith has remarked that this tree is, as it were, a whole\r\nmagazine of physic to rustic practitioners, and that it is not quite\r\nneglected even by professional men. Ointments have been made of the green\r\n_inner bark_, and of the _leaves_. The dried _flowers_, infused in water,\r\nare used in fomentations, or as tea: and, mixed with butter-milk, they are\r\nsometimes employed as a wash for the face; and the clusters of flowers,\r\nbefore they open, may be made into a delicious pickle, to eat with boiled\r\nmutton. The _berries_ are boiled into a rob, which is useful in sore\r\nthroats, colds, and hoarsenesses. In addition to their medicinal services,\r\nthe leaves are sometimes thrown into the subterraneous paths of moles,\r\nunder an impression that their smell will drive away those noxious animals.\r\nIf turnips, cabbages, fruit trees, or corn, all of which are subject to\r\nblight from various kinds of insects, be strongly whipped with the green\r\nleaves and branches of elder, insects will not attack them; and an infusion\r\nof the leaves is sometimes sprinkled by gardeners over the buds of such\r\nflowers as they wish to preserve from the devastation of caterpillars.\r\nElder flowers have an agreeable flavour, which they impart, in\r\ndistillation, to water: they are likewise used to give a flavour to\r\nvinegar. The berries are poisonous to poultry, but their juice, properly\r\nfermented, makes a pleasant and wholesome wine; and, in Germany, a very\r\npure and strong spirit is distilled from them. The juice of elder berries\r\nis sometimes employed to give a red colour to raisin or other sweet wine.\r\nThe _young shoots_ of this shrub are filled with an exceedingly light\r\n_pith_, which is cut into balls for electrical experiments; and is also\r\nmade into toys for the amusement of children.\r\n\r\nThe elder will grow and thrive in almost any soil and situation; but, as\r\nevery part of this shrub has an unpleasant narcotic smell, people ought to\r\nbe cautious not to sleep under its shade, as, in such case, it might prove\r\nof serious injury to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTETRAGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  97. _FLAX is the produce of an annual plant_ (Linum usitatissimum, Fig.\r\n  37), _with spear-shaped leaves, and blue flowers, which is cultivated in\r\n  several parts of Great Britain, and grows wild in corn-fields and sandy\r\n  pastures of some of the southern counties._\r\n\r\n  _The stems of these plants rise to the height of about two feet. The seed\r\n  vessels and leaves of the calyx are sharp pointed, and the flowers have\r\n  each five scolloped petals._\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that we were originally indebted for this plant to those\r\nparts of Egypt which are annually inundated by the Nile; but the time of\r\nits introduction into this country is unknown. Its utility is incalculable.\r\nTo it we are indebted for the linen we wear, for our sheets, table-cloths,\r\nand numerous other indispensable articles of clothing and domestic economy;\r\nand although cotton might, in some degree, supply its place, those persons\r\nwho have been accustomed to the comforts of linen would be little desirous\r\nof the exchange.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of flax is pursued to considerable extent in some parts of\r\nthe British dominions. The seed imported from Riga and Holland is\r\ngenerally, though perhaps erroneously, esteemed the best. It is sown in\r\nMarch or April; and the plants, when nearly ripe, are pulled up by the\r\nroots. These, if flax and not seed be the object of the crop, are either\r\nplaced in small parcels upon the surface of the land, for exposure to the\r\nsun, to dry; or they are immediately conveyed to the place where they are\r\nto undergo the process called watering. For this purpose they are loosely\r\ntied in small bundles, placed in pools or ponds of soft and stagnant water,\r\nand allowed to continue there several days. By the fermentation which takes\r\nplace, the bark or flaxy substance becomes separated. They are then taken\r\nout, and thinly spread upon the grass, in regular rows. Here they are\r\noccasionally turned until they have become so brittle, that, on being\r\nrubbed between the hands, the flax easily and freely separates from the\r\nstalks. They are taken up, and bound in sheaves, to be either sent to a\r\nmill, or to be broken and scuttled, as it is called, by a machine contrived\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe flax, by the above process, having been separated from the stalks, it\r\nsubsequently undergoes various dressings, according to the purposes for\r\nwhich it is to be used.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants have been grown for _seed_, they are pulled as before, and\r\nthen laid together by handfuls upon the ground, with the seed ends towards\r\nthe south, that they may be the better exposed to the sun. The next\r\noperation is to force off the seed vessels. For this purpose a large cloth\r\nis usually spread on some adjacent and convenient spot of ground, and an\r\ninstrument, called a ripple, is placed in the middle of it. This is a sort\r\nof comb, consisting of six, eight, or ten, long, triangular, upright teeth.\r\nThe seed ends of the flax are pulled repeatedly through the teeth of the\r\ncomb, by which the parts containing the seed are removed from the stalks.\r\nAfter this the pods and seeds, which have the name of _line-seeds_, are\r\nspread upon a cloth in the sun to dry, and subsequently are threshed,\r\nsifted, winnowed, and cleansed. The best seed is generally preserved for\r\nsowing, and the second sort yields considerable profit in the oil which is\r\nobtained from it by pressure. This, which is called _linseed oil_, is\r\nequally useful in the arts and in medicine. It is occasionally employed for\r\nmaking the soap called green soap. If heat be applied during the pressure\r\nof the seeds, the oil attains a yellowish colour and a peculiar smell, and,\r\nin this state, it is used by painters and varnishers. An infusion of the\r\nseed, in the manner of tea, is recommended in coughs; and from the seed is\r\nalso made an useful kind of poultice for external inflammations.\r\n\r\nAfter the oil has been expressed, the remaining farinaceous part of the\r\nseeds is squeezed together into large masses, called _oil-cake_ which is\r\ngiven as food to oxen.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked that the water in which flax has been macerated becomes\r\nthereby poisonous to cattle; and, on this account, the practice of steeping\r\nit in any running stream or common pond was prohibited by an act of\r\nParliament, passed in the reign of Henry the Eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS VI.--HEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  98. _The PINE_ (Bromelia ananas) _is a rich and highly fragrant fruit, of\r\n  large size, and yellow colour, with protuberances on its surface; and\r\n  crowned by a tuft of strong and pointed leaves, edged with sharp spines._\r\n\r\nThis, the best and finest flavoured of all known fruits, was originally\r\nimported into England from South America, about the year 1690. In that\r\ncountry and the West Indies it has long been cultivated in the open ground;\r\nand, from free access to a congenial atmosphere, it attains there a much\r\nfiner flavour than is possible in a forced state, in the hot-houses of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nPines are planted in earth; and the pots which contain them are immersed in\r\nbeds of bark, after it has been used by the tanners. About the month of\r\nApril the young fruit begins to advance, but the usual season for ripening\r\ndoes not commence till July, and the fruit is in greatest perfection from\r\nthe middle of August to the end of September. The ripening of pines is\r\ndiscoverable by the fragrant odour which they emit, and by their\r\nprotuberances yielding to pressure with the hand; and their flavour\r\nspeedily dissipates if left uncut longer than three or four days after they\r\nare fully ripe. When brought to table, their leafy crowns should be\r\nreserved for planting. These, if placed in pots, and plunged in the\r\nbark-bed, or in a hot-bed, and covered, for some time, with glass, will in\r\ntwo years bear fruit.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of pine, of which the following are among the\r\nprincipal.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _White Pine._--This has a whitish and fibrous flesh, and the rind as\r\nyellow as that of an orange. Its smell is highly fragrant, and it excels\r\nmost other kinds in size and beauty, although its flavour is inferior to\r\nthat of many. Its juice edges the teeth, and sometimes makes the lips\r\nsmart.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The yellow pine_ edges the teeth less; but both this and the\r\npreceding variety are exceeded by\r\n\r\n(_c_)  _The sugar-loaf pine_; which is distinguished by the purple stripes\r\non the outside of the leaves, and by its straw-coloured fruit.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Montserrat pine_ is now rare in Europe, though in America it is\r\nesteemed in preference to most others. It is principally known by the\r\nprotuberances of the fruit being longer and flatter than those of the\r\ncommon sort.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies an excellent liquid sweetmeat or confection is made from\r\npines. This fruit also is sometimes preserved whole, and, when taken out of\r\nthe syrup, is iced over with sugar. Sweetmeats of this kind were formerly\r\nsent into Europe, in great quantity, from the Antilles. Wine made from\r\npines is almost equal to Malmsey: at the end of about three weeks it\r\nbecomes somewhat acid, but it recovers by longer keeping. Pines, in the\r\nWest Indies, are frequently put into rum to communicate to that liquor\r\ntheir peculiar aromatic flavour.\r\n\r\n  99. _GARLIC_ (Allium sativum) _is a plant with bulbous root, of irregular\r\n  form, composed of many smaller bulbs, called cloves, which are all\r\n  included within a white skin._\r\n\r\n  _The stem leaves are flat and narrow; the upper part of the stem bears\r\n  small bulbs, and the stamens are three pointed._\r\n\r\nIn warm climates, where _garlic_ is produced having considerably less\r\nacrimony than in this country, it is much used, both as a seasoning and as\r\nfood. The lower classes of French, Spaniards, and Portuguese, consume great\r\nquantities of it. The Jews also eat of it to excess. With us it is in\r\nconsiderable estimation for culinary and other domestic purposes. It has an\r\nacrid taste, and an highly offensive smell; and it differs from the onion\r\nonly by being more powerful in its effects. When bruised and applied to the\r\nskin, it causes inflammation, and raises blisters.\r\n\r\nThe medical properties of garlic are various. In dropsical complaints,\r\nasthmas, and agues, it is said to have been successfully used. Some\r\ninstances have occurred, in deafness, of the beneficial effects of wrapping\r\na clove of garlic in muslin and putting it into the ear. As a medicine\r\ninternally taken, garlic is administered as a bolus, or made into pills.\r\nIts smell is considered an infallible remedy against vapours, and to be\r\nuseful in nearly all the nervous disorders to which females are subject. An\r\noil is sometimes prepared from garlic, which is so heavy as to sink in\r\nwater. But the virtues of this pungent vegetable are more perfectly and\r\nmore readily extracted by spirit of wine than in any other way. A syrup is\r\nalso made from it.\r\n\r\nThe juice of garlic is said to be the best and strongest cement that can be\r\nadopted for broken glass and china, leaving little or no mark, if used with\r\ncare. Snails, worms, and the grubs, or larvæ of insects, as well as moles,\r\nand other vermin, may all be driven away by placing preparations of garlic\r\nin or near their haunts.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows wild in the island of Sicily.\r\n\r\n  100. _LEEKS_ (Allium porrum) _belong to the onion or garlic tribe, and\r\n  are known by their leaves growing out on each side, somewhat in the shape\r\n  of a fan._\r\n\r\nIn some countries leeks are much esteemed for culinary uses, in soups,\r\nbroth, and for boiling as greens with meat.\r\n\r\nThey are considered the badge of the Welsh nation, and representations of\r\nthem are frequently worn by persons of that country on the day of their\r\npatron saint, St. David. The origin of this custom was an occurrence,\r\nduring the Welsh wars, in which a party of Welshmen, wanting a mark of\r\ndistinction, and shortly afterwards passing through a field or garden of\r\nleeks, seized and stuck the plants in their caps, and under this signal\r\nwere victorious.\r\n\r\nLeeks are natives of Switzerland.\r\n\r\n  101. _SHALOT_ (Allium ascalonicum) _is a kind of garlic, the bulbs or\r\n  roots of which are oblong, irregular, and seldom of large size._\r\n\r\n  _The stem is naked and round; the leaves are somewhat awl-shaped; the\r\n  head of flowers is globular; and the stamens are three-pointed._\r\n\r\nThe uses of shalot, or echalotte, as it is denominated by the French, are\r\nalmost wholly confined to cookery. It has a strong, but rather pleasant\r\nsmell, on which account it is generally preferred to onions. It is employed\r\nfor the seasoning of soups, gravy, hashes, pickles, and for numerous other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows wild in several parts of the Continent.\r\n\r\n  102. _The CANADIAN or TREE ONION_ (Allium Canadense) _is remarkable for\r\n  producing a bulb or onion at the top of the stalk._\r\n\r\n  _The stem is naked and round; and the leaves are flat and narrow._\r\n\r\nThese onions are well deserving of attention both as objects of curiosity,\r\nfrom producing their bulb at the upper extremity of the stalk, and also for\r\ntheir use. When pickled, they are generally thought superior in flavour to\r\nthe common onion.\r\n\r\nThey were originally imported from Canada; are perennial, and are\r\npropagated by planting the bulbs in the spring or autumn. Either the bulbs\r\nof the root or those on the stalk will grow.\r\n\r\n  103. _CHIVES_ (Allium schoenoprasum) _are the smallest of the garlic\r\n  tribe, seldom rising more than a few inches above the ground, and the\r\n  bulbs not being larger than peas._\r\n\r\n  _The stem is naked, as long as the leaves; and the leaves are round and\r\n  somewhat awl-shaped._\r\n\r\nChives are natives of Italy, Switzerland, and several other parts of\r\nEurope; and are so hardy, and at the same time so useful, that they merit a\r\nplace in every garden: yet, in the northern counties of England and in\r\nScotland, they are very rarely to be seen. The leaves, which are small and\r\nare the principal parts that are used, appear early in the spring. They are\r\nemployed in salads, and for numerous culinary purposes; and often at a\r\nseason when other plants of the same tribe cannot be procured.\r\n\r\n  104. _The COMMON ONION_ (Allium cepa) _is known by its round and hollow\r\n  leaves, and its swelling pipy stalk, which is considerably thicker in the\r\n  middle than either at the top or bottom._\r\n\r\nThe name of onion is derived from the Latin word _unio_, which, properly,\r\nsignifies a bulb that does not throw out offsets. Onions are propagated by\r\nseed which are sown in spring; and the bulbs or roots arrive at perfection\r\nin the autumn. The whole plant, when young, is eaten as salad. Onions\r\ngenerally cease to grow towards the middle of August, the stalks and leaves\r\nat that time shrinking and turning brown. Shortly after this they must be\r\ndrawn out of the earth; the tops and blades must be cut off; and the roots\r\ndried, either in a warm place, or by exposure to the sun.\r\n\r\n_Spanish onions_ are of large size, and flattened shape; and _Portugal\r\nonions_ are large, handsome bulbs, of roundish form.\r\n\r\nBy the common people onions are frequently eaten raw with their food. This\r\nhas particularly been the case, and from time immemorial, with the\r\ninhabitants of Egypt. By stimulating the stomach, they are supposed to\r\nfavour digestion. Some persons have imagined that they possess a large\r\nportion of alimentary matter; but others say that they afford little or no\r\nnourishment, and that, when eaten freely, they produce flatulencies,\r\noccasion thirst, head-achs, and turbulent dreams. Onions have so much\r\nacrimony as generally to affect the breath for many hours: but when boiled\r\nor roasted, this is, in a great measure, dissipated, and they then exhibit\r\nsome sweetness, with a considerable portion of mucilaginous matter. Onions\r\nare of great use in several culinary preparations, but particularly in soup\r\nand pickles. They are employed in medicine chiefly as poultices for\r\nswellings; and have been recommended by some persons, to be rubbed on bald\r\nparts of the head, to promote the growth of the hair.\r\n\r\n  105. _ASPARAGUS_ (Asparagus officinalis), _is a well known plant, the\r\n  young shoots of which are a favourite culinary vegetable_.\r\n\r\nFew circumstances in the phenomena of vegetation are more remarkable than\r\nthe gradual enlargement of size, and improvement of quality, which have\r\ntaken place in the cultivation of asparagus. It grows wild on the pebbly\r\nbeach near Weymouth, and in the island of Anglesea: but its stem, in these\r\nsituations, is not usually thicker than a goose's quill, and its whole\r\nheight does not exceed a few inches; whereas in gardens its stem is\r\nsometimes near three quarters of an inch thick, and its height, when at\r\nmaturity, is four or five feet.\r\n\r\nAsparagus is one of the greatest delicacies which our kitchen gardens\r\nafford, and it is particularly estimable from the early season at which it\r\nis produced. Even in the open ground, it is in perfection for the table\r\nabout the end of April; and when forced, by being planted in hot-beds under\r\nglass, it may be cut much earlier. Asparagus continues in season till about\r\nthe end of June.\r\n\r\nIt is usually raised from seed, in beds formed for the purpose: and the\r\nplants should remain three years in the ground before they are cut: after\r\nwhich, for several years, they will continue to afford a regular annual\r\nsupply. During the winter, they are secured from the effects of frost by\r\nthe beds being covered some inches thick with straw or litter.\r\n\r\nIn the cutting of asparagus, the knife is passed three or four inches\r\nbeneath the ground. The plants are cut by sloping the blade upward; and the\r\nwhite part that we see, is that which had not previously been exposed to\r\nthe air. The smallest plants are suffered to grow for the purpose of\r\nproducing berries to re-stock the beds, and keep them continually in a\r\nstate of supply.\r\n\r\n  106. _ALOES are an extensive tribe of plants, some of which are not more\r\n  than a few inches, whilst others are thirty feet and upwards, in height.\r\n  All the leaves are fleshy, thick, and more or less spinous at the edges\r\n  or extremity._\r\n\r\n  _These plants, which are chiefly inhabitants of hot climates, have\r\n  flowers of a single petal, the mouth expanded, the base nectariferous,\r\n  and the filaments of the stamens inserted into the receptacle._\r\n\r\nSome of the larger kinds of aloes are of great importance to the\r\ninhabitants of countries in which they grow. Beset as the _leaves_ are with\r\nstrong spines, they form an impenetrable fence. The negroes of the western\r\ncoast of Africa make ropes and weave nets of the fibrous part of these\r\nleaves. The Hottentots hollow out the _stems_ of one of the kinds into\r\nquivers for their arrows. In Jamaica, there is a species of aloe which\r\nsupplies the inhabitants with bow-strings, fishing lines, and materials\r\nfrom which they are able to weave stockings and hammocks. An aloe which\r\ngrows in the kingdom of Mexico is applied by the inhabitants to almost\r\nevery purpose of life. It serves as hedges for enclosures: its trunk\r\nsupplies the place of timber for the roofs of houses, and its leaves the\r\nplace of tiles. From this plant the Mexicans make thread, needles, and\r\nvarious articles of clothing and cordage: whilst from its juices they\r\nmanufacture wine, sugar, and vinegar. Some parts of it they eat, and others\r\nthey apply in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe _juice_ of aloes was formerly used in Eastern countries in embalming,\r\nto preserve dead bodies from putrefaction; and, as the resinous part of\r\nthis juice is not soluble in water, it is sometimes adopted in hot climates\r\nas a preservative to ships' bottoms against the attack of marine worms. One\r\nounce of it mixed with turpentine, tallow, and white lead, is considered to\r\nbe sufficient for covering about two superficial feet of plank; and about\r\ntwelve pounds are sufficient for a vessel of fifty tons' burthen. In proof\r\nof the efficacy of this method, two planks of equal thickness, and cut from\r\nthe same tree, were placed under water, one of them in its natural state,\r\nand the other smeared with the composition above described. They were\r\nsuffered to continue in the water eight months, and when, at the end of\r\nthat time, they were taken out, the former was perforated in every part,\r\nand in a state of absolute decay; whilst the latter was as perfect as at\r\nfirst. In the East Indies, the juice of these plants is used as a varnish,\r\nto preserve wood from the attacks of destructive insects: and skins, and\r\neven living animals, are sometimes smeared with it for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is a tract of mountains, about fifty miles north of the Cape of Good\r\nHope, which is wholly covered with aloes. Among the Mahometans, and\r\nparticularly in Egypt, the aloe is a kind of symbolic plant: it is\r\ndedicated to the offices of religion; and pilgrims, on their return from\r\nMecca, suspend it over their doors, as a declaration that they have\r\nperformed that holy journey.\r\n\r\n  107. _SOCOTRINE ALOES are the dried juice of a large species of aloe_\r\n  (Aloe perfoliata, Fig. 38) _which grows in great abundance in the island\r\n  of Socotra, near the mouth of the Red Sea._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves are sword-shaped, fleshy, smooth, full of juice, of\r\n  bluish-green colour; and beset at the edges with strong spines. The\r\n  flower-stems rise to the height of three or four feet, are smooth, erect,\r\n  and have at the top a spike of flowers of purple or reddish colour, the\r\n  stamens of which have oblong orange-coloured anthers._\r\n\r\nThe true Socotrine aloes are imported into this country wrapped in skins;\r\nand when pure have a bright surface, and are in some degree pellucid. In\r\nthe lump they have a yellowish red colour, with a purplish cast; and, when\r\nreduced to powder, are of a golden yellow. Their taste is bitter and\r\ndisagreeable, but somewhat aromatic; and their smell is not unpleasant.\r\n\r\n_Barbadoes aloes_, _common aloes_, or _hepatic aloes_, are the dried juice\r\nof a variety of the Socotrine aloes, which is cultivated in Barbadoes and\r\nJamaica. Of this we import three kinds: one in gourd shells; an inferior\r\nkind, in pots; and another, still worse, in casks.\r\n\r\nIn the cultivation of aloes it is requisite that the plants should grow for\r\ntwo or three years before the juice is procured from them. The operation of\r\ncollecting the juice is performed in different ways. Dr. Browne tells us\r\nthat labourers go into the field with knives and tubs; and that cutting off\r\nthe largest and most succulent leaves close to the stalk, they immediately\r\nput them into the tubs in an upright position, that the liquor may drain\r\nfrom the wounds. When this is nearly all discharged, they take the leaves\r\nout singly, and clear them of any juice that may adhere to them; and the\r\nliquor is then put into shallow flat-bottomed vessels, and dried gradually\r\nin the sun, until it acquires a proper thickness to be poured out or ladled\r\ninto the gourd shells which are to contain it. What is thus obtained is\r\ncalled _Socotrine aloes_, and is the clearest and most valuable of any. An\r\nadditional quantity of juice is obtained by pressing the leaves.\r\n\r\nIn some places the plants are pulled up by the roots, and, after having\r\nbeen carefully cleansed from earth or other impurities, they are sliced and\r\ncut in pieces, into small hand-baskets or nets. In these the pieces are\r\nboiled, for a little while, in water, by which the juice is extracted; and\r\nsuccessive basketfuls are boiled in the same liquor, until it becomes thick\r\nand of dark colour. The fluid part is subsequently evaporated, and what\r\nremains is put into gourd shells for sale.\r\n\r\nOther methods of inspissating or drying the juice are to pour it into\r\nbladders left open at the top, and suspended in the sun; or to place it in\r\nbroad shallow trays of wood, pewter or tin, exposed to the sun every dry\r\nday, until the fluid parts are exhaled, and a perfect resin is formed,\r\nwhich is then packed up for sale.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind called _Caballine_ or _horse aloes_, which has a rank and\r\nunpleasant smell, but in taste is not much more disagreeable than either of\r\nthe others. In its properties it agrees nearly with hepatic aloes, but it\r\nis chiefly employed by farriers in horse medicines.\r\n\r\nThe medical properties of aloes have long been known and established: and\r\ntheir extensive application in medicine is, perhaps, the best proof that\r\ncan be adduced of their utility. In the arts aloes are, in several\r\nrespects, useful. But, particularly, the leaves of the Socotrine aloes\r\nafford a beautiful violet colour which does not require the aid of any\r\nmordant to fix it; the same also is capable of being formed into a fine\r\ntransparent colour for painting in miniature.\r\n\r\n  108. _The GREAT, or AMERICAN ALOE_ (Agave Americana), _is a large plant,\r\n  the leaves of which are thick, fleshy, and spinous at the edge, and the\r\n  stem branched and of great height._\r\n\r\n  _The flowers of this plant are distinguished by having the tube of the\r\n  corolla narrowed in the middle, the stamens longer than the corolla, and\r\n  the style longer than the stamens._\r\n\r\nThis magnificent native of North America is by no means an uncommon plant\r\nin our gardens, but, with us, it is seldom seen in flower. There is indeed\r\na notion, but it is an erroneous one, that the American aloe does not bloom\r\nuntil it is a hundred years old. The fact is, that the flowering depends\r\nalmost wholly on its growth. In hot countries it will flower in a few\r\nyears; but in colder climates, the growth being slower, it is necessarily\r\nlonger in arriving at maturity. The stem which bears the blossoms rises\r\nfrom the centre of the leaves, and, when the plant is in a vigorous state,\r\nit frequently exceeds the height of twenty feet. An American aloe in the\r\ngarden of the king of Prussia was forty feet high. Branches issue from\r\nevery side, and in such manner as to form a kind of pyramid, composed of\r\ngreenish yellow flowers, which stand erect, and are seen in thick clusters\r\nat every joint. When in full flower, the appearance of this aloe is\r\nextremely splendid; and if the season be favourable, and the plant be\r\nsheltered from the cold in autumn, a succession of blossoms will sometimes\r\nbe produced for near three months.\r\n\r\nIn the warmer parts of Europe, American aloes are cultivated as objects of\r\nconsiderable utility. They are frequently grown in rows, as fences, for\r\nenclosures, particularly in Spain, Portugal, and Italy. In Algarvia the\r\nleaves are employed for scouring pewter and other kitchen utensils, and\r\nfloors; and, cut into slices, are used for the feeding of cattle.\r\n\r\nBy a certain preparation, the juice of the leaves is made into cakes, which\r\nare employed for washing, and which will lather with salt water as well as\r\nwith fresh. The fibres of the leaves, when properly prepared, may be\r\nseparated into threads that are useful in various ways. This separation is\r\nsometimes effected by bruising and steeping them in water, and afterwards\r\nbeating them. The process, in some parts of Portugal, is, after plucking\r\nthe largest and best leaves, to place them on a square board, which a\r\nperson presses obliquely between his breast and the ground, and then\r\nscrapes with a square iron bar held in both hands. By this operation all\r\nthe juices are pressed out, and only the fibres and some of the membranous\r\nparts of the leaves remain, which are then easily detached. The fibres are\r\nemployed for all the purposes to which thread can be applied, but they are\r\nneither strong nor durable; and if exposed to moisture, they soon decay.\r\n\r\n  109. _The FAN PALM is a very remarkable tree_ (Corypha umbraculifera)\r\n  _that grows in the East Indies, but particularly in Malabar, and the\r\n  island of Ceylon; its leaves, eight or ten in number, rise out of the\r\n  summit of the trunk, are winged and somewhat fan-shaped, and have their\r\n  segments connected by a thread or fibre._\r\n\r\nThe stem of the fan palm is straight, cylindrical, smooth, and as tall as a\r\nship's mast. Its _leaves_ are upwards of six yards in length, and four\r\nyards wide; and form altogether a head of twelve or thirteen yards in\r\ndiameter. These leaves, which, when dry, fold up somewhat like a fan, are\r\nused for the covering of huts and cottages; and not unfrequently by\r\nsoldiers, instead of canvas, for the construction of tents. One of them is\r\nsufficiently large to shelter twenty persons from the rays of the sun. They\r\nare also a kind of natural paper on which the inhabitants write, by means\r\nof a sharp-pointed iron instrument, which leaves indelible marks upon them.\r\nMany of the books which are shown in Europe for those of Egyptian papyrus\r\n(26) are said to be formed of parts of these leaves.--The _pith_ of the\r\ntrunk, beaten into a kind of paste and mixed with water, is formed into\r\ncakes, and constitutes a species of bread, very serviceable to the\r\ninhabitants in times of scarcity. The _juice_ of some parts of the tree is\r\nused as an emetic.\r\n\r\nThe fan palms are said not to bear fruit until they are near forty years\r\nold; but after this period, when in perfection, they produce annually more\r\nthan twenty thousand _berries_ each. These are each about 1½ inch diameter,\r\nof globular shape, smooth, green, and fleshy; but are not known to be of\r\nany use.\r\n\r\n  110. _The ROTANG or DRAGON'S BLOOD TREE, is a species of cane_ (Calamus\r\n  rotang) _which grows to the length of more than a hundred feet, is about\r\n  as thick as a man's arm, and is closely beset with erect prickles._\r\n\r\n  _This cane has at the top a tuft of leaves which are several feet in\r\n  length, and alternately winged, and of which the leaflets are\r\n  sword-shaped, and armed with sharp spines._\r\n\r\nIn consequence of its great length and slender form, the rotang tree (which\r\nis usually found in woods near rivers, and in morassy places) does not grow\r\nentirely upright; but, after having attained the height of five or six\r\nyards, it depends, for support, upon other trees, which it sometimes\r\noverruns, in nearly an horizontal direction to the extent of sixty or\r\neighty feet. The flowers are produced in upright spikes that separate into\r\nlong spreading branches, and are succeeded by a red and somewhat egg-shaped\r\nfruit, which to the taste is pleasantly acid.\r\n\r\nThe drug called _Dragon's Blood_[4] is obtained from this fruit, in Japan,\r\nand several other countries of the East. The Japanese expose the fruit of\r\nthe Rotang tree to the steam of boiling water, by which the external shell\r\nis softened, and a resinous fluid is forced out, that is afterwards\r\nenclosed in leaves and suspended in the air to dry. In Sumatra the external\r\nsurface of the fruit is observed to be covered with the resin: this is\r\nrubbed off, melted in the sun, and formed into grains or globules, which\r\nare folded in leaves, and are considered the purest kind of dragon's blood.\r\nIn some countries the fruit is boiled in water, and the resin, which floats\r\nupon the surface, is skimmed off and subsequently purified, and formed into\r\nthe requisite shape for sale. An inferior kind of dragon's blood is made up\r\ninto large masses, which contain the membranous parts of the fruit and\r\nother impurities. When this substance is tolerably pure, it breaks smooth,\r\nand appears internally of a dark red colour; melts readily, and easily\r\ncatches fire. Its principal use is in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe _stem_ of the rotang furnishes the inhabitants of the countries where\r\nit grows with shafts for pikes or spears; and the inner part of the young\r\nshoots is boiled or roasted for food.\r\n\r\n  111. _The COMMON WALKING CANES_ (Calamus scipionum) _have a smooth and\r\n  glossy stem, usually marked with dark spots: and the knots or joints are\r\n  sometimes three or four feet asunder._\r\n\r\nThese canes grow, very abundantly, in Sumatra and other Eastern islands, as\r\nwell as on the continent of India, whence they appear to have been\r\noriginally exported to Europe by the Dutch. There is a considerable trade\r\nin them to China. The long spaces between the knots, their shining surface,\r\nand lightness, have rendered them preferable to most other articles for\r\nwalking canes.\r\n\r\n  112. _The RATTAN or TRUE CANE_ (Calamus verus), _is remarkable for\r\n  growing to the great length of a hundred feet, and upwards, and, at the\r\n  same time, not being thicker than a man's finger._\r\n\r\nA trade in rattans to considerable extent is carried on from several of the\r\nislands of the east to China, which is the principal market for them. These\r\ncanes are extremely tough and flexible, of yellowish brown colour, and,\r\nwhen cut into thongs, are sometimes used to make cables and other ropes.\r\nOur cane-bottomed chairs are made of split rattans, the outer or smooth\r\nsurface of which is always kept uppermost. For this work the canes are\r\nchosen by their great length, pale yellow colour, and bright gloss. They\r\nare purchased in bundles, each of which contains a hundred canes, neatly\r\ntied in the middle, and the ends bent together. When perfectly dry, they\r\nare so hard as to yield sparks of fire when struck against each other. The\r\nword rattan, in the Malay language, signifies a staff or walking stick.\r\n\r\n  113. _The BAMBOO CANE_ (Bambusa arundinacea) _has a hollow, round,\r\n  straight, and shining stem; and sometimes grows to the length of forty\r\n  feet and upwards: it has knots at the distance of ten or twelve inches\r\n  from each other, with thick, rough, and hairy sheaths, alternate\r\n  branches, and small, entire, and spear-shaped leaves._\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any plant so common in hot climates as this, and few are\r\nmore extensively useful. It occurs within the tropical regions both of the\r\neastern and western hemispheres, throughout the East Indies and the greater\r\npart of China, in the West Indies, and America. In England, it can only be\r\ncultivated in a hot-house; and its growth is so rapid, even there, that a\r\nstrong shoot has been known to spring from the ground and attain the height\r\nof twenty feet in six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of many parts of India build their houses almost wholly of\r\nbamboo; and make nearly every description of furniture with it, in a very\r\ningenious manner. They likewise form with it several kinds of utensils, for\r\ntheir kitchens and tables; and, from two pieces of bamboo rubbed hard\r\ntogether, they produce fire. The masts of boats, boxes, baskets, and\r\ninnumerable other articles, are made of bamboo. After having been bruised,\r\nsteeped in water, and formed into a pulp, the _sheaths_ and _leaves_ may be\r\nmanufactured into paper. The stems are frequently bored, and used as pipes\r\nfor conveying water; and the strongest stems serve to make the poles with\r\nwhich the slaves or servants carry those kind of litters so common in the\r\nEast, called palanquins. The stems of the bamboo serve also as the usual\r\nfence for gardens and other enclosures: and the leaves are generally put\r\nround the tea which is sent in chests from China to Europe. The Chinese\r\nmake, of the external _bark_ of the bamboo, a kind of cordage, which has\r\nthe advantage of united lightness and durability. For this purpose the bark\r\nis cleft in strips several feet in length; and these are twisted together\r\naccording to the thickness that is required. For the tow lines of their\r\nvessels, eight or nine bands or strips are sufficient; but, for cables, a\r\nmuch greater number is requisite. Some of the Malays preserve the small and\r\n_tender shoots_ of bamboo in vinegar and pepper to be eaten with their\r\nfood. Many of the walking canes which we see in Europe are formed of the\r\nyoung shoots of this plant.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese make a kind of frame-work of bamboo, by which they are enabled\r\nto float in water; and the Chinese merchants, when going on a voyage,\r\nalways provide themselves with this simple apparatus to save their lives in\r\ncase of shipwreck. It is formed by placing four bamboos horizontally across\r\neach other, so as to leave, in the middle, a square place for the body;\r\nand, when used, this frame is slipped over the head, and secured by being\r\ntied to the waist.\r\n\r\n  114. _The COMMON RUSH_ (Juncus effusus) _is known by its green, smooth,\r\n  stiff, upright, leafless and pointed stem; having a loose bunch of small\r\n  flowers at the side, and the seed-vessels blunt at the extremity._\r\n\r\nAlthough the rush is generally considered by farmers a noxious weed in wet\r\nmeadows and pastures, it is applicable to a variety of useful purposes; but\r\nparticularly for making the wicks of rushlights. For this purpose it is\r\nusually cut a little after Midsummer; and is immediately afterwards thrown\r\ninto water, and kept there, that it may not become dry, and that it may be\r\nthe more easily peeled.\r\n\r\nAt first a person would find it no easy matter to divest a rush of its\r\nrind, so as to leave on each side, from top to bottom, one regular, narrow,\r\nand even rib, that may support the pith. But this, by practice, soon\r\nbecomes familiar even to children.\r\n\r\nWhen rushes are thus far prepared, they are spread on the grass to be\r\nbleached; and, afterwards, they are dried in the sun for use.\r\n\r\nIf only one rib of peel be left, instead of two, rushes will supply the\r\nplace of cotton wicks for candles. In some parts of Hampshire the labouring\r\npeople form wicks of this description; they dip them into scalding fat or\r\ngrease, and use them in place of candles.\r\n\r\nRushes are sometimes manufactured into a slight kind of baskets. In the\r\nvicinity of Farnham, in Surrey, they are cut about Midsummer, and dried in\r\nthe same manner as hay. After this they are formed into a kind of rick, and\r\nsheltered till the succeeding spring. They are then usefully employed, for\r\nbands or ties, in fastening hop-binds to the poles. In a fresh state they\r\nare sometimes made into brooms or besoms for blacksmiths, and other\r\nartisans working in metals.\r\n\r\n  115. _BARBERRIES are a beautiful red and oblong-shaped fruit, produced,\r\n  in small bunches, by a shrub_ (Berberris vulgaris) _which grows wild in\r\n  many parts of England. This shrub has somewhat oval, serrated, and\r\n  pointed leaves; thorns growing three together upon the branches; and\r\n  pendent clusters of yellow flowers._\r\n\r\nSo great is the acidity of this beautiful _fruit_ that even birds refuse to\r\neat it. In this respect it nearly approaches the tamarind. When boiled with\r\nsugar, however, it makes an agreeable preserve, rob, or jelly, according to\r\nthe different modes of preparing it. Barberries are also used as a dry\r\nsweetmeat, and in sugarplums or comfits; are pickled with vinegar, and are\r\nused for the garnishing of dishes. They are likewise well calculated to\r\nallay heat and thirst in persons afflicted with fevers. The _bark_ of this\r\nbarberry shrub is said to have been administered with effect in cases of\r\njaundice, and in some other complaints; and the inner bark, with the\r\nassistance of alum, dyes linen a fine yellow colour. The _roots_, but\r\nparticularly their bark, are employed, in Poland, in the dyeing of leather.\r\n\r\nA very singular circumstance has been stated respecting the barberry shrub;\r\nthat corn, sown near it, proves abortive, the ears being in general\r\ndestitute of grain; and that this influence is sometimes extended to a\r\ndistance of three or four hundred yards across a field. A similar opinion,\r\non this subject, prevails in France, as well as in England, but there is\r\nreason to suppose it is without foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  116. _RICE_ (Oryza sativa, Fig. 39) _is a well-known kind of grain, which\r\n  is much cultivated in the East Indies, America, and some parts of Spain;\r\n  and which, previously to its being sold for use, is freed from a brownish\r\n  husk that covers it._\r\n\r\n  _The rice plant has an erect, simple, round, and jointed stem. Its leaves\r\n  are narrow and pointed; and its flowers appear in a kind of bunch, at the\r\n  extremity, somewhat resembling, but more compact than, an ear of oats._\r\n\r\nWe are, at present, chiefly supplied with rice from America; and it is said\r\nthat the Americans were indebted for this grain to a small bag of it which\r\nwas formerly given as a present from a Mr. Dubois, treasurer of the East\r\nIndia Company, to a Carolina merchant.\r\n\r\nA wet and morassy soil, appears in general necessary to the cultivation of\r\nrice. The parts of the farms or plantations in which it is grown are\r\nusually so situated as to admit of being flooded; and, in many places,\r\nreservoirs of water are formed for this purpose. These reservoirs have\r\nsluices, by which the rice fields may be inundated at pleasure. In reaping\r\nthe crop, the labourers generally work knee deep in water and mud. As the\r\nrice is cut, the sheaves are put on drays, and carried out to be spread on\r\ndry ground. The rice thus produced has the name of _marsh rice_, and is\r\nthat which is chiefly imported into Europe.\r\n\r\nIn some of the mountainous parts of the East Indies rice is cultivated on\r\nthe sides of hills, where it can only be watered by rain. It is sown,\r\nhowever, at the beginning of the rainy, and reaped in the beginning of the\r\ndry season; so that, in fact, it has nearly all the advantages of being\r\nwatered, which the marsh rice possesses. The general appellation of rice,\r\nin the East Indies, is _paddy_; but the kind just mentioned is denominated\r\n_paddy gunung_, or _mountain rice_, and is little known in Europe, though\r\nof late years it has been cultivated with success in Tuscany. Its grains\r\nare whiter, finer, and more palatable than those of the marsh rice.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvesting of rice, the next process is to free the grains from\r\nthe husk in which they are enveloped. There are several ways of doing this.\r\nIn some places they are pounded in large mortars, and afterwards winnowed.\r\nIn others large cylindrical pestles are lifted by a wheel worked by oxen;\r\nand between these one person sits and pushes forward the rice to be beaten,\r\nwhilst another carries it off to be winnowed, and supplies fresh parcels.\r\nThe inhabitants of several parts of the East throw it into hot water, by\r\nwhich the grains are slightly swelled, and thus burst through the husk. In\r\nthe island of Ceylon, and in some parts of America, a hollow place, about a\r\nfoot in depth, and nine or ten yards in diameter, is dug in the ground.\r\nThis is filled with corn, which is trodden by oxen driven round it until\r\nthe grain is cleared. The Sacred and other writings inform us that this was\r\nthe mode which the ancients adopted with other species of grain.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, when the rice is ripe, it is gathered into sheaves, and put into\r\na mill, where the lower grinding stone is covered with cork; and, by this\r\nmeans, the grain is separated from the husk, without being bruised.\r\n\r\nRice is said to have been lately cultivated, with success, in some parts of\r\nScotland; and it is not improbable, that, by degrees, this species of grain\r\nmay be naturalized to our climate.\r\n\r\nNo kind of grain is so generally adopted for food in hot climates as this.\r\nThe inhabitants of many parts of the East subsist almost wholly upon it;\r\nand large quantities are annually imported into Europe, where it is highly\r\nesteemed for puddings and numerous culinary preparations. It is considered\r\nvery nutritive, but it should not be eaten in too large quantities by\r\nlanguid or debilitated persons. In a scarcity of other grain, rice may be\r\nused with considerable advantage as an ingredient in bread. Indeed, on\r\naccount of its excellence and its cheapness, it claims attention as a\r\ngeneral article of sustenance for the poorer classes of society; as it is\r\nwell known that a quarter of a pound of rice, slowly boiled, will yield\r\nmore than a pound of solid and nutritive food. For the fattening of\r\npoultry, boiled rice has been adopted with success, and it would be more\r\ngenerally adopted than it is, were it not for an unfounded and very\r\nextraordinary notion that it tends to make them blind.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the East obtain from rice a vinous liquor, which is more\r\nintoxicating than the strongest wine; and an ardent spirit, called\r\n_arrack_, is also partly made from it. The latter is chiefly manufactured\r\nat Batavia, and at Goa on the coast of Malabar; and is said to be distilled\r\nfrom a mixture of the wort or infusion of rice, and of toddy, or the juice\r\nof the cocoa-nut tree (233), to which other ingredients, and particularly\r\nspices, are added.\r\n\r\nThere is only one species of rice; but the varieties of it, according to\r\nthe soil, climate, and culture, are very numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS VII.--HEPTANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  117. _The HORSE-CHESNUT_ (Æsculus hippocastanum, Fig. 66) _is a very\r\n  common tree in parks and pleasure grounds, bearing leaves each composed\r\n  of seven large lobes; and having large and elegant clusters of\r\n  light-coloured flowers._\r\n\r\n  _Each flower consists of five petals of white colour, irregularly spotted\r\n  with red and yellow; and roundish, but undulated or waved at the edges.\r\n  The fruit, which is of bitter and unpleasant taste, is enclosed in a\r\n  roundish capsule or seed vessel, beset with spines, and divided into\r\n  three cells._\r\n\r\nThere is no tree of British growth more admired, or more deserving of\r\nadmiration on account of its brilliant appearance at a very early season of\r\nthe year than the chesnut. Its beautiful flowers, in upright conical\r\nspikes, terminate the branches on all sides, in such manner that sometimes\r\nalmost the whole tree appears as if it were covered by them.\r\n\r\nThe _fruit_ of the horse-chesnut has been found of considerable use in the\r\nfattening of cattle, the tallow of which it is said to render peculiarly\r\nfirm. For this purpose, however, as well as for the feeding of sheep, it\r\nhas been considered advantageous to macerate the nuts in lime water, or in\r\ncaustic alkali, to deprive them of their bitterness; and, afterwards, to\r\nwash them in water, and boil them into a paste. Goats and deer are partial\r\nto these nuts; but they are said to be unwholesome for swine. In Turkey\r\nthey are ground and mixed with provender for horses; and, if they could be\r\nwholly divested of their bitterness and acrimony, it is supposed they might\r\nbe converted into bread. A patent was granted, in the year 1796, to Lord W.\r\nMurray for his discovery of a method of extracting starch from\r\nhorse-chesnuts; and a paste or size has been made from them, which is\r\npreferred by book-binders, shoe-makers, and paper-hangers, to that made\r\nfrom wheaten flower. They contain a soapy quality, and are used, in some\r\nparts of France and Switzerland, for cleaning woollens, and for the washing\r\nand bleaching of linen; and, if ground and made into cakes or balls, it is\r\nsupposed they might answer the purpose of soap, both in washing and\r\nfulling. If a small portion of horse-chesnut, in a state of powder, be\r\nsnuffed up the nostrils, it excites sneezing; and even an infusion or\r\ndecoction of it has been said to produce a similar effect. These have\r\nconsequently been administered in some complaints of the head and eyes, and\r\nhave been productive of considerable benefit. The prickly _husks_ may be\r\nadvantageously employed in the tanning of leather.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the horse-chesnut tree is white, soft, and of little value.\r\nIt however serves occasionally for water-pipes, for mill-timber, and\r\nturners' ware. And if it be dipped into scalding oil, and well pitched, it\r\nbecomes extremely durable. In some parts of the Continent the _bark_ of\r\nthis tree is used in the cure of intermittent and other fevers; and some\r\nwriters have been of opinion that it might, with advantage, be substituted\r\nin several complaints for Peruvian bark.\r\n\r\nThis tree was first brought into Europe, from the northern parts of Asia,\r\nabout the year 1550; and its growth is so rapid, that trees, raised from\r\nnuts, have, in twelve or fourteen years, attained nearly their full\r\ndimensions. It is further remarkable, in the growth of the horse-chesnut\r\ntree, that the whole of the spring shoots are said to be completed in\r\nlittle more than three weeks from the first opening of the buds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS VIII.--OCTANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  118. _BALSAM, or BALM OF GILEAD, is the dried juice of a low tree or\r\n  shrub_ (Amyris gileadensis), _which grows in several parts of Abyssinia\r\n  and Syria._\r\n\r\n  _This tree has spreading crooked branches, small bright green leaves,\r\n  growing in threes, and small white flowers on separate footstalks. The\r\n  petals are four in number, and the fruit is a small egg-shaped berry,\r\n  containing a smooth nut._\r\n\r\nBy the inhabitants of Syria and Egypt, this balsam, as it appears from the\r\nauthority of the Scriptures, was in great esteem in the highest periods of\r\nantiquity. We are informed by Josephus, the Jewish historian, that the\r\nbalsam of Gilead was one of the trees which was given by the Queen of Saba\r\nto King Solomon. Those Ishmaelitish merchants, who were the purchasers of\r\nJoseph, are said to have been travelling from Gilead, on the eastern side\r\nof Canaan, to Egypt, having their camels laden with \"spicery, balm, and\r\nmyrrh.\" It was then, and it still is, considered one of the most valuable\r\nmedicines that the inhabitants of those countries possessed. The virtues,\r\nhowever, which have been ascribed to it, exceed all rational bounds of\r\ncredibility.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which it is obtained is described by Mr. Bruce. He says that\r\nthe bark of the trees is cut, for this purpose, with an axe, at a time when\r\nthe juices are in their strongest circulation. These, as they ooze through\r\nthe wound, are received into small earthen bottles; and every day's produce\r\nis gathered, and poured into a larger bottle, which is closely corked. When\r\nthe juice first issues from the wound, it is of light yellow colour, and\r\nsomewhat turbid appearance; but, as it settles, it becomes clear, has the\r\ncolour of honey, and appears more fixed and heavy than at first. Its smell,\r\nwhen fresh, is exquisitely fragrant, and strongly pungent, not much unlike\r\nthat of volatile salts; but, if the bottle be left uncorked, it soon loses\r\nthis quality. Its taste is bitter, acrid, aromatic, and astringent.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of balsam yielded by one tree never exceeds sixty drops in a\r\nday. Hence its scarcity is such that the genuine balsam is seldom exported\r\nas an article of commerce. Even at Constantinople, the centre of trade of\r\nthose countries, it cannot, without great difficulty, be procured. In\r\nTurkey it is in high esteem as a medicine, an odoriferous unguent, and a\r\ncosmetic. But its stimulating properties upon the skin are such that the\r\nface of a person unaccustomed to use it becomes red and swollen, and\r\ncontinues so for some days afterward. The Turks also take it in small\r\nquantities, in water, to fortify the stomach, and excite the animal\r\nfaculties.\r\n\r\n  119. _ROSE-WOOD_ (Amyris balsamifera) _is an odoriferous tree, with\r\n  smooth oval leaves, which grows in the Island of Jamaica._\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of this tree is much used by cabinet-makers in this country for\r\nthe covering or veneering of tables and other furniture. Its grain is of\r\ndark colour, and very beautiful. This tree yields an odoriferous _balsam_,\r\nwhich is much esteemed, both as an external application for the cure of\r\nwounds, and an internal medicine in various diseases.\r\n\r\n  120. _The COMMON MAPLE_ (Acer campestre) _is a low kind of tree, common\r\n  in woods and hedges, which has its leaves in lobes, blunt, and notched,\r\n  and green flowers in upright clusters._\r\n\r\nBy the Romans, the maple _wood_, when knotty and veined, was often highly\r\nprized for furniture. The poet Virgil speaks of Evander sitting on a maple\r\nthrone. The knots of this wood were considered to resemble the figure of\r\nbirds, beasts, and other animals: and when boards, large enough for tables,\r\nwere found of this curious part of it, the extravagance of purchasers is\r\nsaid to have been incredible. Indeed its value, in that madly luxurious\r\nage, is stated to have been such, that, when, at any time, the Romans\r\nreproached their wives for their extravagance in pearls, jewels, or other\r\nrich trifles, the latter were accustomed to retort, and turn the _tables_\r\nupon their husbands. Hence our expression of \"turning the tables\" upon any\r\nperson is said to have been derived.\r\n\r\nWith us the maple tree is used by turners, particularly for making cups,\r\nwhich may be rendered so thin as to be almost transparent. This wood, where\r\nit is devoid of knots, is remarkably white, and is sometimes used for\r\ndomestic furniture. On account of its lightness it is frequently employed\r\nfor musical instruments, and particularly for those of the violin kind.\r\n\r\n  121. _SUGAR MAPLE_ (Acer saccharinum) _is a North-American tree, which\r\n  grows to the height of fifty or sixty feet, and has somewhat hand-shaped\r\n  leaves, in five divisions, notched at the edges, and downy underneath._\r\n\r\nThis large and beautiful tree is much cultivated in America on account\r\nchiefly of the _juice_ which it yields, and which is made into sugar. The\r\nprocess of obtaining the juice is, in the spring of the year, to bore holes\r\nabout two inches deep into the tree, and to put into each of these holes a\r\nprojecting spout, by which it may be conveyed into troughs placed to\r\nreceive it. Each tree will afford from twenty to thirty gallons of juice,\r\nfrom which may be obtained five or six pounds of sugar. The juice is clear,\r\nof pleasant flavour; and, in its simple state, is sometimes drunk as a\r\nremedy against the scurvy. The sugar, which is obtained from it by\r\nevaporation, is clean to the eye, and very sweet, but it has a peculiar,\r\nthough not unpleasant taste. It may be clarified and refined in the same\r\nmanner as the common sugars. The juice of the maple furnishes also a\r\npleasant wine, and a very excellent vinegar.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of this tree is valuable as timber, and is also well adapted for\r\nturnery and cabinet ware, more particularly as it is said not to be liable\r\nto suffer by the depredations of insects.\r\n\r\nPossessing these properties, and being sufficiently hardy to sustain the\r\nrigours even of a cold climate, its culture, in our own country, would be\r\nattended with great advantage, and cannot be too strongly recommended.\r\n\r\n  122. _The SYCAMORE_ (Acer pseudoplatanus, Fig. 70) _is a handsome tree of\r\n  British growth, which has leaves in five lobes unequally serrated; and\r\n  green flowers in pendant clusters._\r\n\r\nIt is peculiarly deserving of remark concerning this tree, that it grows\r\nbetter near the sea than in any other situation, and that plantations of\r\nsycamores may be so made as even to defend the herbage of the adjacent\r\ncountry from the spray, and consequently from the injurious effects of the\r\nsea. Its growth is quick, yet it will increase in size until it is two\r\nhundred years old. The soil in which it best flourishes is a loose black\r\nearth. The only inconveniences attending it in plantations is the early\r\nshedding of its leaves.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year the inhabitants of some parts of Scotland bore\r\nholes through the bark of the sycamore, at the distance of about twelve\r\ninches from the root, and suffer the _juice_ to drain into vessels, to the\r\namount of eight or nine quarts a day from each tree. This liquor they\r\nconvert into a kind of wine; and, if the watery part were evaporated, a\r\nuseful sugar might be obtained from it.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the sycamore is soft and white, and was formerly much in\r\nrequest by turners, for making trenchers, dishes, bowls, and other\r\narticles; but, since the general introduction of earthen-ware for all these\r\npurposes, its value has greatly decreased.\r\n\r\n  123. _CRANBERRIES are a small red fruit with purple dots, produced by a\r\n  slender wiry plant_ (Vaccinium oxycoccos), _which grows in the peaty bogs\r\n  of several parts of the north of England, and also in Norfolk,\r\n  Lincolnshire, and Cambridgeshire._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves are small, somewhat oval, and rolled back at the edges, and\r\n  the stem is thread-shaped and trailing. The blossoms are small, but\r\n  beautiful, each consisting of four distinct petals rolled back to the\r\n  base, and of deep flesh colour._\r\n\r\nThe collecting of cranberries is a tiresome and disagreeable employment, as\r\neach berry, which seldom exceeds the size of a pea, grows on a separate\r\nstalk, and the morasses in which they grow are frequently very deep.\r\nCranberries are much used in the northern counties, and great quantities of\r\nthem are bottled and sent to London. So considerable a traffic in this\r\nfruit is carried on, that, at Longtown in Cumberland, the amount of a\r\nmarket day's sale, during the season for gathering it, is stated by Dr.\r\nWithering to be from 20_l._ to 30_l._ Cranberries begin to ripen about the\r\nmonth of August, and continue in perfection for some weeks.\r\n\r\nThey are much used in confectionary, but particularly in tarts; their rich\r\nflavour being very generally esteemed. The usual mode of preserving them is\r\nin dry bottles, corked so closely as to exclude all access of the external\r\nair: some persons, however, fill up the bottles with spring water. Others\r\nprepare this fruit with sugar. From the juice of cranberries, mixed with a\r\ncertain portion of sugar, and properly fermented, a grateful and wholesome\r\nwine may be made. The inhabitants of Sweden use this fruit only for the\r\ncleaning of silver plate.\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of cranberries is annually imported, into this\r\ncountry, from North America and Russia. These are larger than our own, of a\r\ndifferent species, and by no means of so pleasant flavour.\r\n\r\n124. There are three other species of fruit belonging to the cranberry\r\ntribe, which grow wild in this country, on heaths or in woods. These are\r\nBILBERRIES, or BLEA-BERRIES (_Vaccinium myrtillus_), which are occasionally\r\neaten in milk, and in tarts, and which afford a violet-coloured dye: GREAT\r\nBILBERRIES (_V. uliginosum_), which, in France, are sometimes employed to\r\ntinge white wines red: and RED WHORTLE-BERRIES (_V. vitis idæa_), which,\r\nthough not of very grateful flavour, are occasionally used in tarts, rob,\r\nand jelly.\r\n\r\n  125. _The COMMON HEATH, or LING_ (Erica vulgaris), _is a well-known\r\n  plant, with numerous small rose-coloured flowers, which grows wild on\r\n  heaths and mountainous wastes, in nearly every part of England._\r\n\r\nThe principal use to which the heath is applied is for making brooms or\r\nbesoms. It is likewise bound into fagots, and employed as fuel,\r\nparticularly for ovens; and is, not unfrequently, employed in the filling\r\nup of drains, and the morassy parts of roads, previously to their being\r\ncovered with earth, stones, and other durable materials. In the Highlands\r\nof Scotland, the poorer inhabitants make walls, for their cottages, with\r\nalternate layers of heath and a kind of mortar made of black earth and\r\nstraw: they likewise thatch their cabins with it, and make their beds of\r\nit. The inhabitants of Islay, one of the western islands of Scotland, are\r\nsaid to brew a wholesome kind of beer from one part of malt, and two parts\r\nof the young tops of heath. The _stalks_ and _tops_ may be rendered of\r\nconsiderable service in the tanning of leather; and in dyeing woollen cloth\r\nan orange colour. Bees are partial to the _flowers_; but the honey which\r\nthey form, after having fed upon these flowers, acquires a reddish tint.\r\nThe _leaves_ and _seeds_ of heath afford a grateful food to grouse, and\r\nother animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  126. _BUCKWHEAT, or BRANK, is a black and triangular grain, produced by a\r\n  plant of the persicaria tribe_ (Polygonum fagopyrum), _with somewhat\r\n  arrow-shaped leaves, and purplish white flowers._\r\n\r\nAlthough buckwheat may now be considered as in some degree naturalized in\r\nthis country, and as growing wild near our fields and dunghills, it was\r\noriginally introduced from the northern parts of Asia, and was first\r\ncultivated here about the year 1600. The flowers appear about July, and the\r\nseeds ripen in October; and so tender are the plants, that a single night's\r\nsharp frost will destroy a whole crop.\r\n\r\nAs a grain, buckwheat has been principally cultivated for oxen, swine, and\r\npoultry; and although some farmers state that a single bushel of it is\r\nequal in quality to two bushels of oats, others assert that it is a very\r\nunprofitable food. Mixed with bran, chaff, or grains, it is sometimes given\r\nto horses. The flower of buckwheat is occasionally used for bread, but more\r\nfrequently for the thin cakes called crumpets. In Germany it serves as an\r\ningredient in pottage, puddings, and other food. Beer may be brewed from\r\nit; and, by distillation, it yields an excellent spirit.\r\n\r\nThe best mode of harvesting this grain is said to be by pulling it out of\r\nthe ground like flax, stripping off the seeds by the hand, and collecting\r\nthese into aprons, or cloths tied round the waist.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat is much cultivated in the domains of noblemen and gentlemen\r\npossessed of landed property, as a food for pheasants. With some farmers it\r\nis the practice to sow buckwheat for the purpose only of ploughing it into\r\nthe ground, as a manure for the land. Whilst green, it serves as food for\r\nsheep and oxen; and, mixed with other provender, it may also be given, with\r\nadvantage to horses. The _blossoms_ may be used for dyeing a brown colour.\r\n\r\nThe principal advantage of buckwheat is, that it is capable of being\r\ncultivated upon land which will produce scarcely any thing else, and that\r\nits culture, comparatively with that of other grain, is attended with\r\nlittle expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS IX.--ENNEANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  127. _CINNAMON is the under bark of the branches of a tree of the bay\r\n  tribe_ (Laurus cinnamomum, Fig. 40,) _which is chiefly found in the\r\n  island of Ceylon, but which also grows in Malabar and other parts of the\r\n  East Indies._\r\n\r\n  _This tree attains the height of twenty or thirty feet. Its leaves are\r\n  oval, each from four to six inches long, and marked with three principal\r\n  nerves. The flowers stand on slender footstalks, and are of pale yellow\r\n  colour; and the fruit is somewhat shaped like an acorn._\r\n\r\nThere are two principal seasons of the year in which the Ceylonese enter\r\ntheir woods for the purpose of barking the cinnamon trees. The first of\r\nthese commences in April, and the last in November: but the former is that\r\nin which the great crop is obtained. In this operation the branches of\r\nthree years' growth are cut down, and the outside pellicle of the bark is\r\nscraped away. The twigs are then ripped up lengthways with a knife, and the\r\nbark is gradually loosened till it can be entirely taken off. It is then\r\ncut into slices, which, on being exposed to the sun, curl up in drying. The\r\nsmaller pieces or quills, as they are called, are inserted into the larger\r\nones, and the whole are afterwards tied into bundles.\r\n\r\nCinnamon is examined and arranged, according to its quality, by persons\r\nwho, for this purpose, are obliged to taste and chew it. This is a very\r\ntroublesome and disagreeable work; and few persons are able to continue it\r\nmore than two or three days successively, as the cinnamon deprives the\r\ntongue and lips of all the mucus with which they are covered. After this\r\nexamination, the bundles are made up to the length of about four feet, and\r\nweight of eighty-eight pounds each.\r\n\r\nFrom the roots of the trees numerous offsets shoot up. These, when they\r\nhave attained the height of about ten feet, are cut down and barked, being\r\nthen about the thickness of a common walking-stick. The cinnamon which they\r\nyield is much finer than any other.\r\n\r\nA French ship, bound in 1782, from the island of Bourbon, to Cape François\r\nin St. Domingo, and having on board various oriental productions, the\r\ncinnamon tree among the rest, was taken by the late Admiral Rodney, who\r\npresented the trees to the assembly of Jamaica; and, from this parent\r\nstock, different parts of that island were afterwards supplied. In Ceylon\r\nthe cinnamon trees are said to be so common as to be used for fuel and\r\nother domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nThe smell of cinnamon, particularly of the thinnest pieces, is delightfully\r\nfragrant; and its taste is pungent and aromatic, with considerable\r\nsweetness and astringency. If infused in boiling water in a covered vessel,\r\nit gives out much of its grateful flavour, and forms an agreeable liquid.\r\nAn oil is extracted from cinnamon, which is heavier than water. This is\r\nprepared in Ceylon, and almost wholly from the small and broken pieces. It\r\nis, however, obtained in such small quantity that the oil of cassia (128)\r\nis generally substituted for it. Indeed the cassia bark is often\r\nsubstituted for cinnamon, to which it has considerable resemblance,\r\nalthough, in its qualities, it is much weaker, and although it is\r\nimmediately distinguishable by its slimy taste.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of cinnamon are not confined to the bark. The _leaves_, the\r\n_fruit_, and the _root_ all yield oil of considerable value. That from the\r\nfruit is highly fragrant, of thick consistence, and, in Ceylon, was\r\nformerly made into candles for the exclusive use of the king.\r\n\r\n  128. _WILD CINNAMON, or CASSIA, is the bark of a tree of the bay tribe_\r\n  (Laurus cassia), _which grows in the East Indies and China, and is\r\n  distinguished by having spear-shaped leaves, each with three nerves._\r\n\r\nThis _bark_ was well known to the ancients, and highly esteemed by them:\r\nbut, since the use of cinnamon has been generally adopted, the cassia bark\r\nhas fallen into disrepute on account of its inferiority. It is thicker and\r\nmore coarse than cinnamon, of weaker quality, and abounds more with a\r\nviscid mucilaginous matter. For many purposes, however, cassia, as being\r\nmuch less expensive, is substituted for cinnamon, but more particularly for\r\nthe preparation of what is called oil of cinnamon: and nearly the whole of\r\nwhat is at present sold under the name either of simple or spirituous\r\ncinnamon water is prepared from cassia.\r\n\r\nThe _buds_, as well as the _bark_, of this tree are used in culinary\r\npreparations, and for several other purposes. They are chiefly imported\r\nfrom China.\r\n\r\n  129. _CAMPHOR is a white resinous production of peculiar and powerful\r\n  smell, which is extracted from two or three kinds of trees of the bay\r\n  tribe that grow in the islands of the East Indies, and in China._\r\n\r\n  _Of these the principal is_ Laurus camphora (Fig. 41). _It is of\r\n  considerable height, much branched, and has spear-shaped leaves, with\r\n  nerves, of pale yellowish green colour on the upper side, and bluish\r\n  green beneath. The flowers are small and white, and stand on stalks which\r\n  issue from the junction of the leaves and branches._\r\n\r\nCamphor is found in every part of the trees; in the interstices of the\r\nperpendicular fibres, and in veins of the wood; in the crevices and knots,\r\nin the pith, and in the roots. The modes by which it is extracted differ in\r\ndifferent countries. In Borneo and Sumatra, the largest pieces are picked\r\nout with sharp instruments; and the smaller ones are procured by rasps, to\r\nwhich, along with bits of wood and other impurities, they adhere. The\r\nChinese cut off the branches, chop them very small, and place them in\r\nspring water for some days. They then put them into a kettle, and boil them\r\nfor a certain time, during which they keep constantly stirring them with a\r\nstick. As soon as the camphor, in a white and frosted appearance, is\r\nobserved to adhere to the stick, the whole is strained. The liquor is\r\nsubsequently poured into a basin, and, after some hours, the camphor\r\ncoagulates into a solid mass.\r\n\r\nIn Japan it is usual to obtain camphor by cutting the roots and extremities\r\nof the branches into chips, and exposing them to the steam of water in\r\nclose vessels. In other countries the roots, wood, and leaves, are all\r\nboiled in large iron pots, having a kind of tubular apparatus, which is\r\nstuffed with straw, and leads to certain large vessels called receivers. In\r\nthis operation most of the camphor becomes condensed in a solid form\r\namongst the straw; and the remainder passes with the water into the\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\nIn a crude state camphor is formed into irregular lumps of yellowish grey\r\ncolour, somewhat resembling nitre, or saltpetre. It is imported into Europe\r\nin canisters; and the refining of it was long kept a secret by the\r\nVenetians. The Dutch have since performed this work; and large quantities\r\nof camphor are now also refined by some of the English chemists. The best\r\ncamphor is imported from Sumatra.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of this drug is in medicine; and it was formerly in high\r\nrepute. Dr. Cullen says that it has been employed with advantage in fevers\r\nof almost all kinds: but, since the free use of opium has been introduced,\r\ncamphor has been little employed in this country, though its utility has\r\nbeen fully established by some of the most eminent practitioners of the\r\nContinent. It has often been found to relieve tooth-ache and rheumatism.\r\nSeveral preparations of camphor, in combination with other substances, are\r\nused in medicine, of which, perhaps, the most common is that with spirit of\r\nwine. To insects the effluvium of camphor is so disagreeable that they\r\nquickly avoid it. Hence it is customary to place pieces of it in\r\ncollections of natural history, to prevent their destruction by these\r\nvoracious little creatures.\r\n\r\nFor carpenters' work the _wood_ of the camphor tree is much in request. It\r\nis light and durable; and, in consequence of long retaining its aromatic\r\nsmell, is not liable to be injured by insects.\r\n\r\nPlants of the camphor and cinnamon trees were captured, from the French, in\r\n1782, by Admiral Rodney, and afterwards conveyed to Jamaica, and propagated\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nSeveral shrubs and plants of our own country contain camphor in\r\nconsiderable quantity. The principal of these are _rosemary_, _sage_,\r\n_lavender_, and _marjoram_.\r\n\r\n  130. _The COMMON SWEET BAY_ (Laurus nobilis) _is an evergreen shrub,\r\n  which grows in Italy and other southern parts of Europe, and is\r\n  principally celebrated as that which was anciently used to form the crown\r\n  of victory among poets._\r\n\r\n  _Its leaves are of shining green colour, somewhat spear-shaped, and often\r\n  waved towards the edge. The flowers appear in April and May, in clusters\r\n  of three or four together on short footstalks. The corolla is in four\r\n  segments of yellowish white colour, and is succeeded by an oval berry\r\n  covered with a dark green rind._\r\n\r\nThis handsome shrub is common in our gardens and shrubberies. Its _leaves_\r\nafford, by distillation, an useful oil, which is occasionally employed in\r\nmedicine. They are also employed, in cookery, to flavour custards,\r\npuddings, stews, and pickles; and Dr. Woodville assures us that they may\r\nthus be used not only with safety, but even with advantage, as assisting\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nThe _berries_ or fruit of the bay tree, which have an aromatic smell, and a\r\nwarm, bitterish, and pungent taste, were much used by the ancient Romans\r\nfor culinary purposes. We import them chiefly from the coasts of the\r\nMediterranean. From the berries, in a recent state, the people of Spain and\r\nItaly obtain, by pressure, a green aromatic oil, which is employed in\r\nmedicine, externally, as a stimulant in nervous, paralytic, and other\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\n  131. _The ALLIGATOR PEAR is a pear-shaped fruit, produced by a species of\r\n  bay tree_ (Laurus persea), _that is much cultivated in the West Indies._\r\n\r\n  _This tree, which is an evergreen, has a straight stem, and grows to a\r\n  considerable height. Its leaves are somewhat oval, leathery, transversely\r\n  veined, and of beautiful green colour; and the flowers grow in bunches._\r\n\r\nTo the inhabitants of the West Indian islands, particularly the negroes,\r\nthis _fruit_, which ripens in the months of August and September, is an\r\nagreeable, and, in some respects, an important article of diet. When ripe\r\nthe pulp is of yellow colour, of consistence somewhat harder than that of\r\nbutter, and, in taste, not much unlike marrow. The negroes frequently make\r\ntheir meals of these pears, a little salt, and plantains; and they are\r\noccasionally served up at the tables of the white people as fruit.\r\n\r\nTheir exterior surface is covered with a green skin; and in the centre\r\nthere is a large round seed or _stone_, extremely hard and woody, with an\r\nuneven surface. This stone is used for the marking of linen. The cloth is\r\nheld or tied over the stone; and the letters are pricked by a needle,\r\nthrough the cloth, into the outer covering of the stone. By this means it\r\nis stained of an indelible reddish brown colour, in the direction along\r\nwhich the needle has passed. The _leaves_ are used by the negroes\r\nmedicinally.\r\n\r\n  132. _SASSAFRAS is the wood of a North American tree of the bay tribe_\r\n  (Lauras sassafras), _and is imported into Europe in long straight pieces,\r\n  which are of light and porous texture, and covered with a rough fungous\r\n  bark._\r\n\r\n  _This tree is sometimes twenty or thirty feet high. The branches are\r\n  crooked, and the leaves various, both in form and size, some of them\r\n  being oval and entire, and others having two or three lobes. They are\r\n  pale green, and downy beneath. The flowers, which are of a dingy yellow\r\n  colour, appear in pendant spikes._\r\n\r\nThis _wood_ has a fragrant smell, and an aromatic and somewhat acrid,\r\nthough sweetish taste, that are also observable in the _bark_, the smaller\r\n_twigs_, and the _roots_, all of which are imported into this country as\r\nwell as the wood. Infusions and decoctions of sassafras are frequently\r\ntaken as a medicine for improving the tone of the stomach and bowels, in\r\npersons whose humours are in a vitiated state. Soon after its introduction\r\ninto Europe, in the year 1560, this medicine was in such high repute as to\r\nbe sold, on the Continent, at the rate of fifty livres per pound; and its\r\nvirtues were extolled in numerous publications that were written on the\r\nsubject. It is, however, now considered of little importance; and sassafras\r\nis seldom employed but in conjunction with other medicines, which, in their\r\nnature, are more powerful. Infusions of sassafras are sold in the streets\r\nof London, under the name of _saloop_.\r\n\r\nWe are informed that, in many parts of America, where the sassafras trees\r\nnot only grow in great numbers in the woods, but are planted along the\r\nfences of enclosures, it is not unusual to make bed-posts of the wood, for\r\nthe purpose of expelling bugs. Its powerful scent drives away these\r\ndisagreeable insects; and some persons put chips of sassafras into their\r\nwardrobes and chests, to prevent the attack of moths. This wood serves for\r\nthe posts of enclosures, to which, by its lasting nature in the ground, it\r\nis peculiarly adapted.\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ of the sassafras tree is used by the American women for dyeing\r\nworsted, which it does of a permanent and beautiful orange colour.\r\n\r\n  133. _The CASHEW NUT is a small kidney-formed nut, which grows at the\r\n  extremity of a somewhat pear-shaped Indian fruit._\r\n\r\n  _The tree which produces it_ (Anacardium occidentale, Fig. 42) _somewhat\r\n  resembles a walnut tree in shape, as well as in the smell of its leaves,\r\n  which are leathery, somewhat oval and shining. The flowers are red, and\r\n  sweet-scented._\r\n\r\nThe size of this _fruit_ is nearly that of a large pear, and the colour of\r\nits pulp is sometimes yellow and sometimes red. The singularity of its\r\nform, with a nut or stone at the extremity, instead of the centre,\r\ngenerally excites the surprise of persons when they first see it. In a ripe\r\nstate the fruit is sometimes roasted, cut in slices, and used as an\r\nagreeable acid in punch. Its juice, when fermented, is made into wine; and,\r\non distillation, yields a spirit which some persons prefer even to rum.\r\n\r\nThe _nuts_ are each enclosed in two shells, connected together by a\r\ncellular substance, which contains a thick, inflammable, and very caustic\r\noil. The kernels of these nuts have a peculiarly sweet and pleasant\r\nflavour, and are eaten either raw or roasted, and sometimes even pickled.\r\nIt is said that the negroes of Brazil, who eat of these nuts as part of\r\ntheir sustenance, find them peculiarly wholesome, and that they are\r\nrelieved, by the use of them, from various disorders of the stomach. They\r\nare also used in medicine, as almonds; and, when ground with the chocolate\r\nnut, they greatly improve its flavour. Cashew nuts may be kept, without any\r\ngreat alteration of their quality, for many years. If the shells be broken,\r\nand the nuts be laid for a little while on the fire, they open of\r\nthemselves; and the kernels being taken out, the thin brown skin which\r\ncovers them must be removed previously to their being eaten. It is\r\nnecessary to be cautious, respecting the oil, that it do not come in\r\ncontact with the mouth or lips; as, in such case, it would inflame and\r\nexcoriate them.\r\n\r\nThe _oil_ of the cashew nut is sometimes applied, by the inhabitants of the\r\nWest Indies (though much caution is requisite in the use of it) as a means\r\nof corroding cancerous ulcers, corns, and ring-worms; and some of the West\r\nIndian ladies, when they imagine themselves too much tanned by the\r\nscorching rays of the sun, cut off the outer shell of the nut, and rub the\r\noil upon their faces as a cosmetic. The immediate consequences of this\r\nextraordinary operation are swelling and blackness of the parts; and, in\r\nfive or six days, the whole skin peels off, leaving the face so sore and\r\ntender, that it is impossible for the person using it to appear abroad in\r\nless than a fortnight; by which time the new skin is sufficiently hardened,\r\nand is as fair as that of a newly-born infant. There are, however, few\r\nBritish females who would consent to be thus flayed alive for the sake of\r\nrendering themselves fair. This oil tinges linen a permanent rusty iron\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nFrom the Cashew nut tree a milky _juice_ is obtained, by tapping or\r\nincision, which stains, of a deep black colour, whatever it touches. The\r\nfine black varnish so much used in China and Japan is the resinous juice of\r\na tree called _fsi-chu_, which is conjectured to be the cashew nut tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  134. _The TRUE or OFFICINAL RHUBARB_ (Rheum palmatum) _is a medicinal\r\n  root which grows wild in various parts of Asia._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves which issue from this root are large, and deeply cut into\r\n  lobes; and the whole plant has a general resemblance to what in our\r\n  country are called docks. The stem is erect and six or seven feet high.\r\n  The leaves stand on footstalks, that are somewhat grooved above, and\r\n  rounded at the edge. Those which proceed from the stalk supply at the\r\n  joints a kind of membraneous sheaths. The flowers terminate the branches\r\n  in clusters._\r\n\r\nThe importance and the properties of this _root_ in medicine are\r\nuniversally known. Rhubarb is usually imported from Turkey, but it is\r\noccasionally also brought from Russia, China, and the East Indies. Dr.\r\nWoodville states that the _Turkey rhubarb_ is brought over in oblong\r\npieces, flattish on one side, and rounded on the other; and that it is\r\ncompact, hard, heavy, and internally of a dull colour, variegated with\r\nyellow and white. The _Chinese rhubarb_ is in roundish pieces, each with a\r\nlarge hole through the centre. It is softer than the former, and exhibits,\r\nwhen broken, many streaks of bright red colour.\r\n\r\nIn some of the mountains of Tartary, rhubarb plants are found in great\r\nabundance. The roots, when first dug out of the ground, are thick, fleshy,\r\nexternally of yellowish brown colour, and internally of bright yellow\r\nstreaked with red veins. When they have attained sufficient size, they are\r\ndug up and cleansed; and the small fibres and the rind being cut off, they\r\nare divided into pieces of proper size. Each piece is then perforated in\r\nthe middle, and they are strung on cords in such manner as not to touch\r\neach other, and are suspended to dry, either upon adjacent trees, or in the\r\ntents.\r\n\r\nThe sum expended for the importation of this drug is said to exceed\r\n200,000_l._ per annum, a great proportion of which, it is presumed, might\r\nbe saved to the country by cultivation of the plants in Great Britain. This\r\nwas first attempted, about sixty years ago, by Dr. Hope, in the botanic\r\ngarden at Edinburgh, and with such success as to prove that the climate\r\neven of Scotland would be no obstacle to its increase. In 1791, Sir William\r\nFordyce received from the Society for Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures,\r\nand Commerce, a gold medal, for having raised more than 300 plants of the\r\ntrue rhubarb from seed. And, in 1783, Mr. Davis, of Minehead, in\r\nSomersetshire, brought to perfection as many plants as yielded three\r\nhundred pounds' weight of dried rhubarb. Since this period, rhubarb has\r\nbeen grown, in different parts of England, to great extent; and has so far\r\nflourished, that some of the roots have weighed seventy pounds and upwards.\r\nThe principal difficulty has attended the curing of it; but this, after\r\nnumerous experiments, has at length been performed in such manner, that the\r\nEnglish drug has been found equal, or nearly equal, to that which is\r\nimported from Turkey and China.\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ of rhubarb has been used for tinctures, and found, in every\r\nrespect, as efficacious as the best part of the roots: and the _seeds_\r\npossess nearly the same qualities. The _leaves_ impart an agreeable\r\nacidity, somewhat similar to that of sorrel; and a marmalade, which may,\r\nwith advantage, be adopted for children, is made from the fresh _stalks_,\r\nby stripping off the bark, and boiling the pulp with an equal quantity of\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n  135. _The COMMON RHUBARB_ (Rheum rhaponticum), _is a plant which is\r\n  cultivated in kitchen gardens, and has large, blunt and smooth leaves,\r\n  and the leaf-stalks furrowed on the upper side, and rounded at the edge._\r\n\r\nThis species of rhubarb grows wild on the mountains of Rhodope, in Thrace,\r\nwhence it was first propagated in other parts of Europe, about the year\r\n1630. It is chiefly in request for the _footstalks of the leaves_, which\r\nare used, (in the early part of the year, when there is little fruit) for\r\npies and tarts. The _root_ has some of the qualities of the true rhubarb,\r\nand has occasionally been imposed upon purchasers for that drug.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS X.--DECANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  136. _SENNA is a drug, the dried leaves of an annual plant_ (Cassia\r\n  senna) _which grows in various parts of Africa and Asia._\r\n\r\n  _The stems of this plant are woody, and not unlike those of a shrub. The\r\n  leaves are winged, and the leaflets oval, smooth, and pointed. The\r\n  flowers, which grow in lengthened clusters, and are of pale yellow\r\n  colour, are succeeded by oblong, compressed, and kidney-shaped pods._\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of senna is carried on to considerable extent in Ethiopia,\r\nArabia, Persia, and Upper Egypt, from several of which countries it has,\r\nfrom time immemorial, been brought by the caravans to Alexandria, as the\r\nmost convenient port whence it could be shipped or sold into Europe. From\r\nthis circumstance, it is sometimes denominated _Alexandrian senna_. The\r\nprocess of stripping and drying the leaves is perfectly simple. When dried,\r\nthey are of a yellowish green colour, have a faint, though not unpleasant\r\nsmell, and a somewhat acrid, bitterish, and nauseous taste.\r\n\r\nThese leaves have long been in use in Eastern countries as a medicine; and\r\ntheir repute, though not so great as in the East, is very considerable in\r\nEurope. They are administered in various ways; and the _pods_ have the same\r\neffect as the leaves.\r\n\r\nA kind of senna has of late been cultivated, with success, in Italy and\r\nsome of the southern parts of France.\r\n\r\n  137. _The OFFICINAL CASSIA is a somewhat cylindrical pod, about an inch\r\n  in diameter, and a foot or more in length, the fruit of a tree_ (Cassia\r\n  fistula) _which is cultivated in Egypt, the East and West Indies, and\r\n  South America._\r\n\r\n  _This tree is forty or fifty feet high, and much branched. Its leaves are\r\n  winged, with five pair of leaflets, somewhat oval, pointed, smooth, and\r\n  of pale green colour. The flowers are large, yellow, and grow in oblong\r\n  clusters. The pods are divided, by transverse partitions, into numerous\r\n  cells, each containing one seed._\r\n\r\nThese pods are in request on account of the black, sweetish, but somewhat\r\nacid _pulp_, which is contained in their cells, and which is used, in many\r\ncases, as a mild opening medicine. It is customary in Egypt to pluck the\r\npods before they are quite ripe, and to place them in a house, from which\r\nthe external air is, as much as possible, excluded. They are then laid in\r\nbeds about six inches deep, having palm leaves interposed betwixt them. On\r\nthe two following days the whole are sprinkled with water; and, in the\r\ncourse of about six weeks, they are in a fit state to be packed for sale.\r\n\r\nThe East Indian and West Indian cassia somewhat differ, both in appearance\r\nand qualities. Of the former the pods are smoother, smaller, and have a\r\nthinner rind; and the pulp is of a deeper shining black colour, sweeter,\r\nand more agreeable to the taste. In choosing cassia, those pods should be\r\nselected which are the heaviest, and in which the seeds do not rattle on\r\nbeing shaken.\r\n\r\n  138. _LIGNUM VITÆ and GUIACUM are the wood and resin of a large West\r\n  Indian tree_ (Guiacum officinale, Fig. 77) _which has winged leaves in\r\n  two sets upon one footstalk, and regular flowers of five petals._\r\n\r\n  _The usual height of this tree is between thirty and forty feet. The\r\n  leaves consist of two, three, and sometimes four pairs of leaflets, which\r\n  are somewhat oval, and of shining dark green colour. The flowers spring,\r\n  in clusters, from the division of the smaller branches; the petals are of\r\n  a rich blue colour, and the stamens are crowned with yellowish anthers._\r\n\r\nThe _wood_, resin, bark, and even the flowers of this tree, are all of use\r\neither in the mechanical arts or in medicine. The former, which is yellow\r\ntowards the outside, of deep blackish brown colour in the centre, and so\r\ncompact and heavy as to sink, when immersed in water, is chiefly employed\r\nin the West Indies for the wheels and cogs of sugar mills. It is also\r\nformed into mortars, bowls, and domestic utensils of various kinds, for\r\nwhich, on account of its hardness, and not being liable to warp, it is\r\npeculiarly valuable. Lignum vitae is chiefly imported into this country\r\nfrom Jamaica, in logs or pieces of four or five hundred pounds' weight\r\neach, and is in great request for school-boys' rulers, and numerous\r\narticles of turnery ware. A decoction of the wood, when rasped, is\r\noccasionally administered as a medicine in rheumatic and gouty affections.\r\n\r\nThe _resin_ of this tree is sometimes obtained by wounding the bark in\r\ndifferent parts. It exudes through the wounds; and, when sufficiently\r\nhardened by exposure to the sun, is taken off, and packed in small kegs for\r\nexportation. Sometimes it is obtained by sawing the wood into billets, each\r\nabout three feet in length, which are then bored with an augur\r\nlongitudinally, and laid upon a fire, in such position that the melted\r\nresin, which flows through the hole as the wood burns, may be received into\r\na vessel placed for the purpose of containing it. This resin, which is\r\nfrequently called _gum guiacum_, is of a greenish colour, but has sometimes\r\na reddish hue. Its taste is pungent and acrid. From the bark of the tree\r\nthere is frequently a spontaneous exudation: this has the name of _native\r\ngum_, and is imported in small, irregular, bright pieces, which are much\r\nmore pure than the gum obtained in any other way. Guiacum is used as a\r\nstrengthening medicine, and a warm aromatic; it is employed as a remedy\r\nagainst rheumatic and other pains, and as an ingredient in many officinal\r\npreparations. On its first introduction, which was soon after the discovery\r\nof America, it was in such repute as to have been sold for seven crowns a\r\npound.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies, the _bark_, _flowers_, and _fruit_, are each employed\r\nin medicine; and of these the former is frequently used instead of soap for\r\nwashing, in which process it gives a good lather.\r\n\r\n  139. _BALSAM OF TOLU is a reddish yellow, thick, and pellucid substance,\r\n  of fragrant odour, which is obtained from a tree_ (Toluifera balsamum)\r\n  _which grows in South America._\r\n\r\n  _This tree is of considerable height; and has somewhat oval leaves, each\r\n  on a short foot-stalk. The flowers are numerous, and in lateral branches;\r\n  and the fruit is a round berry._\r\n\r\nThe name of this balsam has been obtained from its being chiefly procured\r\nfrom the province of Tolu, on the north coast of South America, near the\r\nisthmus of Panama. Incisions are made in the bark of the trees, at a\r\nparticular season of the year, and a resinous fluid of yellowish white\r\ncolour oozes out. This is collected in small gourd shells. At first it is\r\nabout the consistence of treacle, but it thickens by being kept; and by age\r\nit becomes hard and brittle. Its smell is peculiarly grateful, somewhat\r\nresembling that of lemons; and its taste is warm and sweetish. On being\r\nchewed, it adheres to the teeth.\r\n\r\nThis balsam is used in medicine both in the form of a tincture, and a\r\nsyrup; and, in its medicinal virtues, it agrees with most other balsams.\r\nThe syrup of Tolu is used in several medicines; and is also made into\r\nlozenges, which may be procured of almost any chemist, and which are\r\nconsidered serviceable in appeasing the irritation occasioned by severe\r\ncoughing.\r\n\r\n  140. _BENZOIN or GUM BENJAMIN, is a concrete or solid and fragrant\r\n  balsamic substance, the produce of a tree_ (Styrax benzoe) _which grows\r\n  chiefly in the island of Sumatra._\r\n\r\n  _This tree has oblong leaves which taper to a pointy and are smooth on\r\n  the upper surface, and downy beneath. The flowers are in loose bunches;\r\n  they usually hang all on the same side; and are generally closed, which\r\n  gives them the appearance of buds._\r\n\r\nIn some of the northern parts of Sumatra, particularly near the sea coast,\r\nthere are several extensive plantations of Benzoin trees. The seeds or nuts\r\nare sown in the rice fields, and they afterwards require no other attention\r\nthan that the surrounding shrubs should be cleared away from about the\r\nyoung plants.\r\n\r\nWhen the trees have attained the age of six or seven years, incisions are\r\nmade into the bark; and from these the balsam exudes, in the form of a\r\nthick, whitish, resinous juice. By exposure to the air, this juice soon\r\nhardens; it is then pared from the bark with a knife or chisel. For the\r\nfirst three years the trees yield the purest resins: this is of a white\r\ncolour inclining to yellow, is soft and fragrant. Afterwards, for the next\r\nseven or eight years, an inferior sort is yielded; this is of reddish\r\nyellow colour, degenerating to brown. At length the trees, unable to bear a\r\nrepetition of the process, are cut down, and split into pieces. From these\r\nis procured by scraping, a still worse sort of benzoin, which is\r\ndark-coloured, hard, and mixed, more or less, with parings of the wood and\r\nother impurities.\r\n\r\nThe inferior sorts of benzoin are exported to Arabia, Persia, and some\r\nparts of India, where they are burned, to perfume, with their smoke, the\r\ntemples and the houses of the inhabitants; to expel troublesome insects,\r\nand obviate the pernicious effects of unwholesome air or noxious\r\nexhalations.\r\n\r\nBenzoin is brought for sale to the mercantile parts of Sumatra, in large\r\ncakes, covered with mats. In order to pack it in chests, it is necessary to\r\nbreak these cakes, and to expose it to the heat of the sun. The greater\r\npart of the benzoin which is brought to England is re-exported to countries\r\nwhere the Roman Catholic and Mahometan religions prevail; to be there\r\nburned as incense in the churches and temples. The annual exportation of\r\nbenzoin from London to Mogadore only has been estimated at 30,000 pounds'\r\nweight per annum.\r\n\r\nThat which is consumed in England is chiefly employed in medicine, in\r\nperfumes, and as cosmetics. It constitutes the basis of what are called\r\n_Turlington's_ or _Friar's balsam_, and _Jesuit's drops_; the salutary\r\neffects of which, particularly in healing recent wounds, is well known.\r\nThis balsam is composed of benzoin, balsam of Tolu (139), Socotrine aloes\r\n(107), and rectified spirit of wine. Benzoin is also used in the\r\npreparation of what is called _ladies' court plaster_; but in this it is\r\nsupposed to be unnecessary if not prejudicial; not only as it renders the\r\nplaster more difficult to be moistened, previously to its application, but\r\nas the irritating quality of the benzoin may in some instances dispose a\r\nfresh wound to fester. The mode of making court plaster is very simple.\r\nFive ounces of isinglass are dissolved in a pint of water. A quantity of\r\nthin black sarsnet being then stretched on a frame, a warm solution of the\r\nisinglass is applied with a brush equally over the surface; and, when dry,\r\nthis is repeated a second or third time. It is finally brushed over with a\r\nweak solution of benzoin in spirits of wine, which communicates to it a\r\npleasant aromatic smell.\r\n\r\nIf powdered benzoin be put into an earthen vessel over a slow fire, and the\r\nfumes of it be made to sublime into a paper cone fixed to the top of the\r\npot, the substance thus formed is the _flowers of benzoin_ of the shops, or\r\n_Benzoic acid_, as it is termed, by chemists.\r\n\r\n  141. _STORAX is a fragrant, concrete, or solid balsam, that is obtained\r\n  from a tree_ (Styrax officinalis) _which grows in the Levant, and in some\r\n  parts of Italy._\r\n\r\n  _This tree grows to the height of twenty feet and upwards: it is much\r\n  branched, and has broad, alternate, oval leaves, somewhat pointed, smooth\r\n  above, and downy beneath. The flowers are large, white, in clusters on\r\n  short footstalks, and terminate the branches._\r\n\r\nThe best storax is obtained from Asiatic Turkey, in small transparent\r\nmasses, of pale red or yellowish colour, and generally abounding in whitish\r\ntears, resembling those of benzoin. The drug, however, which is commonly\r\nsold in the shops as storax, consists of large, light pieces, very impure,\r\nfrom the saw-dust with which it is mixed.\r\n\r\nThe mode of obtaining this balsam is similar to that employed for benzoin\r\n(140): incisions are made in the trees, and, on its oozing from the wound,\r\nit is scraped off, and collected together to be packed for sale. It was\r\nformerly customary to enclose it in reeds.\r\n\r\nStorax is one of the most fragrant of the balsams, and is much used in some\r\ncountries in perfumes, and for fumigation. It is also compounded in various\r\nways with other substances, for medicinal use.\r\n\r\n  142. _LOG-WOOD is a dark red wood, chiefly used in dyeing; and imported\r\n  from Honduras, and some of the islands of the West Indies._\r\n\r\n  _The log-wood tree_ (Hæmatoxylon campechianum, Fig. 43) _is from sixteen\r\n  to twenty-four feet high, and, both in the trunk and branches, is\r\n  extremely crooked. The branches are spinous, and the leaves winged, with,\r\n  in general, four or five pair of leaflets, which are somewhat\r\n  heart-shaped. The flowers are if a reddish yellow colour, small, and\r\n  numerous._\r\n\r\nThe district of Honduras in North America has long been celebrated for the\r\nproduction of log-wood, which grows wild chiefly in forests where the soil\r\nis moist, or near the banks of rivers and lakes. The cutting of it occupies\r\na great number of hands, and is an unpleasant and very unhealthy pursuit.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1715 some seeds of the log-wood tree were introduced into the\r\nisland of Jamaica; and this wood is now chiefly employed in that island as\r\na fence against cattle. As an article of commercial export, it does not\r\nappear to answer so fully as could have been wished; yet, in morassy parts\r\nof the island, it grows in considerable luxuriance.\r\n\r\nFew kinds of wood are of more solid texture than this. Hence arises its\r\nweight, which is so great that it will sink in water. Its predominant\r\ncolour is red, tinged with orange and black; and its hardness such that it\r\nis capable of being polished, and is scarcely susceptible of decay. For\r\nexportation to Europe, it is cut into billets or logs, each about three\r\nfeet in length.\r\n\r\nThe chief use of log-wood in this country is for dyeing green, purple,\r\nblue, and black colours, according to the different ingredients with which\r\nit is employed. It gives a purplish tinge to watery and spirituous\r\ninfusions; but all the colours which can be prepared from it are fugitive,\r\nand cannot, by any art, be rendered so durable as those prepared from other\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nIndependently of its use as a dyeing drug, log-wood possesses considerable\r\nutility as an astringent medicine, chiefly under the form of a decoction,\r\nor of an extract boiled down to a proper consistence.\r\n\r\nThe price of logwood at Honduras is so low as not usually to exceed 12_l._\r\nor 14_l._ Jamaica currency per ton.\r\n\r\n  143. _MAHOGANY is the wood of a well-known tree_ (Swietenia mahagoni,\r\n  Fig. 44) _of large dimensions, with winged leaves, and small white\r\n  flowers, which grows in Jamaica and Honduras._\r\n\r\n  _The branches of this tree are numerous and spreading. Its leaves are\r\n  alternate and winged, with four or five pair of leaflets, which are\r\n  somewhat spear-shaped. The flowers are numerous, small, white, and in\r\n  spikes or clusters, which arise at the junction of the leaves with the\r\n  branches._\r\n\r\nThe cutting of mahogany constitutes a principal occupation of the British\r\nsettlers in the vicinity of Honduras. The gangs of negroes employed in this\r\nwork consist of from ten to fifty each, one of whom is styled the\r\n\"huntsman.\" He is generally selected from the most intelligent of his\r\ncompanions, and his chief employment is to search for these trees in the\r\nwoods, the principal of which lie adjacent to the river Balize. About the\r\nbeginning of August, the huntsman is despatched into the woods, and he cuts\r\nhis way through the thickest parts, to the highest spots he can find. Here\r\nhe climbs the loftiest tree, and thence attentively surveys the surrounding\r\nforest. At this season the leaves of the mahogany trees are of a yellow\r\nreddish hue, and an eye accustomed to them can discover, at a great\r\ndistance, the places where they are most abundant. He now descends, and to\r\nsuch places directs his steps; and, having well marked the way, returns to\r\nhis companions, to point out the places to them.\r\n\r\nHere they assemble, and erect, against each tree to be felled, a stage so\r\nhigh as to allow of the tree being cut down at the height of about twelve\r\nfeet from the ground. The last day of felling the trees is appropriated to\r\nfestivity; and these people have then a short interval of leisure for\r\ncomforts in which they seldom can indulge at any other time.\r\n\r\nAfter the branches are lopped, and the useless parts of the wood are cut\r\noff, the operation commences of conveying the trees, by cattle and trucks,\r\nto the water's side, a task of infinite and laborious difficulty. A\r\nsufficient number of pieces to form a raft being here collected, they are\r\nshoved from the bank into the water, and suffered to float singly upon the\r\ncurrent to large cables which are placed across the river at some distance\r\nbelow. As numerous gangs of mahogany cutters are usually employed near the\r\nbanks of the same river, their trees also float to the same spot. Here\r\ntherefore the whole are collected, amounting sometimes to more than a\r\nthousand immense logs; and, each party claiming his own, the trees are\r\nformed into separate rafts for their final destinations.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the profit of cutting mahogany at this settlement has\r\nbeen very great. A single tree has occasionally been known to contain\r\n12,000 superficial feet, and to have produced upwards of 1000_l._ sterling.\r\n\r\nThe body of the tree is of course the most valuable; but, for ornamental\r\npurposes, the limbs or large branches, are generally preferred, their grain\r\nbeing much closer, and their veins being more rich and variegated than\r\nthose of the other parts.\r\n\r\nThe Honduras mahogany is considered inferior to that produced in Jamaica.\r\nIn this island mahogany was formerly much more abundant, and consequently\r\nmuch less expensive than it is now, because the low lands have gradually\r\nbeen thinned of such trees as could readily be carried to market, or\r\nconveyed on board vessels for exportation.\r\n\r\nThe date of the introduction of mahogany wood into England is 1724. Since\r\nthis period it has been in very general request for making the more\r\nvaluable kinds of household furniture. It admits of a high polish, and is\r\nexcellently adapted for tables, chairs, desks, and other similar articles.\r\nIn Jamaica, mahogany is employed as a strong and durable timber for beams,\r\njoists, planks, boards, &c. Many attempts have been made to stain other\r\nkinds of wood so as to resemble it, but none of these have been attended\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\nIt has been lately discovered that the _bark_ of the mahogany tree may be\r\nadvantageously employed in medicine, as a substitute for Peruvian bark\r\n(62).\r\n\r\n  144. _QUASSIA is a drug, the root of a tree_ (Quassia amara, Fig. 78)\r\n  _which grows in the West Indies and South America, but particularly in\r\n  the colony of Surinam._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves of the quassia tree are winged, with two pair of oval and\r\n  somewhat pointed leaflets, and an odd one at the end: these are smooth,\r\n  deep green above and pale below; and the common footstalk is edged on\r\n  each side with a leafy membrane. The flowers are bright red, and\r\n  terminate the branches in long clusters._\r\n\r\nThis drug was first brought into use in Surinam, by a negro whose name was\r\nQuassia, and who employed it with great success in the cure of intermittent\r\nand other malignant fevers, which prevail in that flat and marshy country.\r\nThe offer of a valuable consideration induced him to reveal the secret to\r\nDaniel Rolander, a Swede, who carried specimens of the wood, together with\r\na branch of the tree, the flower, and fruit, to Stockholm, in 1756.\r\n\r\nSince this period the drug has been generally employed in Europe; and its\r\nefficacy in the removal of many diseases has been perfectly ascertained.\r\nDr. Cullen, however, observes, that though it is an excellent bitter, and\r\nthat it will do all that any pure or simple bitter can do, yet his\r\nexperience of it had not led him to think it would do more. Quassia is said\r\nto possess antiseptic properties, and consequently to have considerable\r\ninfluence in retarding a tendency to putrefaction. It is also sometimes\r\nused instead of hops in the brewing of malt liquor.\r\n\r\nThe _root_, _wood_, and _bark_ of the quassia tree are all occasionally\r\nemployed in medicine, and the bark is said to be more intensely bitter than\r\neither of the other two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XI.--DODECANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  145. _GAMBOGE is a yellow resinous gum obtained from a tree_ (Garcinia\r\n  cambogia) _which grows in several parts of Camboga or Camboya in the\r\n  empire of Tunkin._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves of this tree are oval, but acute. The flowers have each five\r\n  petals, and fifteen stamens: they are solitary, terminate the branches,\r\n  and have scarcely any stalks. The fruit is a berry about the size of an\r\n  orange._\r\n\r\nThe name of this gum has been derived from that of the country whence it is\r\nbrought. The mode of obtaining it is by puncturing or cutting the branches\r\nof the trees. It issues from the wounds in a fluid state, but soon becomes\r\nhardened by the heat of the sun. After this it is formed into large cakes\r\nor rolls, in which state we receive it.\r\n\r\nGamboge is chiefly used as a pigment. When good, it is of a fine orange\r\ncolour; and on being softened with water, is bright yellow, requiring no\r\npreparation previously to being used. It is also given as a medicine; but\r\nits operations being very violent, it should be administered with great\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nThe dried fruit of the gamboge tree is not unfrequently sent to our\r\ncolonies in the East Indies, where it is used in sauces, and with several\r\nkinds of food.\r\n\r\n  146. _WELD_ (Reseda luteola) _is a plant of the mignionette tribe, used\r\n  in dyeing: it grows wild, in barren and uncultivated places, particularly\r\n  on coal-pit banks, in several parts of England._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves are spear-shaped, and entire, with a tooth-like process on\r\n  each side of the base. The flowers are yellow, and in long spikes; and\r\n  the calyx is divided into four segments._\r\n\r\nIn some parts of England, particularly in the clothing counties, weld is\r\ncultivated to great extent; and it flourishes in sandy soils that could be\r\nturned to little advantage in any other way. When the plants are ripe, they\r\nare pulled up by the roots, dried, and tied into bundles for use.\r\n\r\nThe tinging quality of weld resides both in the stems and roots. This\r\nimparts to wool, cotton, mohair, and silk, a very bright and beautiful\r\nyellow colour; and blue cloths, dipped in a decoction of it, become green.\r\nThe yellow colour of the paint called _Dutch pink_ is obtained from this\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XII.--ICOSANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  147. _The GUAVA, or BAY PLUM, is a West Indian fruit, of which there are\r\n  two kinds, one white and round, and the other red and pear-shaped. The\r\n  former is produced by a tree_ (Psidium pomiferum) _which has\r\n  sharp-pointed and highly ribbed leaves, and flowers three on each stalk;\r\n  and the latter by a tree_ (Psidium pyriferum) _with oval leaves and\r\n  single-stalked flowers._\r\n\r\nEqually delicious and wholesome, these _fruits_ are in the highest\r\nestimation in the countries where they are produced. The rind or skin is\r\nlined with an apple-like substance, which is used for tarts and other sweet\r\npreparations. It is also stewed and eaten with milk; and, in this form, is\r\ngenerally thought better than any other stewed fruit; from the same part a\r\nmarmalade is made. This rind encloses an agreeable pulp, mixed with\r\ninnumerable small seeds. The whole fruit is eaten raw, or prepared as a\r\nsweetmeat in various ways; the most common form in which we see it is that\r\nof a jelly.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ is used for fuel, and also makes excellent charcoal.\r\n\r\n  148. _The COMMON MYRTLE_ (Myrtus communis) _is a well-known ornamental\r\n  evergreen shrub, which is cultivated chiefly in greenhouses in this\r\n  country, but grows wild in the countries of the South of Europe._\r\n\r\nAlthough this shrub is cultivated with us chiefly for ornament, it is of\r\nconsiderable utility to the inhabitants of the South of Europe. Its _young\r\nshoots_ are used for tanning leather; and both its _leaves_ and _berries_\r\nare employed in medicine. From the former a distilled water is obtained,\r\nwhich is sometimes used in gargles. The berries are likewise distilled; and\r\nan oil prepared from them has considerable repute as a means of thickening\r\nthe hair.\r\n\r\n  149. _ALL-SPICE, or PIMENTO, is the dried berry of a West Indian species\r\n  of myrtle_ (Myrtus pimenta, Fig. 45.)\r\n\r\n  _This tree grows to the height of twenty feet and upwards, and has\r\n  somewhat oval leaves about four inches long, of deep shining green\r\n  colour, and numerous bunches of white flowers, each with four small\r\n  petals._\r\n\r\nIn the whole vegetable creation there is scarcely any tree more beautiful\r\nor more fragrant than a young pimento about the month of July. Branched on\r\nall sides, richly clad with deep green leaves, which are relieved by an\r\nexuberance of white and strongly aromatic flowers, it attracts the notice\r\nof all who approach it.\r\n\r\nPimento trees grow spontaneously, and in great abundance, in many parts of\r\nJamaica; but they cannot be propagated without great difficulty. The usual\r\nmethod of making a new pimento walk, or plantation, is to appropriate for\r\nthis purpose a piece of woody ground in the neighbourhood of an already\r\nexisting walk, or in a part of the country where the scattered trees are\r\nfound in a native state. The other trees are cut down; and, in a year or\r\ntwo, young pimento plants are found to spring up in all parts, supposed to\r\nhave been produced from berries scattered there by birds, which eagerly\r\ndevour them.\r\n\r\nAbout the month of September, and not long after the blossoms have fallen,\r\nthe berries are in a fit state to be gathered. At this time, though not\r\nquite ripe, they are full grown, and about the size of pepper-corns.\r\n\r\nThey are gathered by the hand; and one labourer on a tree will strip them\r\noff so quickly as to employ three below in picking them up; and an\r\nindustrious picker will fill a bag of seventy pounds' weight in a day. The\r\nberries are then spread on a terrace, in the sun, for about seven days, to\r\nbe dried; but this is an operation which requires great care, from the\r\nnecessity of keeping them perfectly free from moisture. By the drying they\r\nlose their green colour, and become reddish brown; and the process is known\r\nto be completed by their colour, and by the rattling of the seeds within\r\nthe berries. They are then packed into bags or hogsheads for the market.\r\nWhen the berries are quite ripe, they are of a dark purple colour, and\r\nfilled with a sweet pulp.\r\n\r\nPimento is thought to resemble in flavour a mixture of cinnamon, nutmegs,\r\nand cloves, whence it has obtained the name of \"all-spice.\" It is much\r\nemployed in cookery; and is chiefly used in whole grains. It is also\r\nemployed in medicine, as an agreeable aromatic; and forms the basis of a\r\ndistilled water, a spirit, and an essential oil. The _leaves_ of the\r\npimento trees yield in distillation an odoriferous oil, which is not\r\nunfrequently used in medicinal preparations, instead of oil of cloves.\r\n\r\n  150. _The PEACH is a large, downy, and well-known garden fruit_\r\n  (Amygdalus Persica), _which is supposed to have been originally\r\n  introduced into Europe from Persia, and was first brought into England\r\n  about the year 1562._\r\n\r\nThis rich and delicious fruit is highly and deservedly esteemed at table,\r\nas an article in our desserts; and, when ripe and fresh, is grateful and\r\nwholesome, seldom disagreeing with the stomach, unless this organ be not in\r\nan healthy state, or the fruit be eaten to excess. When preserved in wine,\r\nbrandy, or sugar, it loses its good properties. The _kernels_ yield a\r\nsalubrious bitter. The _flowers_, which are very beautiful, and appear\r\nearly in the spring, emit an agreeable odour, have a bitterish taste, and\r\nare used for medical purposes. The _leaves_ are occasionally employed in\r\ncookery, but they ought not to be used without great caution, on account of\r\ntheir injurious properties.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of the peach, some of which are much more esteemed\r\nthan others. The mode in which the trees are usually propagated is by a\r\nprocess termed budding, or grafting upon the stock of some other tree (see\r\np. 147); and, by this process, those of any favourite kind may be exactly\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n151. The NECTARINE is a smooth-skinned variety of the peach, but of richer\r\nand more delicious flavour. The culture and management of the two kinds are\r\nexactly the same; and in all the circumstances of their growth, wood,\r\nleaves, and flowers, they precisely resemble each other.\r\n\r\n  152. _The COMMON or SWEET ALMOND is a soft and pleasant-flavoured kernel,\r\n  contained in a nut which is of flattish shape, and has a tender shell\r\n  with numerous small holes on the outside._\r\n\r\n  _The almond tree_ (Amygdalus communis, Fig. 46) _is usually twelve or\r\n  fourteen feet high. Its beautiful pink flowers of five petals grow in\r\n  pairs, and appear early in the spring. The leaves are somewhat oval,\r\n  pointed, and delicately serrated at the edges._\r\n\r\nOur shrubberies contain no tree the flowers of which are more beautiful\r\nthan those of the almond; and these flowers appear in March and April, a\r\nseason when few other parts of the vegetable creation have recovered from\r\ntheir wintry state. Though known to the ancients from the most remote\r\nperiods of antiquity, the almond tree has only been cultivated in England\r\nsince the year 1562, and this almost wholly on account of the elegant\r\nappearance of its flowers; as the climate of Great Britain is not\r\nsufficiently warm for the fruit to be perfected with us.\r\n\r\nThe almonds that are consumed in this country are imported, sometimes in\r\nthe shell, but much more commonly without, from France, Spain, Italy, and\r\nthe Levant; and they are packed in casks, boxes, and bales. The province of\r\nValencia had formerly great celebrity for its almonds; but the cultivation\r\nof the trees in that part of Spain has for several years been much\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThe chief uses of sweet almonds are in confectionary and cooking. They are\r\nalso eaten with raisins in desserts after dinner; but they should be well\r\nchewed, as every piece that is swallowed entire is indigestible. By\r\npressure, they yield a considerable proportion, sometimes nearly half their\r\nweight, of _oil_. Indeed this is so plentiful that it may even be squeezed\r\nout of the kernel with the fingers. Some preparations of almonds are used\r\nin medicine, particularly that called _milk of almonds_, which is formed of\r\npounded almonds, loaf-sugar, and water, well mixed together. In some parts\r\nof the East Indies, it is said that almonds supply the place of small\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n  153. _BITTER ALMONDS are in no respect different from sweet almonds,\r\n  either as to the appearance of the kernels themselves, or the trees which\r\n  produce them, except somewhat in the size of the flowers and fruit._\r\n\r\nLike sweet almonds, they yield a large portion of _oil_. This has no\r\nbitterness; but the substance which remains after the pressure is intensely\r\nbitter. If these almonds be eaten freely, they occasion sickness and\r\nvomiting; and, to many quadrupeds and birds, they are a fatal poison. There\r\nwas formerly a notion, but it is an erroneous one, that the eating of them\r\nwould prevent the intoxicating effects of wine. They are frequently used,\r\ninstead of apricot kernels, in ratafia, and sometimes are employed in\r\nmaking a counterfeit cherry-brandy. The oil and emulsions of bitter almonds\r\nare used in medicine: and a powder and paste, for washing the hands is made\r\nboth from them and from sweet almonds. By confectioners they are much in\r\nrequest for flavouring biscuits and other articles.\r\n\r\n  154. _The POMEGRANATE is an apple-shaped fruit with thick rind, and\r\n  crowned with the leaves or teeth of the calyx. It is the produce of an\r\n  evergreen shrub_ (Punica granatum, Fig. 47) _which grows wild in the\r\n  southern parts of Europe._\r\n\r\n  _This shrub is usually from fifteen to twenty feet high. The branches are\r\n  armed with spines; and the leaves are oblong, pointed, and dark green.\r\n  The flowers, which are of a rich scarlet colour, have five rounded\r\n  petals._\r\n\r\nBy the Greeks and Romans almost every part of the pomegranate tree (the\r\nroot, leaves, flowers, and fruit) was considered to possess medical\r\nproperties of a very remarkable and even marvellous description; and the\r\ncountry then chiefly celebrated for the production of it was that adjacent\r\nto the city of Carthage. The pomegranate is now, however, in little esteem,\r\nexcept on account of its fruit; the pulp or juice of which is pleasant to\r\nthe palate, and, in common with other summer fruits, allays heat and\r\nmitigates thirst, but has a slightly astringent flavour. This pulp is red,\r\nis contained in transparent membranes, and included in nine distinct cells.\r\nThe tough _rind_ of the fruit, which is of a bitter and astringent nature,\r\nwas employed by the ancients in the dressing of leather; and it is still\r\nused in some parts of Germany, together with the _bark_ of the tree, in the\r\npreparation and dyeing of red leather in imitation of what is called\r\nMorocco leather.\r\n\r\nPomegranates were first cultivated in England about the year 1596; but the\r\nfruit grown in this country seldom attains a delicacy of flavour equal to\r\nthat which is imported from Spain, Italy, and other warm climates.\r\n\r\n  155. _The CHERRY is a fruit of the prune or plum tribe, the original\r\n  stock of which is the wild cherry_ (Prunus cerasus) _of our woods._\r\n\r\nThe gradual effects of cultivation, as they regard the cherry, have been\r\nthe production of several kinds, which, both in size and flavour,\r\ninfinitely exceed the fruit of the parent stock, or wild cherry of the\r\nwoods. The kinds that are best known are the _May Duke, Early Kentish\r\nCherry, White Heart, and Black Heart Cherries_. The trees are propagated by\r\ngrafting (see p. 147) them usually upon the stocks of wild black and red\r\ncherry trees, which are reared for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThis agreeable _fruit_ is eaten either fresh or dried. It is sometimes\r\npreserved with sugar as a sweetmeat; is made into jam; used in preparations\r\nof the liqueur called cherry-brandy: and made into wine. From wild black\r\ncherries the Swiss distil an ardent spirit, by the sale of which to the\r\nFrench and Germans they derive considerable profit.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the cherry-tree, which is hard and tough, is much used,\r\nparticularly by turners and cabinet-makers on the Continent, for the\r\nmanufacture of chairs and other furniture. The _gum_ that exudes from the\r\nbark is, in many respects, equal to gum arabic (273); and is considered\r\nvery nutritive. Hasselquist informs us that, during a siege, more than 100\r\nmen were kept alive for nearly two months, without any other sustenance\r\nthan a little of this gum, which they occasionally took into their mouths\r\nand suffered gradually to dissolve.\r\n\r\n  156. _The APRICOT_ (Prunus Armeniaca) _is a fruit of the plum tribe,\r\n  which grows wild in several parts of Armenia and was first introduced\r\n  into this country about the middle of the sixteenth century._\r\n\r\nSome persons are inclined to consider the apricot as the most delicate of\r\nall our hardy fruits. For pastry certainly none is more excellent. It is\r\nused for tarts, both green and when ripe; it is also preserved with sugar\r\nin both these states, and is sometimes dried as a sweetmeat. Care, however,\r\nshould be taken to gather it before it becomes soft and mealy. The\r\n_kernels_ of apricots have a pleasantly bitter flavour, and answer much\r\nbetter for several purposes in confectionary than bitter almonds, which are\r\nusually applied. They likewise contain a sweet oil, which, like that of\r\nalmonds, was formerly used in emulsions.\r\n\r\nThe _gum_ that issues from the apricot tree is nearly similar to that of\r\nthe cherry (152). The _wood_ is coarse-grained and soft, and consequently\r\nis seldom used in carpentry.\r\n\r\nApricot trees are chiefly grown against walls, and are propagated by\r\ngrafting upon plum-tree stocks.\r\n\r\n  157. _The COMMON or DOMESTIC PLUM, in all its varieties, has been derived\r\n  from a wild species of plum-tree_ (Prunus domestica), _which grows in\r\n  hedge-rows and thickets in several parts of England; and is distinguished\r\n  by its branches being without thorns, and its fruit-stalks being single._\r\n\r\nWere it not a well-established fact, few persons would suppose that the\r\n_magnum bonum_, or _egg plum_, the _green gage_, and several others, which\r\nare now common in our gardens, are indebted, for their parent stock, to the\r\nwild plum above-mentioned. These are all used at table; and, when\r\nsufficiently ripe, and eaten in moderate quantity, are pleasant and\r\nwholesome fruits, but, in an immature state, they are very unwholesome.\r\n\r\n_Prunes_ and _French plums_ are the dried fruit of different kinds of\r\nplum-trees. They are usually packed in boxes, and are imported from the\r\nContinent, but particularly from the neighbourhood of\r\nMarseilles.--Brignolles, a town of Provence, about thirty miles from\r\nMarseilles, is one of the most famous places in France for dried prunes.\r\n_Prunes_ or _St. Catherine's plums_, constitute a lucrative branch of\r\ntraffic, which is almost exclusively carried on in Tours and Chatelherault.\r\nPrunes are sometimes employed in medicine, but French plums are chiefly\r\nused at table.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the plum-tree is of little value; but the _bark_ is in\r\noccasional request as affording a yellow dye.\r\n\r\n  158. _The BULLACE PLUM is a small violet-coloured fruit of globular\r\n  shape, produced by a shrub_ (Prunus insititia) _which grows wild in our\r\n  hedges, and is known by its branches being thorny, and its fruit-stalks\r\n  in pairs._\r\n\r\nThe plum has a rough, but not unpleasantly acid taste, especially after it\r\nhas been mellowed by the frost. A conserve, called _bullace cheese_, is\r\nsometimes prepared by mixture of the pulp of the bullace with about thrice\r\nits weight of sugar. In several parts of Germany this fruit is preserved in\r\nvinegar and spice; and is occasionally used, in the manner of cherries, for\r\nthe flavouring of brandy. An infusion of the _flowers_, sweetened with\r\nsugar, is sometimes used medicinally for children. The _wood_ is pleasingly\r\nveined, and is much valued by turners.\r\n\r\n  159. _The SLOE is a small, round, and nearly black kind of plum_ (Prunus\r\n  spinosa), _of extremely austere taste, which is common in thickets and\r\n  hedges throughout nearly every part of England._\r\n\r\n  _The shrub that produces it has thorny branches, and the fruit-stalks are\r\n  single._\r\n\r\nThe harshness and austerity of the sloe are proverbial. Its _juice_, if\r\nmixed with British made wines, communicates to them a red colour, and an\r\nastringent flavour, somewhat resembling that of port wine; a fact too well\r\nknown to some of the dealers in that favourite liquor. The juice of unripe\r\nsloes, dried over a gentle fire, so nearly resembles the Egyptian acacia\r\n(273), that it has in many instances been substituted for that substance;\r\nit is, however, harder, heavier, of darker colour, and somewhat sharper\r\ntaste than the genuine kind. A conserve of this fruit, made with three\r\ntimes its weight of double-refined sugar, has been used with success as a\r\ngargle for sore throats.\r\n\r\nAn infusion of the _flowers_ in water, or the flowers boiled in milk, are\r\nsometimes employed medicinally; and the _bark_, reduced to powder, has been\r\nefficaciously administered in agues. If boiled in ley, the bark yields a\r\nred dye. The young and tender _leaves_ of the sloe afford a substitute for\r\ntea, but some persons consider them unwholesome. The juice of the fruit,\r\nmixed with green vitriol, becomes an indelible black fluid, either for\r\ndyeing linen, or as writing-ink. The _wood_, being extremely tough, is\r\nconverted into walking-sticks, and made into the teeth of rakes; it is also\r\nsometimes used by turners. Dr. Withering has remarked, that, from certain\r\neffects which he observed to follow the prick of the _thorns_ of the sloe,\r\nhe was inclined to consider they had some poisonous quality, especially in\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENTAGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  160. _The MEDLAR_ (Mespilus germanica) _is usually considered a native\r\n  English fruit, having been remarked, more than a century ago, to grow\r\n  wild in hedges about Minshull in Cheshire. It is distinguished by being\r\n  depressed and concave at the top, the leaves of the calyx continuing upon\r\n  it; and by its containing several hard, compressed, and angular nuts._\r\n\r\nIt is the property of the medlar, which is cultivated in most large\r\ngardens, to be hard, and remarkably austere and disagreeable to the taste,\r\nuntil it has, in part, undergone the putrefactive fermentation, when it\r\nbecomes a soft, mellow, and, to many palates, a pleasant fruit. Medlars are\r\nusually gathered from the trees about the end of October, or beginning of\r\nNovember. To facilitate their becoming fit for the table, they may be\r\nplaced in moist bran; but such as require to be kept for subsequent use\r\nshould be deposited on dry straw. In a fortnight or three weeks those in\r\nthe bran will be eatable, and the others will more gradually ripen. After\r\nthey are perfectly ripe, they, however, soon become mouldy and decay.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the medlar-tree somewhat resembles that of the pear-tree, but\r\nis of no great value.\r\n\r\n  161. _The COMMON PEAR is a well-known garden fruit, derived from an\r\n  English stock, the wild pear-tree_ (Pyrus communis), _which grows in\r\n  hedges and thickets in Somersetshire and Sussex._\r\n\r\nIt would be an endless task to describe the different known varieties of\r\nthe cultivated pear. Some of these are very large, and others extremely\r\nsmall; some have a rich and luscious flavour, and others, as the iron pear,\r\nare so hard and disagreeable to the taste, as to be absolutely unfit to\r\neat. Pears are chiefly used in desserts; and one or two of the kinds are\r\nstewed with sugar, baked, or preserved in syrup.\r\n\r\nThe fermented _juice_ of pears is called _perry_, and is prepared nearly in\r\nthe same manner as that of apples (162) is for cider. The greatest\r\nquantities of perry are made in Worcestershire and Herefordshire. The\r\n_Squash_, the _Oldfield_, and the _Barland perry_ are esteemed the best.\r\nMany of the dealers in Champaigne wine are said to use perry in the\r\nadulteration of it; and, indeed, really good perry is little inferior,\r\neither in flavour or quality, to Champaigne.\r\n\r\nOf the _wood_ of the pear-tree, which is light, smooth, compact, and of\r\nyellowish colour, carpenters' and joiners' tools are usually made, as well\r\nas the common kinds of flat rulers, and measuring scales. It is also used\r\nfor picture frames that are to be stained black. The _leaves_ impart a\r\nyellow dye, and are sometimes employed to communicate a green colour to\r\nblue cloth.\r\n\r\n  162. _The APPLE, in all its numerous varieties, has been derived from\r\n  the_ Crab-tree (Pyrus malus), _which grows wild in almost every thicket,\r\n  and in hedges of all parts of the kingdom._\r\n\r\nThe uses of apples are very extensive, and even the _crab-tree_ is not\r\nwithout its use. The _fruit_ is indeed small, and bad to the taste; but its\r\nfermented juice, which is called _verjuice_, is sometimes employed in\r\ncookery, occasionally in medicine, and frequently by wax-chandlers, for the\r\npurifying of wax. Dr. Withering conceives that, with a proper addition of\r\nsugar, a grateful liquor might be made from the juice of crabs, little\r\ninferior to hock. Hogs and deer are particularly partial to this fruit. The\r\n_wood_ is tolerably hard, and, when made into the cogs of wheels, acquires\r\na polish, and is very durable.\r\n\r\nApple-trees are all produced in an artificial manner, by a process termed\r\n_grafting_. This is performed by inserting young shoots of such trees as\r\nbear valuable fruit, on stocks that have been raised from the seeds of\r\ncrabs. Thus the shoot of an apple-tree, inserted into a crab stock,\r\noccasions the crab-tree, from that time, to produce apples of nearly the\r\nsame kind and quality with those of the tree from which the shoot was\r\ntaken. Other stocks might be used, but those of the crab are considered the\r\nbest. The same process is adopted in the propagation of nearly every kind\r\nof fruit-tree; since, by experience, it has been ascertained that such as\r\nare produced from seed all partake of the nature of wild fruits, and have\r\nlittle resemblance to the fruit from which they spring.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of apples, and the varieties are every day\r\nincreasing, through the attention that is paid, by different individuals,\r\nto the culture of this valuable fruit. Those best known as eating apples\r\nare the American apple called _Newtown pippin_, the _non-pareil_, _golden\r\npippin_, _ribstone pippin_, _golden rennet_, and _lemon pippin_; for the\r\nkitchen, the _codlin_ and _russet_; and for cider, the _golden pippin_,\r\n_coccagee_, and _red streak_. Of these the non-pareil and golden pippin,\r\nfrom some unaccountable causes, are beginning to fail; the trees of late\r\nproduction not affording fruit of excellence equal to what has formerly\r\nbeen produced in this country.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible in this place to enumerate all the uses of apples.\r\nThey are employed in culinary preparations of several kinds, particularly\r\nin puddings and pies: they are a constant article in desserts; and are\r\ndried, baked, and made into jelly and marmalade. But by far the most\r\nimportant application of them is for the making of _cider_. The mode in\r\nwhich this is done in Herefordshire is very simple. After the apples have\r\nbeen gathered, they are sorted according to their different degrees of\r\nripeness, and laid together, for a little while, to heat, by which those\r\nwhich are not perfectly ripe are greatly improved in flavour. The fruit is\r\nthen ground in a mill, till even the kernels and rind are well bruised. It\r\nis allowed to stand, for a day or two, exposed in a large open vessel;\r\nafter which it is pressed between several hair cloths. The liquor that\r\nissues from it is received into a vat, to be fermented; it is subsequently\r\nremoved into casks till it becomes fine; it is then racked off into other\r\nvessels, leaving the lees behind. As soon as the fermentation has ceased,\r\nthe casks are filled up with other cider, and the bung-holes are closed.\r\n\r\nCider is a more acid liquor than perry, and, generally speaking, is a\r\nwholesome and pleasant drink during the heats of summer; but the harsher\r\nkinds, or those which are prepared in leaden vessels, if freely drunk, are\r\nthe cause of colics and other painful complaints. By distillation from\r\ncider an ardent spirit may be obtained. This has an unpleasant flavour, of\r\nwhich, however, it may be deprived by a certain process with charcoal. By\r\nboiling the fresh juice of apples, and afterwards fermenting it, a _wine_\r\nmay be made, which, when three or four years old, is said to acquire both\r\nthe colour and flavour of Rhenish wine.\r\n\r\n  163. _The QUINCE is a somewhat pear-shaped fruit, which is supposed to\r\n  have been originally imported into this country from the island of\r\n  Crete._\r\n\r\n  _The quince-tree_ (Pyrus cydonia), _is low and bushy. Its leaves are\r\n  oval, entire, and whitish beneath. The flowers are large, of pale red or\r\n  white colour, and do not grow in bunches, but each on a separate stalk._\r\n\r\nThough quinces have an austere taste, and are not eatable when raw, they\r\nlose a considerable portion of their harshness if prepared in any manner by\r\nheat; and, when mixed with other fruit in cookery, they communicate a very\r\npleasant flavour. Hence it is that they are often mixed with apples in\r\npies. Quinces are also boiled and eaten with sugar; made into marmalade,\r\nand preserved in syrup either whole or in halves. The _juice_ of quinces,\r\nboiled with sugar, was formerly used as a medicine, but of late years it\r\nhas been nearly discontinued. A proportion of one quart of the juice, mixed\r\nwith a pound of sugar, and fermented, yields a delicious wine. On the\r\nContinent, a celebrated liqueur is prepared from this juice, in combination\r\nwith sugar and brandy. A mucilage of the _seeds_ is kept by apothecaries,\r\nand used in medicine, as more pleasant, but it is not so efficacious, as\r\nthat of the simple gums.\r\n\r\nQuince-trees grow wild on the banks of the Danube, but, with much less\r\nluxuriance than in a state of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  164. _The HUNDRED LEAVED, or COMMON GARDEN ROSE_ (Rosa centifolia), _is a\r\n  shrub too well known to need any description._\r\n\r\nThis, the queen of flowers, is one of the most elegant and fragrant of the\r\nvegetable productions. Its _petals_ yield, on distillation, a small portion\r\nof aromatic _oil_, together with a _water_ which possesses both the odour\r\nand taste of the flowers. This oil congeals in the common temperature of\r\nour atmosphere, and in that state is of white colour; but, when liquefied\r\nby heat, it appears yellow. So small, however, is the quantity that can be\r\nobtained, that an hundred pounds' weight of the flowers will scarcely yield\r\nhalf an ounce of oil. It is in much request as a perfume, under the name of\r\n_ottar_ or _essence of roses_; and, though chiefly manufactured in the East\r\nIndies, is seldom imported from thence for sale, but considerable\r\nquantities of it are brought from Turkey, at the price of from three to\r\nfour pounds per ounce, exclusive of the duty. That from the East Indies,\r\nwhen genuine, has been sold at a much more exorbitant rate than this; but\r\nit is not unfrequently adulterated with oil of sandal-wood (55). The fraud,\r\nhowever, is easily detected by those who are accustomed to the smell of the\r\nlatter, and also by the fluidity of the compound. The true ottar of roses\r\nis undoubtedly the most elegant perfume that is known.\r\n\r\nFrom the petals of this rose are also prepared a _conserve_ and _syrup_,\r\nwhich are used in medicine. The simple distilled _rose-water_ has little to\r\nrecommend it beyond its fragrance: it is occasionally used to impart an\r\nagreeable flavour to culinary preparations, and also to some kinds of\r\ncordials. It should be remarked that, although, from their fragrance, roses\r\nare much used for nosegays, their odour has sometimes produced very\r\nalarming symptoms in persons sitting or sleeping with such nosegays in\r\nconfined apartments.\r\n\r\n  165. _The WILD BRIER, or HEP-ROSE_ (Rosa canina), _is a common wild\r\n  flower in hedges, and is distinguished by having a somewhat egg-shaped\r\n  fruit, smooth flower-stalks, the prickles of the stem hooked, and the\r\n  leaves oval, pointed, smooth, and shining._\r\n\r\nWe possess no wild shrub more ornamental to the country, in its flowers,\r\nits foliage, or its fruit, than this; and its sweet and delicate scent,\r\nthough less powerful, is perhaps as grateful as that of any rose that is\r\nknown. The _flowers_, when distilled, afford a pleasant perfumed water. The\r\n_fruit_, or heps, contain an acid yet sweetish pulp, with a rough prickly\r\nmatter enclosing the seeds. Of the pulp, when carefully separated from this\r\nsubstance, and mixed with sugar, is prepared the _conserve of heps_ of the\r\nshops, which, though of little medicinal virtue itself, is used to give\r\nform to more active medicines. In the north of Europe, the fruit of the\r\nrose, with the addition of sugar, is sometimes employed in the preparation\r\nof domestic wines; and the pulp, in a dried state, affords a grateful\r\ningredient in sauces: but it is supposed that a still greater advantage\r\nmight be derived from the fruit by distillation. The _leaves_ of this, and\r\nindeed of every kind of rose, have been recommended as a substitute for\r\ntea. On the Continent they are employed in currying the finer kinds of\r\nleather.\r\n\r\nOn the branches of this tree a singular moss-like and prickly excrescence\r\nis frequently found. This, which is caused by an insect (_Cynips rosæ_),\r\nand forms the habitation of its offspring, was formerly in great medicinal\r\nrepute; but it is now seldom used.\r\n\r\n  166. _The RED OFFICINAL ROSE_ (Rosa gallica) _differs from the\r\n  hundred-leaved rose in having the leaf-stalks more rough and prickly. The\r\n  petals are of deep crimson colour, large, spreading, and not numerous._\r\n\r\nIn the period of its flowering, this rose, which is a native of the south\r\nof Europe, succeeds the common garden rose. It is used in several medicinal\r\npreparations. Of its _petals_, in conjunction with sugar, a conserve is\r\nmade, an infusion, and a syrup; and the dried _buds_, with water and honey,\r\nare made into what is called _honey of roses_.\r\n\r\n  167. _The RASPBERRY_ (Rubus idæus) _is a well-known garden fruit, which\r\n  grows wild in woods and thickets of several parts of England._\r\n\r\nTo most persons the flavour of the raspberry is peculiarly grateful; and\r\nits perfume very delightful. Raspberries are much used in cookery and\r\nconfectionary, as well as to eat in desserts. With sugar they are made into\r\njam and jelly, and also into cakes. The juice, mixed with a certain portion\r\nof sugar and of brandy, constitutes the liqueur called _raspberry-brandy_.\r\nThis juice is much in request for ice-creams, and is sometimes manufactured\r\ninto wine. A grateful syrup is obtained from raspberries, which is\r\noccasionally used in medicine. The _leaves_ are said to be a grateful food\r\nto kids.\r\n\r\nWhite raspberries are sweeter than the red ones.\r\n\r\n168. Our wild hedge fruit, called BLACKBERRIES (_Rubus fruticosus_), belong\r\nto the same tribe as the raspberry. These are much eaten by children, and\r\nsometimes, when taken in too great quantities, produce very violent\r\neffects, and have caused fever, delirium, and other unpleasant symptoms. In\r\nProvence blackberries are employed for the colouring of wine. A syrup and\r\njelly, and sometimes also wine, are prepared from them. The _twigs_ are\r\nsometimes used in dyeing a black colour. Silkworms are occasionally fed\r\nupon the _leaves_ of the blackberry.\r\n\r\n  169. _The STRAWBERRY_ (Fragaria vesca) _is a British wood fruit which has\r\n  been long cultivated in gardens._\r\n\r\nBy cultivation the strawberry has been greatly increased in size, but its\r\nflavour continues much the same as that of the wild fruit. The varieties of\r\nthe strawberry are very numerous.\r\n\r\nNone of our fruits are more wholesome than these, and, even when eaten in\r\nlarge quantities, they seldom disagree with the stomach. They abound in\r\njuice, have a grateful, cooling, somewhat acid taste, and a peculiarly\r\nfragrant smell; and are either eaten alone, or with sugar, milk, or wine. A\r\npalatable jam, wine, and vinegar, are prepared from strawberries. This\r\nfruit is sometimes preserved whole in syrup, and sometimes in wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XIII.--POLYANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  170. _CAPERS are the unopened flower-buds of a low shrub_ (Capparis\r\n  spinosa, Fig. 48), _which grows from the crevices of rocks and walls, and\r\n  among rubbish, in the southern parts of France, in Italy, and the\r\n  Levant._\r\n\r\n  _The stems of the caper bush are trailing, and two or three feet in\r\n  length. The leaves are alternate, of somewhat oval shape, veined, and of\r\n  bright green colour: and the flowers are large and beautiful, with four\r\n  petals, and white with a tinge of red._\r\n\r\nIn the south of France, the caper bush is as common as the bramble is with\r\nus. It grows wild upon the walls of Rome, Sienna, and Florence; and when\r\ntrained against a wall, it flourishes even in the neighbourhood of Paris:\r\nnotwithstanding which it is almost unknown in English gardens, where it\r\ncannot be made to flower without the aid of artificial heat. This shrub is\r\ncultivated on a large scale, between Marseilles and Toulon, and in many\r\nparts of Italy.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the summer it begins to flower, and the flowers\r\ncontinue successively to appear till the commencement of winter. The buds\r\nare picked, every morning, before the petals are expanded: and, as they are\r\ngathered, they are put into vinegar and salt. When a sufficient quantity is\r\ncollected, they are distributed, according to their size, into different\r\nvessels, again put into vinegar, and then packed up for sale and\r\nexportation. This pickle is much used in sauce for boiled mutton. To\r\npersons unaccustomed to it, the taste of capers is unpleasant; but, after a\r\nlittle while, the palate becomes reconciled to it.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the _root_ cut into slices, and dried in small rolls or quills\r\nlike cinnamon, is sometimes used in medicine in cases of obstruction of the\r\nliver.\r\n\r\nThe flower-buds of the marsh marygold (_Caltha palustris_), and of\r\nnasturtiums, are frequently pickled and eaten as a substitute for capers.\r\n\r\n  171. _The WHITE POPPY_ (Papaver somniferum) _is a naturalized English\r\n  plant, with smooth calyx and seed-vessels, and with leaves embracing the\r\n  stem, which grows wild in neglected gardens, and some corn-fields, and to\r\n  which we are indebted for two important medicines_, opium _and_ laudanum.\r\n\r\nAlthough the white poppy has long been naturalized in this country, it is\r\nsupposed that we were originally indebted for it to some of the northern\r\nparts of Asia. Throughout nearly the whole of that quarter of the world it\r\nis cultivated with great attention, on account of the _opium_ which is\r\nobtained from it. Opium is the dried juice of the seed-vessels, and is thus\r\nprocured:--After the petals have fallen off, and the seed-vessels are about\r\nhalf grown, the latter are wounded on one side, with an instrument having\r\nfour or five teeth, the gashes being made about an inch in length. A\r\nglutinous, milky fluid exudes from the wounds: this is carefully scraped\r\noff, on the ensuing day, by a person who, in similar manner, wounds the\r\nopposite side of the head; the juice issuing from which is afterwards\r\nsimilarly collected. The whole is then put into earthen vessels, where it\r\nis worked by the hand, in the open sunshine, until it attains sufficient\r\nconsistence to be formed into balls, cakes, or loaves; after which it is\r\ncovered over with poppy or tobacco leaves, and further dried, till it is in\r\na proper state for exportation.\r\n\r\n_Opium_ is of reddish brown colour, inclining to black; and has a strong\r\nand very peculiar smell. It is adulterated in various ways; by an extract\r\nof the plant, obtained by boiling; by a powder of the dried leaves and\r\nstalks, mixed with some kind of gum; by rice flour, and by other substances\r\nnot quite so agreeable as these.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of opium is so extensively pursued in the East Indies that\r\nnearly 600,000 pounds' weight of it are annually exported from the Ganges.\r\nBut there is no necessity for us to import, at a great expense from abroad,\r\nthat which might be advantageously prepared in our own country. It is true\r\nthat the seed-vessels of the white poppy do not attain so large size in\r\nthis as in warmer climates; but the opium procured from it is of\r\nsufficiently excellent quality. From the seed-vessels of a single plant\r\nmore than forty grains of this drug have been obtained; and, under very\r\ndisadvantageous circumstances of weather, upwards of twenty-one pounds'\r\nweight have been procured from plants grown upon five acres of land. It has\r\nbeen calculated that, in favourable seasons, the produce of a single acre\r\nought to be near fifty pounds. It is recommended that the seed be sown in\r\nautumn rather than in spring. When the seed-vessels have attained a\r\nsufficient state of maturity, they may be wounded, and the opium may be\r\ncollected by children from eight to twelve years of age. The only proper\r\ntime for collecting it is in the morning, and seven children and two men\r\nhave been able to collect 1½ pound in one morning, betwixt five and nine\r\no'clock. The best mode of reducing the opium to a proper consistence\r\nappears to be to spread it thinly in shallow dishes, and expose it, under\r\nglasses, to the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nWe possess few medicines so valuable as this. It is used as a powerful\r\nantidote, but chiefly as a remedy for procuring sleep and mitigating pain,\r\nwhich it does in a very remarkable manner. In the latter respects, however,\r\nit is too often abused; and, if taken in large doses, it proves a deadly\r\npoison. But so much are the effects of opium diminished by the habit of\r\ntaking it, that, although four grains have, in some instances, proved fatal\r\nto grown persons, fifty times that quantity have been taken daily by\r\nothers. The bad effects of too great a dose are best counteracted by making\r\nthe patient drink freely of acids and coffee, and not permitting him to\r\nyield to the desire of sleeping, with which he is oppressed. The habitual\r\nuse of opium, which is much indulged in by the Asiatics, is attended with\r\nthe same bad effects as the habit of drinking ardent spirits: it brings on\r\ntremors, palsy, stupidity, and general emaciation; and, when once acquired,\r\nit can scarcely ever be relinquished.\r\n\r\nPossessing the above properties, it is remarkable that opium, combined in a\r\ncertain proportion with vegetable acids, instead of inducing, will prevent\r\nsleep. In consequence of which it has often, though injuriously, been used\r\nby persons who are obliged to devote their nights to sedentary or active\r\npursuits. It is likewise deserving of remark, that the _seeds_ of the poppy\r\nhave none of the narcotic qualities of the opium. They are mild, sweet, and\r\nnutritive; and yield, by pressure, an oil little inferior to that of\r\nalmonds. So numerous are these seeds that more than 30,000 have been\r\ncounted from a single seed-vessel.\r\n\r\n_Laudanum_ is a liquid preparation from opium and spirit of wine; and is\r\nused for most of the same purposes to which opium is applied. Its effects,\r\nas a poison, may be counteracted in the same manner as those of opium.\r\n\r\n  172. _ARNATTO, or ANNOTTA, is a red dyeing drug, generally imported in\r\n  lumps wrapped up in leaves, and produced from the pulp of the\r\n  seed-vessels of a shrub_ (Bixa orellana) _which grows spontaneously in\r\n  the East and West Indies._\r\n\r\n  _This shrub is usually seven or eight feet high, and has heart-shaped and\r\n  pointed leaves. The flowers, which have each ten large peach-coloured\r\n  petals, appear in loose clusters at the ends of the branches, and produce\r\n  oblong and somewhat hairy pods._\r\n\r\nThe seed-vessels of the arnatto shrub are, in appearance, somewhat like\r\nthose of the chesnut (235). They each contain from thirty to forty seeds,\r\nenveloped in a kind of pulp (of red colour and unpleasant smell), which is\r\nnot much unlike the paint called red lead, when mixed with oil. In the West\r\nIndies the method of extracting the pulp, and preparing it for sale, is to\r\nboil it, and the seeds which are mixed with it, in clear water, until the\r\nlatter are perfectly extricated. They are then taken out, and the pulp is\r\nallowed to subside to the bottom of the water; this is drawn off, and the\r\nsediment is distributed into shallow vessels, and gradually dried in the\r\nshade until it is sufficiently hard to be worked into lumps or masses for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nArnatto, though made in the West Indies, is an object of no great\r\ncommercial importance; the demand for it not being sufficient to give much\r\nencouragement to its culture. It is now chiefly prepared by the Spaniards\r\nin South America, and for the purpose principally of mixing with chocolate,\r\nto which, in their opinion, it gives a pleasing colour and great medicinal\r\nvirtue, as well as an improved flavour. The chief consumption of arnatto in\r\nEngland depends upon painters and dyers; and it is supposed that _Scott's\r\nnankeen dye_ is nothing but arnatto dissolved in alkaline ley. This drug is\r\nsometimes used by the Dutch farmers to give a rich colour to butter; and\r\nthe double Gloucester and several other kinds of cheese are coloured with\r\nit. Poor people occasionally use it instead of saffron.\r\n\r\nIn countries where the arnatto shrubs are found, the _roots_ are employed\r\nby the inhabitants in broth; and they answer all the purposes of the pulp,\r\nthough in an inferior degree. The _bark_ is occasionally manufactured into\r\nropes; and pieces of the _wood_ are used by the Indians to procure fire by\r\nfriction.\r\n\r\n  173. _The LIME or LINDEN-TREE is a British forest tree_ (Tilia europæa),\r\n  _distinguished by its heart-shaped and serrated leaves of bright green\r\n  colour, and by its berries or seed-vessels, having each four cells and\r\n  one bud._\r\n\r\n  _The blossoms are whitish, in small clusters, and have a yellowish green\r\n  floral leaf nearly as long as the fruit-stalk, and attached to it for\r\n  about half its length._\r\n\r\nNo one can have passed a grove of lime-trees, in the month of July, without\r\nhaving been charmed with the perfume which, at this season, is emitted by\r\nthe _flowers_. They are a great resort of bees, and supply those insects\r\nwith materials for their best honey. Whether fresh or dried, they easily\r\nferment, and a fine flavoured spirit may be distilled from them. The _wood_\r\nis close-grained, though soft, light, and smooth. It is much used by\r\ncarvers and turners; and is in great request for the boards of\r\nleather-cutters. When properly burnt it makes an excellent charcoal for\r\ngunpowder, and for painters.\r\n\r\nIf the _bark_ be softened in water, the fibrous inner part may be\r\nseparated: of this the Russians manufacture fishing-nets, mats, shoes, and\r\nrustic garments; and ropes and other cordage, made from it, are stated to\r\nbe so remarkably strong and elastic, that, in this respect, they are\r\nsuperior to iron chains. In some countries the _leaves_ are dried as a\r\nwinter food for sheep and goats; and, from these and the bark, a smooth but\r\ncoarse brown paper may be manufactured. An inferior kind of sugar may be\r\nmade from the _sap_; and the _seeds_, by pressure, yield a sweet and\r\npleasant oil.\r\n\r\nThe lime is an eligible tree to form shady walks and clipped hedges: but\r\nits leaves fall very early in the autumn. In rich soils it attains a\r\nprodigious size; and instances have been mentioned of these trees having\r\nexisted during more than six centuries.\r\n\r\n  174. _TEA, both black and green, consists of the dried leaves of an\r\n  evergreen shrub_ (Thea bohea _and_ Thea viridis, _of Linneus_, Fig. 49),\r\n  _with indented and somewhat spear-shaped leaves and white flowers with\r\n  six petals or more, which is much cultivated in China._\r\n\r\n  _The tea shrub attains the height of five or six feet, and is much\r\n  branched. The leaves, when full grown, are about 1½ inch long, narrow,\r\n  tapering, and of dark glossy green colour, and firm texture. The flowers\r\n  are not much unlike those of the white wild rose, but smaller; and they\r\n  are succeeded by a fruit about the size of a sloe, which contains two or\r\n  three seeds._\r\n\r\nThe tea-tree flourishes, with great luxuriance, in valleys, on the sloping\r\nsides of mountains, and on the banks of rivers, in a southern exposure,\r\nbetwixt the thirtieth and forty-fifth degrees of north latitude. It is\r\nchiefly cultivated near Pekin, and around Canton, but it attains the\r\ngreatest perfection in the mild and temperate climate of Nankin.\r\n\r\nThe collecting of the leaves is conducted with great care: they are picked\r\nsingly, and, for the most part, at three different times of the year; about\r\nthe end of February, the beginning of April, and the end of May. The drying\r\nand preparation of them, for use, are processes too long to admit of minute\r\ndetail respecting them in this place. It may, however, be observed, that\r\nfor these purposes buildings are erected, which contain from five to ten,\r\nand some of them even twenty, small furnaces, each having, at the top, a\r\nlarge iron pan. There is also a long table covered with mats, on which the\r\nleaves are laid, and rolled by persons who sit round it. The iron pan being\r\nheated by a fire in the furnace beneath, a few pounds of the leaves are put\r\nupon it, and frequently turned and shifted. They are then thrown upon the\r\nmats to be rolled betwixt the palms of the hands: after which they are\r\ncooled as speedily as possible. That the moisture of the leaves may be\r\ncompletely dissipated, and their twisted form be better preserved, the\r\nabove process is repeated several times with the same leaves, but with less\r\nheat than at first. The tea, thus manufactured, is afterwards sorted,\r\naccording to its kind or goodness. Some of the young and tender leaves are\r\nnever rolled, but are merely immersed in hot water, and dried.\r\n\r\nHow long the use of tea has been known to the Chinese we are entirely\r\nignorant; but we are informed that an infusion of the dried leaves of the\r\ntea shrub is now their common drink. They pour boiling water over them, and\r\nleave them to infuse, as we do in Europe; but they drink the tea thus made\r\nwithout either milk or sugar. The inhabitants of Japan reduce the leaves to\r\na fine powder, which they dilute with water, until it acquires nearly the\r\nconsistence of soup. The tea equipage is placed before the company,\r\ntogether with a box in which the powdered tea is contained: the cups are\r\nfilled with warm water, and then as much of the powder is thrown into each\r\ncup as the point of a knife can contain, and it is stirred about until the\r\nliquor begins to foam, in which state it is presented to the company.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly imagined that black and green tea were the production of\r\ndifferent species of shrubs; but the Chinese all assert, that both are\r\nproduced from the same species, and that the sole difference which exists\r\nbetwixt them arises from the seasons when the leaves are gathered, and the\r\nmodes of curing them. The teas principally consumed in Europe are four\r\nkinds of black, and three of green.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Black Teas._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Bohea_, or _Voo-yee_, so called from the country in which it is\r\nproduced, is sometimes collected at four gatherings. As the leaves are\r\npicked, they are put into flat baskets, which are placed on shelves or\r\nplanks, in the air or sun, from morning till night; after which they are\r\nthrown, by small quantities at a time, into a flat cast-iron pan, which is\r\nmade very hot. They are twice stirred quick with the hand: then taken out,\r\nagain put into the baskets, and rubbed between men's hands to roll them.\r\nAfter this they undergo another roasting in larger quantities, over a\r\nslower fire: and are then sometimes put into baskets over a charcoal fire.\r\nWhen the tea is, at last, sufficiently dried, it is spread on a table; and\r\nthe leaves that are too large, and those that are unrolled, yellow, broken,\r\nor otherwise defective, are picked out, and the remainder is laid aside to\r\nbe packed.\r\n\r\nThe best bohea tea is a small blackish leaf, is dusty, smells somewhat like\r\nburnt hay, and has a rough and somewhat harsh taste. The average annual\r\nimportation of bohea into this country, in the ten years from 1791 to 1800,\r\nwas 3,310,135 pounds.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Congo_, or _Cong-foo_, derived from a word which implies much care\r\nor trouble, is a superior kind of bohea, less dusty, and with larger\r\nleaves. These are gathered with peculiar care, and there is some little\r\ndifference in the preparation of congo and bohea. The leaves of the latter,\r\nof souchong, hyson, and the fine single teas, are said to be beaten, with\r\nflat sticks or bamboos, after they have been withered by exposure to the\r\nsun or air, and have acquired toughness enough to keep them from breaking.\r\n\r\nOf congo the annual average quantity imported in the above years amounted\r\nto 9,564,202 pounds.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Souchong_, from a Chinese word which signifies small good thing, is\r\nmade from the leaves of trees three years old; and, where the soil is good,\r\neven of the leaves of older trees. Of true souchong very little is\r\nproduced; what is sold to Europeans for this is only the finest kind of\r\ncongo, and the congo usually purchased by them is but the best sort of\r\nbohea. Such is the delicacy of this tea that, upon a hill planted with\r\ntea-trees, there may only be a single tree, the leaves of which are good\r\nenough to be called souchong, and even of these, only the best and youngest\r\nare taken. The others make congos of different kinds, and bohea.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Pekoe_ is distinguished by having the small white flowers of the\r\ntree intermixed with it. This, which is chiefly consumed in Sweden and\r\nDenmark, is usually made from the tenderest leaves of trees three years\r\nold, gathered just after they have been in bloom, when the small leaves\r\nthat grow between the first two that have appeared, and which altogether\r\nmake a sprig, are white, and resemble young hair or down.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Green Teas._\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that green teas are indebted for their qualities and\r\ncolour to a process of drying them upon plates of copper. This is certainly\r\nincorrect. The leaves for green tea are gathered, and immediately roasted,\r\nor _tached_, as it is called, upon cast-iron plates, and then are very much\r\nrubbed betwixt men's hands, to roll them. They are afterwards spread out\r\nand separated, as the leaves in rolling are apt to adhere to each other:\r\nand are again placed over the fire, and made very dry. After this they are\r\npicked, cleansed from dust, several times tached or roasted, and finally\r\nput hot into the chests in which they are to be packed.\r\n\r\nThe principal kinds of green tea are singlo, hyson, and gunpowder.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Singlo_, or _Song-lo_, is so named from the place where it is\r\nchiefly cultivated. Of this tea there are three or more sorts; but the\r\nleaves of the best are large, fine, flat, and clean. It is gathered at two\r\nseasons, the first in April, and the second in June. As we see it, the leaf\r\nis flattish, and yields, on infusion, a pale amber-coloured liquor.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Hyson_, or _Hee-chun_, has its name from that of an Indian merchant\r\nwho first sold this tea to the Europeans. There are two gatherings of\r\nhyson. It should have a fine blooming appearance, be of a full-sized grain,\r\nvery dry, and so crisp that, with slight pressure, it will crumble to dust.\r\nWhen infused in water the leaf should appear open, clear, and smooth, and\r\nshould tinge the water a light green colour; the infusion ought to have an\r\naromatic smell, and a strong pungent taste.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Gunpowder_ tea is a superior kind of hyson, gathered and dried with\r\npeculiar care. This tea should be chosen in round grains, somewhat\r\nresembling small shot, with a beautiful bloom upon it which will not bear\r\nthe breath: it should have a greenish hue, and a fragrant pungent taste.\r\nGunpowder tea is sometimes adulterated; an inferior kind being dyed and\r\nglazed in such manner as to resemble it; but, on infusion, this is found in\r\nevery respect very inferior.\r\n\r\nTea, both black and green, is sometimes imported in balls from the weight\r\nof two ounces to the size of peas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dried leaves of the tea plant are a commodity which, a century and a\r\nhalf ago, were scarcely known as an article of trade. The earliest\r\nimportation of tea into Europe is said to have been by a Dutch merchant in\r\n1610; but the time of its first introduction into England has not been\r\ncorrectly ascertained. So scarce an article was it, for many years after\r\nthe above period, that, in 1666, twenty-two pounds and three quarters of\r\ntea, estimated at fifty shillings a pound, were presented, as a valuable\r\ngift, to King Charles the Second. The first importation of tea by the East\r\nIndia Company was in 1669, and this consisted only of two canisters,\r\nweighing 143lb. 8oz. So rapidly, however, has the consumption of this\r\narticle since increased, that, notwithstanding the immense distance from\r\nwhich it is brought, it now amounts to more than twenty millions of pounds'\r\nweight per annum. Such is, at present, the extent of the tea trade, that it\r\naffords constant employment for at least 50,000 tons of shipping, and 6,000\r\nseamen; and its importance to us is the greater since it has been the means\r\nof opening, in China, a market for the sale of woollen goods, one of the\r\nmost essential articles of our manufacture, to the amount of more than one\r\nmillion of pounds sterling per annum.\r\n\r\nIf good tea be taken in moderate quantity it is considered by medical men\r\nto be beneficial, by exhilarating the spirits and invigorating the system;\r\nbut, when taken too copiously, it is apt to occasion weakness, tremor, and\r\nother bad symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe tea plant may be propagated in the temperate climates of Europe, as\r\nwell as in the Indies; under the shelter of a south wall it will even\r\nflourish in our own gardens. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that the\r\nfresh leaves, if used for tea, produce giddiness and stupefaction; but\r\nthese noxious properties are capable of being dissipated by the process of\r\nroasting.\r\n\r\nIn some of the southern parts of England there are smugglers who have\r\nreduced to a regular process the management of the leaves of the ash, the\r\nsloe, and some other trees, for the adulteration of tea. The article thus\r\nprepared has the name of _smouch_, and is sometimes mixed in the proportion\r\nof about one-third, with the ordinary teas. The preparation of it, however,\r\nif discovered, is subject to very heavy penalties.\r\n\r\n  175. _CLOVES are the unexpanded flower-buds of an East Indian tree_\r\n  (Caryophyllus aromaticus, Fig. 50), _somewhat resembling the laurel in\r\n  its height, and in the shape of its leaves._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves are in pairs, oblong, large, spear-shaped, and of bright\r\n  green colour. The flowers grow in clusters, which terminate the branches,\r\n  and have the calyx divided into four small and pointed segments. The\r\n  petals are small, rounded, and of bluish colour; and the seed is an oval\r\n  berry._\r\n\r\nIn the Molucca islands, where the preparation of different spices was\r\nformerly carried on by the Dutch colonists to great extent, the culture of\r\nthe clove-tree was a very important pursuit. It has even been asserted\r\nthat, in order to secure a lucrative branch of commerce in this article to\r\nthemselves, they destroyed all the trees growing in other islands, and\r\nconfined the propagation of them to that of Ternate only. But it appears\r\nthat, in 1770 and 1772, both clove and nutmeg trees were transplanted from\r\nthe Moluccas into the islands of France and Bourbon; and, subsequently,\r\ninto some of the colonies of South America, where they have since been\r\ncultivated with great success.\r\n\r\nAt a certain season of the year the clove-tree produces a vast profusion of\r\nflowers. When these have attained the length of about half an inch, the\r\nfour points of the calyx being prominent, and having in the middle of them\r\nthe leaves of the petals folded over each other, and forming a small head\r\nabout the size of a pea, they are in a fit state to be gathered. This\r\noperation is performed betwixt the months of October and February, partly\r\nby the hand, partly by hooks, and partly by beating the trees with bamboos.\r\nThe cloves are either received on cloths spread beneath the trees, or are\r\nsuffered to fall on the ground, the herbage having previously been cut and\r\nswept for that purpose. They are subsequently dried by exposure for a while\r\nto the smoke of wood fires, and afterwards to the rays of the sun. When\r\nfirst gathered they are of reddish colour, but, by drying, they assume a\r\ndeep brown cast.\r\n\r\nThis spice yields a very fragrant odour, and a bitterish, pungent, and warm\r\ntaste. It is sometimes employed as a hot and stimulating medicine, but is\r\nmore frequently used in culinary preparations. When fresh gathered, cloves\r\nwill yield on pressure a fragrant, thick, and reddish oil; and, by\r\ndistillation, a limpid essential oil. The latter is imported into Europe,\r\nbut is frequently adulterated, and sometimes even to the amount of nearly\r\nhalf its weight. Oil of cloves is used by many persons, though very\r\nimproperly, for curing the tooth-ache, since, from its pungent quality, it\r\nis apt to corrode the gums, and injure the adjacent teeth. When the tooth\r\nis carious, and will admit of it, a bruised clove is much to be preferred.\r\n\r\n  176. _LADANUM, or LABDANUM, is a resinous drug which exudes, and is\r\n  collected, from the leaves and branches of a beautiful species of cistus_\r\n  (Cistus Creticus), _which grows in Syria and the Grecian islands._\r\n\r\n  _The height of this shrub seldom exceeds three or four feet. Its leaves,\r\n  which stand in pairs on short foot-stalks, are oblong, wrinkled, rough,\r\n  and clammy. The flowers appear in June and July, and consist of five\r\n  large rounded petals of light purplish colour, each marked with a dark\r\n  spot at the base._\r\n\r\nThe ancient mode of collecting ladanum, if the accounts which have been\r\nstated respecting it may be credited, was not a little curious. Goats,\r\nwhich delight in grazing upon the leaves and young branches of the shrubs\r\nthat produce it, were turned loose into the plantation, and the resin that\r\nadhered to the long hair of their beards and thighs was afterwards detached\r\nby combing them.\r\n\r\nThe present method is different, and is a laborious and troublesome\r\nemployment. Tournefort informs us that he saw seven or eight country\r\nfellows, in their shirts and drawers, and in the hottest part of the day,\r\ndrawing over the shrubs a kind of whip, or rake, with numerous long straps\r\nor thongs of leather. From these they collected the resin, by scraping it\r\noff with a kind of knife; after which it was made into cakes of different\r\nsizes for sale. As loose sand generally adheres, in considerable quantity,\r\nto the viscous leaves of the shrub, it is not unusual for dealers in this\r\ndrug to adulterate it with sand.\r\n\r\nWe import ladanum principally from the Levant and the Persian Gulf; and it\r\ncomes to us in cakes or masses of different size, dark colour, and about\r\nthe consistence of soft plaster; and also in rolls, lighter-coloured and\r\nmuch harder, which are twisted up so as somewhat to resemble the rolls of\r\nwax tapers.\r\n\r\nThe smell of ladanum is strong, but not disagreeable; and its taste is\r\nwarm, aromatic, and somewhat unpleasant. This drug was formerly much used\r\nas an internal medicine; but it is now employed only externally, as an\r\ningredient in plasters.\r\n\r\n  177. _The TULIP-TREE_ (Liriodendron tulipifera) _is an American\r\n  production which yields a very beautiful and valuable kind of wood._\r\n\r\n  _It sometimes grows to the height of sixty or seventy feet; and has lobed\r\n  leaves, and tulip-shaped flowers._\r\n\r\nWhile young, the _wood_ of the tulip-tree is white; but at an advanced age,\r\nit assumes a fine yellow colour, or a streaked appearance of different\r\nshades of red. This wood is equally useful in ornamental furniture, and as\r\na timber for building. It is occasionally employed in the construction of\r\nlight vessels; and the trunks of tulip-trees are frequently hollowed by the\r\nIndians into canoes. When they have been grown in a favourable soil and\r\nclimate, one of them is sufficiently large to be made into a canoe capable\r\nof containing several people.\r\n\r\nOn account of its quick growth and easy culture, this noble tree well\r\ndeserves the attention of planters in our own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XIV.--DIDYNAMIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nGYMNOSPERMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  178. _LAVENDER is a well-known perennial garden plant_ (Lavandula spica)\r\n  _which grows wild in the south of Europe, and the flowers of which yield\r\n  a grateful perfume._\r\n\r\nSuch is the fragrance of this delightful flower, and so easy is its\r\nculture, that we can now scarcely enter a garden in which it is not found.\r\nIt will grow in almost any soil, but it flourishes most luxuriantly in\r\nclayey ground; and in situations whence, without inconvenience, it can be\r\nconveyed to the metropolis, it is a very valuable crop.\r\n\r\nWhen cultivated to any extent, lavender should be planted in rows two or\r\nthree feet apart, and the sets should be about two feet from each other. It\r\nis usually propagated from slips. During dry weather, in the month of July,\r\nthe flowers should be gathered, by cutting off the heads close to the stem;\r\nafter which they must be tied in bundles to be distilled.\r\n\r\nWhen distilled with water, the _flowers_ of lavender, if in a mature state,\r\nyield an essential _oil_; generally in the proportion of about one ounce of\r\noil to sixty ounces of flowers. This oil is of a bright yellow colour, and\r\npossesses the perfect fragrance of the lavender. But, if distilled with\r\nrectified spirit, the virtues are more completely extracted. From the\r\nleaves a very small proportion of oil can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe preparations of this plant that are used in medicine are, the essential\r\noil, a simple _spirit_, and a compound tincture. Lavender, however, is much\r\nmore frequently and more extensively employed as a perfume than\r\nmedicinally. The flowers are deposited in chests and wardrobes among linen,\r\nnot only on account of their fragrant smell, but also from an opinion that\r\ntheir odour will prevent the depredations of moths and other insects. The\r\nperfume called _lavender water_ may be prepared by mixing three drachms of\r\noil of lavender, and one drachm of essence of ambergris, with one pint of\r\nspirit of wine.\r\n\r\nLavender is supposed to have been first cultivated in England about the\r\nyear 1558.\r\n\r\n  179. _COMMON or SPEAR-MINT_ (Mentha viridis), _one of our most frequent\r\n  garden herbs, is a native British plant, and grows wild in watery places,\r\n  and near the banks of rivers, in several parts of England._\r\n\r\nThe ancients ascribed many virtues to different kinds of mint, but it is\r\nnot now possible to ascertain correctly the respective species, though\r\nthere can be little doubt that spear-mint was one of the most important of\r\nthem. Its flavour is to many persons peculiarly agreeable, and, on this\r\naccount, it is employed for several culinary purposes, both in a green and\r\ndried state.\r\n\r\nThe _leaves_ are used in spring salads, are boiled with peas, and put into\r\nsoup. In conjunction with vinegar and sugar they form a sauce for lamb; and\r\nprepared with sugar, they are made into a grateful conserve. Spear-mint is\r\noccasionally used in medicine, and the officinal preparations of it are the\r\nconserve, an essential oil, a simple distilled water, a spirit, and a\r\ntincture, or extract. In drying, the leaves lose about three-fourths of\r\ntheir weight, but without suffering much either in taste or smell.\r\n\r\n  180. _PEPPER MINT_ (Mentha piperita) _is a British plant, which grows in\r\n  watery places, and is cultivated chiefly on account of an oil and\r\n  distilled water which are prepared from it._\r\n\r\nThis is the strongest and most aromatic of all the mints; and, on this\r\naccount, is more used in medicine than any other species. When distilled\r\nwith water it yields a considerable quantity of essential oil, of pale\r\ngreenish yellow colour. The well-known liquor called _pepper mint water_,\r\nprepared from this plant, is an excellent stomachic: but is too often used\r\nin cases of impaired appetite, and for the relief of various imaginary\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGIOSPERMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  181. _The FOX-GLOVE_ (Digitalis purpurea) _is a stately British plant,\r\n  with long, erect spikes of large, purple, and somewhat bell-shaped\r\n  flowers, marked internally with dark spots in whitish rings, and\r\n  containing four stamens, with large yellow anthers._\r\n\r\n  _The calyx, or flower-cup, has five pointed divisions. The extremity of\r\n  the blossom is divided into five segments; and the seed-vessel is\r\n  egg-shaped, and contains many seeds. The leaves are large, wrinkled, and\r\n  somewhat downy beneath._\r\n\r\nThe gravelly or sandy hedge-banks or hills of all the midland counties of\r\nEngland are adorned, in the later months of summer, with this, one of the\r\nmost beautiful, most dangerous, and yet, if properly applied, one of the\r\nmost useful of all our wild plants. For its medicinal virtues it has long\r\nbeen esteemed. The Italians have an adage which implies that \"the fox-glove\r\nheals all sores:\" hence it is said, that they apply the bruised leaves, and\r\nthe juice of the leaves, in the healing of different kinds of wounds, and\r\nparticularly for the removal of scrophulous swellings.\r\n\r\nThe _juice_ of this plant has a bitter and nauseous taste; and, when taken\r\ninternally, acts violently on the stomach and bowels, and brings on stupor\r\nand drowsiness; notwithstanding which, in careful hands, it may be rendered\r\na valuable medicine in dropsy, consumption, and epilepsy. It is given in\r\npowder, tincture, and infusion of the dried leaves; and such is its\r\nstrength, that Dr. Woodville states, the dose of the dried leaves, in\r\npowder, should not exceed from one to three grains per day.\r\n\r\n  182. _The CALABASH-TREE_ (Crescentia cujeta) _is a production of the West\r\n  Indies and America, about the height and dimensions if an apple-tree,\r\n  with crooked horizontal branches, wedge-shaped leaves, pale white flowers\r\n  on the trunk and branches, and a roundish fruit, from two inches to a\r\n  foot in diameter._\r\n\r\nThe uses to which the _fruit_ of the calabash tree is applied are very\r\nnumerous. Being covered with a greenish yellow skin, which encloses a thin,\r\nhard, and almost woody shell, it is employed for various kinds of domestic\r\nvessels, such as water cans, goblets, and cups of almost every shape and\r\ndescription. So hard and close-grained is the calabash, that, when it\r\ncontains any kind of fluid, it may even be put on the fire without injury.\r\nWhen intended for ornamental purposes, the vessels that are made of the\r\nshell of this fruit are sometimes highly polished, and have figures\r\nengraven upon them, which are variously tinged with indigo and other\r\ncolours. The Indians make musical instruments with the calabash.\r\n\r\nThe calabash contains a pale, yellow, juicy _pulp_, of unpleasant taste,\r\nwhich is esteemed a valuable remedy in several disorders, both external and\r\ninternal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XV.--TETRADYNAMIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nSILICULOSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  183. _SEA KALE_ (Crambe maritima) _is a well-known plant in our\r\n  kitchen-gardens, the early shoots of which are blanched, and eaten in the\r\n  same manner as asparagus._\r\n\r\nThis plant grows wild on sandy sea-coasts in various parts of England; and\r\nhas been transplanted thence into the gardens. The mode of management is,\r\nin the autumn, to place large inverted garden-pots over the plants, and to\r\ncover the whole bed and the pots with dung and litter. The heat of the\r\nfermenting dung causes the plants to shoot early in the spring; and the\r\npots protect them and keep them clear of the litter. By this means also, as\r\nthey have no access to the light, they become blanched, tender, and of\r\nextremely sweet and delicate flavour.\r\n\r\nSea kale is ready for use some time before asparagus appears; and, for the\r\ntable, it is preferred by most persons to that favourite vegetable. If the\r\nleaves of sea kale be eaten when full grown, they are said to occasion\r\ngiddiness; but horses, cows, swine, and other animals, feed upon them\r\nwithout injury.\r\n\r\n  184. _WOAD is a dyeing drug, produced by a British plant_ (Isatis\r\n  tinctoria), _with arrow-shaped leaves on the stem, yellow cruciform\r\n  flowers, and oblong seed-vessels, each containing one seed._\r\n\r\nThis plant is believed to have been the same that was adopted by the\r\nancient Britons for staining, or painting their bodies a blue colour, to\r\nrender them, in appearance, at least, more terrible to their enemies. It\r\ngrows wild on the borders of corn-fields, in some parts of Cambridgeshire,\r\nSomersetshire, and Durham: and is cultivated in several of the clothing\r\ndistricts of England.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plants are in a sufficient state of maturity, they are\r\ngathered. The leaves are picked off, and submitted to the action of mills,\r\nsomewhat similar to the mills that are used for the grinding of oak-bark.\r\nIn these they are reduced to a pulp. The woad is then laid in small heaps,\r\nwhich are closely and smoothly pressed down. After continuing about a\r\nfortnight in this state, the heaps are broken up, and their substance is\r\nformed into balls, which are exposed to the sun to be dried. When the balls\r\nare perfectly dry, they are ready for use; and are employed, not only in\r\ndyeing blue, but also as the basis of several other colours.\r\n\r\n  185. _HORSE-RADISH_ (Cochlearia armoracia) _is a well-known\r\n  kitchen-garden plant, which grows wild by the sides of ditches and the\r\n  banks of rivers, in several parts of the north of England._\r\n\r\nThe _root_ of horse-radish is much used for culinary purposes. It is\r\nremarkable for great pungency both of smell and taste. When scraped, it is\r\nmixed with pickles to heighten their flavour, and is eaten with roast beef,\r\nfish, and several other kinds of food. Whenever more of the roots are dug\r\nout of the earth at once than are immediately wanted, they may be preserved\r\nfor some time, in a juicy state, by putting them into dry sand.\r\n\r\nHorse-radish is also in considerable repute as a medicine, and is a\r\npowerful stimulant, whether externally or internally applied.\r\nNotwithstanding this, we are informed by Dr. Withering, that an infusion of\r\nhorseradish in cold milk is one of the best and safest cosmetics that are\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILIQUOSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  186. _COMMON MUSTARD is made from the powdered seeds of a plant_ (Sinapis\r\n  nigra), _which grows wild in corn-fields and by road sides, in most parts\r\n  of England, and is known by its yellow cruciform flowers, with expanding\r\n  calyx, and its pods being smooth, square, and close to the stem._\r\n\r\nIn light and otherwise barren lands mustard is cultivated to great\r\nadvantage. That which is produced in the county of Durham has much\r\ncelebrity; though the powdered seeds of charlock have, in many instances,\r\nbeen substituted, and sold in place of it. Mustard is in daily use at our\r\ntables, and the _seeds_, whole or bruised, are employed in pickles, and for\r\nnumerous other culinary purposes. These seeds yield, on pressure, a\r\nconsiderable quantity of oil, which is soft and insipid to the taste, and\r\npartakes but little of the acrimony of the plant.\r\n\r\nDifferent preparations of mustard are sometimes used in medicine. The\r\nseeds, taken internally, are serviceable in asthma, rheumatism, and palsy.\r\nCataplasms of mustard are employed, on account of its stimulating\r\nproperties, on benumbed or paralytic limbs. An infusion of the powdered\r\nseeds, taken in considerable quantity, operates as an emetic, and, in\r\nsmaller quantity, is an useful aperient and diuretic.\r\n\r\n  187. _RAPE and COLE SEED_ (Brassica napus) _are different varieties of a\r\n  plant with yellow cruciform flowers and, spindle-shaped root, which grows\r\n  wild upon ditch banks, and amongst corn._\r\n\r\n  _This plant is distinguished from others of the same tribe by its roots\r\n  being a regular continuation of the stem._\r\n\r\nIn several parts of England rape and cole seed are sown intermixed, the\r\nplants being distinguishable in their growth by the cole exceeding the rape\r\nin height, being more soft and tender, and less branched and bushy. When\r\nsown separately the cole is usually, though not always, consumed as food\r\nfor sheep and cattle; and the rape is allowed to stand for seed. For the\r\ncultivation of rape the soil ought to be rich and deep.\r\n\r\nThe harvest commences about the month of August; and as the seed, when in a\r\nstate of maturity, is easily shed, it is customary, in some places, to\r\nthresh the plants on a large cloth in the field. Rape-cloths are sometimes\r\nso large as to measure twenty yards square, and to weigh more than half a\r\nton. The threshing is almost always considered a sort of festival, at which\r\na great portion of the neighbours attend, in order to expedite the work;\r\nand they are repaid by the good cheer of their brother farmer. In other\r\nplaces the rape is carried on a cloth, in a low kind of waggon, to be\r\nthreshed out of the field.\r\n\r\n_Oil_ is obtained from rape-seed by pressure. This is used, in large\r\nquantities, by clothiers and others. It is also used in medicine; and for\r\nmaking the soap called green soap. It is likewise useful for various\r\npurposes in domestic life, and particularly for burning in lamps; but it is\r\napt to become rancid, though there are means of purifying it. After the oil\r\nhas been extracted, the refuse is called _oil-cake_, and is employed for\r\nthe fattening of oxen; and, in Norfolk, is sometimes broken to pieces, and\r\nstrewed upon the land as manure. The _roots_ of rape plants may be eaten\r\nlike turnips, but they have a stronger taste. The _stalks_, or haulm, if\r\nstrong, may be advantageously employed in the formation of the enclosing\r\nfences of farm-yards. They are, however, generally burnt; and in some parts\r\nof the country, the ashes, which are equal in quality to the best\r\npot-ashes, are collected together and sold.\r\n\r\n  188. _The TURNIP_ (Brassica rapa) _is a well-known edible root, which is\r\n  cultivated to great extent in almost every part of England._\r\n\r\nTo the farmer turnips are, in various particulars, a most valuable crop.\r\nThey afford a profitable intervening crop with corn. Both the _tops_ and\r\n_roots_ are eaten by sheep. Horses and cattle may be advantageously fed\r\nupon the roots during winter; but the milk of cows receives an unpleasant\r\nflavour from them. This flavour is also communicated to the butter; but it\r\nmay be taken off by dissolving a little nitre in spring water, and putting\r\na small tea-cupful of it into about eight gallons of milk, when warm from\r\nthe cow. Turnips also serve as food for mankind, either boiled or roasted.\r\nIn the years 1629, 1636, and 1693, during the pressure of a severe famine,\r\nbread is stated to have been made of turnips in several parts of England,\r\nparticularly in the county of Essex. The process was to put the turnips\r\ninto a kettle over a slow fire, till they became soft; they were then taken\r\nout, squeezed as dry as possible, mixed with an equal quantity of flour,\r\nand, after having been kneaded with yeast, salt, and a little warm water,\r\nwere made into loaves and baked. In bread thus made the peculiar taste of\r\nthe turnip is said to be scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\nThese roots have been much recommended as sea store, from the possibility,\r\nwith care, of preserving them for a great length of time uninjured, and\r\nfrom their furnishing an agreeable and wholesome food for sailors, on long\r\nvoyages. The young and tender _tops_ of turnips, when boiled, afford an\r\nagreeable substitute for greens.\r\n\r\nFor the cultivation of turnips a light soil, particularly such as consists\r\nof a mixture of sand and loam, is found preferable to rich and heavy land.\r\nTurnips are raised from seed, which it has long been the established custom\r\nto sow in the month of June. As soon as the young plants have attained a\r\ntolerable size, they are hoed, for the purpose of thinning them. In their\r\ngrowth they suffer much by the attacks of slugs, caterpillars, and insects\r\nof different kinds, particularly of a small, dark beetle with two\r\nlongitudinal yellowish stripes (_Chrysomela nemorum_), which is called by\r\nfarmers the _turnip-fly_. For the destruction of this insect many plans\r\nhave, at different times, been devised.\r\n\r\nTurnips are either eaten on the land by cattle, or are drawn out and\r\nstacked, or preserved under ground for winter use; and, in this state, they\r\nmay be kept sound till April.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of turnips; but of these the _common white_, or\r\n_Norfolk turnips_, and the _Ruta-baga_, or _Swedish turnips_, are the\r\nprincipal. The latter, which indeed constitute a distinct species, are\r\ngenerally of a yellowish colour, and are so hardy as to suffer no injury\r\neven from the most intense cold; but their substance is so compact as\r\nsometimes to break the teeth of sheep which feed upon them.\r\n\r\n  189. _The COMMON CABBAGE_ (Brassica oleracea) _is a well-known plant, the\r\n  original stock of which grows on cliffs by the seaside, in Kent,\r\n  Cornwall, Yorkshire, and Wales._\r\n\r\n  _This wild plant is likewise the original of the various kinds of_\r\n  colewort, borecole, cauliflower, _and_ brocoli.\r\n\r\nThe effects of cultivation on the cabbage are very remarkable. In the wild\r\nplants the leaves are extended: but in the common garden cabbage they are\r\nset so close together as to lie upon each other, almost like the scales of\r\na bulb, and, increasing in compactness as they increase in size: those in\r\nthe interior being excluded from the effects of the light, do not assume a\r\ngreen, but are of yellow colour.\r\n\r\nOther plants of this species form their stalks into a head, as the\r\n_cauliflower_ and _brocoli_; and others grow, in a natural way, without\r\nforming either their leaves or stalks into heads, as the _coleworts_, or\r\n_Dorsetshire kale_, the _borcoles_, _turnip-rooted cabbage_, and others.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of England, cabbages of different kinds are much cultivated\r\nas food for cattle, and they succeed well in rich and finely prepared land.\r\nThe seed is sown in February or March. In April or May the young plants are\r\ntaken out, and set in rows, at a little distance from each other; and, in\r\nthe ensuing autumn and winter, the cabbages afford a valuable stock of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nAll the kinds of cabbage are useful for domestic purposes; and some of them\r\nafford a peculiarly sweet and delicate food. An agreeable pickle is made of\r\nthem, and the Germans, and people of other northern countries of the\r\nContinent, prepare from them a favourite food called _sour-crout_. These\r\nplants were known to, and much used by, the ancient Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\nCabbages are biennial plants, or are sown one year, produce seed in the\r\nensuing year, and then die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XVI.--MONADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  190. _TAMARINDS are the pulp and needs produced by the pods of a large\r\n  tree with winged leaves_ (Tamarindus Indica, Fig. 51), _which grows in\r\n  the East and West Indies, America, and several parts of Asia._\r\n\r\n  _This tree is from thirty to forty feet in height; and its leaves consist\r\n  usually of fourteen pairs of leaflets. The flowers are formed in\r\n  clusters, from the sides of the branches, and have each three yellowish\r\n  petals, beautifully marked with red veins._\r\n\r\n  _The fruit of the tamarind-tree is a roundish but somewhat compressed\r\n  pod, four or five inches in length, the external part of which is very\r\n  brittle. Each pod contains three or four hard seeds, enveloped in tough\r\n  skins, surrounded by a dark-coloured, acid pulp, and connected together\r\n  by numerous tough and woody fibres._\r\n\r\nPreviously to the exportation of tamarinds, the pulp, with the seeds and\r\nfibres, are freed from their shell: and those which we receive from the\r\nWest Indies are usually preserved in syrup. In Jamaica the fruit is\r\ngathered about the month of July. When fully ripe, and after the pods are\r\ncleared away, the remainder is placed in layers, in small casks: and\r\nboiling syrup, just before it begins to granulate, is poured upon them\r\nuntil the casks are filled, after which the heads are put in and fastened\r\nup for exportation.\r\n\r\nThe East Indian tamarinds are generally packed without any admixture. They\r\nare more esteemed than the others; and, when in the pods, are easily\r\ndistinguished from them by their being longer, and containing six or seven\r\nseeds; the pulp also is drier and of darker colour.\r\n\r\nIt is said that we are indebted to the Arabians for a knowledge of the use\r\nof tamarinds. In hot climates they are a most refreshing and delicious\r\nfruit; and, dissolved in water, are much used as a cooling and agreeable\r\nbeverage, particularly by persons suffering under fever. They also give\r\ngreat relief in sore throats, and other complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  191. _The SOUR-GOURD, BOABAB, or AFRICAN CALABASH-TREE_ (Adansonia\r\n  digitata) _is probably the largest of all vegetable productions. The\r\n  trunk, although not usually more than twelve or fifteen feet high, is\r\n  frequently from sixty to eighty feet in girth. The lowest branches extend\r\n  almost horizontally; and, as they are sometimes near sixty feet in\r\n  length, they bend, by their own weight, to the ground; and thus the whole\r\n  tree forms an hemispherical mass of verdure, which measures from 120 to\r\n  130 feet in diameter._\r\n\r\n  _The fruit is oblong, about ten inches in length, pointed at both ends,\r\n  and covered with a greenish down, under which there is a blackish and\r\n  woody rind. Its interior consists of a whitish, spongy, and juicy\r\n  substance, with several brown seeds._\r\n\r\n  _This tree is a native of Senegal and other parts of Africa._\r\n\r\nThe virtues and uses of the sour-gourd tree and its fruit are numerous and\r\nof great importance to the inhabitants of the countries in which it is\r\nfound. The _bark_ and _leaves_ are dried, powdered, and preserved in bags,\r\nto be employed as a seasoning for food. Two or three pinches of this powder\r\nare put, by the negroes, into their messes, under an impression that it\r\npromotes perspiration and moderates the heat of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe pulp of the _fruit_ has an agreeably acid flavour. This is not only\r\neaten when fresh, but is dried and powdered for medicinal uses; a kind of\r\nsoap is also prepared from it.\r\n\r\nIn Senegal, when the trees are decayed, the _trunks_ are hollowed, by the\r\nnegroes, into burying-places for their poets, musicians, and buffoons.\r\nThese persons are much esteemed whilst they live, although they are\r\nsupposed to derive their superior talents from sorcery or an alliance with\r\ndemons. When dead, however, their bodies are regarded with horror, and are\r\nnot allowed the usual burial, under a notion that the earth would, in such\r\ncase, refuse to produce its accustomed fruits. The bodies inclosed in these\r\ntrees are said to become perfectly dry without decaying, and thus to form a\r\nkind of mummies, without the process of embalming.\r\n\r\n  192. _COTTON is a soft vegetable down, which is contained in the seed\r\n  vessels, and envelopes the seeds of the cotton-plant_ (Gosypium\r\n  herbaceum, Fig. 52), _which is cultivated in the East and West Indies,\r\n  and numerous other countries of hot climates._.\r\n\r\n  _This, though an annual plant, grows to a considerable heights It has\r\n  leaves of bright green colour, marked with brownish veins, and each\r\n  divided into five lobes. The flowers have only one petal, in five\r\n  segments, with a short tube, and are of pale yellow colour, with five red\r\n  spots at the bottom._\r\n\r\nThe cotton pods are of somewhat triangular shape, and have each three\r\ncells. These, when ripe, burst, and disclose their snow-white or yellowish\r\ncontents, in the midst of which are contained small black seeds, in shape\r\nsomewhat resembling those of grapes.\r\n\r\nWe are informed, by Mr. Edwards, that the plants are raised from seed, the\r\nland requiring no other preparation for them than to be cleared of its\r\nnative incumbrances. The seeds are usually sown in rows six or eight feet\r\nasunder, and the holes in which they are put are about four feet apart. At\r\nthe end of five months the plants begin to flower, and in two months more\r\nthe pods are formed. After the cotton is gathered, it is freed from the\r\nseeds to which it is attached, by a very simple machine, consisting of two\r\nsmall rollers that are close and parallel to each other, and move in\r\nopposite directions. The cotton is next hand-picked, to free it from\r\ndecayed leaves, broken seeds, and other impurities; after which it is\r\npacked, for sale, in bags of about two hundred pounds each.\r\n\r\nThough the cotton plant flourishes best in tropical climates, it is capable\r\nof cultivation in such as are not so hot; and it is now an object of\r\nattention in several of the southern parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nWe receive great quantities of cotton from America, and the East and West\r\nIndies. The whole quantity imported into this country, in the year 1802,\r\nexceeded 60,000,000 pounds' weight; whilst the average annual importation,\r\nanterior to 1780, did not amount to one tenth part of this; so rapid has\r\nbeen the increase and prosperity of our cotton manufactories. Calicoes and\r\nmuslins of all kinds are made of cotton; fustians, corderoys, and\r\ninnumerable other articles. Nankeens, which are manufactured in India, are\r\nmade of a kind of cotton which is naturally of a reddish buff colour.\r\n\r\nAfter the cotton is imported into England, the first process which it goes\r\nthrough is that of _carding_. Some years ago, this was performed by the\r\nhand, upon the knee, with a single pair of cards; but it is now performed\r\nwith cylindrical cards, worked by machinery. The next and most important\r\nimprovements in the manufacture of cotton, were made at Cromford, in the\r\ncounty of Derby, by the late Sir Richard Arkwright; who, in 1768, first\r\nintroduced the method of _spinning_ cotton by machinery. By this\r\ncontrivance cotton was _carded_, _roved_, and _spun_, with the utmost\r\nexpedition, correctness, and equality. Other machines have, at different\r\nsubsequent periods, been invented by various mechanics and manufacturers,\r\nparticularly that called a _jenny_, by which one person is able to spin a\r\nhundred hanks of cotton yarn a-day, containing, in the whole, near a\r\nmillion of yards. The concluding operation is that of weaving, which is\r\nperformed with a machine called a loom, in the same manner as flax (97) and\r\nhemp (259).\r\n\r\nCotton is capable of being manufactured into paper, which is little\r\ninferior to that made from linen rags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XVII.--DIADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDECANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  193. _The COMMON BROOM_ (Spartium scoparium) _is a shrub common on sandy\r\n  pastures and heaths in nearly all the southern parts of England; and is\r\n  distinguished by having large, yellow, butterfly-shaped flowers, leaves\r\n  in threes, and single, and the branches angular._\r\n\r\nFew of our wild plants are applicable to more numerous purposes of domestic\r\nutility than this. Its _twigs_ are tied in bundles, and formed into brooms.\r\nSome persons roast the _seeds_, and make them into a kind of coffee. The\r\nfibrous and elastic parts of the _bark_, after having been separated by\r\nsoaking in water, may be manufactured into cordage, matting, and even into\r\na coarse kind of cloth. The twigs and young branches have been successfully\r\nemployed as a substitute for oak bark, in the tanning of leather. They may\r\nalso be rendered serviceable as thatch for houses, and corn ricks; and some\r\npersons mix them with hops in brewing; but it is doubtful whether, in this\r\nrespect, they are wholesome. The _flower buds_, when pickled, have\r\noccasionally been used as a substitute for capers.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_, where the dimensions are sufficient for the purpose, is\r\nemployed by cabinet-makers for veneering; and it is stated by Dr. Mead,\r\nthat a decoction of the green tops, in conjunction with mustard, has been\r\nfound efficacious in the cure of dropsy.\r\n\r\n  194. _SPANISH BROOM, or SPART_ (Spartium junceum), _is a well-known\r\n  ornamental flowering shrub in our gardens, which has opposite, round\r\n  branches, that flower at the top, and spear-shaped leaves._\r\n\r\nIn the province of Valencia, and other parts of Spain, great attention is\r\npaid to this manufacture of various articles from the _twigs_ and _bark_ of\r\nthis shrub. They are plaited into mats, carpets, coverings for plants,\r\nbaskets, ropes, and even shoes. A great portion of these twigs was formerly\r\nexported to different French ports in the Mediterranean, particularly to\r\nMarseilles; but, in 1783, on account of the employment of which it deprived\r\nthe Spanish people in working them, their exportation was prohibited by the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n  195. _FURZE, GORZE, or WHIN_ (Ulex Europæus), _is a well-known thorny\r\n  shrub, which is common on heaths and waste ground in almost every part of\r\n  England._\r\n\r\nThe chief use to which furze is applied, is for the heating of ovens; and,\r\nin this respect, it is valuable, from its burning rapidly, and emitting a\r\ngreat degree of heat. Its _ashes_ are used for a ley, which is of\r\nconsiderable service in the washing of linen.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country, furze is sown on banks, round fields, for the\r\npurpose of a fence; and it will flourish even close to the sea side, where\r\nthe spray of the sea destroys almost every other shrub. But it will not\r\nbear severe cold, and it is often destroyed by intense frost. Furze does\r\nnot often occur in the northern parts of our island.\r\n\r\nHorses, sheep, and cattle may be fed on this shrub; and, in several places,\r\nthe seeds of it are sown, either by themselves, or with barley, oats, or\r\nbuck-wheat (126). The plants are mown a year afterwards. They will grow for\r\nseveral years, and produce from ten to fifteen tons per acre of food, which\r\nis equal, in quality and excellence, to the same quantity of hay. They are\r\nbruised before they are eaten, either in a machine, or by heavy mallets on\r\nblocks of wood. This operation is requisite, in order to break the\r\nprickles, and prevent these from being injurious to the mouths of the\r\nanimals that eat them.\r\n\r\n  196. _COWHAGE, or COW-ITCH, is a sharp and barbed kind of down or hair,\r\n  which thickly clothes the pods of a bean-like climbing plant_ (Dolichos\r\n  pruriens, Fig. 53), _that grows in the West Indies, and other countries\r\n  of warm climates._\r\n\r\n  _This is an herbaceous plant, which entwines round the adjacent trees or\r\n  shrubs, and often rises to a considerable height. The leaves grow in\r\n  threes upon long foot-stalks; and the flowers are large, butter-fly\r\n  shaped, of purplish colour, and form long and pendant spikes, which have\r\n  a very beautiful appearance._\r\n\r\nIt is the property of cowhage, when rubbed upon the skin, immediately to\r\npenetrate it, and to cause an intolerable itching. Hence it is sometimes\r\nwantonly employed for mischievous purposes; and hence also it is found very\r\ntroublesome to cattle and domestic animals, in places where the plants\r\ngrow. Notwithstanding this, it may be swallowed in safety, and, if taken\r\ninto the stomach and intestines, is said to be an useful remedy for the\r\ndestruction of worms. As a medicine, it is mixed with syrup or treacle into\r\nthe form of an electuary.\r\n\r\n  197. _SOY is a dark-coloured sauce, which is prepared from the seeds of a\r\n  Chinese plant_ (Dolichos soja), _that has an erect and hairy stem, erect\r\n  branches of flowers, and pendulous bristly pods, each containing about\r\n  two seeds._\r\n\r\nThere is a joke amongst seamen, that soy is made from beetles or\r\ncockroaches. This probably originates in the seeds of the plant from which\r\nthe sauce is manufactured having some fancied resemblance, in shape and\r\ncolour, to a beetle. These _seeds_ are used in China and Japan as food.\r\nThey are made into a kind of jelly or curd, which is esteemed very\r\nnutritious, and which is rendered palatable by seasoning of different\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nThe liquid which we know by the name of _soy_ is thus prepared:--After the\r\nseeds have been boiled until they become soft, they are mixed with an equal\r\nweight of wheat or barley meal, coarsely ground. This mixture is fermented;\r\nand a certain proportion of salt and water being added, the whole is\r\nallowed to stand for two or three months, care being taken to stir it every\r\nday; and, by the end of that time, it is ready for use.\r\n\r\nSoy is chiefly prepared in China and Japan; but that imported from Japan is\r\nconsidered preferable to any other. The quantity annually vended at the\r\nEast India Company's sales is from eight hundred to two thousand gallons,\r\nat an average price of sixteen or eighteen shillings per gallon.\r\n\r\n  198. _BEANS_ (Vicia faba) _are well-known seeds, originally introduced\r\n  from Persia, of which there are several kinds or varieties; some of these\r\n  are cultivated in fields, and others in gardens._\r\n\r\n_Field_, or _horse-beans_, as they are frequently called, are small and\r\nsomewhat round. The cultivation of them is pursued to a considerable\r\nextent. They are esteemed, in many respects, an advantageous crop to the\r\nfarmer, and will thrive on any land where the soil is sufficiently stiff.\r\nThey are usually sown in the month of February; sometimes in the autumn;\r\nbut, in case of severe frost, all the plants that are not well and deeply\r\ncovered with snow will perish. There is also much uncertainty in the crop,\r\nowing to the state of the weather in the spring and summer; and\r\nparticularly to the ravages of small black insects, myriads of which are\r\nfrequently seen to crowd the tender tops of the plants.\r\n\r\nThe bean-harvest is seldom completed till nearly the end of September,\r\nowing to the bulk and succulence of the plants; and the produce is from two\r\nand a half to five quarters per acre.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of field-beans; but the fine and very small\r\nones usually bear the highest price. Bean flour is not only thought more\r\nnutritive, but is found to be more abundant than that of oats. Beans are\r\nchiefly applied to the feeding of horses, hogs, and other domestic animals;\r\nand it is supposed that meal-men often grind them amongst wheat, the flour\r\nof which is to be made into bread. By some persons they are roasted, and\r\nadopted as a substitute for coffee. With the Roman ladies bean-flour was in\r\nmuch repute as a cosmetic.\r\n\r\n_Garden-beans_ are almost wholly confined to culinary uses. What are called\r\n_French-beans_, and _Kidney-beans_, belong to a different tribe from the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nBean _stalks_, if subjected to a certain process, are capable of being\r\nconverted into paper.\r\n\r\n  199. _VETCHES are a small species of beans_ (Vicia sativa) _which grow\r\n  wild in dry meadows, pastures, and cornfields, and are also cultivated in\r\n  most parts of England._\r\n\r\n  _The pods are generally in pairs; and the leaves winged, having each\r\n  about six pairs of leaflets, with a branched tendril at the extremity. At\r\n  the bases of each of the leaves there is a small stipule, marked with a\r\n  dark spot._\r\n\r\nThe principal use of vetches is as provender for horses and cattle. They\r\nare grown so early as to allow of being fed off, or cut for this purpose,\r\nin sufficient time for turnips to be sown the same year. When the land is\r\nto be prepared for a wheat crop it is sometimes customary to plough in the\r\nvetches as manure. The _seeds_ afford a grateful food for pigeons.\r\n\r\n  200. _PEAS_ (Pisum sativum) _are a kind of seeds too well known to need\r\n  any description._\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of peas, some of which are cultivated in gardens,\r\nand others in fields. The former are principally used for culinary\r\npurposes. In the early part of the year, gardeners in the neighbourhood of\r\nLondon raise them on hot-beds. The kind they select for this purpose are\r\nthe dwarf peas. These are sown about the middle of October in warm borders;\r\nand afterwards, towards the end of January, they are removed into the\r\nhot-beds. The inducement, of course, is the enormous prices that are paid\r\nfor the earliest peas brought into the market. The podding or picking of\r\ngreen peas for the London market is also a valuable branch of the business\r\nof some farms within a few miles of the metropolis. Many attempts have been\r\nmade to preserve green peas for use in winter; one of these is by bottling\r\nthem, and another by drying them in an oven, and afterwards keeping them in\r\npaper bags; but none of the modes have been attended with complete success.\r\n\r\nField peas are sown about March or April, and succeed best in light, rich\r\nsoils. They are generally considered an uncertain crop; but this is owing,\r\nin a great degree, to want of due attention to their culture.\r\n\r\nIn common with most other seeds of this class, peas yield a nutritive food\r\nto persons of strong stomachs. When boiled in a fresh or green state, they\r\nare both wholesome and agreeable; and, when ripe and ground into meal, they\r\nare peculiarly serviceable for the fattening of swine. The flour of peas is\r\nnot unfrequently mixed by bakers amongst that of wheat for bread; but bread\r\nmade of this flour alone is heavy and unwholesome. Three parts of rye-flour\r\nand one of ground peas are said to yield a palatable and nourishing bread.\r\nPeas that are freed from their husks, and split in mills constructed for\r\nthe purpose, are used for soup. The haulm or _straw_ of field peas, if\r\nsaved in favourable seasons, affords not only an excellent fodder for\r\nworking horses, but is also an useful food for horses, cattle, and sheep.\r\n\r\nIt has been presumed that the _everlasting pea_, which is commonly grown as\r\nan ornamental flower in our gardens, would be an advantageous green food\r\nfor horses and cattle.\r\n\r\n  201. _LIQUORICE is the root of a perennial plant_ (Glycyrrhiza glabra),\r\n  _with winged leaves, and purplish butterfly-shaped flowers, which grows\r\n  wild in the south of Europe, and is cultivated near Pontefract in\r\n  Yorkshire, Worksop in Nottinghamshire, and Godalming in Surrey, and by\r\n  many gardeners in the vicinity of London._\r\n\r\n  _The stalks of the liquorice-plant are usually four or five feet high.\r\n  The leaves are winged, and the leaflets egg-shaped, with an odd one at\r\n  the extremity. The flowers grow in long spikes from the junction of the\r\n  leaves and branches. The roots are long, round, tough, of brown colour\r\n  externally, and yellow within._\r\n\r\nThe principal use of liquorice is in medicine. It contains much saccharine\r\nmatter, joined with some portion of mucilage; and is one of the few sweet\r\nsubstances which tend to allay thirst. Liquorice is an excellent medicine\r\nin coughs and hoarsenesses. When boiled in a little water, it gives out\r\nnearly all its sweetness; and this, when the moisture is evaporated,\r\nproduces, by different processes, what are called _Spanish liquorice_,\r\n_liquorice cakes_, _liquorice lozenges_, and _Pontefract cakes_. The former\r\nof these is used to great extent in the brewing of porter. It is said that\r\nmore than two hundred tons' weight of it are annually manufactured in\r\nSpain, a considerable portion of which is sold to the London brewers for\r\nthis purpose. Liquorice powder, which is used in medicine, is often\r\nadulterated with flour, and probably also with less wholesome articles. The\r\nroot itself may be employed as stopples for beer or wine bottles.\r\n\r\nThe soil in which liquorice is cultivated should be deep, light, and sandy;\r\nand the roots, which strike deeply into the ground, should be planted in\r\nrows, at the distance of a foot and half or two feet from each other. Three\r\nyears elapse, after the roots are planted, before the liquorice is in\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n  202. _SAINT-FOIN_ (Hedysarum onobrychis) _is a British perennial plant\r\n  with winged leaves, somewhat pyramidal bunches of butterfly-shaped\r\n  flowers, marked with red, white, and purple; and oblong, hairy pods, each\r\n  containing a single seed._\r\n\r\nThis plant is cultivated in several of the farming districts of England, as\r\nfood for horses and cattle; and it succeeds best on dry and chalky lands,\r\nin high and exposed situations. The seed should be sown in February or\r\nMarch, and, during the first year, the plants should remain untouched. In\r\nthe ensuing summer a crop of hay may be obtained from them; and after this\r\nthe saint-foin may regularly be mown twice every year, for ten or fifteen\r\nyears. When intended for hay, saint-foin should not be cut before it is in\r\nfull bloom, about the beginning of July, as otherwise the quality of the\r\nhay would be much injured. Some farmers assert that saint-foin, when cows\r\nare fed with it, both increases the quantity and improves the quality of\r\ntheir milk; but, in the opinion of others, the quality is rather injured\r\nthan improved by it. No pasture is considered more excellent for sheep than\r\nthis. Saint-foin is also sometimes sown with clover, and sometimes with\r\nbarley.\r\n\r\n  203. _COMMON RED or BROAD CLOVER_ (Trifolium pratense) _is a well-known\r\n  field plant, much cultivated in this country._\r\n\r\nClover is chiefly grown in firm and good soils, either as green food for\r\nhorses and cattle, or to be cut for hay. On grass farms it is sometimes\r\nsown in conjunction with spring corn, and sometimes with ray-grass (51);\r\nand its utility in the fattening of cattle is well known. This species of\r\nclover grows wild, in meadows and pastures of most parts of Europe; and, in\r\nsome countries, during a scarcity of provisions, the flowers have been made\r\ninto a kind of bread. In Sweden the heads are used as a green dye.\r\n\r\n  204. _LUCERN_ (Medicago sativa) _is a perennial plant with small purple\r\n  butterfly-shaped flowers, twisted pods, the stem erect and smooth, and\r\n  the leaves in threes._\r\n\r\nAlthough a wild plant in nearly every country of the temperate parts of\r\nEurope, this useful vegetable has only of late years been introduced into\r\ncultivation. It flourishes most luxuriantly in deep, rich, and friable\r\nloams, and cannot be too strongly recommended as food for cattle. The value\r\nof lucern may be considerably increased by sowing it with oats; and, though\r\nan expensive crop, it yields great profit.\r\n\r\n  205. _INDIGO is a blue dye prepared from a plant_ (Indigofera tinctoria)\r\n  _with a shrubby stem, oblong, smooth, and winged leaves, bunches of\r\n  flowers shorter than the leaves, and cylindrical pods slightly curved,\r\n  which grows in America and the West Indies._\r\n\r\nThe culture of indigo is an object of considerable importance in the West\r\nIndian islands, and in some parts of America. The grounds appropriated to\r\nit are sown about the middle of March, in rows fifteen inches asunder. The\r\nplants come into flower about three months afterwards, and are in a state\r\nto be cut about the month of August. They are cut with a kind of reaping\r\nhook, a few inches above the root. The plants are then laid in strata, in a\r\nvat or cistern constructed of strong mason-work, and so much water is\r\npoured in as will cover them. In this state they are left to ferment, and\r\nthe fluid or pulp, which is first green, afterwards becomes of deep blue\r\ncolour. It is now drawn off into another vat, where it is strongly and\r\nincessantly beaten and agitated, until the colouring matter is united into\r\na body. The water is then let off by cocks in the sides of the vat; and the\r\nindigo, after undergoing some further preparations, is cast, in boxes or\r\nmoulds, into small pieces, each about an inch square, and packed up for\r\nsale. The vapour which issues from the fermented liquor is extremely\r\ninjurious to the negroes who attend the process; and as peculiar attention\r\nis requisite both to this and the granulating of the pulp, many\r\nindigo-planters have failed in the manufacture of this article.\r\n\r\nIndigo is employed by dyers, calico-printers, and paper-stainers, to an\r\nextent so great that nearly 500,000 pounds' weight of it are annually\r\nimported into this kingdom. The _stone-blue_ used by laundresses, and the\r\ncolours called _Saxon-blue_, and _green_, are made from indigo. Painters\r\nuse it as a water-colour. This article is frequently adulterated with\r\nearth, ashes, and pounded slate. The genuine drug ought to be of rich, dark\r\nblue colour, approaching to black; and, when broken, should display the\r\nlustre of copper. It ought not to sink in water, nor to leave any sediment\r\nwhen dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XVIII.--POLYADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDECANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  206. _CHOCOLATE is a kind of cake or hard paste, sometimes made of\r\n  different ingredients, but the basis of which is the pulp of the cacao or\r\n  chocolate nut, a produce of the West Indies and America._\r\n\r\n  _The chocolate tree_ (Theobroma cacao, Fig. 54,) _both in size and shape,\r\n  somewhat resembles a young cherry tree, but it separates near the ground\r\n  into four or five stems. The leaves are each about four inches in length,\r\n  smooth but not glossy, and of dull green colour. The flowers are\r\n  saffron-coloured, and very beautiful._\r\n\r\nThe _fruit_ of the chocolate-tree somewhat resembles a cucumber in shape,\r\nbut is furrowed deeper on the sides. Its colour, while growing, is green;\r\nbut, as it ripens, this changes to a fine bluish red, almost purple, with\r\npink veins; or, in some of the varieties, to a delicate yellow or lemon\r\ncolour. Each of the pods contains from twenty to thirty nuts or kernels,\r\nwhich in shape are not much unlike almonds. These are arranged in rows,\r\nsurrounded by a sweet pulpy substance, and are called _cacao_ or\r\n_chocolate-nuts_.\r\n\r\nPlantations of chocolate trees are numerous on the banks of the river\r\nMagdelana, in South America, and in the Caraccas; but, at present, there\r\nare very few in our own colonies. They are usually formed in morassy\r\nsituations; and are sheltered from the intense heat of the sun by larger\r\ntrees which are planted among them. There are two principal crops of\r\nchocolate-nuts in the year; the first in June, and the second in December.\r\nAs soon as the fruit is ripe, it is gathered, and cut into slices; and the\r\nnuts, which at this time are in a pulpy state, are taken out with the hand;\r\nfor the thinness of their husk precludes the possibility of using a\r\nmachine. They are then laid in skins, or on leaves, to be dried in the sun.\r\nThey have now a sweetish acid taste, and may be eaten like any other fruit.\r\nWhen perfectly dry they are put into bags, each containing about a hundred\r\nweight; and, thus packed, are exported to foreign countries.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the preparation of these nuts into the substance which we\r\ncall chocolate, they are gently roasted, or parched over the fire, in an\r\niron vessel, after which process their thin external covering is easily\r\nseparated. The kernel is then pounded in a mortar, and subsequently ground\r\non a smooth warm stone. Sometimes a little arnatto (173) is added; and,\r\nwith the aid of water, the whole is formed into a paste. This, whilst hot,\r\nis put into tin moulds, where in a short time it congeals; and in this\r\nstate it is the chocolate of the shops. In South America and Spain other\r\nmodes are adopted; the chocolate is mixed with sugar, long pepper (21),\r\nvanilla, cinnamon, cloves, almonds, and other ingredients, according to the\r\ntaste of the respective inhabitants. Mr. Edwards was of opinion, that the\r\ncakes of chocolate used in England were made of about one half genuine\r\nchocolate, and the remainder of flour, or Castile soap.\r\n\r\nChocolate was first introduced into Europe by the Spaniards, and that from\r\nthe Caraccas is considered the best. It should be used whilst new, as\r\nneither the seeds nor the cakes will keep well more than two years. The\r\nchocolate used in this country must be manufactured in England, for, by an\r\nAct of the legislature, the importation of chocolate paste is prohibited,\r\nunder heavy penalties. The mode in which this substance is immediately\r\nprepared for use is well known.\r\n\r\nBy the natives of South America chocolate _nuts_ are used for food, and\r\nalso as a circulating medium instead of coin: about 1200 of them being\r\nconsidered equal in value to a dollar.\r\n\r\nA white oily matter, about the consistence of suet, is obtained by bruising\r\nthese nuts, and boiling the pulp. The oil is by this means liquefied, and\r\nrises to the surface, where it is left to cool and congeal, that it may the\r\nmore easily be separated. This, which is called _butter of cacao_, is\r\nwithout smell, and, when fresh, has a very mild taste. Its principal use is\r\nas an ingredient in pomatums. From the nuts, when slightly roasted, an oil\r\nis sometimes obtained by pressure, which is occasionally used in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nICOSANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  207. _The CITRON, LIME, and LEMON, are different varieties of the fruit\r\n  of a small evergreen shrub, the original or parent stock of which_\r\n  (Citrus medica) _was imported from Asia into the southern parts of\r\n  Europe._\r\n\r\n  _The_ citron _is oblong, with a very thick rind; the_ lemon _is oblong\r\n  with a small lump or protuberance at the end; and the_ lime _has no\r\n  protuberance, has a very thin rind, and is about the size of a small egg.\r\n  These are the principal marks of discrimination betwixt these fruits, but\r\n  they are not quite constant._\r\n\r\n  _The lemon shrub_ (_Fig. 56_) _has large and slightly indented shining\r\n  leaves, of somewhat oval shape, but pointed; and on the footstalks of the\r\n  leaves there is no remarkable appendage. The flowers are large and white,\r\n  but purplish on the outside of the petals._\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that the _citron-tree_ was first introduced from\r\nAssyria and Media into Greece, and thence into the Southern parts of\r\nEurope, where it is now cultivated to considerable extent. It is also grown\r\nin the islands of the West Indies. The fruit, partaking of the same quality\r\nas the lemon, with the exception of being somewhat less acid, is seldom\r\neaten raw; but, preserved in sugar as a sweetmeat, it is much used by\r\nconfectioners and others. The principal consumption of citron is on the\r\nContinent, where it is also occasionally employed in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe _lemon-tree_ is a native of Upper Asia, whence, like the citron, it was\r\nbrought into Greece, and afterwards transplanted into Italy. The _juice_,\r\nwhich is one of the sharpest and most agreeable of all acids, is used in\r\ncookery, confectionary, medicine, and in various other ways. By\r\ncalico-printers it is very extensively employed, as a discharger of colour,\r\nto produce, with more clearness and effect, the white figured parts of\r\ncoloured patterns that are dyed with colours formed from iron. Its juice is\r\nprocured by simply squeezing the fruit, and straining it through linen or\r\nany loose filter; and in Sicily, and other parts of the Mediterranean, it\r\nforms an important article of commerce. Being one of the most valuable\r\nremedies for the scurvy, with which we are acquainted, it generally\r\nconstitutes part of the sea store of ships that are destined for long\r\nvoyages.\r\n\r\nSeveral modes have been recommended for preserving lemon juice. One of\r\nthese is to put it into bottles, with a small quantity of oil, which,\r\nfloating on the surface, prevents the immediate contact of the air, and\r\nretards the decomposition of the acid; though, in this case, the original\r\nfresh taste soon gives place to one which is less grateful. In the East\r\nIndies lemon juice is sometimes evaporated, by a gentle heat, to the\r\nconsistence of a thick extract. Sometimes it is crystallized into a white\r\nand acid salt; but what is sold in the shops, under the name of _essential\r\nsalt of lemons_, for taking out ink-stains and iron-mould spots from linen,\r\nis only a preparation from the juice of sorrel.\r\n\r\nThe external part of the _rind_ has a grateful aromatic and bitter taste,\r\nwhich renders it useful in cookery. When dried it is considered a good\r\nstomachic, promotes the appetite, and is otherwise serviceable as a\r\nmedicine. It is often candied and made into a sweetmeat, under the name of\r\n_lemon chips_. When distilled it yields a light and almost colourless oil,\r\nwhich, in smell, is nearly as agreeable as the fresh peel, and is\r\nfrequently employed as a perfume.\r\n\r\nLemons are sometimes preserved in syrup. Small ones with thick rinds are\r\nconverted into a grateful pickle; and a marmalade and syrup are also made\r\nof them. For the purpose of keeping the fruit, it is recommended that a\r\nfine packthread about a quarter of a yard long, should be run through the\r\nprotuberance at the end of the lemons: the ends of the string are to be\r\ntied together, and suspended on a hook in an airy situation, and in such\r\nmanner that each lemon may hang perfectly free and detached.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the _lime_ is much attended to in several parts of North\r\nAmerica and the West Indies. Its juice affords a more grateful acid than\r\nthat of the lemon, which is there in little repute, and is, comparatively,\r\nbut seldom seen. A plate of limes is said to be a constant dish at\r\nentertainments in the West Indies; and the juice is used for all the same\r\npurposes as that of lemons is with us.\r\n\r\n  208. _ORANGE_ (Citrus aurantium, Fig. 55). _The difference betwixt orange\r\n  and lemon-trees is immediately known by the former having a kind of\r\n  winged appendage on the leafstalks, of which the latter are destitute._\r\n\r\nWe are informed that the first orange-tree introduced into Europe was sent\r\nas a present, from some part of Asia, to the Conde Mellor, prime minister\r\nof the King of Portugal. It was the only one of a great number which were\r\ncontained in the same chest that survived; and it became the parent stock\r\nof multitudes of subsequent trees.\r\n\r\nThe delightful perfume of an orange grove is such as to scent the air for\r\nmiles, and the _flowers_ appear in succession during the whole summer; and\r\nflowers and ripe fruit are found on the same tree. Orange flowers are\r\nvalued as a perfume, and yield their flavour to rectified spirits; and, in\r\ndistillation, both to spirits and water. In Portugal and Italy a fragrant\r\nred-coloured oil is obtained from them, which, by some persons, is\r\nconsidered of more delicate and agreeable perfume than even ottar of roses.\r\n\r\nThe _juice_ of the orange, when ripe and of good kind, is extremely sweet,\r\ngrateful, and wholesome. In fevers, and other complaints, it is of\r\nconsiderable use for allaying heat and quenching thirst; and, in scurvy, it\r\nhas been found a very valuable remedy. The _rind_, which yields a grateful\r\naromatic bitter, is sometimes used in medicine, and, in particular, has\r\nobtained notice for the cure of intermittent fevers or agues. It is\r\nfrequently preserved in syrup, and also in sugar, under the name of\r\npreserved _orange-peel_, and _orange-chips_; and is much esteemed in\r\ndesserts.\r\n\r\nIn cookery and by confectioners, oranges are used in numerous ways; for\r\nmarmalade, in biscuits, cheesecakes, jelly, puddings, and tarts; and an\r\nagreeable wine is prepared from oranges, with water, sugar, and some other\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n_Seville_, or _bitter oranges_ are a large, dark-coloured, and\r\nrough-skinned variety of the common species. These are much used in\r\nmedicine and cookery.\r\n\r\n_Bergamot_ is a well-known perfume, obtained from the rind of a variety of\r\norange much cultivated near the town of Bergamo in Italy, whence it has\r\nobtained its name. The rind is cut into small pieces, and the oil is\r\npressed out into glass vessels. Sometimes a fragrant water is distilled\r\nfrom the peel.\r\n\r\n  209. _The SHADDOCK_ (Citrus decumana) _is a yellowish green fruit, of the\r\n  orange kind, as large as the head of a child, with twelve or more cells,\r\n  and contains a red or whitish pulp. It is very common in many parts both\r\n  of the East and West Indies._\r\n\r\nIn hot climates the shaddock is much esteemed on account of its agreeable\r\nflavour, which is a pleasant mixture of sweet and acid. It is safely eaten,\r\neven in considerable quantities, and is esteemed very salubrious. The rind\r\nis thick, and has a disagreeable bitterish taste. This fruit is indebted,\r\nfor its name, to a Captain Shaddock, who is said to have first brought it\r\nfrom China, or, as some say, from Guinea, and transplanted it into one of\r\nthe West Indian islands.\r\n\r\n  210. _CAJEPUT is a greenish coloured oil produced from the fruit of a\r\n  tree_ (Melaleuca leucodendron) _which grows in the East Indies._\r\n\r\n  _This tree has a long flexible trunk; with linear spear-shaped, alternate\r\n  leaves, which are smooth, ash-coloured, and each with five nerves. The\r\n  flowers are white, and in long, terminal spikes._\r\n\r\nThe _leaves_ of the cajeput tree have an aromatic odour, somewhat\r\nresembling that of cardamom seed (15); and they yield, by distillation, an\r\nessential oil, which manifests this aromatic principle still more strongly.\r\n\r\nAmong the Malays cajeput oil is a medicine in great repute; but its uses\r\nare so little known in this country that it is rarely kept even in the\r\nshops of the metropolis. In acute rheumatism and gout, however, it has been\r\nknown to afford immediate relief by being rubbed on the part affected; but\r\nit ought not to be applied without great care, as it is very powerful in\r\nits effects. Cajeput oil is one of the most valuable remedies which have\r\nhitherto been discovered for the toothache. From whatever cause this\r\naffection of the face may proceed, whether from a carious or hollow tooth,\r\nrheumatic acrimony, or cold, this oil has generally been found efficacious\r\nin removing it. It is best applied by being dropped on lint, and placed in\r\nthe cavity of the tooth, or round the gum. Hence it deserves a place in the\r\nmedicine chest of every private family.\r\n\r\nIf taken internally, in a dose of five or six drops, it heats and\r\nstimulates the whole system; and it is said to have had a beneficial effect\r\nin dropsies and intermittent fevers. In India it is used, both internally\r\nand externally, in palsies, deafness, gout, rheumatism, and several other\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nIts odour is remarkably destructive to insects. A few drops of it, in a\r\ncabinet or drawer in which animal or vegetable specimens of natural history\r\nare kept, in a dried state, have, on this account, been found useful.\r\n\r\nCajeput oil is chiefly prepared in the island of Bouro, one of the\r\nMoluccas; and it is imported into Europe from the East Indies. But, from\r\nits high price, it is so frequently adulterated, that it is seldom to be\r\nhad genuine in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XIX.--SYNGENESIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nÆQUALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  211. _The ARTICHOKE_ (Cynara scolymus) _is a well-known plant which is\r\n  grown chiefly for culinary purposes, and was originally imported into\r\n  this country from the south of Europe._\r\n\r\nThis plant was cultivated with us as early as the year 1580. The parts that\r\nare eaten are the receptacle of the flower, which is called the _bottom_,\r\nand a fleshy substance on each of the scales of the calyx. The _choke_\r\nconsists of the unopened florets, and the bristles that separate them from\r\neach other: these stand upon the receptacle, and must be cleared away\r\nbefore the bottom can be eaten. Its name has doubtless been obtained from a\r\nnotion that any one unlucky enough to get it into his throat must certainly\r\nbe choked.\r\n\r\nWith us artichokes are generally plain boiled, and eaten with melted butter\r\nand pepper; and they are considered both wholesome and nutritious. The\r\nbottoms are sometimes stewed, boiled in milk, or added to ragouts, French\r\npies, and other highly-seasoned dishes. For winter use they may be slowly\r\ndried in an oven, and kept in paper bags in a dry place. On the Continent\r\nartichokes are frequently eaten raw, with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nBy the country people of France the _flowers_ of the artichoke are\r\nsometimes used to coagulate milk, for the purpose of making cheese. The\r\n_leaves_ and _stalks_ contain a bitter juice, which, mixed with an equal\r\nportion of white wine, has been successfully employed in the cure of\r\ndropsy, when other remedies have failed. The juice, prepared with bismuth,\r\nimparts a permanent golden yellow colour to wool.\r\n\r\n  212. _The CARDOON_ (Cynara cardunculus) _is a species of artichoke which\r\n  grows wild in the south of France, and has smaller flowers than the\r\n  common artichoke, and the scales of the calyx terminated by long, sharp\r\n  spines._\r\n\r\n  _The stems rise to the height of four or five feet, and are upright,\r\n  thick, and cottony. The leaves are large and winged, and the flowers of\r\n  blue colour._\r\n\r\nThe parts of the cardoon that are eaten are not those belonging immediately\r\nto the flower, as of the artichoke, but the roots, stalks, and middle ribs\r\nof the leaves; and chiefly the latter, which are thick and crisp. But, as\r\nall these are naturally very bitter, the plants, previously to being used,\r\nare blanched, by being tied up like lettuces, about the month of September,\r\nand having earth thrown upon their lower parts, to the depth of eighteen\r\ninches or two feet.\r\n\r\nCardoons come into season for the table about the end of November; and are\r\neither eaten alone, or as a sauce to animal food, particularly to roasted\r\nmeat; or are introduced as a dish in the second course. They are, however,\r\nnot so much used in England as on the Continent; and this in consequence\r\nchiefly of the trouble attending their cultivation, and their preparation\r\nfor the table, so as to render them palatable.\r\n\r\n  213. _LETTUCE_ (Lactuca sativa) _is an esculent vegetable, that is\r\n  cultivated in nearly every kitchen garden in the kingdom._\r\n\r\nThe different kinds or varieties of lettuce are extremely numerous: but\r\nthose best known are the _cos lettuce_, and _cabbage lettuce_, the former\r\nhaving upright leaves, and the latter having its leaves folded over each\r\nother like those of a cabbage. Their culture is very simple. The seeds are\r\nsown at various seasons of the year, that the plants may be ready, in\r\nsuccession, for the table. After a while, they are planted out from the\r\nseed-bed into another part of the garden, at a certain distance from each\r\nother, to allow of room for their expansion and growth. When the cos\r\nlettuces have attained a sufficient size, their leaves are tied together\r\nwith strings of matting, to blanch them for use. From seeds that are sown\r\ntowards the end of summer, lettuces may, with care, be obtained in\r\nperfection during the ensuing winter and spring.\r\n\r\nLettuces have an odour somewhat resembling that of opium; and they also\r\npossess somewhat similar narcotic properties, which reside in the milky\r\njuice. The properties of this vegetable as a salad, if eaten without oil,\r\nare considered to be emollient, cooling, and wholesome.\r\n\r\n  214. _ENDIVE_ (Cichorium endivia) _is a common vegetable in kitchen\r\n  gardens, having curled or crisped leaves._\r\n\r\nWe are supposed to have been originally indebted to the East Indies for\r\nthis useful winter salad. It is chiefly cultivated in the south of England;\r\nbeing sown generally about June or July, and afterwards planted out, like\r\nlettuce.\r\n\r\nThe chief excellence of endive consists in the whiteness of its inner\r\nleaves. It is, therefore, adviseable, either to cover the plants with\r\nflower-pots, or, when full grown, to tie them loosely together, for two or\r\nthree weeks. By so doing, they will become perfectly blanched; and, in\r\nwinter, they may be preserved, either by covering them with straw and mats,\r\nor by putting them in sand in a dry cellar.\r\n\r\nThe French consume a great quantity of endive at their tables. They either\r\neat it raw in salads, boiled in ragouts, fried with roast meat, or as a\r\npickle. It is a wholesome vegetable which seldom disagrees with the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERFLUA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  215. _CAMOMILE_ (Anthemis nobilis) _is a well-known plant, the dried\r\n  daisy-like flowers of which are frequently used in medicine._\r\n\r\nThe principal use to which camomile _flowers_ are applied is to excite\r\nvomiting, and promote the operation of emetics. They have likewise\r\noccasionally been substituted for Peruvian bark, in the case of\r\nintermittent fevers or agues, particularly on the Continent, but not with\r\nmuch success; and are used as a valuable stomachic. Both the _leaves_ and\r\nflowers are employed in fomentations and poultices. They each, but\r\nparticularly the flowers, have a powerful, though not an unpleasant smell,\r\nand a bitter taste.\r\n\r\nThey are administered in substance, as a powder or electuary, in infusion\r\nas tea, in decoction or extract, or in the form of an essential oil\r\nobtained by distillation.\r\n\r\nSo fragrant is the camomile plant, that the places where it grows wild, on\r\nopen gravelly commons, may easily be discovered by the somewhat\r\nstrawberry-like perfume which is emitted by treading on them. This quality\r\nalone has sometimes induced the cultivation of camomile for a green walk in\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n  216. _TARRAGON_ (Artemisia dracunculus) _is a hardy plant of the wormwood\r\n  tribe, which grows wild in India and the southern parts of Europe, and is\r\n  cultivated with us in gardens for culinary uses._\r\n\r\n  _It has a somewhat shrubby stem; smooth, spear-shaped, leaves tapering at\r\n  each end; and flowers roundish, erect, and on footstalks._\r\n\r\nThis is a hot and bitter vegetable, which is sometimes eaten with lettuces,\r\nor other salad herbs: and sometimes used as an ingredient in soup. Its\r\n_seeds_ are pungent; and may be advantageously substituted for the more\r\ncostly spices obtained from the Indies. The Indians frequently eat the\r\n_leaves_ of the tarragon plant with bread.\r\n\r\nThe sauce called _tarragon vinegar_ is made by infusing for fourteen days,\r\none pound of the leaves of tarragon, gathered a short time before the\r\nflowers appear, in one gallon of the best vinegar: straining this through a\r\nflannel bag, and fining it by means of a little isinglass.\r\n\r\nA distilled water is sometimes prepared from the leaves of tarragon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUSTRANEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  217. _The JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE is a somewhat potatoe-shaped root, produced\r\n  by a species of sunflower_ (Helianthus tuberosus) _which grows wild in\r\n  several parts of South America._\r\n\r\n  _This plant bears single stalks, which are frequently eight or nine feet\r\n  high, and yellow flowers, much smaller than those of the common\r\n  sunflower._\r\n\r\nSo extremely productive are these valuable roots, that betwixt seventy and\r\neighty tons' weight of them are said to have been obtained, in one season,\r\nfrom a single acre of ground. They succeed in almost any soil; and, when\r\nonce planted, will continue to flourish in the same place, without\r\nrequiring either much manure, or much attention to the culture. The season\r\nin which they are dug up for use is from about the middle of September till\r\nNovember; when they are in greatest perfection. After that they may be\r\npreserved in sand, or under cover, for the winter.\r\n\r\nThe roots are generally eaten plain boiled; but they are sometimes served\r\nto table with white fricassee-sauce, and in other ways. Their flavour is so\r\nnearly like that of the common artichoke, that it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish them from each other. We are informed that Jerusalem artichokes\r\nare a valuable food for hogs and store pigs; and that if washed, cut, and\r\nground in a mill, similar to an apple-mill, they may also be given to\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n  218. _The COMMON or ANNUAL SUNFLOWER_ (Helianthus annuus) _is a Peruvian\r\n  plant, with large yellow flowers, that is well known in our gardens._\r\n\r\nThe uses to which this plant may be applied are such as to render it well\r\ndeserving of attention in rural economy. Its _stalks_ contain a white,\r\nshining, fibrous substance, which might be advantageously employed in the\r\nmanufacture of paper; and the woody part of them makes excellent fuel. Its\r\nripe _seeds_, when subjected to pressure, yield a great proportion of sweet\r\nand palatable oil. These seeds may also be used for the feeding of poultry.\r\nThe _receptacles of the flowers_, it is said, may be boiled and eaten like\r\nartichokes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XX.--GYNANDRIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDIANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  219. _SALEP is the powder of the dried roots of several well-known\r\n  field-plants of the orchis tribe_ (Orchis morio, O. mascula, &c.)\r\n\r\nAs an article of diet, salep is supposed to contain the largest portion of\r\nnutriment, in an equal compass, of any known vegetable production: even\r\narrow root (17) is, in this respect, inferior to it. The orchises from\r\nwhich it is manufactured flourish in great abundance in meadows and\r\npastures of several parts of England, flowering about the months of May and\r\nJune. As soon as the flower-stalks begin to decay, the roots should be dug\r\nup, and the newly-formed bulbs, which have then attained their perfect\r\nstate, should be separated. When several roots are collected, they should\r\nbe washed in water, and have their external skin removed by a small brush,\r\nor by dipping them in hot water, and rubbing them with a coarse linen\r\ncloth. The next process is to place them on a tin plate, and put them into\r\nan oven for about ten minutes, by which time they will have lost the milky\r\nwhiteness which they before possessed, and will have acquired a\r\ntransparency like horn. They are then to be spread in a room, where, in a\r\nfew days, they will become dry and hard.\r\n\r\nAlthough salep might be procured in great abundance in our own country, we\r\nimport nearly the whole of what we use from the Levant, and generally in\r\noval pieces of yellowish white colour, somewhat clear and pellucid, and of\r\nalmost horny substance. When these, or the powder prepared from them, are\r\nput into boiling water, they dissolve into a thick mucilage.\r\n\r\nWith the Turks, salep has great celebrity, on account of the restorative\r\nqualities which it is supposed to possess. It is much recommended as\r\nnutritive food for persons recovering from illness; and, in particular, as\r\na part of the stores of every ship about to sail into distant climates. It\r\nnot only possesses the property of yielding an invaluable nutriment, and,\r\nin a great measure, of concealing the saline taste of sea-water, but is\r\nlikewise of essential service against the sea-scurvy. When it is stated\r\nthat one ounce of this powder and an ounce of portable soup, dissolved in\r\ntwo quarts of boiling water, will form a jelly capable of affording\r\nsustenance to one man for a day, the utility of salep will be further seen\r\nas a means of preventing famine at sea for an infinitely longer time than\r\nany other food of equal bulk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XXI.--MONOECIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  220. _The BREAD FRUIT is a large globular berry of pale green colour,\r\n  about the size of a child's head, marked on the surface with irregular\r\n  six-sided depressions, and containing a white and somewhat fibrous pulp,\r\n  which, when ripe, becomes juicy and yellow._\r\n\r\n  _The tree that produces it_ (Artocarpus incisa, Fig. 57) _grows wild in\r\n  Otaheite and other islands of the South Seas, is about forty feet high,\r\n  has large and spreading branches, and large bright green leaves, each\r\n  deeply divided into seven or nine spear-shaped lobes._\r\n\r\nWe are informed, in Captain Cook's first voyage round the world, that the\r\nedible part of this fruit lies between the skin and the core; and that it\r\nis white as snow, and somewhat of the consistence of new bread. It is\r\ngenerally used immediately when gathered; if it be kept more than\r\ntwenty-four hours it becomes hard and chokey. The inhabitants of the South\r\nSea Islands prepare it as food, by dividing the fruit into three or four\r\nparts, and roasting it in hot embers. Its taste is insipid, with a slight\r\ntartness, and somewhat resembles that of the crumb of wheaten bread mixed\r\nwith Jerusalem artichoke (217). Of this fruit the Otaheitans make various\r\nmesses, by putting to it either water or the milk of the cocoa-nut (233),\r\nthen beating it to a paste with a stone pestle, and afterwards mixing it\r\nwith ripe plantains (270), bananas (271), or a sour paste, made from the\r\nbread fruit itself, called _mahié_.\r\n\r\nIt continues in season eight months of the year; and so great is its\r\nutility in the island of Otaheite, that (observes Captain Cook), if, in\r\nthose parts where it is not spontaneously produced, a man plant but ten\r\ntrees in his whole life-time, he will as completely fulfil his duty to his\r\nown and to future generations, as the natives of our less temperate climate\r\ncan do by ploughing in the winter's cold, and reaping in the summer's heat,\r\nas often as these seasons return; even if, after he has procured bread for\r\nhis present household, he should convert the surplus into money, and lay it\r\nup for his children.\r\n\r\nNot only does this tree supply food, but clothing, and numerous other\r\nconveniences of life. The _inner bark_, which is white, and composed of a\r\nnet-like series of fibres, is formed into a kind of cloth. The wood is\r\nsoft, smooth, and of yellowish colour; and is used for the building of\r\nboats and houses. In whatever part the tree is wounded, a glutinous milky\r\n_juice_ issues, which, when boiled with cocoa-nut oil (233), is employed\r\nfor making bird-lime, and as a cement for filling up cracks in such vessels\r\nas are intended for holding water. Some parts of the _flowers_ serve as\r\ntinder in the lighting of fire; and the leaves are used for wrapping up\r\nfood, and for other purposes.\r\n\r\nAs the climate of the South Sea Islands is considered not much to differ\r\nfrom that of the West Indies, it was (about thirty years ago) thought\r\ndesirable that some of the trees should be transferred, in a growing state,\r\nto our islands there. Consequently, his Majesty's ship the Bounty, in 1787,\r\nsailed for this purpose to the South Seas, under the command of Lieutenant,\r\nafterwards Admiral Bligh. But a fatal mutiny of the ship's crew prevented\r\nthe accomplishment of this benevolent design. The commander of the vessel,\r\nhowever, returned in safety to his country; and a second expedition under\r\nthe same person, and for the same purpose, was fitted out in the year 1791.\r\nCaptain Bligh arrived in safety at Otaheite, and, after an absence from\r\nEngland of about eighteen months, landed in Jamaica with 352 bread\r\nfruit-trees, in a living state, having left many others at different places\r\nin his passage thither. From Jamaica these trees were transferred to other\r\nislands; but the negroes, having a general and long established\r\npredilection for the plantain (270), the bread fruit is not much relished\r\nby them. Where, however, it has not been generally introduced as an article\r\nof food, it is used as a delicacy; and whether employed as bread, or in the\r\nform of pudding, it is considered highly palatable by the European\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n  221. _The JACK FRUIT is a species of bread fruit that is grown in Malabar\r\n  and other parts of the East Indies._\r\n\r\n  _The tree which produces this fruit_ (Artocarpus integrifolia) _differs\r\n  from the common bread fruit-tree, in having the leaves entire, each about\r\n  a span in length, oblong, blunt, serrated at the edges, bright green, and\r\n  very smooth on the upper surface, paler beneath, and clad with stiff\r\n  hairs._\r\n\r\nFew of the fruits even of eastern climates are so large as this. Its weight\r\nis sometimes upwards of thirty pounds; and it generally contains betwixt\r\ntwo and three hundred nuts or seeds. These are each about three times as\r\nlarge as an almond, of somewhat oval shape, blunt at one end, sharp at the\r\nother, and a little flatted on the sides. Some varieties of the fruit,\r\nhowever, contain no nuts.\r\n\r\nThe season in which the jack fruit is in perfection is about the month of\r\nDecember. Though esteemed by many persons, it is so difficult of digestion,\r\nthat great caution is requisite in eating it. The unripe fruit is sometimes\r\npickled; it is sometimes cut into slices, and boiled as a vegetable for the\r\ntable; and sometimes fried in palm-oil. The _nuts_ are eaten roasted, and\r\nthe _wood_ serves for building materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  222. _MAIZE, or INDIAN CORN_ (Zea mays, Fig. 58), _is a species of grain\r\n  much cultivated in America and other climates: the grains are of yellow\r\n  colour, somewhat shaped like flattened peas, and grow closely set round\r\n  the upper part of high perpendicular stalks._\r\n\r\nTo the inhabitants of many countries of warm climates the cultivation of\r\nmaize is a very important pursuit. These plants are propagated by sowing\r\nthe seed in rows, in March, April, or May: they generally produce two crops\r\nin the year, and yield, according to the soil, from fifteen to forty\r\nbushels per acre. As soon as they are ripe, the ears are gathered. They are\r\nshortly afterwards threshed, and the grain, when separated, is spread out\r\nto dry in the sun; for, if it were heaped together in this state, it would\r\nferment, and sprout or grow.\r\n\r\nThe American Indians parch this kind of corn over a fire, in such manner as\r\nnot to burn it. Afterwards they pound it, sift the meal and preserve it for\r\ntheir chief food. They make it into puddings and cakes, or bread, the\r\nquality of which is extremely nutritive. Maize is useful for poultry and\r\ncattle of every kind; and, if converted into malt, a wholesome beverage may\r\nbe brewed from it. Of the leafy _husk_ which surrounds the ear of the maize\r\na beautiful kind of writing paper is manufactured at a paper-mill near\r\nRimini in Italy; and a greyish paper may be manufactured from the whole\r\nplant. The _stalks_ are said to afford an excellent winter food for cattle.\r\nWhen the _young ears_ are beginning to form, they have a sweet and\r\nagreeable taste. If, in this state, the leaves be stripped off, and the\r\nears be subjected to pressure, a pleasant and palatable milky juice may be\r\nobtained from them.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that maize might, with advantage, be cultivated in England.\r\n\r\n  223. _The COMMON CUCUMBER_ (Cucumis sativus, Fig. 59.) _is an oblong,\r\n  rough, and cooling fruit, which is cultivated in our kitchen gardens, and\r\n  is supposed to have been originally imported into this country from some\r\n  part of the Levant._\r\n\r\nCucumbers are always eaten before they are ripe, and usually with vinegar,\r\noil, pepper, and salt. They are sometimes stewed; and when young (under the\r\nname of _gerkins_), are pickled with vinegar and spices, or preserved in\r\nsyrup as a sweetmeat.\r\n\r\nAs the cucumber plants are too tender to sustain the coldness of our\r\nclimate exposed to the open air, it is necessary to sow the seed in\r\nhot-beds, or under hand-glasses; though, in the beginning of summer, the\r\nglasses may, without danger, be removed. The fruit is much improved by\r\nputting a piece of slate or a tile under each, instead of allowing it to\r\nlie upon the naked ground.\r\n\r\n  224. _The COMMON MELON, or MUSK MELON, is a species of cucumber, produced\r\n  by a creeping herbaceous plant_ (Cucumis melo), _which has leaves with\r\n  rounded angles, and grows wild in Tartary._\r\n\r\nIn hot climates this fruit attains great perfection and a peculiarly fine\r\nflavour; and even in England, where it is cultivated in hot-beds, and\r\nsheltered by glass frames, it is one of the coolest and most delicious\r\nsummer fruits that we possess. Its size and form vary beyond description.\r\nSometimes it is smooth, and only three or four inches in length: sometimes\r\nits whole surface is rugged, or netted, and is many pounds in weight.\r\nMelons are, in colour, grey, yellowish, or green, externally; whilst their\r\nflesh is white, yellow, reddish, or green.\r\n\r\nThey are usually eaten with sugar; sometimes with pepper or ginger, and\r\nsalt; and sometimes alone. In France, they are often eaten as a sauce to\r\nboiled beef. The smaller kinds are pickled; and one particular sort of\r\nmelons are filled with mustard seeds and shred garlic, and pickled under\r\nthe name of _mangos_ (73).\r\n\r\nThe propagation of melons is by seed, sown in February or March; and the\r\ncultivation is somewhat similar to that of the cucumber, but is attended\r\nwith considerably more trouble and expense.\r\n\r\n  225. _The PUMPKIN, or POMPION, is a species of gourd which grows to an\r\n  enormous size, contains several cells, and numerous seeds with tumid\r\n  margins, and is produced by a creeping plant, with lobed leaves_\r\n  (Cucurbita pepo).\r\n\r\n  _The shape of the pumpkin is generally globular, or flatted at top and\r\n  bottom, and ribbed. The rind is glossy, and of yellow or green colour.\r\n  The flesh is firm, but melting, and the whole weight is sometimes more\r\n  than thirty pounds._\r\n\r\nThe Germans cultivate this plant in extensive fields, for various\r\neconomical purposes, but particularly for the feeding of swine, and other\r\nanimals. They cut it into pieces, and throw it into fish-ponds, as food for\r\ncarp. Little trouble is required in its culture; and it will flourish on\r\nany tolerable soil, in a warm and sheltered situation. The pulp is served\r\nat table in various forms, but particularly in pies, and as an ingredient\r\nin puddings and pancakes. The Americans frequently gather pumpkins when\r\nhalf grown, and eat them boiled as a sauce to meat. If the _seeds_ be\r\nsubjected to pressure, they will yield a proportion of oil so great as\r\nnearly to amount to their own weight; and, when ground with water, they\r\nafford a cooling and nutritious kind of milk.\r\n\r\n  226. _The BOTTLE GOURD is an American fruit with woody rind, and of very\r\n  various shape, belonging to the same tribe as the pumpkin, and produced\r\n  by a creeping plant_ (Cucurbita lagenaria) _with somewhat angular and\r\n  downy leaves, each having two glands at the base underneath._\r\n\r\nThis fruit is at first green, but when ripe, it assumes a dull yellow\r\ncolour; and the flesh is spongy and very white. Its size and shape are so\r\nvaried, that it would be impossible to describe them; sometimes it has a\r\nlong slender part next the stalk, like the neck of a bottle; sometimes it\r\nis swollen, and sometimes of great length, and of form so curved as to be\r\nshaped almost like a bugle horn, or the musical instrument called a\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\nSo hard and strong is the _rind_ of the bottle-gourd, that this, when freed\r\nfrom the pulp, is frequently converted by the Americans, as well as the\r\ninhabitants of the West Indies, into drinking cups, flagons, bottles, and\r\nother domestic utensils; but, on being first used, it communicates a\r\ndisagreeable taste to the juices contained in it. The _pulp_, boiled with\r\nvinegar, is sometimes eaten.\r\n\r\n  227. _The WATER MELON_ (Cucurbita citrullus) _is a roundish or oblong\r\n  species of gourd, with thin smooth rind, marked with star-like spots, the\r\n  leaves deeply divided into lobes, and the flowers somewhat resembling\r\n  those of the cucumber._\r\n\r\nPersons who have visited hot climates know well how to appreciate the\r\ngrateful coolness and delicious flavour of the water melon, the flesh of\r\nwhich is so succulent that it melts in the mouth; and the central pulp of\r\nwhich is fluid, like that of the cocoa-nut, and may be sucked, or poured\r\nout through a hole in the rind, and thus made to afford a most refreshing\r\nbeverage.\r\n\r\nTo the inhabitants of Egypt, China, the East Indies, and other countries,\r\nwhere they are cultivated to a great extent, water melons are extremely\r\nvaluable, both as food and physic. They are allowed to be eaten in fevers,\r\nand other inflammatory complaints. Their flesh or pulp is, in general, of\r\nreddish colour; one kind, however, called by the French _pastèque_, has a\r\nwhitish green pulp. The latter are frequently pickled in vinegar, like\r\ngerkins; and are eaten in fricassees, or baked in sweet wine.\r\n\r\nBoth these varieties may be grown in our gardens, under hot-bed frames, in\r\nthe same manner as cucumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTETRANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  228. _The BIRCH_ (Betula alba) _is a forest-tree, easily known by the\r\n  smooth appearance and silvery colour of its bark, by its leaves being\r\n  somewhat triangular, but acute, their smallness in comparison with those\r\n  of other timber trees, and by the small branches being slender and\r\n  flexible._\r\n\r\nAlthough the birch is by no means considered a valuable timber tree, yet\r\nits _wood_ is used for numerous purposes. Being of white colour, and firm\r\nand tough in texture, it is variously employed by hoop-benders and\r\nwheel-wrights. Turners use it for trenchers, bowls, ladles, and other\r\nwooden ware. Ox yokes, small screws, women's shoe-heels, pattens, and, in\r\nFrance, wooden shoes are made of it. The North American Indians use the\r\nwood of the birch-tree for canoes, boxes, buckets, baskets, kettles, and\r\ndishes, curiously joining it together with threads made of roots of the\r\ncedar-tree. Birch-trees are not unfrequently planted with hazels, for the\r\npurpose of the wood being converted into charcoal for forges. This charcoal\r\nis much esteemed; and the soot which is formed on burning the wood\r\nconstitutes a good black substance for printers' ink.\r\n\r\nNearly all the other parts of the birch-tree are applicable to useful\r\npurposes. The inhabitants of Sweden employ the _bark_ in the tanning of\r\nleather; and, after burning it to a certain degree, they also use it as a\r\ncement for broken china and earthen ware. The navigators of the river Volga\r\nconstruct of it portable boats, cradles, &c. It is serviceable in dyeing a\r\nyellow colour. In Norway it is dried, ground, mixed with meal, and boiled\r\nwith other food for swine. Houses or huts, in many parts of the north of\r\nEurope, are covered with the outward and thicker part of the bark, instead\r\nof slates, or tiles. It is spun into a coarse kind of rope, woven into\r\nshoes and hats; and, in Kamschatka, even made into drinking cups. The\r\nLaplanders fasten together large pieces of it as outer garments to keep off\r\nthe rain. Abounding with much resinous matter, slices of the bark are\r\nsometimes twisted together to make torches. During a scarcity of corn the\r\nbark of the birch-tree has, in several instances, been ground with bread\r\ncorn, and successfully used as food by mankind.\r\n\r\nIn most parts of England the _twigs_ of this tree are made into besoms.\r\nThey are also made into the tops of fishing rods; and, when smeared with\r\nbird-lime (56), are used by bird-catchers. The Norwegians frequently employ\r\nthem as fodder for their horses. The _leaves_ afford a yellow dye.\r\n\r\nA wholesome wine is made from the _sap_ or juice of the birch-tree. The\r\njuice is obtained by boring holes in the trunks of the trees, about the\r\nbeginning of March, before the leaves appear. Into each of these holes a\r\npiece of elder stick, hollowed through the middle, by clearing out the\r\npith, is placed. This conducts the juice, as it flows from the wound, into\r\na vessel put to receive it. If a tree be large, it may be tapped in four or\r\nfive places at once; and, from several trees, many gallons of juice may be\r\nobtained in a day. The juice thus procured is to be boiled with sugar, in\r\nthe proportion of four pounds to a gallon, and treated in the same manner\r\nas other made wines. A good spirit might no doubt be obtained from the\r\njuice of the birch-tree by distillation.\r\n\r\n  229. _The ALDER, or OWLER_ (Betula alnus, Fig. 63), _is a tree which\r\n  grows in wet situations, and is distinguished by its flower-stalks being\r\n  branched, and its leaves being roundish, waved, serrated, and downy at\r\n  the branching of the veins beneath._\r\n\r\nThere are few means of better employing swampy and morassy grounds than by\r\nplanting them with alders; for although the growth of these trees is not\r\nrapid, the uses to which they are applicable are such as amply to repay the\r\nloss of time requisite before they come to perfection.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the alder, which is in great demand for machinery, is\r\nfrequently wrought into cogs for mill-wheels, and is peculiarly adapted for\r\nall kinds of work which are to be constantly kept in water. It is\r\nconsequently used for pumps, sluices, pipes, drains, and conduits of\r\ndifferent description, and for the foundation of buildings situated in\r\nswamps. The water pipes which are laid under the streets of many of our\r\nlarge towns are made of alder; and, for its utility in the formation of\r\nsluices, it is much cultivated in Holland. It is commonly used for bobbins;\r\nand women's shoe-heels, ploughmen's clogs, and numerous articles of turnery\r\nware, are formed of it. This wood serves also for many domestic and rural\r\nuses, for spinning-wheels, troughs, the handles of tools, ladders,\r\ncart-wheels; and, as coppice wood, it is planted to be cut down every ninth\r\nor tenth year, for poles. The roots and knots furnish a beautifully veined\r\nwood, nearly of the colour of mahogany; and well adapted for cabinet work\r\nand furniture.\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ may be advantageously used in the operations of tanning and\r\nleather-dressing; and by fishermen, for staining their nets. This, and the\r\nyoung twigs, are sometimes employed in dyeing, and yield different shades\r\nof yellow and red. The Laplanders chew the bark of the alder, and dye their\r\nleather garments red with the saliva thus produced. With the addition of\r\ncopperas, it yields a black dye, which the dyers of cotton use to\r\nconsiderable extent; and, for this purpose, it is purchaseable in some\r\ncountries, at the rate of seven pence or eight pence per stone.\r\n\r\nIn the highlands of Scotland, we are informed that _young branches_ of the\r\nalder, cut down in the summer, spread over the fields, and left during the\r\nwinter to decay, are found to answer the purpose of manure. The fresh\r\ngathered _leaves_, being covered with a glutinous moisture, are said to be\r\nsometimes strewed upon floors to destroy fleas, which become entangled in\r\nit, as birds are with bird-lime. But these agile and troublesome insects\r\nmust be numerous indeed to render the setting of traps for them of any\r\navail towards their destruction.\r\n\r\n  230. _The COMMON NETTLE. There are two kinds of nettle common in England,\r\n  one of which_ (Urtica dioica) _has heart-shaped leaves, and the other_\r\n  (Urtica urens) _has oval leaves._\r\n\r\nAlthough generally considered a noxious weed, the nettle is a plant of\r\nextensive utility. By the country people the young and tender _leaves_ and\r\n_tops_ are boiled for food, and are eaten as a substitute for greens and\r\nother pot-herbs. Asses eagerly devour the leaves of nettles; and if these\r\nbe boiled, and mixed with other food for poultry, they are said to promote\r\ntheir laying of eggs. A kind of rennet is made in the Highlands of\r\nScotland, by adding a quart of salt to three pints of a liquor produced by\r\nthe boiling of nettles. A tablespoonful of this is said to be sufficient to\r\ncoagulate a bowl of milk. From the fibrous _stalks_ of the nettle, dressed\r\nin the manner of flax or hemp, cloth and paper may be made. The manufacture\r\nof these has been pursued with success in some parts of the Continent; and\r\nin our own country a coarse kind of canvass has been produced from them.\r\nThe _roots_, when boiled, communicate a yellow colour to woollen cloth,\r\nlinen, and cotton.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked that the _stings_ of nettles, when examined by a\r\nmicroscope, are shown to be extremely curious objects. They consist of a\r\nslender, tapering, sharp, and hollow substance, with a minute hole at the\r\npoint, and a bag at the base. When the sting is pressed, it perforates the\r\nskin, and the same pressure forces up from the bag, into the wound, a\r\ncorrosive liquor, which forms there a blister, and excites a burning and\r\npainful inflammation. If the nettle be suddenly and strongly grasped, the\r\nstings are bent or broken, and, in this case, occasion no pain.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of their stinging quality, nettles have been employed, with\r\nadvantage, in restoring sensation to paralytic limbs, by whipping them with\r\nthese plants. They were formerly much used as a styptic; and are said to\r\nhave been found useful in jaundice, scurvy, gout, and other complaints; but\r\nmost of the accounts that have been given of their great medicinal virtues\r\nhave now little credit. The _flowers_ and _seeds_ are said to have been\r\ntried in Italy, and found an efficacious substitute for Peruvian bark (62)\r\nin agues and other complaints. A leaf of the nettle put upon the tongue,\r\nand then pressed against the roof of the mouth, is stated to be a remedy\r\nfor bleeding at the nose.\r\n\r\n  231. _The MULBERRY-TREE_ (Morus nigra, Fig. 72) _is a native of Italy,\r\n  and is known by its heart-shaped and rough leaves, and its large juicy\r\n  berries, each consisting of several smaller ones._\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the mulberry appear in June, and the _fruit_ becomes ripe in\r\nSeptember, the berries continuing to ripen in succession for about two\r\nmonths. These, if eaten before they are ripe, are astringent; but, when\r\nripe, are pleasantly acid, though of very peculiar flavour. An agreeable\r\nsyrup, made from the _juice_ of the ripe fruit, is kept in apothecaries'\r\nshops for medicinal uses. The juice itself is employed to impart a dark\r\ntinge to liquors and confections; and, when properly fermented, it becomes\r\na pleasant wine. In cider counties it is not unusual to mix mulberries with\r\nthe apples destined for cider, by which is made a delicious beverage called\r\n_mulberry cider_. Mulberries stain the fingers, as well as linen, cotton,\r\nor woollen, of a red colour, which is difficult to be extracted; but which\r\nmay be removed by verjuice, or the acid of lemons.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, and other countries where silkworms are bred, the _leaves_ of the\r\nmulberry-tree, but particularly those of the WHITE MULBERRY, which is\r\ndistinguished by its having obliquely heart-shaped and smooth leaves, are\r\nrequisite for the feeding of these insects; and they are very extensively\r\ncultivated for this purpose. The _wood_ is hard and of yellow colour; and\r\nis applied to numerous uses in carving and turnery. The _bark_ is so\r\nfibrous that it may be manufactured into cordage, ropes, and coarse paper;\r\nand that of the root has an acrid and bitter taste, is powerful in its\r\neffects, and has been successfully used as a remedy against worms,\r\nparticularly the tape-worm. Mulberry-trees flourish best in a light and\r\nrich soil, and in open situations.\r\n\r\n  232. _The BOX-TREE_ (Buxus sempervirens) _is a shrubby evergreen tree,\r\n  twelve or fifteen feet high, which has small, oval, and opposite leaves,\r\n  and grows wild in several parts of Britain._\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that this tree was formerly so common in some parts of\r\nEngland, as to have given name to several places, particularly to Box-hill\r\nin Surrey, and Boxley in Kent; and, in 1815, there were cut down at\r\nBox-hill as many of these trees as were sold for upwards of 10,000_l._, a\r\ncircumstance perhaps unparalleled in their history. The box-tree was much\r\nadmired by the ancient Romans, and also by our own ancestors, on account of\r\nits being easily clipped into the form of animals, and other fantastic\r\nshapes. In the South of Europe it is cultivated in gardens, and kept in\r\nflower-pots, with as much attention as we bestow upon myrtles.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ is of yellowish colour, close-grained, very hard and heavy, and\r\nadmits of a beautiful polish. On these accounts it is much used by turners,\r\nby engravers on wood, carvers, and mathematical instrument makers. Flutes\r\nand other wind instruments are formed of it; and furniture made of box-wood\r\nwould be valuable were it not too heavy, as it would not only be very\r\nbeautiful, but its bitter quality would secure it from the attacks of\r\ninsects. In France it is much in demand for combs, knife-handles, and\r\nbutton-moulds; and it has been stated that the quantity of box-wood\r\nannually sent from Spain to Paris is alone estimated at the value of more\r\nthan 10,000 livres.\r\n\r\nAn oil distilled from the shavings of box-wood has been found to relieve\r\nthe tooth-ache, and to be useful in other complaints; and the powdered\r\n_leaves_ destroy worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  233. _The COCOA-NUT is a woody fruit, produced in nearly all the\r\n  countries of hot climates; of oval shape, from three or four, to six or\r\n  eight inches in length, covered with a fibrous husk, and lined internally\r\n  with a white, firm, and fleshy kernel._\r\n\r\n  _The tree_ (Cocos nucifera) _which produces the cocoa-nut is a kind of\r\n  palm, from forty to sixty feet high. It has, on its summit only, a kind\r\n  of leaves, which appear almost like immense feathers, each fourteen or\r\n  fifteen feet long, three feet broad, and winged. Of these the upper ones\r\n  are erect, the middle ones horizontal, and the lower ones drooping. The\r\n  trunk is straight, naked, and marked with the scars of the fallen leaves.\r\n  The nuts hang down from the summit of the tree, in clusters of a dozen or\r\n  more together._\r\n\r\nThe external rind of the cocoa-nut has a smooth surface, and is of somewhat\r\ntriangular shape. This encloses an extremely fibrous substance of\r\nconsiderable thickness, which immediately surrounds the nut. The latter has\r\na thick and hard shell, with three holes at the base, each closed by a\r\nblack membrane. The kernel lines the shell; and is sometimes nearly an inch\r\nin thickness, and encloses a considerable quantity of watery liquid, of\r\nwhitish colour, which has the name of _milk_.\r\n\r\nFood, clothing, and the means of shelter and protection, are all afforded\r\nby the cocoa-nut-tree. The kernels of the _nuts_, which somewhat resemble\r\nthe filbert in taste, but are of much firmer consistence, are used as food\r\nin various modes of dressing, and sometimes are cut into pieces and dried.\r\nWhen pressed in a mill, they yield an oil, which, in some countries, is the\r\nonly oil used at table; and which, when fresh, is equal in quality to that\r\nof almonds. It, however, soon becomes rancid, and, in this state, is\r\nprincipally used by painters. The Indians prepare an oil from cocoa-nuts,\r\nby steeping the kernels in water till they putrefy, and then boiling the\r\npulp. In this operation the oil rises to the surface, and is skimmed off.\r\nThis oil is used for anointing the hair, in cookery, for burning in lamps,\r\nand for various other purposes. The _milk_, or fluid, contained in the\r\nnuts, is an exceedingly cool and agreeable beverage, which, when good,\r\nsomewhat resembles the kernel in flavour.\r\n\r\nCocoa-nut-trees flourish best in a sandy soil, and first produce fruit when\r\nsix or seven years old; after which each tree yields from fifty to a\r\nhundred nuts annually.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous coats or _husks_ which envelope the cocoa-nuts, after they have\r\nbeen soaked for some time in water, become soft. They are then beaten, to\r\nfree them from the other substances with which they are intermixed, and\r\nwhich fall away like saw-dust, the stringy part only being left. This is\r\nspun into long yarns, woven into sail-cloth, and twisted into ropes and\r\ncables, even for large vessels. The cordage thus manufactured is valuable\r\nin several respects, but particularly for the advantages that are derived\r\nfrom its floating in water. The woody _shells_ of the nut are so hard as to\r\nbe capable of receiving a high polish; and they are formed into drinking\r\ncups, and other domestic utensils, which are sometimes expensively mounted\r\nin silver.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of the cocoa-nut-tree the tender _leaves_, at their first\r\nspringing up, are folded over each other, so as somewhat to resemble a\r\ncabbage. These are occasionally eaten in place of culinary greens, and are\r\na very delicious food; but, as they can only be obtained by the destruction\r\nof the tree that produces them, and which dies in consequence of their\r\nbeing removed, they are considered too expensive a treat for frequent use.\r\nThe larger leaves are employed for the thatching of buildings, and are\r\nwrought into baskets, brooms, mats, sacks, hammocks, and many other useful\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nThe _trunks_ are made into boats, and sometimes constitute timber for the\r\nconstruction of houses; and, when their central pith is cleared away, they\r\nform excellent gutters for the conveyance of water. If, whilst growing, the\r\nbody of the tree be bored, a white and sweetish liquor exudes from the\r\nwound, which has the name of _toddy_. This is collected in vessels of\r\nearthen-ware, and is a favourite beverage in many countries where the trees\r\ngrow. When fresh it is very sweet; in a few hours it becomes somewhat acid,\r\nand, in this state, is peculiarly agreeable; but in the space of\r\ntwenty-four hours it is complete vinegar. By distillation this liquor\r\nyields an ardent spirit, which is sometimes called _rack_, or _arrack_; and\r\nis more esteemed than that obtained by distillation from rice or sugar, and\r\nmerely fermented and flavoured with the cocoa-nut juice. If boiled with\r\nquick-lime, it thickens into a syrup, which is used by confectioners in the\r\nEast Indies, though it is much inferior to syrup produced from the\r\nsugarcane.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  234. _The COMMON ARUM, CUCKOO PINT, or LORDS AND LADIES_ (Arum\r\n  maculatum), _is a well-known plant, which grows in shady hedge bottoms;\r\n  and has, about the month of May, a club-shaped spike, frequently of\r\n  purple colour at the top, issuing from a green sheath with which it is\r\n  enveloped._\r\n\r\nThe acridity of every part of this common plant, whilst in a recent state,\r\nis such that, if tasted, there is left upon the tongue an intolerably\r\ndisagreeable burning and pricking sensation, which continues for a long\r\ntime afterwards; and which no one, who has once tasted it, will be inclined\r\nto experience a second time. If bruised and applied to the skin, a blister\r\nwill shortly afterwards be raised.\r\n\r\nIt was from this property that the _roots_, which are whitish, and each\r\nabout the size of a nutmeg, were formerly used internally in medicine, as a\r\npowerful stimulant, and externally for blisters. In some parts of France\r\nthey are employed in bleaching, from an opinion that, by their corrosive\r\nquality, they render the linen white. Their acrimony is wholly dissipated\r\nby drying; and, in a dried state, they afford an almost tasteless\r\nfarinaceous powder, which may even be made into bread. The powdered roots\r\nof the common arum are converted, by the French, into an harmless cosmetic,\r\nwhich is sold at a high price under the name of _Cyprus powder_.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a premium which was offered by the Society for\r\nEncouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, for discovering a method\r\nof preparing starch from materials not used as food for man, an experiment\r\nwas made, by Mrs. Jane Gibbs, of Portland, in Dorsetshire, upon the roots\r\nof the common arum. A peck of the roots was found to produce about four\r\npounds' weight of starch; and she prepared, in the whole, about two hundred\r\nweight. The process was to clean the roots, and pound them in a mortar with\r\nwater: the pulp thus formed was strained, and after being allowed to\r\nsettle, the water was poured off, and the starch remained at the bottom.\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking of the arum, it may be stated that the flowers of some of\r\nthe foreign species (_Arum crinitum_ and _A. dracunculus_) have so strong a\r\nsmell, like carrion, that even flesh-flies are attracted to deposit their\r\neggs in them: and that the structure of the flowers is such that, when the\r\ninsects attempt to retreat, they are prevented by the reversed hairs which\r\nare there found, and are destroyed. Some of the species are considered\r\nwholesome food; one (_Arum esculentum_) is much cultivated for this purpose\r\nin the West Indies and South America. The leaves of this plant, when\r\nboiled, are much esteemed as potherbs, and the roots are eaten either baked\r\nor boiled.\r\n\r\n  235. _The SWEET CHESNUT_ (Fagus castanea, Fig. 65) _is a stately tree,\r\n  which grows wild in some of the southern and western parts of England,\r\n  and is distinguished by having spear-shaped and pointed leaves, with\r\n  tapering serratures at the edge._\r\n\r\n  _The flowers appear in long hanging spikes or clusters, about the month\r\n  of May; and the fruit, which is ripe in September, is enveloped in a husk\r\n  defended by a great number of complicated prickles._\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the known durability of the oak, there does not appear any\r\nwell-authenticated instance of the age of an oak being equal to that of the\r\ncelebrated chesnut-tree, at Tortworth, in Gloucestershire, which was known\r\nas a boundary mark in the reign of King John. This tree is supposed to have\r\nthen been more than 500 years old, making its age at this time to exceed\r\n1100 years. The diameter of its trunk is fifteen feet, and it still\r\ncontinues to bear fruit.\r\n\r\nFew of our forest trees are more beautiful than the chesnut. It is true\r\nthat the generality of painters prefer the oak for its picturesque form;\r\nbut in the landscapes of Salvator Rosa, and other celebrated masters,\r\nchesnut-trees are very conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe _timber_ of this tree was formerly much in use. The beams and rafters\r\nof many of our most ancient churches are formed of it; and its appearance\r\nso nearly resembles that of the oak, that it requires the eye of a good\r\njudge to distinguish them from each other. For the heads and staves of\r\ncasks, the wood of the chesnut is considered peculiarly excellent; and\r\npipes, made of it for the conveyance of water under ground, are said to be\r\nmore durable than those either of elm or oak. For furniture it may be\r\nstained so as somewhat to resemble mahogany. Hop-poles, and poles for\r\nespaliers and dead fences, made of young chesnut-trees, are preferred to\r\nmost others.\r\n\r\nMuch of the _fruit_ of the chesnut is consumed as food by the poorer\r\nclasses of people on the Continent, but particularly by those of Spain and\r\nItaly; and, when dried and powdered, it is no mean substitute for flour, in\r\nbread and puddings. Chesnuts are imported into this country in considerable\r\nquantities, both from France and Spain, and are roasted and eaten in\r\ndesserts: those which are grown here being much smaller than what we\r\nreceive from abroad. On the Continent they are sometimes used for making\r\nstarch, and in the bleaching of linen.\r\n\r\n  236. _The BEECH_ (Fagus sylvatica, Fig. 64) _is a forest tree known by\r\n  its waved and somewhat oval leaves, and its triangular fruit, consisting\r\n  of three cells, and enclosed, by pairs, in a husk which is covered with\r\n  simple prickles._\r\n\r\nThere are beech woods in many parts of England, but the trees flourish best\r\nin rich, calcareous soils. These woods, it has been observed, are\r\npeculiarly dry and pleasant to walk in; and, under their shade, afford to\r\nthe botanist many interesting plants, such as the bird's nest\r\n(_monotropa_), winter green (_pyrola_), and some rare _orchideæ_.\r\nBeech-trees bear lopping well, and may be trained so as to form lofty\r\nhedges, which are the more valuable for shelter, as the leaves, though\r\nfaded, remain through the winter, and the twisted branches may be formed\r\ninto a very strong fence.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ is hard and brittle, and, if exposed to the air, is liable soon\r\nto decay. It is, however, peculiarly useful to cabinet-makers and turners.\r\nCarpenters' planes, tool-handles, and mallets, are made of it. When split\r\ninto thin layers, it is used to make scabbards for swords. Chairs,\r\nbedsteads, and other furniture, are occasionally formed of beech.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of this tree, which has the name of _beech-mast_, and is ripe in\r\nSeptember, is palatable to the taste; but, if eaten in great quantity, it\r\noccasions giddiness and head-aches. When, however, it is dried and\r\npowdered, it may be made into a wholesome bread. The inhabitants of Scio,\r\none of the Ionian Islands, were once enabled to endure a memorable siege by\r\nthe beech-mast which their island supplied. This fruit has, occasionally,\r\nbeen roasted and used as a substitute for coffee. When subjected to\r\npressure, it yields a sweet and palatable _oil_, which, if properly made,\r\nis equal, in quality, to the best olive-oil, and has the advantage of\r\ncontinuing longer than that without becoming rancid. Beech-oil is\r\nmanufactured in several parts of France; and is used by the lower classes\r\nof Silesia instead of butter. The cakes which remain after the oil is\r\nextracted are a wholesome food, and may also be advantageously employed for\r\nthe fattening of swine, poultry, and oxen.\r\n\r\nIn some countries the _leaves_ of the beech-tree are collected in the\r\nautumn, before they have been injured, by the frosts, and are used instead\r\nof feathers for beds; and mattresses formed of them are said to be\r\npreferable to those either of straw or chaff.\r\n\r\n  237. _The OAK_ (Quercus robur, Fig. 68) _is a well-known timber tree, of\r\n  native growth in this country, as well as other countries in northern\r\n  temperate climates._\r\n\r\nIt is to this valuable tree that our navy is indebted for its existence;\r\nand without it this invincible barrier of the country could not be\r\nsupported. _Oak timber_ being hard, tough, tolerably flexible, and not very\r\nliable to splinter, is, in Europe, preferred to every other kind for the\r\nconstruction of ships of war. It is also well adapted to every purpose of\r\nrural and domestic economy, particularly for staves, laths, and the spokes\r\nof wheels. Until the introduction of mahogany, it was very generally used\r\nfor furniture; and, in large mansions, it was customary even to line the\r\nwalls of rooms with _wainscot_, or panelling of oak.\r\n\r\nThis tree is remarkable for the slowness of its growth, for its great\r\nlongevity, and the dimensions to which it attains. It has, however, been\r\nremarked that the trunk of the oak seldom increases to a greater\r\nproportionate diameter than about fourteen inches in eighty years. As to\r\nits dimensions, it is stated that an oak belonging to Lord Powis, and\r\ngrowing, in 1764, in Bromfield Wood, near Ludlow, measured sixty-eight feet\r\nin girth and twenty-three feet in height, and contained in the whole 1455\r\nfeet of timber.\r\n\r\nBefore oak timber is in a state to be used it is requisite that the trees\r\nshould be barked, and suffered to stand uncut for three or four years, that\r\nthey may become perfectly dry. The _bark_ thus obtained is extensively used\r\nin the tanning of leather; and afterwards it serves as fuel, and for making\r\nhot-beds for the growth of pines, and some other plants. The astringent\r\nproperties of oak-bark render it of use for medical purposes. The\r\n_saw-dust_ of this tree, and even the _leaves_, though much inferior to the\r\nbark, have been found useful in tanning. The former of these is the\r\nprincipal vegetable production of this country, which is used in the dyeing\r\nof fustian.\r\n\r\nOn the leaves and buds of the oak certain excrescences are formed, in\r\nconsequence of the puncture of insects, as the lodgment for their eggs and\r\na habitation for their future young. These are termed _galls_, and if, when\r\narrived at a certain state, they are infused in a weak solution of vitriol,\r\nthey impart to it a purple or violet tinge; and, after the whole colouring\r\nmatter is extracted, this becomes perfectly black. Considerable quantities\r\nof galls are used in dyeing, and for other purposes.\r\n\r\n_Acorns_, or the seeds of the oak, possess an astringent quality, and have\r\na bitter taste, both of which may be extracted by steeping them, for some\r\ntime, in cold water, or by boiling them. After this simple process, they\r\nare not an unpalatable fruit. With the ancient Britons they were an article\r\nin great request, and even constituted an important part of their food; and\r\nthere can be little doubt that, carefully prepared, dried, and reduced to\r\npowder, they might, in times of scarcity, be adopted as a substitute for\r\nbread-corn. By pressure an oil is obtained from them which may be used for\r\nlamps; and a kind of coffee is prepared from them in some parts of the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nThe branches of the oak, as well as those of several other kinds of trees,\r\nare burned for the formation of _charcoal_; and it is a remarkable\r\ncircumstance that the properties of charcoal, from whatever wood it may be\r\nmade, are nearly the same. One of the most remarkable of these is, that it\r\nis not liable to decay by age. Hence it was customary, with the ancients,\r\nto char or burn the outside of stakes, or other wood, which were to be\r\ndriven into the ground, or placed in water. Charcoal may be preserved\r\nwithout injury for an almost indefinite length of time; and, in the ancient\r\ntombs of the inhabitants of northern nations, entire pieces of charcoal are\r\nat this day frequently discovered.\r\n\r\nBesides the great use of charcoal in the composition of gunpowder, and to\r\nartists and manufacturers of different kinds, it has lately been employed,\r\nwith considerable success, in correcting the rancid and disagreeable smell\r\nof train oil, so as to render it fit to be burned in chamber lamps; and\r\nseveral manufactories of this oil have been established in the\r\nneighbourhood of London. Newly-made charcoal, if rolled up in clothes which\r\nhave contracted a disagreeable odour, will effectually destroy it; and if\r\nboiled with meat beginning to putrefy will take away the taint.\r\n\r\nThis substance is used by artists in the polishing of brass and\r\ncopper-plates, for the drawing of outlines, and numerous other purposes.\r\nWhen purified, it forms perhaps the best tooth-powder that is known. The\r\nmode of purifying it is to reduce it to powder, wash it repeatedly with\r\nwater, and then dry it by means of a strong heat in close vessels. This\r\nheat expels the foreign contents with which it is impregnated; but however\r\nintense, if the vessels are closed, it in no respects alters the quality of\r\nthe charcoal. The vapour of burning charcoal is extremely pernicious; and\r\npersons exposed to it in confined rooms are liable to be suffocated in a\r\nvery short time. The best remedy is immediately to take them into the\r\nstrongest draught of cold air that can be obtained, to loosen all their\r\ngarments, and apply volatile spirits to their nostrils.\r\n\r\n  238. _CORK is the external bark of a species of oak_ (Quercus suber)\r\n  _which grows in Spain, Portugal, and other southern parts of Europe, and\r\n  is distinguished by the fungous texture of its bark; and by its leaves\r\n  being evergreen, oblong, somewhat oval, downy underneath, and waved._\r\n\r\nThe principal supply of the cork that is consumed in Europe, is obtained\r\nfrom Catalonia in Spain; and the culture and the preparation of it yield to\r\nthe inhabitants of that province near 250,000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nIn the collecting of cork, it is customary to slit it with a knife, at\r\ncertain distances, in a perpendicular direction from the top of the trees\r\nto the bottom; and to make two incisions across, one near the top and the\r\nother near the bottom of the trunk. For the purpose of stripping off the\r\nbark, a curved knife with a handle at each end is used. Sometimes it is\r\nstripped in pieces the whole length, and sometimes in shorter pieces, cross\r\ncuts being made at certain intervals. In some instances the perpendicular\r\nand transverse incisions are made, and the cork is left upon the trees\r\nuntil, by the growth of the new bark beneath, it becomes sufficiently loose\r\nto be removed by the hand.\r\n\r\nAfter the pieces are detached they are soaked in water; and, when nearly\r\ndry, are placed over a fire of coals, which blackens their external\r\nsurface. By the latter operation they are rendered smooth, and all the\r\nsmaller blemishes are thereby concealed: the larger holes and cracks are\r\nfilled up by the artful introduction of soot and dirt. The pieces are next\r\nloaded with weights to make them even; and lastly they are dried, stacked,\r\nor packed in bales for exportation.\r\n\r\nMany of the uses of cork were well known to the ancients. Its elasticity\r\nrenders it peculiarly serviceable for the stopping of vessels of different\r\nkinds; and thus preventing either the liquids therein contained from\r\nrunning out, or the external air from passing in. The use of cork for\r\nstopping glass bottles is generally considered to have been introduced\r\nabout the fifteenth century. The practice of employing this substance for\r\njackets to assist in swimming is very ancient; and it has lately been\r\napplied in various ways towards the preservation of life, when endangered\r\nby shipwreck. The floats of nets used for fishing are frequently made of\r\ncork: pieces fastened together make buoys, which, by floating on the\r\nsurface of the water, afford direction for vessels in harbours, rivers, and\r\nother places. In some parts of Spain it is customary to line the walls of\r\nhouses with cork, which not only renders them warm, but prevents the\r\nadmission of moisture. The ancient Egyptians sometimes made coffins of it.\r\nOn account of its lightness, cork is used for false legs; and, from its\r\nbeing impervious by water, it is sometimes placed betwixt the soles of\r\nshoes to keep out moisture. When burned, it constitutes that light black\r\nsubstance known by the name of _Spanish black_.\r\n\r\nIn the cutting of corks for use, the only tool employed is a broad, thin,\r\nand sharp knife; and, as the cork tends very much to blunt this, it is\r\nsharpened upon a board by one whet, or stroke on each side, after every\r\ncut; and, now and then, upon a common whet-stone. The corks for bottles are\r\ncut in the length way of the bark, and consequently the pores lie across.\r\nBungs, and corks of large size, are cut in a contrary direction: the pores\r\nin these are therefore downward, a circumstance which renders them much\r\nmore defective in stopping out the air than the others. The parings of cork\r\nare sold to the makers of Spanish black.\r\n\r\n  239. _The WALNUT is a well-known shell fruit, produced by a tree_\r\n  (Juglans regia, Fig. 69), _which grows wild in the northern parts of\r\n  China and Persia, and has winged leaves; the leaflets, about nine in\r\n  number, large, oblong, smooth, thick; and the end one with a stalk._\r\n\r\nAlthough greatly admired, both for the beauty of its foliage, and for the\r\nexcellence of its fruit, the cultivation of the walnut-tree in England is\r\nby no means attended to so much as it was formerly, when its _wood_ was\r\nconsidered the most ornamental timber produced in our island. It is\r\npleasingly veined, and admits of a fine polish, but its colour is much less\r\nrich than that of mahogany; and consequently, except for the making of\r\ngunstocks, it has, of late, been wholly superseded by that more favourite\r\nwood. On the Continent, however, the walnut-tree is still in request for\r\nfurniture of various kinds.\r\n\r\nThe _fruit_ of the walnut-tree is covered externally with a thick and\r\nsmooth green husk, the juice of which stains the fingers black. In an\r\nunripe state, before the shells are formed, the whole fruit may be made\r\ninto a pickle, and also into ketchup. In medicine the unripe fruit is\r\nconsidered of use for the destruction of worms, and is usually administered\r\nin the form of an extract.\r\n\r\nWalnuts become ripe about the beginning of October; and, as they grow in\r\nclusters, generally at the ends of the branches, it is customary to beat\r\nthem down with long poles. The kernel, which is covered with a tough,\r\nyellow, and bitter skin, is more esteemed than that either of the hazel-nut\r\nor filbert. It yields, on pressure, a sweet kind of oil, which, in\r\nquantity, amounts to about half the weight of the kernel.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of walnut, which are well known to the\r\ncultivators of that tree.\r\n\r\n  240. _The HICKORY-NUT_ (Juglans alba) _is a North American species of\r\n  walnut, the shell of which is very hard, does not split asunder like that\r\n  of the walnut, and is of smoother and lighter colour than that_.\r\n\r\nIts kernel is sweet and well tasted, and affords a considerable portion of\r\noil.\r\n\r\n  241. _The HAZEL-NUT and FILBERT are well-known fruits, the former of a\r\n  shrub_ (Corylus avellana, Fig. 67) _which grows in hedges and thickets;\r\n  and the latter of a somewhat similar shrub, which is cultivated in\r\n  orchards and kitchen gardens._\r\n\r\nEach of these kinds of _nuts_ is much esteemed, but particularly the\r\nlatter; the flavour of its kernels being very delicious. They are, however,\r\ndifficult of digestion, and, when eaten in considerable quantity, sometimes\r\nproduce very unpleasant effects. The oil which is obtained from hazel-nuts\r\nby pressure is little inferior in flavour to that of almonds, and, under\r\nthe name of _nut-oil_, is often used by painters. Chemists employ it as the\r\nbasis of fragrant oils artificially prepared, because it easily combines\r\nwith and retains odours. This oil is found serviceable in obstinate coughs.\r\n\r\nIf nuts be put into earthen pots and well closed, and afterwards buried\r\neighteen inches or two feet deep in the earth, they may be kept sound\r\nthrough the winter.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country _hazels_ are planted in coppices and\r\nhedge-rows for several useful purposes; but particularly to be cut down,\r\nperiodically, for charcoal, for poles, fishing-rods, &c. Being extremely\r\ntough and flexible, the branches of the hazel are used for making hurdles,\r\ncrates, withs or bands, and springles to fasten down thatch. They are\r\nformed into spars, handles for implements of husbandry; and, when split,\r\nare bent into hoops for casks. Charcoal made from hazel is much in request\r\nfor forges; and, when prepared in a particular manner, is used by painters\r\nand engravers to draw their outlines.\r\n\r\nIn countries where yeast is scarce, it is not unusual to twist loosely\r\ntogether the slender branches of this shrub, and to steep them in ale-yeast\r\nduring its fermentation. They are then hung up to dry; and, at the next\r\nbrewing, are put into the wort instead of yeast. The _roots_ are used by\r\ncabinet makers for veneering: and, in Italy, the _chips_ of hazel are\r\nsometimes put into turbid wine for the purpose of fining it.\r\n\r\n  242. _The HORNBEAM_ (Carpinus betulus, Fig. 73) _is a forest tree which\r\n  grows to the height of sixty or seventy feet, yet seldom exceeds fifteen\r\n  or eighteen inches in diameter, has smooth white bark, marked with grey\r\n  spots, and leaves about three inches long and two broad, oval, pointed,\r\n  and serrated._\r\n\r\nAs a timber-tree the hornbeam is more esteemed on the Continent than in\r\nthis country. It grows readily in stiff soils, particularly on the sides of\r\nhills; and is easily transplanted. The _wood_, which is white, hard, and\r\ntough, is used by turners; and is wrought into cogs for mill-wheels,\r\nscrew-presses, the heads of beetles, handles of working tools, and other\r\ninstruments and machinery in which great strength is required. As fuel it\r\nis preferred, on account of its readier inflammability, to most other kinds\r\nof wood. The _inner bark_ is used, in some countries, for dyeing yellow.\r\n\r\nFrom the foliage of the hornbeam being luxuriant, and admitting of being\r\nclipped, without injury, into any of those forms which the old French\r\ngarden style required, this tree was formerly much more planted in England\r\nthan it is at present. It preserves a great portion of its withered leaves\r\nthrough the winter; and, if properly planted as a hedge, it forms an\r\nexcellent fence. The German husbandman, when he erects a fence of hornbeam,\r\nthrows up a parapet of earth, with a ditch on each side, and plants his\r\nsets (which he raises from layers) in such a manner that every two plants\r\nmay be brought to intersect each other, in the form of a St. Andrew's\r\ncross. In that part where the plants cross, he scrapes off the bark, and\r\nbends them closely together with straw. In consequence of this operation\r\nthe two plants consolidate into a sort of indissoluble knot, and push, from\r\nthe place of junction, horizontal slanting shoots, which form a living\r\npalisado or _chevaux de frise_; so that such a protection may be called a\r\nrural fortification. These hedges, being annually and carefully pruned,\r\nwill, in a few years, become impenetrable in every part. It is not uncommon\r\nin Germany, to see the high roads thus guarded for many miles together; and\r\ngreat advantage might be derived from adopting the same plan in many parts\r\nof our own kingdom.\r\n\r\n  243. _The PLANE-TREE_ (Platanus orientalis, Fig. 71) _is distinguished by\r\n  having broad leaves, each with about five principal divisions, and these\r\n  subdivided into smaller ones._\r\n\r\nBy the ancient Greeks and Romans the plane-tree was highly valued, on\r\naccount of its grateful shade; and the latter were much delighted by\r\ntraining it in such manner as to admit of their sitting beneath its\r\nbranches. Wherever they built their magnificent colleges for the exercise\r\nof youth, in the gymnastic arts, as riding, wrestling, running, leaping,\r\nthrowing the discus, &c. and where also the gravest philosophers met to\r\nconverse together and improve their studies, they planted avenues and walks\r\nof plane trees for refreshment and shade.\r\n\r\nThough now frequently planted in parks and pleasure grounds, the sycamore\r\n(122) is, in many instances, preferred to it. The plane, though a native of\r\nAsia and the southern parts of Europe, is very hardy, grows rapidly, and\r\nwill flourish in any common soil, and in any aspect.\r\n\r\nIts _wood_, at a certain age, becomes much veined; and, consequently, is\r\nvaluable for many kinds of domestic furniture, but particularly for tables.\r\n\r\n  244. _The CABBAGE-TREE_ (Areca oleracea) _is an American species of palm,\r\n  which grows to the height of a hundred feet and upwards, and is destitute\r\n  of leaves until within a few feet of the summit. The leaves, sometimes\r\n  near twenty feet long, are winged, and the leaflets are entire._\r\n\r\nSuch is the general elegance of this tree that it is frequently denominated\r\nthe queen of woods. Its _fruit_, which grows in bunches from the top, is an\r\noblong and obtuse kind of berry, of bluish purple colour, and about the\r\nsize of an olive. The sheaths of the flowers, and the floral leaves, when\r\nfirst developed, are folded round each other, enclosed in a thin, green,\r\nand spongy bark, eight or nine inches in circumference, and constitute the\r\npart which is denominated the _cabbage_. This is white, and, when boiled,\r\nis esteemed a great luxury. It is also eaten raw as a salad, and fried with\r\nbutter; and its taste is said to resemble that of an artichoke. This part\r\nis likewise frequently made into a pickle with vinegar and spices.\r\n\r\nWe are informed that the cabbage-tree was first introduced into Jamaica by\r\nAdmiral Knowles, when governor of that island; and that it has since been\r\ncultivated there with great attention. But it is chiefly planted for its\r\nbeauty, being considered too valuable to be often cut down for the small\r\nportion of food which it thus affords, however delicious that may be.\r\n\r\nIn the _leaves_ of this tree there is a thread-like substance, which is\r\nsometimes spun, like hemp, and made into different kinds of cordage. The\r\nsockets or grooves formed by the broad part of the footstalks of the leaves\r\nare used by the negroes as cradles for their children; and on the inner\r\nsides of the very young footstalks there are tender pellicles, which, when\r\ndried, may be converted into paper. The _trunks_, when cleared of the pith,\r\nserve as water pipes and gutters. Of the _pith_ a kind of sago is made; and\r\nin this pith, after the trees are felled, there is bred a large species of\r\ncaterpillar which the inhabitants of some of the West Indian islands eat as\r\na great delicacy.\r\n\r\n  245. _The CATECHU, ARECA, or BETEL-NUT-TREE_ (Areca catechu), _is a\r\n  species of palm which grows in the East Indies._\r\n\r\n  _It is generally from thirty to forty feet high, and its trunk is six or\r\n  eight inches in diameter. The leaves, which grow on the summit, are\r\n  winged, having the leaflets folded back; and the fruit is a pulpy berry\r\n  with thin skin, containing a nut about an inch in length, and of a\r\n  rounded conical form._\r\n\r\nThe _kernel_ of the areca-nut, which is covered by a thin, smooth, and\r\nyellowish shell, is somewhat like a nutmeg, but contains, in the centre, a\r\nwhite, soft, greyish, and almost liquid substance, which becomes hard as\r\nthe nut ripens. This fruit is in general use by the Indians, who cut it\r\ninto slices, mix it with other substances, wrap it in the leaves of betel\r\n(22), and chew it much in the same manner as the common people of our\r\ncountry chew tobacco. The consumption of these nuts in India is almost\r\nbeyond calculation. They are an article of considerable trade, from port to\r\nport; and also from India to China, but they are seldom brought into\r\nEngland, though they might be of use in some of our manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe drug called _catechu_, and formerly _terra japonica_, was supposed to\r\nbe an extract prepared from the above nuts; but it is now ascertained to be\r\nmade from the wood of a species of mimosa.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  246. _The SCOTS FIR_ (Pinus sylvestris), _which has its name from growing\r\n  wild in different parts of Scotland, is known from other trees of the\r\n  same tribe by having its slender and somewhat needle-shaped leaves in\r\n  pairs; its cones or seed-vessels somewhat egg-shaped, mostly in pairs, as\r\n  long as the leaves, and the scales blunt._\r\n\r\nThis useful tree flourishes with greatest luxuriance on the north and\r\nnorth-east sides of hills, in a poor and sandy soil, especially where this\r\nis mixed with loam. If planted among rocks, or in bogs, it seldom attains a\r\nlarge size; in black soil it becomes diseased; and in chalky land it\r\nfrequently pines away and dies.\r\n\r\nIts _timber_, under the name of _deal_, is employed as the wood-work of\r\nhouses; for rafters, flooring, doors, the frames of windows, tables, boxes,\r\nand other purposes, infinitely too various to be enumerated. Frigates, and\r\nother ships of large size, have sometimes been constructed of deal but\r\nthese are by no means so durable as vessels that are built of oak. Much of\r\nthe deal which we use is imported from Norway, and other northern parts of\r\nEurope. That from Christiana, which is called _yellow deal_, or _red deal_,\r\nis frequently brought over in planks, but more commonly in boards, each\r\nabout ten inches and half in width. The wood of such trees as are raised in\r\nEngland is equal to the foreign wood in weight and durability, but its\r\ngrain is generally coarser.\r\n\r\nThe _outer bark_ of the fir-tree may be used in the tanning of leather; and\r\nit is said that, in the northern parts of Europe, the soft, white, and\r\nfibrous _inner bark_ is, in times of scarcity, made into a kind of bread.\r\nFor this purpose it is dried over a fire, reduced to powder, kneaded with\r\nwater, and a small portion of corn-flour, into cakes, and baked in an oven.\r\nChildren in Norway are very fond of the fresh bark, in the spring of the\r\nyear, either shaved off with a knife, or grated with a rasp.\r\n\r\n_Common Turpentine_ is the resinous juice chiefly of the Scots fir,\r\nobtained by boring holes into the trunks of the trees, early in spring, and\r\nplacing vessels beneath for its reception. It is of brown colour; and has a\r\nstrong odour, and disagreeable taste. In the distillation of turpentine an\r\nessential oil is produced, called _oil of turpentine_, which is extremely\r\npungent. When the distillation is continued to dryness, the substance which\r\nremains is known by the name of _common resin_ or _rosin_; but, if water be\r\nmixed with it, while yet fluid, and incorporated by violent agitation, a\r\nsubstance is formed called _yellow resin_.\r\n\r\nCommon turpentine is mostly employed as an ingredient in the plasters used\r\nby farriers. The oil is occasionally used in medicine; and, lately, it has\r\nbeen considered efficacious in cases of worms. It is much employed by\r\npainters for rendering their colours more fluid; as well as in the\r\ncomposition of different kinds of varnish used in floor-cloth, umbrella,\r\nand other manufactures. The noxious spirit called gin was formerly\r\nflavoured with juniper berries; but as these are now too expensive, oil of\r\nturpentine, the taste of which in a slight degree resembles that of\r\njuniper, is applied to the same purpose; and considerable quantities of\r\nturpentine are thus consumed. The common resin is used in plasters, for\r\nwhich its great adhesiveness renders it peculiarly applicable. It is also\r\nof considerable importance in the arts; and musicians rub the bows and\r\nstrings of violins with it, to take off the greasy particles which are\r\nthere collected, as well as to counteract the effects of moisture. Yellow\r\nresin is used in plasters, and for other purposes in medicine.\r\n\r\n_Tar_ is obtained from the roots and refuse parts of the fir-tree, by\r\ncutting them into billets, piling these, in a proper manner, in pits or\r\novens formed for the purpose, covering them partly over, and setting them\r\non fire. During the burning, a black and thick matter, which is the tar,\r\nfalls to the bottom, and is conducted thence into vessels which are placed\r\nto receive it, and from which it is afterwards poured into barrels for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nTar is an article of great utility in manufactures, and for various\r\neconomical purposes. It is much employed for smearing the rigging, and\r\nother external parts of ships, to prevent their receiving injury from\r\nmoisture. It has been used in medicine both internally and externally; and\r\nparticularly _tar-water_, or water impregnated with tar, was, some years\r\nago, a popular remedy in various disorders, but its virtues have been too\r\nmuch extolled. Although considerable quantities of tar are prepared in this\r\ncountry, these are insufficient to supply the demand; consequently we,\r\nevery year, import great quantities of it from Russia, Sweden, America, and\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n_Pitch_ is usually made by melting together coarse hard resin and an equal\r\nquantity of tar; or, as some writers state, by boiling tar with a certain\r\nportion of water, until it becomes so thick that, on cooling, it forms a\r\nhard black mass.\r\n\r\nBy the ancients pitch was much employed for giving flavour and fragrance to\r\ntheir wines. With us it is of extensive use to mechanics, and in numerous\r\nmanufactures; but the principal demand for it is in ship-building, to\r\nsecure the joints and crevices of the planks and timbers, and for other\r\npurposes. When mixed with a certain quantity of oil and suet, it is made\r\ninto _shoe-makers' wax_; and, in conjunction with whale fat, forms\r\n_carriage-grease_, or the substance with which the wheels of carriages are\r\nsmeared. The best pitch is imported from Sweden and Norway: and, is of a\r\nglossy black colour, perfectly dry, and very brittle.\r\n\r\n_Lamp-black_ is a soot formed by burning the dregs and coarser parts of tar\r\nin furnaces constructed for that purpose. The smoke is conveyed through\r\ntubes into boxes, each covered with linen, in the form of a cone. Upon this\r\nlinen the soot is deposited: and it is, from time to time, beaten off into\r\nthe boxes, and afterwards packed in barrels for sale. This substance is\r\nemployed in printing and dyeing; and has its name from the practice that\r\nwas formerly adopted of making it by means of lamps.\r\n\r\n  247. _The WEYMOUTH PINE is chiefly distinguished by its leaves growing in\r\n  fives, and its cones being smooth, cylindrical, and longer than the\r\n  leaves._\r\n\r\nThis species of fir-tree grows wild in North America, and succeeds well in\r\nstrong land in England. Its _timber_ is white, of more open grain than\r\nScots fir, and not so heavy as that. In America it is principally used for\r\nthe masts of ships, for which, by its toughness, it is peculiarly\r\ncalculated.\r\n\r\n  248. _The SPRUCE FIR_ (Pinus abies), _a native of Norway, and other\r\n  Northern parts of Europe, is known by its short, and four-sided leaves\r\n  growing singly, and surrounding the branches; its cones being\r\n  cylindrical, the scales somewhat square, flattened, and notched at the\r\n  top_\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the spruce fir is what the English carpenters usually\r\ndenominate _white deal_. It is considered next in value to that obtained\r\nfrom the Scots fir; and is remarkable for having few knots. On account of\r\nits lightness it is peculiarly adapted for packing-cases and musical\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nFrom incisions made into the trunk of the spruce fir-tree, a fine and clear\r\n_turpentine_ oozes, which, after being boiled in water, and strained\r\nthrough a linen cloth, acquires a somewhat solid consistence, and reddish\r\nbrown colour; and is called _Burgundy pitch_. This is employed as an\r\ningredient in several kinds of ointments and plasters: and is principally\r\nmanufactured in Saxony.\r\n\r\nThe article called _essence of spruce_, which is used in making spruce\r\nbeer, is prepared from the branches of this tree, and from those of a\r\nspecies nearly allied to it which grows in America.\r\n\r\n  249. _The LARCH_ (Pinus laryx), _a native of the Alps, and the mountains\r\n  of Germany, is a species of fir, which has its leaves in tufts, and its\r\n  cones oblong, and of somewhat oval shape, the margins of the scales bent\r\n  back, and jagged._\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of larch-trees has of late been much recommended for\r\nadoption in this country, on account of the value of their _timber_, which\r\nfor strength and durability, is equal to most kinds of deal. It is well\r\ncalculated for masts, and the framework of vessels, being capable of\r\nsustaining much greater pressure even than oak. For wood-work constantly\r\nimmersed in water, it is peculiarly calculated, as, in such situations, it\r\nis asserted to become almost as hard as stone. In Petersburg larch timber\r\nis applied to no other use than that of ship-building. Line-of-battle ships\r\nare constructed of it in Archangel, and these generally last about fifteen\r\nyears; though, in milder climates, it is imagined that they would last much\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nFor gates, pales, and similar work, exposed to the vicissitudes of weather,\r\nthey are admirably serviceable; and for flooring and other internal\r\npurposes are at least equally durable. Buildings constructed of larch\r\ntimber are said to have continued sound for 200 years; and, in some of the\r\nold palaces in Venice, there are beams of larch yet existing that are as\r\nsound as when they were first placed. But the very combustible nature of\r\nthis wood renders it objectionable for such uses. No wood with which we are\r\nacquainted affords more durable staves for casks than larch; and, in the\r\nopinion of many persons, it is further valuable by improving the flavour of\r\nthe wine contained in them. The wood is of delicate colour, not unlike the\r\ncedar used for black-lead pencils, but is knotty almost throughout.\r\n\r\nFrom the _inner bark_ of the larch the Russians manufacture a soft and fine\r\nkind of white gloves. The trunk, if tapped betwixt the months of March and\r\nSeptember, yields an extremely pure turpentine, which has the name of\r\n_Venice turpentine_; and is of considerable use in medicine. It is usually\r\nthinner than any other kind of turpentine, and of clear, whitish, or\r\nyellowish colour. The drug of this name, which is generally met with in the\r\nshops, is now imported from New England, but was formerly brought from\r\nVenice. A brown gummy substance, known in Russia by the name of _Orenburgh\r\ngum_, is obtained by a curious process from the sap of the tree. On the\r\nlarge branches of the larch are produced small, sweetish grains, somewhat\r\nresembling sugar; which are frequently substituted for the drug called\r\nmanna (275).\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the larch was first introduced into Britain towards the\r\nconclusion of the seventeenth century. The trees will grow in almost any\r\nsoil; and the proper season for felling them is the month of July. They,\r\nhowever, seldom attain any large size in this country; and they are said to\r\ndecay and become covered with moss, when about forty years old.\r\n\r\n  250. _The CYPRESS-TREE_ (Cupressus sempervirens) _is a dark-coloured\r\n  evergreen, a native of the Levant, the leaves of which are extremely\r\n  small, and entirely cover all the slender branches, lying close upon them\r\n  so as to give them a somewhat quadrangular shape._\r\n\r\n  _In some of the trees the branches diminish gradually in length from the\r\n  bottom to the top, in such manner as to form a nearly pyramidal shape._\r\n\r\nIn many of the old gardens in this country cypress-trees are still to be\r\nfound, but their generally sombre and gloomy appearance has caused them, of\r\nlate years, to be much neglected. They are, however, very valuable on\r\naccount of their _wood_, which is hard, compact, and durable, of pale or\r\nreddish colour, with deep veins, and pleasant smell. We are informed by\r\nPliny that the doors of the famous temple of Diana, at Ephesus, were of\r\ncypress wood, and that, although they were 400 years old at the time when\r\nhe wrote, they appeared to be nearly as fresh as new. Indeed this wood was\r\nso much esteemed by the ancients, that the image of Jupiter in the capitol\r\nwas made of it. The gates of St. Peter's church at Rome are stated to have\r\nbeen of cypress, and to have lasted more than 1000 years, from the time of\r\nthe Emperor Constantine until that of Pope Eugenius the Fourth, when gates\r\nof brass were erected in their stead. As this wood, in addition to its\r\nother qualities, takes a fine polish, and is not liable to suffer from the\r\nattacks of insects, it was formerly much esteemed for cabinet furniture. By\r\nthe Greeks, in the time of Thucydides, it was used for the coffins of\r\neminent warriors; and many of the chests which enclose Egyptian mummies are\r\nmade of it. The latter afford very decisive proof of its almost\r\nincorruptible nature.\r\n\r\nThe name of this tree is derived from the island of Cyprus, in the\r\nMediterranean, where it still grows in great luxuriance. Its gloomy hue\r\ncaused it to be consecrated by the ancients to Pluto, and to be used at the\r\nfunerals of people of eminence. Pliny states that, in his time, it was\r\ncustomary to place branches of the cypress-tree before the houses in which\r\npersons lay dead.\r\n\r\n  251. _The CASSAVA, or CASSADA_ (Jatropha manihot) _is a South American\r\n  shrub, about three feet in height, with broad, shining, and somewhat\r\n  hand-shaped leaves, and beautiful white and rose-coloured flowers._\r\n\r\nIt is a very remarkable circumstance, that the _roots_ of the cassava, if\r\neaten raw, are a fatal poison both to man and beast, and that, when\r\nprepared by heat, they yield a safe and valuable food; on which, indeed,\r\nmany both of the Indian and European inhabitants of South America almost\r\nwholly subsist. The roots are the only edible parts of the plant. These,\r\nwhich are white, soft, and farinaceous, from one to two feet in length, and\r\nfive or six inches in circumference, are dug out of the earth, at a certain\r\nseason of the year, washed, stripped of their rind, and ground to a pulp.\r\nThe juice, or poisonous part, is pressed out, and carefully thrown away; as\r\ncattle, and other animals, which have accidentally drunk of it, have almost\r\ninstantly died. The flour that remains, after pressure, is formed into thin\r\nround cakes and baked. To an European, accustomed to other bread, these,\r\nthough sweetish, and not unpalatable, have an insipid taste. If placed in\r\nclose vessels, and preserved from the attacks of insects, cassava bread may\r\nbe kept for several months without injury.\r\n\r\nWith the natives of South America, it is not unusual to throw a great\r\nnumber of cakes of cassava together to heat, after which they soak them in\r\nwater, which causes a rapid fermentation to take place; and from the liquor\r\nthus obtained, they make a very sharp and disagreeable, but intoxicating\r\nbeverage, which will not keep longer than twenty-four hours without\r\nspoiling.\r\n\r\nFrom the pure flour of cassava is formed the substance called _tapioca_,\r\nwhich is frequently imported into this country, and is used for jelly,\r\npuddings, and other culinary purposes. It is prepared from the fibrous part\r\nof the roots by taking a small quantity of the pulp, after the juice is\r\nextracted, and working it in the hand till a thick white cream appears on\r\nthe surface. This, being separated, and washed in water, gradually subsides\r\nto the bottom. After the water is poured off, the remaining moisture is\r\ndissipated by a slow fire, the substance being constantly stirred, until at\r\nlength it is formed into grains about the size of sago (266). These become\r\nhard by keeping, and are the purest and most wholesome part of the cassava.\r\n\r\nThe roots of another species of this shrub, called _sweet cassava_, are\r\nusually eaten with butter, and merely after being roasted in hot ashes.\r\nThey have much the flavour of chesnuts, and are an agreeable and nutritive\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n  252. _The TALLOW TREE_ (Croton sebiferum) _is a native of China, and in\r\n  habit somewhat resembles a cherry-tree, but has shining egg-shaped, and\r\n  pointed leaves, that form tufts at the extremity of the branches._\r\n\r\nThe _fruit_ of this tree, from which the Chinese obtain a kind of tallow\r\nfor the manufacture of candles, is enclosed in a husk, not much unlike that\r\nof the chesnut, and consists of three round white kernels. All the\r\npreparation that is requisite is to melt these kernels, adding a little\r\noil, to render them softer and more pliant than they would otherwise be.\r\nThe candles made from this substance are very white, but are sometimes\r\ncoloured by adding a little vermilion. They are more firm than those of\r\ntallow, but not equal in quality to candles either of wax or spermaceti.\r\nThe wicks that are used are not, like ours, made of cotton, but consist of\r\nlittle rods of light, dry wood, with the pith of a rush entwined round\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  253. _INDIAN RUBBER, or CAOUTCHOUC, is the dried juice of a large and\r\n  much branched tree_ (Siphonia elastica, Fig. 60), _which grows in Guiana,\r\n  and other parts of South America._\r\n\r\n  _This tree has somewhat oval leaves, entire, veined, and smooth, arranged\r\n  in threes, and on long foot-stalks._\r\n\r\n  _The flowers are small, in bunches, near the ends of the branches, and\r\n  the fruit is triangular._\r\n\r\nIt was not until about the year 1736, that this very extraordinary natural\r\nproduction was made known in Europe. It is obtained by making incisions\r\nthrough the bark of the tree, chiefly in wet weather. From the wounds thus\r\nformed the juice flows abundantly. It is of milky-white colour, and is\r\nconducted by a tube or leaf, supported by clay, into a vessel placed to\r\nreceive it. Some writers assert that, on mere exposure to the air, it\r\ngradually hardens; and others that, for this purpose, it goes through a\r\ncertain process, which the Indians keep a profound secret. It is usually\r\nbrought to Europe in the shape of pear-shaped bottles, which are formed by\r\nspreading the juice over a mould of clay. These are exposed to a dense\r\nsmoke, or to a fire, till they become so dry as not to stick to the\r\nfingers; and then, by certain instruments of iron or wood, they are\r\nornamented on the outside with various figures. This done, the clay in the\r\ninside is moistened with water and picked out.\r\n\r\nIndian rubber is remarkable for the flexibility and elasticity which it\r\nacquires on attaining a solid state; and also for the numerous useful\r\npurposes to which it is capable of being applied. By the Indians it is\r\nsometimes formed into boots, which are impenetrable by water, and which,\r\nwhen smoked, have the appearance of leather. Bottles are made of it, to\r\nwhose necks are fastened hollow reeds, through which the liquor contained\r\nin them can be squirted at pleasure. One of these, filled with water, is\r\nalways presented to each of the guests at their entertainments. Flambeaux\r\nare likewise formed of this substance, which give a very brilliant light;\r\nand it is said that a torch of Indian rubber, an inch and a half in\r\ndiameter, and two feet long, will burn twelve hours. The inhabitants of\r\nQuito prepare a species of oil-cloth with the hardened juice of this tree.\r\n\r\nThe principal uses to which Indian rubber is applied by us are, for the\r\neffacing of black-lead marks; for flexible syringes, tubes, and other\r\ninstruments used by surgeons and chemists; and for the formation, by means\r\nof turpentine or linseed oil, of a varnish for air-balloons.\r\n\r\nVarious experiments have been made to dissolve this substance, so that it\r\nmay assume its naturally elastic state, under any figure that may be\r\nrequired. This has been effected by means of ether, but the process is too\r\nexpensive for common use. A simple method of forming tubes of it is to\r\nsplit a piece of cane and to put between the pieces a slip of whalebone. If\r\nthe Indian rubber be cut into slips, and twisted closely round the cane,\r\nand the heat of boiling water be applied, the whole will become united into\r\none piece or tube, from which the whalebone first, and afterwards the cane,\r\nmay easily be separated.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that cloth of all kinds may be made impenetrable by\r\nwater, if impregnated with the fresh juice of the Indian rubber tree; and\r\nthat boots, gloves, and other articles, made of cloth thus prepared, may be\r\njoined without sewing, and only by moistening the edges with the juice.\r\nThese are not only more durable, but retain their shape better than such as\r\nare made of the juice without any connecting substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has lately been ascertained that, in Prince of Wales's Island, and also\r\nin Sumatra, there are trees of a class and order totally different from\r\nthat above described, which yield a juice similar to this, and applicable\r\nto all the same purposes.\r\n\r\n  254. _The CASTOR-OIL PLANT_ (Ricinus palma christi) _is a native both of\r\n  the East and West Indies, and has a stem from five to fifteen or sixteen\r\n  feet in height, and large bluish-green leaves, divided into seven lobes,\r\n  serrated and pointed, the footstalks long, and inserted into the disk._\r\n\r\n  _The flowers are produced in a terminating spike, and the seed-vessels\r\n  are covered with spines, and contain each three flattish oblong seeds._\r\n\r\nIt is to the seeds of this plant that we are indebted for the drug called\r\n_castor-oil_. This is sometimes obtained by pressing the seeds, in the same\r\nway as is practised with respect to oil of almonds (152). But the mode\r\nchiefly adopted in the West Indies, whence we principally import it, is\r\nfirst to strip the seeds of their husks or pods, and then to bruise them in\r\na mortar; afterwards they are tied in linen bags, and boiled in water until\r\nthe oil which they contain rises to the surface; this is carefully skimmed\r\noff, strained to free it from any accidental impurities, and bottled for\r\nuse. The oil which is obtained by boiling is considered more mild than that\r\nobtained by pressure, but it sooner becomes rancid. The mildest and finest\r\nof the Jamaica castor-oil is limpid, nearly colourless, and has scarcely\r\nmore taste or smell than good olive-oil.\r\n\r\nThe uses of castor-oil in medicine are well known.\r\n\r\nThe plant is sufficiently hardy to grow and ripen its seeds in the open\r\nground of gardens, in the south of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XXII.--DIOECIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDIANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n255.  _WILLOW, OSIER, or WITHY._--Of this very extensive tribe nearly fifty\r\ndistinct species have been discovered in our own island. The slender\r\nbranches of many of these are applied to useful purposes, but particularly\r\nfor making baskets, bird-cages, and what is called wicker-work; springles\r\nfor fastening down thatch, wheels or traps for catching lobsters and eels;\r\nhoops and crates. The _wood_ is useful for the handles of hatchets, prongs,\r\nspades, and other rural implements; and also furnishes shoemakers with\r\ncutting and whetting boards, on which they cut leather and sharpen the\r\nedges of their knives.\r\n\r\nAs willows generally flourish in wet situations, some of the species are\r\nplanted with a view to prevent the banks of rivers and brooks from being\r\nwashed away by floods.\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ of some kinds of willow has been applied, with effect, as a\r\nsubstitute for Peruvian bark, in the cure of intermittent fevers. It has\r\nalso been esteemed useful in the tanning of leather; and, in combination\r\nwith alder, for striking a deep black colour, in the dyeing of linen.\r\n\r\nThe bark of other species may be manufactured into paper. In the year 1788,\r\nMr. Greaves of Milbank, near Warrington, Lancashire, made fifteen reams of\r\ncoarse paper from the bark of withen twigs, intermixed with a few nettles.\r\nThe latter, however, he afterwards discovered, would better have been left\r\nout, as there was in them a woody substance, which does not well\r\nincorporate with other vegetables. The paper he made was considerably\r\ncheaper than paper of equal size and thickness made from ropes; and it was\r\nfound that pasteboard, for book covers, made of withen bark, would be much\r\ncheaper than similar pasteboard manufactured from ropes. The process by\r\nwhich this paper and pasteboard were manufactured was as follows; the bark\r\nwas stripped from the twigs in September, the time at which they are\r\nusually cut for making white baskets; it was then hackled, like flax or\r\nhemp, and dried in the sun, which gave it somewhat the appearance of brown\r\nhemp: but this having been attended with considerable trouble, other parts\r\nof the bark were dried with the leaves, as they were stripped off from the\r\ntwigs, and were then submitted to the operation of the paper-mill.\r\n\r\nThe flowering branches of one species, the _common sallow_ (_Salix\r\ncineria_), are called palms, and are gathered by children, in many parts of\r\nEngland, on Palm Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  256. _NUTMEGS are the kernels of a fruit produced in several islands of\r\n  the East Indies._\r\n\r\n  _They are each surrounded by the spice called_ mace, _and, externally, by\r\n  a husk about half an inch in thickness, which has somewhat the appearance\r\n  of a small peach_ (Fig. 80).\r\n\r\n  _The nutmeg-tree_ (Myristica aromatica) _is not unlike our cherry-tree,\r\n  both in growth and size. Its leaves are nearly oval, but pointed, waved,\r\n  obliquely nerved, of bright green colour above, and whitish beneath. The\r\n  flowers are small, and hang upon slender stalks._\r\n\r\nWhen this fruit is nearly ripe the husk opens at the end, and exposes a\r\nnet-work of scarlet mace. Underneath the mace is a black shell, about as\r\nthick as that of a filbert, and very hard; and in this is contained the\r\nnutmeg.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of _nutmegs_ is performed by persons who ascend the trees for\r\nthat purpose, and pull the branches to them with long hooks. The husks are\r\nstripped off in the woods, and the remaining part of the fruit, with its\r\nsurrounding mace, is taken home. After the mace has been carefully stripped\r\noff, with a small knife, the nuts, which are still covered with their woody\r\nshell, are dried, first in the sun, and then upon a frame of split bamboos\r\nplaced over a slow fire, until, when shaken, the kernels are heard to\r\nrattle within the shells. These now easily fly to pieces when beaten with\r\nsmall sticks; and the nutmegs, being taken out, are soaked in sea-water and\r\nlime, and are then thrown in great numbers together to heat, by which their\r\nvegetating principle is destroyed. The nutmegs are finally sorted into\r\nparcels, according to their quality, and packed in bags for sale and\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\nThe nutmegs vended at the East India Company's sales in 1804, amounted in\r\nweight to 117,936 pounds, and produced 54,733_l._ exclusive of the duties.\r\nThis kind of spice has long been employed both for culinary and medicinal\r\npurposes. Distilled with water, nutmegs afford a large portion of essential\r\noil, which resembles, in flavour, the spice itself. When heated and pressed\r\nthey yield a considerable quantity of limpid yellow oil. In the shops a\r\nthick and fragrant kind is sold, which, though called _oil of mace_, is, in\r\nreality, expressed from the nutmeg. The best oil of this description is\r\nimported from the East Indies, in stone jars. _Oil of nutmegs_ is chiefly\r\nmade from the imperfect fruit, and such as would be unfit for the European\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n_Mace_, or the covering of the nutmeg, that lies betwixt the outer coat and\r\nthe shell, is an unctuous membrane, first of a light red, and afterwards,\r\nwhen dried, and as we see it, of yellowish colour. After it is taken from\r\nthe shell it is exposed to the sun, then moistened with sea-water, and\r\nfinally so far dried as to allow of its being packed in bales for\r\nexportation. In these it is pressed closely down, by which its fragrance\r\nand peculiar qualities are preserved. Mace is liable to seizure if imported\r\nin packages of less than 300 pounds' weight. We usually see it in flakes\r\neach about an inch in length, and presenting a great variety of\r\nramifications. This spice has a very fragrant and agreeable odour, and, to\r\nmost persons, a pleasant, though somewhat acrid, taste. It possesses nearly\r\nall the virtues of the nutmeg, but with less astringency; and, like that,\r\nis employed in numerous ways, both in culinary preparations and medicine.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Banda it is sometimes customary to boil the _entire fruit_\r\nof the nutmeg-tree, and afterwards to preserve it in syrup, and also to\r\npickle it in spiced vinegar, in nearly the same manner as we pickle\r\nwalnuts. In several parts of the East the inhabitants preserve the _outer\r\nhusk_ of the nutmeg as a sweetmeat, or eat it stewed with other food.\r\n\r\n  257. _The DATE is a fruit shaped somewhat like a large acorn, and covered\r\n  externally with a yellowish membrane or skin, which contains a fine,\r\n  soft, and sweetish pulp, and, in the centre, an oblong, hard stone._\r\n\r\n  _The trees_ (Phoenix dactylifera) _which produce this fruit, grow chiefly\r\n  on the shores of the Mediterranean, are forty feet and upwards in height,\r\n  have an upright stem, marked through their whole length with\r\n  protuberances, and terminated at the summit with a cluster of winged\r\n  leaves or branches, each eight or nine feet in length._\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the date is attentively pursued on the African coast of\r\nthe Mediterranean; in several parts of Persia, Arabia, and even in Spain.\r\nThe latter country, however, is not sufficiently warm to ripen the fruit in\r\nperfection, without the constant labour of the cultivator. He is obliged to\r\nascend the trees, from time to time, to examine the flowers and turn them\r\ntowards the sun. This is chiefly done in the spring of the year; and,\r\nduring the month of August, another and much more dangerous operation is\r\nrequisite, namely, to tie all the branches into one bundle, and cover them\r\nover with broom. To make this bundle, the person employed is obliged to\r\nleap, as it were, over the flexible branches, for the purpose of\r\nsurrounding and uniting them with a cord. This operation over, he places a\r\nladder at the bottom of the tree, on which he stands to make a second band;\r\nhe then places his ladder on this second band, ascends and ties the top\r\nwith a third cord. His bundle being formed, he throws down his instruments,\r\nreplaces his ladder by a gradation contrary to the former, and descends,\r\nfrom band to band, to the stem of the tree, down which he slides to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nAmong the Africans and Egyptians the date constitutes a principal article\r\nof food, and, as such, it is considered both wholesome and nutritive. Its\r\nname is a word, formed of _dacte_ or _dactylus_, implying a finger, from an\r\nimaginary resemblance which this fruit has to the end of the finger.\r\nAlthough dates, in general, are of yellowish colour, some are black, some\r\nwhite, and others brown: some also are sweet, and others bitter. The best\r\nare called _royal dates_, and are imported into this country from Tunis.\r\n\r\nEach tree produces ten or twelve bunches of fruit, which, when gathered,\r\nare hung up in a dry place, until so much of their moisture is evaporated\r\nas to allow of their being packed in boxes for exportation.\r\n\r\nNearly all the parts of the date-tree are useful. The _wood_, though of\r\nspongy texture, is employed for the beams and rafters of houses, and for\r\nimplements of husbandry, which are said to be very durable. The _pith_ of\r\nthe young trees is eaten, as well as the young and tender _leaves_. From\r\nthe old leaves and their stalks the women and children of Valencia make\r\nmats, baskets, and other utensils; and from other filamentous parts, ropes\r\nand different kinds of cordage are manufactured. A considerable traffic is\r\ncarried on in these leaves, which, under the name of _palms_, are sent to\r\nItaly, to be used in the grand religious ceremonies of Palm Sunday. In\r\nPersia an ardent spirit is distilled from the fruit; and, in many places,\r\nthe _stones_ are ground to make oil, and the paste that is left is given as\r\nfood to cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENTANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  258. _MASTIC is a resinous substance, obtained from a low tree or shrub_\r\n  (Pistacia lentiscus) _which grows in the Levant._\r\n\r\n  _It has alternate winged leaves, consisting of several pairs of\r\n  spear-shaped leaflets, and spikes of very small flowers, which issue from\r\n  the junction of the leaves with the branches._\r\n\r\nThe mode in which this resin is obtained is by making incisions across the\r\ntree in different parts. From these the juice exudes in drops, that are\r\nsuffered to run upon the ground, and there to remain until they are\r\nsufficiently hard to be collected for use. The season for this process\r\ncommences in the dry weather at the beginning of August, and lasts until\r\nthe end of September. The best mastic is that imported from the island of\r\nScio. We receive it in semi-transparent grains of yellowish colour. These\r\nemit an agreeable smell when heated; and, when chewed, they first crumble,\r\nand afterwards stick together, and become soft and white like wax.\r\n\r\nWith the Turkish women it is customary to chew this resin for the purpose\r\nof rendering their breath agreeable, and under a notion also that it tends\r\nto make their teeth white, and to strengthen the gums. They also mix it in\r\nfragrant waters, and burn it with other odoriferous substances, by way of\r\nperfume. It was formerly much used in medicine, as a remedy against pain in\r\nthe teeth and gums; and, dissolved in spirit of wine, as a relief in\r\nobstinate and long continued coughs: but it is now almost wholly disused\r\nfor these purposes; and is chiefly employed in the composition of varnish,\r\nand by dentists, for filling up the cavities of decayed teeth.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the mastic-tree is imported in thick knotty pieces, covered\r\nexternally with an ash-coloured bark. This wood is accounted a mild,\r\nbalsamic astringent; and a preparation of it, under the name of _aurum\r\npotabile_, is strongly recommended, by some of the German writers, in\r\ncoughs, nausea, and weakness of the stomach.\r\n\r\n  259. _HEMP is the fibrous part of the stalks of a plant_ (Cannabis\r\n  sativa, Fig. 82) _which grows wild in the East Indies, and is much\r\n  cultivated in different parts of Europe._\r\n\r\n  _It has the lower leaves in slender finger-like divisions; the male\r\n  flowers in small loose spikes, at the end of the stem and branches; and\r\n  the female flowers single, at the junction of the leaves and stem._\r\n\r\nThe principal country for hemp, as an article of commerce, is Russia, few\r\nother countries of Europe growing a quantity sufficient for their own\r\nconsumption. It is cultivated in some parts of Britain, but particularly in\r\nthe counties of Suffolk and Norfolk. The soil best adapted to it is a moist\r\nbut loose sandy loam, or the black mould of low lands near water. The seed\r\nis sown in April or May; and the plants, which attain the height of five or\r\nsix feet, are in a state to be pulled up in three or four months; the male\r\nplant, or _fimble hemp_, as it is called, being ready some time before the\r\nfemale plants, which have the name of _karle_ or _seed-hemp_.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hemp is pulled, it is tied in bundles and set up to dry;\r\nand, at the end of about ten days, the bundles are loosened at the top, and\r\nthe heads are held upon a hurdle by one person, whilst another, with a\r\nsmall threshing-flail, beats out the seed.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of hemp for the manufacturer two modes are pursued. One\r\nof these is to spread it out on stubble or pasture ground, that the fibrous\r\nparts may be rendered separable by the gradual operation of the weather;\r\nthe other is to immerse the bundles, for some days, in stagnant water. The\r\nnext process consists in separating the bark, or hemp, from the stalks:\r\nthis is effected either by pulling out the stalk with the hand, or by\r\nmachinery similar to that adopted in the preparation of flax (97). After\r\nsome other operations the hemp is beaten in mills, and then combed or\r\ndressed by drawing it through instruments called _hackles_, which are\r\nsomewhat similar to the combs of wool-manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThus prepared, the hemp is spun into thread, which is made into twine,\r\nropes, and cordage of every description; and woven into canvas, and strong\r\ncloth of various kinds. Indeed so great is the importance of this\r\nproduction, particularly for the cordage, cables, and the rigging of ships,\r\nthat, to encourage its growth, an act of parliament was passed in 1783,\r\ndirecting a bounty of three pence per stone to be paid on all hemp raised\r\nin Great Britain; and imposing heavy duties on hemp imported from foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nFrom _hemp-seed_ a valuable kind of _oil_ is procured, by pressure, which\r\nis peculiarly adapted for burning, as it is perfectly limpid and without\r\nsmell: it is also used for making the soap called green soap. The seeds\r\nthemselves are sometimes employed in the feeding of poultry, from a notion\r\nthat they cause the hens to lay a greater number of eggs than they\r\notherwise would do. They are also given as food to singing birds; but, if\r\nin great quantity, they are supposed to injure the plumage. The _stalks_,\r\nafter the hemp is taken from them, afford an excellent fuel. The water in\r\nwhich hemp has been soaked is in a high degree poisonous.\r\n\r\n  260. _HOPS are the dried flower-buds of a climbing British plant_\r\n  (Humulus lupulus, Fig. 81), _with a rough and angular stem, and leaves\r\n  generally in three or five lobes or divisions, and serrated._\r\n\r\nAlthough hops grow wild, in great abundance, on hedges in several parts of\r\nthe south of England, there is reason to suppose that their use was first\r\nmade known from the Continent in the reign of Henry the Eighth.\r\n\r\nA hop plantation requires the growth of some years before it is in\r\nperfection. The plants begin to push up their young stems about the month\r\nof April. When these are three or four inches above the ground, poles about\r\ntwenty feet high are driven in to support them during their growth. The\r\nseason for picking hops usually commences about the middle of September.\r\nThis work is performed by men, women, and children. Proper baskets, bins,\r\nor cribs being in readiness, the plants are cut off close to the ground,\r\nand the poles are drawn up. These are placed upon the bins, with the plants\r\nupon them, and three or more persons on each side, pick off the hops. After\r\nthis they are dried in a kiln, and, when dry, are carried into, and kept,\r\nfor five or six days, in an apartment called the stowage-room, until they\r\nare in a state to be put into bags. This is done through a round hole, or\r\ntrap, cut in the floor of the stowage-room, exactly equal in dimensions to\r\nthe mouth of the bag, and immediately under which this mouth is fastened.\r\nIn each of the lower corners of the bag a small handful of hops is tied;\r\nand a person, called the packer, places himself in it, and, by a heavy\r\nleaden weight, which he constantly moves round in the places where he is\r\nnot treading, presses and forces the hops down, in a very close manner,\r\ninto the bag, as fast as they are thrown to him by another labourer. The\r\nwork thus proceeds till the bag is quite full, when each of the upper\r\ncorners has a few hops tied in it, in the same manner as those at the\r\nbottom. These serve as handles for moving the bags. The bag is then taken\r\naway, and its mouth is properly sewed up and secured.\r\n\r\nThe hops of finest colour and best sample are put into bags of finer\r\nmanufacture than the others, under the denomination of _pockets_; and the\r\ninferior sorts are packed in canvas of coarser kind, called _bags_.\r\n\r\nWhen the hop-picking is completed, the poles are cleared from the binds or\r\nplants which adhered to them, and are stacked or piled together. The\r\n_binds_, when perfectly dried, are either stacked or placed in sheds, to be\r\nused as fuel in ovens, or otherwise. Sometimes they are burnt upon the\r\nland, for the ashes to serve as manure, trodden in the farm-yard, or\r\nallowed to be taken away by the labourers for their own use.\r\n\r\nAs the hop-plants are liable to be injured in various ways during their\r\ngrowth, they are considered a very precarious crop. They suffer from the\r\nattacks of insects, from honey-dew, from blight, from hot sunny weather\r\nafter rain, and by winds and storms.\r\n\r\nThe principal _use of hops_, in brewing, is for the preservation of malt\r\nliquor, and to communicate to it an agreeably aromatic bitter flavour. The\r\nbest hops are used for ale and the finer kinds of malt liquor, and inferior\r\nkinds are used for porter. The odour of hops hung over a bed, or a pillow\r\nstuffed with hops, has been said to promote sleep, after the application of\r\nopium has failed. The _young shoots_ and tops are often gathered from the\r\nhedges, by poor people, and boiled and eaten in the manner of asparagus. Of\r\nthe woody part of the _hop-binds_, after having been steeped in water, and\r\nworked into a pulp, a coarse kind of paper may be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  261. _YAMS are an American and West Indian root of very irregular shape,\r\n  which possess properties somewhat similar to those of the potatoe, but\r\n  they are less mealy, and, in a raw state, are very viscous._\r\n\r\n  _The plants_ (Dioscorea bulbifera) _which produce these roots have\r\n  heart-shaped leaves, and a stem that creeps along the ground like ivy._\r\n\r\nIn some of the rich lands of South America, yams are said to grow to the\r\nweight of fifty or sixty pounds each; and are so productive that an acre of\r\nground planted with them has been known to produce roots to the weight of\r\nfrom 20,000 to 30,000 pounds. Yams are propagated by setting the eyes, in\r\nthe same manner as we plant potatoes; and, in six or eight months, they\r\narrive at maturity.\r\n\r\nWhen they are dug out of the ground, they are, for a little while, exposed\r\nto the sun to dry; and if, after this, they be packed in casks full of dry\r\nsand, they may be preserved, without injury, for many months. They are\r\nconsequently often used as sea-store for vessels about to sail on long\r\nvoyages, and are frequently brought into England. Several attempts have\r\nbeen made to cultivate yams in this island; and these have been attended\r\nwith a certain degree of success in the counties of Mid-Lothian, Perth, and\r\nStirling in Scotland, where they are used for the feeding of cattle. There\r\nare two kinds, one red, and the other white. The former of these contain a\r\nmore nutritive food than the latter, though their flavour is much less\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nWith the negroes, in the West Indian islands, the yam is a very important\r\narticle of food. When roasted, it is so wholesome and nutritive that it is\r\npreferred by them even to bread. Like potatoes, yams may be converted into\r\nbread, by mixture with a portion of wheat or barley flour. They are\r\nsometimes made into soup, puddings, and other useful dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n262. _The ABELE, or GREAT WHITE POPLAR-TREE_ (Populus alba, Fig. 74), _is a\r\nBritish tree which grows in hedges and woods, near brooks, and is known by\r\nits leaves being nearly triangular, irregularly jagged at the edges, and\r\ncottony underneath._\r\n\r\nThe quickness of growth of this tree is so great that it will sometimes\r\nmake shoots from eighteen to twenty feet in length in one year; and the\r\ntrees attain their full growth in the course of twenty years. The _wood_ is\r\nwhite and soft, but tough and of close grain, and not subject to warp or\r\nshrink. Hence it has been found useful for the flooring of rooms, and for\r\nmaking laths and packing boxes. For turnery ware it is preferred to most\r\nother kinds of wood, on account of its peculiar whiteness, and the ease\r\nwith which it is worked in the lathe. \"Of this wood,\" says Evelyn, \"people\r\nalso made shields of defence, in sword and buckler days.\"\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ of the abele-tree is said to be serviceable as a remedy in\r\nintermittent fevers; and Dioscorides informs us that if it be chopped small\r\nand sowed in rills, well and richly manured, it will yield a plentiful crop\r\nof mushrooms.\r\n\r\n  263. _The ASPEN, or TREMBLING POPLAR_ (Populus tremula), _is a tree which\r\n  grows in moist woods; has nearly circular leaves, toothed and angular at\r\n  the edges, smooth on both sides, and attached to footstalks so long and\r\n  slender as to be shaken by the slightest wind._\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any situation in which the aspen will not flourish, but\r\nit succeeds best where the soil is moist and gravelly. Its _wood_ is light,\r\nporous, soft, and of white colour; and, though inferior in excellence to\r\nthat of the white poplar, is applicable to many useful purposes,\r\nparticularly for field-gates, the frames of pack-saddles, for milk-pails,\r\nclogs, and the wood-work of patterns. It is improper for bedsteads, as it\r\nis liable to be infested by bugs. In some countries the _bark_ of the young\r\ntrees is made into torches.\r\n\r\n  264. _The BLACK POPLAR_ (Populus nigra, Fig. 75) _is a native tree of\r\n  this country, known by its somewhat trowel-shaped leaves, which taper to\r\n  a point, and are serrated, and smooth on both sides._\r\n\r\nThis tree grows rapidly, and attains a considerable size. Its _wood_ is\r\nsoft and light, and in some respects useful to engravers; and is\r\noccasionally sawed into boards, though these are not in general much\r\nesteemed. The _bark_ is so thick and light that it is not unfrequently used\r\nby fishermen as buoys or floats to support their nets. The inhabitants of\r\nKamtschatka dry and pulverise the _inner rind_ of the black poplar-tree,\r\nand use it as an ingredient in bread. The _buds_, when they first appear,\r\nare covered with and contain a viscous and fragrant juice, which may be\r\nadvantageously used in plasters.\r\n\r\n  265. _The LOMBARDY or ITALIAN POPLAR_ (Populus dilatata) _grows wild in\r\n  Lombardy and the northern parts of Italy, and is distinguished by its\r\n  somewhat trowel-shaped and serrated leaves, being smooth on both sides,\r\n  and wider than they are long._\r\n\r\nFrom its slender and perpendicular growth the Lombardy poplar is found\r\nuseful for hop-poles, and may be formed into masts for small vessels. The\r\nwood, which is soft and free from knots, is employed by joiners,\r\ncarpenters, and cartwrights. It is recommended as peculiarly valuable for\r\nthe floors of granaries, some persons believing it so obnoxious to insects\r\nthat weevils will not continue in such granaries. It may be wrought into\r\nvery flexible shafts for carriages, or felloes for wheels; and, not being\r\nliable to split, is peculiarly adapted for packing cases.\r\n\r\nThe growth of this tree is so rapid, and the space of ground which it\r\noccupies is so small, that it is in almost universal request as an\r\nornamental tree, in places that are not sufficiently spacious to admit of\r\ntrees of more spreading form.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  266. _SAGO is a granulated preparation from the pith of a species of\r\n  palm-tree_ (Cycas circinalis) _which grows in India and Africa._\r\n\r\n  _This tree attains the height of thirty or forty feet; has a straight and\r\n  somewhat slender stem, and winged leaves at the summit, each seven or\r\n  eight feet long, with the leaflets long and narrow._\r\n\r\nThe preparation of sago, under different forms, constitutes a principal\r\nsource of employment to the inhabitants of many parts of the coast of\r\nMalabar, as well as those of several of the islands of the East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of the sago-tree contains a farinaceous pith, to obtain which it\r\nis sawn into pieces. After the pith is taken out, it is beaten in mortars,\r\nand, water being poured upon the mass, this is allowed to stand for some\r\nhours to settle; after which it is strained through a coarse cloth, and,\r\nthe finest particles running through with the water, the grosser ones are\r\nleft behind and thrown away, or washed over a hair sieve through which only\r\nthe edible parts can pass. These are allowed to subside. The water is then\r\npoured off, and the flour, being properly dried, is made into cakes and\r\nbaked for use, or is granulated in a manner somewhat similar to that\r\nadopted in the preparation of tapioca (251). It is in the latter state that\r\nsago is imported into Europe, where it is much used as a nourishing and\r\nagreeable diet for sick persons, in puddings and other culinary\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\n  267. _The COMMON JUNIPER_ (Juniperus communis) _is an evergreen shrub,\r\n  with slender and pointed leaves, that grows on heaths in several parts of\r\n  the south of England._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves grow in threes; each is tipped with a spine, and is longer\r\n  than the ripe fruit, which is a blackish purple berry._\r\n\r\nJuniper _berries_ are at first green; and they continue upon the trees two\r\nyears before they become ripe and assume their purple colour. When ripe\r\nthey have a sweetish aromatic taste. The Swedes prepare, from these\r\nberries, a beverage which they consider useful as a medicine; and in some\r\nparts of the Continent juniper berries are roasted, ground, and adopted as\r\na substitute for coffee. In Sweden they are eaten at breakfast, in the form\r\nof a conserve; and, in Germany, they are frequently used as a culinary\r\nspice, and especially for imparting their peculiar flavour to sour crout.\r\nSpirits impregnated with an essential oil distilled from them have the name\r\nof juniper water or _gin_. But it is a common practice to adopt spirit of\r\nturpentine (246) instead of this. Juniper-berries are imported into this\r\ncountry from Holland and Italy. Their smell is strong, but not\r\ndisagreeable; and their flavour is warm, pungent, and sweetish, leaving a\r\nbitter taste in the mouth. The essential oil of these berries, if mixed\r\nwith nut-oil (241), makes an excellent varnish for pictures, woodwork, and\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the juniper-tree is of reddish colour, very hard, and so\r\ndurable that it will last more than a hundred years without decay. It is\r\nemployed in veneering, for making cabinets, and for ornamental furniture.\r\nCharcoal formed from it affords a heat so lasting, that live embers are\r\nsaid to have been found in the ashes of juniper-trees after they have been\r\ncovered up for more than twelve months. Such is the fibrous nature of the\r\n_bark_ that it may be manufactured into ropes and other cordage.\r\n\r\nFrom the crevices of the bark, or through perforations made in it by\r\ninsects, a resinous gum exudes, which has the name of _gum sandarach_.\r\nThis, which is of pale yellowish colour, very brittle, and inflammable,\r\npossesses a pungent aromatic taste, and emits a fragrant odour when burnt.\r\nIt is imported from the Continent, in small pieces or tears, about the size\r\nof peas. When powdered and passed through a fine sieve, this is the\r\nsubstance called _pounce_, which is used for rubbing upon writing paper, in\r\nplaces where it has been scratched. Considerable quantities of this gum are\r\nconsumed in the preparation of varnish, and particularly of one kind, used\r\nby cabinet-makers and painters, called _vernis_.\r\n\r\n  268. _The RED or COMMON CEDAR is a species of juniper_ (Juniperus\r\n  virginiana) _which grows in North America and the West Indies._\r\n\r\n  _It is distinguished by its leaves growing in threes, and being fixed by\r\n  their base, the younger ones lying upon each other, and the older ones\r\n  spreading._\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of this tree is in much request for the outsides of black lead\r\npencils. It is soft and incapable of high polish, but, on account of its\r\npowerful fragrance, and consequently resisting the attacks of insects, it\r\nnot unfrequently used for the bottoms of drawers, and the inside of\r\ncabinets. Some years ago it was in much request for wainscotting and\r\ncabinet work; but, since the introduction of mahogany, it has been in great\r\nmeasure neglected for these purposes.\r\n\r\n  269. _The YEW is a well-known evergreen tree_ (Taxus baccata), _which has\r\n  dark, narrow, pointed, and prickly leaves, and red berries, in the hollow\r\n  part of the extremity of which a green seed appears._\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the yew was formerly very extensive throughout nearly\r\nthe whole of the British dominions, since of the _wood_ of this tree, which\r\nis peculiarly hard, smooth, and tough, our ancestors manufactured their\r\nbows. Hence, as well as on account of its gloomy and funereal aspect, it\r\nwas usually planted in churchyards. But, when the introduction of fire-arms\r\nbegan to supersede the use of the bow, the yew was no longer cultivated\r\nthan as an ornamental tree in parks and pleasure grounds.\r\n\r\nIn the formal style of gardening which was anciently prevalent, few trees\r\nwere more the subject of admiration than this, from its bearing to be\r\nclipped, without injury, into almost any form. Yews were cut into the shape\r\nof men, quadrupeds, birds, ships, and other vegetable monsters, but such\r\nabsurd fancies have of late years almost wholly disappeared. These trees\r\nare at present advantageously planted in hedges, as a fence for orchards\r\nand shrubberies, which nothing can injure.\r\n\r\nThe _wood_ of the yew-tree is hard, beautifully veined, and susceptible of\r\nhigh polish. Hence it is valuable as a wood for veneering, and is much used\r\nfor card boxes, small cabinets, and other articles. It is frequently used\r\nby turners and cabinet-makers; and might perhaps be advantageously\r\nsubstituted for box (232) by engravers and other artists in that wood. From\r\nits hardness and durability, it may be made into cogs for mill-wheels, into\r\naxle-trees, and flood-gates for fish-ponds, which are scarcely susceptible\r\nof decay. The _berries_ are sweet and clammy, and are often eaten by\r\nchildren without inconvenience; though when eaten to excess, and\r\nparticularly if the stones be swallowed, they are injurious. An ardent\r\nspirit might no doubt be obtained from them by distillation. The _leaves_\r\nof the yew-tree are extremely poisonous both to the human species and to\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XXIII.--POLYGAMIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOECIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  270. _The PLANTAIN-TREE_ (Musa paradisiaca), _which is much cultivated in\r\n  the West Indies and South America, has a soft stem, fifteen or twenty\r\n  feel high, with several leaves on the summit; and bears a fruit of pale\r\n  yellow colour, somewhat shaped like a cucumber, about a foot in length,\r\n  and two inches thick._\r\n\r\n  _The leaves are frequently eight feet long, and more than two feet broad,\r\n  and are so thin and tender that they are often torn by the wind. The\r\n  fruit is produced in bunches so large as each to weigh forty pounds and\r\n  upwards._\r\n\r\nTo the negroes of the West Indian islands the plantain is an invaluable\r\nfruit, and, like bread to the Europeans, is with them denominated the staff\r\nof life. In Jamaica alone many thousand acres are planted with these trees.\r\nThis fruit is usually gathered before it is ripe, and, after the skin has\r\nbeen peeled off, is roasted for a little while in a clear fire; it is then\r\nscraped and eaten as bread, for which it is an excellent substitute.\r\nPlantains are sometimes boiled, and eaten with salt meat; they are also cut\r\ninto slices and fried, pounded, and made into puddings, and used in various\r\nother ways. Horses, cattle, swine, and other domestic animals, are fattened\r\nwith them. When ripe they may be eaten raw, and, in this state, they have\r\nsomewhat the taste of a ripe pear.\r\n\r\nThe _leaves_ of the plantain-tree, being soft and smooth, are sometimes\r\nemployed as dressings after blisters; and, when green, are used as food for\r\nhogs.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of this tree is so rapid that if a line or thread be drawn\r\nacross, and on a level with the top of one of the leaves, when it begins to\r\nexpand, it will be seen, in the course of an hour, to have grown nearly an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n  271. _The BANANA is a valuable plant_ (Musa sapientum) _which grows in\r\n  the West Indies and other tropical countries, and has leaves about six\r\n  feet in length, and a foot broad in the middle; and fruit four or five\r\n  inches long, and about the shape of a cucumber._\r\n\r\nWhen ripe, the banana is an agreeable _fruit_, with a soft and luscious\r\npulp; and is frequently introduced in desserts in the West Indies. The\r\nSpaniards have a superstitious dislike to cut this fruit across; they\r\nalways slice it from end to end, because, in the former case, the section\r\npresents an imaginary resemblance to the instruments of our Saviour's\r\ncrucifixion. The banana is sometimes fried in slices as fritters. If the\r\npulp of this fruit be squeezed through a fine sieve, it may be formed into\r\nsmall loaves, which, after having been properly dried, may be kept for a\r\ngreat length of time.\r\n\r\n  272. _MILLET is a small yellowish seed of a grassy plant_ (Holcus\r\n  sorghum), _with large and compact stalks which rise to the height of\r\n  seven or eight feet, and is much cultivated in several parts of India and\r\n  Africa._\r\n\r\nIn some countries millet _seed_ is ground into flour and converted into\r\nbread; but this is brown and heavy. It is, however, useful in other\r\nrespects as food, and is an excellent seed for the fattening of poultry. A\r\ngood vinegar has been made from it, by fermentation; and, on distillation,\r\nit yields a strong spirit. Millet seed is imported into this country from\r\nthe East Indies, for the purpose chiefly of puddings; and, by many persons,\r\nit is preferred to rice. The _stalks_ of the millet plant, if subjected to\r\nthe same process that is adopted with the sugar-cane, yield a sweet juice,\r\nfrom which an excellent kind of sugar may be made.\r\n\r\n  273. _GUM ARABIC is a well-known drug, obtained from a tree_ (Mimosa\r\n  nilotica) _which grows in Egypt._\r\n\r\n  _This tree has leaves doubly winged, with spines at the base, and small\r\n  flowers, of globular shape, growing four or five together on slender\r\n  footstalks._\r\n\r\nThe principal supply of gum arabic in this country is obtained from\r\nBarbary, Turkey, and the Persian Gulf. The average quantity imported from\r\nthe Persian Gulf, betwixt 1804 and 1808, was about 7500 hundred weight per\r\nannum, and the price for which it was vended at the East India Company's\r\nsales was about 3_l._ per hundred weight. It used formerly to be packed in\r\nskins, but it is now brought in large casks. The trees which yield it grow\r\nabundantly in numerous parts of Africa and Asia, but the gum does not\r\nfreely exude from them except in tropical regions. It issues from clefts in\r\nthe bark, in the same manner as the gum of the cherry and plum trees of our\r\norchards and gardens: and, by exposure to the air, it soon becomes hard and\r\nsolid. We are informed that, in some parts of Egypt, the inhabitants\r\nprocure this gum, by boiling pieces of the roots of the trees, and\r\nafterwards separating it from the water. We receive gum arabic in small\r\nirregular masses, or rough pieces, of pale yellowish colour, and roundish\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to be remarked, that, by far the greatest part of the gum\r\nwhich is sold in the shops under this name is not such, but is the\r\nproduction of another species of tree (_Mimosa Senegal_), and is properly\r\ncalled _gum Senegal_, The latter is imported from Senegal, Guinea, and\r\nother parts of Africa. It is generally seen in large rough pieces, of\r\nroundish figure, and brownish hue, more or less pure; possesses similar\r\nproperties to the other, and is much cheaper.\r\n\r\nOn account of their mucilaginous qualities, these two kinds of gum, under\r\nthe name of gum arabic, were formerly used for several purposes in\r\nmedicine; and, in coughs and hoarsenesses, were considered of great\r\nservice. They are now principally in request by the manufacturers of\r\nwater-colours; by dyers, and artificers of different kinds. In Africa the\r\nlatter constitutes a principal ingredient in the food of the inhabitants.\r\nThey sometimes dissolve it in milk: and this solution of it is esteemed a\r\nfavourite repast by some of the tribes.\r\n\r\nThe dried _juice_ of the _unripe fruit_ of Egyptian mimosa is called\r\n_acacia_, and is to this day much used in medicine by the Egyptians. It is\r\nsometimes imported into this country in roundish masses, wrapped in thin\r\nbladders; and is externally of deep brown colour, and of a yellowish or\r\nreddish brown within.\r\n\r\n  274. _MYRRH is a gummy, resinous substance, obtained from a tree which\r\n  grows in Abyssinia, Arabia, and other countries of the East, but\r\n  respecting which we are hitherto possessed of no certain account. Mr.\r\n  Bruce, however, imagined it to be a species of mimosa._\r\n\r\nThis drug is generally imported in a kind of grains, of irregular form; of\r\nbrownish or reddish yellow colour, and somewhat transparent. Its smell is\r\naromatic; and its taste is pungent and bitter. In its medicinal effects,\r\nmyrrh, when taken into the stomach, is supposed to warm and strengthen it,\r\nand also to strengthen the other viscera. It is believed to resist\r\nputrefaction in all parts of the body; and, hence, has been recommended as\r\na medicine in malignant, putrid, and pestilential fevers; and in small-pox.\r\n\r\nAt the East India Company's sales this drug is sold at the rate of about\r\ntwenty pounds per hundred weight. It is, however, liable to great abuses.\r\nThe larger masses, in particular, are frequently an artificial composition,\r\nskilfully incrusted with a coat of myrrh.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIOECIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  275. _MANNA is a concrete or dried juice, procured from several species\r\n  of ash-tree, but particularly from the_ FLOWERING ASH (Fraxinus ornus,\r\n  Fig. 76), _which is much cultivated in Calabria and Sicily._\r\n\r\n  _This tree somewhat resembles the common ash. It has winged leaves, with\r\n  an odd one at the end, the leaflets oblong, pointed, serrated, and\r\n  veined, standing on footstalks, and of bright green colour. The flowers\r\n  are whitish, and appear in close bunches, about the month of May or\r\n  June._\r\n\r\nThe trees that are cultivated for the production of manna are chiefly\r\nplanted on the eastern sides of hills. This substance exudes spontaneously\r\nfrom them; but as the supply thus obtained would be insufficient for the\r\ndemand, incisions are made in the bark to obtain it more copiously. These\r\nincisions are formed, in the summer time, lengthwise in the tree, and each\r\nabout a span long. They are begun at the lower part of the trunk, and\r\nrepeated upward, at a little distance from each other, as high as the\r\nbranches. One side of the tree is first cut; the other side being reserved\r\nuntil the ensuing year, when it undergoes a similar treatment. From the\r\nwounds thus made a thick whitish juice immediately begins to flow, which\r\ngradually hardens on the bark, and in the course of a few days acquires a\r\nsufficient consistence to be taken off. It is collected in baskets, and\r\nafterwards packed in chests or boxes. Sometimes the manna flows in such\r\nabundance that it runs upon the ground, and thus becomes mixed with various\r\nimpurities, unless it be prevented, as is sometimes the case, by placing\r\nfor its reception large leaves, stones, chips of wood, or straw. The\r\ncollecting of manna generally terminates about the end of September.\r\n\r\nThis substance is known by druggists under different names, according to\r\nits purity, rather than from any essential difference in the article\r\nitself. The best Calabrian manna is imported in oblong, light, and crumbly\r\nflakes or pieces of whitish or pale yellow colour, and somewhat transparent\r\nappearance. The inferior sorts are moist, unctuous, and of darker colour.\r\n\r\nManna is a mild and agreeable laxative medicine, particularly with the\r\naddition of a little cinnamon water, or other warm aromatic: and it is\r\nuseful in asthmatic complaints, as well as in inflammatory affections of\r\nthe breast. It is sometimes counterfeited by a composition of sugar and\r\nhoney, mixed with a small portion of scammony.\r\n\r\nThe miraculous substance mentioned in the Old Testament by the name of\r\nmanna, cannot, of course, be considered to have any alliance whatever with\r\nthe manna thus produced. This remark would not have been made, did not\r\nyoung persons sometimes inconsiderately confound the two substances.\r\n\r\n  276. _The ASH-TREE_ (Fraxinus excelsior, Fig. 79) _is a well-known\r\n  British tree, with winged leaves; the leaflets in four or five pairs,\r\n  with an odd one, serrated, and without footstalks; and the flowers\r\n  without petals._\r\n\r\nOf late years this valuable tree has been much planted in several parts of\r\nEngland. It is of hardy nature, and thrives even in barren soils. If\r\nplanted in moist situations, the roots, spreading wide in every direction\r\nnear the surface, have a tendency to render the ground dry and firm. The\r\n_timber_, which has the rare advantage of being nearly as good when young\r\nas when old, is white, and so hard and tough as generally to be esteemed\r\nnext in value to oak. It is much used by coach-makers, wheel-wrights, and\r\ncart-wrights; and is made into ploughs, axle-trees, felloes of wheels,\r\nharrows, ladders, and other implements of husbandry. It is likewise used by\r\nship-builders for various purposes, and by coopers for the hoops of tubs\r\nand barrels. Where, by frequent cutting, the wood has become knotty,\r\nirregular, and veined, it is in much request for cabinet-work by mechanics\r\non the Continent. The best season for felling ash-trees is from November to\r\nFebruary. As fuel, this tree burns better whilst wet and green than other\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nWe are informed that, in the northern parts of Lancashire, when grass is\r\nscarce, the small farmers frequently cut off the tops of ash-trees to feed\r\ntheir cows with the _leaves_ and tender branches; but these are said to\r\nspoil the taste of the milk. Mr. Pennant states that, in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, the inhabitants of Colton and Hawkshead-Fells remonstrated\r\nagainst the number of forges then lately erected in that part of the\r\ncountry, because they consumed the loppings of the trees, which formed the\r\nsole winter food for their cattle. The leaves of ash-trees were formerly\r\nmuch used in the adulteration of tea, under the name of _smouch_; but this\r\npractice has of late been prohibited by act of parliament.\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ of the ash-tree is employed in the tanning of calf-skins, and\r\nsometimes in dyeing black and other colours. The _inner bark_ has been\r\nproposed as a substitute for Peruvian bark, in the cure of intermittent\r\nfevers.\r\n\r\n  277. _EBONY is the wood of a species of palm-tree_ (Diospiros ebenum),\r\n  _which grows in the island of Ceylon, and has smooth, leathery, oblong,\r\n  and pointed leaves, and rough-haired buds._\r\n\r\nThe black and valuable substance known to us by the name of ebony, is the\r\ncentre part only of the trees. The outside wood is white and soft, and\r\neither decays soon, or is destroyed by insects, which leave the black part\r\nuntouched. Ebony is imported into this country from the East Indies. It is\r\nexceedingly hard and heavy, admits of being highly polished, and is\r\nprincipally used by cabinet-makers and inlayers for the veneering of\r\ncabinets and other ornamental work. The wood of the pear-tree, stained\r\nblack, is frequently substituted for ebony.\r\n\r\nThe ripe _fruit_ of the ebony tree is eaten by the natives of Ceylon; but\r\nit is astringent, and not very palatable.\r\n\r\nLinnæus was of opinion that ebony was the wood of a shrub (_ebenus\r\ncretica_) which grows in the island of Crete, and has silky leaves and\r\nrose-coloured flowers.\r\n\r\n  278. _The PAWPAW is a fruit about the size of a small melon, but of very\r\n  various shape, the production of a species of palm-tree_ (carica papaya),\r\n  _which grows in tropical climates, both of the eastern and western parts\r\n  of the world._\r\n\r\n  _The tree is twenty feet and upwards in height; naked almost to the\r\n  summit; and marked, through its whole length, with the scars of fallen\r\n  leaves. Its leaves are on foot-stalks two feet in length, and deeply\r\n  divided into seven, nine, or eleven large lobes. The flowers are\r\n  axillary, white, and sweet scented._\r\n\r\nIn shape the _fruit_ of the pawpaw-tree is sometimes angular, and flattened\r\nat both ends; sometimes oval or round; and sometimes pyramidal. When ripe\r\nit is of yellow colour; and contains a yellow succulent pulp, of sweetish\r\ntaste, and aromatic smell, with many black or brown and furrowed seeds.\r\nThis fruit is seldom eaten raw, but when boiled it is esteemed a wholesome\r\nsauce for fresh meat. The inhabitants of the countries where it is found\r\nsometimes preserve it in sugar, with oranges, and small citrons. Thus\r\nprepared, it may be kept a long time; and, in this state, it is not\r\nunfrequently brought into Europe. When about half grown, the pawpaw is\r\nsometimes pickled in vinegar with spices.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the trifid-fruited custard apple (_annona triloba_) is called\r\npawpaw in some parts of America.\r\n\r\nThe _bark_ of the pawpaw-tree is manufactured by the Indians into cordage.\r\nThe _leaves_ are used in place of soap; and water-pipes are sometimes made\r\nof the _stem_ of the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIOECIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  279. _The FIG is the pulpy fruit of a shrub, or low tree_ (Ficus carica,\r\n  Fig. 83), _which is a native of the South of Europe, and some parts of\r\n  Asia._\r\n\r\n  _Fig-trees are branched from the bottom, and the leaves are large,\r\n  smooth, and irregularly divided into from three to five deep and rounded\r\n  lobes. The fruit grows on short and thick stalks, of purplish colour, and\r\n  contains a soft, sweet, and fragrant pulp, intermixed with numerous small\r\n  seeds._\r\n\r\nIt appears from history, both sacred and profane, that the fig-tree was an\r\nobject of attention in the earliest times. This fruit was one of the most\r\ncommon and favourite aliments of the ancient Greeks, and constituted a very\r\nvaluable food with the peasants of some parts of Italy. Fig-trees are now\r\nmuch cultivated in Turkey, Italy, and the Levant, as well as in Spain and\r\nsome of the southern parts of France. All the islands of the Archipelago\r\nyield figs in abundance, but these are in general of very inferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe trees are propagated either by suckers, by layers, or by cuttings; and\r\nthe process of increasing and ripening the fruit is an art which requires\r\nmuch attention. This, as it is practised in the Levant, is called\r\n_caprification_, and is performed by wounding the buds of the figs, with a\r\nstraw or feather dipped in sweet oil at a certain period of their growth.\r\n\r\nFigs are dried either by a furnace or in the sun, after having been dipped\r\nin a scalding ley made of the ashes of the fig-tree. In this state they are\r\nused both in medicine, and as food; and are considered more wholesome and\r\nmore easy of digestion than when fresh. They form a considerable branch of\r\ncommerce, and are exported, in boxes of different size and shape, to nearly\r\nall the northern parts of Europe. When we receive them, their surface is\r\nusually covered with a saccharine matter which has exuded from the fruit. A\r\nsmall and cheap kind of fig is imported in small frails or baskets from\r\nFaro.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous varieties of the fig, but the common purple kind is the\r\nhardiest of the whole. This is frequently cultivated in our gardens; and,\r\nif screened from the north-east winds, it ripens, even: with us, in\r\ntolerable perfection.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the fig-tree is of spongy texture, and, when charged with oil\r\nand emery, is much used on the Continent by locksmiths, gun-smiths, and\r\nother artificers in iron and steel, to polish their work. It is almost\r\nindestructible, and on this account was formerly employed in eastern\r\ncountries as coffins for embalmed bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCLASS XXIV.--CRYPTOGAMIA.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\n  280. _FERN, or BRAKE_ (Pteris aquilina), _is a well-known cryptogamous\r\n  plant, which grows wild on heaths, in woods, and in barren places._\r\n\r\nThough this plant is an extremely troublesome weed to the farmer, from the\r\nroots penetrating deep into the ground, it is applied to various uses in\r\nrural oeconomy. When cut and properly dried, it serves as litter for horses\r\nand cattle; and it supplies the place of thatch for covering the roofs of\r\ncottages and stacks. Where coal is scarce, it is used for the heating of\r\novens and burning of lime-stone.\r\n\r\nThe _ashes_ of fern, from their yielding a tolerably pure alkali, are\r\nfrequently used by manufacturers of glass, particularly in France. And, in\r\nsome parts of our own country, the poor people mix these ashes with water,\r\nand form them into round masses which they call _fern balls_. These are\r\nafterwards heated in a fire, and then, with water, are made into a ley for\r\nthe scouring of linen. They thus furnish a cheap substitute for soap.\r\n\r\nSwine are fond of the roots of fern, and will feed freely upon them. We are\r\neven informed that, with the inhabitants of Palma, one of the Canary\r\nislands, they are sometimes made to supply the place of bread.\r\n\r\nIt is deserving of remark that, when the root of the fern is cut obliquely\r\nacross, it presents a kind of figure of the Imperial or Russian eagle; from\r\nwhich circumstance Linnæus was induced to name it _Pteris aquilina_, or\r\n\"Eagle brake.\"\r\n\r\n  281. _The_ LICHENS _constitute a very numerous family of plants, which\r\n  grow on the bark of trees, on rocks, stones, and other substances; and\r\n  have an indistinct fructification, in scattered wart-like tubercles, or\r\n  excrescences, and smooth saucers or shields, in which the seeds are\r\n  imbedded._\r\n\r\n  _Some of them have a powdery appearance, and others are crustaceous,\r\n  leaf-like, shrub-like, herbaceous, or gelatinous._\r\n\r\n  282. _The CALCAREOUS LICHEN_ (Lichen calcareus) _consists of a white\r\n  crust with black tubercles._\r\n\r\nThis plant, which is found on lime-stone rocks in Wales, and the north of\r\nEngland, is used in dyeing woollen and other cloths a scarlet colour.\r\n\r\n  283. _CRAB'S-EYE LICHEN_ (Lichen parellus) _is a crustaceous, whitish,\r\n  and granulated vegetable substance, with cups of the same colour, which\r\n  have a thick and blunt border._\r\n\r\nFrom this lichen, which is found on rocks and stones in mountainous\r\ncountries, and sometimes on stones near the sea-shore, is prepared the\r\nbluish pigment called _litmus_. It is chiefly collected from rocks in the\r\nnorth of England, packed in casks, and sent to London for sale.\r\n\r\n  284. _TARTAREOUS LICHEN_ (Lichen tartareus) _is a whitish, crustaceous,\r\n  vegetable production, with yellow cups or shields, which have a whitish\r\n  border._\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Highlands of Scotland gather this species of lichen\r\nfrom the rocks, and, after cleaning, and some further preparation, which is\r\nkept a secret by the manufacturers, they form it into cakes. These, when\r\ndried, are pulverized, and sold to dyers by the name of _cudbear_, which is\r\na corruption of Cuthbert, the name of its inventor. In conjunction with\r\nalum, the powder of the tartareous lichen is used in dyeing scarlet, and\r\nalso for striking a purple dye; but the colour produced by it is not very\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\n  285. _ARCHELL, or PURPLE ROCK LICHEN_ (Lichen omphalodes), _is a\r\n  vegetable production, of somewhat crustaceous consistence, and leaf-like\r\n  form; the segments with many lobes, and of dark purplish brown colour,\r\n  with dull purple saucers._\r\n\r\nThis kind of lichen grows upon rocks on the high stony moors of several\r\nparts of England, Wales, and Scotland. When properly prepared, it imparts\r\nto woollen cloth a reddish brown colour, or a dull but durable crimson. If\r\nwool that has been dyed with it be dipped into a blue vat, it will acquire\r\na beautiful purple tinge. It is sometimes used as a styptic; and was\r\nformerly applied as a remedy in inflammatory fevers and other complaints;\r\nbut, in the latter respect, it is now entirely neglected.\r\n\r\n  286. _ORCHALL, or DYER'S LICHEN_ (Lichen rocella), _is a somewhat\r\n  crustaceous and shrub-like vegetable production, of nearly cylindrical\r\n  form, solid, without leaves, but little branched, and with blackish brown\r\n  alternate tubercles._\r\n\r\nIn the Canary and Cape de Verd Islands, as well as in the Grecian\r\nArchipelago, orchall is found in great abundance. It likewise grows in\r\nGuernsey and in some parts of England, and is employed by dyers chiefly for\r\ngiving a bloom to other colours. This is effected by passing the dyed cloth\r\nor silk through hot water slightly impregnated with it; but the bloom thus\r\ncommunicated soon decays after it has been exposed to the air. When\r\nprepared in a peculiar manner, orchall yields a rich purple tincture,\r\nfugitive indeed, but very beautiful. Mixed with a solution of tin it is\r\nsaid to dye a permanent scarlet. Orchall is the substance generally adopted\r\nfor colouring the spirits of thermometers. And it is a remarkable\r\ncircumstance that, as exposure to the air destroys its colour upon cloth,\r\nso the exclusion of the air produces, in a few years, a like effect upon\r\nthe fluid in those tubes; but on breaking the tubes the colour is restored.\r\n\r\n  287. _ICELAND LICHEN_ (Lichen islandicus) _is a leafy, membranous,\r\n  vegetable production, of brownish green colour, jagged at the edges, and\r\n  fringed, having large and purplish brown saucers or shields._\r\n\r\nThe name of this lichen is derived from that of the island in which it\r\nchiefly grows. It is, however, also found in the Highlands of Scotland, and\r\nin some of the northern parts both of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nIt abounds with nutritious mucilage; and, after having been steeped in\r\nwater to extract its bitter and laxative qualities, it is sometimes used as\r\nmedicine in coughs and consumptions. One ounce of Iceland lichen, boiled in\r\na pint of water, yields about seven ounces of mucilage. The inhabitants of\r\nIceland prepare from it a kind of gruel, which they mix with milk. They\r\nalso boil it in several waters, and then dry and make it into bread. In\r\nGermany a durable brown dye is made by means of it; and, under another mode\r\nof preparation, it imparts an excellent black tinge to white woollen yarn.\r\n\r\n  288. _BLADDER FUCUS_ (Fucus vesiculosus) _is a species of sea-weed, of\r\n  flat shape, with a middle rib, the edges entire, forked, and sometimes\r\n  tumid at the ends, and furnished with several air bladders imbedded in\r\n  the substance of the plant._\r\n\r\nBy far the most important application of this, one of the commonest of all\r\nour marine plants, is for the making of _kelp_, which, in Scotland, affords\r\nemployment to many industrious families. So lucrative and so highly\r\nesteemed is the bladder fucus, and some other plants nearly allied to it,\r\nthat the natives of several parts of the Western Islands have rolled large\r\nmasses of stone into the sea, with a view to promote and extend their\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of kelp these plants are dried, by exposure for some\r\ntime to the sun and air. They are then burnt by degrees in a kelp furnace,\r\nwhich is generally a round hole dug in the earth. When the furnace is\r\nnearly filled with the remains of the burnt sea-weeds, the whole is briskly\r\nagitated with a rake or hook, till it is compacted, or becomes of a shining\r\nglutinous consistence, in appearance not unlike melted iron. It is then\r\nallowed to cool, and is afterwards placed in storehouses for exportation.\r\nIn this state it is an impure kind of carbonat of soda. In the Orkney\r\nIslands every consideration is sacrificed to the making of kelp, nearly\r\n3,000 tons of which are annually sent to market and sold at Leith,\r\nNewcastle, and other places, at the rate of from seven to ten pounds per\r\nton of twenty-one hundred weight.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Gothland boil this plant with coarse meal, as food for\r\nswine; and the poorer classes of Scania thatch their cottages with it, and\r\nalso employ it as fuel. In the Hebrides it is customary to dry cheese,\r\nwithout using any salt, by covering it with the ashes of the bladder fucus,\r\nwhich abound in saline particles. This and other sea-weeds serve as a\r\nwinter food for cattle, which regularly frequent the shores for them at the\r\nebb of the tide: they are also used as manure for land.\r\n\r\nA soapy liquor which is found in the bladders of this plant is sometimes\r\nexternally applied as a medicine for dispersing scrofulous and scorbutic\r\nswellings, by simply bruising them in the hand and rubbing them on the\r\nparts affected. When this plant is calcined or burnt in the open air, a\r\nblack and saline powder is produced, which, under the name of _vegetable\r\næthiops_, has been recommended as a dentrifice, and for other uses.\r\n\r\n  289. _EATABLE WINGED FUCUS, or BLADDERLOCKS_ (Fucus esculentus), _is a\r\n  simple, undivided, and sword-shaped sea-weed, which is olive-coloured,\r\n  and sometime several yards in length_. _Its stem is four-cornered, runs\r\n  through the whole length of the leaf, and is winged at the base._\r\n\r\nThis plant, which is very common on some of the shores of Scotland, and\r\nalso on those of Cornwall, and several parts of North Wales, is a grateful\r\nfood to cattle; and its stalk, when boiled, constitutes a very favourite\r\ndish in Scotland. The proper season for gathering it is the month of\r\nSeptember, when it is in higher perfection than at any other time of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n  290. _SWEET FUCUS_ (Fucus saccharinus) _is a simple, undivided, and\r\n  sword-shaped sea-weed, without any rib, of leathery consistence, and\r\n  tawny green colour; and frequently five or six feet in length_. _Its\r\n  stalk is round and hard._\r\n\r\nThis plant abounds on all our sea-shores: and, if slightly washed from the\r\nsea-water, and dried in the air, it becomes covered with a sweet powdery\r\nefflorescence. It is edible either in a raw state, or boiled as a pot-herb.\r\nSometimes it is hung up to serve the purpose of an hygrometer, which it\r\ndoes in some degree by becoming flaccid during a moist state of the\r\natmosphere, and hard in dry weather.\r\n\r\n  291. _DULSE, or RED PALMATE FUCUS_ (Fucus palmatus), _is a flat,\r\n  membranous, and hand-shaped, sea-weed, of brownish crimson colour, smooth\r\n  on both sides, and without any mid-rib._\r\n\r\nIn the markets of Edinburgh, and other parts of Scotland, this plant, which\r\nis common on most of the British shores, is exposed for sale as an article\r\nof food. After having been washed in fresh water, it is eaten raw, by\r\nitself, in salad, or by poor people with other provisions. Sometimes it is\r\nboiled and used as a pot-herb. If gradually dried, it gives out a whitish\r\npowdery substance, which covers the whole plant, and has a sweet and\r\nagreeable taste, somewhat resembling that of violets. In this state it is\r\nfrequently packed in casks for exportation. Some persons chew it as\r\ntobacco. In Scotland it is occasionally used as a medicine, and it is\r\nsupposed to sweeten the breath and destroy worms.\r\n\r\n  292. _GREEN or EDIBLE LAVER_ (Ulva lactuca) _is a thin, membranous,\r\n  pellucid, and green vegetable substance, which is found on rocks, stones,\r\n  and shells, in the sea and salt-water ditches in nearly all parts of\r\n  Great Britain._\r\n\r\nOf late years this plant, stewed with lemon juice, has been introduced to\r\nthe tables of the luxurious, as a sauce to be eaten with roast meat. Though\r\nin a recent state it has a salt and bitterish flavour, and even when thus\r\nprepared is not always relished at first, yet by habit most persons become\r\npartial to it. The laver which is consumed in London is chiefly prepared in\r\nthe west of England, and packed in pots in a state ready for the table.\r\nSome persons use laver medicinally, and it is esteemed wholesome for\r\nscrofulous habits; but it can scarcely be taken in sufficient quantity to\r\ndo much good, without having too strong an effect on the bowels.\r\n\r\n  293. _The MORELL_ (Phallus esculentus, Fig. 84) _is a kind of fungus with\r\n  a naked and wrinkled stem, and an egg-shaped head, full of cells on its\r\n  external surface._\r\n\r\nAs an ingredient for thickening and heightening the flavour of sauces and\r\nsoups, morells, which are chiefly found in woods and hedges in a loamy\r\nsoil, are in great esteem. For this purpose, after they are gathered, they\r\nare strung upon pack-thread to be dried; and, when dry, they may be kept\r\nwithout injury for many months.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the persons employed in gathering morells found that they\r\nalways grew most abundantly in woods that had been burnt: and, with a view\r\nof promoting their increase, they were accustomed to set fire to the woods,\r\nuntil this practice was prohibited by the Government. Useful and palatable\r\nas these plants are, it has been ascertained that, if gathered after having\r\nbeen exposed for some days to wet weather, they are extremely pernicious.\r\n\r\n  294. _The TRUFFLE_ (Tuber cibarium) _is a globular, solid, and warty\r\n  fungus, without root, which grows at the depth of four or five inches\r\n  beneath the surface of the earth, and is from the size of a pea to that\r\n  of a potatoe._\r\n\r\nThis, one of the best of the edible funguses, is chiefly found in hilly\r\nwoods and pastures, which have a sandy or clayey bottom; and occurs on the\r\ndowns of Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Kent. Truffles are generally discovered\r\nby means of dogs, which are taught to hunt for them by scent; and wherever\r\nthey smell one of them, they bark, and scratch it up. In Italy they are\r\nhunted, in somewhat similar manner, by pigs.\r\n\r\nTruffles are either served at table roasted in a fresh state like potatoes,\r\nor they are cut into slices and dried, as an ingredient for sauces and\r\nsoups. Those that are most delicious are internally of white colour, and\r\nhave somewhat the odour of garlic.\r\n\r\nIn England truffles seldom exceed the weight of four or five ounces; whilst\r\non the Continent they are known to weigh as much as fifteen or sixteen\r\nounces each.\r\n\r\n  295. _The PUFF-BALL_ (Lycoperdon bovista) _is a round kind of fungus,\r\n  which is filled with a soft whitish flesh when young, and a fine brown\r\n  powder when ripe._\r\n\r\nThe _powder_ of the puff-ball is sometimes used as a styptic, to prevent\r\nthe bleeding of recent wounds. This powder is extremely subtile, and is\r\nvery injurious to the eyes. Instances have occurred of persons who, having\r\nhad it blown into their face, have thereby been deprived of their sight for\r\na considerable time; and have also been affected with violent pain and\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious experiment of taking a shilling from the bottom of a\r\nvessel of water, without wetting the hand. This is said to be effected by\r\nstrewing a small quantity of the dust of the puff-ball on the surface; it\r\nso strongly repels the fluid as to form a covering for the fingers, and\r\ndefend them from the contact of the water.\r\n\r\nThe fumes of the puff-ball, when burnt, have a powerfully narcotic quality;\r\nand, on this account, they are sometimes used to take the combs from hives\r\nwithout destroying the bees.\r\n\r\n  296. _The COMMON MUSHROOM_ (Agaricus campestris) _is a fungus consisting\r\n  of a white cylindrical stalk and a convex cover of white or brownish\r\n  colour, which has beneath an irregular arrangement of gills, pinky when\r\n  young, but afterwards of dark liver colour._\r\n\r\n  _When it first appears above ground the mushroom is smooth and nearly\r\n  globular, and in this state it is called a_ button.\r\n\r\nIn England mushrooms are in great demand for the table. They are found wild\r\nin parks, and other pastures where the turf has not been ploughed for many\r\nyears; and the best time for gathering them is in the months of August and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThey are eaten fresh, either stewed or broiled; and are preserved for use\r\neither by drying, by being pickled, or in powder. They are also employed in\r\nmaking the well-known sauce called mushroom ketchup. As an article of food,\r\nhowever, mushrooms are by no means wholesome, being so tough, and having so\r\ngreat a resemblance to soft leather, as to be almost indigestible. This is\r\nparticularly the case when they are of large size.\r\n\r\nMushrooms may be raised artificially on beds constructed for the purpose,\r\neven in cellars; for if they have only warmth and moisture, the plants will\r\nvegetate without light; but the most proper situations for them are under\r\nsheds in the open air. The plants thus grown, however, have more toughness\r\nthan such as grow wild in the fields; and, in other respects, are much\r\ninferior to them.\r\n\r\n297. There is a kind of mushroom (_Agaricus georgii_) which is yellowish,\r\nwith yellowish white gills, and when full grown is sometimes so large as to\r\nmeasure eighteen inches across. This is occasionally eaten, but, in many\r\ninstances, the use of it has been attended with injurious consequences.\r\n\r\n298. In Covent Garden market a tall and spongy kind of mushroom (_Agaricus\r\nprocerus_), with white gills, and a large horizontal ring round the stem,\r\nis frequently exposed for sale about the month of September.\r\n\r\n299. On hedge-banks, in pastures, and in what are called fairy-rings, there\r\nis a species of mushroom (_Agaricus orcades_), with brownish or watery\r\nwhite gills, two or four in a set, a pale brown, convex, and irregular\r\ncover, and a whitish stem. These are considered by many persons to be the\r\n_champignons_ of the French cooks. They have a much higher flavour than the\r\ncommon mushroom: but from their leathery nature are indigestible, except in\r\nthe form of powder, with sauces, or in ketchup, in all of which they are\r\nvery admirable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the plants of the mushroom tribe, it ought to be observed\r\nthat, though several of them are edible, many are extremely poisonous.\r\nInstances of the fatal effects arising from an indiscriminate adoption of\r\nthem are innumerable. Great caution, therefore, is requisite that such only\r\nshall be used as are ascertained to be wholesome, particularly as, in many\r\ninstances, the poisonous species can scarcely be distinguished by the eye\r\nfrom such as are innoxious. In cases of injury arising from poisonous\r\nfunguses, the best remedy that can be administered is an emetic.\r\n\r\n  300. _SPUNK, or TOUCHWOOD_ (Boletus igniarius), _is a fungus somewhat\r\n  shaped like a horse's hoof, with pores on the under side, and the upper\r\n  part very hard and smooth, but marked with circular bands or ridges of\r\n  different colours._\r\n\r\n  _It grows horizontally on the trunks and large branches of several kinds\r\n  of trees, when old and decayed._\r\n\r\nIn Germany, and in some parts of England, this fungus is used as tinder,\r\nfor which, on account of its readily catching fire, it is well adapted. It\r\nis prepared by being boiled in a strong ley, dried, and again boiled in a\r\nsolution of salt-petre. In Franconia pieces of the inner substance of the\r\nspunk are beaten so as to resemble leather, and are sewed together for\r\nmaking garments. The inhabitants of Lapland frequently burn it about their\r\ncottages, to keep off a species of gad-fly which is peculiarly injurious to\r\nthe young rein-deer.\r\n\r\nThis fungus is often employed as a styptic for the stopping of blood. When\r\nintended for this use, the exterior hard substance is pared off, and the\r\ncoat underneath is separated from the porous part, and well beaten with a\r\nhammer, until it becomes pliable. Thus prepared it is kept dry, in slices\r\nof convenient size, for use; and, although it is not so much esteemed in\r\nthis country as it was some years ago, many of the continental surgeons\r\nhave a very high opinion of its efficacy.\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nSECOND VOLUME.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n  Abele.
