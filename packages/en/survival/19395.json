If your station lies well beyond the glare of\r\ncities, which is often strong enough to conceal all but the brighter\r\nobjects, you will find the task a difficult one. Ranging through\r\nthe six magnitudes of the Greek astronomers, from the brilliant\r\nSirius to the faintest perceptible points of light, the stars are\r\nscattered in great profusion over the celestial vault. Their number\r\nseems limitless, yet actual count will show that the eye has been\r\ndeceived. In a survey of the entire heavens, from pole to pole,\r\nit would not be possible to detect more than from six to seven\r\nthousand stars with the naked eye. From a single viewpoint, even\r\nwith the keenest vision, only two or three thousand can be seen.\r\nSo many of these are at the limit of visibility that Ptolemy's\r\n\"Almagest,\" a catalogue of all the stars whose places were measured\r\nwith the simple instruments of the Greek astronomers, contains\r\nonly 1,022 stars.\r\n\r\nBack of Ptolemy, through the speculations of the Greek philosophers,\r\nthe mysteries of the Egyptian sun-god, and the observations of the\r\nancient Chaldeans, the rich and varied traditions of astronomy stretch\r\nfar away into a shadowy past. All peoples, in the first stirrings\r\nof their intellectual youth, drawn by the nightly splendor of the\r\nskies and the ceaseless motions of the planets, have set up some\r\nsystem of the heavens, in which the sense of wonder and the desire\r\nfor knowledge were no less concerned than the practical necessities\r\nof life. The measurement of time and the needs of navigation have\r\nalways stimulated astronomical research, but the intellectual demand\r\nhas been keen from the first. Hipparchus and the Greek astronomers\r\nof the Alexandrian school, shaking off the vagaries of magic and\r\ndivination, placed astronomy on a scientific basis, though the\r\nreaction of the Middle Ages caused even such a great astronomer\r\nas Tycho Brahe himself to revert for a time to the practice of\r\nastrology.\r\n\r\nEARLY INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nThe transparent sky of Egypt, rarely obscured by clouds, greatly\r\nfavored Ptolemy's observations. Here was prepared his great star\r\ncatalogue, based upon the earlier observations of Hipparchus, and\r\ndestined to remain alone in its field for more than twelve centuries,\r\nuntil Ulugh Bey, Prince of Samarcand, repeated the work of his\r\nGreek predecessor. Throughout this period the stars were looked\r\nupon mainly as points of reference for the observation of planetary\r\nmotions, and the instruments of observation underwent little change.\r\nThe astrolabe, which consists of a circle divided into degrees,\r\nwith a rotating diametral arm for sighting purposes, embodies their\r\nessential principle. In its simple form, the astrolabe was suspended\r\nin a vertical plane, and the stars were observed by bringing the\r\nsights on the movable diameter to bear upon them. Their altitude\r\nwas then read off on the circle. Ultimately, the circle of the\r\nastrolabe, mounted with one of its diameters parallel to the earth's\r\naxis, became the armillary sphere, the precursor of our modern\r\nequatorial telescope. Great stone quadrants fixed in the meridian\r\nwere also employed from very early times. Out of such furnishings,\r\nlittle modified by the lapse of centuries, was provided the elaborate\r\ninstrumental equipment of Uranibourg, the great observatory built\r\nby Tycho Brahe on the Danish island of Huen in 1576. In this \"City\r\nof the Heavens,\" still dependent solely upon the unaided eye as a\r\ncollector of starlight, Tycho made those invaluable observations\r\nthat enabled Kepler to deduce the true laws of planetary motion. But\r\nafter all these centuries the sidereal world embraced no objects,\r\nbarring an occasional comet or temporary star, that lay beyond\r\nthe vision of the earliest astronomers. The conceptions of the\r\nstellar universe, except those that ignored the solid ground of\r\nobservation, were limited by the small aperture of the human eye.\r\nBut the dawn of another age was at hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. The Great Nebula in Orion (Pease).\r\n\r\nPhotographed with the 100-inch telescope. This short-exposure photograph\r\nshows only the bright central part of the nebula. A longer exposure\r\nreveals a vast outlying region.]\r\n\r\nThe dominance of the sun as the central body of the solar system,\r\nrecognized by Aristarchus of Samos nearly three centuries before\r\nthe Christian era, but subsequently denied under the authority of\r\nPtolemy and the teachings of the Church, was reaffirmed by the\r\nPolish monk Copernicus in 1543. Kepler's laws of the motions of the\r\nplanets, showing them to revolve in ellipses instead of circles,\r\nremoved the last defect of the Copernican system, and left no room for\r\nits rejection. But both the world and the Church clung to tradition,\r\nand some visible demonstration was urgently needed. This was supplied\r\nby Galileo through his invention of the telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Model by Ellerman of summit of Mount Wilson,\r\nshowing the observatory buildings among the trees and bushes.\r\n\r\nThe 60-foot tower on the extreme left, which is at the edge of\r\na precipitous cañon 1,500 feet deep, is the vertical telescope\r\nof the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Above it are the\r\n\"Monastery\" and other buildings used as quarters by the astronomers\r\nof the Mount Wilson Observatory while at work on the mountain. (The\r\noffices, computing-rooms, laboratories, and shops are in Pasadena.)\r\nFollowing the ridge, we come successively to the dome of the 10-inch\r\nphotographic telescope, the power-house, laboratory, Snow horizontal\r\ntelescope, 60-foot-tower telescope, and 150-foot-tower telescope,\r\nthese last three used for the study of the sun. The dome of the\r\n60-inch reflecting telescope is just below the 150-foot tower,\r\nwhile that of the 100-inch telescope is farther to the right. The\r\naltitude of Mount Wilson is about 5,900 feet.]\r\n\r\nThe crystalline lens of the human eye, limited by the iris to a\r\nmaximum opening about one-quarter of an inch in diameter, was the\r\nonly collector of starlight available to the Greek and Arabian\r\nastronomers. Galileo's telescope, which in 1610 suddenly pushed\r\nout the boundaries of the known stellar universe and brought many\r\nthousands of stars into range, had a lens about 2-1/4 inches in\r\ndiameter. The area of this lens, proportional to the square of\r\nits diameter, was about eighty-one times that of the pupil of the\r\neye. This great increase in the amount of light collected should\r\nbring to view stars down to magnitude 10.5, of which nearly half\r\na million are known to exist.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that Galileo's telescope revolutionized\r\nhuman thought. Turned to the moon, it revealed mountains, plains,\r\nand valleys, while the sun, previously supposed immaculate in its\r\nperfection, was seen to be blemished with dark spots changing from\r\nday to day. Jupiter, shown to be accompanied by four encircling\r\nsatellites, afforded a picture in miniature of the solar system,\r\nand strongly supported the Copernican view of its organization,\r\nwhich was conclusively demonstrated by Galileo's discovery of the\r\nchanging phases of Venus and the variation of its apparent diameter\r\nduring its revolution about the sun. Galileo's proof of the Copernican\r\ntheory marked the downfall of mediævalism and established astronomy on\r\na firm foundation. But while his telescope multiplied a hundredfold\r\nthe number of visible stars, more than a century elapsed before\r\nthe true possibilities of sidereal astronomy were perceived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. The 100-inch Hooker telescope.]\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel was the first astronomer to make a serious\r\nattack upon the problem of the structure of the stellar universe.\r\nIn his first memoir on the \"Construction of the Heavens,\" read\r\nbefore the Royal Society in 1784, he wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Hitherto the sidereal heavens have, not inadequately for the purpose\r\ndesigned, been represented by the concave surface of a sphere in\r\nthe centre of which the eye of an observer might be supposed to be\r\nplaced.... In future we shall look upon those regions into which we\r\nmay now penetrate by means of such large telescopes, as a naturalist\r\nregards a rich extent of ground or chain of mountains containing\r\nstrata variously inclined and directed as well as consisting of\r\nvery different materials.\"\r\n\r\nOn turning his 18-inch reflecting telescope to a part of the Milky\r\nWay in Orion, he found its whitish appearance to be completely\r\nresolved into small stars, not separately seen with his former\r\ntelescopes. \"The glorious multitude of stars of all possible sizes\r\nthat presented themselves here to my view are truly astonishing; but\r\nas the dazzling brightness of glittering stars may easily mislead\r\nus so far as to estimate their number greater than it really is,\r\nI endeavored to ascertain this point by counting many fields, and\r\ncomputing from a mean of them, what a certain given portion of\r\nthe Milky Way might contain.\" By this means, applied not only to\r\nthe Milky Way but to all parts of the heavens, Herschel determined\r\nthe approximate number and distribution of all the stars within\r\nreach of his instrument.\r\n\r\nBy comparing many hundred gauges or counts of stars visible in\r\na field of about one-quarter of the area of the moon, Herschel\r\nfound that the average number of stars increased toward the great\r\ncircle which most nearly conforms with the course of the Milky Way.\r\nNinety degrees from this plane, at the pole of the Milky Way, only\r\nfour stars, on the average, were seen in the field of the telescope.\r\nIn approaching the Milky Way this number increased slowly at first,\r\nand then more and more rapidly, until it rose to an average of\r\n122 stars per field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Erecting the polar axis of the 100-inch\r\ntelescope.]\r\n\r\nThese observations were made in the northern hemisphere, and\r\nsubsequently Sir John Herschel, using his father's telescope at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, found an almost exactly similar increase\r\nof apparent star density for the southern hemisphere. According to\r\nhis estimates, the total number of stars in both hemispheres that\r\ncould be seen distinctly enough to be counted in this telescope\r\nwould probably be about five and one-half millions.\r\n\r\nThe Herschels concluded that \"the stars of our firmament, instead\r\nof being scattered in all directions indifferently through space,\r\nform a stratum of which the thickness is small, in comparison with\r\nits length and breadth; and in which the earth occupies a place\r\nsomewhere about the middle of its thickness, between the point\r\nwhere it subdivides into two principal laminæ inclined at a small\r\nangle to each other.\" This view does not differ essentially from our\r\nmodern conception of the form of the Galaxy; but as the Herschels\r\nwere unable to see stars fainter than the fifteenth magnitude,\r\nit is evident that their conclusions apply only to a restricted\r\nregion surrounding the solar system, in the midst of the enormously\r\nextended sidereal universe which modern instruments have brought\r\nwithin our range.\r\n\r\nMODERN METHODS\r\n\r\nThe remarkable progress of modern astronomy is mainly due to two\r\ngreat instrumental advances: the rise and development of the\r\nphotographic telescope, and the application of the spectroscope to\r\nthe study of celestial objects. These new and powerful instruments,\r\nsupplemented by many accessories which have completely revolutionized\r\nobservatory equipment, have not only revealed a vastly greater\r\nnumber of stars and nebulæ: they have also rendered feasible\r\nobservations of a type formerly regarded as impossible. The chemical\r\nanalysis of a faint star is now so easy that it can be accomplished\r\nin a very short time--as quickly, in fact, as an equally complex\r\nsubstance can be analyzed in the laboratory. The spectroscope also\r\nmeasures a star's velocity, the pressure at different levels in\r\nits atmosphere, its approximate temperature, and now, by a new\r\nand ingenious method, its distance from the earth. It determines\r\nthe velocity of rotation of the sun and of nebulæ, the existence\r\nand periods of orbital revolution of binary stars too close to\r\nbe separated by any telescope, the presence of magnetic fields\r\nin sunspots, and the fact that the entire sun, like the earth, is\r\na magnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Lowest section of tube of 100-inch telescope,\r\nready to leave Pasadena for Mount Wilson.]\r\n\r\nSuch new possibilities, with many others resulting from the application\r\nof physical methods of the most diverse character, have greatly\r\nenlarged the astronomer's outlook. He may now attack two great\r\nproblems: (1) The structure of the universe and the motions of\r\nits constituent bodies, and (2) the evolution of the stars: their\r\nnature, origin, growth, and decline. These two problems are intimately\r\nrelated and must be studied as one.[*]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: A third great problem open to the astronomer, the\r\nstudy of the constitution of matter, is described in Chapter III.]\r\n\r\nIf space permitted, it would be interesting to survey the progress\r\nalready accomplished by modern methods of astronomical research.\r\nHundreds of millions of stars have been photographed, and the boundaries\r\nof the stellar universe have been pushed far into space, but have not\r\nbeen attained. Globular star clusters, containing tens of thousands\r\nof stars, are on so great a scale (according to Shapley) that light,\r\ntravelling at the rate of 186,000 miles per second, may take 500\r\nyears to cross one of them, while the most distant of these objects\r\nmay be more than 200,000 light-years from the earth. The spiral\r\nnebulæ, more than a million in number, are vast whirling masses\r\nin process of development, but we are not yet certain whether they\r\nshould be regarded as \"island universes\" or as subordinate to the\r\nstellar system which includes our minute group of sun and planets,\r\nthe great star clouds of the Milky Way, and the distant globular\r\nstar clusters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Section of a steel girder for dome covering\r\nthe 100-inch telescope, on its way up Mount Wilson.]\r\n\r\nThese few particulars may give a slight conception of the scale\r\nof the known universe, but a word must be added regarding some\r\nof its most striking phenomena. The great majority of the stars\r\nwhose motions have been determined belong to one or the other of\r\ntwo great star streams, but the part played by these streams in the\r\nsidereal system as a whole is still obscure. The stars have been\r\ngrouped in classes, presumably in the order of their evolutional\r\ndevelopment, as they pass from the early state of gaseous masses, of\r\nlow density, through the successive stages resulting from loss of\r\nheat by radiation and increased density due to shrinkage. Strangely\r\nenough, their velocities in space show a corresponding change,\r\nincreasing as they grow older or perhaps depending upon their mass.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within these limits to do more than to give some\r\nindication of the scope of the new astronomy. Enough has been said,\r\nhowever, to assist in appreciating the increased opportunity for\r\ninvestigation, and the nature of the heavy demands made upon the\r\nmodern observatory. But before passing on to describe one of the\r\nlatest additions to the astronomer's instrumental equipment, a\r\nword should be added regarding the chief classes of telescopes.\r\n\r\nREFRACTORS AND REFLECTORS\r\n\r\nAstronomical telescopes are of two types: refractors and reflectors.\r\nA refracting telescope consists of an object-glass composed of\r\ntwo or more lenses, mounted at the upper end of a tube, which is\r\npointed at the celestial object. The light, after passing through\r\nthe lenses, is brought to a focus at the lower end of the tube, where\r\nthe image is examined visually with an eyepiece, or photographed\r\nupon a sensitive plate. The largest instruments of this type are\r\nthe 36-inch Lick telescope and the 40-inch refractor of the Yerkes\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Erecting the steel building and revolving\r\ndome that cover the Hooker telescope.]\r\n\r\nReflecting telescopes, which are particularly adapted for photographic\r\nwork, though also excellent for visual observations, are very\r\ndifferently constructed. No lens is used. The telescope tube is\r\nusually built in skeleton form, open at its upper end, and with\r\na large concave mirror supported at its base. This mirror serves\r\nin place of a lens. Its upper surface is paraboloidal in shape,\r\nas a spherical surface will not unite in a sharp focus the rays\r\ncoming from a distant object. The light passes through no glass--a\r\ngreat advantage, especially for photography, as the absorption\r\nin lenses cuts out much of the blue and violet light, to which\r\nphotographic plates are most sensitive. The reflection occurs on\r\nthe _upper_ surface of the mirror, which is covered with a coat of\r\npure silver, renewed several times a year and always kept highly\r\nburnished. Silvered glass is better than metals or other substances\r\nfor telescope mirrors, chiefly because of the perfection with which\r\nglass can be ground and polished, and the ease of renewing its\r\nsilvered surface when tarnished.\r\n\r\nThe great reflectors of Herschel and Lord Rosse, which were provided\r\nwith mirrors of speculum metal, were far inferior to much smaller\r\ntelescopes of the present day. With these instruments the star images\r\nwere watched as they were carried through the field of view by the\r\nearth's rotation, or kept roughly in place by moving the telescope\r\nwith ropes or chains. Photographic plates, which reveal invisible\r\nstars and nebulæ when exposed for hours in modern instruments, were\r\nnot then available. In any case they could not have been used,\r\nin the absence of the perfect mechanism required to keep the star\r\nimages accurately fixed in place upon the sensitive film.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Building and revolving dome, 100 feet in\r\ndiameter, covering the 100-inch Hooker telescope.\r\n\r\nPhotographed from the summit of the 150-foot-tower telescope.]\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to trace the long contest for supremacy\r\nbetween refracting and reflecting telescopes, each of which, at\r\ncertain stages in its development, appeared to be unrivalled. In\r\nmodern observatories both types are used, each for the purpose for\r\nwhich it is best adapted. For the photography of nebulæ and the\r\nstudy of the fainter stars, the reflector has special advantages,\r\nillustrated by the work of such instruments as the Crossley and Mills\r\nreflectors of the Lick Observatory; the great 72-inch reflector,\r\nrecently brought into effective service at the Dominion Observatory\r\nin Canada; and the 60-inch and 100-inch reflectors of the Mount\r\nWilson Observatory.\r\n\r\nThe unaided eye, with an available area of one-twentieth of a square\r\ninch, permits us to see stars of the sixth magnitude. Herschel's\r\n18-inch reflector, with an area 5,000 times as great, rendered\r\nvisible stars of the fifteenth magnitude. The 60-inch reflector,\r\nwith an area 57,600 times that of the eye, reveals stars of the\r\neighteenth magnitude, while to reach stars of about the twentieth\r\nmagnitude, photographic exposures of four or five hours suffice\r\nwith this instrument.\r\n\r\nEvery gain of a magnitude means a great gain in the number of stars\r\nrendered visible. Stars of the second magnitude are 3.4 times as\r\nnumerous as those of the first, those of the eighth magnitude are\r\nthree times as numerous as those of the seventh, while the sixteenth\r\nmagnitude stars are only 1.7 as numerous as those of the fifteenth\r\nmagnitude. This steadily decreasing ratio is probably due to an\r\nactual thinning out of the stars toward the boundaries of the stellar\r\nuniverse, as the most exhaustive tests have failed to give any\r\nevidence of absorption of light in its passage through space. But\r\nin spite of this decrease, the gain of a single additional magnitude\r\nmay mean the addition of many millions of stars to the total of those\r\nalready shown by the 60-inch reflector. Here is one of the chief\r\nsources of interest in the possibilities of a 100-inch reflecting\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n100-INCH TELESCOPE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. One-hundred-inch mirror, just silvered,\r\nrising out of the silvering-room in pier before attachment to lower\r\nend of telescope tube. (Seen above.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the late John D. Hooker, of Los Angeles, gave the Carnegie\r\nInstitution of Washington a sum sufficient to construct a telescope\r\nmirror 100 inches in diameter, and thus large enough to collect\r\n160,000 times the light received by the eye. (Fig. 10.) The casting\r\nand annealing of a suitable glass disk, 101 inches in diameter\r\nand 13 inches thick, weighing four and one-half tons, was a most\r\ndifficult operation, finally accomplished by a great French glass\r\ncompany at their factory in the Forest of St. Gobain. A special\r\noptical laboratory was erected at the Pasadena headquarters of\r\nthe Mount Wilson Observatory, and here the long task of grinding,\r\nfiguring, and testing the mirror was successfully carried out by\r\nthe observatory opticians. This operation, which is one of great\r\ndelicacy, required years for its completion. Meanwhile the building,\r\ndome, and mounting for the telescope were designed by members of\r\nthe observatory staff, and the working drawings were prepared. An\r\nopportune addition by Mr. Carnegie to the endowment of the Carnegie\r\nInstitution of Washington, of which the observatory is a branch,\r\npermitted the necessary appropriations to be made for the completion\r\nand erection of the telescope. Though delayed by the war, during\r\nwhich the mechanical and optical facilities of the observatory\r\nshops were utilized for military and naval purposes, the telescope\r\nis now in regular use on Mount Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is mounted on a massive pier of reinforced concrete,\r\n33 feet high and 52 feet in diameter at the top. A solid wall extends\r\nsouth from this pier a distance of 50 feet, on the west side of\r\nwhich a very powerful spectrograph, for photographing the spectra\r\nof the brightest stars, will be mounted. Within the pier are a\r\nphotographic dark room, a room for silvering the large mirror (which\r\ncan be lowered into the pier), and the clock-room, where stands\r\nthe powerful driving-clock, with which the telescope is caused\r\nto follow the apparent motion of the stars. (Fig. 11.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. The driving-clock and worm-gear that cause\r\nthe 100-inch Hooker telescope to follow the stars.]\r\n\r\nThe telescope mounting is of the English type, in which the telescope\r\ntube is supported by the declination trunnions between the arms of\r\nthe polar axis, built in the form of a rectangular yoke carried by\r\nbearings on massive pedestals to the north and south. These bearings\r\nmust be aligned exactly parallel to the axis of the earth, and must\r\nsupport the polar axis so freely that it can be rotated with perfect\r\nprecision by the driving-clock, which turns a worm-wheel 17 feet in\r\ndiameter, clamped to the lower end of the axis. As this motion\r\nmust be sufficiently uniform to counteract exactly the rotation\r\nof the earth on its axis, and thus to maintain the star images\r\naccurately in position in the field of view, the greatest care\r\nhad to be taken in the construction of the driving-clock and in\r\nthe spacing and cutting of the teeth in the large worm-wheel. Here,\r\nas in the case of all of the more refined parts of the instrument,\r\nthe work was done by skilled machinists in the observatory shops in\r\nPasadena or on Mount Wilson after the assembling of the telescope.\r\nThe massive sections of the instrument, some of which weigh as\r\nmuch as ten tons each, were constructed at Quincy, Mass., where\r\nmachinery sufficiently large to build battleships was available.\r\nThey were then shipped to California, and transported to the summit\r\nof Mount Wilson over a road built for this purpose by the construction\r\ndivision of the observatory, which also built the pier on which the\r\ntelescope stands, and erected the steel building and dome that\r\ncover it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Large irregular nebula and star cluster\r\nin Sagittarius (Duncan).\r\n\r\nPhotographed with the 60-inch telescope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Faint spiral nebula in the constellation\r\nof the Hunting Dogs (Pease).\r\n\r\nPhotographed with the 60-inch telescope.]\r\n\r\nThe parts of the telescope which are moved by the driving-clock\r\nweigh about 100 tons, and it was necessary to provide means of\r\nreducing the great friction on the bearings of the polar axis. To\r\naccomplish this, large hollow steel cylinders, floating in mercury\r\nheld in cast-iron tanks, were provided at the upper and lower ends\r\nof the polar axis. Almost the entire weight of the instrument is\r\nthus floated in mercury, and in this way the friction is so greatly\r\nreduced that the driving-clock moves the instrument with perfect\r\nease and smoothness.\r\n\r\nThe 100-inch mirror rests at the bottom of the telescope tube on\r\na special support system, so designed as to prevent any bending of\r\nthe glass under its own weight. Electric motors, forty in number, are\r\nprovided to move the telescope rapidly or slowly in right ascension\r\n(east or west) and in declination (north or south), for focussing\r\nthe mirrors, and for many other purposes. They are also used for\r\nrotating the dome, 100 feet in diameter, under which the telescope\r\nis mounted, and for opening the shutter, 20 feet wide, through\r\nwhich the observations are made.\r\n\r\nA telescope of this kind can be used in several different ways.\r\nThe 100-inch mirror has a focal length of about 42 feet, and in\r\none of the arrangements of the instrument, the photographic plate\r\nis mounted at the centre of the telescope tube near its upper end,\r\nwhere it receives directly the image formed by the large mirror. In\r\nanother arrangement, a silvered glass mirror, with plane surface,\r\nis supported near the upper end of the tube at an angle of 45°, so\r\nas to form the image at the side of the tube, where the photographic\r\nplate can be placed. In this case, the observer stands on a platform,\r\nwhich is moved up and down by electric motors in front of the opening\r\nin the dome through which the observations are made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Spiral nebula in Andromeda, seen edge on\r\n(Ritchey).\r\n\r\nPhotographed with the 60-inch telescope.]\r\n\r\nOther arrangements of the telescope, for which auxiliary convex\r\nmirrors carried near the upper end of the tube are required, permit\r\nthe image to be photographed at the side of the tube near its lower\r\nend, either with or without a spectrograph; or with a very powerful\r\nspectrograph mounted within a constant-temperature chamber south\r\nof the telescope pier. In this last case, the light of a star is\r\nso reflected by auxiliary mirrors that it passes down through a\r\nhole in the south end of the polar axis and brings the star to\r\na focus on the slit of the fixed spectrograph.\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC LIMITATIONS\r\n\r\nThe huge dimensions of such a powerful engine of research as the\r\nHooker telescope are not in themselves a source of satisfaction to\r\nthe astronomer, for they involve a decided increase in the labor\r\nof observation and entail very heavy expense, justifiable only in\r\ncase important results, beyond the reach of other instruments,\r\ncan be secured. The construction of a telescope of these dimensions\r\nwas necessarily an experiment, for it was by no means certain, after\r\nthe optical and mechanical difficulties had been overcome, that\r\neven the favorable atmosphere of California would be sufficiently\r\ntranquil to permit sharply defined celestial images to be obtained\r\nwith so large an aperture. It is therefore important to learn what\r\nthe telescope will actually accomplish under customary observing\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nFortunately we are able to measure the performance of the instrument\r\nwith certainty. Close beside it on Mount Wilson stands the 60-inch\r\nreflector, of similar type, erected in 1908. The two telescopes can\r\nthus be rigorously compared under identical atmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\nThe large mirror of the 100-inch telescope has an area about 2.8\r\ntimes that of the 60-inch, and therefore receives nearly three times\r\nas much light from a star. Under atmospheric conditions perfect\r\nenough to allow all of this light to be concentrated in a point,\r\nit should be capable of recording on a photographic plate, with a\r\ngiven exposure, stars about one magnitude fainter than the faintest\r\nstars within reach of the 60-inch. The increased focal length,\r\npermitting such objects as the moon to be photographed on a larger\r\nscale, should also reveal smaller details of structure and render\r\npossible higher accuracy of measurement. Finally, the greater\r\ntheoretical resolving power of the larger aperture, providing it\r\ncan be utilized, should permit the separation of the members of\r\nclose double stars beyond the range of the smaller instrument.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL TESTS\r\n\r\nThe many tests already made indicate that the advantages expected\r\nof the new telescope will be realized in practice. The increased\r\nlight-gathering power will mean the addition of many millions of\r\nstars to those already known. Spectroscopic observations now in\r\nregular progress have carried the range of these investigations\r\nfar beyond the possibilities of the 60-inch telescope. A great\r\nclass of red stars, for example, almost all the members of which\r\nwere inaccessible to the 60-inch, are now being made the subject\r\nof special study. And in other fields of research equal advantages\r\nhave been gained.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the scale of the images over those given by the\r\n60-inch telescope is illustrated by two photographs of the Ring\r\nNebula in Lyra, reproduced in Fig. 18. The Great Nebula in Orion,\r\nphotographed with the 100-inch telescope with a comparatively short\r\nexposure, sufficient to bring out the brighter regions, is reproduced\r\nin Fig. 2. It is interesting to compare this picture with the\r\nsmall-scale image of the same nebula shown in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Photograph of the moon made on September\r\n15, 1919, with the 100-inch Hooker telescope (Pease).\r\n\r\nThe ring-like formations are the so-called craters, most of them\r\nfar larger than anything similar on the earth. That in the lower\r\nleft corner with an isolated mountain in the centre is Albategnius,\r\nsixty-four miles in diameter. Peaks in the ring rise to a height\r\nof fifteen thousand feet above the central plain. Note the long\r\nsunset shadows cast by the mountains on the left. The level region\r\nbelow on the right is an extensive plain, the Mare Nubium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Photograph of the moon made on September\r\n15, 1919, with the 100-inch Hooker telescope (Pease).\r\n\r\nThe mountains above and to the left are the lunar Apennines; those\r\non the left just below the centre are the Alps. Both ranges include\r\npeaks from fifteen thousand to twenty thousand feet in height. In\r\nthe upper right corner is Copernicus, about fifty miles in diameter.\r\nThe largest of the conspicuous group of three just below the Apennines\r\nis Archimedes and at the lower end of the Alps is Plato. Note the\r\nlong sunset shadows cast by the isolated peaks on the left. The\r\ncentral portion of the picture is a vast plain, the Mare Imbrium.]\r\n\r\nThe sharpness of the images given by the new telescope may be\r\nillustrated by some recent photographs of the moon, obtained with\r\nan equivalent focal length of 134 feet. In Fig. 15 is shown a rugged\r\nregion of the moon, containing many ring-like mountains or craters.\r\nFig. 16 shows the great arc of the lunar Apennines (above) and the\r\nAlps (below), to the left of the broad plain of the Mare Imbrium.\r\nThe starlike points along the moon's terminator, which separates\r\nthe dark area from the region upon which the sun (on the right)\r\nshines, are the mountain peaks, about to disappear at sunset. The\r\nlong shadows cast by the mountains just within the illuminated\r\narea are plainly seen. Some of the peaks of the lunar Apennines\r\nattain a height of 20,000 feet.\r\n\r\nIn less powerful telescopes the stars at the centre of the great\r\nglobular clusters are so closely crowded together that they cannot\r\nbe studied separately with the spectrograph. Moreover, most of\r\nthem are much too faint for examination with this instrument. At\r\nthe 134-foot focus the 100-inch telescope gives a large-scale image\r\nof such clusters, and permits the spectra of stars as faint as\r\nthe fifteenth magnitude to be separately photographed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Hubble's Variable Nebula. One of the few\r\nnebulæ known to vary in brightness and form.\r\n\r\nPhotographed with the 100-inch telescope (Hubble).]\r\n\r\nCLOSE DOUBLE STARS\r\n\r\nA remarkable use of the 100-inch telescope, which permits its full\r\ntheoretical resolving power to be not merely attained but to be\r\ndoubled, has been made possible by the first application of Michelson's\r\ninterference method to the measurement of very close double stars.\r\nWhen employing this, the 100-inch mirror is completely covered,\r\nexcept for two slits. Beams of light from a star, entering by the\r\nslits, unite at the focus of the telescope, where the image is\r\nexamined by an eyepiece magnifying about five thousand diameters.\r\nAcross the enlarged star image a series of fine, sharp fringes is\r\nseen, even when the atmospheric conditions are poor. If the star is\r\nsingle the fringes remain visible, whatever the distance between the\r\nslits. But in the case of a star like Capella, previously inferred\r\nto be double from the periodic displacement of the lines in its\r\nspectrum, but with components too close together to be distinguished\r\nseparately, the fringes behave differently. As the slits are moved\r\napart a point is reached where the fringes completely disappear,\r\nonly to reappear as the separation is continued. This effect is\r\nobtained when the slits are at right angles to the line joining\r\nthe two stars of the pair, found by this method to be 0.0418 of a\r\nsecond of arc apart (on December 30, 1919). Subsequent measures,\r\nof far greater precision than those obtainable by other methods in\r\nthe case of easily separated double stars, show the rapid orbital\r\nmotion of the components of the system. This device will be applied\r\nto other close binaries, hitherto beyond the reach of measurement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Ring Nebula in Lyra, photographed with the\r\n60-inch (Ritchey) and 100-inch (Duncan) telescopes.\r\n\r\nShowing the increased scale of the images given by the larger\r\ninstrument.]\r\n\r\nWithout entering into further details of the tests, it is evident\r\nthat the new telescope will afford boundless possibilities for\r\nthe study of the stellar universe.[*] The structure and extent of\r\nthe galactic system, and the motions of the stars comprising it;\r\nthe distribution, distances, and dimensions of the spiral nebulæ,\r\ntheir motions, rotation, and mode of development; the origin of\r\nthe stars and the successive stages in their life history: these\r\nare some of the great questions which the new telescope must help\r\nto answer. In such an embarrassment of riches the chief difficulty\r\nis to withstand the temptation toward scattering of effort, and to\r\nform an observing programme directed toward the solution of crucial\r\nproblems rather than the accumulation of vast stores of miscellaneous\r\ndata. This programme will be supplemented by an extensive study\r\nof the sun, the only star near enough the earth to be examined\r\nin detail, and by a series of laboratory investigations involving\r\nthe experimental imitation of solar and stellar conditions, thus\r\naiding in the interpretation of celestial phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: It is not adapted for work on the sun, as the mirrors\r\nwould be distorted by its heat. Three other telescopes, especially\r\ndesigned for solar observations, are in use on Mount Wilson.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGIANT STARS\r\n\r\nOur ancestral sun, as pictured by Laplace, originally extended\r\nin a state of luminous vapor beyond the boundaries of the solar\r\nsystem. Rotating upon its axis, it slowly contracted through loss\r\nof heat by radiation, leaving behind it portions of its mass, which\r\ncondensed to form the planets. Still gaseous, though now denser than\r\nwater, it continues to pour out the heat on which our existence\r\ndepends, as it shrinks imperceptibly toward its ultimate condition\r\nof a cold and darkened globe.\r\n\r\nLaplace's hypothesis has been subjected in recent years to much\r\ncriticism, and there is good reason to doubt whether his description\r\nof the mode of evolution of our solar system is correct in every\r\nparticular. All critics agree, however, that the sun was once enormously\r\nlarger than it now is, and that the planets originally formed part\r\nof its distended mass.\r\n\r\nEven in its present diminished state, the sun is huge beyond easy\r\nconception. Our own earth, though so minute a fragment of the primeval\r\nsun, is nevertheless so large that some parts of its surface have\r\nnot yet been explored. Seen beside the sun, by an observer on one\r\nof the planets, the earth would appear as an insignificant speck,\r\nwhich could be swallowed with ease by the whirling vortex of a\r\nsun-spot. If the sun were hollow, with the earth at its centre,\r\nthe moon, though 240,000 miles from us, would have room and to\r\nspare in which to describe its orbit, for the sun is 865,000 miles\r\nin diameter, so that its volume is more than a million times that\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Gaseous prominence at the sun's limb, 140,000\r\nmiles high (Ellerman).\r\n\r\nPhotographed with the spectroheliograph, using the light emitted\r\nby glowing calcium vapor. The comparative size of the earth is\r\nindicated by the white circle.]\r\n\r\nBut what of the stars, proved by the spectroscope to be self-luminous,\r\nintensely hot, and formed of the same chemical elements that constitute\r\nthe sun and the earth? Are they comparable in size with the sun? Do\r\nthey occur in all stages of development, from infancy to old age?\r\nAnd if such stages can be detected, do they afford indications\r\nof the gradual diminution in volume which Laplace imagined the\r\nsun to experience?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. The sun, 865,000 miles in diameter, from\r\na direct photograph showing many sun-spots (Whitney)\r\n\r\nThe small black disk in the centre represents the comparative size\r\nof the earth, while the circle surrounding it corresponds in diameter\r\nto the orbit of the moon.]\r\n\r\nSTAR IMAGES\r\n\r\nPrior to the application of the powerful new engine of research\r\ndescribed in this article we have had no means of measuring the\r\ndiameters of the stars. We have measured their distances and their\r\nmotions, determined their chemical composition, and obtained undeniable\r\nevidence of progressive development, but even in the most powerful\r\ntelescopes their images are so minute that they appear as points\r\nrather than as disks. In fact, the larger the telescope and the\r\nmore perfect the atmospheric conditions at the observer's command,\r\nthe smaller do these images appear. On the photographic plate, it is\r\ntrue, the stars are recorded as measurable disks, but these are due\r\nto the spreading of the light from their bright point-like images,\r\nand their diameters increase as the exposure time is prolonged.\r\nFrom the images of the brighter stars rays of light project in\r\nstraight lines, but these also are instrumental phenomena, due\r\nto diffraction of light by the steel bars that support the small\r\nmirror in the tube of reflecting telescopes. In a word, the stars\r\nare so remote that the largest and most perfect telescopes show\r\nthem only as extremely minute needle-points of light, without any\r\ntrace of their true disks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Great sun-spot group, August 8, 1917 (Whitney).\r\n\r\nThe disk in the corner represents the comparative size of the earth.]\r\n\r\nHow, then, may we hope to measure their diameters? By using, as\r\nthe man of science must so often do, indirect means when the direct\r\nattack fails. Most of the remarkable progress of astronomy during\r\nthe last quarter-century has resulted from the application of new and\r\ningenious devices borrowed from the physicist. These have multiplied\r\nto such a degree that some of our observatories are literally physical\r\nlaboratories, in which the sun and stars are examined by powerful\r\nspectroscopes and other optical instruments that have recently advanced\r\nour knowledge of physics by leaps and bounds. In the present case\r\nwe are indebted for our star-measuring device to the distinguished\r\nphysicist Professor Albert A. Michelson, who has contributed a long\r\narray of novel apparatus and methods to physics and astronomy.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERFEROMETER\r\n\r\nThe instrument in question, known as the interferometer, had previously\r\nyielded a remarkable series of results when applied in its various\r\nforms to the solution of fundamental problems. To mention only a\r\nfew of those that have helped to establish Michelson's fame, we may\r\nrecall that our exact knowledge of the length of the international\r\nmetre at Sevres, the world's standard of measurement, was obtained\r\nby him with an interferometer in terms of the invariable length of\r\nlight-waves. A different form of interferometer has more recently\r\nenabled him to measure the minute tides within the solid body of the\r\nearth--not the great tides of the ocean, but the slight deformations\r\nof the earth's body, which is as rigid as steel, that are caused by\r\nthe varying attractions of the sun and moon. Finally, to mention\r\nonly one more case, it was the Michelson-Morley experiment, made\r\nyears ago with still another form of interferometer, that yielded\r\nthe basic idea from which the theory of relativity was developed\r\nby Lorentz and Einstein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Photograph of the hydrogen atmosphere of\r\nthe sun (Ellerman).\r\n\r\nMade with the spectroheliograph, showing the immense vortices,\r\nor whirling storms like tornadoes, that centre in sun-spots. The\r\ncomparative size of the earth is shown by the white circle traced\r\non the largest sun-spot.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the method of measuring star diameters is a very\r\ncurious one, showing how the most promising opportunities for scientific\r\nprogress may lie unused for decades. The fundamental principle\r\nof the device was first suggested by the great French physicist\r\nFizeau in 1868. In 1874 the theory was developed by the French\r\nastronomer Stéphan, who observed interference fringes given by a\r\nlarge number of stars, and rightly concluded that their angular\r\ndiameters must be much smaller than 0.158 of a second of arc, the\r\nsmallest measurable with his instrument. In 1890 Michelson, unaware\r\nof the earlier work, published in the _Philosophical Magazine_ a\r\ncomplete description of an interferometer capable of determining\r\nwith surprising accuracy the distance between the components of\r\ndouble stars so close together that no telescope can separate them.\r\nHe also showed how the same principle could be applied to the\r\nmeasurement of star diameters if a sufficiently large interferometer\r\ncould be built for this purpose, and developed the theory much\r\nmore completely than Stéphan had done. A year later he measured\r\nthe diameters of Jupiter's satellites by this means at the Lick\r\nObservatory. But nearly thirty years elapsed before the next step\r\nwas taken. Two causes have doubtless contributed to this delay. Both\r\ntheory and experiment have demonstrated the extreme sensitiveness\r\nof the \"interference fringes,\" on the observation of which the\r\nmethod depends, and it was generally supposed by astronomers that\r\ndisturbances in the earth's atmosphere would prevent them from\r\nbeing clearly seen with large telescopes. Furthermore, a very large\r\ninterferometer, too large to be carried by any existing telescope,\r\nwas required for the star-diameter work, though close double stars\r\ncould have been easily studied by this device with several of the\r\nlarge telescopes of the early nineties. But whatever the reasons,\r\na powerful method of research lay unused.\r\n\r\nThe approaching completion of the 100-inch telescope of the Mount\r\nWilson Observatory led me to suggest to Professor Michelson, before\r\nthe United States entered the war, that the method be thoroughly\r\ntested under the favorable atmospheric conditions of Southern\r\nCalifornia. He was at that time at work on a special form of\r\ninterferometer, designed to determine whether atmospheric disturbances\r\ncould be disregarded in planning large-scale experiments. But the\r\nwar intervened, and all of our efforts were concentrated for two\r\nyears on the solution of war problems.[*] In 1919, as soon as the\r\n100-inch telescope had been completed and tested, the work was\r\nresumed on Mount Wilson.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: Professor Michelson's most important contribution during\r\nthe war period was a new and very efficient form of range-finder,\r\nadopted for use by the U. S. Navy.]\r\n\r\nA LABORATORY EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nThe principle of the method can be most readily seen by the aid\r\nof an experiment which any one can easily perform for himself with\r\nsimple apparatus. Make a narrow slit, a few thousandths of an inch\r\nin width, in a sheet of black paper, and support it vertically\r\nbefore a brilliant source of light. Observe this from a distance of\r\n40 or 50 feet with a small telescope magnifying about 30 diameters.\r\nThe object-glass of the telescope should be covered with an opaque\r\ncap, pierced by two circular holes about one-eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter and half an inch apart. The holes should be on opposite\r\nsides of the centre of the object-glass and equidistant from it,\r\nand the line joining the holes should be horizontal. When this\r\ncap is removed the slit appears as a narrow vertical band with\r\nmuch fainter bands on both sides of it. With the cap in place, the\r\ncentral bright band appears to be ruled with narrow vertical lines\r\nor fringes produced by the \"interference\"[*] of the two pencils of\r\nlight coming through different parts of the object-glass from the\r\ndistant slit. Cover one of the holes, and the fringes instantly\r\ndisappear. Their production requires the joint effect of the two\r\nlight-pencils.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: For an explanation of the phenomena of interference,\r\nsee any encyclopæedia or book on physics.]\r\n\r\nNow suppose the two holes over the object-glass to be in movable\r\nplates, so that their distance apart can be varied. As they are\r\ngradually separated the narrow vertical fringes become less and\r\nless distinct, and finally vanish completely. Measure the distance\r\nbetween the holes and divide this by the wavelength of light, which\r\nwe may call 1/50000 of an inch. The result is the angular width\r\nof the distant slit. Knowing the distance of the slit, we can at\r\nonce calculate its linear width. If for the slit we substitute a\r\nminute circular hole, the method of measurement remains the same,\r\nbut the angular diameter as calculated above must be multiplied\r\nby 1.22.[*]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: More complete details may be found in Michelson's Lowell\r\nLectures on \"Light-Waves and Their Uses,\" University of Chicago\r\nPress, 1907.]\r\n\r\nTo measure the diameter of a star we proceed in a similar way,\r\nbut, as the angle it subtends is so small, we must use a very large\r\ntelescope, for the smaller the angle the farther apart must be the\r\ntwo holes over the object-glass (or the mirror, in case a reflecting\r\ntelescope is employed). In fact, when the holes are moved apart to\r\nthe full aperture of the 100-inch Hooker telescope, the interference\r\nfringes are still visible even with the star Betelgeuse, though its\r\nangular diameter is perhaps as great as that of any other star.\r\nThus, we must build an attachment for the telescope, so arranged\r\nas to permit us to move the openings still farther apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Diagram showing outline of the 100-inch\r\nHooker telescope, and path of the two pencils of light from a star\r\nwhen under observation with the 20-foot Michelson interferometer.\r\n\r\nA photograph of the interferometer is shown in Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\nTHE 20-FOOT INSTRUMENT\r\n\r\nThe 20-foot interferometer designed by Messrs. Michelson and Pease,\r\nand constructed in the Mount Wilson Observatory instrument-shop,\r\nis shown in the diagram (Fig. 23) and in a photograph of the upper\r\nend of the skeleton tube of the telescope (Fig. 24). The light from\r\nthe star is received by two flat mirrors (Ml, M4) which project\r\nbeyond the tube and can be moved apart along the supporting arm.\r\nThese take the place of the two holes over the object-glass in\r\nour experiment. From these mirrors the light is reflected to a\r\nsecond pair of flat mirrors (M2, M3), which send it toward the\r\n100-inch concave mirror (M5) at the bottom of the telescope tube.\r\nAfter this the course of the light is exactly as it would be if\r\nthe mirrors M2, M3 were replaced by two holes over the 100-inch\r\nmirror. It is reflected to the convex mirror (M6), then back in\r\na less rapidly convergent beam toward the large mirror. Before\r\nreaching it the light is caught by the plane mirror (M7) and reflected\r\nthrough an opening at the side of the telescope tube to the eye-piece\r\nE. Here the fringes are observed with a magnification ranging from\r\n1,500 to 3,000 diameters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Twenty-foot Michelson interferometer for\r\nmeasuring star diameters, attached to upper end of the skeleton\r\ntube of the 100-inch Hooker telescope.\r\n\r\nThe path of the two pencils of light from the star is shown in\r\nFig. 23. For a photograph of the entire telescope, see Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nIn the practical application of this method to the measurement of\r\nstar diameters, the chief problem was whether the atmosphere would\r\nbe quiet enough to permit sharp interference fringes to be produced\r\nwith light-pencils more than 100 inches apart. After successful\r\npreliminary tests with the 40-inch refracting telescope of the\r\nYerkes Observatory, Professor Michelson made the first attempt\r\nto see the fringes with the 60-inch and 100-inch reflectors on\r\nMount Wilson in September, 1919. He was surprised and delighted to\r\nfind that the fringes were perfectly sharp and distinct with the\r\nfull aperture of both these instruments. Doctor Anderson, of the\r\nobservatory staff, then devised a special form of interferometer\r\nfor the measurement of close double stars, and applied it with\r\nthe 100-inch telescope to the measurement of the orbital motion\r\nof the close components of Capella, with results of extraordinary\r\naccuracy, far beyond anything attainable by previous methods. The\r\nsuccess of this work strongly encouraged the more ambitious project\r\nof measuring the diameter of a star, and the 20-foot interferometer\r\nwas built for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe difficult and delicate problem of adjusting the mirrors of\r\nthis instrument with the necessary extreme accuracy was solved by\r\nProfessor Michelson during his visit to Mount Wilson in the summer\r\nof 1920, and with the assistance of Mr. Pease, of the observatory\r\nstaff, interference fringes were observed in the case of certain\r\nstars when the mirrors were as much as 18 feet apart. All was thus\r\nin readiness for a decisive test as soon as a suitable star presented\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT BETELGEUSE\r\n\r\nRussell, Shapley, and Eddington had pointed out Betelgeuse (Arabic\r\nfor \"the giant's shoulder\"), the bright red star in the constellation\r\nof Orion (Fig. 25), as the most favorable of all stars for measurement,\r\nand the last-named had given its angular diameter as 0.051 of a\r\nsecond of arc. This deduction from theory appeared in his recent\r\npresidential address before the British Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science, in which Professor Eddington remarked: \"Probably the\r\ngreatest need of stellar astronomy at the present day, in order\r\nto make sure that our theoretical deductions are starting on the\r\nright lines, is some means of measuring the apparent angular diameter\r\nof stars.\" He then referred to the work already in progress on\r\nMount Wilson, but anticipated \"that atmospheric disturbance will\r\nultimately set the limit to what can be accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. The giant Betelgeuse (within the circle),\r\nfamiliar as the conspicuous red star in the right shoulder of Orion\r\n(Hubble).\r\n\r\nMeasures with the interferometer show its angular diameter to be\r\n0.047 of a second of arc, corresponding to a linear diameter of\r\n215,000,000 miles, if the best available determination of its distance\r\ncan be relied upon. This determination shows Betelgeuse to be 160\r\nlight-years from the earth. Light travels at the rate of 186,000\r\nmiles per second, and yet spends 160 years on its journey to us\r\nfrom this star.]\r\n\r\nOn December 13, 1920, Mr. Pease successfully measured the diameter\r\nof Betelgeuse with the 20-foot interferometer. As the outer mirrors\r\nwere separated the interference fringes gradually became less distinct,\r\nas theory requires, and as Doctor Merrill had previously seen when\r\nobserving Betelgeuse with the interferometer used for Capella. At\r\na separation of 10 feet the fringes disappeared completely, giving\r\nthe data required for calculating the diameter of the star. To\r\ntest the perfection of the adjustment, the telescope was turned to\r\nother stars, of smaller angular diameter, which showed the fringes\r\nwith perfect clearness. Turning back to Betelgeuse, they were seen\r\nbeyond doubt to be absent. Assuming the mean wave-length of the\r\nlight of this star to be 5750/10000000 of a millimetre, its angular\r\ndiameter comes out 0.047 of a second of arc, thus falling between\r\nthe values--0.051 and 0.031 of a second--predicted by Eddington and\r\nRussell from slightly different assumptions. Subsequent corrections\r\nand repeated measurement will change Mr. Pease's result somewhat,\r\nbut it is almost certainly within 10 or 15 per cent of the truth.\r\nWe may therefore conclude that the angular diameter of Betelgeuse\r\nis very nearly the same as that of a ball one inch in diameter,\r\nseen at a distance of seventy miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Arcturus (within the white circle), known\r\nto the Arabs as the \"Lance Bearer,\" and to the Chinese as the \"Great\r\nHorn\" or the \"Palace of the Emperors\" (Hubble).\r\n\r\nIts angular diameter, measured at Mount Wilson by Pease with the\r\n20-foot Michelson interferometer on April 15, 1921, is 0.022 of a\r\nsecond, in close agreement with Russell's predicted value of 0.019\r\nof a second. The mean parallax of Arcturus, based upon several\r\ndeterminations, is 0.095 of a second, corresponding to a distance of\r\n34 light-years. The linear diameter, computed from Pease's measure\r\nand this value of the distance is about 21 million miles.]\r\n\r\nBut this represents only the angle subtended by the star's disk.\r\nTo learn its linear diameter, we must know its distance. Four\r\ndeterminations of the parallax, which determines the distance,\r\nhave been made. Elkin, with the Yale heliometer, obtained 0.032\r\nof a second of arc. Schlesinger, from photographs taken with the\r\n30-inch Allegheny refractor, derived 0.016. Adams, by his spectroscopic\r\nmethod applied with the 60-inch Mount Wilson reflector, obtained\r\n0.012. Lee's recent value, secured photographically with the 40-inch\r\nYerkes refractor, is 0.022. The heliometer parallax is doubtless\r\nless reliable than the photographic ones, and Doctor Adams states\r\nthat the spectral type and luminosity of Betelgeuse make his value\r\nless certain than in the case of most other stars. If we take a\r\n(weighted) mean value of 0.020 of a second, we shall probably not\r\nbe far from the truth. This parallax represents the angle subtended\r\nby the radius of the earth's orbit (93,000,000 miles) at the distance\r\nof Betelgeuse. By comparing it with 0.047, the angular diameter of\r\nthe star, we see that the linear diameter is about two and one-third\r\ntimes as great as the distance from the earth to the sun, or\r\napproximately 215,000,000 miles. Thus, if this measure of its distance\r\nis not considerably in error, Betelgeuse would nearly fill the\r\norbit of Mars. All methods of determining the distances of the\r\nstars are subject to uncertainty, however, and subsequent measures\r\nmay reduce this figure very appreciably. But there can be no doubt\r\nthat the diameter of Betelgeuse exceeds 100,000,000 miles, and\r\nit is probably much greater.\r\n\r\nThe extremely small angle subtended by this enormous disk is explained\r\nby the great distance of the star, which is about 160 light-years.\r\nThat is to say, light travelling at the rate of 186,000 miles per\r\nsecond spends 160 years in crossing the space that lies between\r\nus and Betelgeuse, whose tremendous proportions therefore seem\r\nso minute even in the most powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nSTELLAR EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nThis actual measure of the diameter of Betelgeuse supplies a new\r\nand striking test of Russell's and Hertzsprung's theory of dwarf\r\nand giant stars. Just before the war Russell showed that our old\r\nmethods of classifying the stars according to their spectra must\r\nbe radically changed. Stars in an early stage of their life history\r\nmay be regarded as diffuse gaseous masses, enormously larger than\r\nour sun, and at a much lower temperature. Their density must be\r\nvery low, and their state that of a perfect gas. These are the\r\n\"giants.\" In the slow process of time they contract through constant\r\nloss of heat by radiation. But, despite this loss, the heat produced\r\nby contraction and from other sources (see p. 82) causes their\r\ntemperature to rise, while their color changes from red to bluish\r\nwhite. The process of shrinkage and rise of temperature goes on so\r\nlong as they remain in the state of a perfect gas. But as soon as\r\ncontraction has increased the density of the gas beyond a certain\r\npoint the cycle reverses and the temperature begins to fall. The\r\nbluish-white light of the star turns yellowish, and we enter the\r\ndwarf stage, of which our own sun is a representative. The density\r\nincreases, surpassing that of water in the case of the sun, and\r\ngoing far beyond this point in later stages. In the lapse of millions\r\nof years a reddish hue appears, finally turning to deep red. The\r\nfalling temperature permits the chemical elements, existing in a\r\ngaseous state in the outer atmosphere of the star, to unite into\r\ncompounds, which are rendered conspicuous by their characteristic\r\nbands in the spectrum. Finally comes extinction of light, as the\r\nstar approaches its ultimate state of a cold and solid globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. The giant star Antares (within the white\r\ncircle), notable for its red color in the constellation Scorpio,\r\nand named by the Greeks \"A Rival of Mars\" (Hubble).\r\n\r\nThe distance of Antares, though not very accurately known, is probably\r\nnot far from 350 light-years. Its angular diameter of 0.040 of a\r\nsecond would thus correspond to a linear diameter of about 400\r\nmillion miles.]\r\n\r\nWe may thus form a new picture of the two branches of the temperature\r\ncurve, long since suggested by Lockyer, on very different grounds, as\r\nthe outline of stellar life. On the ascending side are the giants,\r\nof vast dimensions and more diffuse than the air we breathe. There\r\nare good reasons for believing that the mass of Betelgeuse cannot\r\nbe more than ten times that of the sun, while its volume is at\r\nleast a million times as great and may exceed eight million times\r\nthe sun's volume. Therefore, its average density must be like that\r\nof an attenuated gas in an electric vacuum tube. Three-quarters\r\nof the naked-eye stars are in the giant stage, which comprises\r\nsuch familiar objects as Betelgeuse, Antares, and Aldebaran, but\r\nmost of them are much denser than these greatly inflated bodies.\r\nThe pinnacle is reached in the intensely hot white stars of the\r\nhelium class, in whose spectra the lines of this gas are very\r\nconspicuous. The density of these stars is perhaps one-tenth that\r\nof the sun. Sirius, also very hot, is nearly twice as dense. Then\r\ncomes the cooling stage, characterized, as already remarked, by\r\nincreasing density, and also by increasing chemical complexity\r\nresulting from falling temperature. This life cycle is probably\r\nnot followed by all stars, but it may hold true for millions of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe existence of giant and dwarf stars has been fully proved by\r\nthe remarkable work of Adams and his associates on Mount Wilson,\r\nwhere his method of determining a star's distance and intrinsic\r\nluminosity by spectroscopic observations has already been applied\r\nto 2,000 stars. Discussion of the results leads at once to the\r\nrecognition of the two great classes of giants and dwarfs. Now\r\ncomes the work of Michelson and Pease to cap the climax, giving us\r\nthe actual diameter of a typical giant star, in close agreement with\r\npredictions based upon theory. From this diameter we may conclude that\r\nthe density of Betelgeuse is extremely low, in harmony with Russell's\r\ntheory, which is further supported by spectroscopic analysis of\r\nthe star's light, revealing evidence of the comparatively low\r\ntemperature called for by the theory at this early stage of stellar\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nTWO OTHER GIANTS\r\n\r\nThe diameter of Arcturus was successfully measured by Mr. Pease\r\nat Mount Wilson on April 15. As the mirrors of the interferometer\r\nwere moved apart, the fringes gradually decreased in visibility\r\nuntil they finally disappeared at a mirror separation of 19.6 feet.\r\nAdopting a mean wave-length of 5600/10000000 of a millimetre for\r\nthe light of Arcturus, this gives a value of 0.022 of a second of\r\narc for the angular diameter of the star. If we use a mean value\r\nof 0.095 of a second for the parallax, the corresponding linear\r\ndiameter comes out 21,000,000 miles. The angular diameter, as in\r\nthe case of Betelgeuse, is in remarkably close agreement with the\r\ndiameter predicted from theory. Antares, the third star measured\r\nby Mr. Pease, is the largest of all. If it is actually a member of\r\nthe Scorpius-Centaurus group, as we have strong reason to believe,\r\nit is fully 350 light-years from the earth, and its diameter is\r\nabout 400,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Diameters of the Sun, Arcturus, Betelgeuse,\r\nand Antares compared with the orbit of Mars.\r\n\r\nSun, diameter, 865,000 miles.\r\n\r\nArcturus, diameter, 21,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nBetelgeuse, diameter, 215,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nAntares, diameter, 400,000,000 miles.]\r\n\r\nIt now remains to make further measures of Betelgeuse, especially\r\nbecause its marked changes in brightness suggest possible variations\r\nin diameter. We must also apply the interferometer method to stars\r\nof the various spectral types, in order to afford a sure basis for\r\nfuture studies of stellar evolution. Unfortunately, only a few\r\ngiant stars are certain to fall within the range of our present\r\ninstrument. An interferometer of 70-feet aperture would be needed\r\nto measure Sirius accurately, and one of twice this size to deal\r\nwith less brilliant white stars. A 100-foot instrument, if feasible\r\nto build, would permit objects representing most of the chief stages\r\nof stellar development to be measured, thus contributing in the\r\nhighest degree to the progress of our knowledge of the life history\r\nof the stars. Fortunately, though the mechanical difficulties are\r\ngreat, the optical problem is insignificant, and the cost of the\r\nentire apparatus, though necessarily high, would be only a small\r\nfraction of that of a telescope of corresponding aperture, if such\r\ncould be built. A 100-foot interferometer might be designed in\r\nmany different forms, and one of these may ultimately be found\r\nto be within the range of possibility. Meanwhile the 20-foot\r\ninterferometer has been improved so materially that it now promises\r\nto yield approximate measures of stars at first supposed to be\r\nbeyond its capacity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Aldebaran, the \"leader\" (of the Pleiades),\r\nwas also known to the Arabs as \"The Eye of the Bull,\" \"The Heart\r\nof the Bull,\" and \"The Great Camel\" (Hubble).\r\n\r\nLike Betelgeuse and Antares, it is notable for its red color, which\r\naccounts for the fact that its image on this photograph is hardly\r\nmore conspicuous than the images of stars which are actually much\r\nfainter but contain a larger proportion of blue light, to which\r\nthe photographic plates here employed are more sensitive than to\r\nred or yellow. Aldebaran is about 50 light-years from the earth.\r\nInterferometer measures, now in progress on Mount Wilson, indicate\r\nthat its angular diameter is about 0.020 of a second.]\r\n\r\nWhile the theory of dwarf and giant stars and the measurements just\r\ndescribed afford no direct evidence bearing on Laplace's explanation\r\nof the formation of planets, they show that stars exist which are\r\ncomparable in diameter with our solar system, and suggest that the\r\nsun must have shrunk from vast dimensions. The mode of formation\r\nof systems like our own, and of other systems numerously illustrated\r\nin the heavens, is one of the most fascinating problems of astronomy.\r\nMuch light has been thrown on it by recent investigations, rendered\r\npossible by the development of new and powerful instruments and by\r\nadvances in physics of the most fundamental character. All the\r\nevidence confirms the existence of dwarf and giant stars, but much\r\nwork must be done before the entire course of stellar evolution\r\ncan be explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCOSMIC CRUCIBLES\r\n\r\n\"Shelter during Raids,\" marking the entrance to underground passages,\r\nwas a sign of common occurrence and sinister suggestion throughout\r\nLondon during the war. With characteristic ingenuity and craftiness,\r\nostensibly for purposes of peace but with bomb-carrying capacity\r\nas a prime specification, the Zeppelin had been developed by the\r\nGermans to a point where it seriously threatened both London and\r\nParis. Searchlights, range-finders, and anti-aircraft guns, surpassed\r\nby the daring ventures of British and French airmen, would have\r\nserved but little against the night invader except for its one\r\nfatal defect--the inflammable nature of the hydrogen gas that kept\r\nit aloft. A single explosive bullet served to transform a Zeppelin\r\ninto a heap of scorched and twisted metal. This characteristic\r\nof hydrogen caused the failure of the Zeppelin raids.\r\n\r\nHad the war lasted a few months longer, however, the work of American\r\nscientists would have made our counter-attack in the air a formidable\r\none. At the signing of the armistice hundreds of cylinders of compressed\r\nhelium lay at the docks ready for shipment abroad. Extracted from\r\nthe natural gas of Texas wells by new and ingenious processes,\r\nthis substitute for hydrogen, almost as light and absolutely\r\nuninflammable, produced in quantities of millions of cubic feet,\r\nwould have made the dirigibles of the Allies masters of the air. The\r\nspecial properties of this remarkable gas, previously obtainable only\r\nin minute quantities, would have sufficed to reverse the situation.\r\n\r\nSOLAR HELIUM\r\n\r\nHelium, as its name implies, is of solar origin. In 1868, when\r\nLockyer first directed his spectroscope to the great flames or\r\nprominences that rise thousands of miles, sometimes hundreds of\r\nthousands, above the surface of the sun, he instantly identified\r\nthe characteristic red and blue radiations of hydrogen. In the\r\nyellow, close to the position of the well-known double line of\r\nsodium, but not quite coincident with it, he detected a new line,\r\nof great brilliancy, extending to the highest levels. Its similarity\r\nin this respect with the lines of hydrogen led him to recognize\r\nthe existence of a new and very light gas, unknown to terrestrial\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\nMany years passed before any chemical laboratory on earth was able\r\nto match this product of the great laboratory of the sun. In 1896\r\nRamsay at last succeeded in separating helium, recognized by the same\r\nyellow line in its spectrum, in minute quantities from the mineral\r\nuraninite. Once available for study under electrical excitation in\r\nvacuum tubes, helium was found to have many other lines in its\r\nspectrum, which have been identified in the spectra of solar\r\nprominences, gaseous nebulæ, and hot stars. Indeed, there is a\r\nstellar class known as helium stars, because of the dominance of\r\nthis gas in their atmospheres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Solar prominences, photographed with the\r\nspectroheliograph without an eclipse (Ellerman).\r\n\r\nIn these luminous gaseous clouds, which sometimes rise to elevations\r\nexceeding half the sun's diameter, the new gas helium was discovered\r\nby Lockyer in 1868. Helium was not found on the earth until 1896.\r\nSince then it has been shown to be a prominent constituent of nebulæ\r\nand hot stars.]\r\n\r\nThe chief importance of helium lies in the clue it has afforded to\r\nthe constitution of matter and the transmutation of the elements.\r\nRadium and other radioactive substances, such as uranium, spontaneously\r\nemit negatively charged particles of extremely small mass (electrons),\r\nand also positively charged particles of much greater mass, known\r\nas alpha particles. Rutherford and Geiger actually succeeded in\r\ncounting the number of alpha particles emitted per second by a\r\nknown mass of radium, and showed that these were charged helium\r\natoms.\r\n\r\nTo discuss more at length the extraordinary characteristics of\r\nhelium, which plays so large a part in celestial affairs, would\r\ntake us too far afield. Let us therefore pass to another case in\r\nwhich a fundamental discovery, this time in physics, was first\r\nforeshadowed by astronomical observation.\r\n\r\nSUN-SPOTS AS MAGNETS\r\n\r\nNo archæologist, whether Young or Champollion deciphering the Rosetta\r\nStone, or Rawlinson copying the cuneiform inscription on the cliff\r\nof Behistun, was ever faced by a more fascinating problem than that\r\nwhich confronts the solar physicist engaged in the interpretation\r\nof the hieroglyphic lines of sun-spot spectra. The colossal whirling\r\nstorms that constitute sun-spots, so vast that the earth would make\r\nbut a moment's scant mouthful for them, differ materially from\r\nthe general light of the sun when examined with the spectroscope.\r\nObserving them visually many years ago, the late Professor Young,\r\nof Princeton, found among their complex features a number of double\r\nlines which he naturally attributed, in harmony with the physical\r\nknowledge of the time, to the effect of \"reversal\" by superposed\r\nlayers of vapors of different density and temperature. What he\r\nactually saw, however, as was proved at the Mount Wilson Observatory\r\nin 1908, was the effect of a powerful magnetic field on radiation,\r\nnow known as the Zeeman effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. The 150-foot tower telescope of the Mount\r\nWilson Observatory.\r\n\r\nAn image of the sun about 16 inches in diameter is formed in the\r\nlaboratory at the base of the tower. Below this, in a well extending\r\n80 feet into the earth, is the powerful spectroscope with which\r\nthe magnetic fields in sun-spots and the general magnetic field\r\nof the sun are studied.]\r\n\r\nFaraday was the first to detect the influence of magnetism on light.\r\nBetween the poles of a large electromagnet, powerful for those\r\ndays (1845), he placed a block of very dense glass. The plane of\r\npolarization of a beam of light, which passed unaffected through\r\nthe glass before the switch was closed, was seen to rotate when the\r\nmagnetic field was produced by the flow of the current. A similar\r\nrotation is now familiar in the well-known tests of sugars--lævulose\r\nand dextrose--which rotate plane-polarized light to left and right,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nBut in this first discovery of a relationship between light and\r\nmagnetism Faraday had not taken the more important step that he\r\ncoveted--to determine whether the vibration period of a light-emitting\r\nparticle is subject to change in a magnetic field. He attempted\r\nthis in 1862--the last experiment of his life. A sodium flame was\r\nplaced between the poles of a magnet, and the yellow lines were\r\nwatched in a spectroscope when the magnet was excited. No change\r\ncould be detected, and none was found by subsequent investigators\r\nuntil Zeeman, of Leiden, with more powerful instruments made his\r\nfamous discovery, the twenty-fifth anniversary of which has recently\r\nbeen celebrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Pasadena Laboratory of the Mount Wilson\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\nShowing the large magnet (on the left) and the spectroscopes used\r\nfor the study of the effect of magnetism on radiation. A single line\r\nin the spectrum is split by the magnetic field into from three to\r\ntwenty-one components, as illustrated in Fig. 34. The corresponding\r\nlines in the spectra of sun-spots are split up in precisely the\r\nsame way, thus indicating the presence of powerful magnetic fields\r\nin the sun.]\r\n\r\nHis method of procedure was similar to Faraday's, but his magnet and\r\nspectroscope were much more powerful, and a theory due to Lorentz,\r\npredicting the nature of the change to be expected, was available\r\nas a check on his results. When the current was applied the lines\r\nwere seen to widen. In a still more powerful magnetic field each\r\nof them split into two components (when the observation was made\r\nalong the lines of force), and the light of the components of each\r\nline was found to be circularly polarized in opposite directions.\r\nStrictly in harmony with Lorentz's theory, this splitting and\r\npolarization proved the presence in the luminous vapor of exactly such\r\nnegatively charged electrons as had been indicated there previously\r\nby very different experimental methods.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 great cyclonic storms, or vortices, were discovered at\r\nthe Mount Wilson Observatory centring in sun-spots. Such whirling\r\nmasses of hot vapors, inferred from Sir Joseph Thomson's results\r\nto contain electrically charged particles, should give rise to a\r\nmagnetic field. This hypothesis at once suggested that the double\r\nlines observed by Young might really represent the Zeeman effect.\r\nThe test was made, and all the characteristic phenomena of radiation\r\nin a magnetic field were found.\r\n\r\nThus a great physical experiment is constantly being performed\r\nfor us in the sun. Every large sunspot contains a magnetic field\r\ncovering many thousands of square miles, within which the spectrum\r\nlines of iron, manganese, chromium, titanium, vanadium, calcium,\r\nand other metallic vapors are so powerfully affected that their\r\nwidening and splitting can be seen with telescopes and spectroscopes\r\nof moderate size.\r\n\r\nTHE TOWER TELESCOPE\r\n\r\nBoth of these illustrations show how the physicist and chemist,\r\nwhen adequately armed for astronomical attack, can take advantage\r\nin their studies of the stupendous processes visible in cosmic\r\ncrucibles, heated to high temperatures and influenced, as in the\r\ncase of sun-spots, by intense magnetic fields. Certain modern\r\ninstruments, like the 60-foot and 150-foot tower telescopes on\r\nMount Wilson, are especially designed for observing the course\r\nof these experiments. The second of these telescopes produces at\r\na fixed point in a laboratory an image of the sun about 16 inches\r\nin diameter, thus enlarging the sun-spots to such a scale that\r\nthe magnetic phenomena of their various parts can be separately\r\nstudied. This analysis is accomplished with a spectroscope 80 feet\r\nin length, mounted in a subterranean chamber beneath the tower. The\r\nvaried results of such investigations cannot be described here.\r\nOnly one of them may be mentioned--the discovery that the entire sun,\r\nrotating on its axis, is a great magnet. Hence we may reasonably\r\ninfer that every star, and probably every planet, is also a magnet,\r\nas the earth has been known to be since the days of Gilbert's \"De\r\nMagnete.\" Here lies one of the best clues for the physicist who\r\nseeks the cause of magnetism, and attempts to produce it, as Barnett\r\nhas recently succeeded in doing, by rapidly whirling masses of\r\nmetal in the laboratory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. Sun-spot vortex in the upper hydrogen\r\natmosphere. (Benioff).\r\n\r\nPhotographed with the spectroheliograph. The electric vortex that\r\ncauses the magnetic field of the spot lies at a lower level, and\r\nis not shown by such photographs.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps a word of caution should be interpolated at this point.\r\nSolar magnetism in no wise accounts for the sun's gravitational\r\npower. Indeed, its attraction cannot be felt by the most delicate\r\ninstruments at the distance of the earth, and would still be unknown\r\nwere it not for the influence of magnetism on light.\r\n\r\nAuroras, magnetic storms, and such electric currents as those that\r\nrecently deranged several Atlantic cables are due, not to the magnetism\r\nof the sun or its spots, but probably to streams of electrons, shot\r\nout from highly disturbed areas of the solar surface surrounding\r\ngreat sun-spots, traversing ninety-three million miles of the ether\r\nof space, and penetrating deep into the earth's atmosphere. These\r\nstriking phenomena lead us into another chapter of physics, which\r\nlimitations of space forbid us to pursue.\r\n\r\nSTELLAR CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\nLet us turn again to chemistry, and see where experiments performed\r\nin cosmic laboratories can serve as a guide to the investigator.\r\nA spinning solar tornado, incomparably greater in scale than the\r\ndevastating whirlwinds that so often cut narrow paths of destruction\r\nthrough town and country in the Middle West, gradually gives rise\r\nto a sun-spot. The expansion produced by the centrifugal force at\r\nthe centre of the storm cools the intensely hot gases of the solar\r\natmosphere to a point where chemical union can occur. Titanium\r\nand oxygen, too hot to combine in most regions of the sun, join\r\nto form the vapor of titanium oxide, characterized in the sunspot\r\nspectrum by fluted bands, made up of hundreds of regularly spaced\r\nlines. Similarly magnesium and hydrogen combine as magnesium hydride\r\nand calcium and hydrogen form calcium hydride. None of these compounds,\r\nstable at the high temperatures of sun-spots, has been much studied\r\nin the laboratory. The regions in which they exist, though cooler\r\nthan the general atmosphere of the sun, are at temperatures of\r\nseveral thousand degrees, attained in our laboratories only with\r\nthe aid of such devices as powerful electric furnaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. Splitting of spectrum lines by a magnetic\r\nfield (Babcock).\r\n\r\nThe upper and lower strips show lines in the spectrum of chromium,\r\nobserved without a magnetic field. When subjected to the influence\r\nof magnetism, these single lines are split into several components.\r\nThus the first line on the right is resolved by the field into\r\nthree components, one of which (plane polarized) appears in the\r\nsecond strip, while the other two, which are polarized in a plane\r\nat right angles to that of the middle component, are shown on the\r\nthird strip. The next line is split by the magnetic field into\r\ntwelve components, four of which appear in the second strip and\r\neight in the third. The magnetic fields in sun-spots affect these\r\nlines in precisely the same way.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to follow our line of reasoning to the stars,\r\nwhich differ widely in temperature at various stages in their\r\nlife-cycle.[*] A sun-spot is a solar tornado, wherein the intensely\r\nhot solar vapors are cooled by expansion, giving rise to the compounds\r\nalready named. A red star, in Russell's scheme of stellar evolution,\r\nis a cooler sun, vast in volume and far more tenuous than atmospheric\r\nair when in the initial period of the \"giant\" stage, but compressed\r\nand denser than water in the \"dwarf\" stage, into which our sun has\r\nalready entered as it gradually approaches the last phases of its\r\nexistence. Therefore we should find, throughout the entire atmosphere\r\nof such stars, some of the same compounds that are produced within\r\nthe comparatively small limits of a sun-spot. This, of course,\r\non the correct assumption that sun and stars are made of the same\r\nsubstances. Fowler has already identified the bands of titanium\r\noxide in such red stars as the giant Betelgeuse, and in others\r\nof its class. It is safe to predict that an interesting chapter\r\nin the chemistry of the future will be based upon the study of\r\nsuch compounds, both in the laboratory and under the progressive\r\ntemperature conditions afforded by the countless stellar \"giants\"\r\nand \"dwarfs\" that precede and follow the solar state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: See Chapter II.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. Electric furnace in the Pasadena laboratory\r\nof the Mount Wilson Observatory.\r\n\r\nWith which the chemical phenomena observed in sun-spots and red\r\nstars are experimentally imitated.]\r\n\r\nASTROPHYSICAL LABORATORIES\r\n\r\nIt is precisely in this long sequence of physical and chemical\r\nchanges that the astrophysicist and the astrochemist can find the\r\nmeans of pushing home their attack. It is true, of course, that\r\nthe laboratory investigator has a great advantage in his ability\r\nto control his experiments, and to vary their progress at will.\r\nBut by judicious use of the transcendental temperatures, far out\r\nranging those of his furnaces, and extreme conditions, which he\r\ncan only partially imitate, afforded by the sun, stars, and nebulæ,\r\nhe may greatly widen the range of his inquiries. The sequence of\r\nphenomena seen during the growth of a sun-spot, or the observation\r\nof spots of different sizes, and the long series of successive\r\nsteps that mark the rise and decay of stellar life, resemble the\r\nchanges that the experimenter brings about as he increases and\r\ndiminishes the current in the coils of his magnet or raises and\r\nlowers the temperature of his electric furnace, examining from\r\ntime to time the spectrum of the glowing vapors, and noting the\r\nchanges shown by the varying appearance of their lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. Titanium oxide in red stars.\r\n\r\nThe upper spectrum is that of titanium in the flame of the electric\r\narc, where its combination with oxygen gives rise to the bands of\r\ntitanium oxide (Fowler). The lower strip shows the spectrum of\r\nthe red star Mira (Omicron Ceti), as drawn by Cortie at Stonyhurst.\r\nThe bands of titanium oxide are clearly present in the star.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. Titanium oxide in sun-spots.\r\n\r\nThe upper strip shows a portion of the spectrum of a sun-spot\r\n(Ellerman); the lower one the corresponding region of the spectrum\r\nof titanium oxide (King). The fluted bands of the oxide spectrum\r\nare easily identified in the spot, where they indicate that titanium\r\nand oxygen, too hot to combine in the solar atmosphere, unite in the\r\nspot because of the cooling produced by expansion in the vortex.]\r\n\r\nAstronomical observations of this character, it should be noted, are\r\nmost effective when constantly tested and interpreted by laboratory\r\nexperiment. Indeed, a modern astrophysical observatory should be\r\nequipped like a great physical laboratory, provided on the one hand\r\nwith telescopes and accessory apparatus of the greatest attainable\r\npower, and on the other with every device known to the investigator\r\nof radiation and the related physical and chemical phenomena. Its\r\ntelescopes, especially designed with the aims of the physicist and\r\nchemist in view, bring images of sun, stars, nebulæ, and other\r\nheavenly bodies within the reach of powerful spectroscopes, sensitive\r\nbolometers and thermopiles, and the long array of other appliances\r\navailable for the measurement and analysis of radiation. Its electric\r\nfurnaces, arcs, sparks, and vacuum tubes, its apparatus for increasing\r\nand decreasing pressure, varying chemical conditions, and subjecting\r\nluminous gases and vapors to the influence of electric and magnetic\r\nfields, provide the means of imitating celestial phenomena, and of\r\nrepeating and interpreting the experiments observed at the telescope.\r\nAnd the advantage thus derived, as we have seen, is not confined\r\nto the astronomer, who has often been able, by making fundamental\r\nphysical and chemical discoveries, to repay his debt to the physicist\r\nand chemist for the apparatus and methods which he owes to them.\r\n\r\nNEWTON AND EINSTEIN\r\n\r\nTake, for another example, the greatest law of physics--Newton's\r\nlaw of gravitation. Huge balls of lead, as used by Cavendish, produce\r\nby their gravitational effect a minute rotation of a delicately\r\nsuspended bar, carrying smaller balls at its extremities. But no\r\nsuch feeble means sufficed for Newton's purpose. To prove the law\r\nof gravitation he had recourse to the tremendous pull on the moon\r\nof the entire mass of the earth, and then extended his researches\r\nto the mutual attractions of all the bodies of the solar system.\r\nLater Herschel applied this law to the suns which constitute double\r\nstars, and to-day Adams observes from Mount Wilson stars falling\r\nwith great velocity toward the centre of the galactic system under\r\nthe combined pull of the millions of objects that compose it. Thus\r\nfull advantage has been taken of the possibility of utilizing the\r\ngreat masses of the heavenly bodies for the discovery and application\r\nof a law of physics and its reciprocal use in explaining celestial\r\nmotions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. The Cavendish experiment.\r\n\r\nTwo lead balls, each two inches in diameter, are attached to the\r\nends of a torsion rod six feet long, which is suspended by a fine\r\nwire. The experiment consists in measuring the rotation of the\r\nsuspended system, caused by the gravitational attraction of two\r\nlead spheres, each twelve inches in diameter, acting on the two\r\nsmall lead balls.]\r\n\r\nOr consider the Einstein theory of relativity, the truth or falsity\r\nof which is no less fundamental to physics. Its inception sprang from\r\nthe Michelson-Morley experiment, made in a laboratory in Cleveland,\r\nwhich showed that motion of the earth through the ether of space could\r\nnot be detected. All of the three chief tests of Einstein's general\r\ntheory are astronomical--because of the great masses required to\r\nproduce the minute effects predicted: the motion of the perihelion\r\nof Mercury, the deflection of the light of a star by the attraction\r\nof the sun, and the shift of the lines of the solar spectrum toward\r\nthe red--questions not yet completely answered.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the study of the constitution of matter and the evolution\r\nof the elements, the deepest and most critical problem of physics\r\nand chemistry, that the extremes of pressure and temperature in the\r\nheavenly bodies, and the prevalence of other physical conditions not\r\nyet successfully imitated on earth, promise the greatest progress.\r\nIt fortunately happens that astrophysical research is now at the\r\nvery apex of its development, founded as it is upon many centuries\r\nof astronomical investigation, rejuvenated by the introduction\r\ninto the observatory of all the modern devices of the physicist,\r\nand strengthened with instruments of truly extraordinary range\r\nand power. These instruments bring within reach experiments that\r\nare in progress on some minute region of the sun's disk, or in\r\nsome star too distant even to be glimpsed with ordinary telescopes.\r\nIndeed, the huge astronomical lenses and mirrors now available\r\nserve for these remote light-sources exactly the purpose of the\r\nlens or mirror employed by the physicist to project upon the slit\r\nof his spectroscope the image of a spark or arc or vacuum tube\r\nwithin which atoms and molecules are exposed to the influence of\r\nthe electric discharge. The physicist has the advantage of complete\r\ncontrol over the experimental conditions, while the astrophysicist\r\nmust observe and interpret the experiments performed for him in\r\nremote laboratories. In actual practice, the two classes of work\r\nmust be done in the closest conjunction, if adequate utilization\r\nis to be made of either. And this is only natural, for the trend\r\nof recent research has made clear the fact that one of the three\r\ngreatest problems of modern astronomy and astrophysics, ranking\r\nwith the structure of the universe and the evolution of celestial\r\nbodies, is the constitution of matter. Let us see why this is so.\r\n\r\nTRANSMUTATION OF THE ELEMENTS\r\n\r\nThe dream of the alchemist was to transmute one element into another,\r\nwith the prime object of producing gold. Such transmutation has been\r\nactually accomplished within the last few years, but the process\r\nis invariably one of disintegration--the more complex elements\r\nbeing broken up into simpler constituents. Much remains to be done\r\nin this same direction; and here the stars and nebulæ, which show\r\nthe spectra of the elements under a great variety of conditions,\r\nshould help to point the way. The progressive changes in spectra,\r\nfrom the exclusive indications of the simple elements hydrogen,\r\nhelium, nitrogen, possibly carbon, and the terrestrially unknown\r\ngas nebulium in the gaseous nebulæ, to the long list of familiar\r\nsubstances, including several chemical compounds, in the red stars,\r\nmay prove to be fundamentally significant when adequately studied\r\nfrom the standpoint of the investigator of atomic structure. The\r\nexisting evidence seems to favor the view, recently expressed by\r\nSaha, that many of these differences are due to varying degrees\r\nof ionization, the outer electrons of the atoms being split off\r\nby high temperature or electrical excitation. It is even possible\r\nthat cosmic crucibles, unrivalled by terrestrial ones, may help\r\nmaterially to reveal the secret of the formation of complex elements\r\nfrom simpler ones. Physicists now believe that all of the elements are\r\ncompounded of hydrogen atoms, bound together by negative electrons.\r\nThus helium is made up of four hydrogen atoms, yet the atomic weight\r\nof helium (4) is less than four times that of hydrogen (1.008).\r\nThe difference may represent the mass of the electrical energy\r\nreleased when the transmutation occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. The Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius (Ritchey).\r\n\r\nThe gas \"nebulium,\" not yet found on the earth, is the most\r\ncharacteristic constituent of irregular nebulæ. Nebulium is recognized\r\nby two green lines in its spectrum, which cause the green color of\r\nnebulæ of the gaseous type.]\r\n\r\nEddington has speculated in a most interesting way on this possible\r\nsource of stellar heat in his recent presidential address before the\r\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science (see _Nature_,\r\nSeptember 2, 1920). He points out that the old contraction hypothesis,\r\naccording to which the source of solar and stellar heat was supposed\r\nto reside in the slow condensation of a radiating mass of gas under\r\nthe action of gravity, is wholly inadequate to explain the observed\r\nphenomena. If the old view were correct, the earlier history of\r\na star, from the giant stage of a cool and diaphanous gas to the\r\nperiod of highest temperature, would be run through within eighty\r\nthousand years, whereas we have the best of evidence that many\r\nthousands of centuries would not suffice. Some other source of energy\r\nis imperatively needed. If 5 per cent of a star's mass consists\r\noriginally of hydrogen atoms, which gradually combine in the slow\r\nprocess of time to form more complex elements, the total heat thus\r\nliberated would more than suffice to account for all demands, and\r\nit would be unnecessary to assume the existence of any other source\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Spiral nebula in Ursa Major (Ritchey).\r\n\r\nLuminous matter, in every variety of physical and chemical state,\r\nis available for study in the most diverse celestial objects, from\r\nthe spiral and irregular nebulæ through all the types of stars.\r\nDoctor van Maanen's measures of the Mount Wilson photographs indicate\r\noutward motion along the arms of spiral nebulæ, while the spectroscope\r\nshows them to be whirling at enormous velocities.]\r\n\r\nCOSMIC PRESSURES\r\n\r\nThis, it may fairly be said, is very speculative, but the fact\r\nremains that celestial bodies appear to be the only places in which\r\nthe complex elements may be in actual process of formation from their\r\nknown source--hydrogen. At least we may see what a vast variety\r\nof physical conditions these cosmic crucibles afford. At one end of\r\nthe scale we have the excessively tenuous nebulæ, the luminosity of\r\nwhich, mysterious in its origin, resembles the electric glow in our\r\nvacuum tubes. Here we can detect only the lightest and simplest of\r\nthe elements. In the giant stars, also extremely tenuous (the density\r\nof Betelgeuse can hardly exceed one-thousandth of an atmosphere) we\r\nobserve the spectra of iron, manganese, titanium, calcium, chromium,\r\nmagnesium, vanadium, and sodium, in addition to titanium oxide.\r\nThe outer part of these bodies, from which light reaches us, must\r\ntherefore be at a temperature of only a few thousand degrees, but\r\nvastly higher temperatures must prevail at their centres. In passing\r\nup the temperature curve more and more elements appear, the surface\r\ntemperature rises, and the internal temperature may reach millions\r\nof degrees. At the same time the pressure within must also rise,\r\nreaching enormous figures in the last stages of stellar life. Cook\r\nhas calculated that the pressure at the centre of the earth is\r\nbetween 4,000 and 10,000 tons per square inch, and this must be\r\nonly a very small fraction of that attained within larger celestial\r\nbodies. Jeans has computed the pressure at the centre of two colliding\r\nstars as they strike and flatten, and finds it may be of the order\r\nof 1,000,000,000 tons per square inch--sufficient, if their diameter\r\nbe equal to that of the sun--to vaporize them 100,000 times over.\r\n\r\nCompare these pressures with the highest that can be produced on\r\nearth. If the German gun that bombarded Paris were loaded with a\r\nsolid steel projectile of suitable dimensions, a muzzle velocity\r\nof 6,000 feet per second could be reached. Suppose this to be fired\r\ninto a tapered hole in a great block of steel. The instantaneous\r\npressure, according to Cook, would be about 7,000 tons per square\r\ninch, only 1/150000 of that possible through the collision of the\r\nlargest stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Mount San Antonio as seen from Mount Wilson.\r\n\r\nMichelson is measuring the velocity of light between stations on\r\nMount Wilson and Mount San Antonio. Astronomical observations afford\r\nthe best means, however, of detecting any possible difference between\r\nthe velocities of light of different colors. From studies of variable\r\nstars in the cluster Messier 5 Shapley concludes that if there is\r\nany difference between the velocities of blue and yellow light\r\nin free space it cannot exceed two inches in one second, the time\r\nin which light travels 186,000 miles.]\r\n\r\nFinally, we may compare the effects of light pressure on the earth\r\nand stars. Twenty years ago Nichols and Hull succeeded, with the\r\naid of the most sensitive apparatus, in measuring the minute\r\ndisplacements produced by the pressure of light. The effect is\r\nso slight, even with the brightest light-sources available, that\r\ngreat experimental skill is required to measure it. Yet in the\r\ncase of some of the larger stars Eddington calculates that one-half\r\nof their mass is supported by radiation pressure, and this against\r\ntheir enormous gravitational attraction. In fact, if their mass\r\nwere as great as ten times that of the sun, the radiation pressure\r\nwould so nearly overcome the pull of gravitation that they would\r\nbe likely to break up.\r\n\r\nBut enough has been said to illustrate the wide variety of experimental\r\ndevices that stand at our service in the laboratories of the heavens.\r\nHere the physicist and chemist of the future will more and more\r\nfrequently supplement their terrestrial apparatus, and find new\r\nclues to the complex problems which the amazing progress of recent\r\nyears has already done so much to solve.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL VALUE OF RESEARCHES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER\r\n\r\nThe layman has no difficulty in recognizing the practical value\r\nof researches directed toward the improvement of the incandescent\r\nlamp or the increased efficiency of the telephone. He can see the\r\nresults in the greatly decreased cost of electric illumination\r\nand the rapid extension of the range of the human voice. But the\r\nvery men who have made these advances, those who have succeeded\r\nbeyond all expectation in accomplishing the economic purposes in\r\nview, are most emphatic in their insistence upon the importance\r\nof research of a more fundamental character. Thus Vice-President\r\nJ. J. Carty, of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, who\r\ndirects its great Department of Development and Research, and Doctor\r\nW. J. Whitney, Director of the Research Laboratory of the General\r\nElectric Company, have repeatedly expressed their indebtedness\r\nto the investigations of the physicist, made with no thought of\r\nimmediate practical return. Faraday, studying the laws of electricity,\r\ndiscovered the principle which rendered the dynamo possible. Maxwell,\r\nHenry, and Hertz, equally unconcerned with material advantage,\r\nmade wireless telegraphy practicable. In fact, all truly great\r\nadvances are thus derived from fundamental science, and the future\r\nprogress of the world will be largely dependent upon the provision\r\nmade for scientific research, especially in the fields of physics\r\nand chemistry, which underlie all branches of engineering.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of matter, therefore, instead of appealing as\r\na subject to research only to the natural philosopher or to the\r\ngeneral student of science, is a question of the greatest practical\r\nconcern. Already the by-products of investigations directed toward\r\nits elucidation have been numerous and useful in the highest degree.\r\nHelium has been already cited; X-rays hardly require mention; radium,\r\nwhich has so materially aided sufferers from cancer, is still better\r\nknown. Wireless telephony and transcontinental telephony with wires\r\nwere both rendered possible by studies of the nature of the electric\r\ndischarge in vacuum tubes. Thus the \"practical man,\" with his distrust\r\nof \"pure\" science, need not resent investments made for the purpose\r\nof advancing our knowledge of such fundamental subjects as physics\r\nand chemistry. On the contrary, if true to his name, he should\r\nhelp to multiply them many fold in the interest of economic and\r\ncommercial development.",
