All of the figures are drawn to the same scale, a\r\nmagnification of eight hundred diameters, from specimens in my possession,\r\nnearly all of which were found in or near Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIf the work is of any value in inducing further investigation, I hope, in\r\nthe words of Julien Deby, that \"those who follow my advice will find in the\r\nstudy of these wonderful little organisms as much pleasure as I myself have\r\nfound.\"\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{5}INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Delaware River rises in the Western Catskill Mountains, flows southward\r\nfor about three hundred and seventy-five miles, and expands into Delaware\r\nBay about sixty miles from the sea. Its origin is among the Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous rocks, and in its course it passes through Silurian, Triassic\r\nand Cretaceous formations, finally reaching the Cambrian and Laurentian\r\nbeds. It also drains regions of the glacial drift and beds which overlie\r\noverturned Miocene strata, and are sometimes mixed with them. From the\r\nmountains, nearly four thousand feet high, to the Bay, where the depth of\r\nwater is not greater than seventy-five feet, the diatomaceous flora, from\r\nAlpine cascades to the salt marshes of New Jersey, contains a larger number\r\nof species than any other equal portion of the American coast.\r\n\r\nThe city of Philadelphia, about one hundred miles from the sea, lies at the\r\njunction of the Schuylkill with the Delaware, and much of the land near the\r\nrivers, especially southward, is flat and low, composed of recent alluvial\r\ndeposits. In the central districts the ground is high, the deep sub-soil\r\nbeing mostly a dry gravel resting upon gneiss and schist, although it is in\r\npart composed of a bluish clay which was probably laid down in the bed of\r\nthe ancient river before the last period of the glacial drift. The blue\r\nclay was not all deposited at the same time, as in the lower strata many\r\nmarine forms are found which do not occur in the upper layers. This is\r\nnotably the case in a deposit obtained at Spreckel's Sugar Refinery and\r\nalso at the east end of Walnut Street Bridge, where a layer of blue clay\r\noccurs which is overlain by glacial drift. In other parts of the city\r\nmixtures of blue clay with more recent deposits are found, including\r\nfresh-water forms from numerous creeks and rivulets which traversed what is\r\nnow the city proper, and especially from the vicinity of Fourth and Market\r\nStreets, where there existed as late as the year 1700 a large pond known as\r\nthe \"Duck Pond\" which was subject to tidal overflow from its outlet, Dock\r\nCreek. The river water at Philadelphia is not noticeably brackish, although\r\nthe tide extends thirty miles above the city and, before the building of\r\nFairmount Dam, to the Falls of the Schuylkill. At certain times, when the\r\nriver is low, the influx of tide water is sufficient to produce an\r\nabundance of brackish water diatoms at Greenwich Point. The entire absence,\r\nhowever, at present, of many of the marine forms obtained in dredgings in\r\nthe Delaware opposite the city, as at Smith's Island, now removed, and in\r\ncertain well borings at Pavonia, Pensauken, Gloucester and other places in\r\nNew Jersey, where the depth reached the old blue clay, indicates conditions\r\nquite different from those now prevalent. In the Bay itself comparatively\r\nfew living species are found, at least in any abundance.\r\n\r\nIn the study of local forms which follows, the district included may be\r\nconsidered as circumscribed by the circumference of a circle having a\r\nradius of one hundred miles from Philadelphia, containing the States of New\r\nJersey and Delaware, the southeastern part of {6}Pennsylvania, a portion of\r\nMaryland on the south and extending eastward to New York Bay and Long\r\nIsland Sound as far as New Rochelle.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of fresh-water species described have been obtained from\r\nnear the city along the Darby, Crum, Ridley and Brandywine Creeks and from\r\nvarious places in New Jersey, including the Pine Barren region of the\r\nsouthern part of the State. Numerous collections have been made in the\r\nSchuylkill and the various reservoirs and along the Wissahickon, \"where an\r\nAlpine gorge in miniature of singular loveliness is to be found within the\r\nlimits of a city.\" The fossil deposits are from well borings near Camden,\r\nN. J., and from excavations in various parts of the city.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no relation between the Miocene beds of the eastern\r\ncoast and the deposits here described, all of which have been formed later\r\nthan the glacial period or in an interval between two such periods.\r\nApparently no diatoms grew during the glacial era, at least in sufficient\r\nabundance to leave any perceptible traces of their existence. An\r\nexamination of glacial \"flour\" and clays from the Catskills shows an entire\r\nabsence of these forms, and I have never found them in the milky flow from\r\nthe glaciers of the Alps nor in the constantly muddy streams in certain of\r\nour Western States. The opacity of the water produces the same result as\r\nthe absence of light in the deep lakes of New England, where diatoms are\r\nfound only on the stalks or roots of water-plants near the shore, while in\r\nshallow ponds, such as the small lake near the summit of Mt. Lafayette, the\r\ngrowth is abundant. Certain species will grow wherever there are moisture,\r\nlight and heat, but the greater number require the presence, in small\r\namounts, of substances produced by the decay of animal and vegetable life.\r\nAn abundance of diatoms in fresh water is usually an indication of its\r\npotability, while their entire absence in shallow water may be due to an\r\nexcess of bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from which the drawings are made have been collected by the\r\nauthor for many years; in addition to possessing an almost complete library\r\non the subject, he has had the advantage of examining material obtained by\r\nthe late Mr. Lewis Woolman and numerous slides furnished by a number of\r\nfriends, including Mr. John A. Shulze, Mr. Frank J. Keeley and Mr. T.\r\nChalkley Palmer, to whom I here take pleasure in expressing my thanks.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the study are well stated by Agardh in the following\r\nextract from the preface to his Systema Algarum:\r\n\r\n\"Because, indeed, in this respect, no one will wonder whether in the\r\ndistinction of species and reference to synonyms we have, perchance,\r\ncommitted many errors. They have occurred and are bound to occur, partly\r\nfrom the fact that one is not permitted to see the original specimens of\r\nall authors; partly, because sometimes even the original specimens of these\r\nplants are erroneous; partly, because the figures and descriptions of\r\nauthors are often lacking and imperfect....\r\n\r\n\"There is added the difficulty of the study itself of these plants, their\r\nsubmerged habitat, the minuteness of their structure, the rarity of their\r\nfruit, the change in the dried {7}plant, the impossibility of culture, the\r\nfallacies of microscopical vision and the chaotic condition of Algology\r\nitself to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe words of Agardh, written in 1824, are almost as true to-day. The lack\r\nof authentic specimens, which we hope will be remedied in time by the\r\ncollections of the Smithsonian Institute, numerous incorrectly labelled\r\nslides in amateur collections, the imperfections of figures copied and\r\nrecopied, without regard to relative size or correct references, and the\r\nconfusion in the attempts to harmonize different descriptions, deter the\r\nstudent at the outset. The remaining difficulties mentioned by Agardh add,\r\nhowever, to the remarkable interest these forms have always had, since no\r\nincrease in optical perfection of the microscope serves to lessen the\r\nmystery of their structure and mode of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\nThe few species of diatoms first discovered were included by Lyngbye,\r\nDillwyn, and others in the genus _Conferva_. In 1824, the species,\r\nincreased to forty-eight, were separated by Agardh into eight genera\r\ndistinguished partly by their mode of growth. But little change was made\r\nuntil Heiberg, in 1863, advocated the division into symmetrical and\r\nasymmetrical forms. Without entering upon a general review of the later\r\nclassifications, including Pfitzer's and Petit's divisions according to the\r\nnumber and location of the chromatophores, or the arrangement of Prof. H.\r\nL. Smith, because of the presence or absence of a raphe, or that of\r\nMereschkowsky into motile and immotile forms, the modification of all of\r\nthese methods by Schuett is here adopted, varied in accordance with certain\r\nmonographs which appear to offer advantage.\r\n\r\nIt is customary, especially among writers who are familiar with other\r\nclasses of plants, to decry any classification of diatoms according to the\r\nmarkings of their siliceous envelopes. As, however, one of the chief\r\ndistinctions of the class is the possession of a more or less siliceous and\r\nindestructible frustule, and as the cell and its contents are never seen\r\nexcept within the valves, their variety forms the only available method of\r\nidentification. The cell contents, owing to the difficulty of observing\r\ntheir living condition, their continued change, their lack of distinct\r\nvariation and their entire absence in fossil forms, render their\r\nconsideration as a complete method of classification an impossibility. If,\r\nhowever, the cell contents can be brought into relation with the markings\r\nof their siliceous envelope, it will be a consummation for which the future\r\nstudent of these complicated forms ought to be grateful. That this result\r\nis one to be expected may be inferred from the fact that the arrangement of\r\nprotoplasmic masses in the interior of the cell is coincident in some cases\r\nwith markings on the valve, and the character of the endochrome is assuming\r\na certain value in accentuating the difference between such forms as\r\n_Pleurosigma_ and _Gyrosigma_, or in the resemblance between _Hantzschia_\r\nand _Nitzschia_, or between _Surirella_ and _Campylodiscus_. Mereschkowsky,\r\nhowever, states that it is necessary to be careful in \"establishing the\r\nrelationship between diatoms based on the resemblance of their\r\nchromatophores,\" {8}and further observes that in _Hantzschia amphioxys_,\r\n_Scoliotropis latestriata_ and _Achnanthes brevipes_, three widely\r\nseparated forms, the chromatophores are essentially the same.\r\n\r\nIn one of the earliest classifications of diatoms, the individual cell\r\nreceived less consideration than the nature of the filament or thallus in\r\nwhich many species occur in the first stages of their growth. Those,\r\nhowever, which exist in colonies at first are, sooner or later, broken up\r\ninto separate frustules, either before or at the time of their maturity or\r\nprevious to conjugation, while very many species are never seen except in a\r\nfree state. The union of frustules, therefore, is of secondary importance\r\nand the group must be considered as filamentous or unicellular algæ. Their\r\nrelation to other algæ is not well determined. Among the _Desmidiaceæ_, a\r\nfamily of the order _Conjugales_, of the class _Chlorophyceæ_, the cells\r\nare in many forms divided by a constriction into symmetrical halves. The\r\nConjugales are starch forming, with walls of cellulose. In the Diatomaceæ\r\nthe starch is replaced by oil globules, while the walls of cellulose are\r\nmore or less filled with a deposit of silica. The Conjugales, however,\r\nreproduce by zygospores and usually contain pyrenoids, as may be seen in\r\nthe parietal chromatophores of _Spirogyra_. In the class _Heterokontæ_ we\r\nhave the reserve material in the form of oil, instead of starch, but there\r\nare no pyrenoids. To this class belongs the order _Confervaceæ_, in which\r\nthe cells are unicellular or filamentous, and to which all of the\r\nDiatomaceæ were referred. While, therefore, Diatomaceæ have a close\r\naffinity to the Desmidiaceæ and to the Confervaceæ, the determination of\r\ntheir origin, one from another, or from a common ancestral type, appears to\r\nbe a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{9}MORPHOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CELL\r\n\r\nThe cell membrane is composed of two usually equal parts, each of which\r\nconsists of a valve and a girdle or zone formed of cellulose modified by\r\nsilica deposited in an insoluble state from a very dilute aqueous solution.\r\nThe valves are more siliceous and robust than the girdle. Both are in most\r\nspecies easily separable, or at least the bands of the girdle which may be\r\nmore or less closely fastened to the valves have a motion over each other\r\npermitting the cell to enlarge at pleasure. The longitudinal diameter of\r\nthe cell, or the distance between the centres of the two valves, will vary\r\naccording to the convexity of the valve and the age of the frustule which\r\nmay be often determined by the width or number of the girdle bands. These,\r\nowing to their diversity of form and arrangement, will be further described\r\nunder the generic diagnoses.\r\n\r\nThe siliceous cell-wall is covered on the outside by a layer of protoplasm\r\ncalled the coleoderm. This layer may be quite thin and evident only when\r\ntreated with fuchsin or Bismarck brown, or it may be of considerable\r\nthickness. The cell contains the cytoplasma, protoplasm, cell-sap,\r\nendochrome, pyrenoids, oil globules and nucleus, together with certain\r\nother less understood bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Cytoplasma is a thin skin of colorless plasma covering the entire inner\r\nsurface of the cell. It is invisible in the living cell but is evident in\r\nplasmolysis. In long forms it is thickened at the ends and is condensed at\r\nthe plasma bridge which frequently connects the two valves and divides the\r\ncell into two parts, each containing more or less protoplasm surrounding\r\nthe vacuole in which are found the cell-sap and certain granules. In some\r\nforms, as Meloseira, the cytoplasma includes the entire mass of protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThe Endochrome is seen in the form of one or more bands or plates, of a\r\nyellowish or brownish color, on the inner side of the valves or connective\r\nzone, or in granules or irregular masses, more or less numerous, on the\r\ninner walls, or sometimes grouped near the centre. It consists of a mixture\r\nof chlorophyll and diatomine which differ in their relative solubility in\r\nalcohol and in their spectroscopic analyses. The color varies from green to\r\na chocolate brown in proportion to the amount of diatomine. So far as the\r\nfunction of the endochrome is concerned it does not appear to differ from\r\nthat of ordinary chlorophyll, absorbing, under the influence of light, the\r\ncarbon, and disengaging the oxygen of the carbonic anhydride in the water.\r\nDiatoms do not live in absolutely pure or non-aërated water. The individual\r\nplates or granules of the endochrome are called chromatophores. Their\r\nnumber and significance will be referred to in the description of genera.\r\n\r\nTHE PYRENOIDS.--In the chromatophores of many species are found colorless,\r\nhomogeneous bodies, strongly refractive, of various shapes, usually\r\nlenticular or fusiform, which are known as Pyrenoids (Schmitz). They are\r\nscarcely evident in the living cell, but are distinguished by the action of\r\nhæmatoxylin and other reagents. Flat forms occur in Surirella and\r\nPleurosigma, lens forms in Pinnularia, Stauroneis, Synedra, Fragilaria and\r\nNitzschia, while a spherical form is found in Cymbella cuspidata. The\r\npyrenoids are always imbedded in the chromatophore. Their growth is by\r\ndivision. Schmitz considers them a part of the living chromatophore, and\r\ntheir substance as working material which in excess has become resolved\r\ninto the nature of a crystal which its form sometimes resembles.\r\nComparisons are made between them and crystalloids found in certain\r\nmonocotyledons. The pyrenoid is evidently concerned in the formation of the\r\nchromatophore, or in its division. Much of the conjecture, however, is due\r\nto the behavior of pyrenoids in other plants.\r\n\r\n{10}OIL GLOBULES.--It has been established by Pfitzer that starch and\r\nsugar, as assimilation products, are replaced by oil in the cells of\r\ndiatoms (\"da bekannlich Staerke und Zucker bei den Bacillariaceen nicht\r\nnachzuweisen sind\"). The oil drops are more or less numerous, of various\r\nsizes, and are found in the cytoplasma, the cell-sap, and sometimes the\r\nchromatophores. Mereschkowsky describes certain globules as elæoplasts,\r\nwhich he divides into four kinds according to their number and position.\r\nWhether all of these are oil globules is a question not yet determined.\r\n\r\nOther bodies, known as \"Buetschli granules,\" or volutin, and described as\r\n\"little blisters filled with a tolerably robust refractive substance,\" are\r\nconsidered by Lauterborn to be a nitrogen reserve store. They are found in\r\nthe cytoplasma, or in the cell-sap, and can be fixed in picric acid and\r\nstained in methylene blue.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--For a discussion of the morphology of diatoms and a valuable résumé\r\nof the investigations of Buetschli, Karsten, Lauterborn, Mereschkowsky,\r\nMueller, Pfitzer, Schuett, and others, the student is referred to \"Der Bau\r\nder Diatomzelle,\" by Dr. Otto Heinzerling, in \"Bibliotheca Botanica,\" 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELL DIVISION\r\n\r\nThe growth of diatoms follows the usual method of cell division as\r\ndescribed by Sachs (Text Book of Botany, 2nd ed., p. 16): \"The nucleus of a\r\ncell which is about to divide becomes broader, assuming the form of a\r\nbiconcave lens, and its nucleolus breaks up into irregular granules which\r\ntogether with its other granular contents begin to form a nuclear disc in\r\nthe equatorial plane. A delicate striation is now apparent in what is\r\nbecoming the long axis of the nucleus, at right angles to the nuclear disc,\r\nand the characteristic nuclear spindle is gradually produced. The nuclear\r\ndisc splits into two halves lying side by side, each of which travels to\r\nthe corresponding pole of the nucleus; thus two nuclei are constituted\r\nwhich are connected by fibrillæ.\"\r\n\r\nThe cell-wall and the chromatophore bands divide, each nucleus passes to\r\nthe centre, and two new cells are formed. In the meantime, to permit of\r\nthis division, the two siliceous valves separate, the girdle bands slipping\r\nover each other, and opposite the larger or enclosing valve a new valve is\r\nformed, the girdle band of which is seen later within the girdle of the\r\nmother valve. Opposite the smaller valve of the original cell and adjoining\r\nthe new valve, another valve is formed which also produces a girdle within\r\nthe girdle of the smaller valve. As a result of division we have,\r\ntherefore, the valves of the original, or mother cell, the two new valves\r\nand four girdle bands. (Pl. 40, Figs. 18 and 19.)\r\n\r\nIn the process of division, the continual formation of new valves, enclosed\r\nin the older girdle bands, will naturally cause a reduction in the size of\r\nthe frustule. While this reduction, owing to the elasticity of the girdle,\r\ndoes not always occur, I believe, yet, in most cases, the diameter is so\r\nreduced that a rejuvenescence of growth is required. This is caused by the\r\nproduction of auxospores which may appear without conjugation. In this\r\nprocess, the beginning of which, in certain species, may be noticed by the\r\nincrease in the size of the girdle as in reduplication, the two valves\r\nseparate and within is formed a more or less spherical mass about twice the\r\nsize of the original frustule and which forms on its circumference two\r\nlarge and often shapeless valves. These valves form others which assume the\r\nappearance of the original valves, but larger, and proceed to grow in the\r\nusual way. The reduction in size of the frustule seldom proceeds further\r\nthan about half the size of the type form, so that, as a general rule, it\r\nmay be stated that diatoms are not often smaller than half the larger size.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe process of reproduction has been observed in many cases, but the\r\nconclusions reached are somewhat at variance with each other. The auxospore\r\nformation is simply a {11}method of rejuvenescence. When, however, the\r\nauxospores are thrown off from filamentous diatoms, it is probable that two\r\nmay conjugate, their contents dividing each into two daughter cells which\r\nunite into two zygospores. The usual method is the union of two frustules,\r\nwhich, throwing off the old valves, coalesce into a single mass of\r\nprotoplasm which produces an auxospore, sometimes called a sporangial\r\nfrustule. It is stated that in some cases two frustules coalesce and\r\nproduce two auxospores.\r\n\r\nThe existence of spores in diatoms is a much-disputed point. While they\r\nhave never been seen, the inference that they exist is very great, as\r\notherwise it becomes difficult to understand the sudden growth of species\r\nin localities and under conditions that seem to preclude the actual\r\npresence of the living frustule. It is a matter of common observation that,\r\nin examining collections of living forms, minute frustules or brownish\r\nglobules appear to resemble larger diatoms. In gatherings of Gomphonema,\r\nwhen many specimens are sessile on the same object, numerous intermediate\r\nsizes, varying from minute globules to the type, are seen, yet not\r\npositively demonstrable as the same.\r\n\r\nConjugation, the formation of auxospores, and the actual process of cell\r\ndivision are seldom seen, as they occur during the night or at least in\r\ndarkness. It is advisable in order to observe reduplication to obtain the\r\nmaterial about midnight and place it in very dilute alcohol. In filamentous\r\nforms, however, the cell division is easily observed at any time in its\r\nvarious stages. By immersing in picric acid (saturated solution),\r\ntransferring to very dilute alcohol which is gradually increased in\r\nstrength, and then passing through oil of cloves and finally to the\r\nmounting medium, excellent preparations can be made. By staining with gold\r\nchloride alone the nucleus is made apparent without further treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF FORMS\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed that diatoms originated in the sea; to deny this requires\r\nevidence of the existence of fresh-water species previous to the Miocene\r\nperiod which is entirely marine. In those subject to fluctuations of the\r\nwaves, as pelagic diatoms, their existence appears to be contingent upon\r\nthe methods by which the separate frustules can cohere. Various devices,\r\nincluding hooks, spiral bundles, horns and processes exuding threads of\r\nplasma, exist for holding together the frustules. When marine forms are\r\nfound in quiet waters some of these devices, being no longer of any value,\r\ncease to grow, although free swimming diatoms are rare. They either occur\r\nin long chains or are stipitate or sessile. If it is further assumed that\r\nthe fresh-water diatoms are found in greater abundance in later periods,\r\nthe action of running streams makes necessary the provision of some means\r\nby which the species may continue to colonize. This may be recognized in\r\nthe occurrence of linear forms chiefly in streams. Circular forms, such as\r\nCyclotella which have no raphe, are found in quiet waters, such as pools or\r\nditches, and never exist living in running streams. Those forms only would\r\nbe able to live in water having a more or less swift current under one of\r\nthree conditions: they must, as in Gomphonema, be adherent to surrounding\r\nobjects by a stipe; or be enclosed in a gelatinous tube, as in\r\nHomoeocladia; or have an independent motion powerful enough to overcome the\r\ninfluence of the current. It is true that many forms with a raphe have no\r\napparent motion. In the case of Mastogloia provision is made in a\r\ngelatinous cushion in which the frustules are preserved. In Cocconeis, with\r\na true raphe in one valve only, in Epithemia, with a partial raphe, or in\r\ncertain Eunotiæ with a trace of one, we find species evidently degenerate\r\nand parasitic. The long Synedræ, having only a median line, live in running\r\nstreams, since they are attached at one end to other algae. Forms with a\r\ntrue raphe appear to be more highly developed, since they are able to seek\r\nlocations favorable to growth. Given, therefore, the structure of the\r\nvalve, the habitat may be inferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n{12}THE MOTION OF DIATOMS\r\n\r\nThe erratic backward and forward movement of certain diatoms, especially\r\nthose of the Naviculoid group, or the slow, rolling motion of Surirella,\r\nhas been discussed in so many ways without definite conclusions that a\r\nbrief statement will be sufficient. Osmosis, the amoeboid movement of the\r\ncoleoderm, the protrusion of protoplasm or protoplasmic threads through the\r\nraphe, the existence of actual organs of locomotion or cilia, and the lack\r\nof synchronism in the chemical action occurring at the ends of the cell\r\nwhich is sometimes divided by the plasma bridge, have been offered in\r\nexplanation. The chief objection to the theory of cyclosis appears to be\r\nthat the resultant motion is so greatly in excess of the rotation of\r\nprotoplasm in the cell. More or less motion is observed in various kinds of\r\nfree cells, but the movement of diatoms is not evident in those without\r\neither a raphe or a keel upon which and apparently by which the phenomena\r\nare produced.\r\n\r\nMr. T. Chalkley Palmer, in various articles in the Proceedings of the\r\nDelaware County Institute of Science, especially in Vols. 1 and 3, gives\r\nthe results of exhaustive experiments. \"Nothing, it would seem,\" he says,\r\n\"could be more conclusive as to the essential sameness of the nature of\r\nmotion in monads and diatoms, than the fact that both monads and diatoms\r\nrequire oxygen in order to perform motion, that they come to rest when\r\noxygen becomes scarce, and that they resume their motion when oxygen is\r\nagain supplied.\"\r\n\r\nHe also thinks \"that the living substance of the cell, more or less deeply\r\noverlaid with coleoderm substance of varying consistency, and itself\r\nassuming that degree of fluidity which best meets the requirements of the\r\nsituation, permeates the raphes, circulates in the keels, or in some cases\r\nprotrudes quite beyond the silica, and functions as the actual propulsive\r\nagent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUNCTION OF DIATOMS\r\n\r\nOf all forms of vegetation, the Diatomaceæ are, perhaps, the most\r\nubiquitous. Where-ever a sufficient amount of moisture, heat and light are\r\nfound, they grow. It was during the Miocene period that they first\r\nappeared, and, as marine forms, reached their greatest development, both as\r\nto size and beauty of marking, while their prevalence throughout the world\r\nin enormous quantities has been often mentioned. The Miocene beds of\r\nRichmond and Maryland continued over the Cretaceous formations of New\r\nJersey have outcropped in certain localities within our district, but are\r\nnot considered in this discussion.\r\n\r\nThe function of diatoms is not essentially different from that of other\r\nalgæ in providing food for aquatic animals, such as Salpæ and oysters, but\r\nit is, however, in other respects that they are not only important but\r\nnecessary factors in the preservation of life.\r\n\r\n \"Full nature swarms with life; one wondrous mass\r\n  Of animals, or atoms organized,\r\n  Waiting the vital breath, when parent heaven\r\n  Shall bid his spirit blow. The hoary fen,\r\n  In putrid streams, emits the living cloud\r\n  Of pestilence. Thro' subterranean cells\r\n  Where searching sunbeams scarce can find a way,\r\n  Earth animated heaves.\"\r\n\r\nI am not certain if Thomson fully understood the matter, but he has\r\nremarkably described the facts. When \"the vital breath\" of returning spring\r\nanimates the earth, the \"subterranean cells\" of diatoms, the \"atoms\r\norganized,\" through the liberation of vast quantities of oxygen,\r\nimmediately begin the purification of the \"putrid streams.\" Were these\r\nstreams not so purified, the accumulation of animal and vegetable débris\r\nwould eventually cause an enormous bacterial growth fatal to animal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{13}DIATOMACEÆ\r\n\r\n\r\nUnicellular or filamentous. Cells either free, sessile, united in\r\nfilaments, immersed in a gelatinous envelope or in fronds composed of\r\nbranching tubes; microscopic, enclosed in a more or less siliceous envelope\r\n(frustule), composed of two parts (valves), usually connected by an\r\nintervening band (zone or girdle). Cell contents include yellowish or\r\nbrownish chlorophyll-like bodies which occur in one or several bands\r\n(placcochromatic), or as variously distributed granular masses\r\n(coccochromatic) lining the inner walls. Growth by ordinary cell division\r\nor by auxospores; sexual multiplication by the formation of sporangia.\r\nValves of two kinds: (_a_) Those in which the markings or parts are more or\r\nless concentric (Centricæ); (_b_) Those (Pennatæ) in which the parts are\r\nmore or less symmetrically divided by a line (pseudoraphe) or by a cleft\r\n(raphe).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRICÆ\r\n\r\nValves without a dividing line or cleft; markings more or less radiate;\r\ntransverse section of frustule circular, polygonal, or elliptical,\r\nsometimes irregular.\r\n\r\nDivided into four groups:\r\n\r\n1. _Discoideæ._--Frustules (cells) discoid; valves without horns or\r\nelevations (sometimes with processes).\r\n\r\n2. _Solenoideæ._--Frustules with numerous girdle bands.\r\n\r\n3. _Biddulphioideæ._--Frustules box-like, _i. e._, with the longitudinal\r\naxis greater than in the Discoideæ. Valves with two or more angles,\r\nelevations or horns.\r\n\r\n4. _Rutilarioideæ._--Valves as if naviculoid, but with irregular or radial\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nGroups 2 and 4 are not included in our description. No. 2 contains plankton\r\ngenera only, while No. 4 consists of genera not yet found in this locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOIDEÆ\r\n\r\n1. _Coscinodisceæ._--Valve not divided by rays or costæ into sectors;\r\npuncta sometimes radiate; ocelli or processes absent.\r\n\r\n2. _Actinodisceæ._--Valve with radial striæ divided into sectors: ocelli\r\nand processes absent.\r\n\r\n3. _Eupodisceæ._--Valve disc-shaped with mammiform processes or one or more\r\nocelli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. COSCINODISCEÆ\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Meloseirinæ._--Frustules short, in chains.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Coscinodiscinæ._--Frustules disc form, usually single, rarely in\r\nshort chains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) MELOSEIRINÆ\r\n\r\n1. _Meloseira._--Valve punctate, with a constriction or furrow between edge\r\nof valve and girdle.\r\n\r\n2. _Gaillonella._--Valve punctate, with a circular collar or crest near\r\nedge of valve.\r\n\r\n3. _Lysigonium._--Valve punctate, neither keeled nor constricted.\r\n\r\n4. _Hyalodiscus._--Valve punctate in the centre; border with decussating\r\nradial lines.\r\n\r\n5. _Stephanopyxis._--Border of valve with a crown of thorns; valve\r\nareolate.\r\n\r\n6. _Pyxidicula._--Valve areolate, with a border of spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n{14}MELOSEIRA AG. (1824), em. DE TONI (1892)\r\n\r\n(melos, a limb or member, and seira, a chain)\r\n\r\nFrustules globose, ellipsoidal or cylindrical, concatenate, closely joined\r\ntogether. Valve either simply punctate or punctate and areolate. A\r\nconstriction of the cell-wall, forming a furrow between the edge of the\r\nvalve and the girdle, is more or less evident.\r\n\r\nThe genus Meloseira constituted by Agardh has been variously modified by\r\nKuetzing, Thwaites, Wm. Smith, Van Heurck, De Toni, and others. In Systema\r\nAlgarum Agardh included certain species of Conferva, of Lyngbye, Dillwyn\r\nand others, and limited his genus to frustules more or less globose (fila\r\narticulata ad genicula constricta), although in his Conspectus Criticus (p.\r\n64), he modifies the description (fila teretia articulata, articulis\r\ndiametro æqualibus vel longioribus) to include M. varians. As, however,\r\nLysigonium Link, Gaillonella Bory, and other genera enlarged by Ehrenberg\r\nand Kuetzing, came to be included under Meloseira, Thwaites suggested the\r\ndivision of the genus into two: Orthosira, in which the frustules are not\r\nconvex at the ends and Aulacosira in which no central line is apparent but\r\nwith two distinct sulci. Wm. Smith adopts the genus Orthosira but rejects\r\nAulacosira, including all forms under the former genus and Meloseira,\r\nsuggesting that differences \"exist in the formation of the sporangia\" of\r\nthe two genera. M. varians and M. crenulata appear to form auxospores or\r\nsporangial frustules in different ways, as will be noticed hereafter.\r\n\r\nAs, however, the present state of our knowledge is so limited and as much\r\nconfusion would result in further changing the nomenclature, I shall adopt,\r\nfor the most part, the division made by De Toni, separating Gaillonella and\r\nLysigonium and employing the name Meloseira as emendated in Sylloge\r\nAlgarum, although, as stated, it omits the species of Agardh. That a\r\nfurther division may be necessary is indicated by the differences existing\r\nbetween the Orthosira forms and the others.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\n  Frustules cylindrical and lengthened:\r\n\r\n    Valves with two distinct furrows; granules small          distans\r\n\r\n    Valves with coarse granules                               granulata\r\n\r\n    Valves denticulate on the margin                          crenulata\r\n\r\n    Valves denticulate and constricted                        roeseana\r\n\r\n    Valves with row of large puncta on the girdle side        undulata\r\n\r\n  Frustules cylindrical and compressed:\r\n\r\n    Valves punctate and areolate                              sulcata\r\n\r\nThe chromatophores consist of circular and compressed or irregular flat\r\ngranules which lie along the wall of the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELOSEIRA DISTANS (EHR.)

Smith doubts this, but is unable to offer any explanation. In the\r\npresent form the mode of reduplication is that usually found in filamentous\r\nforms, but in this case the presence of perfect frustules enclosing others\r\nin the process of still further division has been heretofore unfamiliar to\r\nme. The swelling in the middle appears to indicate that not all filamentous\r\ndiatoms are reduced in size by subdivision. In outline the valve is like\r\nthat of a \"truncated cone,\" as described by Petit in referring to\r\nGaillonella granulata var. bambusina Petit (Diat.

The author is perfectly familiar with the location, having\r\nmade large collections there. The mistake in the name is due to the fact\r\nthat Prof. Bailey received material from Mr. Tuomey marked \"Bermuda\r\nHundred,\" which is located near Petersburg, Va. Attempts have been made to\r\nfind material there and while there is an earth containing Miocene diatoms\r\nat Petersburg, it does not exactly correspond to the material sent to\r\nEhrenberg by Bailey, who was in doubt as to the locality. The Bermuda\r\nIslands are of coral formation and have no deposits of diatomaceous earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n{19}PYXIDICULA EHR.

In fact, it differs from Stephanopyxis, which is also sometimes\r\npunctate, only in the absence of spines. In fossil deposits the absence of\r\nan easily detached stratum is not significant. The difference, except in\r\nsize, between it and _P. mediterranea_ Grun. (V. H.

It more nearly coincides in\r\nstructure and development with other algæ not diatomaceous, the siliceous\r\nenvelope constituting its most distinctive feature.

Fr. Jos. Land,\r\nPl. 3 (C), Fig. 25). The apiculi are more numerous, but there appears to be\r\nlittle doubt of the general similarity. The Philadelphia form is abundant\r\nin the Pensauken well deposit at a depth of 33 ft. The apiculi become quite\r\ndistinct in slides stained with silver nitrate by Mr. F. J. Keeley; they\r\nare distinct from small apiculi sometimes evident between the fasciculi.\r\nThe specimens in the Pensauken deposit are mingled with other forms which\r\ncannot be distinguished from _C. subtilis_. Whether the two are identical,\r\nI am unable to determine. Rattray (Rev. Cos., p. 47) refers to H. L.\r\nSmith's Type Slide No. 100, from rice-field mud, Savannah, Ga., as _C.\r\nsubtilis_. In Smith's slide, in my possession, a number of the forms show\r\nfaint outlines of the large apiculi and are otherwise exactly like C.\r\npolyacanthus.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIATI\r\n\r\nCOSCINODISCUS VELATUS EHR.\r\n\r\nMarkings angular, decreasing slightly toward the coarsely striated border,\r\ncovered with fine puncta.\r\n\r\nBlue clay.\r\n\r\nPl. 3, Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSCINODISCUS MARGINATUS EHR.\r\n\r\nMarkings rounded, large, decreasing toward the broad border, which is\r\ncoarsely marked with distant striæ.

In each of\r\nthese beds a small form of A. heliopelta is rarely found.

SCHMIDT\r\n\r\nFrustule in zone view elliptical. Valve circular, 125-190 µ in diam.,\r\nclosely covered with two kinds of markings, one, a mesh of large,\r\nradiating, angular cells, the outer plate, and the other, radiating rows of\r\ncircular granules with hyaline spaces intervening and closer near the\r\nborder, forming the inner plate which can occasionally be seen detached.\r\nCentral space absent. The walls of the angular cells are crossed with fine\r\nlines and are probably composed of granules compressed so closely as to\r\nproduce partial opacity, the depth of which depends in a measure not only\r\non the superposition of the two plates, but on the relative closeness and\r\nthickness of the cell-walls. In a fully-developed specimen the effect is to\r\nproduce more or less triangular cells containing three or four granules. In\r\nsome cases the opacity is so great as to render detail invisible.\r\n\r\nIn the figure the valve is supposed to be divided into three sectors,\r\nillustrating at \"a\" the lower plate, at \"c\" the combination of the upper\r\nand lower plates, and in the other sector the cellular mesh of the upper\r\nplate. Processes, usually three, quite robust and inserted at from\r\none-fourth to one-fifth the length of the radius from the border which is\r\nstriated on the inner side.

Markings round with central dots distinct,\r\nabout 7 at the centre, decreasing in straight radial rows to 12 in 10 µ at\r\nthe border, where they form moniliform striæ. Border narrow with striæ\r\nabout 16 in 10 µ. Hyaline interspaces at the origin of the shorter rows,\r\nbut not at equal intervals. At the border, linear hyaline spaces occur at\r\nsomewhat irregular intervals between the moniliform striæ owing to the\r\ntermination of certain radial rows before they reach the circumference.\r\nNodule small, from one-seventh to one-fourth the radius from the border.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rattray the distinction between A. ralfsii and A. barkleyi is\r\npartly in the absence of the zone arrangement of the hyaline spaces in the\r\nlatter, and to the slight differences in the number of granules. The\r\nvariety aggregata differs from the type form of barkleyi mainly in the\r\ndistance of the nodule from the border. I have specimens from the blue clay\r\nmaterial at Walnut St. Bridge, and from Smith's Island, in which the\r\ndistance from the border in one case is, as stated above, quite different\r\nfrom that in the other.

About eighty species are\r\ndescribed, but as many of the forms are fossil, occuring in the Miocene of\r\nCalifornia, Oamaru and elsewhere, and as so few species are found in this\r\nlocality, I shall refer but briefly to this division.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Striolati._--No transverse median areas, striæ\r\n    inconspicuous                                             punctatus\r\n\r\n  _Lineolati._--Markings distinct, pruinose, interrupted      pruinosus\r\n\r\n  _Costati._--Transverse median areas usually distinct,       sculptus\r\n     markings continuous, costate                             cælatus\r\n\r\nAULISCUS PUNCTATUS BAIL.\r\n\r\nValve broadly elliptical, or suborbicular, covered with delicate\r\ninterrupted striæ radiating in sinuous lines to the circumference, more\r\nevident on the transverse median area; puncta 3 in 10 µ, grouped into a\r\nrounded area on each side of the median line, elsewhere scattered.

Central space rounded or irregular.\r\nProcesses circular.\r\n\r\nA. sculptus has coarser costæ and the interspaces are hyaline, or\r\napparently so, while in A. cælatus the punctate striæ between the costæ are\r\nmore evident.\r\n\r\nBlue clay. Not uncommon.\r\n\r\nPl. 5, Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nFig. 7 is a small, indefinite form intermediate between A. sculptus and A.\r\ncælatus.

The outer zone with\r\nsmaller apiculi surrounding the inner zone and with intermingled rows of\r\nfine puncta and interrupted diverging striæ. Near each end of the minor\r\naxis is a rather long, robust spine inserted at one-fourth the radius from\r\nthe border which is narrow and striated.

The form is regarded\r\nas but slightly siliceous and, therefore, the zone or girdle not being\r\nfound in the fossil deposits, I am unable to illustrate it from material in\r\nthe vicinity. On Plate 38, Figs. 6 and 7, I have sketched the zone and\r\nvalve views of specimens found recently at Vera Cruz and labelled by H. L.\r\nSmith Triceratum intricatum West. I can find no difference between the\r\nrecent and fossil forms of the valves. The zone is covered with fine puncta\r\nin quincunx, not visible under ordinary illumination.\r\n\r\nThe form as figured in Plate 6 corresponds to the figure of Lithodesmium\r\nundulatum Ehr. in Van Heurck, and West, in describing the Triceratium\r\nundulatum Wm. Sm. (figured as T. striolatum), thought that his T.\r\nintricatum was distinct from Ehrenberg's form on the ground that the latter\r\ncame from the \"Bermuda\" (Nottingham) earth and must be strongly siliceous.\r\nLithodesmium is characterized by the envelopment of the frustules by a\r\ncellular membrane which does not appear, evidently, in Ditylum. D.\r\nbrightwellii is distinguished by its crown of spines on the margin;\r\notherwise it closely resembles D. intricatum.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRINACRIA HEIB.

The two kinds\r\nof frustules are usually found growing together and as the variation is\r\noften extremely slight they are here included under the earlier name.\r\n\r\nPl. 10, Figs. 1, 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents the constricted form which is the more common. Fig. 3 is\r\na sporangial form.\r\n\r\nThe sporangial frustules vary in shape and size, some being long and\r\nslender, others clavate, but they are all more or less tumid in the middle,\r\nwith costæ more indefinite than in perfect valves. All gradations occur,\r\none end becoming shorter until the valve has the shape of the variety known\r\nas constrictum. It would seem, therefore, that the non-constricted form is\r\na passage from the sporangial to the smaller or adult form, or is of no\r\nspecific importance. All forms are found living together. The adult\r\nfrustules are the smaller ones; it is from them that the sporangia are\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nMeridion intermedium H. L. Smith (Amer. Quart. Mic. Jour., Vol. 1, p. 12)\r\nis characterized by less evident costæ and is more delicate in general\r\nappearance. Some forms are capitate and others are not. Prof. Smith\r\ncompares the M. intermedium with Peronia erinacea Bréb. and Arnott which he\r\nhas named M. erinaceum, hitherto found only in Europe, and points out the\r\nrelation of the two forms to Licmophora. An examination of the H. L. S.\r\ntype slides of the two diatoms proves that Peronia has very delicate costæ\r\nand a distinct pseudoraphe not noticeable in Meridion. On the slide of\r\nPeronia are frustules exactly similar to certain of the sporangial\r\nvariations of M. circulare.\r\n\r\nThe fan-like arrangement of Licmophora, the marine form, and the circular\r\nchains of Meridion, the fresh-water genus, are similar. Both are stipitate\r\nat the beginning of their growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) FRAGILARIEÆ\r\n\r\nDivided into three sections:\r\n\r\n_Diatominæ._--Valve circular, elliptical to linear, quadrate or cruciform,\r\nwith transverse costæ; without raphe, a pseudoraphe sometimes wanting.\r\n\r\n_Fragilariinæ._--Valve elongate, with small central and terminal\r\nelevations, without costæ but with transverse punctate striæ; without\r\ngenuine central nodule.\r\n\r\n_Eunotiinæ._--Valve lunate; a raphe sometimes partially formed with\r\nterminal nodules near the edges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIATOMINÆ\r\n\r\n_Diatoma._--Frustules in filaments.

If all of the species of Fragilaria proper have granular\r\nchromatophores, and all of Staurosira are placcochromatic, a satisfactory\r\ndivision can be made, but so long as these facts are not known in all\r\nspecies, and as authors have repeatedly confused the two divisions, the\r\nnomenclature will be uncertain. F. harrisonii is probably in any case to be\r\nseparated from the others. De Toni includes it under its original name of\r\nOdontidium, which genus he places near to Diatoma. The number of species in\r\nour locality is too limited to render further discussion of any value.\r\n\r\n\r\n{46}RHAPHONEIS EHR.

Valve elongate,\r\nlinear or linear-lanceolate; pseudoraphe distinct; costæ absent.\r\n\r\nThe genus Synedra has few distinctive characters. As Brun remarks (Diat.\r\ndes Alpes et du Jura, p. 122), the dilatation of the extremities and the\r\npseudo-nodule are of little value in classification, as the intermediate\r\nforms are so numerous. Fragilaria occurs in very long ribbons or fasciæ,\r\nSynedra in short fasciæ or radiating clusters. Fragilaria is seldom longer\r\nthan three or four times the width, while Synedra is nearly always so. The\r\nformer has fine, often subtle, markings and narrow pseudoraphe, while the\r\nlatter has coarser punctate striæ and a more distinct pseudoraphe.\r\n\r\nChromatophores usually consist of two bands, one on each of the valves.\r\nKarsten states that in the marine forms the chromatophores are oval or\r\npolygonal discs, each of which usually encloses a pyrenoid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNEDRA ULNA (NITZSCH) EHR.\r\n\r\nFrustules solitary or in twos.

On Plate 12, Fig. 8, I have drawn a specimen from H.\r\nL. Smith's Type Slide No. 574, labelled S. radians Kuetz., not Wm. Smith,\r\nwhich, however, corresponds closely to Smith's figure (Brit. Diat. 1, Pl.\r\n11, Fig. 89). De Toni gives S. radians Kuetz. as equivalent to S. tenera\r\nWm. Sm. Van Heurck's figure of S. radians, and also the figure of ulna\r\nvar., said to be synonymous with H. L. Smith's S. radians, which does not\r\ncorrespond to the specimens on Smith's slide in my possession, are\r\nconfusing. In Van Heurck's Synopsis the striæ are said to be 16 or 17,\r\nwhile De Toni describes them as subtle and from 17 to 24 in 10 µ. The\r\nlength is quite variable.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Synedra resemble S. radians in the mode of growth, as\r\nthey are adnate at first, in short bands, the frustules being sessile on\r\nother plants or objects, attached at the terminal nodules which, although\r\nscarcely visible in most forms, are probably present in all. The frustules\r\nare not closely connected at the free end, and soon become entirely\r\ndetached.\r\n\r\nIn Diatoma and Fragilaria, we find a punctum or pore at one end of a valve,\r\nbut not in line with the pseudoraphe; in Synedra, a minute pore is usually\r\nfound in the position of the terminal nodule and, in some species,\r\nindications of a central nodule are observed; the median line is wider but\r\nthere is no raphe. In the fresh-water Synedræ, many of which are among the\r\nlongest of diatoms, living in running streams, the terminal nodules are\r\nmuch more indistinct, while the marine forms have distinct terminal\r\nnodules, are not, as a rule, found in bands, and assume a more naviculoid\r\noutline.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNEDRA VAUCHERIÆ VAR.

(1862)\r\n\r\n(eu, well, and noton, a back, referring to the strong, ridged dorsum)\r\n\r\nFrustules free, in fasciæ or epiphytic. Valve arcuate, without costæ,\r\ntransversely striated; pseudoraphe absent; pseudo-nodules at each end.\r\n\r\nChromatophores laminate along the concave zone and the valves.\r\n\r\nVery many species of Eunotia have been created to differentiate size and\r\nnumber of crenæ or undulations. An examination of certain fossil deposits\r\nof New England, as well as a gathering from the blue clay of Philadelphia,\r\nwill show forms which vary infinitely. E. major and E. gracilis are\r\nscarcely distinguishable because of the intermediate variations. The striæ\r\nin all forms are punctate, but the puncta are frequently confluent.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF SPECIES\r\n\r\nEunotia is divided into two sections, Himantidium and Eunotia proper. In\r\nHimantidium, the frustules are in fasciæ, either short or long. Among those\r\nwith short fasciæ are major, gracilis, and nymanniana; those with long\r\nfasciæ are pectinalis, solierolii and veneris. Eunotia proper includes\r\nfrustules, free or epiphytic, in which the valves are not dentate on the\r\ndorsal margin, such as lunaris, hemicyclus, biceps and prærupta; and those\r\nin which the valves are dentate or crenate on the dorsum, such as monodon,\r\ntriodon, diadema and others.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between Eunotia and Epithemia is noticeable. In both, the\r\nepiphytic character of the valve is seen in the shape of the frustule which\r\nis arched, and, in the free forms, is adherent at the ends only. In\r\nEpithemia, the median is more evident than the terminal nodules. In\r\nEunotia, there is no median nodule, but the end nodules, in some species,\r\nare quite evident, and a tendency is shown to produce a very short raphe.\r\nThe arrangement of puncta in valve view is similar in both genera.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 1.

Exceedingly abundant in the cedar-swamp streams\r\nof the Pine Barren regions of New Jersey. In winter, the dead frustules\r\nform a parchment-like coating upon the twigs, dead leaves, and other débris\r\non the borders of streams.\r\n\r\nThis species can scarcely be referred to Dillwyn's Conferva pectinalis, as,\r\nin his description, quoting Mueller, he says that \"the filaments are of a\r\ndirty green color; seldom exceeding half an inch in length.\" Dillwyn's form\r\nis probably Fragilaria virescens, which equals Fragilaria pectinalis Ehr.,\r\nwhile Kuetzing's species is Fragilaria pectinalis Ralfs.

I have added\r\nthe genus Epithemia and also Rhopalodia, partly because they contain a\r\nraphe of a certain kind and partly because they resemble the markings of\r\ncertain of the genus Hantzschia in the following group, although in other\r\nrespects there is probably no similarity.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of combining the numerous genera into groups which are\r\nnaturally affiliated is avoided in the following arrangement based on\r\nsuperficial similarities, and is intended merely as an artificial key. To\r\nunite all forms having a raphe and which are symmetrical with valves\r\nsimilar and not sigmoid, under the one genus Navicula, as has been the\r\ncustom previous to the publication of Cleve's monograph, would result in\r\nassociating species differing in so many respects in relation to structure\r\nof the valve and cell contents that it seems advisable to retain the new\r\ngenera, especially as the original genus is likely to be still further\r\nreduced when more is known of the structure and life history of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY TO THE GENERA\r\n\r\n\r\n  Valves dissimilar.

In C. pediculus, a\r\nsingle chromatophore occurs on the inside of the upper valve. In\r\nconjugation, two cells open and secrete a gelatinous mass from which an\r\nauxospore is formed.\r\n\r\nCleve separates the forms having a loculiferous rim (Cocconeis) from those\r\nwithout a rim (Eucocconeis).

(1840)\r\n\r\n(amphora, a jar)\r\n\r\nValves asymmetrical along the longitudinal axis, as in Cymbella, but with\r\nthe plane passing through the dorsal and ventral sides of one valve at an\r\nangle with that of the other. As Cleve states, Cymbella and Amphora are\r\nforms of Navicula \"with both valves similar and asymmetrical along the\r\nlongitudinal axis,\" and the difference between Cymbella and Amphora is in\r\nthe \"degree of asymmetry.\" If, following H. L. Smith's diagrams (Lens, Vol.\r\n2, 1873, p. 66), we assume that the usual form of the valve in Navicula is\r\nelliptical or lanceolate, and the zone view is rectangular, we have in\r\nCymbella an arcuate median line and a more or less reniform valve, while\r\nthe zone view remains rectangular with the valves parallel. Now, if the\r\nvalves are asymmetrical along the longitudinal axis, and one side of one\r\nvalve is separated from the corresponding side of the opposite valve by a\r\nwider connective zone than is the case on the other side, the transverse\r\nsection of the frustule will appear cuneate, as in Amphora, and the\r\nconnective zone will be wider on one side than the other. When, therefore,\r\nwe examine an entire frustule as it is usually seen, we shall find the two\r\nraphes of the valves in focus at the same time on the ventral side, and, by\r\nchanging the focus, the convex sides of the same valves are seen, the\r\ndorsal view with, usually, a wider connective zone. As an illustration,\r\ncompare Figs. 5 and 6, on Plate 15, Fig. 6 being the ventral, and Fig. 5\r\nthe dorsal view.\r\n\r\nAs Amphoræ are epiphytic or parasitic, they are considered, as Cleve\r\nremarks, like Achnanthes and Cocconeis, as \"degenerated forms.\"\r\n\r\nChromatophores usually single, lying on the ventral connective zone.\r\nMereschkowsky describes nine forms.\r\n\r\nCleve divides the genus into a number of groups as follows:\r\n\r\n_Amphora proper._--Connective zone not complex; valves with longitudinal\r\nlines on the dorsal side; coarsely punctate or costate.\r\n\r\n_Diplamphora._--Zone complex; otherwise as in Amphora.\r\n\r\n_Halamphora._--Longitudinal lines absent; frustule elongate, with\r\nprotracted ends.\r\n\r\n{65}_Oxyamphora._--Zone complex; longitudinal lines absent; frustule\r\nelliptical; valve lunate, with or without a central stauros; striæ\r\npunctate.\r\n\r\n_Amblyamphora._--Zone complex; frustule rectangular; valve lunate; striæ\r\npunctate; axial and central areas indistinct.\r\n\r\n_Psammamphora._--Zone not complex; frustule rectangular; central nodule\r\nfrequently dilated to a stauros; no axial or central area.\r\n\r\n_Cymbamphora._--Valve semi-lanceolate; median line straight, approximate to\r\nthe ventral margin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHORA\r\n\r\nAMPHORA ROBUSTA GREG.\r\n\r\nFrustule elliptical, truncate; valve lunate, with straight ventral margin;\r\nmedian line biarcuate; ventral side with coarse, radiate striæ, 6 in 10 µ,\r\non both sides of the median line.\r\n\r\nAlong the coast.\r\n\r\nPl. 15, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHORA PROTEUS GREG.\r\n\r\nFrustule elliptical, truncate; valve lunate, with straight ventral margin;\r\nmedian line biarcuate; no central area.

The two valves of the other mother cell are not shown as they\r\nare not usually found closely united. In the figure one valve alone of the\r\nauxospore is seen, the opposite valve not being in focus. The valves of the\r\nauxospore are usually more or less arcuate, as in Cymbella, to which the\r\ngenus is closely allied.\r\n\r\nGrunow divides Gomphonema into two groups, Asymmetricæ and Symmetricæ,\r\naccording to the presence or absence of stigmas. Cleve suggests Stigmaticæ\r\nand Astigmaticæ as more suitable in order to agree with the Cymbellæ. The\r\nStigmaticæ are found chiefly in fresh water, sometimes in brackish. All of\r\nthe marine forms belong to the Astigmaticæ, which, however, include some\r\ncommon fresh-water forms. Many species of Gomphonema are stipitate, some\r\noccur in gelatinous masses, and others are free.\r\n\r\n\r\n{71}GOMPHONEMA MONTANUM SCHUM.\r\n\r\nValve slightly biconstricted, with obtuse apex and basis, somewhat cuneate;\r\naxial area linear, widened in the middle unilaterally; stigma, one; striæ\r\nabout 11 in 10 µ, more distant in the middle, punctate.\r\n\r\n_Gomphonema subclavatum_ var. _montana_ (Schum.)

Pleurosigma includes all forms having oblique\r\nrows of puncta, while Gyrosigma includes all having longitudinal rows. Both\r\nhave transverse striæ. The former consists entirely of marine species,\r\nwhile in the latter the species are found in fresh, brackish and salt\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe endochrome in Pleurosigma, according to Mueller, consists of two bands\r\nwhich differ in the median part of each valve. Mereschkowsky says that the\r\nendochrome is so divided as to form four bands, two on each valve, that\r\ntheir position is different in different species, and that they are not the\r\nsame on valves of the same frustule.\r\n\r\nCleve prefers to classify the species of Pleurosigma and Gyrosigma in\r\naccordance with the outline of the valve and the flexure of the median\r\nline.

Sometimes, however, as in N. hennedyi, N. lyra and N. humerosa, the\r\nbands are on the valves. Certain species have four bands, others eight, and\r\nin one the endochrome is granular. (Mereschkowsky, l. c., p. 9 et seq.)\r\nPyrenoids are usually absent. On account of the diversity of the\r\nchromatophores, Mereschkowsky considers the genus not homogeneous. The\r\ndifficulty of arranging groups according to the cell contents, however, is\r\nso great that, for the present, the species must be described by the usual\r\ncharacteristics of the valves and divided as follows, according to Cleve,\r\nto the extent of employing the classification of all Naviculoid forms as\r\napplicable, especially to the species of Navicula. Van Heurck's analysis\r\nincludes Pinnularia, Trachyneis, Diploneis, Caloneis, Neidium and\r\nAnomoeoneis, which are here separated, while N. lyra and N. hennedyi are\r\nplaced in different groups, although they are closely related. In other\r\nrespects Cleve's divisions correspond, to some extent, to those of Van\r\nHeurck.\r\n\r\nThe genus Navicula at one time included the following: Dictyoneis,\r\nPleurosigma, Gyrosigma, Caloneis, Neidium, Diploneis, Frustulia,\r\nTrachyneis, Anomoeoneis, Pinnularia and Stauroneis, and few forms with a\r\nraphe escaped. For this reason the diagnosis of the present genus is\r\nsomewhat limited. Pleurosigma and Gyrosigma differ from Navicula in their\r\noutline, Dictyoneis in the double stratification, Caloneis in the marginal\r\nlines, Neidium in the median and terminal fissures, Diploneis in the horns,\r\nFrustulia in the terminal nodules, Trachyneis in the stratification of the\r\nvalve, Anomoeoneis in the longitudinal arrangement of the puncta,\r\nPinnularia in the smooth costæ and Stauroneis in the stauros.\r\n\r\nAs the object of the present work is to aid the student of local forms in\r\nthe identification of species by the briefest methods, the further\r\ndiscussion of the reasons for classification will be left for his\r\ngratification in referring to the authorities on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNCTATÆ CLEVE\r\n\r\nValve elliptical to lanceolate; central nodule not stauroid or continued\r\ninto lyriform spaces; striæ distinctly or coarsely punctate, in radiate\r\nrows.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVICULA MACULATA (BAIL.)

(1843)\r\n\r\n(pinnula, a small feather)\r\n\r\nValve linear or nearly so, with rounded ends; axial area broad; central and\r\nterminal areas large; costæ smooth, transverse or radiating, usually\r\nconvergent at the ends.\r\n\r\nThe costæ are channels on the inside of the valve, closed, except in the\r\nmiddle where elliptical foramina, opening into the interior of the valve,\r\ngive rise through their terminal margins to the two longitudinal lines on\r\neach side of the valve. The raphe begins as a groove in the side of the\r\nconical central nodule and continues as a cleft at right angles to the\r\nplane of the surface of the valve, in which case the raphe forms a single\r\nline; if the raphe is inclined to the valve surface, then two lines appear\r\nin projection, the upper and lower edges of the cleft. In some forms the\r\nsurface of the edge of the raphe on one side is folded or grooved for a\r\nconsiderable distance, and the opposite edge is elevated into a ridge or\r\n{102}tongue fitting into the groove. In such cases it is possible, in\r\nprojection, to see the upper or outer edges of the raphe, the lower edges\r\nand the edges of the tongue and groove, thus showing four lines; sometimes,\r\nwhen the tongue and groove do not meet, six lines. The so-called inner\r\nchannel is the part of the raphe on the inside of the tongue, and the\r\nso-called exterior channel is the part of the raphe on the outside of the\r\ntongue. If, in addition to this formation of the raphe, the plane of\r\ncleavage changes toward the terminal nodules, the lines will cross each\r\nother and, when two are superimposed, disappear altogether. For the careful\r\nexamination of the raphe it is necessary to employ large forms, and it is\r\nadvisable to use nitrate of silver which remains in the raphe, and, as in\r\nslides mounted by Mr. F. J. Keeley, shows in a beautiful manner the entire\r\noutline of raphe and fissures. The terminal fissures owe their separation\r\nto the different directions taken by the two edges of the raphe on each\r\nside, one edge bending in a wide curve toward the end of the valve, showing\r\ntwo lines, the upper and lower edges of one side of the raphe when inclined\r\nto the plane of the surface, and the other edge of the raphe turning\r\nsuddenly in an opposite direction and ending abruptly in a curve, giving\r\nrise to the appearance, by diffraction, of a punctum.\r\n\r\nPl. 40, Figs. 13, 14 and 15.\r\n\r\nEndochrome consists of two chromatophores lying on the zones.\r\n\r\nPinnularia is usually divided into the Majores, or larger, and the Minores,\r\nor smaller forms, the latter being further divided according to their\r\nstriæ.

The form of P.\r\ngibba here figured, which may be P. stauroptera, is not the typical form of\r\nWm. Smith, which has a narrow area and central space. There are, however,\r\namong the typical specimens in H. L. Smith's Type Slide No. 275, smaller\r\nvalves which show a resemblance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINÆ\r\n\r\nPINNULARIA RECTANGULATA (GREG.)

Central and terminal nodules not easily seen; in\r\nsome species a true raphe is indicated.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between Epithemia and Eunotia has been already mentioned.\r\nIn the shape and striation of the valves there is an approach to Cymbella.\r\n\r\nThe genus is divided into two groups, one in which the costæ alternate with\r\ndouble rows of puncta, as in E. turgida, and the other in which the rows of\r\npuncta are more than two.\r\n\r\nThe endochrome usually consists of a band lying along the ventral zone and\r\nextending in two flaps on the valves.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITHEMIA TURGIDA (EHR.)

Valve reniform or lunate; a raphe, not visible in some species in\r\nthe usual position of the valve, is found along the convex edge or keel.\r\nMedian and terminal nodules, although very small, can be determined. The\r\nname is more appropriate to the African species which are clavate. Two\r\nspecies only are found in this locality.\r\n\r\nThe chief distinction between Epithemia and Rhopalodia is in the position\r\nof the raphe and the nodules.

The genus\r\nNitzschia also has a keel, but it does not border each side of the valve as\r\nin Surirella, being found either near one margin or between it and the\r\ncentre. Certain of the Surirellæ are allied to the group Tryblionella of\r\nthe Nitzschiæ, while forms of Stenopterobia are distinguished with\r\ndifficulty from the group Sigmata.\r\n\r\nThe following arrangement, therefore, is intended to include all genera\r\nhaving a keel or something which resembles it.\r\n\r\n_Hantzschia._--Valve asymmetrical; keels of the two valves opposite each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n_Nitzschia._--Valve asymmetrical; keels not (usually) opposite each other.\r\n\r\n_Surirella._--Valve usually symmetrical; a keel on each border.\r\n\r\n_Cymatopleura._--Valve without an elevated keel, but with markings like\r\nthose of Surirella; undulated in zone view.\r\n\r\n_Campylodiscus._--Valves saddle-shaped.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANTZSCHIA GRUN.

Nitzsch, of Halle)\r\n\r\nFrustules usually free, sometimes enclosed in tubes or united into a\r\nfilament. Valves keeled, the keels of the two valves usually diagonally\r\nopposite (see Hantzschia); keel puncta short or prolonged.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mereschkowsky, there are at least two endochrome plates placed\r\ntransversely on the zones; sometimes there are from four to six plates, in\r\none species twenty granules and in another no trace of any endochrome\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis is that of Grunow as given in Cleve and Grunow's\r\n\"Arctic Diatoms,\" and adopted and illustrated by Van Heurck in his\r\n\"Synopsis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUPS\r\n\r\n1. _Tryblionella._--Keel very excentric, valve often folded; keel puncta\r\nindistinct, usually the same in number as the striæ.\r\n\r\n2. _Panduriformes._--Valve broad, constricted in the middle, with more or\r\nless evident fold; keel very near the edge; keel puncta quite evident or\r\napparently wanting.\r\n\r\n{115}3. _Apiculatæ._--Keel very near the edge; valve linear or somewhat\r\nnarrower in the middle; striæ on the longitudinal fold fainter than on the\r\nremaining surface, or wanting; puncta not in quincunx.\r\n\r\n4. _Pseudo-Tryblionella._--Keel more or less close to the edge; valve with\r\na more or less deep longitudinal fold over which the striæ are spread in\r\nthe same way as over the remaining surface; keel puncta always distinct.\r\n\r\n5. _Circumsutæ._--Valve with more or less wide longitudinal fold; keel very\r\nexcentric; keel puncta quite evident; surface of valve irregularly punctate\r\nand also traversed by rows of delicate puncta which belong to a different\r\nlayer of the valve.\r\n\r\n6. _Dubiæ._--Like the group Pseudo-Tryblionella, but the valves are not so\r\nmuch folded; frustules sometimes narrowed in the middle. The separation of\r\nspecies is difficult and, in part, doubtful. Keel excentric.\r\n\r\n7. _Bilobatæ._--Like the group Dubiæ, but with more central keel and so\r\nforming a transition to the group Pseudo-Amphiprora; valves without\r\nlongitudinal folds.\r\n\r\n8. _Pseudo-Amphiprora._--Valve with quite central, sharp keel, arcuate,\r\nwithout longitudinal fold; keel puncta always evident; frustule narrowed in\r\nthe middle with more or less marked central nodule.\r\n\r\nIncludes two species not found in this locality.\r\n\r\n9. _Perrya._--Valve arched with very sharp central keel; not narrowed in\r\nthe middle; keel puncta mostly on short or long lines which are sometimes\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIncludes six species not found in this locality.\r\n\r\n10. _Epithemioideæ._--Keel excentric; keel puncta extended into costæ\r\nacross the entire valve.\r\n\r\n11. _Grunowia._--As in the group Epithemioideæ, except that the costæ are\r\nshorter, not extending across the valve; keel very excentric.\r\n\r\n12. _Scalares._--Like Grunowia, but with sharper, somewhat excentric keel;\r\ntransverse section of frustule quadrangular.\r\n\r\n13. _Insignes._--Like Scalares, but with more central keel so that many of\r\nthe forms are near the group Perrya; frustule somewhat sigmoid.\r\n\r\n14. _Bacillaria._--Keel central or nearly so; valve somewhat arched; keel\r\nsharp, as in the group Insignes.\r\n\r\n15. _Vivaces._--Keel moderately excentric; valve, according to position,\r\nsemi-lanceolate, with keel puncta in short rows, or lanceolate with quite\r\ncentral keel. The valves have in many positions a resemblance to\r\nHantzschia, so that N. vivax frequently becomes confounded with a form of\r\nH. amphioxys. The median keel puncta are not distant and a central nodule\r\nis not evident as is the case in all species of Hantzschia.\r\n\r\n16. _Spathulatæ._--Like the group Bacillaria, but usually with very\r\ndelicate striated valves; keel in valve view usually bordered with two\r\nparallel lines.\r\n\r\n17. _Dissipatæ._--Like Vivaces and Spathulatæ, but with smaller central\r\nkeel and without parallel lines. Valves usually small, very delicately\r\nstriated; no central nodule.\r\n\r\n18. _Sigmoideæ._--Keel quite central; no parallel lines; frustule sigmoid;\r\nvalve without longitudinal furrow; keel puncta not extended; no central\r\nnodule evident.\r\n\r\n19. _Sigmata._--Like Sigmoideæ, but with a more excentric keel.\r\n\r\n20. _Obtusæ._--Like Sigmata, with a more or less excentric keel which has\r\nin the middle a small bending to the inside; middle keel puncta somewhat\r\nmore distant than the others, and between them a central nodule evident.\r\n\r\n{116}21. _Spectabiles._--Valve large, slightly arcuate, with excentric\r\nkeel; no longitudinal folds; keel puncta somewhat extended over the valve\r\nbut much less than in the group Insignes, and often scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\n22. _Lineares._--Keel somewhat excentric, but less than in Spectabiles;\r\nfrustule straight, sometimes a little constricted in the middle, so that a\r\ntransition is shown to the groups Dubiæ and Bilobatæ. Valve without\r\nlongitudinal fold; keel puncta round or somewhat angular, scarcely\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n23. _Lanceolatæ._--Valve lanceolate, linear-lanceolate or rarely\r\nelliptical, with very excentric keel; not folded; keel puncta not extended.\r\n\r\n24. _Nitzschiella._--Valve with excentric keel and long, produced apices.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRYBLIONELLA\r\n\r\nNITZSCHIA TRYBLIONELLA HANTZSCH\r\n\r\nValve elliptical-lanceolate, with subacute apices; longitudinal fold well\r\nmarked; striæ coarse, transverse, 5 in 10 µ; indistinct puncta intermediate\r\nbetween the striæ.

Two years later, Gmelin described\r\nthe same form as Bacillaria paradoxa, a name still used. Heiberg, however,\r\nin 1863, placed the form under Nitzschia where it properly belongs and\r\ncalled it Nitzschia paxillifer (O. F. Mueller). I have adopted Heiberg's\r\nname.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable of all diatoms. Many species possess the power\r\nof motion, which, however, is evident only in the free frustule. In N.\r\npaxillifer, the movement of the frustules occurs without the loss of\r\ncontinuity or adherence to each other, so that, while at one time the\r\nadnate frustules form a narrow filament, like that of Fragilaria, at\r\nanother {120}time they move laterally to their extreme length and form a\r\nthread of frustules adherent at their ends, later resuming their original\r\nposition. The motion is repeated at intervals of from five to ten seconds.\r\nNo satisfactory explanation of the movement has ever been made. In the\r\nfilamentous form the frustules adhere to water-plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIVACES\r\n\r\nNITZSCHIA FLUMINENSIS GRUN.\r\n\r\nValve lanceolate, apices produced; keel puncta, 4-6 in 10 µ, partly\r\nextended in short costæ; striæ transverse, 14-15 in 10 µ, punctate; keel\r\nwithout a pseudo-nodule.

The occurrence of the\r\nvariety in fresh water is another instance of the finding of presumably\r\nbrackish forms in the water supply of the city. If these cases prove to be\r\nunusual, it may be because of one of two reasons. The Schuylkill River,\r\nbefore the building of the dam at Fairmount, was tidal as far as the Falls\r\nof Schuylkill, and brackish influences, while not now existent, may have\r\ncaused the growth of forms which now survive. Another reason may be that\r\nthe opening of the locks at Fairmount Dam may cause a slight admission of\r\nbrackish forms from tidal water below.

For\r\nthe novice, however, the following methods, used by the author for many\r\nyears, may be of service.\r\n\r\n_Collection of Fresh-water Material._--The yellow film on the inside of\r\naquaria always contains small species. Stems of water-plants near the\r\nshores of ponds and the submerged roots, the brownish coating of rocks in\r\nstreams and water-falls, fountains, and water-troughs, are prolific. At all\r\ntimes of the year, some diatoms may be found in a thin layer upon the mud\r\nof rivers or creeks. In the spring, brown patches of mud, filled with\r\nbubbles, floating near the shore in ponds, or coming down with the current\r\nin rivers, are rich in various forms. Within the limits assigned to our\r\ndistrict, I have made collections in the following localities: Schuylkill\r\nRiver, including the region near Fairmount Dam, several reservoirs and the\r\nwater-supply; the Wissahickon and Fairmount Park, Darby, Crum and Ridley\r\nCreeks, the Neshaminy and the Brandywine; meadow pools and rivulets near\r\nthe city; the upper Delaware, the Water Gap and numerous cascades\r\nnorthward; the Shawangunk Mountains and the Poconos; many parts of New\r\nJersey along the coast; the Pine Barren region, the Hammonton, Atsion and\r\nKirkwood Ponds and the swamps near Atco.\r\n\r\nIn the collection of fresh-water material, it is well to be provided with a\r\nnumber of small bottles. Take a handful of the water-plants or algæ, and\r\nsqueeze the material into the bottles, or, lacking a bottle, wrap it in\r\npaper. With a small forceps it is possible to detach minute quantities of a\r\npure gathering which may not need further preparation beyond burning to a\r\nred heat on the cover-glass before mounting. A malacca cane, with extending\r\nrod to which may be screwed a bottle, net, spoon or hook, is useful on a\r\nlong trip. If it is impossible to separate the thin film of diatoms from\r\nthe mud in the bed of streams, dip up the surface mud with one bottle,\r\nallow to settle a few minutes, then pour off the supernatant liquid, which\r\nwill be comparatively free from sand, into another bottle. It must be\r\nconfessed, however, that the mud in streams near Philadelphia contains a\r\nlarge quantity of fine mica which, in some instances, it is impossible to\r\nremove.\r\n\r\n_Collection of Marine Material._--Shell scrapings, the stomachs of fish,\r\nmarine algæ, especially the brown and red algæ, the hulls of vessels, mud\r\nfrom anchors and dredgings, are all sources which may prove valuable. In\r\nthe sand ripples, after the tide recedes, a yellowish-brown deposit will be\r\nnoticed. This should be taken up carefully with a spoon and placed in a\r\nbottle; the sand will settle at once and a very pure gathering will be held\r\nin suspension in the water. Such collections may be made along the entire\r\ncoast of New Jersey on sunny days in summer. In salt meadows near Absecon\r\nand Hackensack, large quantities of diatoms, including Pleurosigma, may be\r\nobtained in the yellow scum floating on the surface.\r\n\r\n_The Blue Clay Deposit._--The blue clay occurs as a pre- or post-glacial\r\ndeposit in the bed of the ancient Delaware River, and, at depths varying\r\nusually from fifteen to forty feet below the surface, has been obtained\r\nfrom artesian wells at Pavonia, Pensauken and Gloucester, N. J., also at\r\nPort Penn on the Delaware, and especially from the dredgings {132}made by\r\nthe removal of Smith's Island opposite the city. In the city proper, it may\r\nbe stated briefly that material may be found in a stratum of very light\r\nblue clay at a depth varying from twenty to sixty feet in many places south\r\nof Arch St. east of Broad St., and also along the beds of ancient rivulets\r\nnear Tioga St., at Sixteenth St., and in certain other places which were\r\nprobably subject to tidal overflow. One of the best collections was made\r\nalong the bank of the Schuylkill at the east end of Walnut St. Bridge, at a\r\ndepth of thirteen feet below the surface. Excavations for the Reading\r\nTerminal and the Subway and several buildings, as the Bingham House, have\r\nfurnished numerous specimens.\r\n\r\n_Cleaning the Material._--Some gatherings may be so pure as to be ready for\r\nmounting when treated with dilute alcohol and oil of cloves. If, when\r\ngathered, the diatoms are immersed in a saturated solution of picric acid\r\nfor several days, they may be stained with carmine or methylene blue, or\r\nwhatever may be required to emphasize the contents of the frustules,\r\nincluding the endochrome and the pyrenoids. After staining, pass as rapidly\r\nas expedient through the treatment with dilute alcohol and oil of cloves,\r\nand mount in benzol balsam, avoiding heat. A hot solution of mercuric\r\nbichloride is sometimes used for the preservation of the endochrome,\r\nalthough washing is needed before mounting. For the particular stain\r\nconsidered best for certain details of structure, it will be advisable to\r\nconsult works on Micro-Chemistry or Heinzerling (_l. c._). The stains of\r\nmost importance are carmine, methylene blue, hæmatoxylin, gold chloride and\r\nBismarck brown.\r\n\r\nWhatever method may be used in staining, the identification of forms is\r\nimpossible, in most cases, unless the valves are carefully cleaned and the\r\ncell-contents destroyed. For this purpose provide a casserole holding from\r\nfive to eight ounces, an iron tripod stand with alcohol lamp, several\r\nsix-inch test-tubes, preferably those with a standard base, fitted with\r\npure rubber corks. Take the material as free from twigs, dead leaves, sand,\r\nand other matter as possible, place it in the casserole, and add about the\r\nsame quantity of nitric acid. Boil for twenty minutes and then add about\r\nhalf a teaspoonful of powdered bichromate of potash, stirring with a glass\r\nrod. Then take a beaker-glass partly filled with water and pour into it\r\nslowly the liquid which has been allowed to cool a short time, whirling the\r\ncasserole to cause the concentration of sand in the centre. Allow the\r\nmaterial to settle for half an hour or longer, according to the amount of\r\ndiatoms and their size. Pour off the water, add more water, and place in a\r\ntest-tube. Repeat the decantation, shaking the test-tube, closed with a\r\nrubber cork, vigorously each time. From time to time whirl the diatoms in\r\nthe casserole and throw away the sand collected in the centre. By repeating\r\nthe decantation, shaking and whirling, the deposit will be found to consist\r\nalmost entirely of diatoms. It may be necessary to repeat the boiling in\r\nthe acid and bichromate. If, however, any detritus other than sand is\r\nnoted, boil in sulphuric acid and add from time to time minute pinches of\r\npowdered chlorate of potash, being careful to protect the eyes by holding a\r\npiece of glass before them; otherwise the explosions which occur are likely\r\nto throw some of the boiling acid into the eyes and destroy the sight. The\r\nmaterial, when clean, should be white or, in the case of Synedra,\r\nyellowish. It is quite easy to construct a box fitted with the proper\r\napparatus for boiling and provided with a glass door for observation, and a\r\nmethod of introducing the chlorate of potash through a small aperture or\r\ntube. The box may be placed in the garden or fastened outside of a window\r\nso that the poisonous fumes may be carried off.\r\n\r\nAn excellent method, in the case of larger forms, is to boil the material\r\nalready cleaned by the acid in water to which a few shavings of coarse\r\nbrown soap are added. The difference in density will hold in suspension any\r\nflocculent matter, and while many of the smaller {133}forms will not\r\nsettle, the others will be perfectly cleaned. When satisfied with the\r\ncleaning, preserve the stock material in part alcohol and, in using, pour\r\ninto a smaller bottle the amount required, replace the dilute alcohol with\r\ndistilled water, and mount as directed. It often happens that gatherings\r\nare made consisting almost entirely of sand. Attempts at cleaning in the\r\nusual way will cause the loss of nearly all of the diatoms. In this case,\r\nafter the material has been treated with acid until nothing remains but\r\nsand and a few diatoms, the mechanical finger must be used.\r\n\r\nIn the cleaning of marine deposits, various methods may be required. In the\r\ncase of partly siliceous species, washing in pure water repeatedly is all\r\nthat can be done. The larger and heavier diatoms may be separated from the\r\nsand by elutriation or by whirling in a casserole, by rocking in a shallow\r\ndish the shape of a watch crystal, or by pouring slowly over a strip of\r\nplate-glass at least two feet in length inclined at an angle of thirty\r\ndegrees. The sand will cling to the glass, while the greater portion of the\r\ndiatoms will run off. Where particles of shells or foraminifera are\r\npresent, a preliminary boiling in hydrochloric acid is advisable. In all\r\nmarine gatherings, the salt should first be washed out before proceeding\r\nwith the cleaning.\r\n\r\nFor hardened masses of clay and for fossil deposits, it is necessary to\r\nboil in carbonate of soda and follow with the acid treatment. Citric acid\r\nand acetate of potash used alternately in boiling may be tried. Soaking for\r\na time in acetate of potash and allowing the material to deliquesce for a\r\nweek before further process, has proved successful in some instances. The\r\nrepetition of several methods and the gentle breaking of the harder masses\r\nwith the point of a needle will disintegrate almost any diatomaceous earth,\r\nbut, as a last resort for refractory deposits, boil in pure water, add a\r\npiece of caustic potash about the size of a pea, continue the boiling not\r\nmore than thirty seconds longer, and pour instantly into dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid; otherwise the diatoms will be destroyed. Afterwards\r\nproceed with the usual treatment.\r\n\r\n_Slides and Covers._--Take half an ounce of No. 1 covers, circles, and\r\nplace them in a wide-mouthed bottle. Add a portion of the following mixture\r\n(Dr. Carl Seiler's formula):\r\n\r\n  Bichromate of potash    2 oz.\r\n  Sulphuric acid          3 fl. oz.\r\n  Water                   25 fl. oz.\r\n\r\nShake the bottle in order that the surfaces of the covers may be fully\r\nexposed to the action of the acid, and set aside for several hours. Decant\r\nthe solution, add water repeatedly until all traces of the mixture are\r\nremoved, and keep the circles in the bottle in fifty-per cent. alcohol.\r\nWhen needed, take out a circle with forceps and dry on a linen cloth.\r\n\r\nThe slides may be treated in the same way, or they may be easily prepared\r\nby immersion in a solution of washing soda, and then washed and dried. This\r\nprocess may be used in cleaning the balsam or styrax from old slides.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Strewn Mounts._--Place several covers on the mounting\r\nstand. With a dipping tube, cover each circle with distilled water, and add\r\na small drop of the prepared diatoms, being careful to avoid any vibration\r\nof the stand. Heat the stand until small bubbles begin to appear, remove\r\nthe lamp, and allow the water to evaporate. If the above method is\r\ncarefully followed, the diatoms will be deposited in an even layer,\r\nprovided the material is not too dense. Take a slide, centre it, and place\r\na small amount of styrax on the centre. Invert the prepared cover, and\r\ngently place it upon the styrax. Heat the slide {134}on the mounting stand\r\nuntil the styrax bubbles and then allow to cool. If bubbles still remain,\r\nheat again until they disappear. It is well to mount several slides more\r\nthan required, as some may be imperfect.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Selected Mounts._--Take a slide, place a minute quantity of\r\nbeeswax on two places at a distance apart nearly equal to the diameter of\r\nthe cover used. Place a cover on the wax and press it down flat, or\r\nsufficiently to keep it in position. Dip a fine needle into the following\r\ncement:\r\n\r\n  Glacial acetic acid    12 drachms\r\n  Gelatine                2 drachms\r\n  Alcohol                 1 drachm\r\n\r\nThis is made by adding the acid to the gelatine in a water-bath and then\r\nthe alcohol, and filtering. Apply the moistened needle to the centre of the\r\ncover and spread as small a quantity as possible in a thin layer. Now place\r\nthe slide upon the turn table, centre it with respect to the position of\r\nthe gelatine, and with the finest sable brush draw a circle about a tenth\r\nof an inch in diameter around the gelatine in water-color (Windsor), blue\r\nor vermilion, or in India ink. Instead of the water-color, a circle of\r\ntin-foil the size of the cover and pierced with a hole in the centre may be\r\nused, but the colored circle is to be preferred, as, when brought into\r\nview, it indicates exactly the focus required for observing the diatom.\r\n\r\nThe bottle containing the cleaned material, which has been kept in water\r\nand alcohol, should be refilled with distilled water and well shaken, when\r\na small portion may be taken up with a dipping tube and evenly distributed\r\nover a portion of a slide and then dried. By the use of a mechanical\r\nfinger, fitted with a small piece of finely spun glass attached by wax to\r\nthe holder of the finger, when the microscope is focussed until the glass\r\nthread touches the diatom selected, it will adhere to the thread. Raise the\r\nbody of the microscope, remove the slide containing the spread material, or\r\nmove it to another part of the stage, and place the slide with the prepared\r\ncover in the same position. Now carefully lower the body-tube of the\r\ninstrument until the diatom rests upon the gelatine, breathe gently upon\r\nit, remove the cover from the slide, invert it over another slide\r\ncontaining a drop of styrax and proceed by heating to mount as before. The\r\nsize of the diatom, the amount of gelatine, and several other factors, will\r\nenter into the question of success or failure. I have, however, employed\r\nthe above method and have mounted thousands of slides of selected diatoms\r\nsuccessfully. It is necessary to avoid any air current which will cause the\r\ndiatom to fall from the thread. On very cold days the glass thread\r\nsometimes becomes electrified and the diatoms will not stick; on sultry\r\ndays in August in our locality the diatoms will stick too closely.\r\n\r\nBy the same method, slides of arranged diatoms can be made using a glass\r\ncircle properly marked with lines in the eye-piece. Care should be taken to\r\nuse glass threads more or less in proportion to the size of the diatoms. A\r\ncat's whisker is preferred by some to the glass thread. It has the\r\nadvantage of not breaking, but unless it is quite short it is too flexible.\r\nIf the point of the thread becomes covered with gelatine, lower it into a\r\nminute drop of water upon a separate slide, and by moving it about it will\r\nbe cleaned. The diatom itself may be washed in the same way, if it is not\r\ntoo small.\r\n\r\n_Instruments Required._--For collecting, in order to determine the quality\r\nof the find, any simple lens of fifteen to twenty diameters is sufficient.\r\nA Stanhope is quite useful {135}although difficult to obtain, while an\r\nachromatic triplet of sufficient power will probably be all that is\r\nnecessary. For selecting with the mechanical finger, an objective of\r\ntwo-thirds-inch focus is the most convenient, but for determining species a\r\none-fifth-inch is needed, an immersion objective being essential for minute\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nNo particular form of microscope is required. Any instrument having\r\nstandard parts, inclination of the body to the axis, a sub-stage condenser\r\nand movable stage, will prove serviceable in nearly all investigations. For\r\ncritical work, measurement of striæ and location of specimens on the slide,\r\nthe large models of Bausch and Lomb leave nothing to be desired. One\r\nsmaller instrument may be used for rapid examination and for selection with\r\nthe mechanical finger. If the stage is supplied with a vernier, the diatoms\r\ncan be located rapidly and recorded for future reference. The Zentmayer\r\nArmy Hospital stand with mechanical stage is excellent. The Continental\r\nstands, convenient for laboratory work, especially in the examination of\r\nbacteria, are not so serviceable as the larger stands of American and\r\nEnglish make. The stand especially designed by Dr. Henri Van Heurck, the\r\ncelebrated Belgian naturalist, is, without doubt, admirably suited to the\r\ninvestigation of the Diatomaceæ. In the form of the Circuit Stage as made\r\nby Watson and Sons, of London, supplied with proper condenser and\r\nmechanical stage with vernier attachment, it has been used in the\r\npreparation of the present work with much satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe drawings have all been made with an Abbé camera lucida, a 3 mm.\r\nobjective and a No. 10 eye-piece, producing a magnification of about 800\r\ndiameters. All illustrations are from actual specimens in my cabinet or, in\r\na few instances, from slides sent me by friends. In the measurement of\r\nstriæ and puncta, the number in ten microns is stated, and will be found to\r\nbe approximately correct in most of the drawings, except when the number is\r\nin excess of twenty in ten microns, in which case it is impossible to\r\nrepresent the markings accurately on figures of the magnification adopted.\r\nAll drawings are from specimens in this locality, except in a few cases\r\nmentioned in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{137}INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n(SYNONYMS IN ITALICS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                PAGE\r\n  Achnanthes,                                     58\r\n    brevipes Ag.,                                 59\r\n    coarctata (Bréb.)
